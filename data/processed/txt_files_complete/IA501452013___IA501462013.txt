                               Law Associates LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the first claimant's appeal against
    a decision by the Secretary of State to refuse to grant  her  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 2 Migrant.  The second claimant joined in  her  appeal
    as a partner of a PBS Migrant, and his appeal was allowed in line  with
    hers.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and
    I do not consider that such an order is warranted for these proceedings
    in the Upper Tribunal.

2.   I shall refer to the first claimant hereafter simply as  the  claimant,
    save where the context otherwise requires.

3.   The claimant made her application for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  2
    Migrant in October 2013.  Her job title was that  of  an  architectural
    assistant.  Her gross annual salary was �20,500.  The  sponsor  of  her
    application was Paul Archer Design Ltd.

4.   Prior to the application, the claimant had  entered  into  a  full-time
    contract with PAD which contained the following standard term under the
    heading of "Office Hours":

         B100  The standard working week is 40 hours which includes half  an
         hour - break every day.  Break time is not paid time.

5.   For the purposes of the application, it was necessary for the  employer
    to  complete  a  certificate  of  sponsorship.   The   certificate   of
    sponsorship was completed by Mr Paul Archer of PAD.  Under the  heading
    of "Work Dates" he was asked to state  the  applicant's  "total  weekly
    hours of work".  The information he gave was "40.00".

6.   In a subsequent witness statement, Mr Archer said  that  the  form  did
    not allow him to specify whether breaks were included.   He  stated  40
    hours in the certificate of sponsorship to make sure that  he  provided
    information to the authorities which was consistent with the  company's
    internal documentation which was that the appellant's standard  working
    week was 40 hours.  Unfortunately, he  was  not  advised  by  the  Home
    Office or by the sponsor licence unit or by the  caseworker  who  dealt
    with the appellant's Tier 2 application to clarify the actual hours for
    which she was going to get paid.

7.   On 12 November 2013  the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for
    refusing the claimant's  application,  and  for  making  a  concomitant
    decision to remove her from the UK by way of directions  under  Section
    47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The  salary
    included on her certificate of sponsorship was  not  at  or  above  the
    appropriate rate for the job, as specified  under  Appendix  A  of  the
    Rules and the Codes of Practice (and also specified under Appendix J of
    the Immigration Rules).  The minimum acceptable rate of pay  for  a  39
    hour working week for her prospective employment was �20,300 per annum,
    as stated in occupation code 2431 under  the  new  entrant  appropriate
    salary rate.  The certificate of sponsorship  stated  that  the  salary
    would be �20,500 per  annum  for  a  40  hour  week  which  equated  to
    �19,987.50 per annum for a 39 hour week.


8.   The grounds of appeal were settled by the claimant's solicitors.   They
    argued that the decision was not  in  accordance  with  the  law.   The
    Secretary of State had  failed  to  apply  her  evidential  flexibility
    policy.  If the claimant or her sponsor had been alerted to  the  error
    of a mathematical mistake in salary calculation, the sponsor could have
    submitted a corrected document.  Alternatively, the appeal ought to  be
    allowed under Article 8 ECHR.  She had resided in the UK for over eight
    years.  She had  completed  a  degree  in  architecture  and  had  been
    employed in her field by a British  firm  of  architects.   Her  career
    options in Belarus were very limited and virtually non-existent.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

9.   The claimant's appeal came before Judge Flynn  sitting  in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal at Taylor House on 29 May 2014.   Mr  Norman  of  Counsel
    appeared on behalf of the claimants  and  Miss  Laverack,  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer, appeared on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State.
    (Judge Flynn refers to Mr Norman as "Ms", but the skeleton argument was
    prepared by "Julian Norman"). The judge  received  oral  evidence  from
    both claimants, and also from Mr Archer.  Neither  he  nor  the  second
    claimant was cross-examined.

10.  In her closing submissions on behalf of the Secretary  of  State,  Miss
    Laverack submitted that the certificate clearly stated that  the  first
    claimant's total weekly hours of work were 40.  There was no indication
    that this was not the correct number of  hours,  and  no  contract  was
    submitted with the application.  It was not for the Secretary of  State
    to speculate that the claimant was working for only 37.5 hours a  week,
    rather  than  the  40  hours  a  week  stated  in  the  certificate  of
    sponsorship.

11.  Mr Norman submitted that the sponsorship form  was  inadequate  because
    there was no space in which  the  sponsor  could  explain  the  working
    arrangements.  The Secretary of State was not entitled in law to assume
    that all the 40 hours stated were paid.  Furthermore, Appendix J stated
    that the Secretary of State assumed a working week of 37� hours.

12.  In her subsequent determination, the  judge  found  in  favour  of  the
    claimants.  She accepted the evidence of the  first  claimant  and  her
    employer that they did not appreciate how her working hours  should  be
    calculated and had made a mistake in stating 40 rather than 37.5:

         I appreciate this evidence was not provided to  the  [SSHD]  before
         she made her decision, but I agree with  [Mr]  Norman's  submission
         that the [SSHD's] conclusion was  erroneous  in  the  circumstances
         since it was based on a false assumption which was unjustified.

13.  The judge went on in paragraph 32 to hold as follows:

         Given the lack of clarity in the [SSHD's] questions, I consider she
         had a duty to ask for the contract  in  accordance  with  Rodriguez
         (flexibility policy) [2013] UKUT  0042  (IAC),  where  McCloskey  J
         decided that all case owners  should  have  regard  to  the  policy
         before deciding an application.   I  find  the  SSHD's  failure  to
         consider this aspect and to make proper enquiries, meant  that  her
         decision was not in accordance with the law.

14.  Even if she accepted that the Secretary of State had no  obligation  to
    check with the claimant as to whether all her working hours were  paid,
    she agreed with Counsel's submission that the new evidence relating  to
    the contract of employment was admissible in  accordance  with  Section
    85A(4)(b), because it related to the first claimant's human rights.

15.  Judge Flynn went on to allow the  first  claimant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules, as she pronounced herself satisfied  that  her  paid
    working hours were 37.5 per week and therefore  her  earnings  were  at
    least the appropriate rate and therefore met the required threshold.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

16.  On 29 July 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         It is arguable the judge has misdirected herself


         (a)  in finding at paragraph  32  of  the  determination  that  the
             [SSHD]  could  have   required   submission   of   the   first
             (claimant's) contract of employment to check her  paid  weekly
             hours in terms of Rodriguez (flexibility policy)  [2013]  UKUT
             0042 (IAC) when this case was overturned in the case of SSHD v
             Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 42, and


         (b)  in finding at paragraph 33  of  the  determination  that  this
             evidence was  admissible  because  it  related  to  the  first
             [claimant's] human rights when the judge went on to allow  the
             appeal under the Immigration Rules and  not  on  human  rights
             grounds.  In addition it is arguable that this finding had  no
             regard to the Immigration Rules as  they  applied  to  private
             life  and  no  consideration  was  given  as  to  whether  the
             circumstances require consideration outside the Rules.

The Error of Law Hearing on 17 October 2014

17.  At the hearing before me, Mr Duffy developed the  arguments  raised  in
    the application for permission  to  appeal.   Mr  Hone  relied  on  the
    skeleton  argument  that  Mr  Norman  had  put  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

18.  The judge was clearly in error in allowing the claimant's appeal  under
    the Rules.  The contracts of employment were  not  admissible  for  the
    purpose of salvaging the claimant's position under the Rules.  Although
    the judge purported to admit the contracts of employment into  evidence
    on the grounds that they were relevant to her alternative  claim  under
    Article  8,  the  judge  impermissibly  relied  on  the  contracts   of
    employment  as  establishing  retrospectively  that  the  claimant  was
    entitled to be awarded points under paragraph 79 of Appendix A  for  an
    appropriate salary.

19.  The less straightforward question is whether the judge erred in law  in
    finding that the Secretary of State had  breached  her  own  evidential
    flexibility policy and ought to have queried the information  given  in
    the certificate of sponsorship before making an adverse decision on the
    application.

20.  The claimant's case as put by Mr Norman in his  skeleton  argument  was
    that there was no capacity on the certificate of  sponsorship  form  to
    give "these vital details", namely that the claimant's 40 hour contract
    was inclusive of unpaid breaks amounting to two and a  half  hours,  so
    that she was in fact only working a  37.5  hour  week.   Mr  Hone  went
    further.  He submitted that the sponsorship form was so ambiguous as to
    be misleading, and that the Secretary of State had  in  effect  induced
    the employer to make an understandable error.

21.  It is necessary for me to focus on the judge's line of reasoning.   She
    pronounced herself satisfied that the Secretary of State did not intend
    unpaid breaks to be counted,  as  set  out  in  a  posting  on  the  UK
    government website entitled  "Calculating  your  working  hours".   She
    found that the employer did not appreciate how the  claimant's  working
    hours should be calculated in order  to  answer  the  question  in  the
    sponsorship form correctly.  She found there was a duty to ask for  the
    employment contract because of the "lack of clarity" in  the  questions
    in the form.  But this last finding is logically inconsistent with  her
    earlier finding that the  government  website  informs  applicants  and
    sponsors as to how working hours should  be  calculated.   It  is  also
    inconsistent with her finding that  the  Secretary  of  State  did  not
    intend unpaid breaks to be counted.  If it was  not  the  Secretary  of
    State's intention that unpaid breaks  should  be  counted  towards  the
    total weekly hours of work, and information  as  to  how  to  calculate
    working hours correctly is provided on the UK  government  website,  it
    follows that the caseworker dealing with the claimant's application had
    no reason to perceive the question as being unclear or to suppose  that
    the employer would not know how to answer the  question  correctly.  It
    also follows that the caseworker would have no reason to  suppose  that
    the information given in the sponsorship form was  inaccurate;  and  no
    reason to suspect that the claimant's  true  working  hours  were  37.5
    rather than 40.

22.  If the relevant contract of  employment  had  been  provided  with  the
    application, the caseworker would have been put on  notice  that  there
    was a discrepancy between the information given in the sponsorship form
    and what was stated in the contract.  In such  circumstances,  arguably
    the caseworker would have been  under  a  duty  to  seek  clarification
    before making an adverse decision  on  the  application.   But  on  the
    information available to  the  caseworker  and  in  the  light  of  the
    guidance given by the  Court  of  Appeal  when  overturning  the  Upper
    Tribunal decision in Rodriguez, Judge Flynn  was  wrong  to  find  that
    there was a  breach  of  evidential  flexibility  principles.   On  the
    accepted presumption  that  unpaid  breaks  were  not  intended  to  be
    included in the total figure, there was nothing to alert  a  reasonable
    caseworker that the sponsor had made a mistake in the completion of the
    certificate of sponsorship.

23.  It is convenient now to deal with the alternative way the case  is  now
    put by Mr Hone.  This is in  effect  that  the  question  posed  is  so
    ambiguous and misleading as to generate a common law duty in every case
    to check whether the hours given by the sponsor include  unpaid  breaks
    or not.  I find in Mr Duffy's favour on this issue.   I  consider  that
    the question is sufficiently clear.  What is being  asked  for  is  the
    number of hours each  week  that  the  employee  actually  works.   The
    employer can reasonably  be  expected  to  appreciate  the  distinction
    between (a) hours of work and (b) break periods which are unpaid and so
    do not count towards hours of work.

24.  Accordingly, the judge erred in law in finding that the decision  under
    appeal was not in accordance with the law.  On the evidence,  the  only
    sustainable ground of appeal was the alternative claim under Article  8
    ECHR.

25.  The judge's consideration  of  the  Article  8  claim  is  procedurally
    flawed for two reasons.  Firstly, the judge does not begin her  Article
    8 assessment by considering whether the claimant has a  viable  private
    life claim under Rule 276ADE.  Secondly, if she does not have a  viable
    claim under Rule  276ADE,  the  judge  failed  to  identify  compelling
    factors not sufficiently recognised under the  Rules  as  part  of  her
    proportionality assessment of an Article  8  claim  which  is  advanced
    outside the Rules.

26.  For the above reasons, the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    vitiated by a material error of law such that it has to be set aside in
    its entirety.

The Scope and Forum for the Remaking of the Decision

27.  As I stated in my error of law  ruling,  the  claimant's  appeal  could
    succeed under the Rules or on  the  basis  that  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State was otherwise not in accordance with the law.  But I
    accepted Mr Hone's submission that the  Article  8  claim  outside  the
    Rules was  potentially  fortified  by  the  statutory  public  interest
    considerations which have been introduced into  the  2002  Act  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014.  I considered that the  Upper  Tribunal  was  the
    appropriate forum for a rehearing of the discrete issues raised by  the
    Article 8 claim, and I gave directions for a resumed hearing before me.

The Resumed Hearing on 5 December 2014

28.  Ms Prus adopted as her evidence-in-chief her witness statement  in  the
    supplementary bundle signed on 26 November 2014.  She was a  Belarusian
    citizen, whose date of birth was 26 December 1985.  She had come to the
    UK in 2005 as a student, and had been residing lawfully in the  UK  for
    over nine years.  She had married her husband, the second claimant,  on
    23 August 2009 in Belarus.  She had known her husband  from  childhood.
    They had formed a relationship in 2004 when they were both aged 18.  He
    first came to the UK as a student in  2006/2007,  and  they  had  lived
    together in the UK.  He had then gone  back  to  Belarus  in  order  to
    complete his education.  He then returned to the  UK  in  2010  as  her
    student dependant, and he had since been  residing  lawfully  here  for
    four years.

29.  She had been  employed  by  Paul  Archer  Design  as  an  architectural
    assistant since July 2012, earning �23,000 per annum plus bonuses.  She
    was recently given a pay rise.  Her current  employer  is  prepared  to
    sponsor her under Tier 2.  But her application under Tier 2 was refused
    due to a technical  error  in  the  certificate  of  sponsorship.   Her
    experience and qualifications would not be  given  recognition  if  she
    sought employment in Belarus.  There is  no  creativity  in  Belarusian
    architecture, and due to limitations in sourcing  materials,  the  work
    available was limited.  She would not be able to pursue  her  education
    as an architect in Belarus, as she would not be  able  support  herself
    and because she would not meet  entry  requirements  of  the  education
    institutions.  She believed she would  have  difficulties  in  securing
    employment in Belarus.  All  her  experience  and  education  had  been
    geared  towards  working  in  London,  which  is  a  leading  city  for
    architecture.

30.  Her father was an Irish  citizen  and  had  lived  for  many  years  in
    Ireland.  Her mother had also resided in Ireland for a long time.   Her
    parents  were  currently  living  in  Belarus,  but  planned  to   move
    permanently to the UK in January 2015.  Her  brother  was  residing  in
    Germany with his family, and  he  had  no  intention  of  returning  to
    Belarus.

31.  She had come to the UK when aged  19,  and  her  formative  years  were
    spent here.  She was integrated into UK society.  She  participated  in
    various activities, including attending art galleries  and  exhibitions
    and lectures and drawing classes.  She  supported  an  anti-development
    conservation campaign within her local community  in  Stoke  Newington,
    trying to stop a new development in her local area as she  believed  it
    would ruin small businesses and destroy historic sites.  She  supported
    UK charities such as the RSPCA.

32.  In answer to supplementary questions from Mr Fripp, Ms  Prus  explained
    that she hoped to go on to study part 2 of  her  architectural  course.
    She had in fact taken a break from studying after  completing  part  1,
    and had been gaining work experience  with  Paul  Archer  Design.   She
    hoped to become a fully qualified architect in the UK, and to establish
    her own practice.  Her father had  acquired  Irish  citizenship,  as  a
    result of working in Ireland for eight to nine years.  The plan was for
    her parents to join them here in the same household, and for her father
    to find a job.  Attention was drawn to one of the letters of support in
    the appellants' bundle at page 34.  He confirmed the contents  of  this
    letter of support from James Poletyllo.  He worked as the head of human
    resources for Voyage Care, an organisation which  provided  support  to
    people with learning disabilities and acquired brain injuries.  He said
    he had known the couple for the past six months, as they shared a  flat
    with his girlfriend.  Whilst they both spoke what he considered to be a
    very high standard of English, they are constantly asking for  feedback
    and trying to  improve  their  level  of  English  by  expanding  their
    vocabulary and trying to understand  customs  and  colloquialisms.   He
    believed that Vohla and Vas were an extremely  honest  and  hardworking
    couple, who would continue  to  be  valuable  members  of  their  local
    community and British society.

33.  In cross-examination, Ms Prus agreed with Mr Bramble that she  and  her
    husband had a major connection with Belarus as they had met each  other
    there, and had attended the same  school  together.   She  had  been  a
    university student in Belarus.  She had done nearly two years of a five-
    year course in a different subject.  She had not completed  the  second
    year, as she had not sat the relevant exams.  Her  last  pay  rise  had
    been in March.

34.  In answer to questions for clarification purposes  from  me,  she  said
    that she satisfied the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  to  be
    granted further leave to remain as a Tier 2 Migrant.  But she  had  not
    made a new application, as she  would  need  to  withdraw  her  present
    appeal in order to do so.

35.  Mr Barycheuski was called as a witness, and he adopted as his evidence-
    in-chief his witness statement signed on 26 November 2014.   He  was  a
    service engineer technician employed by St Giles  Hotel,  earning  over
    �22,000.  He had been in this employment since 2012.  He had had a semi-
    military education in Belarus.  He was a border  force  civil  servant.
    At the beginning of his university education, he had  had  to  sign  an
    agreement with the  KGB  in  Belarus  to  allow  them  to  monitor  his
    activities.  He recently received a  notification  from  Facebook  that
    someone had tried to access his  account  from  Minsk.   This  occurred
    shortly after he had "liked" the Free  Belarusian  Theatre  documentary
    movie entitled "Dangerous Acts", which is on the topic of human  rights
    violations in Belarus.  His actions  may  have  been  observed  by  the
    security services in Belarus.  But they knew that he was in the UK, and
    might be  supporting  the  anti-president  movement,  this  might  have
    serious and dangerous consequences for him.

36.  He believed he had difficulties in securing employment in Belarus.   He
    had not been employed there for five years, and his qualifications were
    not up-to-date and would count for very  little.   He  integrated  into
    society in the UK.  His participation included taking part in the three
    peaks challenge in July to raise money  for  YMCA,  and  children  with
    disabilities in the UK.  He also aimed to take part in a  triathlon  in
    Spring 2015 to raise money to MMD Association.

37.  In answer to supplementary questions from Mr Fripp, he  said  that  his
    current pay was �23,500.  He was also due to receive a Christmas bonus.
     He was asked about his liking the Free Belarusian Theatre  documentary
    movie on Facebook.   He  explained  he  did  not  support  the  current
    government in Belarus.  He would have done the same  thing  in  Belarus
    (that is expressed a liking for the  movie).   He  was  supporting  the
    movement before he left Belarus.   He  had  a  greater  opportunity  to
    support the movement in London.  In Belarus you had to be  careful,  as
    there was not an official opposition.  If  you  are  not  careful,  you
    could lose your job.  On return to Belarus, the KGB might question  him
    if he tried to get a government job.  They might ask  him  why  he  had
    expressed support for the Belarusian Theatre documentary movie.

38.  In cross-examination, Mr Barycheuski said he was not  able  to  produce
    any evidence of the notification as he could not do a  screen  shot  of
    it.  The attempt to access his Facebook account from  Minsk  could  not
    have been successful.

39.  In his closing  submissions  on  behalf  of  the  claimants,  Mr  Fripp
    submitted  that  the  claimants  could  bring  themselves  within  Rule
    276ADE(1)(vi).   This  is  because  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to their integration into the country  to  which  they  would
    have to go if required to leave the  UK.   Alternatively,  they  should
    succeed in a freestanding Article 8 claim  outside  the  Rules.   There
    were numerous letters of support testifying to  their  good  character.
    The first claimant's family in Belarus was in the course  of  dispersal
    to other countries.  She had spent the bulk of her life as an adult  in
    the UK, and most of her secondary education had  been  conducted  here.
    There were a number of factors  in  Section  117B  which  were  in  the
    claimants' favour.  They  spoke  English,  and  they  were  financially
    independent.  Their relationship had not been formed  at  a  time  when
    their immigration status was precarious.  They had always been lawfully
    present in the UK throughout  their  respective  periods  of  residence
    here.  While the first claimant could make a fresh Tier 2  application,
    she would lose the right to work while she was waiting for a decision.

40.  On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Bramble relied on  passages  in
    Patel and Others v Secretary of State [2013] UKSC 72 and in Naseem  and
    Others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 25 (IAC).

Discussion and Findings

41.  The latest version of Rule 276ADE(vi) is potentially  more  helpful  to
    the claimants.  For they indisputably did not satisfy the  old  version
    of the rule, which was that they should have no ties to the country  of
    return.  But on analysis the  evidence  does  not  establish  that  the
    couple would face very significant obstacles in reintegrating into life
    in Belarus, where they were born and brought up, and  spent  all  their
    formative years as minors.  Essentially, the first  claimant's  private
    life claim is based on a comparison between the rich private life  that
    she enjoys here with the less good private life which she  would  enjoy
    in Belarus on return.  But Article 8 does not confer on an applicant  a
    right to work or study in the country of his or her choice.  The  focus
    in Rule 276ADE(vi) is not  on  the  frustration  of  an  understandable
    ambition to achieve a better life, but  on  the  difficulties  for  the
    applicant of reintegrating into the country of his or her  nationality.
    It is credible that the opportunities for  an  architect  are  less  in
    Belarus than they are in London.  But this is not something  which  can
    attract Article 8 relief.

42.  The same  points  apply  to  the  private  life  claim  of  the  second
    claimant, insofar as he  relies  on  similar  considerations  as  those
    relied on by his wife. He also relies on an additional  factor,  namely
    that he signed an agreement with the  KGB  to  be  monitored  by  them.
    However, it is not suggested that the second claimant  has  nonetheless
    not been able  to  lead  a  reasonable  life  in  Belarus  despite  the
    monitoring agreement, and the  need  to  be  careful  about  expressing
    public opposition to the government.  The second claimant said he would
    have expressed a like for the documentary  theatre  movie  in  Belarus,
    despite the need to be careful  there.   This  shows  that  the  second
    claimant's freedom of expression is not so restricted in  Belarus  that
    he cannot lead  an  adequate  private  life  in  Belarus.   It  is  not
    suggested  that  the  second  claimant  has  a  well-founded  fear   of
    persecution on return to Belarus on account of his  actual  or  imputed
    political opinion.

43.  Turning to an Article 8 claim outside the  Rules,  I  accept  that  the
    evidence  relied  on  by  the  claimants  is  sufficiently  cogent  and
    compelling to pass the Gulshan threshold test.  I refer  to  the  five-
    point Razgar test, and I agree with Mr Fripp that questions 1 and 2  of
    the Razgar test should be answered in the claimants' favour with regard
    to the establishment of private life in the  United  Kingdom.   I  find
    that questions 3 and 4 of the Razgar test should be answered in  favour
    of the Secretary of State, and so the crucial question is  whether  the
    interference  consequential  upon  the  immigration  decision  appealed
    against is proportionate.

44.   On  this  question,  the  formidable  legal  obstacles  faced  by  the
    claimants include the observations of Lord Carnwath at paragraphs  [56]
    and [57] of  Patel.   A  near  miss  under  the  Rules  cannot  provide
    substance to a human rights case which is otherwise lacking  in  merit.
    It is important to remember that Article 8 is not a general  dispensing
    power.  One may sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for  common
    sense in the application of  the  Rules  to  graduates  who  have  been
    studying in the UK for some years.  However, such considerations do not
    by themselves provide grounds of appeal  under  Article  8,  which  are
    concerned with private or family life,  not  education  as  such.   The
    opportunity for a promising student to  complete  his  course  in  this
    country, however desirable in general terms,  is  not  itself  a  right
    protected under Article 8.

45.  In Naseem, the Tribunal said at paragraph [20]:

         We therefore agree with Mr Jarvis that [57] of Patel and Others  is
         significant exhortation for the Supreme Court to refocus  attention
         on the nature and purpose of  Article  8  and,  in  particular,  to
         recognise its limited utility to an individual where one has  moved
         along the continuum, from that Article's  core  area  of  operation
         towards  what  might  be  described  as  its  fuzzy  penumbra.    A
         limitation arises, both from what will at that  point  normally  be
         the  tangential  effect  on  the   individual   of   the   proposed
         interference and from the fact that, unless  there  are  particular
         reasons to reduce the  public  interest  of  enforcing  immigration
         controls, that interest will consequently prevail in  striking  the
         proportionality balance (even assuming that stage is reached).

46.  The Tribunal went on to conclude that the nature of the right  asserted
    by each of the appellants, based on their desire as former students  to
    undertake a period of post-study work in the United Kingdom, lay at the
    outer reaches of cases requiring an affirmative answer to the second of
    the five Razgar questions and that, even if such an affirmative  answer
    needs to be given, the issue of  proportionality  was  to  be  resolved
    decisively in favour of the Secretary of State,  by  reference  to  her
    functions as the  guardian  of  the  system  of  immigration  controls,
    entrusted to her by Parliament.

47.   Section 117A requires the court or Tribunal to apply Section 117B  and
    Section 117C when it is required to determine whether a  decision  made
    under the Immigration Acts breaches Article 8 so it would  be  unlawful
    under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  Section  117B  sets  out
    public interest considerations applicable in all cases.  I  agree  with
    Mr Fripp that some of these public interest considerations militate  in
    the claimants' favour.  It is in the public interest, and in particular
    in the interest of the economic wellbeing of the United  Kingdom,  that
    persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able  to
    speak English, because persons who can speak English (a) are less of  a
    burden on taxpayers, and (b) are better able to integrate into society.
     The same point applies to persons who are financially independent.  On
    the other hand, the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
    the public interest.  Furthermore, it is expressly provided that little
    weight should be given to a private life established by a person  at  a
    time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is   precarious.    The
    immigration status of both claimants has at all times been  precarious,
    not because they are here unlawfully, but simply because they have only
    been granted limited leave to enter or remain,  and  their  ability  to
    remain here was dependent on them being able to  satisfy  the  relevant
    Immigration Rule for an extension of their stay.

48.  Article 8 cannot be used as a consolation prize for those who try,  but
    fail, to bring themselves  within  the  Rules.   So  while  I  am  very
    sympathetic to the claimants' plight, which comes about because  of  an
    unfortunate error (and not because the  first  claimant  is  unable  to
    satisfy the relevant requirements for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  2
    Migrant) I am unable to find, applying Section 117B of  the  2002  Act,
    that the proposed interference is disproportionate.  I am reinforced in
    this finding by the consideration that it is open to the  claimants  to
    make a fresh application under Tier 2 within 28 days  of  their  appeal
    rights being deemed to be exhausted.  In such circumstances, they  will
    not be treated as overstayers.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside  and  the
following decision is substituted: these appeals  are  dismissed  under  the
Rules and under Article 8 ECHR.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
