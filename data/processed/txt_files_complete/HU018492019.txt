     DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
                            TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Gambia, appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    ("FtT") against a decision dated 16 December 2018, being a decision  to
    refuse entry clearance as the child of a parent present and settled  in
    the United Kingdom. The FtT dismissed the appeal.

 2. Permission to appeal the decision of the FtT having been  granted,  the
    appeal came before me. At the hearing before me it was  agreed  between
    the parties that the FtT erred in law for the reasons advanced  in  the
    grounds of appeal upon which permission to appeal was granted  (and  to
    which reference should be made for a full understanding of  the  errors
    of law).

 3. It was further agreed between the parties that the errors  of  law  are
    such as to require the decision of the FtT to be set aside and for  the
    appeal to be remitted to the FtT for a hearing de novo.

 4. In the circumstances, I set aside the decision of the FtT for error  of
    law and remit the appeal to the FtT for  a  hearing  de  novo,  on  all
    grounds, before a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Row,  with
    no findings of fact preserved.

 5. In remitting the appeal I have had  regard  to  paragraph  7.2  of  the
    Practice Statement of the Senior President of Tribunals.

 6. Pursuant to rule 40(3)(a) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, no reasons (or further reasons) are required, the  decision
    being made with the consent of the parties.
