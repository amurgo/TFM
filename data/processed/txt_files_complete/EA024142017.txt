Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr U Okoroh instructed by Gromyko Amedu Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 2 August 1982.

 2. On 10 November 2010, the appellant married  a  French  national,  [KB],
    through a traditional Nigerian marriage ceremony.  On 8 April 2011  the
    appellant was issued with a residence card as a family member  (spouse)
    of an EEA national under the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  (SI
    2006/1003 as amended) (the "EEA  Regulations  2006").   That  residence
    card was valid until 13 September 2016.

 3. On 31 August 2016, the appellant applied for a permanent residence card
    on the basis that, following her divorce from her former  spouse  on  6
    April 2016 she had a retained right of residence which, when taken with
    her residence in the UK prior to her divorce, gave rise to a  permanent
    right of residence under reg 15(1)(f) based upon five years  continuous
    residence in the UK.

 4. On 21 February 2017, the Secretary of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    application under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1052)
    (the "EEA Regulations 2016")  which  had,  by  the  date  of  decision,
    replaced the EEA Regulations 2006.  As relevant to the issues  in  this
    appeal, the two sets of Regulations are materially the same in regs  14
    ("extended right of residence"), 15 ("right  of  permanent  residence")
    and regs 18 and 19 respectively (permanent residence documentation).

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 16  May  2018  Judge  Geraint  Jones  QC  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal.  The judge  found  that  the  appellant  could  not
    establish that she had a permanent right of residence because she could
    not show that she had resided in the UK  in  accordance  with  the  EEA
    Regulations 2006 after 31 December 2012 as she could not establish that
    she had been living with her spouse.

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal, inter alia,  on  the  ground
    that the judge had misdirected himself in requiring that the  appellant
    be living with her  husband  whilst  they  were  married  in  order  to
    establish a right of residence under the EEA Regulations 2006.

 7. On 12 July 2018, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  P  J  M  Hollingworth)
    granted the appellant permission to appeal.

 8. At the hearing before me, Ms Fijiwala, who represented the Secretary of
    State, accepted that the judge had erred in law  in  applying  the  EEA
    Regulations 2006 and 2016.  She accepted that, in order to establish  a
    right of residence, the appellant did not have to  show  that  she  was
    living with her spouse in the UK.  She accepted, in the light of  Upper
    Tribunal's decision in PM (EEA  -  spouse  -  "residing  with")  Turkey
    [2011] UKUT 89 (IAC), that it was not necessary to establish a right of
    residence as a family member of a "qualified person" under  reg  14  of
    the EEA Regulations 2006 and  2016  that  the  family  member  (spouse)
    should be living with his or her spouse.  It sufficed  that  they  were
    both in the UK even if they were  not  living  together.   Ms  Fijiwala
    accepted that the judge's decision should, as  a  consequence,  be  set
    aside.

 9. Further, having considered the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal,
    Ms Fijiwala accepted that the appellant  could  establish  a  permanent
    right of residence under reg 15(1)(b)  of  the  EEA  Regulations  2016
    (which is in the same terms as reg  15(1)(b)  of  the  EEA  Regulations
    2006) based upon her residence in the UK for  a  continuous  period  of
    five years  in  accordance  with  the  EEA  Regulations.   Ms  Fijiwala
    accepted that the evidence demonstrated that the appellant's spouse was
    a "qualified person", as a worker, from 4 January 2011 as evidenced  by
    the P60 documents at pages 31 and 32 of the bundle.  She accepted  that
    the appellant's spouse was a "qualified person"  for  a  period  of  at
    least five years thereafter.  Consequently, between 4 January 2011  and
    4 January 2016, the appellant could show that she had resided in the UK
    as the spouse of a "qualified person" for a period  of  five  years  in
    accordance with the EEA  Regulations  2006.   Under  reg  15(1)(b),  Ms
    Fijiwala accepted that, therefore,  the  appellant  had  established  a
    permanent right of residence.

10. I agree with the position taken by Ms Fijiwala.

11. First, the judge clearly misdirected himself in requiring the appellant
    to establish that she was residing with her spouse  in  order  to  show
    that she was residing in accordance with the EEA Regulations 2006.

12. Regulation 14(2) of the EEA Regulations 2006 provides that:

             "a family member of a qualified person residing in the  United
             Kingdom under paragraph (1)...is entitled to reside ("remain")
             in the United Kingdom for so long as  he  remains  the  family
             member  of  the  qualified  person  ("that  person")  or   EEA
             national."

    (The words in  brackets  reflect  the  different  wording  in  the  EEA
    Regulations 2016 but which do not affect its meaning.)

13. Regulation 15(1)(b) of the EEA Regulations 2006 recognises a "permanent
    right of residence" is acquired by:

             "a family member of an EEA national who is not himself an  EEA
             national but who has resided in the United  Kingdom  with  the
             EEA national  in  accordance  with  these  Regulations  for  a
             continuous period of five years."

    (The wording of reg  15(1)(b)  of  the  EEA  Regulations  2016  is  not
    materially different.)

14. There is no requirement in reg 14(2) that the EEA national and  his  or
    her spouse should be living together in the same household and,  as  PM
    makes plain, it is not a prerequisite to the acquisition of a permanent
    right of residence under reg 15(1)(b).  The requirement to  reside  "in
    the United Kingdom with the EEA national" simply means that the  family
    member (as well as the EEA national) must have resided in the  UK  (see
    [12] and [33] of PM).

15. Secondly, the evidence demonstrates that from 4 January  2011  until  4
    January 2016 - a continuous period of five years -  the  appellant  and
    her spouse lived in the UK (albeit not together for the whole  of  that
    period) and during that period the sponsor was  a  "qualified  person".
    The appellant was, accordingly, residing in the UK for that  period  in
    accordance with the right of residence recognised in reg 14(2)  of  the
    EEA Regulations 2006.  At the conclusion of that five-year period,  the
    appellant acquired a permanent right of  residence  by  virtue  of  reg
    15(1)(b) of the EEA Regulations 2006.  She,  therefore,  acquired  that
    permanent right of residence prior to her divorce on 6 April 2016.  Her
    divorce did not affect her permanent right of residence which continued
    to exist.  She did not need to rely on a retained right of residence at
    the date of divorce.  She already had a permanent  right  of  residence
    prior to her divorce.

Decision

16. Consequently, the First-tier Tribunal erred in law  in  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal.  That decision is set aside.

17. For the reasons I have  given,  I  remake  the  decision  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal on the basis that she has  established  a  permanent
    right of residence which came into existence on 4 January 2016 and  is,
    on production of the required documentation, entitled  to  a  permanent
    residence card under reg 19 of the EEA Regulations 2016.
