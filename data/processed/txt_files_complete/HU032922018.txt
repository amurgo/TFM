Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr G Hodgetts instructed by ATM Law Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State appeals with permission to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against the decision of a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the
    appeal of Mr Ali against  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  of  10
    January 2018 by refusing his application for indefinite leave to remain
    on the basis of ten years lawful continuous residence.  I  shall  refer
    hereafter to Mr Ali as the appellant, as he was before the  judge,  and
    to the Secretary of State as the respondent,  as  she  was  before  the
    judge.

2.   The judge noted that the appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on  11
    January 2007 with a student visa and had further periods  of  leave  up
    until 9 March 2017.  On that date he made the application, the  refusal
    of which was the subject of the appeal.   The  respondent  refused  the
    application under paragraph 322(5) of HC 395.  She found  that  in  the
    appellant's previous Tier 1 (General) application on 12 March  2011  he
    had claimed previous earnings of �55,309.99 from employment  and  self-
    employment between 1 February 2010 and 31 January 2011.  The  appellant
    had claimed to have earned �16,401.99 through employment and �38,908.17
    through self-employment.  He had submitted documentary evidence in  the
    form of payslips, accountant's letters and invoices which showed him to
    have earned sufficient earnings to be awarded  35  points  and  he  had
    accordingly been granted leave as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.

3.   Following that period of leave he submitted a further application as  a
    Tier 1 (General) Migrant, on 23  April  2013.   There  he  claimed  his
    previous earnings of �55,323 covering the period between 11 April  2012
    and 10 April 2013.  He claimed to have  earned  �34,200  through  self-
    employment and �21,123 through employment.

4.   In respect of the current application  the  judge  did  not  accept  in
    respect of the answer at question 14 of the tax questionnaire that  the
    appellant's accountant would have declared earnings considerably  lower
    than the actual amount claimed by the  appellant  on  his  application.
    The respondent found it was the appellant's  responsibility  to  ensure
    that the tax returns submitted by him had the correct  information  and
    that his failure to do so was deceitful and dishonest.

5.   The respondent carried out checks with HMRC which  confirmed  that  the
    appellant's total income from self-employment for the tax  year  ending
    April 2011 was �4,300 and his income from PAYE employment  amounted  to
    �16,318.  With regard to the tax year ending April 2013 he  had  earned
    �21,123 from PAYE employment and no earnings for  self-employment.   In
    both cases the figures were significantly lower  than  the  amounts  in
    excess of �55,000 that the appellant had claimed to the  respondent  to
    have earned.

6.   The respondent was not satisfied that the information declared to  HMRC
    in relation to the self-employed earnings was  genuine  and  considered
    that the appellant had misrepresented his earnings so as  to  meet  the
    Tier 1 (General) Migrant requirements.  His application for  indefinite
    leave to remain on the  basis  of  ten  years  unlawful  residence  was
    refused with reference to paragraph 322(5) of HC 395.  In addition  the
    application was refused in respect of paragraph 276ADE(1)  of  HC  395.
    The respondent did not find that there were  exceptional  circumstances
    to warrant the exercise of discretion to grant leave under Article 8 of
    the ECHR.

7.   At the hearing before the  judge  the  appellant  adopted  his  witness
    statement which  set  out  the  earnings  claimed  for  the  respective
    periods.  He said that he had not realised that his income for the  tax
    years 2010/11 and 2012/13 had not been fully accounted for to the  HMRC
    until the matter had come to light in January 2016.   He  had  informed
    the respondent that amendments had been made to the  HMRC  tax  returns
    for those two years and maintained that these amendments had  not  been
    taken into  consideration.   His  own  accountants  had  submitted  his
    amended tax returns to HMRC  and  in  letters  from  the  HMRC  it  was
    confirmed that they had received his amendments and the  appellant  had
    agreed  to  pay  the  outstanding   tax   liability   through   monthly
    instalments.  HMRC had accepted his amendments and there  had  been  no
    challenge to his explanation  that  the  error  had  been  an  innocent
    mistake.  He had instructed the new accountants as he had lost faith in
    the previous accountants, Nafiya, due to the fact that they had made  a
    mistake in submitting incorrect  figures  on  his  self-assessment  tax
    returns.  He said that he had not  checked  the  figures  submitted  by
    Nafiya Accountants to the HMRC as he had trusted  that  this  would  be
    done correctly, given that they were professional accountants.

8.   He had only become aware of the error in the figures in  January  2016.
    He explained that Nafiya had provided a letter acknowledging  that  the
    figures for 2010/11 had been incorrectly submitted due to an error made
    by a trainee,  and  the  2012/13  figures  had  also  been  incorrectly
    provided as Nafiya had failed to note that by 2012/13 the appellant had
    incorporated a private limited company and received his income  by  way
    of dividends.  This might  well  have  been  the  reason  for  Nafiya's
    failure to take into account his income in the form  of  the  dividends
    and had given his  employment  earnings  as  nil.   The  appellant  had
    explained that once he became aware of the mistake  he  took  steps  to
    rectify it.  He  had  paid  the  outstanding  tax  liabilities  and  no
    penalties had been imposed.

9.   In considering the issue of  the  appellant's  alleged  dishonesty  the
    judge had regard to the HMRC letter of 21 March 2016.  That showed that
    the appellant had not been  penalised  for  the  errors  in  submitting
    incorrect income figures.  The  judge  noted  the  letter  from  Nafiya
    Accountants  who  had  accepted  the  errors  in  submitting  incorrect
    figures.  Disclosure from the respondent showed  that  the  appellant's
    self-employed income for 2010/11 was  verified  by  the  respondent  as
    genuine.  The disclosure also showed that the supporting  evidence  had
    been provided by the appellant corroborating his  self-employed  income
    for the two years.

10.  The judge found that on balance the appellant had  not  been  complicit
    in the submission of incorrect  figures  to  HMRC.   She  accepted  the
    explanations  given  by  him  in  his  witness  statements  which  were
    consistent with his evidence  and  cross-examination  as  well  as  the
    admission of responsibility for the error by  Nafiya  Accountants  that
    the error was made by mistake by them and not a deliberate  attempt  to
    deceive by the appellant.  She noted findings of the Upper Tribunal  in
    the case of Saman (26 April 2011).  She found  that  this  was  a  case
    where the appellant was careless, as the responsibility for checking to
    ensure that the tax return submitted by his accountants  reflected  the
    correct and accurate figures ultimately rested with him.  He had relied
    on his accountants without double checking to ensure that  the  correct
    figures were submitted on his behalf.  However she did  not  find  that
    his  carelessness  in  this  regard  could  be  deemed  to   constitute
    dishonesty or intention to deceive.  She set out the  guidance  in  the
    Court of Appeal in Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673.

11.  The judge said that in the circumstances of the  appellant's  case  she
    found that having regard to his oral evidence which she had found to be
    credible together with documentary evidence referred to  above  in  her
    decision, that the evidence clearly demonstrated that  the  appellant's
    previous accountants had taken responsibility  for  the  error  in  the
    figures provided by them  in  the  tax  return  to  the  HMRC  and  the
    subsequent steps taken by them to amend and provide the correct figures
    were all factors that had not been challenged before her and  to  which
    she  attached  considerable  weight.   She  therefore  found  that  the
    appellant's submission of erroneous figures by  way  of  the  incorrect
    figures as set out in her decision were utmost careless mistakes by his
    accountants and the appellant himself.  He clearly ought to  have  been
    more diligent in ensuring the self-assessment tax return  submitted  on
    his behalf was correct and accurate in its entirety.   She  found  that
    the HMRC's letter confirming that no penalties  had  been  imposed  was
    relevant and did carry weight in showing that HMRC  did  not  find  any
    deception had been employed in the submission of the erroneous figures.
     She noted from the Home Office GCID - case record sheet that he  would
    have attracted 20 points for earnings.  She went on to conclude that on
    the totality of the evidence before her the appellant had satisfied the
    requirements of the Immigration  Rules  and  qualified  for  indefinite
    leave to remain  on  the  basis  of  ten  years  of  lawful  continuous
    residence in accordance with paragraph 276B(i)(a)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  She allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

12.  The Secretary of State sought and  was  granted  permission  to  appeal
    against the judge's decision.  Elements of the application made by  the
    respondent are problematic  in  that  they  appear  to  refer  back  to
    findings made by a judge in a previous appeal made  by  the  appellant,
    which decision was set aside  by  the  Upper  Tribunal.   Reliance  was
    placed on the decision in Samant [2017] UKAIT JR/6546/2016  and  Abbasi
    JR/13807/2016 arguing inter alia that what HMRC did or did  not  do  is
    not  necessarily relevant to actions  by  the  Secretary  of  State  in
    deciding applications for indefinite leave to remain, but even  if  the
    accountant provided evidence of responsibility  for  a  handling  error
    this did not absolve the appellant of responsibility for  his  own  tax
    affairs and  that  accordingly  the  decision  was  materially  flawed.
    Permission to appeal was granted by a Judge of the Upper Tribunal.

13.  In his submissions Mr Clarke argued that  the  challenge  was  twofold.
    First it was with regard to the judge's approach to HMRC's  failure  to
    prosecute the appellant for the difference in the  accounts  given  and
    secondly with regard to the weight attached to the accountant's  letter
    in which reliance was placed  on  what  had  been  said  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Abbasi [2020] UKUT 00027 (IAC).

14.  The issues concerned the 2011 application  and  the  2013  application.
    It could be seen that  the  real  figures  as  asserted  to  HMRC  were
    significantly different from those provided to  the  respondent.   With
    regard to what the judge  said  about  this,  it  was  clear  that  the
    appellant had had a dialogue with the previous accountants.  There  was
    a reference to one  set  of  accountants  who  had  provided  different
    figures to two different bodies.  There was no real explanation  as  to
    the �35,000 difference between the figures provided for each year.

15.  Reliance was placed on what  was  said  at  paragraphs  73  and  74  in
    Balajigari.  There it was noted that HMRC might quite properly take the
    view that if a tax return had been amended it was  content  to  collect
    the tax due and which was accepted by the tax payer was due  and  might
    or might not wish to expend the resources which would  be  required  to
    enquire into a past tax return to see whether  it  was  dishonestly  or
    carelessly made and, if necessary, defend an appeal.   Also  there  was
    nothing to prevent the applicant from drawing  attention  to  the  fact
    that HMRC had enquired into a matter and had decided not  to  impose  a
    penalty or had decided to impose  a  penalty  at  a  lower  rate  which
    signified there had been carelessness  rather  than  dishonesty.   That
    would be information which was within an applicant's own knowledge  and
    they could draw this to the attention of the Secretary of State.

16.  Mr Clarke understood from Mr Hodgetts that there was HMRC  evidence  in
    the appellant's bundle but it  did  not  confirm  there  had  been  any
    investigation by HMRC into whether the  appellant  was  dishonest.   In
    light of that it could not reasonably be  said  as  the  judge  had  at
    paragraph 18 that what had been concluded by the  HMRC  carried  weight
    because it did not find deceit in the absence of investigation.

17.  With regard to ground 2 and the approach to the  accountant's  evidence
    it was argued on behalf of the respondent that even if evidence  of  an
    error  had  been  provided  it  did  not  exempt  the  appellant   from
    responsibility.  Reference in this regard was made  to  what  had  been
    said in Shahbaz Khan [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC) in the headnote, where  it
    was said that for an applicant simply to blame his  or  her  accountant
    for an error in relation to the historical tax return would not be  the
    end of the matter given that the accountant would or should have  asked
    the taxpayer to confirm that the return was accurate and to have signed
    the tax return.  Furthermore the applicant would have known of  his  or
    her earnings and would have  expected  to  pay  tax  thereon.   If  the
    applicant did not take steps within a reasonable  time  to  remedy  the
    situation, the Secretary of State might be  entitled  to  include  that
    this failure justified a conclusion  that  there  had  been  deceit  or
    dishonesty.

18.  Clearly the appellant would have signed off on these  accounts  and  it
    was odd that the same accountants provided different assertions to  the
    Home Office and the HMRC that the appellant  would  not  have  noticed.
    This was relevant to the guidance in  Balajigari.   There  had  been  a
    wilful shutting of the eyes.  It was not a point in the grounds but  it
    was relevant to the accountant's mistake and not enough to resolve  the
    appellant from responsibility.

19.  With regard to the criticism of Khan in Balajigari at paragraph 42  and
    paragraph 44, it should be noted that both were judicial  review  cases
    and directed to the Secretary of State's decision - making capacity  as
    to  whether  there  was  dishonesty  and  that  a  suspicion  was   not
    necessarily a rational  conclusion  that  there  had  been  dishonesty.
    Those paragraphs dealt with the Secretary of State's procedure and lack
    of a procedure allowing further evidence to be put in.  This should  be
    contrasted with the position in the instant  case  of  an  appeal  with
    every opportunity to put in evidence.  The reasoning as set out in Khan
    should therefore have been taken into account.

20.  As regards the guidance in Abbasi, it was said there that  where  there
    was  reliance  on  an  accountant's  letter  admitting  fault  and  the
    submission of incorrect tax returns to HMRC, the  First-tier  or  Upper
    Tribunal was unlikely to place any material weight on  that  letter  if
    the accountant  did  not  attend  the  hearing  to  give  evidence,  by
    reference to a  statement  of  truth,  that  explained  in  detail  the
    circumstances in which the error came to be made, the basis and  nature
    of any  compensation,  and  whether  the  firm's  insurers  and/or  any
    regulatory body had been informed.  This was particularly  so  and  the
    letter was clearly perfunctory in nature.  Here there was no  complaint
    or evidence against the accountants.  It should have been clear in  the
    circumstances that there were problems with the accountant's letter.  A
    trainee was blamed but it did not explain away why they would  get  the
    figures right  when  they  were  provided  to  the  respondent.   As  a
    consequence the judge should not have attached weight to it and if  not
    it was questioned why she could find the case was not made out  by  the
    Secretary of State given the considerable discrepancy in the figures.

21.  In his submissions Mr Hodgetts argued that the challenge was  a  matter
    of disagreement only.  He relied  on  his  written  submissions  of  16
    November 2020 and 22 November 2020.  The judge had  assessed  the  oral
    evidence and that,  as  was  argued  on  the  appellant's  behalf,  was
    important.  Caution should be exercised in setting aside a decision  in
    such circumstances.  The assessment of the oral evidence was  key,  for
    example at paragraph 15.  The judge had made an overall  assessment  of
    how the appellant came  across  including  in  cross-examination.   The
    accountant's evidence had been  taken  into  account  as  corroborative
    evidence.  Reliance was also placed on  what  the  judge  had  said  at
    paragraph 18.  There was oral  and  written  evidence  which  had  been
    considered.  The matter was taken holistically and in the  round.   The
    appellant had been concluded to be careless and not dishonest.  She had
    criticised him but found the  HMRC  letter  was  relevant  and  carried
    weight but gave considerable weight to the oral evidence.  It would  be
    wrong to interfere with the judge's clear reasons.  Reliance was placed
    on the authorities cited by Mr Hodgetts.  Inappropriate weight had  not
    been placed on HMRC's position.  HMRC had  considered  culpability,  as
    could be seen in the letter at page 35 of the bundle  which  the  judge
    referred to and also at page 36 where the appellant's  culpability  was
    considered in the assessment of the penalties  and  the  reference  was
    made in submissions to various levels of culpability, so the matter had
    been considered by HMRC under the Taxes Act.  The judge was correct  to
    find as she did at paragraph 18 about the HMRC view.  It had  not  been
    assumed that there had been a full HMRC  investigation,  but  they  had
    addressed their mind to the matter and came to a view  on  culpability.
    As a consequence the judge had not placed inappropriate weight  on  the
    HMRC evidence.  It was regarded as relevant  only,  and  supported  the
    positive credibility findings the judge had already made.

22.  With regard to the authority of Samant it was  not  clear  whether  the
    case cited in the grounds was the same one cited by the  judge  but  it
    showed that HMRC's position could go one way or another but  as  argued
    above at page 36 of the bundle HMRC had  considered  culpability.   The
    appellant had been found to be credible and the judge was  entitled  to
    come to that finding.

23.  With regard to the accountant's evidence, Abbasi  did  not  set  out  a
    rule of law that written evidence from an accountant was irrelevant and
    it was not an error of law to take it into account as corroborative  of
    accepted oral evidence.  There was no explicit challenge in the grounds
    to the positive credibility finding at  paragraph  18  of  the  judge's
    decision.  It could not be said that inappropriate weight was placed on
    the accountant's evidence.  It seemed there was no  evidence  that  the
    same accountants had supported the Tier 1 application.   It  was  clear
    from paragraph 42 of Balajigari the dishonesty issue had to be  decided
    and the judge had done so.

24.  By way of reply Mr Clarke was not sure that the Saman or  Samant  cases
    were the same but it was not  material  in  any  event.   Otherwise  as
    regards the evidence of what the accountants did at the time it may  be
    there was no evidence that they were the same accountants but if not it
    would heighten suspicion.  If the two sets of figures had been sent  to
    the Home Office and  HMRC  by  different  accountants  it  begged  more
    questions.

25.  I reserved my decision.

26.  The judge came  to  clear  credibility  findings  in  this  case  as  a
    consequence  of  her  assessment  of  the  evidence.   She  found   the
    appellant's oral evidence to be credible and accepted the  explanations
    he gave in his  witness  statements  which  were  consistent  with  his
    evidence  and  cross-examination  as   well   as   the   admission   of
    responsibility for the error by Nafiya Accountants that the  error  was
    made by their mistake.  As regards the first ground,  the  judge  found
    that the HMRC letter confirming that no penalties had been imposed  was
    relevant and did carry weight in showing they had not found  deception.
    In my view that it is not inconsistent with any of the guidance in  the
    case law.  The judge was entitled to take it into account  and  it  was
    done by her in the context of having previously found  the  appellant's
    evidence to be credible and the fact that the previous accountants  had
    taken responsibility for the error.  I  agree  with  Mr  Hodgetts  that
    Abbasi does not establish a rule of law that an accountant  has  to  be
    present to give evidence in support of their admission of  fault  in  a
    case such as this.  The  accountant's  letter  was  in  any  event  not
    perfunctory but carried a sufficient explanation for the error for  the
    judge to be entitled to attach the weight to it that she  did.   It  is
    not a decision that every judge  would  have  come  to:  as  Mr  Clarke
    argued, the discrepancies are very significant ones, but the judge  had
    the evidence of the appellant before her and was entitled  to  come  to
    positive credibility findings as a consequence of her assessment of the
    appellant's evidence, supported by the accountant's letter and  bearing
    in mind the position taken by HMRC.  Accordingly I consider that it has
    not been shown that she erred in law and therefore her decision stands,
    subject to the caveat that I mentioned at the outset  of  the  hearing.
    This was that the judge allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.
     She was not entitled to do that as the  appeal  was  on  human  rights
    grounds only.  Therefore for her decision allowing the appeal under the
    Immigration Rules is substituted a decision allowing the  appeal  under
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

No anonymity direction is made.
