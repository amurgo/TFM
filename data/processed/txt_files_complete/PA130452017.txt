                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant was born in July 1989 and is from Kurdistan, Iraq. She
      married in 2006 and had a son in 2008. The marriage broke down and
      they divorced. Her son lives with her former husband in Iraq.

   2. In August 2016 she married her present husband in Iraq. He also is
      originally from Kurdistan. He came to the United Kingdom in 1999 and
      obtained British citizenship in 2005. He also had been married before
      to a Kurd and they have 2 children, V, born on 29 May 2008 and S, born
      on 28 April 2011.

   3. After his marriage to the appellant he returned to the United Kingdom
      on the 9th September 2016. He returned again to Iraq in May 2017 to
      see the appellant. He could not meet the financial threshold to
      sponsor the appellant under the immigration rules.

   4. The appellant entered the United Kingdom illegally on 31 May 2017 and
      made a claim for protection. She said she feared her family who feel
      she has brought dishonour upon the house. At the time of hearing she
      was expecting her 1st child with her 2nd husband.

   5. A claim was refused by the respondent on 27 November 2017. Judge of
      the First-tier Lodge heard her appeal on 19 January 2018 and accepted
      the appellant was in a genuine and subsisting relationship with her
      husband. However, the judge did not find she would be at any risk on
      return. The judge did not find her to be a truthful witness and
      concluded her claim was to circumvent the immigration rules for entry
      clearance as a spouse.

The Upper Tribunal

   6. Following a hearing on 23 November 2018 I found a material error of
      law in the decision in relation to the consideration of article 8.

   7. For the resumed hearing I have been provided with an appeal bundle on
      behalf of the appellant running to 220 pages. I have also received
      copies of the decisions in Lama (video recorded evidence- weight-
      article 8 ECHR )[2017] UKUT 00016 and JG (s 117B(6):" reasonable to
      leave)Turkey [2019] UKUT 72. Ms Short has helpfully provided a
      skeleton argument.

   8. I heard evidence from the appellant and her husband. She accepted that
      her asylum claim was not credible and said they had wanted to seek
      entry clearance but could not meet the requirements. She claimed her
      husband was unaware she was going to enter the country illegally. She
      adopted her statement and said that her husband's 2 children are with
      them and see their natural mother every other weekend. She said they
      are in contact with her husband's family but not her own. She said
      that Kurdish is spoken in the household.

   9. Her husband gave evidence adopted his statement. He said that his 2
      older children sometimes spend their holidays with her natural mother.
      He said they did not like to spend a long time away. He does not have
      regular contact with his first wife. He referred to his work as a taxi
      driver. He said that before the appellant arrived he can only work
      limited hours and earned in the region of �5000 per annum. This has
      gradually increased to around �10,000. He said they had considered
      applying for entry clearance at the time but did not make application.
      He claimed he did not know she was coming to the United Kingdom. He
      was asked about the possibility of the family relocating to Iraq. He
      said his family were in difficult circumstances as his father had
      suffered a stroke and his mother cared for him. He did have a sister
      who worked in a bank.

  10. In submissions, the presenting officer pointed out the appellant came
      here illegally. She made the point that she was not credible in her
      asylum claim. Beyond entering the country illegally she accepted there
      was no evidence of any criminality. Her husband had indicated he could
      not meet the financial requirements under appendix FM. She submitted
      that the appellant's relationship with the 2 elder children did not
      meet the requirements for a parental relationship. She also submitted
      that this was not a de facto parental relationship and that the
      appellant's evidence, for instance, that the school would call her
      about the children was not consistent with her limited command of
      English. She submitted the evidence about the older children's contact
      with the natural mother was inconsistent and there was no independent
      evidence as to her role in relation to the children. She submitted
      that the children had a closer relationship with their natural mother
      than was being suggested. She made the point that the appellant's
      husband cared for his 2 children before he was with the appellant and
      could now look after all 3 children. Reference was made to the public
      interest considerations in section 117 B, particularly as the
      financial requirements would not be met.

  11. Ms Short relied upon her skeleton argument. She submitted that this
      was a family unit living in the same house. She submitted it would be
      unreasonable to expect the children to leave the United Kingdom and
      that they were at an important stage in their education.

Consideration.

  12.  Some of the claims made by the appellant I can accept and other
      aspects I do not. I bear in mind that the appellant's claim for
      protection was not found to be truthful. There is an absence of
      independent evidence about aspects of the claim and it is impossible
      to know, in the absence of evidence, what is a true situation. I have
      at times had to make findings based on what I feel is most likely to
      be the situation.

  13. I find that the statement from the appellant's husband does give
      insight into the background to the claim. He came here in 2009 and
      acquired British citizenship in 2005. His 1st wife is also Kurdish and
      from Iraq. He states they lived together in Oxford and went on to have
      2 children.

  14. V was born on 29 May 2008 and so is 10 years of age. S was born on 28
      April 2011 and so is almost 8. He said there were problems in the
      marriage and at one stage his first wife took the children and
      returned to Kurdistan. He said he went there and persuaded her to
      return and give their marriage a further chance. However, in 2015 she
      left again taking the children with her. He states he followed her to
      Kurdistan and unsuccessfully attempted to persuade her to return. He
      said the then divorced in Kurdistan. He says that they agreed it would
      be in the children's best interest to return to the United Kingdom. He
      claims he returned to the United Kingdom taking the children with him
      and his 1st wife remained in Kurdistan.

  15. Thereafter, there is limited evidence about his 1st wife. It may be,
      as he suggests, he does not know or alternatively, the whole truth is
      not being told. He said that the following year his 1st wife contacted
      him and told him she was back in the United Kingdom. He states she had
      remarried in Kurdistan but believes she came to the United Kingdom
      alone. She subsequently moved to Gloucester where she remains. He
      states there were no court orders but it was agreed he would continue
      to look after the children and they would see their mother every other
      weekend.

  16. The papers referred to an incident involving the social services.
      There is limited documentary information about this but there is a
      letter at page 30 of the appellant's bundle confirming some concern.
      The appellant's husband refers to this at paragraph 13 onwards of his
      statement. The account given abuse credible and supports their natural
      mother being in the United Kingdom and that contact takes place.

  17. On balance, I would be prepared to accept that from the summer of 2016
      he was caring for his 2 children as a lone parent. I accept he was
      living in Oxford and their natural mother was living in Gloucester and
      she would see them every other weekend.

  18. He states because of his caring responsibilities he had to reduce his
      working hours as a taxi driver. Consequently, I can appreciate how he
      saw the need to remarry. He said this was not an arranged marriage but
      the background would suggest differently.

  19. At hearing it was indicated they had an awareness of the rules about
      entry clearance. To make an application presented difficulties:
      notably, the financial requirements and the English language
      requirement. It is my conclusion they mutually agreed the appellant
      would enter the United Kingdom illegally and make a fabricated claim
      for protection. It is notable that the appellant arrived in the United
      Kingdom a few days after her husband had returned. I do not accept his
      account he was unaware she was travelling over.

  20. Since she arrived in May 2017 they have been living together. Their
      relationship is genuine and subsisting. They have now been together
      for 2 years. They now have a son, Sh, born on 9 June 2018. The
      appellant has limited English but I accept she intends to learn if her
      situation is more settled. I accept her husband now has more time to
      work as a taxi driver and his income has increased albeit it is still
      below the financial threshold. Because the appellant has taken on much
      of the caring responsibilities towards the children he is able to have
      some leisure time, for instance, to go to the gym.

  21. I accept that the appellant and her husband and 3 children are living
      as a family unit in Oxford. It seems natural over the course of the 2
      years that a bond will have developed between the appellant and her
      husband's 2 children from his 1st wife. I accept the appellant's
      account of a typical day which involves her taking the children to and
      from school and spending time with them. I also accept that the 2
      elder children maintain contact with their natural mother. This
      includes visits every other weekend. The evidence would suggest their
      father does not enjoy a good relationship with her and contact between
      them is limited and confined to practical matters such as arrangements
      for visits and some financial assistance.

  22. The decision affects not only the appellant and her husband but also
      the 3 children. In considering the appeal I must have regard to
      section 55. The 2 elder children are British nationals. They speak
      English and Kurdish. The evidence indicates they have been to
      Kurdistan on 2 occasions for short periods. Their established life is
      in the United Kingdom where they have friends and attend school. It is
      in their best interests as they grow that they have a loving mother
      figure. It is important that they maintain contact with their natural
      mother. The appellant's child is an infant and it is important that he
      bond with his natural mother. In this scenario I cannot see how it
      could possibly be in the children's best interests for the family unit
      to be broken up or for the family to relocate.

  23. I am required to have regard to the public interest consideration set
      out in section 117 B. In particular section 117 B 6 is relevant. The
      appellant's child is a British national. The appellant has a genuine
      and subsisting parental relationship with him. I also accept at this
      stage the appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with the
      2 elder children. I have considered whether it would be reasonable to
      expect the children to leave and my conclusion is that it would not.
      They have the right to be here and to benefit from all that United
      Kingdom can offer. It would not be reasonable to break up the family
      unit. The 2 elder children could not relocate to Kurdistan if their
      mother is in the United Kingdom.

  24. In terms of the public interest factors the appellant has engaged in
      deception when making a fabricated claim for asylum. I also find her
      husband was complicit. However, there is no evidence of any other
      negative suitability factors. It is acknowledged that the appellant
      has limited English but I would accept when circumstances permit she
      will seek to address this. Her husband also does not meet the income
      threshold but is nevertheless in employment and is attempting to
      increase his earnings.

  25. Looking at the feature set out and primarily because of the position
      of the children it is my conclusion that the appeal must succeed on
      the basis of article 8.

Decision

The appeal is allowed under article 8
