                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This appeal comes before me following a  hearing  on  21  June  2013
       following which I decided to set aside the decision  of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal which  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  a
       refusal to issue a residence card. In fact, the appeal was  remitted
       to the Upper Tribunal by the Court of Appeal by consent.

    2. The history of the proceedings in more detail  is  set  out  in  the
       Decision and Directions which followed the hearing before me  on  21
       June 2013. That decision in full is as follows:

              DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

           1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria,  born  on  19  February
             1978. A decision was taken on 1 September  2010  to  refuse  to
             issue her with a residence card as an extended family member.

           2. Her appeal against that decision was dismissed by  Immigration
             Judge B. A. Morris after a hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal
             on 13 October 2010. Permission to appeal against  her  decision
             having been granted, the appeal next came before  Deputy  Upper
             Tribunal Judge R.C. Campbell on 28  April  2011.  He  concluded
             that there was no error of law in Judge Morris' decision.

           3. On 3 May 2013, by consent, the Court  of  Appeal  allowed  the
             appellant's appeal against the decision  of  the  Deputy  Upper
             Tribunal Judge  and  the  appeal  was  remitted  to  the  Upper
             Tribunal. Thus, the appeal came before me.

           4. The refusal to issue a residence card was on  the  basis  that
             the appellant had failed to establish the necessary  dependency
             as an extended family member.

          Submissions

           5. On behalf of the respondent before me  it  was  accepted  that
             there was an error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
             Tribunal in terms of the conclusion  at  [17]  that  dependency
             needed to be  established  in  a  country  in  which  both  the
             appellant and the sponsor lived at the same time.

           6.  Mr  Ngwuocha  contended  that  aspects  of  Judge  Campbell's
             determination could stand. As I pointed out however, the  Court
             of Appeal decided that  the  appeal  against  Judge  Campbell's
             determination was to be allowed and the matter remitted to  the
             Upper Tribunal.

           7. As to dependency, it was argued on  behalf  of  the  appellant
             that the relevant date is the date of decision and that it  was
             for the Secretary of State to ask  the  appellant  for  further
             evidence of dependency. I was referred to the decision  of  the
             Court of Appeal in Adesulu [2013] EWCA Civ  144.  A  number  of
             issues had been resolved  in  the  appellant's  favour  it  was
             suggested. The only issue left to  be  determined  is  that  of
             prior dependence or membership of the same household.

           8. In terms of whether the error of law requires the decision  to
             be set aside,  I  was  referred  by  both  parties  to  various
             domestic and European authorities, in particular on the meaning
             of "dependency". Mr Ngwuocha submitted that the  decision  does
             require setting aside, Ms Isherwood argued that it did not. She
             submitted that the evidence as to financial support, limited to
             the payment of school fees, was  not  sufficient  to  establish
             dependency and that the First-tier judge was entitled  thus  to
             find, at [17] of the determination.




          My assessment

           9. An error of law having been  identified,  the  only  remaining
             questions are whether the error of law is such as to mean  that
             the decision should be  set  aside,  and  if  so,  whether  the
             decision should be re-made in the Upper Tribunal or the  appeal
             remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

           10.Section 12(2) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
             2007 makes it clear that if the Tribunal finds that there is an
             error on a point of law made by the First-tier Tribunal,  there
             is a discretion as to whether or not the decision of the First-
             tier Tribunal should be set aside.

           11.At [17] of the First-tier Tribunal's determination  the  judge
             made a finding  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  dependency,
             finding that the sending of  money  for  school  fees  was  not
             sufficient to establish dependency. It does seem to me that the
             evidence for dependency from the appellant's witness  statement
             and in the fact of the money transfer receipts is rather sparse
             in terms of establishing dependency. However, it also seems  to
             me that a  more  detailed  enquiry  was  necessary  before  the
             conclusion was reached that  the  evidence  did  not  establish
             dependency.

           12.I also bear in mind that the issue of dependency has  received
             later clarification in the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  in
             Moneke  (EEA  -   OFMs)   Nigeria   [2011]   UKUT   00341(IAC).
             Furthermore, the history of this appeal includes  its  remittal
             from the Court of Appeal.

           13.In the circumstances, I have decided that the decision of  the
             First-tier Tribunal is to be set  aside.  Both  parties  agreed
             that in the event that I came to that view the  decision  could
             appropriately be re-made in the Upper  Tribunal,  and  I  agree
             with that view.

           14.The appeal will in the circumstances require a further hearing
             at which all aspects of dependency will need to be  considered.
             It is therefore encumbent  on  the  appellant  to  adduce  such
             further  evidence  as  she  and  her  representatives  consider
             necessary to establish both prior  and  present  dependency  or
             present membership of the sponsor's household. I do  not  agree
             with the submission made on behalf  of  the  appellant  to  the
             effect that it is for the Secretary of State to ask for further
             evidence of dependency, or incidentally, that it is the date of
             decision that is the relevant date; it is the date of  hearing.
             In considering whether or not further evidence is to be adduced
             on  the  question  of  dependency,  the   appellant   and   her
             representatives will no doubt bear in mind the  observations  I
             have made as to the extent of the evidence on that  issue  thus
             far.

           15.As I also indicated at the hearing,  there  is  presently  no
             evidence  as  to  when  the   sponsor   obtained   his   German
             citizenship. This  is  a  matter  that  must  be  addressed  by
             satisfactory evidence at the next hearing.

           16.This appeal will  therefore  be  listed  for  further  hearing
             before the Upper Tribunal and  is  subject  to  the  directions
             below.







                   DIRECTIONS

           1. Any further evidence from the appellant is to  be  filed  and
               served no later  than  14  days  before  the  next  date  of
               hearing.

           2. Evidence is required in particular as to the  date  on  which
               the sponsor obtained his German citizenship.

           3. At the resumed hearing the parties must be prepared  to  make
               submissions as to what, if any,  findings  of  fact  by  the
               First-tier Tribunal are to be preserved. Provisionally, such
               findings would appear to be limited to  the  sponsor  having
               been in the UK exercising Treaty  rights  since  April  2009
               [13], that the appellant is the cousin of the sponsor  [14],
               and that the money transfer receipts  show  that  money  was
               sent to the appellant [15].

    3. When the appeal was next listed before  me  on  24  September  2013,
       notwithstanding the directions given in the error  of  law  decision
       set out above, in particular with reference to [14] in  relation  to
       further evidence, there was no further evidence  submitted  and  the
       directions had not been complied with. A copy of what was said to be
       the sponsor's German Identity card was provided but it  was  largely
       illegible. On behalf of the  respondent  evidence  was  produced  in
       relation to whether the appellant  and  the  sponsor  were  in  fact
       living at the same address as had been claimed. The sponsor did  not
       appear at that hearing. I was told that he had gone  on  a  business
       trip.

    4. I indicated to the appellant's  then  representative,  Mr  Ngwuocha,
       that if the hearing were to proceed on that day, my provisional view
       was that the appeal would be dismissed given the lack of evidence on
       central issues, notwithstanding that I had given directions for  the
       production of further evidence and identifying the  areas  in  which
       evidence was lacking. Mr Ngwuocha then applied  for  an  adjournment
       which I granted. So it was that the appeal came before me  again  on
       27 November. I gave written directions pointing  out  that  previous
       directions had not been complied  with  and  repeating  in  emphatic
       terms the need for the appellant to adduce  sufficient  evidence  in
       relation to dependency and/or membership of household.

    5. The day before the hearing on 27 November the  Tribunal  received  a
       faxed letter from the appellant's representatives.  It  stated  that
       the representatives are  unable  to  attend  because  they  had  not
       received any instructions from the appellant.  They  were  not  sure
       whether or not she would be attending.

    6. When the case was called on  at  10.20  am  the  appellant  had  not
       appeared. There was apparently no message from her to administrative
       staff to indicate that she was for some reason unable to attend.  No
       written communication has been received from her in relation to  her
       inability to attend. The Tribunal file  shows  that  she  was  given
       notice of the hearing at the address given to the  Tribunal,  namely
       c/o of her solicitors. In any event the hearing date of 27  November
       was given at the end of the hearing on the  last  occasion.  In  the
       circumstances I decided to proceed with the hearing in  the  absence
       of the appellant having regard to rules 38 and  2  of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

    7. In a letter to  the  Tribunal  dated  26  November  2013  Mr  Hopkin
       explained  that  the  sponsor,  Mr  H.  Ehidiamhen,  had  an  appeal
       outstanding before the First-tier Tribunal against the refusal of  a
       registration certificate. The appeal is listed to be  heard  at  the
       Hatton Cross hearing centre in May 2014. According  to  the  reasons
       for refusal letter the Secretary of State was not satisfied that  he
       is exercising Treaty rights.

    8.  Mr  Hopkin's  letter  accepts  that  the   sponsor   holds   German
       nationality. At the hearing before me he went further and  conceded,
       with reference to the copy of his German passport, that the passport
       was issued on 21 May 2004.

    9. The issues before me that remained to  be  decided  therefore,  were
       whether the appellant had established prior and  present  dependency
       or present membership of the sponsor's household.

   10. I did not consider it necessary, or indeed appropriate, to delay the
       hearing of this appellant's appeal until the sponsor's own appeal in
       May 2014. The issue in his appeal appears from  the  refusal  letter
       provided to me in his case, to relate to whether  he  is  exercising
       Treaty rights. That has not been in issue in the proceedings  before
       the Upper Tribunal. In any event, I am satisfied that her appeal can
       be determined without reference to  that  matter.  Furthermore,  for
       present purposes Mr Hopkin agreed that  the  finding  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Morris at [13] that the sponsor had  been  exercising
       Treaty rights since April 2009 until the time of the hearing  before
       her on 13 October 2010 was a finding that could be preserved.

   11. The appellant's claim of entitlement to a  residence  card  is  made
       with  reference  to  Regulation  17  of  the  Immigration  (European
       Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations") on the basis
       that she is a family member of an  EEA  national  exercising  Treaty
       rights. Reg. 8 defines what is meant by an "extended family member",
       being relevant here because the  appellant  is  the  cousin  of  the
       sponsor rather than a family member (such as a spouse) as defined in
       reg. 7. Again, Judge Morris concluded at [14] that the appellant and
       the sponsor are so related and that finding  is  unaffected  by  the
       error of law in her decision. I gave  my  provisional  view  in  the
       directions sent with the error of law decision as to  what  findings
       of Judge Morris could be preserved  and  no  disagreement  has  been
       expressed by either party.  For  completeness,  the  last  preserved
       finding set out is that the money transfer receipts from the sponsor
       show that money was sent to the appellant (at [15] of the First-tier
       judge's determination)

   12. Reg. 8, so far as relevant, provides as follows:

           "Extended family member"


           8.-(1) In these Regulations "extended family member" means a
           person who is not a family member of an EEA national under
           regulation 7(1)(a), (b) or (c) and who satisfies the conditions
           in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

           (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if the
           person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse or his civil
           partner and-

           (a) the person is residing in an a country other than the United
           Kingdom and is dependent upon the EEA national or is a member of
           his household;

           (b) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a) and is
           accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom or wishes to
           join him there; or

           (c) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a), has
           joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and continues to
           be dependent upon him or to be a member of his household.


   13. Accordingly, the appellant must establish, in this  case,  that  she
       was dependent on the sponsor when she was living in Nigeria and that
       there she is still dependent on him or a member  of  his  household.
       There are a number of authorities on these issues and I was referred
       on behalf of the respondent to Moneke (EEA -  OFMs)  Nigeria  [2011]
       UKUT 00341(IAC), already noted in the error of law decision, and Lim
       (EEA-dependency) [2013] UKUT 437 (IAC) in relation to what is  meant
       by dependency. I have also considered  Dauhoo  (EEA  Regulations-reg
       (8(2)) [2012] UKUT 79 (IAC) in terms of how  a  person  is  able  to
       establish  that  they  come  within  reg  8(2).   Further,  I   have
       considered the decision of the Court of Appeal in Oboh  [2013]  EWCA
       Civ 1525 and that of the European Court of Justice in Rahman Case C-
       83/11 [2013] QB 249.

   14. As evidence of dependency the appellant  relies  on  money  transfer
       receipts, referred to in the decision of  the  First-tier  judge  at
       [15],  those  receipts  being  dated  November  and  December  2004,
       January,  February,  March  and  July  2005.  In  the  only  witness
       statement provided by the appellant she states at [2] that "Prior to
       my arrival [in the UK]  I  had  depended  on  my  cousin,  Mr  Henry
       Ehidiamhen, who is a German national for the payment  of  my  school
       fees, being an indigent  student  on  the  account  of  my  father's
       unemployment." As  indicated,  it  is  accepted  on  behalf  of  the
       respondent in these proceedings  that  at  the  time  of  the  money
       transfers the sponsor was a German national.

   15. There is no evidence that the funds remitted to the appellant by the
       sponsor were for anything other than school fees  and  as  has  been
       pointed out, that is what the witness statement says they were  used
       for. The money transfer receipts are in relatively modest sums  from
       about 20,000 Naira  to  41,000  Naira  which  at  the  time  of  the
       transfers would have amounted only to about �115 to �237. There  are
       six transfers over a period of about eight months.

   16. In Moneke it was said at [41] that "dependency is not  the  same  as
       mere receipt of some financial  assistance  from  the  sponsor"  and
       there the Tribunal referred to UKBA guidance  which  refers  to  the
       person needing the financial support in order to meet her "essential
       needs". Mr Hopkin pointed out that at the time the money was sent to
       the appellant by the sponsor the appellant was in her mid  20's  and
       there is no evidence of the nature of the 'schooling' that the  fees
       were said to relate to. He submitted that the evidence of dependency
       whilst the appellant was in Nigeria is insufficient.

   17. It was made clear in my error of law decision and in the  directions
       that followed the hearing on 24 September 2013 as to  the  need  for
       the appellant to produce sufficient evidence of past  dependency.  I
       am not satisfied that such dependency has been  established  on  the
       limited evidence that has been provided. The appellant has not given
       any further evidence on the point and there is no  evidence  at  all
       from the sponsor.

   18. In any event,  even  if  the  money  transfers  do  establish  prior
       dependency, there is little  evidence  of  the  appellant's  present
       dependency or membership of the  sponsor's  household.  Her  witness
       statement is dated 12 October 2010. In it she states  that  "I  have
       continued to receive regular cash payments from  my  cousin,  and  I
       have also continued  to  reside  as  a  member  of  his  household."
       However, there is no evidence from  the  sponsor  in  terms  of  any
       witness statement or oral evidence. He did  not  appear  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal or before me on any occasion. There  is  no  up-
       dated evidence from the appellant on  the  point  of  dependency  or
       membership of the sponsor's household.

   19. Mr Hopkin referred me  to  evidence  he  produced  at  the  previous
       hearing, namely CID printouts with reference to the sponsor and  the
       appellant which appeared to show that at least in  April  2012  they
       did not live at the same address. I indicated at the earlier hearing
       that I would consider the admission  of  any  further  evidence   by
       either party at the resumed hearing, taking into account rule 15(2A)
       of the 2008 Procedure Rules. I decided to admit that evidence. There
       is no prejudice to the appellant  who  was  aware  at  the  previous
       hearing that it was proposed to adduce it.

   20. I note that the appellant's bundle that was  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal contains payslips for the sponsor which show his address as
       the same given by the appellant in her witness  statement.  However,
       the most recent of those payslips is dated 31 January 2010  and,  as
       already  indicated,  the  appellant's  witness  statement  is  dated
       October 2010. There is no more recent evidence of  where  either  of
       them lives (apart from the CID printout to which  I  have  referred,
       but even that relates to 2012).

   21. Neither the sponsor nor the appellant attended the hearing before me
       for matters to be clarified or for up-to-date evidence of dependency
       or membership of household to be provided. Mr Hopkin submitted  that
       there was no evidence that the  appellant  was  receiving  financial
       support for her essential needs,  what  those  needs  are  and  what
       assistance she is receiving from the sponsor. He also contended that
       it would be surprising  if  the  appellant  were  dependent  on  the
       sponsor given her age and that she appears to be in good health  who
       would in ordinary circumstances be in employment. In my  view  those
       submissions have merit.

   22. I am not satisfied that the appellant has established that  she  was
       dependent on the sponsor prior to coming to the UK or  that  she  is
       presently a dependant or a member of his household. The evidence  of
       prior dependency is inadequate for the reasons  I  have  given.  The
       evidence of  present  dependency  or  membership  of  the  sponsor's
       household is similarly manifestly lacking.

   23. It follows that the appellant has not established her entitlement to
       a residence card.  No argument has  been  advanced  in  relation  to
       Article 8, neither was it advanced before the First-tier Tribunal.

   24. For the avoidance of doubt, I make it clear that my findings in this
       appeal cannot be interpreted as including a finding that the sponsor
       is presently exercising Treaty rights.  As  I  have  indicated,  the
       finding on the issue of exercise by the sponsor of Treaty rights  at
       [13] of Judge Morris' determination is a preserved finding  for  the
       purposes of this determination.  I repeat however, that it  has  not
       been necessary for me to make any  findings  on  the  issue  of  his
       exercise of Treaty rights, the appeal being able  to  be  determined
       without reference to that matter.

Decision

   25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is
       set aside and the decision re-made dismissing the appeal  under  the
       EEA Regulations.
