                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless I  shall  refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    described before the First-tier Tribunal, the Secretary of State as the
    respondent and Ms Komenan and Mr Kouame as the appellants.

 2. The appellants are citizens of the Ivory Coast born on 11 December 1970
    and 18 May 1994 and they applied for permanent residence  cards  on  30
    May 2013 as family members of an EEA national.  That was refused on the
    basis that it could not be established that Mr  Seri  Clement  Tina,  a
    Finnish national, born on 20 December 1966, could be  shown  as  having
    exercised treaty rights in the UK  for  a  continuous  period  of  five
    years.  Evidence from the EEA national sponsor showed he had been  made
    redundant in the UK in 2011 and gone back  to  Finland  for  retraining
    with a view to enhancing his employment prospects.

 3.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Raymond  allowed  the  appeals  of   both
    appellants further to Regulation 15(2) accepting that Mr  Tina  as  the
    EEA national was working for more than five years up to mid 2011 in the
    United Kingdom, from whence he went to look for work after  being  made
    redundant in February or March 2012 for training.

 4. The judge accepted two things.  First that the sponsor did not lose his
    permanent residence status from that point as  under  Regulation  15(2)
    only an absence of two years can have that result  given  he  had  only
    been out of the UK since February or March 2012.

 5. Also in paragraph 27 the judge found that the sponsor did not  have  to
    be a qualified person from mid 2011 as he was already by then a  person
    with permanent right of residence.

 6. Further, at paragraph 14, the judge recorded that the copied  P60s  and
    P45s in the appeal bundle for the appellant established that from  2002
    the sponsor Mr Tina had been working in  the  UK  and  that  from  2007
    onwards there were five P60s covering five years of employment to  2011
    and with P45s for 2005-2006 pointing to employment before 2007.

 7. An application for permission to appeal was granted on the  basis  that
    in respect of Regulation 15(2) Mr Tina left the UK in April 2012 and on
    28 August 2014 he was still in Finland due to commence  work  placement
    and did not return.  The sponsor had been out of the UK for a period in
    excess of two years and had lost his right to  permanent  residence  in
    the UK and therefore the appeal of the appellants could not succeed.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin  on
    the basis that the respondent argued that the judge wrongly applied the
    European cases of Lair and Bernini in his finding that by  studying  in
    Finland the sponsor had not lost his continuity of residence in the UK.

 9. I find there is no error of law in  the  determination.   Mr  Bandegani
    took me to the Directive 2004/58-EC to consider whether the  appellants
    had met the requirements of Regulation 15(2) independently.   The  main
    appellant had married the EU national on 15 October 2008.  It could  be
    shown that, even if it was concluded that  the  sponsor  had  lost  his
    permanent residence, he had not  done  so  by  15  October  2013.   The
    appellant's sponsor had worked for five years  to  2011  and  this  was
    found at paragraph 24 of the judge's determination.  Article  16(1)  of
    the Directive confirmed that Union citizens who had resided legally for
    a continuous period of five years should  have  a  permanent  right  of
    residence, their not subject to the condition in  chapter  3,  such  as
    sickness insurance.   Thus,  the  sponsor  had  a  permanent  right  of
    residence and did not require for him to continue economic activity  as
    per the Directive.  This is exactly  that  which  the  judge  found  at
    paragraph 25 as only an absence of two years could  have  that  result.
    As stated at 16.4 once acquired the right of permanent residence  shall
    be lost only through absence from the host Member State  for  a  period
    exceeding two consecutive years.

10. Thus, in 2013 when the appellants completed five years' residence,  the
    appellants' sponsor, Mr Tina had not lost  his  five  years'  permanent
    residence.  At that point he was not out of the UK for a period of  two
    years.   Thus  the  judge's  finding  at  paragraph  25   was   legally
    sustainable and  therefore  what  the  Secretary  of  State  stated  at
    paragraphs 11 and 12 of the permission to appeal was indeed irrelevant.
     I can accept that the judge may have erred at paragraphs 28 and  29  ,
    in his legal analysis in relation to Lair v Hanover  University  [1988]
    ECR 3161 and Bernini v Minister van Onderwijs en  Wetenschappen  [1992]
    ECR  1-1071.   The  question  was  whether  the  appellant's  residence
    continued during the period February 2012 to May 2013  and  the  answer
    can be found at Article 12(3) of the Directive which  confirms  that  a
    Union citizen's departure from the host Member State or  his/her  death
    shall not incur the loss of right of residence of his/her  children  or
    of the parent who has actual custody of the  children  irrespective  of
    the nationality if the children  reside  in  the  host  state  and  are
    enrolled at an educational establishment for the  purpose  of  studying
    there until the completion of their studies.  The judge  accepted  that
    at that  point  the  second  appellant  was,  when  the  union  citizen
    departed, under the age of 18 and in  full-time  education.   Therefore
    their residence would continue regardless of the situation at the  date
    of hearing.

11. A further point was made in that Regulation 15(2) of the EEA Regulation
    confirms a permanent right of residence on a family member  of  an  EEA
    national who is not himself an EEA national but has resided in  the  UK
    with the EEA national  in  accordance  with  these  Regulations  for  a
    continuous period of five years.  The point is that the judge found  at
    paragraph 14 that Mr Tina had been living in  the  UK  since  at  least
    2005/2006,  in  employment  [14].   Although  Mr  Tina  and  the  first
    appellant married at Enfield Registry on 13 May  2008  they  had  lived
    together as a family since 2006.  Thus the  appellants  could  claim  a
    period of five years in accordance with the Regulations as an  extended
    family member during which time they were  living  in  accordance  with
    these Regulations until the time  when  the  first  appellant  and  the
    sponsor were married.  Thereafter and until the  sponsor  left  the  UK
    which was in 2005 they had both clocked up five years in which to  base
    their permanent residence.

Notice of Decision

12. I therefore find that even if there was an error in  the  determination
    of the judge it was not a material error and the decision shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
