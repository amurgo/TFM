Representation:
For the Appellant:     Not represented
For the Respondent:    Mr. M. Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Mackenzie, promulgated on 30 March  2016,  in  which  he
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision  to
    refuse to grant leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:

         "The  application  for  permission  to  appeal  asserts  that   the
         appellant was tricked out of her money by an agent; she found a new
         college which needed 2 weeks to issue  a  CAS;  she  wrote  to  the
         respondent (19.3.15) to ask for this (the extra two  weeks)  before
         the expiry of his 60 days' grace period,  still  with  no  response
         even now; there is no sign that the F-tTJ had  any  regard  to  the
         letter of 19.3.15;  the  CAS  process  was  also  held  up  by  the
         respondent's continuing refusal to return his passport.

         There is, in fact, a reference to the letter  of  19.3.15  (8)  and
         also to Takur (sic) (common law fairness) (2011) UKUT 151 and Patel
         (revocation of sponsor licence - fairness)  (2011)  UKUT  211  (9).
         However if, as stated, the appellant applied in time for another 14
         days on the grounds that a CAS was assured at the end of that  time
         and if the process was held up by withholding her passport,  it  is
         arguable that the principles  in  those  two  cases  has  not  been
         applied."

 3. The Appellant had elected for determination of her appeal on the papers
    in the First-tier Tribunal.  She attended the hearing before  me.   She
    was not represented.  I heard submissions from the Appellant  and  from
    Mr. Kotas following which I reserved my decision.

Submissions

 4. The Appellant submitted that she believed she  would  be  granted  more
    leave as she wished to stay here legally, not illegally.  She had asked
    the Home Office for her passport in order that she could sit  an  IELTS
    test, but they had not returned it to her.  She wanted another chance.

 5.  Mr.  Kotas  submitted  that  the   judge   granting   permission   had
    misunderstood the common law fairness issue.  The  Appellant  had  been
    granted 60 days in line with the Respondent's policy.  If  it  was  the
    Appellant's case that the Home Office  should  have  granted  her  more
    time, she should have raised that  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The
    Appellant had encountered other problems while trying to obtain a  CAS,
    but she had written to the Respondent quite late on during the  60  day
    period.  Not responding to the letter of 19 March  2015  did  not  mean
    that the Respondent had acted unfairly.  The point of  the  PBS  scheme
    was so that decisions could be  made  consistently,  expeditiously  and
    fairly.  The Appellant had been given 60 days to find a new CAS in line
    with the Respondent's policy and she had been treated in the  same  way
    as other students in her position.  It was hard to see how she had been
    treated unfairly.

 6. The Appellant said that she was nervous  and  had  not  understood  the
    submissions, which I then explained to her.   She  said  that  she  had
    looked for several colleges.  The college in Nottingham said that  they
    would issue a CAS which is why she  had  written  to  the  Home  Office
    asking for more time.  She had given �2,500 to the college, but had not
    obtained a CAS.  She had not got the money back from the agent  either.
    She repeated that she wanted a  chance  to  remain  here  legally,  not
    illegally.



Error of law decision

 7. Paragraphs [8] and [9] of the decision state as follows:

         "The Appellant did not submit a CAS.  In the Ground of  Appeal  and
         Witness Statement dated 26 November 2015  the  Appellant  indicates
         that she has been unable to get a refund of the �2,500 she had paid
         to the London School of Advanced Studies.  She states that she  has
         been informed however by Cambridge Regional College  in  Nottingham
         that they will be able to sponsor her if she has leave to remain in
         the United Kingdom and that two weeks would be  required  to  allow
         the application to be processed.  Reference is  made  to  a  letter
         sent to the Respondent by the Appellant's previous solicitors dated
         19 March 2015 requesting that an extension of 30 days be granted.


         I do not find that the Respondent's decision is, as stated in  Form
         IAFT-1, not in accordance with the Immigration Rules  or  otherwise
         not in accordance  with  the  law.   The  Respondent  notified  the
         Appellant that her previous Sponsor's licence  had  been  withdrawn
         and she was given 60 days to obtain a  new  Sponsor.   I  have  had
         regard to Thakur (PBS decision - common  law  fairness)  Bangladesh
         [2011] UKUT 151 (IAC) and Patel (revocation of  sponsor  licence  -
         fairness) India [2011] UKUT 211 (IAC).  I find that  in  this  case
         there has been no unfairness on  the  part  of  the  Respondent  in
         considering the Appellant's case."


 8. The headnote to Thakur states:

         "A decision by the Secretary of State to refuse  further  leave  to
         remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant was not in  accordance
         with the law because of a failure to comply  with  the  common  law
         duty to act fairly in the decision making process when an applicant
         had not had an adequate opportunity of enrolling at another college
         following the withdrawal of his  sponsor's  licence  or  of  making
         further representations before the decision was made."


 9. The headnote to Patel states:

         "Where a sponsor licence has been revoked by the Secretary of state
         during an application for variation of leave and the  applicant  is
         both unaware of the revocation and not party to any reason why  the
         licence has been revoked, the Secretary of State should  afford  an
         applicant a reasonable  opportunity  to  vary  the  application  by
         identifying a new sponsor before the application is determined."


10. Taking into account the above caselaw, I find that there is no error of
    law in the judge's finding that there has been  no  unfairness  on  the
    part of the Respondent.  The judge has taken into account the  relevant
    caselaw regarding  the  treatment  of  applicants  in  the  Appellant's
    position and finds, as he is entitled to do, that  there  has  been  no
    unfairness.  The Appellant was granted 60 days to find a new CAS by the
    Respondent in line with her policy.  She was treated the same as  every
    other student in her position.  That she was unable to find  a  sponsor
    college within this time does  not  render  the  Respondent's  decision
    unfair.  The judge finds that the Appellant has failed to identify  how
    the decision is not in accordance with the  immigration  rules  or  the
    law, and has failed to identify that there has been any  unfairness  in
    the way that she was treated.

11. The judge does not refer to the letter in paragraph [9] when making his
    findings.  However, I do not find that this is an error of  law.   Even
    had the judge given further consideration to the  letter  of  19  March
    2015, taking into account the caselaw and the evidence before him,  his
    finding that there was no unfairness was open to him.  It  remains  the
    fact that the Appellant was treated the same as all other  students  in
    her position, and was given a reasonable and adequate period of time in
    which to find a new sponsor.

12. I have considered the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.   It  is
    claimed that the Respondent did not reply to the  letter  of  19  March
    2015, but there was no evidence before the judge to confirm when or  if
    this letter was sent.  There is a copy of an unsigned  letter  on  file
    dated 19 March 2015, but no evidence of proof of posting.  There is  no
    evidence from the Appellant's previous representatives confirming  that
    they sent this letter.  There is no evidence that,  with  this  letter,
    they  provided  any  evidence  from  Cambridge  Regional   College   in
    Nottingham corroborating the claim that they would issue the  Appellant
    with a CAS were she to be  granted  a  further  period  of  leave.   No
    evidence from Cambridge Regional College in Nottingham was provided for
    the appeal to corroborate this claim.

13. I find that there  was  insufficient  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to show that Cambridge  Regional  College  in  Nottingham  had
    promised to issue the Appellant with a  CAS  and,  more  significantly,
    there was insufficient evidence to show that this had been communicated
    to the Respondent.   Therefore,  even  if  the  judge  had  given  more
    consideration to the evidence of this letter, it would have  been  open
    to him to come to the same conclusion.

14. Further, even if the judge had made clear findings that the  letter  of
    19 March 2015 had been sent, but that the Respondent had not replied to
    it, while this might be unsatisfactory,  it  does  not  mean  that  the
    Respondent acted unfairly.  She  treated  the  Appellant  the  same  as
    everybody else in her position and, in accordance with her policy, gave
    her adequate and reasonable time to find  a  new  sponsor.   As  stated
    above, that the Appellant was unable to find a  new  college  does  not
    render the Respondent's conduct unfair.  The findings of the judge were
    open to him on the evidence before  him,  and  the  decision  does  not
    involve the making of a material error of law.

Notice of Decision

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not involve the making  of
    a material error of law and I do not set it aside.

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
