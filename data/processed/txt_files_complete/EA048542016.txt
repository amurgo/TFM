Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms M Vidal, of Counsel instructed by London Imperial
                    Immigration Service
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appeals, with permission, against a decision of Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Conrath who in a determination promulgated on 9
    November 2017 dismissed the appellant's appeal against  a  decision  of
    the Secretary of State to refuse to grant him a residence card pursuant
    to the provisions of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

2.   The appellant claimed that he was  in  a  relationship  with  a  French
    citizen who was exercising Treaty rights  here.   His  application  was
    refused because it was not accepted by the Secretary of State that  the
    sponsor was exercising Treaty rights here as  the  Secretary  of  State
    could find scant evidence that he was doing so.

3.   The appellant is a citizen of India born on 26  March  1988.   He  gave
    evidence at the hearing, as did  his  sponsor,  Mr  Benjamin  Guillaume
    Georges Jones who is also aged 29.

4.   At the hearing the judge had before him evidence that the  sponsor  had
    been employed by Baytex Limited until the end of July 2015 and that the
    sponsor had started a business in August 2015 called BJ  Entertainment.



5.   The sponsor's evidence was that he worked as a  self-employed  musician
    and as well as working with other musicians at concerts he was a writer
    and composer.  He would supplement his income by taking paid employment
    although he had last had paid employment at Christmas 2015 until  March
    2016.  He said that he had worked in self-employment, his last contract
    ending in July 2017 - that is two  months  before  the  hearing.   The
    sponsor said that he was looking for a new  contract  and  for  further
    gigs and work.

6.   He produced tax returns for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17 showing  that
    he had worked and earned �10,992 in the first year and �10,800  in  the
    second year.  The sponsor said that he  had  no  invoices  and  had  no
    business bank account and had no accountant to draft accounts for  him.
    He stated he did that himself but was not  sure  if  he  paid  national
    insurance contributions.  He stated he had not worked full-time  during
    the previous year as he had  visited  France  on  occasion  for  family
    reasons.

7.   The judge noted both the sponsor and the appellant  accepted  that  the
    sponsor was not actually working at the time of hearing,  although  the
    sponsor had maintained that he was currently  seeking  additional  gigs
    and work.  The judge, having considered the  financial  evidence  found
    that it was not established by the appellant or the  sponsor  that  the
    sponsor was a qualified person for the purposes of Regulation 6 of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  He stated that he was not required
    to reach a conclusion as  to  whether  or  not  the  appellant  was  an
    extended family member of the sponsor as the  Secretary  of  State  had
    refused the application solely on the basis that the EEA  national  was
    not exercising Treaty rights.

8.   The appellant appealed arguing that not only was he in  a  relationship
    with Mr Jones but that the judge in the First-tier Tribunal had  failed
    to consider the evidence in the round.  There was no evidence that  the
    appellant or the sponsor were not credible and that the judge had  made
    no clear finding in that regard.   It  was  argued  that  although  the
    appellant's partner was not actually working on the day of the  hearing
    it was in the nature of self-employed that it ebbed and flowed and lack
    of work on a specific day did not  mean  that  someone  was  not  self-
    employed in the wider sense.

9.   Permission to appeal was granted by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Grubb  who
    stated in his reasons:-

         "It is arguable that the judge  reached  an  irrational  conclusion
         that the sponsor was not a  'qualified  person'.   The  appellant's
         case was that the sponsor is a  self-employed  musician.   Although
         there was evidence  (from  the  appellant  and  sponsor)  that  the
         sponsor had not worked since December 2016 but had spent six months
         back in France, it does not appear that the evidence  was  that  he
         had ceased  to  be  self-employed  even  if  he  was  not  actually
         performing as a musician  up  to  the  date  of  hearing.   He  had
         supplemented his income in July 2017 with other  work  and  he  was
         'looking for a new contract,  and  looking  for  further  gigs  and
         work';  (see  para  13).   It  does  not  appear  that  the   judge
         disbelieved the appellant and sponsor.   He  had  made  no  adverse
         credibility finding.  If so this evidence was arguably evidence  of
         continued economic activity - and certainly was inconsistent  with
         him having ceased economic activity.  For these reasons  the  judge
         arguably erred in law in reaching his adverse finding.".

10.  At the hearing before me it was agreed  by  both  representatives  that
    the issue before me was the narrow issue confined to whether or not the
    judge should have found that the sponsor was exercising Treaty rights.

11.  Ms Vidal referred to the determination and stating that it appeared  to
    be the case that the judge based his decision on the  fact  that  there
    was no physical evidence before him and she pointed out that  that  was
    not what was required.  There was oral evidence relating to  the  self-
    employed work which the sponsor had undertaken and indeed which he  was
    seeking.  He was therefore engaged in economic activity.

12.  In reply Mr Clarke stated that the grounds were merely  a  disagreement
    with findings which were open to the judge - the judge  had  not  been
    satisfied that the burden of proof was discharged.  He had  to  take  a
    holistic assessment of the evidence and there was nothing  to  indicate
    that there was any evidence which he had not taken  into  account.   He
    had considered the tax returns of the sponsor and was correct to  place
    weight on the fact that there was  no  physical  evidence  of  anything
    undertaken by the sponsor after 2016.  He was entitled to place  weight
    on the fact that the sponsor was not working at the date of hearing and
    had spent time in France.

13.  I consider that there is a material error of law in  the  determination
    of the First-tier Judge - that error of law is highlighted in the grant
    of permission from Upper Tribunal  Judge  Grubb  which  I  have  quoted
    above.  It is clear that the judge did not find that the appellant  and
    the sponsor were not credible.  Their evidence was that the sponsor was
    looking for work and that his economic  activity  had  not  ceased.   I
    consider that the judge did not properly consider  that  evidence  and,
    indeed the reality is that the fact that the sponsor was not working at
    the date of hearing does not mean that he had ceased economic  activity
    and indeed there is evidence of economic activity while he had been  in
    Britain.  In all I consider that the judge reached a  conclusion  which
    was not open to him on the evidence  and  I  therefore  set  aside  his
    decision.

14.  I consider that it is appropriate that I proceed then to  consider  the
    evidence before me.  There is evidence in  a  supplementary  bundle  of
    further economic activity by the sponsor since just before the  hearing
    of the appeal and in the following months.  While it is the  case  that
    the sponsor's earnings appear meagre when  the  invoices  produced  are
    considered it was the evidence of the sponsor through  his  Counsel  at
    the hearing that he also busks to supplement his  income.   I  consider
    there is clear evidence that he is exercising  Treaty  rights  and  for
    that reason I allow the appeal.

15.  That of course is not the end of the matter.  It will be  now  for  the
    Secretary of State to reconsider the application both because there has
    been no decision on the relationship  between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor but also to consider all  relevant  financial  evidence  placed
    before her.  Detailed submissions backed up by documentary evidence and
    witness statements should therefore be submitted to  the  Secretary  of
    State.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed and the decision of the judge  in  the  First-tier  is
set aside.  I have remade  the  decision  allowing  this  appeal  under  the
Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

No anonymity direction is made.
