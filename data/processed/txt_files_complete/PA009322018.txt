Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs Young, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. Hedley-Daley, Genesis Law Associates Ltd


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The First-tier Tribunal ("FtT) Judge made an anonymity order.  As the
      appeal concerns a claim for asylum and international protection it is
      in my judgement, appropriate for an anonymity order to be made under
      Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  DK is
      granted anonymity throughout these proceedings. No report of these
      proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him.  This direction
      applies both to the appellant and to the respondent. Failure to comply
      with this direction could lead to proceedings being brought for
      contempt of court.


   2. The appellant in the appeal before me is the Secretary  of  State  for
      the Home Department and the respondent to this appeal is DK.  However,
      for ease of reference, in the course of  this  determination  I  shall
      adopt the parties' status as it was before the FtT.  I shall  in  this
      determination, refer to DK as the  appellant,  and  the  Secretary  of
      State as the respondent.


   3. The respondent appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal
      ("FtT") Judge Andrew promulgated on 17th July 2018, allowing the
      appellant's appeal.


   4. The background to the appellant's claim is set out at paragraph [5] of
      the decision of the FtT Judge.  At paragraph [6] of her decision, the
      FtT Judge refers to an Immigration Officer's report dated 9th February
      2016, in relation to documents relied upon by the appellant.  The
      appellant had relied upon a personal ID card that he claimed was
      issued by the General Directorate of Nationality, in Iraq, in April
      2014.  The appellant sought to use the ID card as evidence of his
      claim that he was born on 1st September 1998. The respondent claimed
      that the ID card relied upon was fraudulent.  The FtT Judge heard
      evidence from the appellant and her findings of fact and analysis of
      the evidence is set out at paragraphs [16] to [38] of the decision.


   5. Having heard the evidence, the FtT Judge found the appellant not to be
      a credible witness. The judge was concerned about the appellant's
      evidence as to the ID card relied upon by the appellant, and his
      explanation as to when it had been obtained. The Judge accepted that
      the appellant is an Iraqi national of Kurdish ethnicity. The Judge was
      also prepared to accept that the appellant is from Jalawla and at
      paragraph [24] of her decision, the Judge notes that it is accepted by
      the respondent that the town from which the appellant comes, is in a
      disputed area, and that he could not return there.


   6. At paragraph [25] of the decision the Judge states that because of
      inconsistencies in the evidence, she was unable to be satisfied that
      the appellant's parents are dead, or that he no longer has any contact
      with his aunt in Iraq. The Judge was also not satisfied that the
      appellant's uncle wishes to recruit him for ISIS as he claims. At
      paragraph [31] of the decision, the FtT Judge found that both the ID
      card and Nationality Certificate relied upon by the appellant, are
      documents on which no reliance can be placed.


   7. The Judge properly notes at paragraph [33] of her decision that the
      first matter she must decide is whether the appellant is able to
      obtain a new CSID.  The Judge was satisfied that it is reasonably
      likely that the appellant has family in Iraq to whom he may turn.
      However, the Judge was not satisfied that the relevant city
      registration office would be operational. The Judge relied upon a
      short newspaper article published in the 'Independent', on-line, on 12
      December 2015 to support her conclusion that Jalawla remains a ghost
      town after being recaptured from ISIS.  The Judge refers to a
      photograph that accompanies the short article, "...showing the
      devastation apparently caused in the town.".


   8. At paragraphs [35] and [36], the FtT Judge concludes as follows:


         "35. It follows from this that the appellant would not be able to
         obtain a valid CSID. Thus, he would be unable to travel to the IKR.
         In this regard I have noted paragraph 5 of the head note of AAH


         36.  Even if I was wrong about this and he was able to travel
         there, the appellant has no family in the IKR. It is unlikely he
         would be able to obtain employment for himself. He has no skills or
         qualifications. He could not work without a CSID and he is from an
         area with a marked connection with ISIL."


   9. The Judge noted, at [37], that the appellant could apply for a grant
      under the respondent's voluntary return scheme and that would give the
      appellant access to ï¿½1500. The Judge noted that "... There is nothing
      before me to show that he would have access to any other form of
      funds.". The judge concluded, at [38], that she was satisfied that
      internal relocation is unreasonable.


The appeal before me


  10. Permission to appeal was granted by FtT judge Davies on 13th August
      2018. The matter comes before me to consider whether the decision of
      FtT Judge Andrew involved the making of a material error of law, and
      if the decision is set aside, to re-make the decision.


  11. The respondent submits that the Judge found the appellant not to be a
      credible witness and found that both the ID card, and Nationality
      Certificate relied upon by the appellant are documents on which no
      reliance can be placed. Having made significant adverse credibility
      findings against the appellant and having that the appellant is likely
      to have family in Iraq to whom he may turn, it was incumbent upon the
      Judge to carefully consider whether the appellant has a CSID, or will
      be able to obtain one, reasonably soon after arrival in Iraq. The
      respondent submits that the judge failed to properly consider what if
      any support might be available from the appellant's family in Iraq.


  12. Before me, Mrs Young submits that the question for the FtT Judge was
      whether the appellant has a CSID, or will be able to obtain one,
      reasonably soon after arrival in Iraq. She submits that the Judge
      fails to address the support that would be available to the appellant
      from his family, and the steps that may be taken by them to assist him
      in obtaining the relevant documents.  The Judge fails to consider the
      financial support that is potentially available to the appellant from
      his family upon return.  Mrs Young submits that the appellant has not
      made any reasonable efforts to locate his family, and the Judge fails
      to make any adequate or rational findings as to the whereabouts of the
      appellant's family.  The respondent submits that this failure is
      material to the outcome of the appeal because the appellant's ability
      to obtain the necessary identity documents, and the financial support
      available to him, is relevant to the question of whether the appellant
      could return to the IKR.


  13. In reply, Mr Medley-Daley submits that it was open to the Judge to
      find that the City Registration Office in Jalawla would not be
      operational.  He submits that the appellant does not have the
      necessary documents that would enable him to travel to the IKR, and
      internally relocate. He submits that the appellant would be unable to
      travel to Erbil without a CSID and the test is whether it is
      reasonably likely that the appellant could get a CSID either in the UK
      or upon arrival in Baghdad.


Discussion


  14. As Brooke LJ observed in the course of his decision in R (Iran) v  The
      Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  982,
      "unjustified complaints" as to an alleged  failure  to  give  adequate
      reasons are all too frequent.  The obligation on a Tribunal is to give
      reasons in sufficient detail to  show  the  principles  on  which  the
      Tribunal has acted and the reasons that  have  led  to  the  decision.
      Such reasons need not be elaborate, and do not need to  address  every
      argument or every factor which weighed in the decision.  If a Tribunal
      has not expressly addressed an argument, but if there are  grounds  on
      which the argument could properly have been  rejected,  it  should  be
      assumed that the Tribunal acted on such  grounds.   It  is  sufficient
      that the critical reasons to the decision are recorded.


  15. In AAH, the Upper Tribunal replaced section E of the Country Guidance
      annexed to the Court of Appeal's decision in AA.  The Upper Tribunal
      confirmed that whilst it remains possible for an Iraqi national
      returnee to obtain a new CSID whether the individual is able to do so,
      or do so within a reasonable time frame, will depend on the individual
      circumstances. The Tribunal set out the relevant factors, including
      inter alia whether the individual has any other form of documentation,
      or information about the location of his entry in the civil register,
      and the location of the relevant civil registry office and whether it
      is operational.


  16. The Country guidance confirms that even a Kurd who does not originate
      from the IKR may enter the IKR lawfully for up to 10 days, and then
      extend his stay to settle there, having found employment.  There is a
      need to consider wider issues such as travel between Baghdad and the
      IKR, the documents that will be available to an individual, whether
      the individual will be at particular risk of ill treatment during the
      security screening process, and the options available for
      accommodation and employment.


  17. In my judgement, the FtT Judge has failed to consider whether the
      appellant's family, who the Judge appears to find are still in Iraq,
      would be able to assist the appellant obtain replacements of the
      appellant's CSID or other documentation.  At paragraphs [34] and [35]
      of the decision, the FtT Judge fails to adequately consider whether
      the appellant is able to obtain a new CSID, or do so within a
      reasonable time frame, and whether support could be available from the
      appellant's family, in light of the finding that the appellant is
      likely to have family in Iraq to whom he may turn.  The Judge fails to
      undertake the very careful fact sensitive analysis of relevant
      factors, that is required to enable a reader of the decision to
      understand the basis upon which the Judge reached her decision,
      correctly applying the relevant country guidance.


  18. It follows that in my judgment, the decision of the FtT Judge is
      infected by a material error of law and must be set aside.  As to the
      disposal of the appeal, both Mrs Young and Mr Medley-Daley submit that
      the appropriate course is for the matter to be remitted to the FtT for
      hearing afresh. I have decided that it is appropriate to remit this
      appeal back to the First-tier Tribunal, having considered paragraph
      7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statement of 25th September
      2012.  In my view, in determining the appeal, the nature and extent of
      any judicial fact-finding necessary will be extensive. The parties
      will be advised of the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing in due
      course.


  19. It is however appropriate to preserve the findings of FtT Jude Andrew
      that:


          a. The appellant is a national of Iraq and of Kurdish ethnicity.


          b. The appellant is from Jalawla, a city in the disputed area.


          c. The appellant has family in Iraq.


Notice of Decision


  20. The appeal is allowed and the appeal is remitted the FtT for a fresh
      hearing of the appeal with the findings that I have set out at
      paragraph [19] above, preserved.


  21. I have made an anonymity direction.
