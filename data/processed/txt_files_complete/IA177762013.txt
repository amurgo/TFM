For the Appellant:     Ms E Greenwood (counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker (Home office presenting officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
                          following resumed hearing


   1.   I refer to my directions and decision dated  21.2.2014  in  which  I
      found an error of law in the decision made by First Tier Judge Walters
      in  dealing  with  Article  8  and  consideration  of  "insurmountable
      obstacles" to family life outside of the UK under App FM  EX1(b).  The
      undisputed background facts set out in the First tier determination at
      [39] were preserved together with the findings  that  the  application
      for  Personal  Independent   Payment  (PIP)  by  Gordon  Cornell   was
      outstanding, and that the appellant had lived for the majority of  her
      life in Philippines where she had family ties including her 5 year old
      daughter.


   2.  At  the  resumed  hearing  I  heard  evidence  from  three  witnesses
      including the appellant, her husband  Gary  Cornell  and  his  brother
      Gordon Cornell.  I found the witnesses to  be  entirely  credible  and
      they gave consistent evidence as to the material  issues.  Documentary
      evidence was adduced in the form of a contract of employment for  Gary
      Cornell , a medical note and prescription for Gordon Cornell.

   3.  The details of the evidence and submissions are set out in the record
      of proceedings  which  I  have  taken  into  account  in  reaching  my
      decision.

   4.  I have referred to Sabir( AppendixFM - EX.1 not free  standing)[2014]
      UKUT  00063(IAC),  Gulshan  (Article  8  -   new   rules   -   correct
      approach)[2013] UKUT 000640 (IAC, MF(Nigeria) and Nagre.   The  latter
      make clear that Article 8 is incorporated into the rules as a complete
      code as reiterated in Sabir.

   5.  I find that the appellant is in a genuine and subsisting relationship
      with Gary who is a British citizen. I find that the appellant met  all
      the requirements of the Rules save for the financial  requirements.  I
      find that she is now unemployed and that Gary is in employment earning
       an income of �17,000, close to the threshold of �18,600.

   6.  I find that the appellant lives in  a  3  bedroomed  house  with  her
      husband , his brother Gordon and their elderly father aged  86  years,
      who has some age related health  issues  including  forgetfulness  and
      deafness. I find that he is  prescribed  Warfarin  to  regularise  his
      heart and blood. Although there was no medical evidence before me I am
      satisfied that Gordon suffers from glaucoma, severe diabetes, deafness
      in both ears , a restriction of height  4'4"  (which  impacts  on  his
      daily living and mobility) and spinal curvature which leads to pain in
      his legs and back for which he requires physiotherapy.   The  evidence
      was that his application for a PIP was unsuccessful but  that  he  had
      made a fresh application, based on his increasing needs as a result of
      disability, which remains outstanding.   Notwithstanding  that  Gordon
      has not to date been awarded disability benefit, I  nevertheless  find
      that  he  has  significant  care  needs  including  washing/showering,
      dressing of lower garments, cooking,  shopping,  mobilising  and  help
      with medication. The appellant is providing the bulk of that care  for
      which she is not paid.  Her partner is working on shifts and  supports
      the care for Gordon when not working.  I find that  Gary  assists  his
      brother in managing his diabetes  and  keeping  it  under  control  by
      regular testing. Gordon is otherwise able to administer  his  insulin,
      although I find that he has suffered  from  occasional  "hypos"  which
      would place him in danger.  This places their  relationship  over  and
      above the normal family ties. I find that Gordon is able  to  mobilise
      for  short  distances  only  when  unaccompanied  but  has  fallen  on
      occasions. I find  that  he  walks  with  an  unsteady  gait  and  has
      restriction of movement because of his height.

   7.  I find that there is family life as between  the  appellant  and  her
      husband and as between the appellant, Gary and his brother and father.
      In the event that the appellant were to be returned to  Philippines  I
      find that there would in the long and  short  term  be  insurmountable
      obstacles for the family members in  particular,  Gordon  Cornell.   I
      find that the family life between the  appellant  and  Gary  would  be
      permanently ruptured.  Gary could not travel to Philippines as he  has
      to care for his brother and father, which I accept. I find that if the
      appellant were not able to provide care that Gary alone would  not  be
      able to provide adequate care in the long term and would  be  required
      to leave his employment.  I heard credible evidence that other  family
      members were unable or unwilling to provide the required level of help
      and support for Gordon. I  find  that  even  in  the  event  that  the
      appellant received a carer's allowance for looking after  Gordon  both
      she and her husband would be able to provide full care for Gordon  and
      his father with careful organisation of working  shift  patterns.  The
      evidence given by the witnesses established that the  daily  needs  of
      Gordon Cornell necessitated the care of the appellant and (to a lesser
      extent) her partner Gary, in the long term. Indeed it was conceded  by
      Mr Walker that the removal of the appellant would amount to  a  breach
      of the family life in the long term.

   8.    The  respondent's  guidance  (Section  FM  1.0  October  2013   IDI
      ("partner and ECHR Article 8 guidance") states that where an applicant
      fails to meet the  immigration  rules  requirements  for  finance  and
      English  language,  the  SSHD  must  go  on  to  consider   EX.1,   if
      applicable.  It is accepted that Ex.1 is applicable in  this  instance
      as the appellant meets EX1(b).  Mr Walker conceded that  in  the  long
      term there would be unjustifiably harsh consequences  for  the  family
      and private lives.

   9. As to the short term implications of the appellant being  required  to
      make an out of country application for entry clearance,  I  find  that
      there would remain insurmountable  obstacles  and  a  significant  and
      unjustified and high degree of hardship  to  the  private  and  family
      lives.  Insurmountable  obstacles   are   concerned   with   practical
      possibilities of relocation. (Gulshan [24(c)]) I am persuaded that  no
      legitimate purpose is met that would justify the public interest in  a
      return to make an out if country application. EX  1  applies  and  the
      appellant has met the Rules.  I conclude that a removal for  the  sole
      purpose of making an application out side of  the  country  cannot  be
      proportionate. There is no  clear  indication  as  to  how  long  such
      applications would take and the same obstacles apply in the short  and
      long term.

  10. In summary I find that (a) The  appellant's  presence  in  the  UK  is
      necessary in the short and long term for the  care  of  her  partner's
      brother and to a lesser extent his father.

      (b) There would be insurmountable obstacles for Gary Cornell  to  live
      in the Philippines with the appellant because there would be  no  care
      available for his family who are dependent on him over and  above  the
      normal family ties.


      (c) There would be a breach of family  life  in  the  event  that  the
      appellant returned to the Philippines in the long term as  Gary  would
      not join her there and their family life would be terminated.


  11. Alternatively, I consider  the  Guidance  in  paragraph  3.2.8  (cited
      above) and Gulshan [25(b)] There are good grounds for  granting  leave
      outside of the Rules by reference to Article 8  ECHR  and  I  conclude
      that the factors summarised above amount to exceptional  circumstances
      for the family who would suffer from unjustifiably harsh  consequences
      such that the refusal is disproportionate.


 Decision

   12.   I remake the decision by allowing the appeal under the  immigration
rules and on        human rights grounds.
