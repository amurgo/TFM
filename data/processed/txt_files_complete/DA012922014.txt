Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms M Rhind, IR Immigration Law LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent is a citizen of Nigeria and his  date  of  birth  is  27
    June 1985.  I will refer to the respondent as the appellant as  he  was
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

2.   The Secretary  of  State  made  a  decision  to  deport  the  appellant
    pursuant to Section 35A of the Immigration Act 1971 on  23  June  2014.
    The appellant appealed against this decision and his appeal was allowed
    by the First-tier Tribunal comprising a panel comprising Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Monro and Mr G H Getlevog.  The panel  allowed  the
    appellant's appeal under Article 8.  The Secretary of State was granted
    permission to appeal against this decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Pirotta in a decision of 13 February 2015.

3.   The appellant came to the UK in 1995 with his  family  when  he  was  a
    child for a holiday and he returned in 1998.  He returned to the UK  in
    1999 having been granted a visit visa and he has remained  since  then.
    He has been an overstayer since his visa expired in 2000.

4.   The appellant has  a  criminal  history.   On  4  August  2004  he  was
    convicted of possession of a bladed article and he was sentenced to two
    months' imprisonment.  On 30 September 2004 he was convicted of failing
    to surrender to custody and he was fined ï¿½25 and ordered to  serve  one
    day in prison.  On 19 November 2004 he was convicted of two  counts  of
    robbery  and  sentenced  to  three  years'  imprisonment  (the  trigger
    offence).  On 23 May 2006 he made an application to  remain  under  the
    Human Rights Act and on 23 June 2014 the appellant was served with  the
    deportation order.

5.   The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from the appellant, his  brother
    B and their sister, J (aged 17).  The appellant pleaded guilty  to  the
    robberies and his evidence was that he regretted his  involvement  with
    the offences.  Whilst he was in prison he worked  in  the  kitchen  and
    took some courses, but he was not required to take any victim awareness
    courses.  He was detained for nineteen months and he  was  released  on
    licence in December 2005 with a requirement that  he  reported  to  his
    probation officer which is did.

6.   Since his release he has not been in trouble with  the  police.   After
    his release from prison he lived  in  hostels  for  a  while  and  then
    returned to live with his  mother  and  siblings.   Shortly  after  his
    release from prison his mother was diagnosed with breast  cancer.   She
    recovered from this, but then she was later diagnosed with bone  cancer
    and passed away in January 2012.  The appellant's  sister  J  was  only
    aged 14 at the time.  The Social  Services  became  involved  and  they
    wanted the family (the appellant and his siblings) to stay together  as
    a unit.  They found a place for the three  of  them  to  live  and  the
    appellant and his brother took responsibility for J. The evidence  from
    the appellant and his siblings was that  they  have  always  been  very
    close and that the Social Services decided,  following  their  mother's
    death, that it would be in J's best interests to be looked after by her
    brothers and to remain together as a family unit. J, according  to  the
    appellant, looked upon him as a father figure.  She depends on both her
    brothers for everything.  J was  studying  for  A'  levels  and  B  had
    started a university course, but he  was  not  able  to  complete  this
    because of their mother's illness.  The appellant's evidence  was  that
    after he came out of prison he worked  so  that  he  could  assist  his
    mother.  He did some building and painting and decorating.

7.   The appellant was aged 19 when he went to prison  and  before  then  he
    had had no reason to question his immigration status.   He  thought  he
    was a British citizen because his mother had dealt with these kinds  of
    things.  It was not until he was released from prison that he  realised
    that he was not a  British  citizen  and  that  he  was  in  fact  here
    unlawfully. The appellant's mother and siblings were granted  leave  to
    remain in 2009 and their visas were extended in 2012.   At  this  point
    the  appellant  had  still  not  received  a  decision  following   his
    application in 2006.  The appellant's evidence was that he was close to
    his siblings and that they have no family in the UK or Nigeria.

8.   The Tribunal also heard evidence from B's partner,  who  was  expecting
    their first child in May 2015.  She has four children from  a  previous
    relationship.  There  were  letters  from  others  in  support  of  the
    appellant's  case  including  from  a  senior  social  worker,   Maggie
    Allingham-Hodge  at  St  Joseph's  Hospice.   She  had  supported   the
    appellant and his family for a year after their mother's death.  In her
    second letter she stated that should the appellant be deported it would
    have a very negative effect on the remaining siblings as it  was  their
    mother's intention that they should stay together.

9.   There was a letter from Janet Vandi, J's social  worker,  who  confirms
    that it was assessed to be in J's best interests for her to  be  looked
    after by her siblings and that the family was  coping  well  under  the
    circumstances but remained anxious about  the  appellant's  immigration
    situation.

The Findings of the First-tier Tribunal

10.  The panel found that the appellant had  spent  most  of  his  formative
    years here and that it was not in issue that he had studied and  worked
    here.  They found that he was socially and  culturally  integrated  and
    that he has no family in Nigeria.  They found that he has established a
    significant private life in  the  total  of  nineteen  years  over  two
    periods during which he has been living in the UK and they  found  that
    it was not in dispute that he  was  raised  by  two  parents  with  his
    brother [and] sister until 2003 when their father left the  family  and
    they found themselves in difficult circumstances.  The  panel  observed
    that for the next two years [he] went off the rails.

11.  The panel found that there was family life between  the  appellant  and
    J, who was at that time still a minor in  the  Ghising  sense  (Ghising
    (family life - adults - Gurkha policy)  Nepal  [2012]  UKUT  160).  The
    panel found that she was still a minor and looked to her older brothers
    for emotional support and that this was recognised by  Social  Services
    following their mother's death.

12.  The Tribunal took into account that B's  partner  was  expecting.   The
    panel observed that the appellant was released from prison in  December
    2005 and since then there has been no allegation that he has  committed
    any further offences and that his  clean  record  since  2004  supports
    their view that the offences were a "blip", albeit serious, and that he
    had matured and moved away from criminal behaviour.

13.  The panel found that although he had overstayed, the  appellant  was  a
    child at the time and cannot be held responsible for the actions of his
    parents, who  brought  him  here  and  remained  without  leave.   They
    accepted the appellant's evidence that he did not discover  until  much
    later that he had no right to remain here.  The Tribunal found at  [50]
    that there are exceptional circumstances such that  they  outweigh  the
    public interest in deportation.

14.  At [55] they stated that they had had regard  to  Section  117  of  the
    2002 Act and noted that the  appellant  had  not  always  been  in  the
    country lawfully, but since 2006 he had been attempting to rectify  the
    situation, he speaks English and that he  is  capable  of  working  and
    indeed has worked and could remain financially independent.

The Grounds Seeking Permission

15.  The grounds seeking permission are  twofold.   First,  it  is  asserted
    that the  panel  misdirected  themselves  in  relation  to  exceptional
    circumstances and, secondly that they did not properly weigh  into  the
    balance the  public  interest  and  failed  to  follow  the  principles
    expressed in relevant jurisprudence including AJ (Angola)  [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 1636. Mr Jarvis asked that I rely on his  oral  submissions  rather
    than the grounds.  He also sought permission to amend  the  grounds  to
    include the fact that the  panel  had  not  considered  the  precarious
    nature of the appellant's siblings' status here. There was no objection
    to this by Ms Rhind, but she sought time to clarify matters. I gave her
    time and granted the application to amend the grounds. She was able  to
    confirm to me that the siblings had been  granted  discretionary  leave
    since the date of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal. Mr Jarvis
    further submitted  that  the  panel  erred  in  applying  the  test  of
    exceptional circumstances whereas the applicable  test  was  compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in paragraph 399 and 399A.
     This was not raised in the grounds.

Conclusions

16.  The grounds are unimpressive and Mr Jarvis distanced himself from  them
    effectively relying on grounds not previously raised. The  position  of
    the respondent was far from satisfactory.

17.  The  Tribunal  clearly  attached  significant  weight  to  family  life
    between the appellant and his adult siblings.  It was  clear  from  the
    decision that their status in the UK was precarious and indeed it still
    is.  However,  this  must  be  placed  in  context   of   the   unusual
    circumstances.

18.  The appellant has been  here  continuously  for  a  period  of  sixteen
    years.  Prior to that he was here for two.  In total he has resided  in
    the UK for eighteen years.  It is without doubt that he cannot meet the
    requirements of paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules because he  has
    not been here lawfully.   However,  this  must  be  considered  in  the
    context of the fact that he has been here since he was a child  and  he
    is not responsible for the failure to regularise his stay.  Whilst  the
    evidence before the panel did not establish that there are  significant
    obstacles to integration into Nigeria, it is obvious on the findings of
    the panel that it would be very difficult for him to return to Nigeria.
     Contrary to Mr Jarvis' submissions, in my view, the panel was entitled
    to conclude that the appellant is socially and culturally integrated in
    the UK. He has been here since he was a child,  he  has  been  educated
    here and he has worked here.  He thought he was a British  citizen  and
    this was a reasonable assumption for him to make.  He has no family  in
    Nigeria.  There are no language problems and he has shown  that  he  is
    able to be financially independent.  I accept that  mere  presence  may
    not be sufficient to establish social and cultural  integration  and  I
    take into account the  appellant's  criminality  and  prison  sentence.
    However,  in  the  appellant's  case  his  evidence  goes  beyond  mere
    presence. However, by  any  account,  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of 399 or 399A of the Immigration Rules.

19.  The panel went on to consider exceptional circumstances in the  context
    of 398.  It is a fact that the wording of 398 had in  fact  changed  by
    the time of the hearing and the panel should have considered whether or
    not there are compelling circumstances over and above  those  described
    in paragraphs 399 and 399A.   This was an issue raised by Mr Jarvis  in
    oral submissions, but it was not raised in the grounds of appeal, which
    in fact repeatedly  refer  to  exceptional  circumstances.   I  am  not
    persuaded that this is a material error in any event.

20.  The appeal has to be considered through  the  lens  of  the  Rules  and
    Section 117B and 117C of the 2002 Act  and  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Tribunal  did  this.  The  properly  directed  themselves  on  relevant
    jurisprudence and legislation and clearly had  regard  to  the  factors
    raised in Section 117 generally. The maintenance of immigration control
    is in the public interest and the deportation of foreign  criminals  is
    in the public  interest  and  I  am  satisfied  having  considered  the
    decision as a whole that the panel had this in mind.  The appellant  is
    a foreign criminal.  On any account the offences that he committed  are
    serious and the  more  serious  the  greater  the  public  interest  in
    deportation. The public  interest  is  a  weighty  factor  against  the
    appellant.  Although there is no risk of him reoffending there are  the
    deterrence and the public  revulsion  factors  to  take  into  account.
    However, in this case there was no  presentence  report  or  sentencing
    comments before the panel.  The panel was entitled to conclude that the
    offences were at the lower end of the seriousness  scale.  Delay  is  a
    weighty factor here in the appellant's favour regardless of whether  or
    not the Secretary of State is directly to blame or not.  There has been
    a lengthy period of time during which the appellant has  remained  here
    since his release from prison during which he has not been convicted of
    further offences and the panel  was  entitled  to  consider  that  this
    reduced the weight to be accorded to the public interest.

21.  The appellant's case here rests on his  private  life  and  his  family
    life and it has been formed here  when  the  appellant  has  been  here
    unlawfully.  I take into account  that  primary  legislation  instructs
    that little weight should be given  to  private  life  formed  when  an
    appellant has been here unlawfully.  However, in this  case  there  are
    unusual features of the case. The obvious unusual feature is  that  the
    appellant was not responsible for his unlawful status here.  There  are
    also unusual  features  of  the  appellant's  family  life.  There  was
    unchallenged evidence of the need for family  unity  between  siblings.
    There is clearly an argument that they  could  all  return  to  Nigeria
    together in the light of the precariousness of J and B's  status  here.
    This was not considered by the Tribunal; however, it does not appear to
    have been advanced by the respondent at the First-tier  Tribunal.   The
    failure of the panel to consider this does not amount to  an  error  of
    law.  J was a child at the time of the hearing. The panel  adopted  the
    findings of the Social Services that it would be in her best  interests
    to be looked after by her brothers and there was indeed no challenge to
    this.  Clearly J has been here for a considerable period of  time  and,
    like the appellant and B, cannot be  blamed  for  the  actions  of  her
    parents.  The evidence that it would be in her best interests to remain
    here in the UK with both of her  siblings  was  strong.   Although  the
    panel did not make a clear finding about  this  it  is  something  that
    would only have weighed in the balance in favour of the  appellant.  Mr
    Jarvis  readily  accepted  that  the  family  history  was  an  unusual
    circumstance of the case.  The panel was entitled to attach  weight  to
    the appellant's family and private life here.

22.  Whilst the Tribunal should have assessed compelling circumstances  over
    and above those described in paragraphs 399  and  399A  as  opposed  to
    exceptional circumstances, in my view it is not material.   There  are,
    as  identified  by  the  panel  exceptional  circumstances  or  unusual
    circumstances, which amount to compelling circumstances over  an  above
    those described in 399 and 399A. It is of significance that  Mr  Jarvis
    indicated that it was the process of the decision  making  rather  than
    the ultimate conclusion that was the subject of the appeal.  Ultimately
    the panel reached a conclusion that it was entitled  to  reach  on  the
    evidence and the grounds and Mr Jarvis's submissions  do  not  disclose
    material error in the decision.   Indeed,  if  I  were  to  remake  the
    decision I would reach the same conclusion.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is maintained and the appeal of  the
Secretary of State is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
