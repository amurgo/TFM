                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  appeals  with  permission  against  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert, sitting at Taylor House,
    who allowed the claimant's appeal against a refusal to grant her  entry
    clearance on an application for settlement based  on  her  marriage  to
    Rahib Siddiq a United Kingdom citizen, the sponsor in this appeal.

 2. The couple have a son, born to the claimant in Pakistan, who is said at
    the date of application to be 5 months old. No  birth  certificate  for
    this child appears in the documents before me.

 3. The claimant explains that 'since marriage, [the sponsor] has  come  to
    Pakistan four times, stayed with me 4 months each time'.   The  sponsor
    is described as working for Alpha Security Solutions Limited  ('Alpha')
    in the United Kingdom.  That is said to be his only source of income.

    Immigration Rules - sponsor's income

 4. The relevant Immigration Rules in Appendix FM-SE as they stood  at  the
    date of decision required the claimant  to  produce,  on  the  date  of
    application, payslips covering a period of 6 months, showing, pro rata,
    the minimum  income  level  of  �18600  per  annum.   The  evidence  of
    financial requirements, where the sponsor is in salaried employment but
    not a director or shareholder of a limited company based in the  United
    Kingdom, must include:

         "2.  In respect of salaried employment in the United  Kingdom...all
         of the following evidence must be provided:

          a) Payslips covering:
               i) a period of 6 months prior to the date of  application  if
                  the person has been employed by their current employer for
                  at least 6 months  (and  where  paragraph  13(b)  of  this
                  Appendix does not apply); or
              ii) any period of salaried employment  in  the  period  of  12
                  months prior to the date of application if the person  has
                  been employed by their current employer for  less  than  6
                  months (or at least 6 months but the person does not  rely
                  on paragraph 13(a) of this Appendix), or in the  financial
                  years  relied  upon  by  a  self-employed  person  ...   "
                           [Emphasis added]

    For clarity, I shall refer in this decision to the  rule  at  paragraph
    2(a)(i) as the 6-month rule, and that at paragraph 2(a)(ii) as the  12-
    month rule.

 5. At paragraph 13 of Appendix FM-SE, as it then stood, the calculation of
    gross annual income under Appendix FM was to be approached thus:

         "13.  Based  on  evidence  that  meets  the  requirements  of  this
             Appendix, and can be taken into account with reference to  the
             applicable provisions of  Appendix  FM,  gross  annual  income
             under  paragraphs  E-ECP.3.1,  E-LTRP.3.1,  E-ECC.2.1  and  E-
             LTRP.2.1 will be calculated in the following ways:

             (a)  Where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at
                  the date  of  application,  has  been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for at least 6 months and has  been  paid
                  throughout the period of 6 months prior  to  the  date  of
                  application at a level of gross annual salary which equals
                  or exceeds the level relied upon  in  paragraph  13(a)(i),
                  their gross annual income will be  where  paragraph  13(b)
                  does not apply the total of:

                  (i)  the level of gross annual salary relied upon  in  the
                      application;
                  (ii) the gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                      income other than pension income received by them  or
                      their partner in the 12-months prior to the  date  of
                      application; and
                  (iii)    the gross annual income  from  a  UK  or  foreign
                      state pension or a private pension received  by  them
                      or their partner.

             (b)  Where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at
                  the date of application and has  been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for less than 6  months  or  at  least  6
                  months but the person does not  rely  on  paragraph  13(a)
                  their gross annual income will be the total of:

                  (i)  the gross annual salary from employment as it was  at
                      the date of application;
                  (ii) the gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                      income other than pension income received by them  or
                      their partner in the 12-months prior to the  date  of
                      application; and
                  (iii)    the gross annual income  from  a  UK  or  foreign
                      state pension or a private pension received  by  them
                      or their partner.


                  In addition, the requirements  of  paragraph  15  must  be
                      met."

    Evidence before the Entry Clearance Officer

 6. The claimant's application for entry clearance was  made  on  27  April
    2015.  That is the date  on  which  the  supporting  evidence  must  be
    assessed.  The claimant produced their marriage  certificate  dated  26
    January 2012, the marriage having  been  celebrated  in  Pakistan.  The
    couple's child, born at the end of 2014, is now about 3 years old.

 7. A sponsorship declaration of 10 April 2015 states that the sponsor  has
    sufficient accommodation available at his parents' home for himself and
    the claimant, and that he earns �24,000 plus commission  and  benefits,
    working as a Business Development Manager for Alpha.

 8. The sponsor produced a copy of his terms and conditions  of  employment
    with Alpha, showing an incorrect  registered  address.   The  contract,
    dated 26 May 2014, stated that the sponsor  would  be  employed  for  3
    years, and would receive commission plus benefits.  The annual  package
    is stated to be �24,000 paid monthly in arrears, plus overtime.   There
    would be an annual salary review, in March of each  year,  which  would
    not necessarily result in an increase in salary.

 9. A letter, with the same date of 26 May 2014, states that the  sponsor's
    employment runs from September 2014, that his annual package was �24000
    plus commission and benefits, and that the sponsor is 'punctual,  trust
    worthy and hardworking', which is high praise for a new employee  whose
    employment has not yet begun.

10. The sponsor's payslip evidence showed that he worked for Alpha  in  the
    tax year 2014/2015, and that in that year, he  earned  �15,310.15  from
    Alpha and a further �1,097.94  from  Xpress  Supersave  Ltd  ('Xpress')
    which appears to be a grocery store), making a total income of �15,462.



11. The income evidence for the tax year 2015/2016, from 5 April 2015 to  4
    April 2016, is that Alpha paid no money at all to  the  sponsor  during
    that tax year.  It is the sponsor's evidence that  he  established  his
    own company and that from 1 May 2015 he was self-employed.

12. There is no evidence at all to suggest that the claimant herself  works
    or has an income, or any prospect of one in the United  Kingdom.  There
    was no evidence of savings.

13. The sponsor has supplied post-decision  documents  concerning  his  new
    company, which began trading after the date of application.

    Document Verification Report (DVR)

14. On 31 July 2015, the Entry Clearance Officer sent to  the  Verification
    Plus Team of the  Home  Office  a  request  for  checks  regarding  the
    financial information in the claimant's application. The  DVR  sent  in
    reply to that enquiry noted that:

  .      in 2012/2013, there were no earnings declared to HMRC;

  .      in 2013/2014, the applicant earned  a  total  of  �7348.91,  being
    �548.92 from Xpress and �6800 from The Protectors Security Cons;

  .       in 2014/2015, he earned a total of �16,559,  being  �15,310  from
    Alpha Security Solutions Limited, paid monthly, with the  last  payslip
    of �0 on 24 April 2015, plus an additional �152 which was paid by Alpha
    for employment between 7 April 2011 and 27 August 2014; and  a  further
    �1097.94 from Xpress; and

  .      In 2015/2016, the  sponsor  earned  a  total  of  �2370.23,  being
    �812.25 from Regency Security Services (UK) Ltd, which started  trading
    on 11 May 2015 and continued to be in business;  nothing  at  all  from
    Alpha, and �13,512 from Forsec Facilities Services Limited, which began
    to trade on 6 April 2015.

    The DVR assessed the sponsor's earnings as 'not as claimed'.

    Refusal letter

15. On 15 September 2015, the Entry Clearance Officer refused the  claimant
    entry clearance to join the sponsor in the  United  Kingdom.   He  said
    this:

             "You have provided a letter from Alpha Security Solutions Ltd.
             dated 26 May 2014 which states that your  sponsor  has  worked
             there since May 2014 as a  Business  Development  Manager  and
             since September 2014 his gross annual salary has been �24,000.
             ...

             [HMRC] checks  show  that  your  sponsor's  income  from  this
             employment in the  tax  year  2013  to  2014  was  �15,310.15.
             However, they also show that your sponsor received no  payment
             for April 2015.   Therefore  I  am  not  satisfied  that  your
             sponsor is employed and paid as stated.  I note that you  made
             this application on 27 April 2015 and I am satisfied that your
             sponsor was no longer employed by this company at that time.

             Given all of the above I  am  satisfied,  on  the  balance  of
             probabilities, that you have made false  representations  with
             regard to your sponsor's income."




16. The Entry Clearance Officer concluded that:

             "You have submitted employment documents  for  Alpha  Security
             Solutions Ltd. and given the above I  am  not  satisfied  that
             these represent a true reflection of your sponsor's employment
             circumstances in the UK.  These documents  were  presented  as
             evidence of  you  and  your  sponsor's  ability  to  meet  the
             financial requirement of the Immigration Rules and as a result
             I am not satisfied that you and your sponsor have demonstrated
             that  you  can  meet  the  financial   requirements   of   the
             Immigration Rules.  I therefore refuse your application  under
             paragraph EX-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.
              You have  not  provided  an  original  employment  letter  as
             evidence of your sponsor's gross income from their employment.
              This document is  specified  in  the  guidance  and  must  be
             provided."

    First-tier Tribunal decision

17. The First-tier Judge correctly directed himself with  reference  to  MM
    (Lebanon) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  UKSC  10
    that the minimum income requirements whilst they might sometimes result
    in hardship were lawful. He reminded himself that the relevant date was
    the date of decision, although he was able to take into account matters
    which shed light on that, and were in existence at the relevant time.

18. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found as a fact at [14] that, if the  12-
    month rule were to be applied, then in the financial year preceding the
    date of application the sponsor's  income  did  not  meet  the  �18,600
    threshold (paragraph 14).

19. The judge approached his decision on the basis that  the  6-month  rule
    was applicable because on 27 April 2015 the sponsor had  been  employed
    by Alpha Security Solutions Ltd for more than 6 months.   At  paragraph
    15, however, the judge fell into error.  He said this:

         "15. The 6 months' requirement is  all  that  is  needed  and  [the
             sponsor] does not have to show a full 12-month period  on  the
             information before me.  Given the fact that  the  contract  of
             employment is shown in the bundle  as  commencing  on  26  May
             2014, I am satisfied that he was so employed at  the  date  of
             application and therefore one  needed  only  to  look  back  6
             months prior to that.  Neither the Entry Clearance Officer nor
             the Manager made any reference to  those  Rules  and  to  that
             extent  their  decision  is  not  in   accordance   with   the
             Immigration  Rules  or  practices  that  ought  to  have  been
             applied."

20. The judge went on to deal with Article 8, which is raised by reason  of
    the sponsor's wife being  in  Pakistan  with  their  son,  who,  it  is
    asserted, is a UK citizen. He said this:

         "16. I find that there is  clear  evidence  that  [the  claimant's]
         United Kingdom  sponsor  would  face  insurmountable  obstacles  in
         joining his wife on a permanent basis in Pakistan since he has a UK
         citizen son, almost 3 years old, and who is a UK citizen,  who  was
         born and brought up fully in the UK.  He has  his  family,  friends
         and business interests here, as  well  as  accommodation,  and  the
         combination of those factors effectively means  he  would  have  to
         start again  from  scratch  in  Pakistan.    For  all  intents  and
         purposes he would have to give up his citizenship,  his  rights  of
         citizenship, and those of his United Kingdom child.   In  my  view,
         that amounts to insurmountable obstacles and is not  in  accordance
         with the balancing  act  to  be  conducted,  bearing  in  mind  the
         authority of Huang and Kashmiri v the State Department 2007 UKHL 11
         and with the jurisprudence in MM (Lebanon).  I therefore find  that
         the [Entry Clearance Officer's] refusal of entry clearance for  the
         [claimant]  was  not  in  accordance  with  Immigration  Rules   or
         Practices that ought to be applied and in any event,  the  decision
         is not proportionate to the need to maintain  immigration  control,
         bearing in mind the grave  consequences  that  will  flow  for  the
         United Kingdom sponsor if he was forced to join his wife and son in
         Pakistan. The decision would in any event, be incompatible with the
         [claimant's] rights under @8 ECHR taking inot  accont  te  5  stage
         test set out by Lord Bingham in R v Secretary  of  State  ex  parte
         Razgar H.L.27, 2004."

21. That crucial paragraph is somewhat hard to follow,  partly  because  it
    contains typographical errors, which I have reproduced here.  It  takes
    no account of the inclusion of the Article 8 ECHR analysis  within  the
    Immigration Rules since 2014, nor of recent case law apprehend that  it
    is the sponsor who is said to be a  United  Kingdom  citizen  born  and
    brought up fully here, with family, friends and business  interests  in
    the United Kingdom.

22. The First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed the appeal under the  Immigration
    Rules and Article 8 ECHR.  The Entry Clearance Officer appealed to  the
    Upper Tribunal.

    Permission to appeal

23. First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer granted permission on the basis of the
    Entry Clearance Officer's grounds, which argued that the Judge had made
    contradictory findings, failed to give adequate  reasons,  and  ignored
    relevant evidence.  He contended that the finances of the  sponsor  did
    not meet the minimum income requirement threshold, having regard to his
    two employments, at the  date  of  application  and  that  the  Judge's
    decision did not make it clear how  he  had  calculated  the  sponsor's
    income, nor why he had discounted the HMRC evidence.

24. Further, the Entry Clearance Officer argued that  in  relation  to  the
    Article 8 ECHR  element  of  the  appeal,  the  Judge  had  applied  an
    incorrect test and that it was open to the  parties  to  make  a  fresh
    application under the Rules.   To allow the appeal under Article 8 ECHR
    outside the Immigration Rules was to  permit  the  claimant  to  'queue
    jump' and no disproportionate interference with the established private
    and family life had been shown.

25. There was no Rule 24 Reply to the grant of permission.

26. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

    Upper Tribunal hearing

27. For the Entry Clearance Officer, Mr Wilding relied on  his  grounds  of
    appeal.

28. For the claimant, Mr Mahmoud argued that the Entry Clearance  Officer's
    grounds of appeal indicated a lack of understanding of the  Immigration
    Rules or the Judge's decision. He sought to rely on a later letter from
    the sponsor's employer, dated 7 April 2017, but that  is  not  evidence
    which was or could have been before the Entry Clearance Officer, and  I
    can place no weight thereon.

29. Mr Mahmoud complained that the DVR evidence was inadequate  as  it  was
    not signed and the official's name was not given.  He said that none of
    the original documents were in the claimant's  position,  all  of  them
    having been given to the Entry  Clearance  Officer.   He  disputed  the
    assertion by the Entry Clearance Officer in the refusal letter that the
    documents produced were not  originals  but  he  could  not  produce  a
    receipt, or a covering letter, listing what had been put  forward  with
    the application.  Mr Mahmoud remarked that  this  had  been  an  online
    application and there was no evidence that the  documents  relied  upon
    had not been original documents.  The claimant's sponsor met the �18600
    threshold and the appeal should be allowed.

    Discussion

30. I consider first the reasoning underlying of the First-tier  Tribunal's
    finding of fact that the sponsor was still working for Alpha when  this
    application was submitted on 27 April 2015.  The  DVR  is  indeed  both
    unsigned and anonymous, but the evidence produced by the  sponsor  (the
    originals of which are not before me)  does  not  include  any  payslip
    after 5 February  2015.   That  is  not  evidence  that  the  sponsor's
    employment continued up to and including 27  April  2015.   I  consider
    that the Judge's finding that it did is not supported by  the  evidence
    and cannot be sustained.

31. The judge failed to engage with the finding  in  the  refusal  decision
    letter that the sponsor's recorded income for the tax year 2014/2015 of
    �15,310 fell below the figure of  �24,000  given  in  the  contract  of
    employment submitted with his application, nor did he  explore  whether
    the Entry Clearance Officer was right to conclude that the sponsor  had
    (whether knowingly or otherwise) deceived the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    by saying that his income was �24,000 when in fact,  at  best,  it  was
    something under �16,000, even taking into account the additional income
    from his second job.

32. The most important point, however, is that the judge failed to consider
    the effect as regards the application of the 12-month rule  or  the  6-
    month rule, having regard to the sponsor not having received any salary
    payment for April 2015, and confirmed by the enquiries recorded in  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's DVR.  From 1 May 2015, the sponsor's case  is
    that he was working for himself, trading as Regency  Security  Services
    UK Ltd.

33. The correct analysis is that, having earned no money from any  salaried
    employer in the month ending 24 April 2015, on 27 April 2015 when  this
    application was submitted, the claimant did not have a current employer
    and could not, therefore, take advantage of the 6-month rule and  argue
    that his earnings from Alpha should be grossed up to an  annual  figure
    which exceeded the �18600 threshold.

34. As a person with no current employer on the date  of  application,  the
    sponsor had to show that  his  actual  earnings  from  all  sources  in
    2014/2015 exceeded �18600, which they did not.  The immigration judge's
    findings to the contrary are a factual error at the level of  an  error
    of law and I do not understand how he reached the conclusion he did  on
    the law.  I set aside the findings of fact  and  remake  the  decision,
    finding that the reality is that the sponsor stopped working for  Alpha
    before the application was made and therefore had to meet the  12-month
    rule, which he could not do.

35. The next question is Article 8 ECHR.  The Judge's decision contains  no
    reference to recent case law.  I have had regard to  the  decisions  of
    the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  v
    Onuorah [2017] EWCA Civ 1757 and in Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department v Abbas [2017] EWCA Civ 1393.  I remind myself that there is
    no birth certificate for the child in the bundle, and  that  Article  8
    ECHR is not a general dispensing power.  This family has conducted  its
    private and family life remotely now for several years  and  I  do  not
    consider that the putative existence of this  child  is  sufficient  to
    amount to exceptional circumstances or that the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    findings as to the difficulty of the sponsor joining  the  claimant  in
    Pakistan is made out.  I note, particularly, that he has  travelled  to
    Pakistan for 4 months every year, since the marriage.

36. I therefore set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  I
    substitute a decision dismissing the appeal.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.
