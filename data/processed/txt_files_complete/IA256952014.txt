Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr A Pipe, instructed by Khan & Co Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing  Mr  Babatunde's
   appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse  his  application  for
   leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.

2. For the purposes of this decision,  I  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
   Secretary of State as the respondent and Mr Babatunde as  the  appellant,
   reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before  the  First-
   tier Tribunal.

3. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 10 February 1975.  He  came
   to the United Kingdom in September 2008 as a student and was subsequently
   granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant in February
   2010. In January 2012 he  was  granted  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  2
   (General) Migrant until 25 May 2014. On 6 May 2014 he applied for further
   leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.

4. The appellant's application was refused on 3 June 2014 on the basis  that
   the salary included in his Certificate of Sponsorship was not at or above
   the appropriate rate for the job, as specified under Appendix  A  of  the
   Immigration  Rules  and  the  Codes  of  Practice  at  Appendix  J.   His
   certificate of Sponsorship stated that his  prospective  employment  most
   closely corresponded to occupation code 2123. The minimum acceptable rate
   of pay for a 39 hour working week for that  employment  was  �32,500  per
   annum, whereas his Certificate of  Sponsorship  stated  that  his  salary
   would be �28,000 per annum for a 40 hour week which  equated  to  �27,300
   for a 39 hour week.

5. The appellant appealed against that decision. In his  grounds  of  appeal
   to the First-tier Tribunal  he  stated  that  his  employer  had  made  a
   clerical error in selecting the code and that the correct  code  matching
   his job description for a Network Engineer should  have  been  2139,  for
   which he was receiving the appropriate salary.  He  stated  that  he  was
   enclosing a letter from his employer to that effect. He asserted  further
   that the Home Office caseworker should have applied discretion under  the
   immigration rules by contacting his employer to verify the information or
   by taking his employment offer letter and payslip as proof.

6. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ghaffar  on  27  August
   2014. The judge heard oral evidence  from  the  appellant  and  from  the
   director  of  the  company  for  which  he  worked.  He  found  that  the
   appellant's  employer  had  made  a  genuine  error.  The  appellant  had
   previously declared a salary of �28,000 and remained in the same role and
   on the same salary and the accompanying documents evidenced that  he  was
   not applying to remain to work in an upgraded role  within  the  company.
   The caseworker ought to have contacted the appellant  in  line  with  the
   Guidance.

7. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by  the  respondent
   on the grounds that the judge had failed to  apply  section  85A  of  the
   Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and had considered  evidence
   not adduced in support of the appellant's application  contrary  to  that
   provision; and that he had failed to apply binding caselaw  in  Rahman  v
   Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 11.

8. Permission to appeal was granted on 27 October 2014.
Appeal Hearing

9. The appeal came before me on 20 July 2015. I heard submissions from  both
   parties.

10. Mr Smart produced a note taken by the presenting officer at the  hearing
   before Judge Ghaffar in which she recorded that the judge  had  indicated
   as a preliminary issue that the respondent's decision was correct on  the
   basis of  the  application  made  and  that  he  needed  to  make  a  new
   application. He said that he was producing the note as a response to  the
   allegation made in the appellant's Rule  24  reply  that  the  presenting
   officer did not  challenge  the  appellant's  evidence  relating  to  the
   correction of a mistake and submitted that that  explained  the  lack  of
   detailed submissions. He submitted that  section  85A  of  the  2002  Act
   prevented the judge from considering the evidence referring to the  error
   and that the judge's decision  was  inconsistent  with  the  findings  in
   Rahman and Kaur v The Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2015]
   EWCA Civ 13. The appellant should have made a fresh application  and  his
   email to the Home Office of 5 June 2014 suggested that that was  what  he
   had intended to do.

11. Mr Pipe, in his submissions, relied upon the  letter  of  16  June  2014
   from the appellant's employer referring to advice given  to  him  by  the
   Home Office that the appellant should appeal the decision. The  appellant
   had therefore followed the instructions of the Home Office. The judge was
   entitled to conclude that this was a matter  of  a  clerical  error.  The
   exceptions to section 85A allowed for corrections of  errors,  albeit  in
   respect to refusals under the general grounds  for  refusal  and  it  was
   important to have regard to the mischief the  exceptions  were  meant  to
   address. The  description  of  the  appellant's  job,  network  engineer,
   clearly  met  the  correct  code.  The  appellant's  circumstances   were
   different to  those  in  Rahman,  in  particular  as  the  appellant  was
   encouraged by the Home Office to appeal.

Consideration and Findings

12.  Whilst the  circumstances  in  this  case  are  unfortunate  and  I  am
   sympathetic to the appellant, the fact remains that section  85A  of  the
   2002 Act prevented the judge from considering evidence  other  than  that
   adduced at the time of  making  his  application.  The  letter  from  the
   appellant's employer and the email sent to the Home  Office  are  all  in
   response to the refusal decision and thus were by their very  nature  not
   submitted to the respondent together with  the  appellant's  application.
   The respondent made a decision  on  the  evidence  before  her  and  that
   evidence demonstrated that the appellant could not meet the  requirements
   of the immigration rules. There was nothing unlawful about that decision.



13. There is no provision within section 85A for the correction of  what  is
   said to be an error, in the circumstances arising in this case. I do  not
   agree  with  Mr  Pipe  that  the   appellant's   circumstances   can   be
   distinguished from those in Rahman and Kaur. It is clear from both  cases
   that the question of unfairness was found to arise only  in  cases  where
   there was some fault on  the  part  of  the  Home  Office  or  where  the
   appellant could not be considered to bear any responsibility in  relation
   to omissions or errors in the application. There was no obligation on the
   respondent to give the appellant an opportunity to seek an  amendment  to
   the CoS before a decision was taken on the  application.   Such  findings
   are made clear at paragraph 32 of Rahman, as follows:

   "I am not sure whether the appellant had an opportunity to check the  CAS
   following its completion by the sponsor, and I  note  that  part  of  the
   argument for the appellant is that he should not  be  penalised  for  the
   shortcomings of an institution of study over which  he  had  no  control.
   Nevertheless I agree with the tribunal that the situation  here  is  very
   different from that in Naved  and  that  fairness  did  not  require  the
   Secretary of State to give the appellant an opportunity  to  address  any
   deficiency in the CAS.  There  was  no  question  in  this  case  of  the
   Secretary of State obtaining additional information without reference  to
   the applicant and relying on it to refuse the application. The  Secretary
   of State simply applied the terms of the  Immigration  Rules  themselves.
   Under the Rules it was  the  appellant  who  had  the  responsibility  of
   ensuring that his application  was  supported  by  a  CAS  that  met  the
   requirements laid down. If the CAS did not meet  those  requirements,  it
   could not earn him an entitlement to points. If the deficiency in the CAS
   was the result of a mistake on the part of the sponsor (a point which, as
   I have said, was not even  raised  by  the  appellant  in  the  tribunals
   below), it was a matter to be  pursued  between  the  appellant  and  the
   sponsor. There was no obligation on the Secretary of State  to  give  the
   appellant an opportunity to  seek  an  amendment  to  the  CAS  before  a
   decision was taken on the application."


14. Such an  approach  was  endorsed  in  Kaur.  It  is  asserted  that  the
   appellant's case is distinguishable on the grounds that  the  appellant's
   employer, Mr Peel, was advised by the Home Office to appeal the decision.
   However, it is clear from Mr Peel's letter  of  16  June  2014  that  the
   advice was made by an advisor with little knowledge or  understanding  of
   the appellant's situation  and  cannot  be  said  to  give  rise  to  any
   expectation on the part of  the  appellant  that  he  would  be  able  to
   circumvent the requirements of the rules or the provisions of section 85A
   of the 2002 Act.

15. Accordingly the judge was wrong to accept the explanation given  by  the
   appellant's employer as a means by which to find that the  appellant  was
   able to meet the requirements  of  the  immigration  rules.  Furthermore,
   there was no basis upon which the judge could, as  an  alternative,  have
   found the respondent's decision not to be in  accordance  with  the  law.
   There was simply no unfairness,  in  legal  terms,  in  the  respondent's
   decision. It was not for the judge to  interfere  with  the  respondent's
   exercise of discretion and there was no evidence before the judge to show
   that the respondent had acted in breach of the terms  of  a  policy.  The
   guidance referred to at paragraph 6 of the judge's decision has not  been
   clarified and does not appear to have been produced.

16. Accordingly, the judge's decision is not a sustainable one  and  has  to
   be set aside and re-made by dismissing the appeal under  the  immigration
   rules. It is open to the appellant to make a fresh application and it  is
   to be hoped, given  the  circumstances,  that  the  respondent  will  not
   penalise him in such an application for it being made outside the  period
   of his leave. That is, however,  a  matter  for  the  discretion  of  the
   Secretary of State.

17. Mr Pipe accepted that Article 8 was not pleaded  before  the  judge  and
   accordingly there is nothing further for me to consider.



DECISION

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error
   on a point of law. The Secretary of State's appeal is accordingly allowed
   and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. I  re-make  the
   decision by dismissing Mr Babatunde's appeal.
