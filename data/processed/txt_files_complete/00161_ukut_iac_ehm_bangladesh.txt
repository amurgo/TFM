When assessing whether a Tier 4  (General)  applicant  has  an  "established
presence", the relevant date for calculating  whether  he  has  completed  a
course  of  study  within  specified  periods  of  time  is  the   date   of
application.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The appellant is a  citizen  of  Bangladesh.   He  attended  the  hearing
unrepresented. I explained that I would assist him as  far  as  I  could  in
ensuring his case was put to best effect.

2. On 30 March 2010 he  had  applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
(General) Student Migrant under the Points Based System and for a  biometric
document.  In a determination notified  on  5  August  2010  the  First-tier
Tribunal (Immigration Judge Monro) dismissed his appeal against  a  decision
dated 12 May 2010 that he did not meet in  full  the  requirements  of  para
245ZX(d) of HC 395 as amended.

3. The  IJ  concluded  that  the  appellant  did  not  qualify  for  reduced
maintenance levels as he had not  shown  he  had  "an  established  presence
studying in the United Kingdom" and so as a result he had not shown  he  had
sufficient in funds.  The IJ stated:

    "As he started a new course in October, that 6 month course would  have
    had to  cover  the  period  April  to  September  2009.   There  is  no
    information before me as to  what  course  if  any  the  appellant  was
    studying during the relevant period".

4. The appellant was successful in obtaining permission  to  appeal  on  the
basis of a submission that the IJ was wrong to find that he  had  not  shown
he met all the requirements of para 245ZX.  In particular he submitted  that
he had in fact demonstrated that he had  completed  a  course  that  was  at
least 6 months long during the last period of his leave (his last  grant  of
leave was from 26 March 2009 to 31 March  2010)  and  so  should  have  been
treated as qualifying for a reduced maintenance level.

5. In her determination the IJ had cited  the  respondent's  Tier  4  Policy
Guidance.  She referred to paras 34-38 but in fact the provisions which  she
cited are to be found at paras 104-112 of Tier 4 of the Points Based  System
- Policy Guidance version 03/10 "to be used  for  all  Tier  4  applications
made on or after 3 March 2010".  The relevant passages are:

    "104.  The amount of money a student had to show will depend on whether
    he/she already has an established presence in the  United  Kingdom.   A
    student that has an established presence in the United Kingdom needs to
    show less money for living costs.


         A student ... has an established presence studying  in  the  United
         Kingdom if he/she was last given permission to stay under  Tier  4,
         as a student ... and he/she:


         Has completed a single course of at least six months during his/her
         last grant of leave;
         or


         Is  currently  studying  a  single  course,  of  which  he/she  has
         completed at least six months;
         or


         Is currently studying and has completed a single course of at least
         six months during his/her current permission to stay.


         And his/her last grant of leave ended  no  more  than  four  months
         before his/her Tier 4 application was made; or


         He/she is currently following a course of study.


         A student cannot amalgamate two or more courses to make up the  six
         months' study.


         ...


         106.     A student can qualify for the reduced  maintenance  levels
         whether he/she is applying from inside the United Kingdom  or  from
         overseas.


         107.     A student that  does  not  have  an  established  presence
         studying in the United Kingdom must show that he/she has money  for
         his/her living costs for each month  of  his/her  course  up  to  a
         maximum of 9 months.


         108.     A student with an established  presence  studying  in  the
         United Kingdom must show that he/she has money for  his/her  living
         costs for each month of his/her course up to a maximum of 2 months.


         ...


         109.     A student that  does  not  have  an  established  presence
         studying in the United Kingdom must show that he/she has money  for
         his/her course fees plus:


         Inner London - �800 for living costs for each month of their course
         up to a maximum of 9 months ...


         Outer London ...


         110.     A student that does have an established presence  studying
         in the United Kingdom must show that he/she has money  for  his/her
         course fees plus:


         Inner London - �800 for  living  costs  for  each  month  of  their
         course, up to a maximum of 2 months.


         Outer London ...


         112.     Examples of the money required are given in Annex 5."




6. By the time the appellant's application for  permission  to  appeal  came
before a Senior  Immigration  Judge  the  Court  of  Appeal  had  given  its
judgment in Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 719.  Understandably,  in  view  of  the
IJ's seemingly exclusive reliance on  Policy  Guidance,  this  led  the  SIJ
concerned to consider that there was an arguable error of law.   However  it
does not appear to have been appreciated  that  the  applicable  Immigration
Rules themselves specify in Appendix A both what is  "established  presence"
and the requisite level of funds (in addition to  course  fees)  needed  for
Tier 4 applicants.


7. Para 245ZX(d), as amended on 6  April  2010  (HC  439),  states  that  to
qualify "The applicant must have a minimum of 10 points under paragraphs 10
to 14 of Appendix C".  the latter state:

    "Tier 4 (General) Students


    10.    A Tier 4 (General) Student must score 10 points for funds.


    11.    10 points will only be awarded if the funds shown in  the  table
         below are available to the applicant and the applicant provides the
         specified documents to show this.  Notes  to  accompany  the  table
         appear below the table.


    Criterion


    If studying in inner London:


         (i)Where the  applicant  does  not  have  an  established  presence
         studying in the United  Kingdom,  the  applicant  must  have  funds
         amounting to the full course fees for the first  academic  year  of
         the course, or for the entire course if it  is  less  than  a  year
         long, plus �800 for each month of the course up  to  a  maximum  of
         nine months.


          (ii)    Where the applicant has an established  presence  studying
         in the United Kingdom, the applicant must have funds  amounting  to
         the course fees required either for the remaining academic year  if
         the applicant  is  applying  part-way  through,  or  for  the  next
         academic year if the applicant will  continue  or  commence  a  new
         course at the start of the next academic year, or  for  the  entire
         course if it is less than a year long, plus �800 for each month  of
         the course up to a maximum of two months.


     "Notes"


    12.    An applicant will be considered to be studying in London if  the
    institution, or branch of the institution, at which the applicant  will
    be studying is situated in a London Borough  specified  in  the  United
    Kingdom Border Agency guidance. If the applicant will  be  studying  at
    more than one site, one or more of which is in London and one  or  more
    outside, then the applicant will be considered to be studying  at  more
    than one site, one or more of which  is  in  London  and  one  or  more
    outside, then the applicant will be considered to be studying in London
    if the applicant's ... {Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies}  states
    that the applicant will be spending the majority of time studying at  a
    site or sites situated in London.


    13.    Guidance published by the United Kingdom Border Agency will  set
         out when funds will be considered to be available to an  applicant,
         including the circumstances in which the money must be that of  the
         applicant and the extent to which a  sponsorship  arrangement  that
         provides the required funds will suffice.


    14.    An applicant will have an established presence studying  in  the
         United Kingdom if the applicant has completed a course that was  at
         least six months long within their last period of leave as a Tier 4
         migrant, a student or as a Postgraduate Doctor or Dentist, and this
         course finished within the last four months, or  the  applicant  is
         applying for continued study on a course where  the  applicant  has
         completed at least six months of that course and has been  studying
         within the last four months."


8.  In  DN  (student;  course  'completed';  'established  presence')  Kenya
[2010] UKUT 443 the Tribunal held that in order to  show  only  two  months'
worth of 'Maintenance' under Appendix C, rather than being required to  show
nine months' worth, a student must have been studying  on  a  course  within
the last four months, and that course must itself have lasted for more  than
six months.  The course may still be continuing, but if it came  to  an  end
within the last four months, and the student is embarking on another  course
(or repeating the same course), it matters not whether he was successful  on
the  previous  course.   Appendix  C  requires  the  course  to  have   been
'completed' no more than four months before, but that should  not  be  taken
to mean 'successfully completed'.  The notion of 'established presence'  for
Maintenance purposes requires presence  as  a  student,  not  success  as  a
student.

9. During the course of submissions several things became clear.  First,  it
is not in dispute that the appellant is someone who is  "studying  in  inner
London" for the purposes of the Rules. Second, the appellant  did  not  have
at the relevant time sufficient in savings to cover the full  costs  of  the
fees of his course together with �800 for each month of the course, up to  a
maximum of 9 months.  (To do that he would have needed to  show  he  was  in
possession of �8,400 at least at  the  time  of  application  which  was  30
March. In fact the most he had been able to show was that he  had  �3,721.78
in his possession (on 19 March 2010)). On the other  hand,  the  respondent
accepted that he could qualify under Appendix C of the Rules if he was  only
required  to  show  a  reduced  rate  of  funds  by  virtue  of  having   an
"established presence" as defined in paragraph 14.

10. The first question that arises is did the IJ err  in  trying  to  decide
the case by  reference  to  the  Policy  Guidance  provisions  dealing  with
persons having  established  presence?   Even  though  the  Policy  Guidance
cannot be used to establish  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules,
Sedley LJ made clear in Pankina that it can  nevertheless  give  rise  to  a
legitimate expectation that  appellants  should  be  able  to  benefit  from
Policy Guidance provisions that are more generous than  the  Rules:  see  HM
and others (PBS  -  legitimate  expectation  -  paragraph  245ZX(I))  Malawi
[2010] UKUT 446 (IAC).  However, in  respect  of  established  presence  the
requirements  of  the  Policy  Guidance  do  no  more  than  reiterate   the
requirements of paras 10-14 of Appendix C.  Hence the IJ did not err in  law
in applying the criteria she did relating to Tier 4 (General) Students.

11. The next question arising is this.  Given that  the  IJ  relied  on  the
correct requirements, although failing to note they  were  set  out  in  the
Rules and not just in Policy Guidance, did she err in law in concluding  the
appellant could not show established presence? In my judgment she did not.

12. From October 2008 - May 2009 the  appellant  was  at  Guildhall  College
pursuing  an  ABE  degree.   He  discontinued  that.   In  October  2009  he
commenced a foundation course at the  London  College  of  Advanced  Studies
(LCAS).  His main BSC course in Business Information Technology (Top Up)  at
this same college was due to start on 8 February 2010.

13. It is plain that at the date of application in March 2010  he  had  been
studying in the UK within the last four months, so he met  this  element  of
the para 14 requirements.

14. However he also needed to show he met the other elements of the para  14
requirements, namely, either: (1) that during his last period  of  leave  he
had completed a single course  of  at  least  six  months;  or  (2)  he  was
applying for continued study on a course where he  has  completed  at  least
six months of that course  and  has  been  studying  within  the  last  four
months.

15. In the appellant's case, recalling that his leave to remain ran from  29
March 2009 to 31 March 2010 and that he applied on 30 March 2010,  he could
only qualify under (1) if his foundation course, which commenced in  October
2009, was of at least six months' duration by the date his period  of  leave
was due to expire (31 March 2010).  However, in a letter from LCAS dated  30
June 2010 it is stated that the appellant "was  doing  a  degree  foundation
course from October 2009 to January 2010 since his main course (BSc BIT  top
up) had started on 8  February  2010."   Accordingly,  being  only  of  four
months duration,  the appellant could not qualify under (1).

16. Could the appellant come within (2) above?  Again, the  appellant  could
show he had been studying within the last  four  months.   However,  by  the
date of decision on 5 August 2010 we know from this  same  letter  that  the
appellant was enrolled on the BSc BIT top  up  course  which  started  on  8
February 2010.  Even if the requirement in (2) were to be understood as  one
solely concerned with whether the applicant satisfies it as at the  date  of
decision, then even then the  appellant  fell  (just)  short  of  6  months.
However, Appendix  C  clearly  contemplates  that  the  applicant  shows  he
satisfied this requirement at the date of  application  (in  this  case,  30
March 2010).  On the date of application the appellant was  not  studying  a
(single) course of which he had completed 6 months. He was only a few  weeks
into the course. That the date of application is  the  applicable  point  in
time for calculating such matters is clear from the wording of  para  1A  of
Appendix C: "In all cases where an applicant is required  to  obtain  points
under Appendix C, the  applicant  must  have  the  funds  specified  in  the
relevant parts of Appendix C at the date of the application  and  must  also
have had those  funds  for  a  period  of  time  set  out  in  the  guidance
specifying the specified documents for that purpose".

17. Accordingly the appellant failed to  show  he  would  benefit  from  the
relevant provisions of Appendix C which allow for reduced fees.

18. Where do these conclusions leave this appeal?  Looking back at the  IJ's
determination it  can  be  seen  that  she  did  not  refer  either  to  the
significance of the relevant provisions of Appendix  C  of  the  Immigration
Rules or to the correct version of the Policy Guidance, nor  did  she  refer
to the legal guidance given in Pankina.  Nonetheless,  the  version  of  the
Policy Guidance she did cite was to the same effect as the  correct  version
and did no more than reiterate the requirements set out  in  para  10-14  of
Appendix C of the Immigration Rules. The IJ also made clear in para  5  that
she would have been prepared to accept that  the  appellant  "qualified  for
the reduced fund requirement" if he was able to show that he  had  completed
a single course of at least six months during this  last  period  of  leave.
She found that the appellant had not shown that  and,  hence  dismissed  the
appeal.

19. In summary, notwithstanding certain shortcomings,  the  IJ's  assessment
was properly based on the appellant's failure to  show  he  qualified  under
para 245ZX.  That assessment was not vitiated by legal error.
