Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Rene, of Counsel instructed by Debridge
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against a decision  of
    Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Dineen  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 29 January 2016 allowed the appeal of  Mr  Giressia  [M]
    against a decision of the Secretary of State made on 31  July  2015  to
    refuse to grant him leave to remain on human rights grounds following a
    decision to deport which had been made on 6 February 2015.  Although Mr
    Giressia [M] is the respondent before me I will refer  to  him  as  the
    appellant as he was the respondent in  the  First-tier.   Similarly,  I
    will refer to the Secretary of State as the respondent as she  was  the
    respondent in the First-tier.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Angola born on 26 May 1985.   He  entered
    Britain in 1988 at the age of 2 or 3 with his  father,  stepmother  and
    sister.  He was granted indefinite leave to remain on 4 January 1999.

3.   In June 2005 he was sentenced  to  30  months  in  a  young  offenders'
    institution for robbery and in July 2008 received a  sentence  of  nine
    months' imprisonment for an offence of burglary and theft together with
    a breach of a community order.

4.   On 24 November 2008 a decision was made to  deport  him.   He  appealed
    against that decision.  His appeal was allowed under Article 8  of  the
    ECHR in a determination dated 4 March 2009.

5.   The appellant's indefinite leave to remain was revoked on  31  December
    2009.  His appeal against revocation was dismissed in August  2010  but
    he was then granted discretionary leave to remain for three years.

6.   On 11 October 2011 he was convicted  of  breach  of  a  non-molestation
    order and fined �100 and ordered to pay  costs  of  �85  and  a  victim
    surcharge of �15.  In January 2012 he was convicted of a  breach  of  a
    non-molestation  order  and  given  a  community  order   with   unpaid
    requirement of 80 hours and was ordered to pay costs of �85.  In  March
    2012 and again in May 2012 he was convicted of failure to  comply  with
    the requirements of a community order.  On the first  occasion  he  was
    given a residence requirement of one day and an order to pay  costs  of
    �20 and on the second occasion the order was directed to  continue  and
    he was given a consecutive unpaid work requirement of ten hours.

7.   Thereafter the decision to deport was made and further the decision  to
    refuse leave to remain on human rights grounds.

8.   Judge Dineen commented, having reviewed the  appellant's  history  that
    he had "built up a case against himself  which  might  be  thought,  at
    least at first glance, to be rather formidable".

9.   He then referred to the applicant's rights under Article 8 of the  ECHR
    and noted that his attention had been drawn to the determination of the
    Tribunal who had heard the appellant's appeal on 20 February 2009.

10.  He referred to paragraph 67 of that determination in which it had  been
    determined that the appellant was exercising private  life  in  Britain
    which consisted of social ties and ties with his natural family.  Judge
    Dineen stated that the determination indicated that the applicant had a
    strong private life in Britain which came close to being a family life.
     He concluded that the  appellant's  removal  to  Angola  would  be  an
    interference with his  rights  to  private  life  before  going  on  to
    concluding that such interference would be lawful.  He then  turned  to
    the issue of whether or not the removal of the  appellant  would  be  a
    proportionate response and emphasised that  he  had  to  consider  that
    within the concept of the Immigration Rules.

11.  In paragraphs 18 onwards of the determination he wrote:-

         "18. Firstly I note that he falls under Immigration Rules paragraph
             398(b) because his deportation from the UK is conducive to the
             public good and in the public interest  because  he  has  been
             convicted of an offence for which he has been sentenced to  at
             least twelve months imprisonment.

         19.  I then have to consider whether he falls within paragraph 399A
             of the Immigration Rules.  If he  does  not  then  the  public
             interest in deportation will only be outweighed by  any  other
             factors  applicable  to  him  if  there  are  very  compelling
             circumstances.

         20.  I therefore  consider  paragraph  399A.   Under  (a)  of  this
             paragraph it is required that he has been lawfully resident in
             the UK for most of his life.  I  find  that  he  fulfils  this
             requirement because he was here lawfully as a dependant  until
             being granted indefinite leave to remain.  He was present with
             indefinite leave to remain until the date at  which  that  was
             revoked and he has therefore been in the UK for  most  of  his
             life.

         21.   I  am  also  satisfied  that  since  the  revocation  of  his
             indefinite leave to remain he has also been present in the  UK
             lawfully because the respondent announced that he  would  have
             discretionary leave to remain.  That was never itself  revoked
             and it was reinforced and repeated by a letter  which  appears
             at W3 of the respondent's appeal  bundle  dated  4th  February
             2014 which states 'We have decided to grant you  three  years'
             discretionary  leave  to  remain  in  the   United   Kingdom'.
             Therefore while a three  year  period  began  to  run  on  the
             removal of his indefinite leave to remain it  appears  that  a
             further three year period could legitimately be inferred  from
             the  letter  of  4th  February  2014.   He  therefore  fulfils
             paragraph 399A(a).

         22.  Paragraph 399A(b) requires that he be socially and  culturally
             integrated into the UK.  I find by reference to paragraphs  67
             and 68 of the determination of Judge Davies referred to  above
             and by the  application  of  the  principle  in  the  case  of
             Devaseelan that he has established that he  is  thus  socially
             and culturally integrated.

         23.  The final requirement of 399A is  that  there  would  be  very
             significant obstacles to his integration into the  country  to
             which it is proposed he  is  deported.   So  far  as  that  is
             concerned I have also to have regard to the judgment of  Judge
             Davies at paragraph 69.  This states as follows:

                  'In respect to Angola we find that the  appellant  has  no
                  family ties there that he knows of.  We find  his  natural
                  mother is dead - that was both his evidence and  it  is  a
                  fact that was recorded  in  one  of  the  social  services
                  reports, a fact reported to them by his father.   We  find
                  that he does not speak any Angolan language  and  that  he
                  has no connections by which he  could  secure  employment.
                  In the absence of these we find that if deported  he  will
                  find it extremely hard,  if  not  impossible,  to  find  a
                  source of income from which to survive.  It is clear  from
                  the Foreign and Commonwealth Office  advice  that  violent
                  crime is widespread in Angola, and that  those  identified
                  as foreigners are  vulnerable.   We  accept  Mr  Bartram's
                  submission that the appellant  is  de  facto  British  and
                  likely to be perceived as such.  We find that malaria  and
                  cholera are common in Angola, as stated in the FCO advice,
                  and we find that  the  appellant  runs  a  risk  of  being
                  exposed to these if deported to Angola'.

             It is not suggested that there is any circumstance  subsequent
             to Judge Davies' decision which alters any of the above.

         24.  I find in the light of the above  that  there  would  be  very
             significant obstacles to the appellant's integration into  the
             country to which it is proposed he be deported.

         25.  In those circumstances  it  is  not  necessary  to  find  very
             compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
             paragraph 399A.  I find that  the  appellant  is  entitled  to
             benefit from limited leave to remain under paragraph 399B.  He
             should regard himself as very fortunate that he  comes  within
             these provisions.  Any  future  offending  may  lead  to  dire
             results for him."

12.  Judge Dineen therefore allowed the appeal on Article  8  grounds.   The
    Secretary of State appealed, alleging that the judge had not taken into
    account and resolved  conflicts  of  opinion  on  material  matters  as
    detailed in the deportation letter which had set out the  reasons  why,
    despite Judge Davies' findings,  the  appellant  would  not  face  very
    significant obstacles to integration and therefore had not  taken  into
    account factors which were pertinent to the question which  was  before
    him.  Paragraphs 39 to 44 of that letter were  then  reproduced.   They
    had stated:-

         "39. It is not  accepted  that  there  would  be  very  significant
             obstacles to your integration into the country to which it  is
             proposed  to  deport  you.   It  is  noted  from  the   appeal
             determination promulgated on 4 March 2009 that the Immigration
             Judge said that you would '...find it extremely hard,  if  not
             impossible,  to  find  a  source  of  income  from  which   to
             survive...' in Angola, and that it was also held that you  had
             no familial ties to the country and could not speak any of the
             languages.   However,  these  issues  do   not   automatically
             constitute very  significant  obstacles  to  integration.   It
             should be noted that the test under  paragraph  399A  is  very
             high and concerns whether or not you could integrate in Angola
             upon return, rather than whether or not it is proportionate to
             deport you there given your lack of ties; as was found in  the
             aforementioned appeal'.

         40.  Regarding language, you have provided no evidence  to  suggest
             that you would be unable to  learn  Portuguese,  the  official
             language of Angola.  Doing so  would  significantly  aid  your
             integration when seeking employment and forming social ties.

         41.  In relation to securing  an  income,  there  is  no  objective
             evidence to suggest that you could  not  sustain  yourself  on
             return.  There is nothing to suggest that the labour market or
             the levels of unemployment in Angola are such that  you  would
             be unable to find employment and maintain yourself on  return.
             As confirmed by your representations, you have family  in  the
             UK who may be able to provide financial assistance to you, and
             you are eligible to apply for the Facilitated  Returns  Scheme
             (FRS) to alleviate financial difficulties.

         42.  It is also noted  from  paragraph  71  of  the  aforementioned
             appeal determination that the Immigration Judge dismissed  the
             concept of your being at risk in  Angola  simply  because  you
             will be  a  returnee.   No  evidence  has  been  submitted  to
             challenge this finding  and  there  has  been  no  fundamental
             change in the country  situation  in  Angola  from  when  your
             appeal hearing  took  place.   The  Foreign  and  Commonwealth
             Office (FCO) does not advise against travel to the majority of
             Angola, with the exception of the provinces  of  Cabinda  (not
             including Cabinda city) and Lunda Norte, to which  it  advises
             against all but essential travel.  There  is  no  evidence  to
             suggest that you would have reason  to  reside  in  either  of
             these provinces upon return, or that you would  be  unable  to
             reside in any of the other areas of the country to  which  the
             FCO does not advise against travel.

         43.  It is therefore  considered  that  the  above  issues  do  not
             constitute  very  significant  obstacles  to  integration   in
             Angola, and that no  other  evidence  has  been  submitted  to
             indicate that any exist.

         44.  Therefore, having considered  the  individual  facts  of  your
             case, it is not accepted that you meet the requirements of the
             private life exception to deportation."

13.  The grounds went on to argue that the  judge  had  failed  to  make  an
    assessment in the appeal and he was not entitled merely to rely on  the
    principle of Devaseelan particularly where  there  have  been  material
    developments such as a change in the  Immigration  Rules.   They  argue
    that there had been a change in the law since 2009 when the  First-tier
    Tribunal had made its decision in favour of the appellant.  Although it
    is accepted that the judge had been right to adopt the 2009 findings as
    a starting point he had to make individual findings of fact within  the
    existing framework and the failure to do  so  amounted  to  a  material
    misdirection of law.

14.  At the hearing of the appeal before me  Mr  Walker  stated  that  there
    were two issues in the appeal.  The first was the fact that  the  judge
    had not placed weight on the assertion to the Reason for Refusal Letter
    with regard to the obstacles which  would  face  the  applicant  if  he
    returned to Angola and, secondly, that it was not accepted that he  had
    fully integrated into Britain.  Although he accepted that the judge had
    correctly relied on the principles in Devaseelan he had not taken  into
    account the fact that the First-tier Judge had stated at the end of his
    determination that should the appellant commit any further offence that
    would lead to a further  decision  and  the  judge  had  therefore,  he
    argued, not taken into account the further offences.  He  accepted  the
    fact  that  the  appellant  had  not  received  any  further  custodial
    sentences but had stated that he had not considered the changes in  the
    law.

15.  Mr Walker did however accept that the judge had given  a  thorough  and
    detailed analysis of the provisions of paragraphs 398 and  399  of  the
    Rules.  He also stated that  he  accepted  that  Judge  Dineen  had  in
    paragraphs 18 onwards of the determination  reached  conclusions  which
    were open to him when he considered the provisions of the Rules.

16.  He also accepted that where the First-tier Tribunal had found that  the
    appellant was exercising private life there is nothing to suggest  that
    he was no longer doing so nor indeed was there any evidence to  suggest
    that he was no longer socially and culturally integrated.

17.  Mr Rene pointed out that in paragraph 36 of the letter  of  refusal  it
    was said that the appellant was socially and culturally integrated into
    Britain.  He also pointed out that in paragraph 6 of the decision where
    it was stated that the appellant had attended  an  appointment  at  the
    Post Office on 6 February 2014 when his biometric  was  submitted  that
    "this process could not be completed due to  an  administrative  issue"
    which indicated that  the  respondent  was  quite  clearly  considering
    granting further leave to remain at that stage - at that time of course
    the appellant's convictions from 2012 were extant.  He stated that  the
    reality was that it was merely a disagreement  with  the  findings  and
    conclusions which the judge was entitled to make on the evidence before
    him.

Discussion

18.  I consider that the determination of Judge Dineen is both detailed  and
    thorough.

19.  It is incorrect to suggest that he had not taken into  account  changes
    in legislation.  It is clear  that  he  did  apply  the  provisions  of
    paragraphs 398 and 399 of the Immigration Rules.  I note moreover  that
    Mr Walker did not seek to argue that there was any error of law in  his
    not specifically referring to the provisions of  Section  117C  of  the
    2002 Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act.  Moreover I consider that
    Judge Dineen's findings of fact were fully open to him both with regard
    to the fact that the appellant had remained  lawfully  in  Britain  but
    also with regard to the fact that he was fully integrated here and that
    there would be very considerable obstacles to his relocating to  Angola
    - a country which he left at the age of 2 or 3 and would have no memory
    of and whose language he did not speak let alone the other  factors  to
    which Judge Dineen referred in paragraph 23 of the  determination  when
    he quoted from the determination of Judge Davies at paragraph 69 of the
    first determination.

20.  It is clear that Judge Dineen had read and  considered  the  letter  of
    refusal. The fact that he did not  specifically  refer  to  it  is  not
    material: the passage to which he  referred  in  the  determination  of
    Judge Davies dealt clearly with the  issues  on  which  the  respondent
    focused in the letter of refusal. Judge Dineen was  entitled  to  adopt
    those findings and was,  of  course,  required  to  follow  them  as  a
    starting point in his determination. The letter  of  refusal  does  not
    point to any change in circumstances since the first determination.   I
    would add that, following the judgement of Carnwarth  LJ  in  paragraph
    40 of his judgment in Mukarkar  [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1045   it  would  be
    inappropriate  for me to overturn   a determination in  the  First-tier
    which has been  reached  after a proper consideration of the facts  and
    law in this case. The reality is that the First-tier  Judge  who  heard
    the evidence was the person best placed to determine the issues in this
    appeal.  I can only conclude that there is no material error of law  in
    the determination of Judge Dineen and that his  determination  allowing
    this appeal shall stand.
