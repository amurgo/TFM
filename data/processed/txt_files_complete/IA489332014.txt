                                 NOUMAN ARIF

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr A. McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:     Ms N. Bull of counsel, instructed by Whitefield,
solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. Mr Arif, who is a citizen of Pakistan born on 15 May 1989, arrived  in
      the United Kingdom in February 2011 and was admitted as a student with
      leave to remain that was subsequently extended until 14  August  2014.
      Shortly before that leave expired, on  23  July  2014,  the  appellant
      submitted an application for leave to remain as the spouse of a person
      present and settled in  the  United  Kingdom.   He  described  in  his
      application form how he had been married to Ms Amen Javed  on  3  July
      2014 when an "Asian Wedding" had taken place. It is not in doubt  that
      this is a genuine and subsisting relationship. Ms  Javed  was  herself
      born in Pakistan, but moved to the United Kingdom  14  years  ago.  It
      appears that she has dual  British  /  Pakistani  nationality  and  is
      fluent in both English and Urdu.


   2. By a decision dated 21 November 2014 the application was refused. That
      was because it was not accepted that Mr Arif  had  met  the  financial
      requirements of the rules. Although Ms Javed was, at the date  of  the
      application, employed with an income payable at a rate  in  excess  of
      the annual income requirement of �18,600, as that employment commenced
      as recently as 1 July 2014, shorty before the application was made, it
      had not been demonstrated that the annual income requirement had  been
      met. Indeed, the respondent pointed out that, for the purpose  of  the
      immigration rules, her income for the  previous  12  months  was  only
      �999.99, that being the amount paid into her  bank  account,  although
      gross earnings were said to be �1,080.

   3. By a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge McGinty promulgated  on  16
      March 2015 Mr Arif's appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  was  allowed.
      The key facts were as set out above. The judge  understood  it  to  be
      common ground and agreed between the parties that because Ms Javed had
      not worked for her employer for at least  six  months  therefore,  the
      financial requirements of the rules were  met  by  her  producing  the
      payslips and other evidence of her recently obtained  employment  that
      she was in fact able to demonstrate because it was thereby established
      that, at the date of the application, she was in  salaried  employment
      in respect of which her gross annual  income  was  in  excess  of  the
      �18,600 demanded by the immigration rules. Indeed, he recorded in  his
      determination, at paragraph 9, that "a concession" to that effect  had
      been made by the SSHD. Because the judge thought  that  there  was  no
      dispute between the parties, despite the reasons that had  been  given
      for refusing  the  application,  his  decision  is  a  short  one.  It
      concludes by saying, although it should be noted that the reference to
      the appellant's income is in error because  the  judge  was  concerned
      with the income of his spouse:


           "The fact that the appellant    had not in fact earned  in  that
           year a total of �18,600 in her  new  job  by  the  date  of  her
           application is not relevant. What is required is simply that she
           has a job with an annual income of �18,600 gross as at the  date
           of application, and  has  supplied  the  requisite  evidence  in
           respect thereof. That  she  had  done.  The  decision  made  was
           therefore not  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration  Rules.  I
           therefore allow the appeal."

   4. The SSHD has been granted permission to appeal on the basis  that  the
      judge had clearly misunderstood the requirements of the rules.  Whilst
      it is, of course, correct to say that the sponsor  could  not  produce
      evidence of at least six months pay slips if  she  had  not  held  the
      employment for that period of time, the Secretary of  State  says  the
      judge needed to go on  to  make  findings  of  fact  on  any  previous
      earnings, in order to arrive at a figure for her earnings for  the  12
      months prior to the date of the application.


   5. For the reasons that follow, it is unambiguously clear that the  judge
      was wrong to allow the appeal on the basis that he did.

   6. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to remain as  the
      partner of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom are  set
      out in Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules. As  is
      frequently  found  to  be  the  case  when  navigating   through   the
      immigration rules, the journey is a somewhat convoluted one  but  must
      be completed if the correct destination is to be reached.


   7. Appendix FM R-LTRP 1.1 requires that the applicant must  meet  all  of
      the requirements of Section E-LTRP: Eligibility for leave to remain as
      a partner. One of those  requirements,  in  E-LTRP  3.1  is  that  the
      applicant must provide specified evidence of a gross annual income  of
      at least �18,600.


   8. Appendix FM-SE sets out the specified evidence that must  be  provided
      at the date of the application to establish that which is required  by
      Appendix FM. Appendix FM-SE opens with this statement:


           "This Appendix sets out the specified evidence  applicants  need
           to provide to  meet  the  requirements  of  rules  contained  in
           Appendix FM...."


   9. It will be seen that the immigration rules distinguish  between  those
      who can  provide  specified  evidence  of  having  been  in  the  same
      employment for at least 6 months with a  gross  annual  income  of  at
      least �18,600 and those who, although earning an income at that level,
      have been in  the  same  employment  for  less  than  6  months.  This
      distinction first  emerges  at  paragraph  2  of  FM-SE  which  having
      provided that the applicant must meet:


        a) The level of financial requirement applicable to the application
           under Appendix FM; and
        b) The requirements specified in Appendix FM and this  Appendix  as
           to:
              i) The permitted sources of income and savings;
              (ii) The time periods and permitted combinations  of  sources
              applicable to each permitted source relied upon; and
              (iii)The evidence required for each permitted  source  relied
              upon.
           ...

      Continues:
           2. In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where
           paragraph 9 applies), all of the following evidence must be
           provided:
                 (a) Payslips covering:
                       (i) a period of 6 months prior to the date of
                       application if the person has been employed by their
                       current employer for at least 6 months (and where
                       paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix does not apply); or
                       (ii) any period of salaried employment in the period
                       of 12 months prior to the date of application if the
                       person has been employed by their current employer
                       for less than 6 months (or at least 6 months but the
                       person does not rely on paragraph 13(a) of this
                       Appendix), or in the financial year(s) relied upon by
                       a self-employed person.

  10. This is reinforced at paragraph 13:

      Calculating Gross Annual Income under Appendix FM

        13. Based on evidence that meets the requirements of this Appendix,
        and can be taken into account with reference to the applicable
        provisions of Appendix FM, gross annual income under paragraphs E-
        ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1., E-ECC.2.1. and E-LTRC.2.1. will be
        calculated in the following ways:
              (a) Where the person is in salaried employment in the UK at
              the date of application, has been employed by their current
              employer for at least 6 months and has been paid throughout
              the period of 6 months prior to the date of application at a
              level of gross annual salary which equals or exceeds the
              level relied upon in paragraph 13(a)(i), their gross annual
              income will be (where paragraph 13(b) does not apply) the
              total of:
                    (i) The level of gross annual salary relied upon in the
                    application;
                    (ii) The gross amount of any specified non-employment
                    income (other than pension income) received by them or
                    their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of
                    application; and
                    (iii) The gross annual income from a UK or foreign State
                    pension or a private pension received by them or their
                    partner.
              (b) Where the person is in salaried employment in the UK at
              the date of application and has been employed by their
              current employer for less than 6 months (or at least 6 months
              but the person does not rely on paragraph 13(a)), their gross
              annual income will be the total of:
                    (i) The gross annual salary from employment as it was at
                    the date of application;
                    (ii) The gross amount of any specified non-employment
                    income (other than pension income) received by them or
                    their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of
                    application; and
                    (iii) The gross annual income from a UK or foreign State
                    pension or a private pension received by them or their
                    partner. In addition, the requirements of paragraph 15
                    must be met.

  11. For the appellant, Ms Bull submits that the effect of these provisions
      is that all that is required of  the  appellant  is  that  his  spouse
      demonstrates that at the date of the application she was in employment
      in respect of which she was being paid at a  level  equivalent  to  an
      annual gross income of at least �18,600.  If  that  is  all  that  the
      immigration rules required then she would be correct. The  requirement
      of this  provision  is  that  the  person  concerned  is  in  salaried
      employment at the required annual level of remuneration, as  evidenced
      by such payslips as she is able to produce. Similarly,  a  person  who
      has been in employment for more than 6 months does not need to produce
      payslips for the whole year  and  nor  does  such  a  person  have  to
      demonstrate receipt of at least �18,600 in the last 12  months.  Thus,
      what is required is that the person concerned is being paid at a level
      equivalent to an annual gross income of �18,600, not that  he  or  she
      had actually received such an annual income in any 12 month period.


  12. However, that is not all that is required in respect of a  person  who
      has been in the employment relied upon for less than  six  months.  In
      respect of such a person there is an additional requirement that  does
      not need to be met by applicants who have been in the same  employment
      for at least six months at the required income level. This  additional
      requirement is found at paragraph 15 of FM-SE:


           15. In respect of paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 13(d), the
           provisions in this paragraph also apply:
                 (a) In order to evidence the level of gross annual income
                 required by Appendix FM, the person must meet the
                 requirements in paragraph 13(b) or paragraph 13(d)(i); and
                 (b) The person must also meet the level of gross annual
                 income required by Appendix FM on the basis that their
                 income is the total of:
                       (i) The gross income from salaried employment in the
                       UK or overseas earned by the person in the 12 months
                       prior to the date of application;
                       (ii) The gross amount of any specified non-employment
                       income (other than pension income) received by the
                       person or their partner in the 12 months prior to the
                       date of application;
                       (iii) The gross amount received from a UK or foreign
                       State pension or a private pension by the person or
                       their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of
                       application; and
                       (iv)The person cannot combine the gross annual income
                       at paragraph 15(b)(i)-(iii) with specified savings in
                       order to meet the level of income required.




  13. This echoes the approach set out in the relevant IDI  which  explains,
      at paragraph 5.3.3 that for a person who has been  in  the  qualifying
      employment for less than 6 months:


           "... the financial requirement must be met and evidenced in  two
           parts."


      The first "part" is the level of gross annual salary as at the date of
      the application, but:


           "Second, the person must in addition have  received  in  the  12
           months prior to the date of  application  the  level  of  income
           required to meet the financial requirements...."


  14. It can be  seen  from  this  that  a  person  who  cannot  demonstrate
      qualifying employment for at least six months with the  same  employer
      must demonstrate that the required sum has been  "earned"  during  the
      preceding twelve months.  The  rationale  for  the  distinction  drawn
      between  those  who  have  and  have  not  held  a  single  qualifying
      employment for at least six months is  not  hard  to  understand.  The
      respondent is prepared to accept that a person who has held  the  same
      employment for at least six months at  a  gross  annual  income  at  a
      qualifying level has demonstrated that the employment  is  sustainable
      such that no more than that is required to be demonstrated in order to
      satisfy a minimum annual income requirement. However, where  a  person
      has been employed for  a  shorter  period  the  employment  cannot  be
      assumed to be sustainable and so, in order to meet  the  same  minimum
      income requirement it is necessary to demonstrate that by pointing  to
      earnings actually received in the preceding twelve months.


  15. It follows from this that the judge fell into legal error in  allowing
      the appeal for the reasons he did. That error is material because,  in
      the absence of  findings  of  fact  concerning  any  earnings  in  the
      preceding twelve months I cannot be sure that the outcome  would  have
      been the same but for  that  error.  The  appellant  had  raised  also
      grounds founded upon rights protected by article 8  of  the  ECHR  and
      paragraph 276ADE which the judge  did  not  consider.  Therefore,  the
      appeal must be determined afresh.


      Summary of decision:


  16. First-tier Tribunal Judge McGinty made a material error of law and his
      decision to allow the appeal is set aside.


  17. The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal  is  allowed  to
      the extent that the appeal is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  to
      be determined afresh on all grounds raised.
