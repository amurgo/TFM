                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     None (Focus Immigration Solicitors no longer
instructed)
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 1st October 1972  and  he
    appeals against a decision of the respondent to refuse to grant him  an
    EEA residence card as confirmation of a right of residence in the UK as
    a family member of a qualified EEA national.  The respondent's decision
    was made on 8th July 2013.  The appellant states that he is married  to
    Ms Cherise Marya Wittenberg a Dutch national.

 2. The respondent noted that the EEA national sponsor was said to be self-
    employed.  There were bank statements for the period between  6th  June
    2012 and 5th September 2012 and a national insurance contribution  bill
    of 31st March 2012 and a self-assessment tax calculation with a receipt
    for 2011 to 2012.  The  appellant  had  failed  to  provide  sufficient
    evidence of the EEA national spouse's  economic  activity  in  the  UK.
    sufficient  evidence.   There  were  no  recent  invoices,  statements,
    audited accounts business bank statements and no advertisements of  the
    said EEA national's company.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Reed determined the appeal on the papers  and
    dismissed the appeal on  both  EEA  Regulations  and  on  human  rights
    grounds.

 4. Application for permission to appeal was made by the appellant  on  the
    grounds that the judge ignored evidence such as  the  advertisement  of
    the appellant's sponsor's business, business  cards,  bank  statements,
    invoices and evidence of NI contributions and profit and loss accounts,
    evidence of filing tax returns and an accountant's letter.

 5. The judge erred it was asserted when he did not  accept  the  HMRC  tax
    documents.  The appellant's sponsor made a  tax  declaration  from  her
    active business.  Self-employed people are permitted  to  receive  cash
    and it is just that they must properly account for the money  received.



 6. The judge further erred in law when he stated that an average of �83.20
    per week income by the appellant's sponsor for her business  was  on  a
    small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Simpson as  the
    judge had arguably applied an incorrect standard of proof and  that  he
    had introduced value judgments as  to  the  benefit  of  the  sponsor's
    economic activity.

The Hearing

 8. The appellant did not attend the hearing.  On the  file  was  a  notice
    dated 5th June 2014 to Mr  Jude  Asoya  the  appellant  care  of  Focus
    Immigration Services, Fortis House, 160  London  Road,  Barking,  Essex
    IG11 8BB.  I note that further to The Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules 2005 Rule 56 every party and any person  representing
    a party must notify the Tribunal in writing of the  postal  address  at
    which documents may be served  on  him  and  of  any  changes  to  that
    address.  In the  notice  of  appeal  the  appellant  only  gave  Focus
    Immigration Solicitors details, even in the personal  address  section,
    and failed to notify the Tribunal of any change of address.

 9. Further to Rule 38 of the Upper Tribunal  Procedure  Rules  2008  if  a
    party fails to attend a hearing the Upper  Tribunal  may  proceed  with
    that hearing if the Upper Tribunal

      a) is satisfied that the party has been notified  of  the  hearing  or
         that reasonable steps have been taken to notify the  party  of  the
         hearing, and

      b) considered that it is in the interests of justice to  proceed  with
         that hearing.

10. By letter dated 8th July 2014 Focus Immigration Solicitors stated

         "We write to inform the Tribunal that we  no  longer  act  for  the
         above named person with respect to  his  pending  appeal  with  the
         Tribunal.

         This is due to the fact the appellant  has  withdrawn  instructions
         from our office.

         In view of the above, kindly remove our details from your system as
         the appellant will get in touch with the Tribunal."

11. Not only is the appellant under  a  duty  to  inform  the  Tribunal  of
    address for  service  but  also  this  letter  from  Focus  Immigration
    Solicitors indicates that the appellant was aware that he had a pending
    appeal and needed to be in touch with the Tribunal Service for  details
    of his pending appeal hearing date.

12. I therefore find that as the only address given by the appellant to the
    Tribunal service was that of Focus Immigration  Solicitors,  reasonable
    steps have been taken to notify the appellant of the hearing  and  that
    in accordance with the overriding objective it is in the  interests  of
    justice to proceed with the  hearing.   A  further  delay  would  cause
    further expense and I found the appellant had had ample time to  notify
    the Tribunal of any further evidence or submissions he wishes to make.

13. I turn to the consideration of  the  grounds  of  the  application  for
    permission  to  appeal  and  note  that  the  grounds  state  that  the
    Immigration Judge  ignored  pieces  of  admissible  evidence  like  the
    advertisement of the appellant's sponsor's  business,  business  cards,
    bank statements, invoices, evidence of  NI  contributions,  profit  and
    loss accounts, evidence of filing tax returns and accountant's letters.

14. The determination of Judge Reed referred in paragraph 13 to the class 2
    national insurance contributions.  Judge Reed also referred to the  tax
    documentation for the year ended 6th April 2012 and the tax calculation
    at paragraph 13.

15. At paragraph 14 the judge referred to the set of trading  accounts  for
    the period ending 2nd November 2013, to the supporting letter from  the
    firm called Emerald Enterprise Solutions regarding the accounts and  at
    paragraph 17 the  judge  referred  to  the  handwritten  receipts.   At
    paragraph 18 the judge referred to the photocopied  business  card  and
    the advertisement on the internet.

16. The judge addressed each piece of evidence in turn and gave reasons why
    the judge rejected that evidence.

17. The judge referred to the HMRC tax documentation at  paragraph  13  and
    rejected the national insurance contribution on the basis that this was
    declared by the sponsor and the  judge  specifically  stated  that  she
    rejected this because there was nothing to show that the figures relied
    on  by  HMRC  were  anything  other  than  just  declarations  by   the
    appellant's sponsor.

18. It is clear that the judge considered the evidence  in  the  round  and
    found against the trading accounts which were drawn up in  relation  to
    more than one calendar year.

19. As the judge stated he was left to consider the documents  without  any
    clear narrative from the appellant, paragraph 12.

20. The judge at paragraph 16 of  the  determination  considered  the  bank
    statements and specifically stated

         "There are various transactions and cash deposits but it is unclear
         where any of this money has come from.  In the absence of  a  clear
         indication as where any deposits paid into the  account  have  come
         from, this evidence does little to assist  the  appellant  in  this
         appeal."

21. At paragraph 17 the judge dismissed the handwritten receipts because of
    the unsystematic way in which it was recorded and the judge stated

         "I do not accept that someone operating a business  would  just  be
         left with a series of torn out receipts as it would be too easy for
         these to become lost.  This evidence has every appearance of having
         been contrived for the purposes of this appeal."

22. The judge stated at paragraph 17 "In all circumstances I attach  little
    weight to this evidence as demonstrating that the sponsor is running  a
    business as claimed."

23. In relation to the assertion that the judge erred  by  not  considering
    the fact that self-employed people are  allowed  to  receive  cash  the
    judge took account of the evidence as a whole and there appeared to  be
    no attempt by  the  appellant  to  relate  the  cash  deposits  to  any
    invoices.  The judge stated that he was left to consider the  documents
    without any clear narrative.

24. I am not persuaded that the judge was setting an  unreasonably  high  a
    standard of proof for a hairdressing business which  was  characterised
    by exchange of cash and indeed at paragraph 19 the judge  states  quite
    clearly "I have considered all of the evidence with care but  find  the
    appellant has failed to demonstrate on  the  balance  of  probabilities
    that his EEA national  sponsor  is  indeed  genuinely  a  self-employed
    person as is claimed."

25. At paragraph 15 the judge states

         "It is also significant that even if I were to take the figures  in
         these accounts at face value (which I do not) over  the  course  of
         the 56 weeks or so of this profit the net  profit  shown  in  these
         accounts would appear to equate to somewhere in the region of  only
         �83.20 per week."





26. The judge considered this to be marginal.

27. Further to Begum (EEA - worker - jobseeker) Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  275
    (IAC) a person who does not pursue effective and genuine activities  or
    pursues activities on such a small scale as to be  regarded  as  purely
    marginal and ancillary or which have no economic value to  an  employer
    is not a worker.

28. It was the judge's view that the documentation presented to him did not
    reflect genuine activities, which in turn undermined  the  findings  on
    any income, and also that the activity was on such a small scale as  to
    be regarded as marginal.

29. I found the grounds of appeal merely to  be  a  disagreement  with  the
    judge's findings, which are supported by adequate reasoning,  and  when
    read as a whole in the determination are sound.

30. I therefore find that the determination contains no error  of  law  and
    should stand.  Appeal dismissed.
