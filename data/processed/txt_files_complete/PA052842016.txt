Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of Abdulwakil Ghnizada, a citizen of Afghanistan born
   3 January 1967, against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  5
   January 2017 to dismiss his appeal on  asylum  grounds,  itself  brought
   against the decision of the Respondent of 10  May  2016  to  refuse  him
   asylum.


2. The Appellant's asylum claim is summarised in the decision of the First-
   tier Tribunal. He is a Dari speaking Afghan of Tajik ethnicity. It seems
   he was originally present in the UK in 2004  in  the  name  Abdul  Wakil
   Majidi, and claimed asylum, his application being refused and an  appeal
   being dismissed in his absence. He was  granted  entry  clearance  as  a
   spouse following earlier refusals of such an application, succeeding  in
   a second round of appeal proceedings, arriving  in  November  2011,  and
   living with his British citizen spouse S S. He  applied  for  indefinite
   leave to remain as a spouse; that application was  refused  on  10  June
   2014, Ms S S by now having written to the Respondent  to  say  that  the
   marriage had permanently broken down. He then made  an  application  for
   leave to remain on domestic violence grounds, but  the  application  was
   refused and an appeal failed, because it was found that  the  chronology
   of alleged violence post-dated the relationship's breakdown.


3. The Appellant claimed asylum on 1 November 2015, explaining that all his
   family now lived abroad.  Many  years  ago  he  had  performed  military
   service in Afghanistan, fighting against the Mujahadeen,  working  as  a
   signaller; when the time came for his military service to  end,  he  was
   not released from military service, and eventually took matters into his
   own hands, escaping back to the family home in Kabul and then travelling
   on to take refuge in Pakistan. Following his arrival  in  the  UK,  from
   2012 he had worked for Mabway, a company retained by the British Army to
   facilitate role-playing  exercises  in  Afghanistan.  He  believed  that
   history`s work for the British forces would put him at  risk  on  return
   given he had played the role of military and police officers  in  videos
   that were at least similar to some that had appeared on Youtube, and his
   brother had received a letter from the Taliban threatening the Appellant
   because of his work for the armed forces here. It was that  letter  that
   promoted his asylum claim.


4.  The  Home  Office  refused  his  application,  whilst   accepting   his
   conscription in to the Afghan Army and work for  Medway.  They  did  not
   accept the veracity of the threats he claimed to have received from  the
   Taliban.


5. The First-tier Tribunal found the Appellant's claim to lack credibility,
   because


     a. His asylum claim was made suspiciously late notwithstanding his
        repeated prior contact with the UK authorities, bearing in mind
        that he had referenced threats in 2014 as well as 2015;
     b. His evidence had been found wanting in previous appeal proceedings;


     c. He had previously lived in Afghanistan without incident, for
        example owning a shop in Kabul and working in his father's
        restaurant from around 2005 to 2011;
     d. There was no evidence that his work for Mabway would have come to
        the attention of the Taliban such that he would be recognisable and
        in danger on a return;
     e. His evidence that the existence of the letter from the Taliban of 9
        November 2015 had come to his attention around three months before
        his asylum claim was inconsistent with the fact he claimed asylum
        only around 10 days after its stated date; and his account of the
        letter's delivery was vague, and he had variously referred to
        "threats" and a single threat;
     f. His evidence as to his brother's receipt of a death threat was
        undermined by his continuing to work for the same company for a
        year after it was made, and he had provided no evidence that his
        brother worked for a German NGO.

6. Somewhat  diffuse  grounds  of  appeal  contended  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal erred in law in what amounts to three ways:


     a. Relying on adverse credibility findings in earlier appeal
        proceedings which did not take account of the Appellant's
        subsequent success at appeal following the hearing before Judge
        Woolf who accepted that his identity and marriage were genuine;
     b. Overlooking the fact that it was the further threat made to his
        brother by way of a letter that led to the Appellant's asylum claim
        in November 2015 before which time the Appellant had no reason to
        claim asylum;
     c. Making material errors of fact, for example misrecording, possibly
        due to an error by the Tribunal interpreter, the Appellant's
        evidence: the Appellant would not have said that he claimed asylum
        three months after learning of the letter to his brother, given it
        was central to his case that his claim post-dated the letter by
        only three weeks afterwards; there was no reference to threats
        being received in 2014 in the interview record.



7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Hollingworth on the basis that
   it appeared that there was no evidence regarding threats in  2014  which
   cast doubt on the First-tier Tribunal's  approach  generally  given  the
   primary weight afforded to issues such as the timing of the  Appellant's
   asylum claim, and that excessive weight had been given to the absence of
   documentary evidence in the context of the Appellant's work  for  Mabway
   given the role he clearly played for them.


8. Before me Mr Choda put forward arguments consistently with  the  grounds
   of appeal. The Appellant's credibility on his marriage  application  had
   been vindicated by Judge Woolf on appeal and so should not have  clouded
   the approach to his present asylum claim. There was no  reason  for  the
   Appellant to deviate from his consistent evidence that the letter to his
   brother had been received in November 2015.


9. For the Respondent Mr Naith submitted that the decision as a whole could
   stand. The reference to threats materialising in 2014 may  have  been  a
   slip, but was not a significant error given the numerous  other  reasons
   given for disbelieving the Appellant.

Findings and reasons


10. Permission to appeal was granted on all the grounds. I  have  sought  to
   identify the salient points from the grounds of appeal.


11. The First-tier Tribunal made a fully reasoned  decision  with  which  it
   plainly took care. Nevertheless that does not  necessarily  immunise  it
   from the presence of legal error:  asylum  appeals  must  be  approached
   applying the appropriate anxious scrutiny, and as Carnwath LJ  explained
   in YH  [2010] EWCA Civ 116 that term  "has  by  usage  acquired  special
   significance as underlining the very special human context in which such
   cases are brought, and the need for decisions to show by their reasoning
   that every factor which might tell in favour of an  applicant  has  been
   properly taken into account."


12. The Appellant's involvement with Mabway is undisputed. There can  be  no
   doubt that were such activities to come to the attention of the Taliban,
   he might be at risk, at least in some parts of Afghanistan. This  appeal
   primarily turns, however, on  whether  or  not  he  has  come  to  their
   attention.


13. The First-tier Tribunal took  account  of  the  Appellant's  immigration
   history. It is true, as submitted by Mr Choda, that  the  Appellant  was
   ultimately vindicated on appeal following his application to  enter  the
   UK as a spouse. It is also true that he pursued an asylum claim that was
   without foundation. That may very well have been on grounds  unconnected
   to his present asserted  fear  of  persecution:  neither  side  has  put
   forward evidence on the issue. However the fact that on that occasion he
   failed to  attend  his  own  appeal  hearing  does  not  give  one  much
   confidence in his  own  assessment  of  his  case's  prospects,  and  he
   apparently pursued that application in a different name to that  he  now
   puts forward. He has also pursued an unsuccessful application to  remain
   on domestic violence  grounds.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal was entitled to find that his immigration history was  at  best
   mixed. It was astute to direct itself that the consideration  identified
   in section 8 of the Asylum  and  Immigration  (Treatment  of  Claimants,
   etc.) Act 2004 would be no answer to an otherwise well founded claim.


14. The timing of the Appellant's asylum claim clearly weighed heavily  with
   the First-tier Tribunal, aside from the question of immigration history.
   It considered that he had given conflicting information as to  when  his
   brother had first received the letter from the Taliban threatening  him.
   Although it may well be right that he never gave a  2014  date  for  the
   first eventuation of the threats during  his  interview  with  the  Home
   Office, at the hearing he is recorded as having stated that  there  were
   problems in 2014 and 2015 during cross examination. Given  that  he  was
   also criticised by the First-tier Tribunal for admitting that he had not
   considered it necessary to "look thoroughly" for online corroboration of
   Mabway activities, I consider that it was open to the fact-finding judge
   to come to the conclusion he did on this point.


15. As to the issue surrounding  whether  the  interpreter  at  the  hearing
   below may have been responsible for some degree of confusion, there  was
   no contemporaneous criticism of interpretation  raised  at  the  hearing
   below; tellingly, the Appellant was not called  for  re-examination,  as
   would have been expected had his answers as given at  the  hearing  been
   considered inconsistent by his advocate with the case he was seeking  to
   put.


16. Detailed  reasons  are  provided  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  its
   decision. It seems to me that this is an appeal where the  enjoinder  in
   Piglowska v Piglowski [1999] 1 WLR 1360  (endorsed  in  the  immigration
   context in EA [2017] EWCA Civ 10 �27) is relevant:  "reasons  should  be
   read on the assumption that, unless he has  demonstrated  the  contrary,
   the judge knew how he should perform his functions and which matters  he
   should take into account ... [an]  appellate  court  should  resist  the
   temptation to subvert the principle  that  they  should  not  substitute
   their own discretion for that of the judge by a narrow textual  analysis
   which enables them to claim that he misdirected himself".


17. I accordingly conclude that the reasoning  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   was properly open to it and I dismiss the appeal.

          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  contain  a  material
    error of law.
    The appeal is dismissed.
