                             SARADO ELMI SHARIF
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. In this case permission was granted partly on the basis that Judge  Fox
    in the First-tier Tribunal said  that  there  were  "no  new  documents
    before me" whereas the appellant's  representative,  a  solicitor,  had
    produced a 223-page bundle at the hearing, with a  considerable  number
    of important post-decision documents.

 2. Following the grant of  permission,  Stefan  Kotas  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State has indicated his  view  that  if  that  is  so  the
    failure to have regard to it was "arguably procedurally unfair,  albeit
    through no fault of the judge".  I agree with the first element of that
    opinion, but not with the second.

 3. Mr Kotas invites the Upper Tribunal to consider whether it is satisfied
    that the material was before Judge Fox and, if so, to remit the appeal.
     I am so satisfied.  I set aside Judge Fox's decision for error of law.
     I remit the appeal for fresh determination by the First-tier Tribunal.
