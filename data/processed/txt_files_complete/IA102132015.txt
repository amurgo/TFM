                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Majid)  who,  in   a   determination
    promulgated on  1st  October  2015,  allowed  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse her application for  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant under the Immigration Rules (HC  395  (as
    amended)).

 2. Whilst the Appellant is the Secretary of State, for ease of reference I
    intend to refer to the parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 3. The immigration history of the Appellant can be  stated  briefly.   The
    Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom  on  25th  November  2008  with
    entry clearance as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant and was granted leave  to
    enter until 7th November 2011.  On 6th November 2011, she submitted  an
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 1  Migrant  and  was  granted
    leave to remain until 21st August 2014.

 4. On 21st August 2014 the Appellant made an  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier  1  (General)  Migrant.
    The application was considered by the  Secretary  of  State  and  in  a
    notice of decision of 30th January 2015 the Secretary of State  refused
    that application and a decision was made to refuse  to  very  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom and to remove by way of  directions  under
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 5. The reasons for that decision are set out in the  accompanying  reasons
    for refusal letter of the same date.  As the applicant was applying for
    indefinite leave to remain as a Tier  1  (General)  Migrant,  paragraph
    245CD applied.  At paragraph 245CD[h] the  Appellant  was  required  to
    have sufficient  knowledge  of  the  English  language  and  sufficient
    knowledge about life in the United Kingdom, in accordance with Appendix
    KoLL of the Rules unless the applicant could meet the conditions in [f]
    and [i]-[iii] which provide for  an  exemption.   As  set  out  in  the
    decision letter, the applicant was required to  demonstrate  sufficient
    knowledge about life in the United Kingdom that was to be  demonstrated
    if the applicant had passed the test known as the "Life in the UK test"
    administered by Learn Direct Limited.  The decision letter stated  that
    the Appellant had not provided any evidence that she  had  passed  that
    test or that she should be exempted from the requirement therefore  she
    had not satisfied the requirements of paragraph 245CD[h].

 6. At paragraph [6] of the reasons for refusal letter, it  made  reference
    to Article 8 but noting that whilst it was implied in  the  application
    that she wished to rely on family and private life established  in  the
    United Kingdom under Article 8 of the ECHR, if an application was to be
    considered by the Secretary of State, it must be  made  in  a  separate
    application.  Thus the application was refused.

 7. Following the refusal the Appellant filed Grounds of Appeal under cover
    of letter of  13th  March  2015  which  included  a  witness  statement
    referring to the late submission of the appeal  and  formulaic  grounds
    making reference to the decision  not  being  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules and also raising Article 8 of the ECHR.

 8. Three days before the hearing on 18th September 2015 an  appeal  bundle
    was provided which included a witness statement of the Appellant,  copy
    of the Appellant's Life in the UK  pass  notification  and  documentary
    evidence about her university degree.

 9. In a decision promulgated on 1st October 2015 Judge Majid  allowed  the
    appeal.  The reasons given for allowing  the  appeal  are  set  out  at
    paragraphs [10]-[18] which records as follows:-

         "10. In this decision I am confining my reasons to the  dispositive
             aspects of the case.  I have carefully perused the Appellant's
             statement of 18th September 2015 and the  other  documents  to
             reach my decision.  Ms Shaw, very helpfully, conducted an oral
             examination of the Appellant in which  she  said  'I  was  not
             advised by any lawyer.  I went to the Home Office website  and
             did not tick the correct section of the form;  now  I  believe
             that I should have ticked the section asking for ILR because I
             am entitled to that due to my relevant  lawful  time  in  this
             country.'

          11. Mr Staunton drew my attention to the reasons  in  the  refusal
             letter of 30th January 2015 and  invited  me  to  dismiss  the
             appeal.

          12. Ms Shaw said that the appeal should  be  allowed  because  the
             Appellant had made a genuine mistake.  Also one should bear in
             mind that she is not only entitled to remain in  this  country
             with the type of status of ILR under the relevant  Immigration
             Rules.

          13. I am grateful to Ms Shaw for pointing out the fact that due to
             lack of sound advice the Appellant had made a mistake, ticking
             the wrong section.  However, as it is clear  from  looking  at
             the  form,  the  Appellant  changed  it  by  tipex.   Ms  Shaw
             indicated that an alternative route for the grant  of  ILR  is
             also available to  this  Appellant  as  at  the  date  of  the
             hearing.  Further, the Appellant  was  not  a  burden  on  the
             public funds since she was earning about ï¿½40,000 a year.

          14. I must say that the 'rule of law' demands that a person should
             be able to benefit from the ECHR as long as the UK  remains  a
             party to that Convention.  Furthermore it should be remembered
             that again and again judges are  told  that  the  new  changes
             automatically take into account the considerations relevant to
             ECHR.  In this case the Appellant should have the  benefit  of
             discretion and it should be in line with  the  spirit  of  the
             ECHR.

          15. An explanatory Memorandum was submitted by the Home Office  to
             Parliament when it introduced radical and material changes  to
             the Immigration Rules on  9th  July  2012.   Inter  alia  this
             Memorandum said 'The new Immigration  Rules  will  reform  the
             approach taken as a  matter  of  public  policy  towards  ECHR
             Article 8, the right to respect for family and private life in
             immigration cases ...Failure to meet the requirements  of  the
             Rules will normally mean failure to  establish  an  Article  8
             claim.'

          16. I must say that I am conducting an appeal and not  a  judicial
             review and therefore cannot restrict myself  in  conducting  a
             proper evaluation of the evidence on the matters of fact; if a
             factual issue is properly raised  before  the  Respondent  the
             evidence surrounding that  issue  can  always  be  taken  into
             account.  My consideration of this appeal is not  confined  to
             points of 'law'.  Of course, if I am sitting in  an  Appellate
             Court, I would have to be concerned only  with  the  point  of
             'law'.

          17. I am fully conscious of the 'legal requirements' stipulated by
             immigration law.  It is incumbent upon me to advert to the new
             Rules giving respect to  the  animus  legis  dictated  by  the
             supremacy of parliament.  The rule of law  demands  that  this
             appellant should succeed under the Rules.  She is not a burden
             on the public funds and is making a worthwhile contribution to
             the economy of this country as a Highly Skilled Migrant.

          18. In the circumstances, in the view of my deliberations  in  the
             preceding paragraphs and having taken  into  account  all  the
             oral and documentary evidence as well  as  submissions  at  my
             disposal, cognisant of the fact that the burden of proof is on
             the Appellant and the standard of  proof  is  the  balance  of
             probabilities, I am persuaded that the Appellant comes  within
             the relevant immigration law, as amended."

    The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal  that  decision  and
    permission was granted by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Colyer) on 8th
    March 2016.

10. Thus the appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.  Ms Pal relied upon the
    grounds and submitted that there was a  complete  absence  of  findings
    relating to the application made under Tier 1 and that the losing party
    was entitled to understand why they had lost the appeal and that  could
    not be discerned from the determination of the judge concerned.

11.  She referred to  the  refusal  letter  and  the  basis  given  by  the
    Secretary of  State  for  refusing  the  application  namely  paragraph
    245CD[h] and that the judge failed to consider the Rules including  the
    documents required.  She  submitted  that  he  should  have  considered
    whether the Secretary of State had seen the relevant documentation  and
    that if a document had been  missing  or  not  in  the  correct  format
    whether there was an issue under paragraph  245AA  but  none  of  those
    issues featured in the determination and there were no proper  findings
    of fact or reasons given and that the only way it  could  be  corrected
    would be by way of a complete rehearing.

12. Mr Coleman on behalf of the Appellant submitted that it was clear  from
    paragraph 2 of the decision that he had the forefront of his  mind  the
    refusal letter and that he was  aware  of  the  basis  upon  which  the
    application had been refused.  He submitted that it was  not  incumbent
    upon a judge to go into every detail when making an assessment  of  the
    evidence.  He made reference to paragraph 14 that the judge appeared to
    allow the appeal under Article 8 and that she should have  the  benefit
    of the discretion of the ECHR.  He reminded the Tribunal  that  he  had
    considered her oral evidence and written evidence and had  accepted  it
    and therefore found in her favour.

13.  At the conclusion of the submissions, I indicated to the parties  that
    I had reached the conclusion that the decision of Judge Majid disclosed
    material errors of law and that the decision should consequently be set
    aside.  I gave my brief reasons at the hearing and I now give  my  full
    reasons for reaching that view.

14. The decision made by the Secretary of State was set out in the decision
    of 30th January 2015 supported by the reasons for refusal letter namely
    that the Appellant  was  required  under  paragraph  245CD[h]  to  have
    sufficient knowledge of the English language and  sufficient  knowledge
    about Life in the United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with  Appendix  KoLL
    unless the applicant met the conditions which gave  her  an  exemption.
    The refusal went on to  state  that  the  Appellant  had  not  provided
    evidence that she has passed the "life in the  UK  test"  or  that  she
    should be exempt from the requirement that  she  had  not  demonstrated
    that she met the requirements of  paragraph  245CD[h]  of  HC  395  (as
    amended).

15. As the grounds set out, the  judge  made  no  clear  reference  to  the
    decision under challenge under the  Immigration  Rules  and  whilst  Mr
    Coleman submitted that the judge made reference to the  refusal  letter
    and thus the decision at paragraph 2, in my judgment it is  plain  from
    reading the determination as a whole that the judge  wholly  failed  to
    engage with the nature and the contents of the refusal under  paragraph
    245CD[h] and the issue of the failure to provide the relevant  document
    and the Appellant's evidence set out in her witness statement that  she
    had taken the test and passed it six months later in July.

16. Nor does the judge set out how the Appellant was able to establish that
    she had met the Immigration Rules ( if that indeed was the basis of the
    decision to allow the appeal).

17. The judge made reference to the submissions  made  by  the  Appellant's
    representative who appeared to advance her case on the basis  that  the
    appeal should be allowed because she had  made  a  genuine  mistake  in
    ticking the "wrong box" (paragraphs [12] and [13]).  However the  judge
    wholly failed to explain how that would meet the Immigration Rules  and
    on what basis he allowed the appeal.

18. Indeed I accept the submission made by Ms Pal that there is a  complete
    lack of reasoning and it is wholly unclear on what basis he allowed the
    appeal; whether under the Immigration Rules relating to Tier 1 or under
    the Rules relating to Article 8 or outside of the Rules under Article 8
    of the ECHR.  The references made to the ECHR are set out at paragraphs
    [14]-[17] and make reference to  the  Appellant  who  should  have  the
    "benefit of discretion and should be in line with  the  spirit  of  the
    ECHR" (see paragraph [14]). The decision gives the appearance of having
    been allowed on Article 8 grounds.  However if the judge was purporting
    to allow the appeal under  Article  8  outside  of  the  Rules  it  was
    incumbent upon him to say on  what  basis  such  an  application  could
    succeed.

19. Consequently the decision of the judge cannot stand and should  be  set
    aside.

20. As to the remaking of  the  decision,  Mr  Coleman  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant submitted that this was a case in which  the  correct  course
    was for it to be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    hearing to include all matters including the issues of Article  8.   Ms
    Pal was in agreement with this course  as  the  correct  course  to  be
    adopted.  Therefore  the  case  will  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in accordance with Section 12[2][b] of the  Tribunals,  Courts
    and Enforcement and paragraph 7.2 of the  Practice  Statement  of  10th
    February 2010 (as amended).

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made an error of law and the decision is set  aside.
 The appeal is to be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  at  Taylor  House
for a hearing in accordance with Section 12[12][b] of the Tribunals,  Courts
and Enforcement Act and paragraph 7.2 of  the  Practice  Statement  of  10th
February 2010 (as amended).

No anonymity direction is made.
