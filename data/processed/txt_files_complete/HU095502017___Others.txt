Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr A Slatter of Counsel instructed by Paul John &
Co.
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   These linked appeals have come back before me to remake  the  decisions
    in the appeals pursuant to the  'error  of  law'  hearing  held  on  28
    November 2018. The text of the error of law decision and Directions are
    appended hereto, and should  be  read  as  an  integral  part  of  this
    Decision.


2.   It is to be recalled that I determined that the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal was "one of  detail  and  clarity,  and...  save  in  one
    respect is unimpugnable" (paragraph 3 of the error  of  law  decision).
    The issue that led to the decision of the First-tier Tribunal being set
    aside because it was material to an evaluation of the best interests of
    KDU, was that the Judge was misconceived in not  recognising  that  the
    supporting  medical  evidence   suggested   an   ongoing   neurological
    assessment was required: see in particular paragraphs 11, 17,  18,  and
    19 of the error of law decision.


3.   It may also be seen from the error of law decision that there was  some
    discussion as to whether a neurological assessment would be  undertaken
    in the UK,  during  which  the  Appellants'  counsel  referred  to  the
    relevance of such  an  assessment  as  an  aspect  of  evaluating  best
    interests (see the second of the two paragraphs numbered 21).


4.   Pursuant to the foregoing, the Directions were focused on the issue  of
    neurological/neurodevelopmental assessment (paragraph 22).


5.   Since the error of law  hearing  the  Appellants  have  filed  a  small
    additional bundle, including a witness statement dated  19  March  2019
    deposed by the First Appellant. I was  also  provided  with  a  further
    letter dated 15 March 2019 from the  Consultant  Haematologist  at  the
    University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital in Nigeria,  and  an  NHS
    card stating the bearer to be at risk of transfusion-associated  graft-
    versus-host disease ('GVHD').


6.   DSU supplemented her witness statement by way of oral  evidence  before
    me, both in-chief and under cross-examination.


7.   Bearing in mind the basis upon which the error of law  was  found,  and
    the focus of the ensuing discussion and Directions, it is of particular
    note that no neurological assessment has been conducted, and indeed  it
    is now the position that it is not intended that KDU  be  submitted  to
    such a process.


8.   In this latter regard I was told that DSU had spoken to friends in  the
    medical field and had come to understand that such an assessment  would
    require an MRI and other scans to be conducted. DSU did not wish to put
    her daughter through such  processes.  Instead,  it  was  preferred  to
    explore the option of obtaining help through  psychiatric/psychological
    support and/or counselling (see further below). DSU  acknowledged  that
    there was a funding issue given that KDU was no longer entitled to  NHS
    treatment without payment, but said that  in  the  event  she  had  not
    priced the cost of a neurological assessment because the cost  had  not
    been the only reason for deciding not to pursue such an option.


9.     Necessarily   the   fact   that   KDU   is   not   to    undergo    a
    neurological/neurodevelopmental  assessment  -  which  seems   be   the
    position adopted irrespective of geographical location  (i.e.  it  will
    not take place whether she is in the UK or in Nigeria or  elsewhere)  -
    means that there is  not  available  the  sort  of  evidence  that  the
    Appellant's counsel at the error of law hearing anticipated would be of
    assistance in evaluating best interests. Accordingly, in my  judgement,
    all that can be inferred in respect of KDU's neurological and cognitive
    function from the circumstances of the referral for  an  assessment  by
    healthcare professionals in or about 2014 and again in  November  2018,
    is  that  there  has  been  some  concern  as  to  neurological  and/or
    neurodevelopmental deficit  and/or  cognitive  impairment  such  as  to
    warrant an assessment.


10.  As regards the extent of any deficit it seems that  the  best  evidence
    hitherto is that of the psychological assessment report  dated  9  June
    2016: see paragraph 10 of the error of law decision.


11.  In this context  I  note  the  following  in  respect  of  the  further
    evidence that has been filed before the Upper Tribunal:

         (i) Letter dated 31 December 2018 from Consultant  Psychiatrist  Dr
         Lalitha de Silva, based on a consultation on 12 December  2018.  It
         is recorded that DSU reported that KDU "is very slowed down",  "has
         emotional outbursts, and finds interaction with people  difficult",
         and "has also been low  in  mood  and  anxious".  KDU's  sleep  was
         described by her mother as "disturbed", and it was  said  that  she
         'snacked' at odd  times.  School  attendance  was  described  as  a
         regular "but [she] does not interact well  with  others".  Mobility
         was said to be "limited to some extent". DSU also reported that her
         daughter required a lot of help for both her physical problems  and
         emotional problems. However, Dr de Silva also noted that KDU  "gets
         good reports from her teachers". It was also recorded that KDU sang
         with her mother at church, socialised when she was  at  church  and
         was  "comfortable"  within  her  family  and  within   the   church
         community. (I interject to note that I have taken into account  the
         contents of the letter of support dated  14  March  2019  from  the
         Deaconess at Christ  Embassy  church.)  On  examination  KDU  "came
         across as a very  pleasant  girl  [and]  made  good  eye  contact".
         Although she was quiet at the beginning she  later  contributed  to
         the discussion; however, "Her mood appeared to be low and  she  was
         anxious". Dr de Silva opined that KDU "suffers from  mixed  anxiety
         and depression of moderate intensity", adding  the  uncontroversial
         context "she has been very unwell for five years". In  this  latter
         context the treatment in the UK was noted. Dr de Silva  also  noted
         "her schooling has been interrupted and she is slowly  settling  in
         her current school". He then expressed the view that "She  requires
         treatment for emotional  problems,  assessing  and  monitoring  her
         mental state, psychotherapy and maybe medication".  In this  regard
         it was noted that KDU was known to CAMHS, and Dr de Silva  "advised
         her to seek help from CAMHS". Dr de Silva also opined that in light
         of the turmoil in her life, KDU "needs to have  some  stability  in
         her health and also in  her  school  environment  to  help  her  to
         develop herself and recover", adding "Any further upheavals in  her
         schooling  or  her  environment  will  be  greatly  detrimental  to
         health".

         (ii) KDU's school has provided a letter dated 25 March 2019  signed
         by the headteacher confirming that she is a  Year  9  student,  and
         "attends weekly  counselling  sessions  with  Harrow  Horizons,  an
         emotional well-being service". The sessions are described  as  "on-
         going to support [KDU] with her mental health and  well-being".  It
         is  stated:  "This  service  is  extremely  essential  to   [KDU]'s
         emotional development".  (Print-outs  of  two  text  messages  from
         Harrow Horizons in respect of appointment details  have  also  been
         provided as evidence of such counselling sessions.)

         (iii) For the avoidance of any doubt I do not consider  that  there
         is anything of substance to which I should accord weight in respect
         of this issue in the letter dated 15 March 2019 from the University
         of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital. The letter is not based on  any
         actual  face-to-face  assessment   of   the   Appellant.   Further,
         notwithstanding that I note that the letter is seemingly signed  by
         a different consultant haematologist, no attempt has been  made  to
         address the concerns raised in the error of law decision in respect
         of the earlier letter from the Hospital (error of law  decision  at
         paragraphs 13 and 14), and the current writer,  another  consultant
         haematologist, similarly does not indicate any  relevant  expertise
         in neurodevelopmental neurological matters.


12.  Drawing these matters together, in my judgement the  following  picture
    emerges of KDU's health and cognitive ability:

         (i) In respect of sickle-cell disease,  despite  the  complications
         arising after a bone marrow transplant  because  of  'graft  versus
         host' disease, this is currently  managed  in  consequence  of  the
         remedial  effect  of  the  transplant  together  with  the  ongoing
         prescription of penicillin as a prophylactic antibiotic to  prevent
         infection.

         (ii) In consequence of a cerebrovascular accident in 2013  she  was
         left physically weakened and received physiotherapy to combat  such
         symptoms. There is some residual  weakness,  but  not  such  as  to
         inhibit her attendance at a mainstream school,  and  engagement  in
         social activities through her church.

         (iii) The cerebrovascular accident has also resulted in a degree of
         cognitive  impairment,  but  for  the  main  part  the   assessment
         conducted in June 2016 showed function to be within  normal  ranges
         save in respect of processing speed which was extremely slow.

         (iv) KDU also presently suffers from mixed anxiety  and  depression
         of moderate intensity, in respect of which she has input by way  of
         weekly counselling sessions provided  by  an  emotional  well-being
         service.


13.  Further to the above, I note that there  was  some  discussion  at  the
    hearing in relation to the NHS card identifying KDU as being at risk of
    transfusion associated GVHD. This card states "If  I  need  to  have  a
    blood transfusion, cellular components (Red Cells and  Platelets)  MUST
    BE GAMMA IRRADIATED". The reason for this is given on the back  of  the
    card as "bone marrow transplant". The date of the issue of the card  is
    not easily discernible but  appears  to  be  in  2014.  The  card  also
    contains  the   following   information:   "Irradiated   blood   needed
    indefinitely or until _/_/_". Because the 'until'  date  had  not  been
    completed, I was invited to infer that irradiated blood would be needed
    indefinitely. I am content to do so.


14.  Mr Slatter acknowledged that whilst the Appellants  sought  to  suggest
    that gamma irradiated blood would not be available  in  Nigeria,  there
    was no supporting evidence to that effect.


15.  In her oral evidence DSU said that this card  had  been  given  to  the
    Appellant  when  she  left  hospital  after  her  initial  bone  marrow
    transplant. Necessarily, this  pre-dated  DSU's  and  KDU's  return  to
    Nigeria in May 2015. When asked  why  the  supposed  unavailability  of
    gamma irradiated blood in Nigeria had not inhibited return in May 2015,
    DSU stated "we did not really think about it". She was then asked  when
    she had found out that such blood was not available:  she  stated  that
    they had made enquiries but did not  get  an  answer;  they  had  asked
    medical personnel and had been told that there was a  blood  bank  "but
    did not really get an answer".


16.  I note that the Appellants have produced  two  letters  from  different
    consultant haematologists at the University of Court Harcourt  Teaching
    Hospital. The more recent letter, dated 15 March 2019,  which  -  as  I
    have observed above - does not address the concerns in respect  of  the
    earlier letter, refers to such things as the absence of infrastructure,
    the poor quality of  neurological  support,  and  risks  of  infection.
    However, nothing specific is said about gamma irradiated blood. This is
    notwithstanding that the history of  GVHD  was  clearly  known  to  the
    writer. It seems to me almost inconceivable that if it  were  genuinely
    the case that such blood was not available in Nigeria,  the  consultant
    haematologist writing the letter  of  15  March  2019  would  not  have
    expressly stated so as a core element of his letter.


17.  I note that there is a reference  to  gamma  irradiated  blood  in  the
    earlier letter of 4 May 2017: "There is also high risk of infection and
    malaria burden in Nigeria and with  [KDU]'s  medical  history,  current
    facilities may be inadequate to cope with  any  new  health  challenges
    that  may  arise  such  as  giving  her  gamma  irradiated  blood;  the
    facilities are unfortunately not available currently." In my  judgement
    there is a lack of clarity  in  this  passage,  switching  as  it  does
    between  the  notion  of  facilities  possibly  being  inadequate,   to
    facilities not being available. I have  previously  observed  that  the
    writer did not accurately set out or reproduce the opinions of  the  UK
    healthcare professionals (paragraph 14 of the error of  law  decision);
    in my judgement this necessarily undermines the general reliability  of
    this particular document. Moreover, it predates the  subsequent  letter
    by approximately 2 years, and  so  in  any  event  cannot  be  seen  as
    reliable evidence of the current circumstances in Nigeria.


18.  I am  sceptical  that  DSU  did  not  ascertain  that  such  blood  was
    available before returning to  Nigeria  with  her  daughter  after  the
    transplant. In any event the enquiries that she claims to have made and
    claims to have been inconclusive are hardly evidence of unavailability.


19.  In all such circumstances,  and  also  bearing  in  mind  Mr  Slatter's
    acknowledgement that there is no supporting evidence on point,  I  find
    that I am not satisfied that  the  Appellants  have  shown  that  gamma
    irradiated blood is not available in Nigeria.


20.  In this context I also note that transfusion - regular or  otherwise  -
    is no part of KDU's ongoing treatment. The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    noted that it was confirmed in evidence that no transfusions  had  been
    required  since  the  transplant  (paragraph  59).  The  need   for   a
    transfusion accordingly is only to be envisaged in the  event  of  some
    sort of medical emergency such as a serious traffic accident. It  seems
    to  me  that  this  is  essentially  too  remote  to  sound  with   any
    significance in the overall context of these appeals.


21.  The best interests of a  child  or  children  have  to  be  taken  into
    account as a primary - although not paramount -  consideration  in  the
    context of immigration decisions and appeals.


22.   I  am  persuaded  that  it  is  in  KDU's  best  interests  that   her
    circumstances remain much as they are at present. I take  into  account
    the very difficult circumstances of  the  medical  problems  that  have
    impacted on her early life, and have seen her travel  from  Nigeria  to
    the UK, return to Nigeria, and then have to return to the UK again  for
    further treatment following the episode of GVHD. Although  her  sickle-
    cell disease seems largely now  under  control,  there  are  continuing
    consequences of the cardiovascular accident. More  particularly  -  and
    most  likely  in  consequence  of  her  experience  of   illness   with
    significant medical interventions - KDU is diagnosed with  symptoms  of
    depression and anxiety in respect of which she is receiving counselling
    at school. I acknowledge Dr de Silva's opinion as to the benefits of  a
    period of stability, and the potential detriment of further upheaval.


23.  In reaching this decision I take into account that  KDU's  presence  in
    the UK has been at the cost of being apart from her father  (albeit  he
    has made annual visits to the UK). To that extent,  I  acknowledge  the
    force of the argument that it would be in her best interests to  return
    to Nigeria to resume family life in the company of both parents, rather
    than just her mother. In this context I accept that  the  support  that
    her mother has given her would continue and act to insulate her against
    the potential upheaval of relocating back to Nigeria again,  where  she
    would also then  have  the  support  of  both  parents  to  manage  any
    psychological or other detrimental consequences of relocation. To  this
    extent the question of whether KDUs best interests  are  protected  and
    promoted by remaining in the UK or  returning  to  Nigeria,  is  finely
    balanced: it seems to me that it is only marginally the case  that  the
    stability referred to by Dr de Silva outweighs the benefit of  residing
    with both parents. In this context I note that  Dr  de  Silva  has  not
    addressed the circumstance of the absence  of  KDU's  father  from  her
    life, and has not  expressly  addressed  the  extent  to  which  loving
    parents might effectively manage relocation to minimise the  impact  on
    KDU.


24.  In this context I also find that there  is  nothing  in  the  materials
    before me to establish on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant
    would  not  have  access  in  Nigeria  to  any   necessary   continuing
    treatments, whether they be in respect of physical or mental  problems.
    In the event of any extreme complications - which as matters stand  are
    not shown to be more  likely  than  not  -  there  will  again  be  the
    potential option of travelling outside Nigeria  for  medical  treatment
    should any required treatment not be available in Nigeria. Nor is there
    any supporting evidence to suggest that KDU's circumstances  and  needs
    could not be accommodated within the education system in Nigeria.


25.  In this context and generally I note that there does not appear  to  be
    any significant financial difficulties facing the family. For  example,
    in the application form signed by the First  Appellant  on  5  February
    2016 it was stated in respect of financial resources that  her  husband
    provided her in the UK with �400 weekly, together  with  �1600  monthly
    for rent and �400 monthly for bills. It was  also  stated  "my  husband
    provides what we need" (question 5.13). Nothing further has been stated
    of significance in respect of the family's financial circumstances that
    might  suggest  anything  other  than  that  the  Appellants  will   be
    adequately  maintained  and  accommodated  in  Nigeria,  or  that   the
    considerable extra expenditure in supporting the family whilst it is in
    the UK could not be redirected, for example,  to  support  KDU  in  her
    education in Nigeria.


26.  Although the primary focus  of  these  appeals  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and before the Upper Tribunal has been upon the  circumstances
    of KDU, I have not lost sight of the fact  that  there  are  two  other
    minor Appellants. OAU (just a few days short of his  10th  birthday  at
    the date of hearing) and OOU (aged 12 years 4 months  at  the  date  of
    hearing), last entered the UK in November 2015, coming  to  join  their
    mother and  sister  who  had  returned  to  the  UK  in  July  2015  in
    consequence of the episode of GVHD. Nothing specific  is  presented  or
    argued in respect of any  particular  educational,  medical,  or  other
    needs of OAU and OOU. In such circumstances it seems to me  that  their
    best interests would be protected and promoted if they were  to  return
    to their country of nationality with their mother and sister, to  enjoy
    family life in the company of their father. The primary reason for them
    being in the UK is the necessity of their mother having  come  here  to
    accompany their sister whilst she underwent her various treatments.  Of
    course, in the event that their sister and mother were to remain in the
    UK, it  is  likely  that  their  best  interests  would  be  served  by
    continuing to live in the UK with them.


27.  I take forward the 'best interests' considerations set out  above  into
    my consideration of the grounds of appeal based on  Article  8  of  the
    ECHR, bearing in mind  also  that  the  factual  matrix  for  the  best
    interests considerations is similar to the facts and circumstances that
    inform the Article 8 evaluation.


28.  In her witness statement DSU states that KDU "has lived in the  UK  for
    5 years and 6 months". This dates back to the first entry in  September
    2013. I accept Mr Lindsay's submissions in this regard that this is  to
    overstate the length of residence in the UK.


29.  In my judgement it is plain from the evidence  and  circumstances  that
    when the First Appellant came to the UK with her ill daughter  in  2013
    it was with the genuine intention of remaining temporarily for  medical
    treatment. I find that it was in the minds of the First  Appellant  and
    KDU that they were in substance visitors to the UK, and that their home
    remained in Nigeria, where the  First  Appellant's  husband  and  other
    children continued to  reside.  Indeed,  although  the  other  children
    visited the UK during this period, it was the case  that  DSU  and  KDU
    returned to Nigeria in May 2015 at a time when it was  considered  that
    the medical treatment had reached  a  conclusion,  and  an  appropriate
    period of recovery had elapsed. In my judgement it was the intention in
    May 2015 that  the  family  would  thereafter  continue  to  reside  in
    Nigeria. It was only because of the  unfortunate  circumstance  of  the
    GVHD episode that a return to the UK for further treatment was made.  I
    also find that at the time of the return to the UK in November 2015  it
    was not envisaged that any of the family members should relocate to the
    UK on a permanent basis, but  rather  that  again  entry  was  for  the
    temporary purpose of seeking to resolve the medical issues of KDU.


30.  Whilst it is inherent in the application made  in  February  2016  that
    the intention - at least of the responsible parent  in  the  UK  -  had
    become to seek a less limited residence in the UK, it is apparent  that
    the primary motivating force  was  to  achieve  some  'peace  of  mind'
    "knowing there are adequate facilities and medical  personnel  to  look
    after [KDU]" (Respondent's bundle before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
    A40). The application was not made  on  the  basis  of  any  particular
    length of residence in the  UK,  or  otherwise  on  the  basis  of  the
    establishment of any sort of private life by any of the Appellants, who
    had - as I find - up until that time envisaged their family and private
    lives resuming and continuing in due course in Nigeria.


31.  In such circumstances it seems to me that not only does the  nature  of
    any private life established in the UK  fall  to  be  characterised  as
    having  been  established  at  a  time  when  immigration  status   was
    'precarious' in a technical sense pursuant to section  117B(6)  of  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, but also  in  a  practical
    sense - at least up until the date of the  application  -  it  was  not
    perceived by the Appellants themselves that they had established a home
    in the UK. And even then, the basis upon which  they  sought  leave  to
    remain was not because of the quality of any private life that had been
    established by any or all of them, but because of the medical  concerns
    attaching to the circumstances of KDU.


32.  Necessarily I acknowledge that there has been a passage of  time  since
    the making of the application in February 2016 in  which  each  of  the
    Appellants will have developed something further in respect of  private
    lives. However, beyond the supporting evidence  from  the  church,  the
    focus of the evidence in respect of private life relates to the medical
    circumstances and education of KDU. Little else meaningful is  advanced
    in respect of the private life of any of the other Appellants.


33.  There is no aspect of the Immigration Rules that can avail KDU  or  any
    of the other minor Appellants. Nor is there any basis for reaching  any
    different conclusion from that of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in
    respect  of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  as  it  pertains  to  the  First
    Appellant.


34.  As regards a freestanding evaluation of Article 8, I  indicated  to  Mr
    Slatter during the course  of  submissions  that  I  did  not  see  any
    difficulties for the Appellants - and KDU in particular - in respect of
    the first four of the five Razgar  questions.  I  have  also  indicated
    above that I consider - albeit marginally - that it is  in  KDU's  best
    interests presently to remain in the UK.


35.  In considering the fifth Razgar question -  proportionality  -  I  take
    into account in respect of  KDU  the  matters  that  have  informed  my
    evaluation of best interests. What is particularly  pertinent  in  this
    regard is that she is working towards achieving a period  of  stability
    after the most extraordinarily difficult early years of her  life,  and
    is doing so with a degree of support by way of a counselling service. I
    acknowledge that there will be a disruption in the event of her removal
    from the UK. However, as I have also pointed out above, this  would  be
    ameliorated to some extent by the continuing support and guidance  that
    would be offered to her by her mother, and also by the fact  that  upon
    removal  to  Nigeria  the  family  unit  would  be  reunited  with  the
    children's father and the partner  of  the  First  Appellant.  To  this
    extent, whilst I am satisfied that the relatively  low  hurdle  of  the
    first two Razgar questions is comfortably cleared by KDU,  the  gravity
    of the interference with her private life is compensated  by  the  fact
    that any temporary upheaval can be managed, and that  her  family  life
    will be strengthened. Further, for the reasons given above,  I  do  not
    find that the Appellants have demonstrated any  cause  for  concern  in
    respect of KDU's medical and educational needs being adequately met  in
    the event of her return to Nigeria.


36.  The extent of the interference with  KDU's  private  life  as  explored
    above, needs to  be  balanced  against  the  public  interest  concerns
    pursuant to sections 117A and 117B of  the  2002  Act.  In  respect  of
    section 117B(1) I note that the maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    control is ordinarily achieved through the consistent application of  a
    published set of Immigration Rules,  and  further  that  KDU  does  not
    satisfy any of the Rules. There does not appear  to  be  any  issue  in
    respect of English language (117B(2)), and although, as  a  child,  not
    financially independent it appears that  KDU  is  adequately  supported
    through her father's financial contributions (117B(3)). The  Appellants
    have been present in the UK with leave - including statutorily extended
    leave because of the appeal proceedings - at all relevant times:  there
    is no  hint  of  unlawful  residence  (117B(4));  but  as  noted  above
    immigration status has been precarious at all material times (117B(5)).


37.  On balance I find the Respondent's decision in so  far  as  it  impacts
    upon KDU's private life to be proportionate. KDU has had the benefit of
    the medical treatments that prompted her return to the UK  in  November
    2015; she has made a good recovery in respect of her physical  illness,
    and her ongoing treatment regime of  prophylactic  antibiotics  can  be
    continued in Nigeria. While she has entered the education system in the
    UK, she will be able to be educated upon her return to Nigeria, and  in
    so far as there is any disruption this will  essentially  be  temporary
    and not significantly different  from  the  disruption  experienced  by
    other migrant children. In this context,  and  on  the  facts  of  this
    particular case, I acknowledge the importance  of  stability,  and  the
    diagnosis of depression and anxiety  -  but  see  no  reason  why  such
    matters  -  including  the  potential  psychological  impact   of   the
    disruption of relocation - cannot be adequately managed in Nigeria with
    the  love  and  care  of  both  of  her  parents.  I  can  see  nothing
    sufficiently compelling to justify relaxing  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules to permit KDU to remain in the  UK  in  circumstances
    where she does not qualify under the Rules.


38.  As noted above, nothing further specific or particular is  advanced  in
    respect  of  the  First  Appellant  or  the  other  minor   Appellants.
    Essentially their cases are based upon KDU's case and  stand  and  fall
    with it. On my findings their cases fall.

                                    ANNEX

    TEXT OF ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS FOLLOWING HEARING ON 28
                                NOVEMBER 2018


1.   These are linked appeals against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Malcolm promulgated on 26 July 2018 in which  she  dismissed  the
    appeals of the Appellants on human rights grounds against a decision of
    the Respondent dated 18 August 2017 to refuse leave to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.


2.   I am  persuaded  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    vitiated for error of law.


3.   In the particular circumstances I do not propose to  set  out  here  in
    full the details  of  the  case.   The  immigration  histories  of  the
    Appellants and the medical history of  one  of  the  Appellants  are  a
    matter of record, are known to the parties and  are  -  in  almost  all
    regards - not the subject of any particular  dispute.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge has set out  all  pertinent  matters  in  her  decision.
    Indeed, notwithstanding my ultimate conclusion, the decision  of  Judge
    Malcolm is one of detail and clarity, and - it seems to me  -  save  in
    one respect, is unimpugnable.


4.   For present purposes it is adequate to set out  the  following  matters
    by way of background.


5.   The focus in these proceedings has been on the Appellant KDU  (date  of
    birth 21 September 2004).  At the age  of  1  she  was  diagnosed  with
    sickle cell disease.  In August 2013  she  suffered  a  cerebrovascular
    accident (or stroke).  On 29 September 2013  she  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom with the First Appellant, her mother, for  treatment.   In  due
    course that treatment involved a  bone  marrow  transplant  which  took
    place in October 2014 with  the  First  Appellant  as  donor.   It  was
    considered that  this  would  be  an  effective  way  of  treating  the
    underlying sickle cell disease.  In due course,  the  operation  having
    taken place and the appropriate recovery period having  been  observed,
    the First Appellant and KDU returned to Nigeria in May 2015.


6.   During this period  of  treatment  the  other  children  of  the  First
    Appellant had remained in Nigeria: the First Appellant has  been  clear
    in her evidence - and it has not been disputed - that it was never  the
    intention that she and/or KDU should  try  and  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom; it had been the plan to  return  to  Nigeria  to  resume  life
    there.  Further in this regard Mr Richardson has emphasised  that  this
    was not a family that had come  to  the  United  Kingdom  as  so-called
    'health tourists'.  The treatment that  KDU  received  was  at  private
    expense, amounting to approximately �173,000 for the  transplant  (e.g.
    see paragraph 51 of the Decision of the First-tier Tribunal).


7.   However,  shortly  after  return  to  Nigeria  KDU  developed  worrying
    symptoms.  In due course these were diagnosed as  'graft  versus  host'
    disease ('GVHD'), that is to say that the body (the host) was resistant
    to accepting the new tissue (the graft) that had been  transplanted  to
    the patient.  In consequence and upon advice of doctors in  Nigeria  as
    to their ability to deal with the issue, the First  Appellant  and  KDU
    returned to the United Kingdom in July 2015.  KDU thereafter  underwent
    further treatment to manage  the  GVHD,  which  appears  to  have  been
    successful.  Indeed by the date of the proceedings  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal the following  matters  -  as  set  out  in  the  Judge's
    findings at paragraph 115-119 - seemingly pertained:

         "115.    Whilst there is  extensive  documentary  evidence  in  the
                papers of  the  second  appellant's  medical  condition  and
                treatment, the most up-to-date consultant information is the
                report from the consultant  paediatric  haematologist  dated
                19th April 2017 (pages 57 to 59 of the appellant's  bundle).
                The consultant has noted that it is likely that  [KDU]  will
                return to Nigeria and recommends that he see  her  again  on
                12th April 2018.


         116. In March 2018, a letter was sent indicating that [KDU] was  no
                longer  eligible  for  NHS  care  and  further   follow   up
                appointments were cancelled.


         117. Since then, the first appellant has simply taken [KDU] to  see
                her GP where she has regular check ups.


         118. In addition to being prescribed Penicillin the only  treatment
                which [KDU] is receiving at the moment are  check  ups  with
                her GP where her bloods are tested and she has three monthly
                physiotherapy appointments.  The first  appellant  has  been
                given a note of the exercises which [KDU] has to  undertake.




         119. From this information, I consider it reasonable to assess that
                there is no immediate concern about [KDU]'s health."




8.   Further to the reference to ineligibility for  NHS  care  at  paragraph
    116, I understand that notwithstanding that the initial transplant  and
    treatment were funded privately, after her return to  the  UK  in  July
    2015 KDU received free treatment  on  the  NHS.   As  noted  there  was
    subsequently a communication from the NHS to the effect that she was no
    longer eligible for such treatment  -  and  thereafter  it  seems  that
    certain follow-up appointments were not kept.


9.   Be that as it may the Judge's evaluation of the  evidence  -  which  it
    seems to me up to this point is entirely sustainable  -  suggests  that
    the underlying sickle cell disease was being managed in consequence  of
    the remedial effect of the transplant, together with  the  prescription
    of penicillin.  KDU's active, as it were, ongoing  treatment  otherwise
    related to physiotherapy which was to combat the  consequences  of  the
    cerebrovascular accident that had occurred in  2013.   The  stroke  had
    left KDU weak of limb and accordingly physiotherapy was  undertaken  to
    try and build up strength in this regard.


10.  Another consequence of the cerebrovascular accident was, seemingly,  an
    element of cognitive impairment.  There  is  on  file  a  psychological
    assessment report dated 9 June 2016 prepared by a clinical psychologist
    at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust  assessing  the  Appellant
    under the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for  Children.   The  results  of
    that evaluation are somewhat mixed: KDU's verbal comprehension was well
    within the average range; working  memory  was  shown  to  be  average;
    perceptual reasoning was lower than average, but still within a  normal
    range; however, KDU's processing speed was extremely low to the  extent
    that she was on the second percentile.   The  psychological  assessment
    report made various recommendations as to things that  the  Appellant's
    school might consider by way of  supporting  her  with  her  processing
    speed.


11.  There is a further reference in  the  materials  on  file  to  concerns
    about neurodevelopment.  The consultant haematologist treating the  KDU
    wrote a report dated 18 January 2017 reviewing her  circumstances.   In
    the context of that report reference was made to a pre-transplant  MRI,
    the details of which are summarised in the report.  Upon  consideration
    of the MRI report the consultant haematologist commented:

         "Hence I recommend that  her  GP  refers  her  to  a  neurology  or
         neurodevelopmental service to assess her limitation and support her
         needs."


12.  There is also on file a copy of a referral letter dated 15  March  2017
    written on the letterhead of the KDU's  GP  to  the  Neurodevelopmental
    Clinic, Department of Paediatrics, Northwick Park Hospital (page 93  of
    the Appellants' bundle before  the  First-tier  Tribunal),  making  the
    referral recommended by the consultant haematologist.  Reference to the
    referral is to be found in the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  at
    paragraph 94, amongst the details of the submissions advanced on behalf
    of the Appellants.  It is said that an appointment  had  been  arranged
    with the neurodevelopmental service which had been  cancelled  late  in
    2017.   Reference  is  also  made  in  the  same   paragraph   to   the
    psychological assessment. It was then suggested - with reference to the
    contents of pages 167 and 168 of the  Appellants'  First-tier  Tribunal
    bundle - that the reports had been copied to  a  consultant  paediatric
    neurologist, in consequence of which the Appellants' counsel "submitted
    that the neurologist must have been involved at some stage".   However,
    the documents at pages 167 and 168, whilst  'copying-in'  a  consultant
    paediatric neurologist, are documents that date  from  September  2014.
    These do not therefore demonstrate that the consultant neurologist  was
    actively involved in the Appellant's case at the time of  the  referral
    made in March 2017.


13.  Further, there was a letter  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  from  a
    consultant haematologist based in Nigeria.  The letter was dated 4  May
    2017 and was from the consultant haematologist and head  of  department
    at  the  Department  of  Haematology  and  blood  transfusion  at   the
    University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital.  It appears - and indeed
    it was  acknowledged  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  by  the  First
    Appellant - that the consultant in Nigeria was drawing upon the medical
    evidence provided to him by the First  Appellant  from  the  healthcare
    professionals in the United Kingdom: see paragraph 54.  Indeed  it  may
    be seen by comparing the letter  of  4  May  2017  with  the  UK  based
    consultant haematologist's letter of January 2017 that the  details  of
    KDU's MRI scan are taken from that letter.  Having  referred  to  those
    details the consultant in Nigeria states this:

         "... She needs highly specialised regular  neurological  assessment
         with neurodevelopmental service which are lacking in Nigeria."


14.  It seems to me that this latter quoted  passage  takes  matters  beyond
    the opinions expressed in the source documents - that  is  to  say  the
    documents  from  the  UK  healthcare  professionals.   The   consultant
    haematologist in the United Kingdom  does  not  opine  that  KDU  needs
    regular assessment so much as recommending that she be referred for  an
    assessment.  What happens thereafter  will  necessarily  be  contingent
    upon that  assessment.   To  that  extent  it  seems  to  me  that  the
    consultant in Nigeria has not accurately  set  out  or  reproduced  the
    opinions of the UK healthcare  professionals,  and  has  not  otherwise
    identified the basis of his own opinion or his particular expertise  in
    neurodevelopment or neurological matters bearing  in  mind  his  stated
    position as a haematologist.


15.  It is, it seems to me, to  this  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    refers at paragraph 124:


         "It was suggested that should [KDU] become ill, that  the  required
         treatment would not be available to her in Nigeria.  In support  of
         this, reliance was placed on the report from the University of Port
         Harcourt Teaching Hospital dated 4th May  2017  where  it's  stated
         that  [KDU]   needs   highly   specialised   regular   neurological
         assessments with neurodevelopment services  which  are  lacking  in
         Nigeria.  It is to be assumed  that  there  had  been  neurological
         involvement at some point (given that reports were  copied  to  the
         neurologist) there was, however, no report from a  neurologist  nor
         was there any indication that [KDU] required  ongoing  neurological
         assessment or assessment with neurodevelopment services."




16.  From the foregoing it seems adequately clear that  if  there  had  been
    any neurological involvement it could only be dated in 2014, and  there
    had not seemingly been any neurological involvement subsequent  to  the
    referral made in early 2017.


17.  However, the fact and terms  of  the  referral  in  2017  does,  in  my
    judgement, render factually inaccurate the  Judge's  statement  to  the
    effect that there  was  no  indication  that  an  ongoing  neurological
    assessment was required.   There  was  evidence  of  significantly  low
    (second  percentile)  processing   speed,   and   in   consequence   of
    consideration of an MRI report a consultant's recommendation  that  KDU
    be referred "to a neurology or neurodevelopmental service to assess her
    limitation and support her needs"; there had then been a referral  made
    by KDU's G.P.; but  a  subsequent  appointment  had  been  cancelled  -
    seemingly consequent  upon  a  recognition  of  ineligibility  for  NHS
    treatment. There was  no  intervening  evidence  to  suggest  that  the
    recommended referral was no longer appropriate.


18.  The  factual  misconception  in  this  regard  was,  in  my  judgement,
    material to the consideration of 'best interests'.


19.  The Judge says this in respect of best interests at paragraph 142:


         "I am fully aware of the requirement to consider the best interests
         of the children (and in particular [KDU]) but I  am  not  satisfied
         that the  medical  evidence  is  such  that  KDU's  condition  adds
         significant weight to the degree that tip the balance in favour  of
         the appellants when considering whether the decision which has been
         made is proportionate."


    It seems  to  me  that  this  evaluation  was  premised  on  a  factual
    misconception as to the nature of the medical evidence - in  particular
    with regard to neurological deficit and the referral for a neurological
    assessment.  To that extent I am  persuaded  that  notwithstanding  the
    otherwise extremely thorough and careful analysis of this case  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge that there was a material error of law.


20.  In consequence, the decision in the appeal requires to be remade.


21.  Bearing in mind the very thorough treatment  of  the  evidence  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal and the absence of any significant dispute on fact,
    this is not a case that requires to be remitted  for  a  fresh  hearing
    with all issues at large.   The  appeal  is  accordingly  appropriately
    retained in the Upper Tribunal.


21.  There was a degree of discussion before me as to  the  possible  issues
    that might arise by reason of the outstanding neurological  assessment.
    Mr Richardson was not in  a  position  to  assist  as  to  how  it  was
    envisaged that such a neurological  assessment  would  be  secured  and
    completed in circumstances where it appeared that  KDU  was  no  longer
    entitled to NHS treatment without payment.   The  materials  that  have
    been filed in preparation for possible remaking of the decision include
    a confirmation of a referral by way of a letter from the Appellant's GP
    dated 16 November 2018 stating "this  is  to  confirm  that  the  above
    patient has been referred for a neurodevelopment doctor and is awaiting
    an appointment".  Mr Richardson was not in a position to  indicate  the
    extent to which it might be possible for the Appellants  to  deal  with
    any complication in respect of NHS funding by commissioning  a  private
    assessment.  Ms Everett for the Secretary of State raised the  question
    as to whether or not there would be any impact  on  Article  8  private
    life if it was necessary  for  that  assessment  to  take  place  at  a
    location other than the United Kingdom.   Mr  Richardson's  preliminary
    response to this observation was that the purpose of the assessment was
    to assist in evaluating the issue of best interests, and  it  was  only
    once that matter had been properly and duly evaluated that the question
    of removal could be properly considered.


22.  In the circumstances I did  not  consider  it  appropriate  to  proceed
    immediately to remaking the  decision  in  the  appeal,  but  that  the
    remaking of the decision should be done on a  different  occasion  with
    the benefit of any further available evidence and submissions from each
    side in accordance with the following Directions.


                                 DIRECTIONS

         (i) The Appellants should file and serve  within  21  days  of  the
         promulgation date shown at the top of  this  document  any  further
         evidence, including any further expert  evidence  upon  which  they
         wish to rely, including any neurological and/or  neurodevelopmental
         assessment in respect of KDU, and any consequently updated evidence
         as to the availability of support to meet KDU's needs in Nigeria.

         (ii) In the event that  a  neurological  and/or  neurodevelopmental
         assessment has not taken place the Appellants are to file and serve
         within the same timescale evidence indicating why this is  so,  and
         should also address by way of evidence the extent to which such  an
         assessment is or is not achievable outside the United Kingdom.

         (iii)  If  no  such  assessment  has  been  undertaken,  both   the
         Appellants  and  the  Respondent  should  be   prepared   to   make
         submissions at the next hearing as to the nature and extent of  any
         interference with the Article 8 protected rights of the  Appellants
         - and in particular KDU - if for any reason a  neurological  and/or
         neurodevelopmental assessment does not take  place  in  the  United
         Kingdom, bearing in mind that removal (or departure)  from  the  UK
         would not (subject of course to any evidence filed further to  (ii)
         above) obviously inevitably prevent such an assessment taking place
         elsewhere.


23.   Nothing  in  the  Directions  should  be  interpreted  as  seeking  to
    proscribe or limit the scope of evidence  to  be  filed  or  submission
    relied upon by the parties. The Directions have been  prepared  with  a
    view to covering the areas of particular discussion at  the  'error  of
    law' hearing, and it is acknowledged that other matters may be pursued.
    The parties are reminded that fair procedure requires  due  and  proper
    notice of evidence and any substantially new submissions  be  given  to
    the opposing party.
