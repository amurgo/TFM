Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr K Katani, of Katani & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent's reasons for refusing the appellant's claim  on  asylum
    and human rights grounds are stated in her  letter  dated  6  September
    2017.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge McGrade dismissed the appellant's appeal  for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 29 November 2017.

 3. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal.   Her  first  ground  was
    failure to have regard to country guidance on  risk  to  Christians  in
    China.  Her second ground was this:

         "The determination of the FtT makes no mention of  the  appellant's
         child whatsoever.  The reasons for  refusal  letter  considers  the
         child's best interests, and the appellant's appeal statement  makes
         clear that the appellant's daughter is dependent  on  her  mother's
         asylum claim.  The FtT ... erred by failing to  consider  the  best
         interests of the child,  which  requires  a  primary  and  separate
         consideration: ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4."

 4. On 10 January 2018 FtT Judge Parkes  granted  permission,  "limited  to
    consideration of the appellant's child as a dependant on her claim".

 5. In a rule 24 response to the grant of permission the respondent says:

         "...

         2.       It is not clear from the grounds on which basis the  issue
         of hukou for the child was pleaded, whether under articles 2, 3 and
         / or 8 or as a separate asylum ground ... there was  no  article  8
         claim pleaded (�28), on that basis it is submitted  there  were  no
         obstacles  to  the  appellant  and   her   family   returning   and
         reintegrating.

         3.       There is nothing in the determination to suggest that  any
         submissions were made by  the  appellant's  representative  on  the
         above issue beyond the very  short  reference  in  the  appellant's
         witness statement.  In any event, on the face of the grounds  there
         appears to be no reference to any evidence which  it  is  said  the
         judge failed to consider to establish the appellant's case."

 6. Mr Katani submitted thus.  Firstly, there had been an error.  It should
    have been obvious to the judge from many sources before  him  that  the
    case involved a child.  The appellant's statement gave at least a  hint
    of the problems which might be involved, namely difficulties over hukou
    registration.  Secondly, the error was material.  The  judge  correctly
    recorded at �28, "The appellant's solicitor indicated that he  was  not
    seeking to rely upon article 8", but the  best  interests  of  a  child
    always had to be separately considered, even if an appellant did not so
    submit, on the authority of ZH. The situation of  the  child  might  in
    principle have fallen within either article 3 or article  8,  or  both.
    The appellant suffers from hepatitis B, owes money in China, and  might
    have problems over hukou.  As the decision failed even to  mention  the
    existence of the child, it had to be set aside.

 7. I asked Mr Katani what should follow any  setting  aside.   He  had  no
    clear submission on that matter, but said eventually that there  should
    be a further hearing, either in the FtT or in  the  UT,  at  which  the
    appellant might seek the admission of further (unspecified) evidence.

 8. Mr Matthews submitted thus.  It appeared to be accepted that there  had
    been no submission to the FtT based on section 55 of the 2009  Act  and
    the best interests of the child.  The section  55  duty  was  generally
    pleaded in another context, usually article 8, although sometimes  also
    article 3.  ZH did not require the FtT to consider matters  which  were
    never put in issue.  The grounds of appeal to the FtT did  not  mention
    the best interests of the child.  There  had  been  no  application  to
    amend those grounds.  Even the ground of appeal to the UT did not state
    any relevance the matter had to the substantive outcome.  The judge was
    not to be criticised over an issue which he had not been asked to  deal
    with. His decision should not be interfered with.

 9. If the decision were to be set aside, Mr Matthews submitted thus.   The
    UT's directions indicated a presumption that re-making of the  decision
    would follow at the same hearing, based on the evidence before the  FtT
    and any further evidence admitted.  There had been no application  from
    the appellant to have further evidence  admitted,  although  directions
    made it clear that prompt application was required.  The appellant  was
    married, with a child, not in  breach  of  family  planning  policy  or
    liable to any penalty.  Her reference to potential problems over  hukou
    was vacuous. There was nothing in relation to the child  by  which  she
    might succeed, which was no doubt why the matter was  not  put  to  the
    FtT.  Finally, the respondent would seek to refer to  the  decision  of
    the FtT  in  case  PA/03809/20145,  promulgated  on  12  October  2016,
    dismissing an appeal by the appellant's husband.

10. Mr Katani submitted in reply as follows.  The judge was obliged to deal
    with the child's best interests even in absence of a submission, if the
    matter arose from the evidence.  The mother said in her  statement  she
    was  worried  about  hukou.   The  case   had   required   "much   more
    comprehensive consideration".

11. I reserved my decision.

12. The grant of permission may have been  made  in  an  over-abundance  of
    caution.  The ground of appeal  to  the  UT  at  least  verges  on  the
    disingenuous. It looks for error in a way which  is  only  formalistic,
    and which flies in the face of the way representatives had advanced the
    case to the FtT.

13. The appellant has referred to no passage of  authority  which  required
    the judge to say any more than he did in resolving the case before him.

14. There is lacking from the grounds and submissions even the  outline  of
    any specific case based on the best interests of the child which  might
    have led to the appellant's appeal being allowed by the FtT,  or  which
    might lead to any further decision in her favour.

15. Any removal will be of the appellant along with her husband and  child.
    The appellant has referred to no evidence by which that  outcome  might
    rationally  have  been  found  to  impact  adversely  on  her   child's
    interests, so as to give her a right to  remain  in  the  UK.   If  the
    decision had been set aside, it could only have been remade to the same
    effect.

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

17. The FtT made an anonymity direction.   There does not  appear  to  have
    been an application for one, but as the matter was not referred  to  in
    the UT, anonymity has been preserved herein.
