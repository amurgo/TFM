                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Miss K Prendergast for the Secretary of State
Mr G Rodwell (solicitor, Southerns, Nelson) for the claimant

   This is an appeal from a decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Mr  D  Borsada),
   sitting at Walsall on 9 July, allowing an asylum and human rights  appeal
   by a citizen of Albania, who claimed to fear the effects of a blood-feud.
   Leave was given on the basis that the adjudicator had not given effect to
   the decision of the Court of Appeal in Skenderaj  [2002]  EWCA  567.  The
   Home Office say they put it before him, though there is no trace of it on
   the file, and they failed to field a presenting officer  to  explain  its
   importance. It was common ground before us that his asylum decision could
   not stand in the light of that; but the court (per Auld LJ) had things to
   say also relevant to the human rights aspect. (They did not consider  the
   main question of fact, whether the  Albanian  authorities  were  able  to
   provide effective protection for victims of blood-feuds, because that had
   been conceded in Skenderaj).

2. These were the relevant passages:


  43. There may be difficulty, where the sufficiency of protection has to be
      measured against the practical limitations on a state to  protect  its
      citizens from violence or threats of  violence  to  which  it  is  not
      alerted and its protection is deliberately not sought. To stigmatise a
      state so hampered as providing insufficient protection  would  wrongly
      impose on it a duty of guarantee, which, as Lords Hope and Clyde  said
      in Horvath, respectively at 500F-H and 510F-H, would be beyond what is
      required or, as the European Court held in Osman, at paragraph 116  in
      relation  to  Article  2  of  the  ECHR,  would  be  disproportionate.
      Effective policing depends heavily on policing by consent.  The  Court
      has recently determined that such an approach conforms with Strasbourg
      jurisprudence; see Dhima v. IAT (CO/2392/2001), 2002.  However,  given
      the  adjudicator's  finding  and  the  Tribunal's  acceptance  of  the
      Albanian authorities' inability to provide protection even if  sought,
      this difficulty does not arise in this case.

  44. On the  other  hand,  if  the  state  can  provide  a  sufficiency  of
      protection which an applicant is not disabled  from  seeking,  he  can
      only rely on the alternative of his unwillingness  to  do  so,  if  it
      flows  from  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution,  for  example  of
      collusion of the authorities  with  his  persecutors,  in  effect,  an
      insufficiency of protection rendering him unable to avail  himself  of
      it. It would not qualify under this alternative that he does not  seek
      protection because he has a well-founded belief that the  state  won't
      provide it or, as the adjudicator appears to have found, because of  a
      societal norm not to seek it. We do not regard Lord Lloyd's use of the
      words "for whatever reason" in the passage from Lord Lloyd's speech in
      Aden, on which Mr. Vokes relied, as applicable to inability to  afford
      protection  produced  by  unwillingness  of  an  applicant   to   seek
      protection for reasons other than  fear  of  persecution,  since  that
      would make the second alternative  of  unwillingness  "owing  to  such
      fear" otiose. If the reason is a well-founded belief  that  the  State
      would not provide protection, such a construction is,  in  any  event,
      unnecessary, since such a state of mind would amount  to  well-founded
      fear that would satisfy the first alternative of  inability  to  avail
      himself of protection. Lord Lloyd touched on this point in Horvath, at
      507D-E:

      "As for the second part of the protection test, there will not be many
      cases in which an applicant who  is  able  to  avail  himself  of  the
      protection of his country of origin, will succeed on the  ground  that
      he is unwilling to do so. Here the applicant's case ' . .. is that  he
      regards the local police as ineffective and indifferent. But he is not
      the sole judge of that. The test is objective. The Immigration  Appeal
      Tribunal has found as a fact that the available  protection  satisfies
      the Convention standard. There  are  no  special  circumstances  which
      would enable the applicant to succeed on  the  second  branch  of  the
      protection test, having failed on the first. .. ."


  45. In our view, it was inappropriate for the  Tribunal  when  considering
      the issue of state protection, on which  it  based  its  decision,  to
      argue that there was  no  discrimination  by  the  state  because  the
      absence of protection flowed from unwillingness of blood feud  victims
      to seek it rather than the state's failure to extend it to them.  Such
      reasoning begs the essential question under  Article  1A  (2)  whether
      unwillingness, as distinct from inability, is "owing  to"  a  fear  of
      persecution. As Mr. Vokes submitted, such  a  blanket  exclusion  from
      state protection is plainly discriminatory, amounting as it  would  to
      an autonomous persecutory  system  lying  "outside  society".  In  any
      event, despite the close inter-relationship of the fear and protection
      tests, it is, in our view,  unhelpful  and  unnecessary  in  non-state
      persecution cases to turn to discrimination or the  lack  of  it  when
      focusing on the latter.

  46. The critical factor in cases where a victim of  non-state  persecution
      is unwilling to seek state protection is not necessarily  whether  the
      state is able and willing to provide a sufficiency  of  protection  to
      the Horvath standard, though in many cases it may be  highly  relevant
      to the victim's well- founded fear of persecution. The test is whether
      the potential victim's unwillingness to seek it flows from that  fear.
      As we have said, the Tribunal clearly accepted, in paragraph 9 of  its
      decision, the adjudicator's finding that those involved Albanian blood
      feuds, including by implication Mr.  Skenderaj,  do  not  seek  police
      protection because they consider it would not be effective.



3. To sum up the effect of what the Court of Appeal said in Skenderaj,

   a) victims' reluctance to seek  state  protection  (though  it  will  not
      disentitle  them)  will  not  of  itself  entitle  them  to  surrogate
      international protection, unless for a Refugee Convention reason;
   b) effective protection depends on consent, and lack of  co-operation  by
      those at risk may be relevant to the question  of  whether  the  state
      will carry out its responsibilities to them;
   c) victims are not to be the judges of whether state protection would  be
      effective if sought, which  calls  for  an  objective  answer  by  the
      tribunal.

4. This is what the adjudicator had to say on the point:  Mr  TKH  Robertson
   is a London solicitor and vice-chairman of  the  British  Albanian  Legal
   Association, who wrote to the claimant's solicitors on 19 June 2002.

   22. Mr Rodwell has summarised the objective evidence in his  submissions.
      I would accept, in turn, that Mr Robertson is  an  expert  on  Albania
      having read  the  introduction  to  his  report.  I  also  accept  the
      reasoning within Mr Robertson's report  and  all  the  conclusions  he
      reached. By contrast the respondent has only dealt  with  the  general
      position in Albania and has not attempted to address the  evidence  in
      relation to blood feuds. I note that Mr Robertson  does  not  consider
      state protection as sufficient in the  appellant's  circumstances.  In
      that sense the Authorities have failed the test  set  out  in  Horvath
      (2000 Imm AR 205). I note that the Mr Robertson does not consider that
      anywhere is safe in Albania and the appellant's experiences in  Tirana
      would seem to bear this view out. ...

   5. We do not know which if any version of the CIPU report the adjudicator
      had before him; again  that  was  the  Home  Office's  fault  for  not
      fielding a presenting officer; but we have the October 2002 one, which
      contains a very full treatment of the blood-feud problem at �� 6.123 -
      6.132, to which we shall return. (Ravichandran [1996] Imm AR 97  makes
      it clear we can and must accept that advantage over  the  adjudicator;
      even if the October report referred to events which had happened since
      his decision, as it does not.



   6. This is the relevant part of Mr Robertson's letter:

   3.       Mr Koci's fear of  assassination by  a  member  of  the  Shtefni
      family is certainly well grounded.

      Revenge killing has been a feature of the Albanian culture since  time
      immemorial and its deep roots are evidenced by its  immediate  revival
      after its successful suppression by the communists during the 47 years
      they were in power. It happens throughout Albania but is  particularly
      evident in the north where Mr. Koci is from and where  the  taking  of
      blood was one feature of the wider code  of  unwritten  customary  law
      which prevailed in the region until King Zog's time and which is still
      sometimes applied. The Shtefni family will remain dishonoured so  long
      as they have only taken one life for the two they lost to the  gun  of
      Mr. Koci' s father. Women are entirely excluded from the code of blood
      vengeance and as Mr. Dashamir Koci appears to be the only male  member
      of his family surviving, I do not believe the Shtefni family will rest
      until they have killed him.

   I have the following comments to make on the Home  Office's  Reasons  for
   Refusal, using its own paragraph numbering:

   5.       I do not believe that it is alleged that the Albanian police are
      complicit in or support incidents of murder but it is noteworthy  that
      they failed to apprehend Mr. Koci' s  father  after  his  very  public
      shooting of the two Shtefni men.

   6-9 While  it  is  true  that  great  strides  have  been  taken  in  law
      enforcement since the breakdown 9. of  law  and  order  in  1997  (for
      example, travel  in  the  countryside  is  now  reasonably  safe  with
      brigandage suppressed) and a large number of weapons looted during the
      1997 anarchy have been recovered, it is not the case  that  government
      control has effectively been extended throughout Albania.  The  region
      of Tropoja in the north  east  is  only  partially  and  ineffectively
      controlled and there remains a very large number  of  guns  and  other
      weapons illicitly in private hands. Whatever the "clear up  rate"  for
      crimes  which  have   occurred,   the   police,   despite   continuing
      improvement, remain undertrained and undermanned, and their ability to
      prevent crime, particularly  crime  of  the  nature  contemplated,  is
      severely limited. The Secretary of State's view that Mr.  Koci  should
      seek protection from the Albanian authorities is quite impractical.
   ...
   2. If Mr. Koci were compelled to return to Albania he  would  be  at  the
      gravest risk of being killed by members  of  the  Shtefni  family.  He
      would live in constant fear and my belief is that he would  eventually
      be killed. Without wishing to sound melodramatic, I consider  that  if
      Mr. Koci were compelled to return to Albania this would be  tantamount
      to a sentence of death" I should also add that time is not a healer in
      matters of this kind. There has  been  at  least  one  case,  probably
      several, of a killing taking place after 1991 in revenge for one which
      took place in 1946, the victim being I believe the grandson of the one
      who originally "owed blood".
   3. Mr. Koci could expect no  specific  police  protection  because  of  a
      threat to his life and I do not believe that  he  could  rely  on  any
      effective general protection from the police.
   4. Albania is a small country - about the same size as Wales - and  I  do
      not believe there is any part in which he  could  rely  on  living  in
      safety. Of course, if he were to settle as far as  possible  from  the
      Lezha area, say in the south east, he would no doubt delay the day  of
      reckoning but I believe the Shtefni family would eventually find  him.
      Albania's small size and the  nature  of  its  society  with  extended
      family groups means that Mr. Koci' s  return  to  Albania  would  most
      probably be made known to the Shtefni  family  within  quite  a  short
      time.
7. We of course have the benefit of the October 2002 CIPU report, which  the
   adjudicator did not; but we have  to  take  full  account  of  that  (see
   Ravichandran [1996] Imm AR 97) in deciding whether  he  was  entitled  to
   accept what Mr Robertson said, quite so uncritically  as  he  appears  to
   have done.  Adjudicators  need  to  take  particular  care  to  reach  an
   independent view on evidence put before them by one side, when the  other
   is not represented, whichever side that is.

8. Turning to the other evidence to which we were referred  by  Mr  Rodwell,
   Amnesty International say in their report  for  2001  that,  though  ill-
   treatment by police of d�tenus was still common,and judicial  proceedings
   against those responsible infrequent, policemen had  been  committed  for
   trial, and at least three said to have  been  convicted  by  courts.  The
   State Department  say in theirs that there were still "many killings"  as
   the result of blood-feuds, though there had been a decrease  in  violence
   since the previous year. Most of the police "... still  remained  largely
   untrained ..." despite the continuing help given by foreign governments.

9. To set the problems in geographical context (see CIPU report  �  2),  the
   area of Albania is about 11,000 m� (so Mr Robertson  is  speaking  rather
   loosely when he describes it as "about the same  size  as  Wales",  which
   covers just over 8,000). The population is just over 3 million,  of  whom
   it is agreed about � million live in Tirana, the capital. The  claimant's
   regional centre of Lezh� is shown on his useful map:  the  scale  in  the
   'Times Atlas of the World'  makes clear it is no more than 40 miles north
   of Tirana as the crow flies, and perhaps 50 by road.

10. Mr Robertson is clearly conscious of some of the  implications  of  what
   he says, as shown by his remark about not wanting to sound  melodramatic.
   It would be cynical to suggest that was  a  vain  hope  in  dealing  with
   vendetta, which is the very stuff of melodrama; but both the problems  it
   causes, and any efforts made to cope with them, have to be looked  at  in
   the light of reality (if that is not too  trite  an  aspiration).What  Mr
   Robertson does not say is when he last visited Albania. This is always  a
   point of interest when one has to consider the  evidence  of  anyone  put
   forward as an expert on a particular country, and ought to  be  obviously
   so, if any thought were given to the rapidity of  change,  especially  in
   eastern Europe over the last decade. While we should be quite prepared to
   accept that the kanun vendetta system,  like  any  other,  is  very  much
   rooted in the past, the  same  may  not  apply  to  the  efforts  of  the
   authorities to deal with it.

11. The most relevant part of the CIPU report follows:


   6.130 The numbers of persons affected directly  or  indirectly  by  blood
   feuds vary widely. A survey  conducted  by  the  Law  Faculty  of  Tirana
   University in March 2000 showed that 210,000 Albanians (six per  cent  of
   the total population) were "affected"  by  blood  feuds  including  about
   1,250 people locked in their homes for fear of being killed. The Albanian
   Human Rights Group reported that during 2001, 2,750 families  were  self-
   imprisoned at home and that 900 children were  prevented  from  attending
   school due to fear of revenge. According to the Ministry of Public Order,
   more than 14 individuals were killed in  blood  feuds  in  2001.  Figures
   published by the National Mission for Blood Feud Reconciliation  [set  up
   in 1996: see � 6.126], in August 2000, stated that 756  blood  feuds  had
   been reconciled, allowing the people involved to return to put an end  to
   self-confinement at home. The missioners explained that the roots of this
   problem lie in the ill-intentioned interpretation of the Kanun and in the
   reluctance of citizens to obey the laws of the state. [5d][14b][24a]
   6.131  Several  agencies  provide  reconciliation  services  to  families
   involved in blood feuds, although according to the  International  Crisis
   Group there has been no concerted and  coordinated  strategy  devised  to
   combat this growing and deeply damaging phenomena.  The  Association  for
   Fraternisation  and  Reconciliation  aims  to  settle  disputes   between
   families  through  dialogue.  The   National   Reconciliation   Committee
   estimated it had resolved around 400 blood feuds  whilst  the  All-Nation
   Reconciliation Mission claimed it has succeeded  in  settling  about  600
   feuds. [24a]
   6.132 Albanian officials appear to have recognised the problems posed  by
   the Kanun and have pledged to address them. In August 1999, the  Albanian
   government dispatched 200  men  belonging  to  the  Tirana-based  special
   terrorist force RENEA to the northern district of Tropoja in an effort to
   curb lawlessness and gang violence  after  four  people  were  killed  in
   vendettas. The security forces arrested 22 people  suspected  of  murder,
   armed robbery or theft, and  seized  large  quantities  of  weaponry  and
   stolen vehicles.

12. The CIPU quote Mr Robertson (see � 6.128) as saying in March  2000  that
   "... to incorporate any special provisions dealing  with  blood-feuds  in
   the Criminal Code would be seen as a retrograde step in Albania by giving
   official recognition to an archaic custom." We have no doubt he is  right
   about that, and that this is a perfectly sensible view to take. There  is
   provision (see � 6.129) for premeditated murder (as a blood-feud  killing
   would almost always be) to be punished with 15 - 25 years'  imprisonment,
   rising to life with aggravating circumstances. The  question  is  whether
   official willingness to enforce that law  is  now  capable  of  providing
   effective protection for potential victims of blood-feuds,  if  they  are
   prepared to enlist it.

13. Albania has of course had many problems since the fall of  Communism  in
   1991-92, which may have played their part in what the CIPU  report  at  �
   6.124  describes  as  the  re-emergence  of  blood-feuds,  especially  in
   northern Albania. Clearly this was seen  as  a  serious  problem  by  the
   authorities as early as 1996, when they set up the National  Mission  for
   Blood Feud Reconciliation. There have been  a  number  of  other  private
   initiatives, named at � 6.131:  between  them,  they  claim  considerable
   success in resolving blood-feuds peacefully. This is an extremely  worthy
   aspiration; but clearly it would not be enough on its own.

14. However, in August 1999 the government  (apparently  the  one  still  in
   office) showed itself well capable of taking a firm  hand  when  one  was
   needed: no doubt the CIPU meant to describe the apparently very effective
   force  they  sent  in  to  Tropoja  as  "anti-terrorist",   rather   than
   "terrorist". The ministry responsible, unlike the  State  Department   or
   Amnesty International, give an exact  figure  for  blood-feud  deaths  in
   2001. While even 14 is of course too many, the figure  is  a  more  solid
   basis for assessment of the problem than a vague "many"; and it does give
   some hope that it is not only officially-recognized, but kept track of.

15. If Mr Robertson had been provided with, or had taken the  initiative  to
   provide himself with the Home  Office's  up-to-date  views  in  the  CIPU
   report (as they have taken account of what he  has  said  on  a  previous
   occasion), and given reasons for maintaining his views, then the claimant
   would have been in a much stronger position. As it is, Mr  Robertson  was
   giving his own views against the background of what was certainly a  very
   general treatment of the law and order situation in the  refusal  letter.
   He said nothing about the National Mission for Blood Feud Reconciliation,
   or the various other initiatives; nor about  the  1999  Tropoja  campaign
   (even though he specifically deals with Tropoja at � 6-9, set  out  above
   at p 4).

16. We have to  regard  the  CIPU  report  as  a  very  much  more  balanced
   assessment of the present situation than  Mr  Robertson's  letter.  While
   blood-feuds clearly still represent a serious problem in  Albania,  there
   is clear evidence that the authorities, and others, are taking  effective
   steps to deal with it, by reconciliation where  possible,  and  by  armed
   suppression where necessary. In the light of the CIPU report, we  do  not
   consider the adjudicator justified in his  uncritical  acceptance  of  Mr
   Robertson's letter. We should consider him entitled to take the view (see
   his � 23, where as he says he is "briefly dealing  with  the  appellant's
   human rights") that having to live indefinitely in hiding might [make the
   claimant's return] amount to "inhuman or degrading treatment".  Our  view
   is that this sort of existence would not be necessary: even if a  measure
   of discretion were required when the claimant  first  went  back  (as  to
   where he went, and how he drew attention to himself), over the long  term
   effective protection, in terms of Horvath [2000] Imm AR 552  (HL),  would
   be available for him if he chose to seek it.
