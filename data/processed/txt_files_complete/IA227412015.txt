                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal  from  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Emerton, sitting at Taylor House, who in a decision promulgated on  4th
    October 2016 dismissed  Mr  Kendra  Shekhar  Dhakal's  appeal   against
    refusal of his application for an EEA residence card in recognition  of
    a retained right of residence.

 2. The brief background facts are that the Appellant, who is a citizen  of
    Nepal, was formerly married to [SP] who is a  Latvian  national.   They
    have a son together, [SD], who was born in the UK on [ ]  2007.   Their
    marriage was dissolved on 8th October 2012.

 3. At the relevant  time,  the  requirements  for  retaining  a  right  of
    residence following dissolution of a marriage to an EEA  national  were
    contained within Regulation 10 of the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006.  The only issue  in  the  appeal  before  Judge
    Emerton was whether, at the time of the dissolution of their  marriage,
    the Appellant's former wife had been exercising  treaty  rights  within
    the United Kingdom, either as a worker, a self-employed person, a self-
    sufficient person or as a student.

 4.  The  primary  facts  in  the  appeal  were  not  really  in   dispute.
    Relevantly, [SP] had become a full-time student nurse studying  at  the
    London South Bank University on a course that she was due  to  complete
    in 2014; that is to say, some eighteen months after the dissolution  of
    the marriage.  On the face of it, therefore, it  could  not  have  been
    plainer that she was exercising treaty rights as a  student.  This  was
    acknowledged by the judge at paragraph 20 of his decision:

         "The key initial point is whether the ex-spouse was exercising  EEA
         treaty rights at the date of the termination of the marriage namely
         on 8th October 2012".   Regulation  10(5)(b)  effectively  requires
         that she be a qualified person under Regulation 6 as  a  jobseeker,
         worker, self-employed person, self-sufficient person or a  student.
         Although self-evidently a "student" in  the  broader  sense  it  is
         accepted  that  the  ex-spouse  could  not  fulfil   the   specific
         requirements of Regulation 4(1)(d) and therefore  could  not  be  a
         qualified person for that reason".  [The  reference  to  Regulation
         4(1)(d) being presumably a reference to sub-Regulation  4(1)(d)  of
         Regulation 10].

 5. No clue is given in the decision as to why it was acknowledged that the
    appellant's former wife did not so qualify as  a  student.  However,  I
    have been told today that the reason  is  that  although  she  met  the
    threshold definition for a student (that is to say, she was following a
    course of study which included vocational training) she did not meet  -
    or, perhaps more accurately, there was no evidence that she met  -  the
    additional requirement of having comprehensive sickness insurance cover
    in the United Kingdom.  It  was  for  this  reason  that,  rather  than
    pursuing the more obvious course of  arguing  that  appellant's  former
    wife had been a "student",  it  was  argued  instead  that  she  was  a
    "worker".

 6. The argument that the appellant's former wife  was  a  "worker"  rested
    principally upon the fact that she was at all material times in receipt
    of a significant National Health Service bursary.  During the  academic
    year ending in 2011, this amounted to �9,767.50. In the following  year
    it  rose  to  �15,  435.68.   It  was  thus  argued  that  the  bursary
    represented payment for her work, an argument that Mr Coleman says  the
    judge was wrong to reject.

 7. In rejecting the argument that [SP] qualified as a "worker", the  judge
    referred to a number of documents each of which referred to  her  as  a
    "student".  Amongst those documents was a student exemption certificate
    in respect of Council Tax. This document referred to the fact [SP]  was
    taking an advanced diploma in adult nursing between 14th March 2011 and
    7th March 2014.  Another document was a university prospectus  for  her
    course. Under the heading 'Placements',  this  documents  contains  the
    following passage:

         "As an adult nursing student you will spend  approximately  50%  of
         your course on clinical placements  learning  from  qualifying  and
         experienced practitioners.   These  exciting  learning  experiences
         will provide you with the skills and experience to  become  a  safe
         and proficient adult nurse ... ".

 8. In his submissions before me today, Mr  Coleman  pressed  the  argument
    that the bursary was recognition by way of payment  for  the  practical
    work that [SP] had been undertaking  in  a  hospital  at  the  time  of
    dissolution  of  the  marriage.   However,  the  difficulty  with  this
    argument is  that  the  definitions  of  a  'bursary'  in  the  various
    dictionaries to which I have been referred, describe it as a 'gift'  or
    a 'grant' that is made for the purpose of enabling  study  rather  than
    consideration for work.  The fact that a  person  who  is  required  to
    undertake vocational training also receives a bursary does  not  in  my
    view alter his status from 'student' to  'worker'.  This  is  expressly
    recognised within the definition of a student in  Regulation  10(4)(d),
    which defines a student as, "a person who is enrolled for the principle
    purpose of following a course of study (including vocational  training)
    at a public or private establishment".  That is precisely what [SP] was
    doing at the date of the dissolution of the marriage.   The  fact  that
    she received a bursary in order to do so does not change the nature  of
    category of "qualified person" into which she fell.

 9. The above analysis represents my view of the law having heard the  able
    submissions of Mr Coleman. It  is  similar  if  not  identical  to  the
    reasoning of the First-tier Triubnal judge. Thus, at  paragraph  28  of
    his decision, Judge Emmerton said this:

         I  do  not  consider  that  the  information  about  the  ex-spouse
         receiving an NHS bursary makes her in some  way  a  "worker".   The
         bursary is clearly designed to encourage and enable people to study
         to become nurses not to reimburse them for what would otherwise  be
         unpaid NHS work.  The placement is clearly part of  the  study  not
         some sort of method of getting a worker on the cheap.  Ms Reid [who
         was  then  representing  the  Appellant]  has   put   together   an
         interesting and not entirely fanciful  argument  but  ultimately  I
         agree with Mr Deshraj [the Presenting Officer at the hearing]  that
         the ex-spouse was not  exercising  treaty  rights  as  a  qualified
         person at the relevant time.

10. It follows that the judge did not make an error of law in finding  that
    [SP] was not "a worker" at the time of the dissolution of the marriage.
     I canvassed with the parties whether the judge may alternatively  have
    made an error of law in not holding that [SP]  was  a  student  at  the
    material time.  However, in the absence of any evidence  that  she  had
    comprehensive sickness insurance whilst she was studying as  a  student
    nurse, I am satisfied that this did not amount to a discrete  error  of
    law.

11. The appeal therefore is dismissed.
