Firm Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of China, appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal
    against a decision of the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) of 25  February
    2014 to refuse her application for entry clearance to settle  with  her
    spouse, Wu Chen Yang (the sponsor), in  the  UK.   First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge P Telford dismissed  the  appeal.   The  appellant  appeals  with
    permission to this Tribunal.

 2. The background to this appeal is that the  appellant  and  the  sponsor
    married in China in March 1988, they registered their marriage there on
    12 August 1994. They claim to have two children born in 1989 and  1994.
    The sponsor came to the UK on 10 January 2000. The sponsor was  granted
    leave to remain under the legacy policy on 22  February  2011.  He  was
    naturalised as a British citizen on 12 July 2012. The appellant and the
    sponsor did not see each other again  until  the  sponsor  returned  to
    China in January 2013. The appellant applied for  entry  clearance  and
    that application was refused by the ECO on the basis that the appellant
    did not meet the requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.
    The ECO accepted that the marriage of the  appellant  and  the  sponsor
    continues as a legal formality but was not satisfied that there  is  an
    ongoing subsisting matrimonial relationship or that the parties  intend
    to live together permanently in the UK. The ECO also decided  that  the
    appellant did not meet the income threshold requirement of Appendix  FM
    and/or the related evidential requirements.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the marriage  is  not  genuine
    and subsisting finding that the lack of direct contact in 13 years  was
    a significant factor in his decision. The Judge found no reason why the
    sponsor would not have visited his family in all that  time  and  found
    that he had not shown that contact was maintained through the  internet
    or other avenues in any  meaningful  way.  The  Judge  found  that  the
    appellant had not shown that the sponsor sent financial amounts to such
    an extent that he could  not  afford  to  travel.  He  found  that  the
    appellant  had  not  translated  much  of  the  evidence  of   internet
    conversations. The Judge found that photographs of a relatively  recent
    one off visit to family and friends did not  discharge  the  burden  of
    proof on the appellant of proving  that  she  and  the  sponsor  had  a
    relationship in the 13 years and today. In relation  to  the  financial
    requirements the Judge found that the employer's  letter  provided  was
    not consistent with HMRC documents and did  not  properly  explain  the
    procedure in relation to tips and overtime. The Judge therefore  placed
    no weight on  the  employer's  letter  and  did  not  accept  that  the
    sponsor's income is at the required level.

Error of Law

 4. The appellant contends in the grounds of appeal that the Judge erred in
    focussing on the lack of contact  since  the  sponsor  left  China  and
    failing to consider the fact that the sponsor could not have  travelled
    to China as he was in the UK unregulated and  in  failing  to  consider
    whether the relationship was subsisting at the date of the decision. It
    is further contended that the Judge failed to assess  the  marriage  in
    its own cultural/factual  setting.  It  is  contended  that  the  Judge
    misdirected himself in relation to the financial evidence  in  that  he
    misread the P60 and did not appreciate HMRC rules in  relation  to  the
    payment of tips.

 5. The parties  were  in  agreement  that  the  relevant  period  for  the
    assessment of financial evidence was April - September 2013,  a  period
    of six months before the application for entry clearance. Mr Kannangara
    indicated that he was  not  pursuing  the  ground  of  appeal  alleging
    procedural unfairness arising from the fact that  the  ECO  issued  two
    decisions.

 6. The issue before me therefore is whether  the  Judge  made  a  material
    error in relation to the findings as to the subsistence of the marriage
    and as to the financial requirements.

 7. Mr Kannangara submitted that paragraph 14 of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's decision shows that the only reason for the  finding  that  the
    relationship is not subsisting is the fact that the couple did not  see
    each other for  13  years.  He  submitted  that  the  Judge  failed  to
    recognise the circumstances of this case in that the  sponsor  came  to
    the UK in 2000 and could not go to China whilst he was  an  overstayer.
    He submitted that the appellant did not hold  a  Chinese  passport  and
    could not therefore travel until he  obtained  a  British  passport  in
    October 2012. This submission ignores  the  fact,  put  forward  by  Mr
    Clarke, that the sponsor could have returned to China to his family. He
    was in the UK illegally from 2000  until  he  was  encountered  working
    illegally in 2009. It seems that he made an application for  indefinite
    leave to remain in 2005 and that indefinite leave to remain was granted
    in 2011. But he was not an asylum seeker  or  refugee  and  could  have
    returned to China at any time.  His  separation  from  his  family  was
    therefore by choice. He has not explained why he  could  not  obtain  a
    Chinese passport before or after he was  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain. There is no explanation as to why he did not obtain  a  Chinese
    passport and travel to China when he was granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in 2011.

 8. Mr Kannangara submitted that there was evidence of contact between  the
    appellant and the sponsor  during  the  13  years,  he  said  that  the
    evidence was in the form of calling cards but  he  accepted  that  they
    were not produced to the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  Judge  could  not
    consider evidence which was not before  him.  Mr  Kannangara  submitted
    that the sponsor had said in his witness statement  that  he  had  been
    sending money to his wife through friends and  acquaintances  until  he
    was able to open a bank account. However there was no evidence from the
    family and friends that they had taken money to the appellant from  the
    sponsor. Again the Judge did not  err  in  concluding  that  there  was
    insufficient evidence of financial transfers.

 9. Mr Kannangara submitted that the sponsor  has  travelled  to  China  on
    three occasions, from 9 January 2014 - 24 March 2013; from  27  January
    2014 - 2 March 2014; and from January -April 2015. However two of these
    visits were after the date of the decision appealed against.

10. It is clear from reading paragraph  14  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge did not  take  the  lack  of  visits  over  this  period  as  the
    determining  factor.  I  accept  Mr  Clarke's  submission  that  it  is
    appropriate to take account of  the  history  of  the  relationship  in
    assessing whether it is subsisting. The Judge refers  to  the  lack  of
    other evidence that the relationship was or is  subsisting.  The  Judge
    referred to the lack of evidence of financial transfers  and  the  fact
    that the sponsor had not translated the evidence of  internet  contact.
    The Judge could not have taken into account the untranslated  evidence.
    The Judge said that photographs of a relatively  recent  one  of  visit
    could not  alone  show  that  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  had  a
    relationship over the 13 years 'and today'. I am satisfied that  it  is
    clear that the First-tier Tribunal Judge considered all of the evidence
    in finding that the appellant  had  not  shown  that  the  marriage  is
    subsisting. In my view it is difficult to see how the Judge could  have
    approached the evidence any differently. The Judge made no error in his
    findings that the appellant had  not  demonstrated  that  she  met  the
    relationship requirements of Appendix FM.

11. Mr Kannangara submitted  that  the  Judge  erred  in  relation  to  his
    assessment of the financial evidence as  the  ECO  had  considered  the
    sponsor's earnings on the basis of 12 months earnings as shown in  HMRC
    documents rather than on the basis of six months earnings as  required.
    Mr Clarke accepted that the financial evidence was not  dealt  with  in
    depth by the First-tier Tribunal Judge. It is unclear whether the  HMRC
    documents referred to in the refusal notice were  actually  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge as they are not in the respondent's bundle.

12. I accept that the reasoning in relation to the  financial  requirements
    is unclear in light of the apparent lack of HMRC documents referred  to
    in the refusal notice. The payslips appear to  show  that  the  sponsor
    earned �9360 gross  during  the  relevant  period,  between  April  and
    September 2013. This would appear to meet the  financial  requirements.
    However it is also unclear what the HMRC documents say and whether  all
    of the specified evidence was provided. In these  circumstances  it  is
    unclear whether  the  appellant  has  demonstrated  that  she  met  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM at the date of the decision.

13. In any event I have found that there is no material error  in  relation
    to the findings as to  the  relationship  requirements.  Any  error  in
    relation to the financial requirements is accordingly not  material  to
    the decision to dismiss the appeal.

Conclusion

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of a material error on a point of law.

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall therefore stand.
