                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1.     The Appellant appealed to the  Upper  Tribunal  with  permission
         granted by First-tier Tribunal Lambert on 8 June 2015  against  the
         decision and reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge Shepherd who  had
         dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the refusal on 19 May 2014
         of her application for further  leave  to  remain  under  paragraph
         DVILR.1.1(d) and paragraph 289A  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
         decision and reasons was promulgated on 13 February 2015.

    2.     The Appellant is a national of Zambia, born on 24 February 1981.
          The Appellant had entered the United Kingdom on 26 October 2012 as
         the fiancï¿½e of Mr  Damon  Trott,  a  British  Citizen.   They  were
         married on 21 January 2013 and the Appellant  was  granted  further
         leave to remain as a spouse until 29 January 2015.  On 1 April 2014
         the Appellant applied for a variation of leave  as  the  victim  of
         domestic violence.  The  decree  absolute  was  pronounced  in  her
         divorce on 15 May 2014.

    3.     Permission to appeal was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Lambert because she considered (in summary) that  it  was  arguable
         that the judge's findings on the central issue of domestic violence
         were unclear and inadequate.

    4.     Standard directions were made by the tribunal,  indicating  that
         the appeal would be re-decided immediately if a material  error  of
         law were found.  A rule 24 notice in the form of a letter dated  17
         June 2015 had been filed on the Respondent's  behalf  opposing  the
         onwards appeal.

    Submissions

    5.     On the morning of the Upper Tribunal  hearing,  the  Appellant's
         representative  wrote  by  fax  to  the  tribunal   requesting   an
         adjournment.  Her representative stated that she had become  unwell
         following the birth of her baby in  recent  weeks.   She  had  been
         unable to arrange alternative representation at short notice.   She
         said that it would be prejudicial to the Appellant  to  proceed  in
         the absence of representation.

    6.     The Appellant  was  present  in  person  at  the  hearing.   The
         tribunal explained to her that the adjournment  was  refused.   The
         assertion that alternative representation had not been possible  to
         arrange at short notice was not accepted, however that  was  not  a
         matter in the Appellant's hands and she should not be and would not
         be prejudiced.  The issue for the tribunal to determine was whether
         there had been a material error of law, which was not a question to
         which  the  Appellant  could  contribute.    Her   representative's
         submissions were set out in the grounds of  onwards  appeal,  which
         the tribunal had read.  The real problem was that there was, in the
         tribunal's view, nothing of any substance in the grounds of appeal.
          The tribunal was accordingly not at all likely to be influenced or
         persuaded that any additional submissions on the Appellant's behalf
         might  change  the  position.    The   Appellant's   situation   of
         uncertainty would be needlessly prolonged by an  adjournment  which
         would serve no purpose, not to mention the  pointless  costs  which
         the Appellant would incur.

    7.     Mr Tufan for the Respondent relied on the rule  24  notice.   He
         submitted that there was no error of law and that the determination
         should stand.  The judge had set  out  in  detail  the  Appellant's
         evidence and had given entirely adequate reasons  for  her  adverse
         credibility findings, which were based in part on the discrepancies
         the judge had noted.  There was little of any independent value  in
         the evidence, which was mainly repetition of the Appellant's claims
         by third parties.  The grounds of appeal were simply an attempt  to
         reargue the appeal.

    8.     The tribunal indicated at the conclusion of submissions that  it
         would be finding that there was  no  material  error  of  law,  and
         reserved its determination, which now follows.

    No material error of law finding

    9.     The determination of  Judge  Shepherd  was  extremely  detailed,
         citing much of the evidence almost verbatim.   There  are  some  12
         paragraphs  recording  the  submissions  made  on  the  Appellant's
         behalf.  Sometimes judges who  provide  so  much  detail  from  the
         hearing then fail to provide sufficient reasons for their  ultimate
         decision, perhaps, as it were, having run out of steam.    No  such
         criticism  can,  however,  be  maintained   against   the   present
         determination.   It  seems  to  the  tribunal  that  the  grant  of
         permission to appeal was very generous and failed to recognise  the
         care with which the judge had reached her findings.

    10.    The grounds of appeal refer to the judge as "the IJ".  The title
         Immigration Judge has been obsolete since 2010.  The grounds sought
         at some length to show that the judge had  erred  in  reaching  her
         credibility findings.  The grounds repeatedly claim that the  judge
         should have believed the Appellant and given more weight to various
         items of evidence.   It  is  also  asserted  that  the  judge  gave
         evidence about the frequency of the contest of  divorce  petitions,
         whereas she should have found  that  the  absence  of  contest  was
         acceptance by the husband that the  allegations  against  him  were
         true.  By necessary implication the grounds seek that the  decision
         and reasons should be set aside and the appeal reheard  by  another
         judge.

    11.    All of the complaints made in  the  grounds  of  onwards  appeal
         amount to nothing more than expressions of  disagreement  with  the
         judge's decision, and fail to show any error of  law.   The  appeal
         turned on the Appellant's credibility and the  judge  set  out  her
         findings at [66] onwards, in a logical  order,  starting  with  the
         documents, which included police reports.  The judge had to  decide
         whether  the  short  lived   marriage   broke   down   because   of
         violence/abuse,  whether  physical  or  mental,  or  for   ordinary
         reasons.  The judge explained why she found  that  the  Appellant's
         evidence was exaggerated and  unreliable,  through  a  careful  and
         thoughtful analysis of the  evidence.   The  judge  did  not  "give
         evidence" about divorce petitions at  [78]  of  her  decision,  but
         rather gave simple and  sustainable  reasons  why  the  failure  to
         contest the petition could not be treated as an admission that  the
         Appellant's allegations about her husband  were  true.   The  judge
         could hardly have done more to explain why the appeal failed.

    12.    The tribunal accordingly holds that there was no material  error
         of law in the decision and  reasons  and  there  is  no  basis  for
         interfering with the judge's decision.

    DECISION

    The making of the previous decision did not involve the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law and stands unchanged
