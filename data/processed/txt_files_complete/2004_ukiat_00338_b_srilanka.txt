Representation
For the appellant:           Miss  R.  Brown,  Home  Office  Presenting
Officer
For the respondent :   Miss P. Gandhi of Counsel,
                       instructed by Chelvathamby & Sons

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Secretary of State appeals with leave against  the  determination
      of an Adjudicator allowing the appellant's appeal against his refusal
      to recognise him as a refugee.  The  Tribunal   confirmed  with  Miss
      Gandhi the core facts which the Adjudicator  is  to  be  regarded  as
      having found. The appellant was by  occupation  a  tailor,  who  made
      clothes for the Tigers and repaired them from time to time.   He  was
      forced to  undergo   combat  training,  but  his   combat  experience
      consisted mostly of carrying a  few  shells  and  he  never  actually
      fought for the Tigers.  He was, however, injured  at  the  front  and
      whilst he was recovering was allowed to rest and train other  tailors
      for the Tigers.

   2. Shortly after that he travelled to the Vanni which was  then  in  Sri
      Lankan government  hands. He appears to have been  safe  there  until
      the Sri Lankan government captured Jaffna and the LTTE  moved to  the
      Vanni at which time he was arrested by the LTTE.

   3. When released he headed for Vavuniya where he was arrested by  PLOTE.
      At this point in the  story  there  is  considerable  confusion.  The
      appellant was either released by PLOTE in March 1999 or in  May  2000
      and he either arrived in the UK in January 2000 or in  October  2000.
      During the period between his release and his departure the appellant
      lived with his sister in Anuradhapura, which is in the middle of  Sri
      Lanka, apparently right on the cusp of the combat zone.

   4. Be that as it may, he seems to have had  no  difficulties  there  and
      after a period managed to save up enough money for his passage to the
      UK.  Shortly after his departure, his  parents  in  Trincomalee  were
      questioned about his whereabouts. (His wife is still in Mulamkalvil.)
       The appellant   is  in  contact  by  letter  with  his  parents  and
      presumably also with  his  wife  and  sister  although  there  is  no
      evidence to that effect.

   5. He was released by PLOTE on payment of a bribe  and  apart  from  the
      visit to his parents just after the release there is no  evidence  of
      any  continuing  interest.   The  Prevention  of  Terrorism  Act  and
      Emergency Regulations, which are the only provisions under  which  an
      innocent tailor could be arrested and held  as  this  appellant  was,
      have both lapsed and the peace process in Sri Lanka has  altered  the
      situation there beyond recognition.

   6. The Tribunal has been taken  to  2003  UKIAT  00150  N  (Sri  Lanka),
      Oppilamani [2004] EWHC 348, 2003 UKIAT  00003  S  (Sri  Lanka),  2004
      UKIAT 00033 B (Sri  Lanka),  all  of  which  confirm  the  change  in
      circumstances.  There is  nothing  exceptional  in  this  appellant's
      situation to suggest that he would still be at risk on return and  no
      specific information after the month or so  after  his  departure  to
      indicate that such risk as there may then have been continues today.

   7. It follows that  the  Adjudicator's   determination  cannot,  on  the
      present facts, be sustained and  that  the  Secretary  of  State   is
      entitled to succeed. This appeal is accordingly allowed.
