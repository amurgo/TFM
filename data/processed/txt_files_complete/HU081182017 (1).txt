Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Miss K Stein, Advocate, instructed by MT UK,
                    Solicitors, Twickenham


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as above, but for continuity the rest of this  decision
    refers to them as they were in the FtT.

 2. The SSHD's decision dated 18 July 2017 is structured thus:

         Immigration history;

         Criminal history;

         Legal context - articles 8 (1)  and  (2)  ECHR,  immigration  rules
         �A362, A398 - 399D, 2002 Act part 5A;

         Evidence submitted by appellant;

         Offending  considered  to  have  caused  serious  harm,   therefore
         deportation required under �398, subject to  exceptions  under  399
         and 399A;

         Family and private life - wife and 5 children, all UK citizens;

         Duty on best interests of children under s. 55 2002 Act;

         �399(a) - genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  accepted;
         not accepted 2 younger children would have difficulty  adapting  to
         Pakistan; accepted unduly harsh to expect 3 older children to  live
         in Pakistan; not accepted unduly harsh for any of the  children  to
         remain in the UK without appellant;

         �399(b) - genuine and subsisting family life  with  wife  accepted;
         relationship not formed while appellant in UK, but in Pakistan; not
         unduly harsh for wife to live in Pakistan if she chose, due to both
         having extensive family ties there; not unduly harsh  for  wife  to
         remain in UK without appellant;

         �399A, private life - appellant not lawfully resident most  of  his
         life; not socially and culturally integrated; no  very  significant
         obstacles to integration into Pakistan;

         No exceptions to deportation therefore apply;

         No very compelling circumstances, over and  above  the  exceptions;
         offending as taxi driver  against  two  young  lone  females  under
         influence of alcohol; no acceptance of responsibility; medium  risk
         of  reconviction;  nothing  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
         deportation.

 3. The appellant's grounds of appeal to the UT disagree on undue harshness
    and assert that the children's best interests would be to remain in the
    UK with both parents; the public interest is "not as strong as in  most
    deportation cases"; although the offences were  serious,  the  sentence
    was "relatively low"; the history is "not that of a prolific offender";
    he is not liable for "automatic deportation" because his  sentence  was
    not in excess of 12 months; the public interest is important but not  a
    trump card.

 4. FtT  Judge  Kempton  allowed  the  appellant's  appeal  by  a  decision
    promulgated on 24 November 2017.

 5. The SSHD has permission to appeal to the UT on 2 grounds.

 6. Ground 1 is that the judge misdirected herself by placing undue  weight
    on rehabilitation above more pressing aspects of  the  public  interest
    such as deterrence and public abhorrence.

 7. Ground 2 is  that  the  judge  failed  to  identify  any  unduly  harsh
    circumstances to outweigh the public interest in deportation -  nothing
    beyond separation and emotional upset, and no compelling circumstances.

 8. Mrs O'Brien relied upon the grounds and made further submissions.   The
    points I noted were these:

      i) The judge took too narrow a  view  of  the  nature  of  the  public
         interest and how it could be diminished.

     ii) Although the decision set out the legal scheme of deportation,  its
         critical parts showed misunderstanding of it.  At  �34  -  35,  the
         judge thought that the appellant had to show that both  the  family
         and  the  private  life  exceptions   applied,   when   those   are
         alternatives.

    iii) The respondent's decision was based  on  �398  (c)  of  the  rules,
         offending which had caused serious harm,  and  which  had  involved
         breach of trust.  The judge failed to appreciate the nature of  the
         offending, and the evidence before her which reflected no change in
         the appellant's attitudes, shown by non-acceptance of guilt.

     iv) At �38 - 42 the judge looked at the matter almost entirely in terms
         of accepting rehabilitation, which became her principal reason  for
         allowing the appeal, when that was inconsistent with  the  evidence
         and her own findings.

      v)  �40,  "requires  to  become  rehabilitated  and  to   avoid   such
         opportunistic circumstances again", was contrary to not  in  favour
         of effective rehabilitation.

     vi) �41, no risk "as long as he is not put into circumstances where  he
         could take advantage of vulnerable females", similarly went against
         the appellant not in his favour.

    vii) Such reasoning as there was did not support the conclusion  at  �41
         that the appellant had learned from his mistakes and his  behaviour
         was unlikely to be repeated.

   viii) Even if the low risk finding had been justified, that was only part
         of the public interest, and should not have been thought  decisive.
         Revulsion and deterrence were also relevant.

     ix) The narrow view of the public interest taken by the judge suggested
         that it was tolerable to engage in sexual abuse of vulnerable young
         women.

      x) There was no basis for the finding that separation of the  children
         from the appellant would be unduly harsh.  The test was  a  serious
         one.  Nothing in the evidence went beyond the fact of separation or
         could meet the threshold.  The factors set out  at  �34  were  only
         those standard in any case.

     xi) The decision of the FtT should be reversed.

 9. The appellant filed a rule 24 response to the grant of  permission,  in
    summary on these lines:

         'The public interest does  not  automatically  outweigh  all  other
         considerations.  The case law does not state that public  revulsion
         and  deterrence  are  the  most  important  facets  of  the  public
         interest.  It is one factor in a fair balancing exercise, which the
         judge carried out.  Ground 1 is only disagreement.

         VC (Sri Lanka) [2017] EWCA Civ 1967 and Home  Office  Guidance  are
         cited  on  the  best  interests  of  children  in  cases  involving
         criminality.  Relationships and emotional ties are key but not  the
         only factor.  The judge had regard "to the  developmental  progress
         of the children as affected by the appellant's  absence"  at  [11],
         their schooling [14]  and  nursery  [23],  financial  stressors  in
         absence of the breadwinner [24], the health impact on  the  younger
         children [24] and documentary evidence from Glasgow City Health and
         Social Care [24].   Proper  consideration  was  given  to  all  the
         evidence and circumstances in concluding  at  [37]  and  [42]  that
         removal would be unduly harsh.  The position of the  appellant  was
         included in the balancing exercise as required by Mirza [2015] CSIH
         28 and Khan [2015] CSIH 29.  The judge gave appropriate  weight  to
         the correct factors.  Ground 2 also is only disagreement.'

10. Ms Stein relied upon the  foregoing.  In  oral  submissions  she  dealt
    firstly with ground 2.  The further points which I noted were these:

      i) There had to be some sets of circumstances which met the  criterion
         of serious hardship.  This case was one of them.

     ii) There had been evidence before the FtT to justify  the  conclusions
         based on the well-being of the children.  Most significantly,  this
         came in a letter from a health visitor dated 23 October  2017,  and
         so was very up to date at the  time  of  the  hearing.   The  judge
         refenced this at �6, 33, 34 and 37.

    iii) The appellant's wife gave evidence along similar lines.

     iv) The judge thus identified evidence going over and above  the  usual
         emotional impact of separation.

      v) It might have been proportionate for the appellant to have  to  put
         up with separation, but not for his wife and children to have to do
         so.

     vi) The threshold was high, but it  had  been  met,  not  just  by  lip
         service, as the respondent  submitted,  but  specifically,  at  the
         paragraphs cited in the response.

    vii) The undue harshness finding was sound.  It is well established that
         children are not to be penalised for the faults of their parents.

   viii) The decision was  also  justified  by  the  inevitable  effects  of
         separation on the appellant's wife.  She would  be  left  alone  to
         look after five children and deprived of financial support.

     ix) On ground 1, the judge had taken  a  painstaking  approach  to  the
         public interest.  The elements of serious harm and  revulsion  were
         built in.

      x) The seriousness of the crime was to be taken as exactly measured by
         the 9 months sentence, only 6 of which were served before release.

     xi) The essence of the  judgement  was  that  the  seriousness  of  the
         offending was outweighed by the needs of spouse and children.

    xii) The judge dealt correctly with the  risk  of  reoffending.   A  low
         level of risk was a significant starting point.  That was confirmed
         by all 3 of the reports which had been before  the  FtT,  including
         the most recent one, which came after the respondent's decision.

   xiii) The judge's finding was justified by evidence she recorded at  �21,
         which showed that the appellant was avoiding risky situations.

    xiv) The decision was reached through a thorough balancing exercise, and
         should stand.

     xv) If the decision was set aside, the case was apt for the UT to  make
         a fresh decision based on all the materials.  For all  the  reasons
         advanced on his behalf, any fresh decision should be in  favour  of
         the appellant.

11. I reserved my decision.

12. Although cases are cited  in  the  pleadings  of  both  sides,  neither
    representative referred in submissions to any particular  passage,  and
    neither suggested that the case law is in any state of controversy.

13. In Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60 Lord Reed JSC, with whom the rest  of  the
    Court agreed, said at �50:

         "The critical issue for the tribunal  will  generally  be  whether,
         giving due weight to the strength of the  public  interest  in  the
         deportation of the  offender  ...  the  article  8  case  claim  is
         sufficiently strong to outweigh it.  In general, only a claim which
         is very strong indeed - very compelling, as it was put  in  the  MF
         (Nigeria) case - will succeed."

14. The FtT's decision sets out the rules and  statute  about  deportation,
    but then appears to engage in a broad balancing exercise,  rather  than
    saying where its findings fit within the legal framework.

15. The judge's  reasons  appear  at  �37,  unduly  harsh  consequences  of
    separation of children from appellant; 38, more recent risk assessments
    in low ranges; 39, despite some evidence directed to the contrary,  the
    fact of guilt was "the starting point in this  appeal";  40,  need  for
    appellant  to  become  rehabilitated  and  "avoid  such   opportunistic
    circumstances again"; 41, appellant's children not at risk from him; no
    further risk "as long as not put into circumstances where he could take
    advantage of vulnerable females"; has learned  from  his  mistakes  and
    behaviour unlikely to be repeated; 42,  appellant  had  benefited  from
    "his incarceration and rehabilitation programme"; a supportive  family,
    who would be the ones who would suffer if he had to leave; not easy for
    any of them to pick up their lives in the  UK  or  make  new  lives  in
    Pakistan if he were deported.

16. There is a rather flimsy basis for the judge's eventual view of  little
    risk.  It was contradicted by  the  matters  she  set  out  immediately
    before.  In  the  statement  which  formed  his  evidence-in-chief  the
    appellant said at �40 that he was "entirely remorseful" but in the next
    sentence that he believed he "was not involved in any  wrong  doing  in
    the last sexual offence."  He does appear to have accepted guilt in his
    oral evidence, as recorded at �22.

17. The SSHD in ground 1 cites cases on the limited weight to be  given  to
    rehabilitation.    The principles relied upon  have  been  applied  and
    approved in many reported instances, most recently in Olarewaju v  SSHD
    [2018] EWCA Civ 557:

          1.  The  Court  of   Appeal   addressed   the   significance   of
             rehabilitation in Taylor v Home Secretary [2015] EWCA Civ 845.
             Moore-Bick LJ, with whom McCombe and Vos LJJ agreed, said  (in
             paragraph 21):

                  "I would certainly not wish to diminish the importance  of
                  rehabilitation in itself, but the cases in  which  it  can
                  make  a  significant  contribution  to  establishing   the
                  compelling  reasons  sufficient  to  outweigh  the  public
                  interest in deportation are likely to be  rare.  The  fact
                  that rehabilitation has begun but is as yet incomplete has
                  been held in general not to be a relevant factor:  see SE
                  (Zimbabwe)   v   Secretary   of   State   for   the   Home
                  Department [2014]  EWCA  Civ  256 and PF  (Nigeria)  v
                  Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ
                  596. Moreover, as was  recognised  in SU  (Bangladesh)  v
                  Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ
                  427, rehabilitation is relevant primarily to the reduction
                  in the risk of re-offending. It is less  relevant  to  the
                  other factors which contribute to the public  interest  in
                  deportation."

          1. With regard to that last  sentence,  in OH  (Serbia)  v  Home
             Secretary [2008] EWCA Civ 694, [2009] INLR 109, Wilson LJ (as
             he  then  was)  derived  (in  paragraph  15)   the   following
             propositions from earlier case-law:

                  "(a) The risk of reoffending is one facet  of  the  public
                  interest but, in the case of very serious crimes, not  the
                  most important facet.

                  (b)  Another important facet is the need to deter  foreign
                  nationals from committing serious crimes by  leading  them
                  to understand that, whatever the other circumstances,  one
                  consequence of them may well be deportation.

                  (c)   A  further  important  facet  is  the  role   of   a
                  deportation order as an expression of society's  revulsion
                  at serious crimes and in building public confidence in the
                  treatment of foreign citizens who have  committed  serious
                  crimes.

                  (d)  Primary responsibility for the public interest, whose
                  view of it is likely to be wider and better informed  than
                  that  of  a  tribunal,  resides  in  the  respondent   and
                  accordingly  a  tribunal  hearing  an  appeal  against   a
                  decision to deport should not only consider for itself all
                  the facets of the public interest but should weigh,  as  a
                  linked but  independent  feature,  the  approach  to  them
                  adopted by the respondent in the context of the  facts  of
                  the  case.  Speaking  for  myself,  I  would  not  however
                  describe the tribunal's  duty  in  this  regard  as  being
                  higher than 'to weigh' this feature."

             In Ali v Home Secretary, Lord Wilson JSC said  (at  paragraph
             70) that he now regretted his reference in  sub-paragraph  (c)
             to society's "revulsion"  (that  being,  he  considered,  "too
             emotive a concept to figure in this analysis"), but he adhered
             to the view that he was "entitled to refer to  the  importance
             of public confidence in our determination of these issues".

18. Miss Stein submitted that the weight attached by the judge to low  risk
    of re-offending was within her scope, but I am unable to agree.  Ground
    1 shows that in giving this matter significant  or  even  near-decisive
    weight, the judge went against the well-settled  case  law.  There  was
    nothing to make this one of those rare instances  where  rehabilitation
    weighed significantly in the appellant's favour.

19. I turn to ground 2.

20. The appellant's case turned on showing that it would  be  unduly  harsh
    for his children or his wife to remain in the UK without him - �399 (a)
    of the rules, or exception 2 of s.117C.

21. The SSHD cites AJ (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 1012:

          1. More recently, this  court  considered  a  number  of  appeals
             together in NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
             Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662. In some of the cases sentences
             of between 12 months and four years had been imposed.  Jackson
             LJ, delivering the judgment of the court (Jackson,  Sharp  and
             Sales LJJ) made this observation with respect to the interests
             of the children in the context of "exceptional  circumstances"
             (paras.33-34):

                  "..... it inexorably follows  from  the  statutory  scheme
                  that the cases in  which  circumstances  are  sufficiently
                  compelling  to  outweigh  the  high  public  interest   in
                  deportation will be rare.  The  commonplace  incidents  of
                  family life, such as ageing parents in poor health or  the
                  natural love between parents and  children,  will  not  be
                  sufficient.

                  The best  interests  of  children  certainly  carry  great
                  weight,  as  identified  by  Lord  Kerr  in HH  v  Deputy
                  Prosecutor of the Italian Republic [2012] UKSC 25; [2013]
                  1 AC 338 at [145]. Nevertheless, it is a  consequence  of
                  criminal conduct that  offenders  may  be  separated  from
                  their children  for  many  years,  contrary  to  the  best
                  interests of those children. The desirability of  children
                  being with both parents is a commonplace of  family  life.
                  That is not usually a sufficiently compelling circumstance
                  to outweigh the high public interest in deporting  foreign
                  criminals..."

             The  court  then  cited  with  approval  the  observations  of
             Rafferty LJ in para. 38 of the CT (Vietnam) case, reproduced
             in para.14 above.

          1. These cases show that it will be rare for the  best  interests
             of the children to outweigh  the  strong  public  interest  in
             deporting foreign criminals. Something  more  than  a  lengthy
             separation  from  a  parent  is  required,  even  though  such
             separation is detrimental to the child's best interests.  That
             is commonplace and not a compelling circumstance.  Neither  is
             it looking at the concept of exceptional circumstances through
             the lens of the Immigration  Rules.  It  would  undermine  the
             specific exceptions in the  Rules  if  the  interests  of  the
             children in maintaining a  close  and  immediate  relationship
             with the deported parent were as a matter of course  to  trump
             the  strong  public  interest  in  deportation.  Rule   399(a)
             identifies the particular circumstances where it  is  accepted
             that the interests of  the  child  will  outweigh  the  public
             interest in deportation. The conditions are onerous  and  will
             only rarely arise. They include the requirement that it  would
             not be reasonable for the child to leave the UK  and  that  no
             other family member is able to look after the child in the UK.
             In  many,  if  not  most,  cases  where  this   exception   is
             potentially engaged there will be the normal  relationship  of
             love  and  affection  between  parent  and  child  and  it  is
             virtually always in the best interests of the child  for  that
             relationship to  continue.  If  that  were  enough  to  render
             deportation a disproportionate interference with family  life,
             it would drain the rule  of  any  practical  significance.  It
             would   mean   that    deportation    would    constitute    a
             disproportionate  interference  with  private  life   in   the
             ordinary run of cases where children  are  adversely  affected
             and the carefully framed conditions in rule  399(a)  would  be
             largely otiose.  In  order  to  establish  a  very  compelling
             justification  overriding  the   high   public   interest   in
             deportation, there must be some additional feature or features
             affecting the nature or quality of the relationship which take
             the case out of the ordinary.

22. The height of the evidence to which Miss Stein referred was a report of
    a home visit when the two younger children were  quiet,  withdrawn  and
    clingy to their mother, who said there had been some  regression  while
    their father was in custody, and improvement since his return.

23. The judge made no finding, and  indeed  there  was  no  evidence,  that
    anything in this case went beyond the usual incidents  of  family  life
    and of separation  from  a  parent  (either  in  the  past,  while  the
    appellant was imprisoned, or looking ahead).

24. Ground 2 demonstrates, again by reference to  well  settled  case  law,
    that in this respect also there was no lawful basis for the  conclusion
    reached by the FtT.

25. The SSHD's appeal to the UT is upheld on both grounds.  The decision of
    the FtT is set aside.   The case discloses no compelling claim.   There
    is nothing which significantly diminishes the weight to be given to the
    public interest.  There is no additional feature affecting  the  nature
    and quality of the family relationships.   The  appeal,  as  originally
    brought by the appellant to the FtT, is dismissed.

26. The anonymity direction made by the FtT is preserved.
