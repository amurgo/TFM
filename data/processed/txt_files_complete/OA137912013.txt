Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Murphy - Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                      DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal by Mrs Diasonama Jeanine Landu, a citizen of  the
         Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) born 20th  December  1963.   She
         appeals against the decision of the Respondent made on  10th  April
         2013 to refuse entry clearance under Appendix FM of the Immigration
         Rules.  The Appellant appealed against that decision and  following
         a hearing  on 25th April 2014,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mailer
         allowed the appeal on human rights grounds  having  relied  on  the
         decision of the Upper Tribunal MM v Secretary of State for the Home
         Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin).  The  Respondent  was  granted
         permission to appeal against that decision  and  on  4th  September
         2014 having heard submissions I found  that  the  determination  of
         Judge Mailer contained a material error  of  law  and  I  set  that
         decision aside with no preserved findings of fact.

      2. I now proceed to remake the decision.

      3. The facts of this case are the Appellant's husband fled the DRC  in
         1992 and is now a British citizen.  He  married  the  Appellant  in
         June 2012.  The application, the decision on which is  the  subject
         of this appeal, was made  on  26th  March  2013  so  the  financial
         requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules had to be  met
         at that date.  In his statement the Sponsor sets out  his  earnings
         as at that date from both self-employment and a job with a cleaning
         firm.  These earnings were �14,651  and  �2,551  respectively,  the
         total being below the level required by Appendix FM.  His  earnings
         from March 2013 to March 2014 were higher and do  reach  the  level
         required by Appendix FM.

      4. At the hearing before me Mr Murphy relied  on  a  profit  and  loss
         account produced by an accountant in London. This showed  a  'Gross
         Sales' figure of �14,651.29 and a Net Sales' figure of �10,614. The
         submission of Mr Murphy was that if the gross figure of  �14,651.29
         is added to the Sponsor's other income the minimum requirements  of
         Appendix FM are met.  I put it to Mr Murphy that the  gross  figure
         did not represent the Sponsor's income from  the  business  because
         the true income from the business was the profit - i.e.  the  sales
         figure after deduction of the expenses of running the business.  We
         had some discussion about this.  There is a requirement in Appendix
         FM-SE which is in the main silent as  to  what  constitutes  "gross
         income" in relation to a self-employed person. Appendix FM-SE  does
         however require that each applicant provide monthly  personal  bank
         statements for the same twelve month  period  as  the  tax  returns
         showing that the income from self-employment has been paid into  an
         account in the name of the person or in the name of the person  and
         their partner jointly.  Mr Murphy asked for time to  check  whether
         the statements produced showed this.  I gave him a week to  provide
         this and a week for Mr Melvin to provide any response required.   I
         have received nothing from Mr Murphy.  He  made  the  analogy  with
         someone paying their bus fares, travel expenses etc. to work out of
         their gross income and then having a net income.  I  do  not  think
         that running a business is the same.  The expenses shown do include
         travel and  fares  but  there  is  also  printing  and  stationery,
         accountancy fees etc. and  the  �10,614  is  referred  to  as  "net
         profit".  The requirement in Appendix FM-SE that I have referred to
         above is as stated for personal bank statements to be provided.  If
         as is generally the case, a business account is  used,   the  gross
         income figure will not be shown in the personal account because the
         business expenses will come out of the business  account  and  only
         the net amount would be available to the Sponsor.  It seems  to  me
         that a gross sales figure and gross income from self employment are
         not and cannot be the same thing. In any event  the  Appellant  has
         not provided the evidence required by Appendix FM-SE.

      5. With reference to Article 8 Mr Murphy submitted that  the  marriage
         is genuine.  The Sponsor is now  earning  well  in  excess  of  the
         minimum required.  A fresh application would  cost  �1,000  and  to
         expect the Appellant to pay this is utterly disproportionate.

      6. Mr Melvin submitted that there  is  no  evidence  of  family  life.
         There are only a few emails.  The marriage may  be  subsisting  but
         there is nothing compelling in  the  circumstances  of  either  the
         Appellant or the Sponsor that would warrant engagement  of  Article
         8.  The Appellant could make another application.

      7. In response Mr Murphy said that the Sponsor has  children  in  this
         country  with  whom  he  has  regular  contact  and  it  would   be
         disproportionate to expect him to move to the DRC to live with  his
         wife.  There are insurmountable obstacles to him moving.

    My findings

      8. I find that the Appellant has not established that in the  relevant
         period he  had  sufficient  income  to  meet  the  requirements  of
         Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE.  He cannot therefore succeed  under
         the Immigration Rules. Mr Murphy submitted that the  appeal  should
         succeed under Article 8 ECHR as the refusal of leave to enter gives
         rise to  a  disproportionate  interference  with  the  family  life
         between the Appellant and Sponsor. The position of  Mr  Melvin  was
         that there is no evidence of family life  but  I  accept  that  the
         couple are married and that there is family life between them.

      9. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) the Tribunal said,

             "... (b) after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if
             there may be arguably  good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to
             remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes  to
             go on to consider whether there are  compelling  circumstances
             not sufficiently recognised under them: R (on the  application
             of) Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]
             EWHC 720 (Admin);"

     10. I note that the Sponsor came to the UK in 1992 as  a  refugee  from
         DRC and made a successful claim for asylum. In 1995  his  wife  was
         murdered in DRC and two of his sons joined him in the UK  in  1996.
         These boys are now adults but  the  Sponsor  still  sees  them  and
         spends time with them. He remarried in 2001. That marriage ended in
         divorce but produced three daughters, twins who at the date of  the
         hearing before the First-tier Tribunal were 12 years old  and  a  9
         year-old. The Sponsor sees his daughters regularly at weekends  and
         they sometimes stay over. There is not a lot of evidence before  me
         of the Sponsor's family and private life in the UK but his  account
         was not disputed and it does seem to me that the  focus  throughout
         this appeal has been on assertions that the financial  requirements
         are met. I accept that he has a close relationship in the  UK  with
         his five children. I must assume that the three girls in particular
         benefit greatly from the relationship they have with  their  father
         and that it is in their best interests that  that  relationship  is
         not taken from them. In all the circumstances I find that there are
         insurmountable obstacles to the Sponsor moving to DRC to live  with
         the Appellant.

     11. In MM & Ors, R (On the Application Of) v Secretary of State for the
         Home Department (Rev 1) [2014] EWCA Civ 985 the view was taken that
         it is necessary to apply a "proportionality test"  with  regard  to
         the "exceptional circumstances" guidance in order to be  compatible
         with the (human rights) Convention and in compliance with  Huang  &
         Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2005]  EWCA  Civ
         105.

     12. Recent amendments to the Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
         2002 require  a  decision  maker  considering  Article  8  ECHR  to
         consider the public interest and set out  relevant  factors  to  be
         taken into account.
             117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in
             all cases
             (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
             the public interest.
             (2)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
             interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak English, because persons who can speak
             English-
                  (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
                  (b) are better able to integrate into society.
             (3)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
             interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-
                  (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
                  (b) are better able to integrate into society.
             (4)  Little weight should be given to-
                  (a) a private life, or
                  (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
                  that is established by a person at a time when the person
                  is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.
             (5) Little weight should be given to a private life
             established by a person at a time when the person's
             immigration status is precarious.
             (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
             the public interest does not require the person's removal
             where-
                  (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and
                  (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                  leave the United Kingdom.

     13. I have of course  found  that  the  Appellant  does  not  meet  the
         financial requirements of the Immigration  Rules  and  must  accept
         that the ethos of the Rules is that  the  public  interest  demands
         that people coming into the UK can be financially supported at  the
         required level.

     14. It  was  submitted  by  Mr  Melvin  that  here  are  no  compelling
         circumstances in this case that warrant consideration of Article 8.
         He said that a fresh application could be made. Mr Murphy submitted
         that in the circumstances that  it  is  clear  that  the  financial
         requirements  of  the  Rules  can  now   be   met   it   would   be
         disproportionate to expect the Appellant to pay the application fee
         of around �1000. I must agree with Mr Melvin. The Appellant  simply
         did not meet the financial requirements of  the  Rules.  Article  8
         cannot be used to get round that especially in  a  situation  where
         the circumstances of the Sponsor has changed and the Rules can  now
         be met. I do not accept that having to  pay  the  fee  for  another
         application is disproportionate or that in  all  the  circumstances
         the decision gives rise to  a  disproportionate  interference  with
         family life. I would say that I have taken into  account  the  fact
         that the Sponsor has visited DRC and could presumably do  so  again
         if necessary.
