Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Mohsin, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, Mr Imran Idris, is a citizen of Pakistan whose  date  of
    birth is 13 August 1990.  He made an application to vary his leave as a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant on 12 December  2012.   That  application
    was refused by the Secretary of  State  on  20  May  2013  because  the
    appellant was unable to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.



2.   At the time of that decision the appellant had extant  leave.   He  had
    been granted leave as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant which was valid  until
    11 April 2014 and he did not have a right of appeal under Section 82 of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act.")

3.   He made an application  for  leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules  on
    compassionate grounds on the basis that he had  a  pending  application
    for judicial review against the decision of the Secretary of  State  of
    20 May 2013.  This application was refused by the Secretary of State on
    12 June 2014 with a right of appeal.  The  appellant  appealed  against
    the decision of 12 June 2014 and his appeal was dismissed by the First-
    tier Tribunal (a panel comprising Designated Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal D  Taylor  and  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Manyarara)  in  a
    decision of 24 November 2014 following a hearing on 19 November 2014.

4.   The First-tier Tribunal had before them  an  appellant's  bundle  which
    contained the appellant's witness statement. There was also a  copy  of
    the appellant's application for  judicial  review  of  17  March  2014.
    There was a  copy  of  the  decision  of  20  September  2014  granting
    permission for judicial review in which it is stated that  to  continue
    proceedings a further fee is required or the  appellant  must  make  an
    application for fee remission.  A  substantive  hearing  had  not  been
    listed and the appellant accepted that  he  had  not  paid  a  fee.  In
    evidence he referred to a letter he had sent to the Upper Tribunal.

5.   The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal for the following  reasons
    at [15] of the determination. They found that there were no  compelling
    reasons why the appellant should  be  allowed  to  remain  outside  the
    Immigration Rules. They found  that  the  appellant  was  not  actively
    pursuing his judicial review claim and  that  this  claim  was  (as  he
    confirmed in evidence) the only reason he was seeking leave to  remain.
    They found that the appellant had failed to act on the  requirement  by
    the Upper Tribunal that he pay a fee of ï¿½700 or make an application for
    fee remission.  The fee was due to have been paid within nine days from
    the date of the decision on 20 September 2014.  They found that at  the
    date of the hearing the appellant had not made any attempt to  pay  the
    fee. The panel noted that the appellant had referred to a letter to the
    Upper Tribunal but that Mr Chohan who was  representing  the  appellant
    could not confirm the contents of the letter, not whether  it  existed,
    because it was not produced.

6.   The panel went on to record in their  determination  at  [17]  that  no
    submissions were made in respect of the appellant's claim under Article
    8 and that there was no evidence in respect of the  appellant's  family
    or private life. The panel dismissed his claim under Article 8.

7.   The grounds seeking permission to appeal  maintain  that  the  judicial
    review proceedings were pending at the time of the hearing  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and the panel were mistaken in  finding  otherwise.
    Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Garratt
    in a decision of 29 January 2015.

8.   We  heard  oral  submissions  from  the  parties.  We  brought  to  the
    attention of the parties that there had been an Upper Tribunal decision
    of 12 February 2015 that the appellant's  judicial  review  application
    had failed.  We had a copy of this  decision  and  at  [14]  the  judge
    (Upper Tribunal Judge Coker) recorded that  the  applicant  had  sought
    permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal but she was satisfied  that
    there is no arguable point of law capable of affecting the  outcome  of
    the application and refused permission. Miss Mohsin was  not  aware  of
    this final decision, although she confirmed on  instructions  that  the
    appellant was aware that the judicial review had been  decided  against
    him and told us that he intended to apply to the Court  of  Appeal  for
    permission  to  appeal.  She  also  produced  Immigration   Directorate
    Instructions (IDIs) of April 2006 (Chapter 1 Section  14)  relating  to
    leave outside the Immigration Rules and she argued  that  the  decision
    maker should have considered the IDI and that there were in  this  case
    genuinely compassionate and circumstantial reasons.  The decision maker
    had   not   considered   "circumstantial   reasons."    However,    the
    "circumstantial reasons" on which she relied amounted to  nothing  more
    than the appellant's judicial review claim. Mr Clarke for the Secretary
    of State maintained that there was no evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that there were pending judicial review proceedings  and  that
    there was no error of law, and that in any event those proceedings  are
    now concluded.

9.   On the file there is a letter of 23 September 2014 from  the  appellant
    to the Upper Tribunal asking for fee remission.  There is a  letter  on
    the file from the Upper Tribunal of 3 December 2014 that stated that  a
    fee remission had been approved. It is obvious that at the date of  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the appellant was waiting for  a
    response to the letter of 23 September 2014. However,  the  letter  was
    not produced and the appellant (who was represented) failed to  explain
    this position to the panel with any clarity.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    cannot be  criticised  for  making  findings  of  fact  which  were  in
    accordance with the evidence which before it. It was for the  appellant
    and his representative to present the appellant's case. It was open  to
    the panel on the evidence to reject the  appellant's  case  that  there
    were at the time pending proceedings.

10.  In any event, there are no longer pending judicial  review  proceedings
    because these have concluded. The appellant's argument was found in  at
    least one respect to be totally without merit; permission to appeal was
    refused by Upper Tribunal Judge Coker; and the appellant is out of time
    for any application to the Court of Appeal  for  permission  to  appeal
    against the decision. He accepts that no such application has yet  been
    made. In these circumstances any error by the First-tier Tribunal would
    be immaterial.

11.  Miss Mohsin maintained that  the  decision  should  have  been  allowed
    because it was not in accordance with  the  law  because  the  decision
    maker had not applied the above mentioned IDI's. This argument was  not
    advanced before the First-tier Tribunal. She referred us  to  paragraph
    2.2 which indicated that the respondent may  grant  leave  outside  the
    rules under a policy or in particular compelling circumstances.  It  is
    stated that grants should be rare and only for "genuinely compassionate
    and circumstantial reasons." The argument (that the decision maker made
    an error because he considered  compassionate  but  not  circumstantial
    reasons) is wholly without  merit.  There  is  no  additional  test  of
    circumstantial reasons and there were no persuasive  reasons  given  or
    legal authority brought to our attention to persuade us  that  the  IDI
    was not properly applied by the decision maker. This  is  a  discretion
    exercised outside of the rules and there is no appeal  against  such  a
    decision on the grounds that it should have been exercised differently.



12.  In our judgment there is no material error of law and the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss the appeal stands.

Notice of Decision

The appeal by the appellant against the decision of the First-Tier  Tribunal
is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
