Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No Representative


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria.  He came to the United  Kingdom
    as a student, with leave from 2010 when he arrived, which  was  due  to
    expire on 30 October 2012.  He  met  the  sponsor,  who  is  a  British
    citizen, at university.  They are committed to each other and  plan  to
    remain together.  They have a child who was born on 24  December  2012.
    On 29 October 2012, the  day  before  the  expiry  of  his  leave,  the
    appellant applied for leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  on  the
    basis of this relationship.  His application was refused  on  22  March
    2013 and the appellant was served with notice of refusal and notice  of
    the intention to give directions for his removal under s.47 of the 2006
    Act as in force at that time.    The  appellant  appealed,  Judge  A  E
    Walker allowed his appeal in the First-tier Tribunal and the  Secretary
    of State now has permission to appeal to this Tribunal.

 2. So far as the decision made under s.47 is concerned,  it  must  now  be
    accepted that although the judge made no specific reference to it,  she
    ought to have allowed the appeal against that decision  on  the  ground
    that it was not in accordance with the law.  That  necessarily  follows
    from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ahmadi [2013] EWCA Civ  512
    and that of the Upper Tribunal in Adamally and Jaferi [2012] UKUT 00414
    IAC: and that is so whatever decision is made on the appeal against the
    refusal of leave to remain.

 3. So far as the latter decision is concerned, it  is  now  common  ground
    that insofar as the appellant's compliance  with  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Statement of Changes  in  Immigration  Rules,  HC  395  as  amended  is
    concerned, the only outstanding question is whether the  appellant  was
    to be regarded as a partner within the meaning of  those  rules.    The
    judge set out the relevant rules in the sections of  Appendix  FM  with
    the heading E-LTRP, including at paragraph E-LTRP 1.10.  the  following
    requirement:

        "The applicant and their  partner  must  intend  to  live  together
        permanently in the UK and in any application for further  leave  to
        remain as a partner (except where the applicant is  in  the  United
        Kingdom as a fianc�(e)  or  proposed  civil  partner)  and  in  any
        application for indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a  partner,  the
        applicant must provide evidence that, since entry  clearance  as  a
        partner was granted under paragraph D-ECP1.1.  or  since  the  last
        grant of limited leave to remain as a partner,  the  applicant  and
        their partner have lived together  in  the  UK  or  there  is  good
        reason, consistent with a continuing  intention  to  live  together
        permanently in the UK, for any period in which they have  not  done
        so".

 4. She also set out in the definition section at paragraph  GEN  1.2.  the
    following:

        "For the purposes of this Appendix "partner" means-


     i) the applicant's spouse;
    ii) the applicant's civil partner
   iii) the applicant's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner, or
         iv) a person who has been living together with the applicant  in  a
             relationship akin to a marriage or  civil  partnership  for  at
             least two years prior to the date of  application,  unless  the
             context otherwise requires".

 5. It was acknowledged before the judge at the hearing that at the time of
    that hearing the appellant and the sponsor had not lived  together  for
    two years.  She heard evidence  from  both  of  them  and  was  clearly
    impressed by their credibility and sincerity  and  the  genuineness  of
    their relationship.  At paragraph 35  of  her  determination  she  said
    this:

        "[35] The respondent relies upon the fact that  the  appellant  and
        the sponsor have not lived together for  2  years  to  justify  the
        refusal of this application.  However,  under  section  E-LRTP  the
        relationship requirement is that the applicant  and  their  partner
        must be genuine and subsisting (1.7) and the  applicant  and  their
        partner must intend to live together permanently in the UK  (E-LRTP
        1.10).  In E-LRTP 1.10 there is reference to the applicant and  the
        partner living together for 2 years but that is only in  connection
        with any application for further leave to remain as a partner.   In
        this case this is the appellant's first application  for  leave  to
        remain as a partner.   The respondent then relies on the definition
        of partner contained in para GEN  1.2  Appendix  FM  which  defines
        partner (in the context of this case) as ((iv)) a  person  who  has
        been living together with the applicant in a relationship akin to a
        marriage or civil partnership for at least two years prior  to  the
        date of the application.  However  GEN  1.2  contains  the  proviso
        "unless the context otherwise requires".  Given that E-LRTP  limits
        the requirement  for  2  years  cohabitation  to  applications  for
        further leave as a partner to applications for further leave  as  a
        partner (and this is not such an application) I consider  that  the
        proviso "unless the context otherwise requires" applies so that  in
        order to qualify as a partner there  is  no  requirement  that  the
        appellant and the sponsor should have cohabited  for  2  years.   I
        consider that under E-LRTP 1.7 the  proper  test  is  that  of  the
        relationship between  the  applicant  and  their  partner  must  be
        genuine and subsisting and under  E-LRTP  1.10  the  applicant  and
        their partner must intend to live together permanently in the UK".

 6. She thus held that the appellant met the requirements of the  Rules  as
    the definition of partner in GEN 1.2 which would have excluded him  did
    not apply.  The Secretary of State raises three issues in  the  grounds
    of appeal.  The first is as follows:


        "The judge found at paragraph  35  (Findings)  that  the  appellant
        satisfied the criteria of paragraph GEN.1.2 ("GEN 1.2 contains  the
        proviso  "unless  the  context  otherwise  requires".").    It   is
        respectfully submitted that the proviso contained within the  Rules
        is for the purposes of the respondent to indicate  where  a  person
        does not satisfy one of the existing criteria of GEN.1.2.


        Where an appellant does come under the sections  of  GEN.1.2.,  but
        does not satisfy the criteria therein (as  is  the  case  with  the
        instant appeal  where  the  appellant  does  not  satisfy  (iv)  of
        GEN.1.2.), it is not for the Tribunal  to  apply  this  proviso  in
        their findings."

 7. Mr Richards has not addressed us individually  on  that  issue  but  we
    cannot accept the argument.  The  interpretation  of  the  Rules  is  a
    matter for the Tribunal or the courts: that is so even to the extent to
    which the Rules are to be regarded not as legislation but as statements
    of policy approved by parliament.  Compare for example Tesco  Stores  v
    Dundee City Council [2012] UKSC 13.  It was for  the  judge  to  decide
    whether the Rules as properly interpreted covered the situation of  the
    appellant.

 8. The second ground is that the judge erred in her  conclusion  that  the
    definition in GEN 1.2 did not apply.  It appears to  us  that  on  that
    ground the Secretary of State is clearly  right.   Indeed  it  is  very
    difficult  to  understand  the   judge's   reasoning.    She   referred
    specifically to the reference to two years in E-LRTP; 1.10 but there is
    no such reference in that paragraph either in any official copy that we
    have been able to see or in  the  version  that  she  set  out  in  her
    judgement.   We do not know what led her to  the  conclusion  that  she
    reached, but it appears to us to be clearly wrong.  GEN 1.2  defines  a
    partner for the purposes of an application such as  that  made  by  the
    appellant and it is clear and accepted that  the  appellant's  position
    was not that of a person who had been living with his sponsor for  more
    than two years.

 9. The third point raised by the Secretary of State is that at the time of
    the hearing before us, that is to say on 19 December 2013, other things
    being equal, the appellant now is entitled to succeed under the  Rules.
    We have not entirely understood the basis upon which the  Secretary  of
    State reaches that decision in the grounds supporting  the  application
    for permission to appeal to this Tribunal, but Mr Richards, who appears
    for the Secretary of State before us has frankly acknowledged that  the
    position at present is that because of the provisions of paragraph  GEN
    1.9 of Appendix FM the appellant is not  required  to  make  a  further
    application, but, because he has a pending appeal, is entitled to  have
    his entitlement regulated by the facts as they are today.

10. Our conclusion is therefore as  follows.   The  interpretation  of  the
    Rules is a matter for the judge but the  judge  erred  in  law  in  her
    interpretation of  the  definition  of  partner  in  GEN  1.2  and  its
    application to E-LRTP 1.10.  She should have dismissed  the  appeal  on
    the basis that the appellant and  the  sponsor  have  not  been  living
    together for two years.  We set aside her determination.

11. We substitute our decision.  There is no good reason to do  other  than
    adopt the judge's findings of fact and credibility.   For  the  reasons
    identified in the grounds and endorsed by Mr Richards, the appellant is
    now entitled to have his appeal allowed and we allow it.

12. We therefore direct that the Secretary of State grant  the  appropriate
    period of leave to the appellant as provided by the rules.
