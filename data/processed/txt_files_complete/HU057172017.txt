                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly.  This order  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.   Any
failure to comply with this order could  give  rise  to  contempt  of  court
proceedings.

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision to deport him to Nigeria, his country  of
    origin.

 2. On 12 March 2014, a reasons  for  deportation  letter  and  deportation
    order were served on  him  and  he  has  been  in  the  United  Kingdom
    unlawfully since then.

 3. Between 2014 and 2015, the claimant  exercised  his  right  to  an  in-
    country right of appeal  against  the  deportation  decision.   He  was
    appeal rights exhausted in November 2015 on that appeal.  The  claimant
    was briefly  detained  in  2016  pending  removal,  but  released  when
    judicial review proceedings were issued.

 4. Following further submissions, a second appealable decision was made on
    14 April 2017 and it is the decision by the First-tier Tribunal on that
    appeal which is the subject of these proceedings.

Background

 5. The claimant was brought to the United Kingdom by  his  step-father  in
    1987: he was 11 years old.  He has not returned to Nigeria since  then.



 6. The index offence committed by the claimant was possession with  intent
    to supply crack cocaine, heroin and possession of heroin of  which  the
    appellant was convicted at Wood Green Crown Court on 9 October 2012 and
    received three concurrent terms of 3 years' imprisonment.  The claimant
    did not appeal either convictions or sentences and still has  not  done
    so.


 7. The relationship between the claimant and the mother  of  some  of  his
    children began 2010 and there are 6 children in all, of whom one  is  a
    minor whose best interests need to be taken into account:

      1) The claimant has four children of his  own,  three  adult  children
         from his former relationship and a child born in  March  2015  with
         his current partner.  His eldest son is 24, a married  man  with  a
         family of his own.  His second son is 20 and his elder daughter  is
         18 years old.


      2) The claimant's current partner  has  two  children  from  a  former
         relationship, an adult son and a daughter who was 17 at the date of
         decision and is now also an adult: the daughter was pregnant at the
         date of the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  and  is  now  herself  a
         mother.  Her child is very young and it is not suggested  that  the
         best interests of that child are likely to be determinative of this
         appeal.


      3) The claimant also relies on the stillbirth to him and  his  present
         partner of a baby son, at  7�  months  gestation,  caused  by  pre-
         eclampsia.






The First-tier Tribunal decision



 8. On 7 September 2018, First-tier Judge Davey  allowed  the  appeal.   He
    treated the earlier decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Russell  as
    the Devaseelan starting point.  Judge Russell held  that  the  claimant
    had very little involvement with his children. At [14]  in  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  decision,  Judge  Davey  acknowledged  that  the   2015
    decision:

         "... somewhat overtaken by the independent social worker's  report,
         the events of the birth of the [daughter born in 2015], and the new
         evidence of the role the [claimant] has more recently been  playing
         in the life of the children and [his pregnant  step-daughter],  his
         involvement with her future forthcoming arrangements once the child
         is born, and steps to be taken thereafter.  It seemed to me that as
         a matter of approach the facts  have  somewhat  moved  on  and  the
         evidence has become fuller as to the parental role  the  [claimant]
         has played and the evidence that he has contact with his children."




 9. At [17] the judge correctly reminded himself that the  public  interest
    lies in the deportation of foreign criminals  as  set  out  in  Section
    117C(1) of the 2002 Act as amended.

10. The First-tier Judge accepted that it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    claimant's British citizen partner and the two affected minor  children
    to go to Nigeria with him.  The operative  portions  of  Judge  Davey's
    decision are at [22]-[24]:

         "22.     Having assessed the evidence as a whole, it seemed  to  me
             that  the  evidence  showed  that  for  the  British  national
             children and the British national partner it would  be  unduly
             harsh for them to live in Nigeria. ... Further in relation  to
             the children  and  paragraph  399(a)(i)(b),  I  found  on  the
             unchallenged evidence and ISW report that it would  be  unduly
             harsh for the child to remain in the UK without the appellant.
              Similarly the impact upon [the claimant's partner] showed  it
             was unduly harsh for her to  remain  in  the  UK  without  the
             Appellant and that it was not argued that she could or  should
             live in Nigeria, given the concession.


         23.  I reached that view that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  first,
             because of the independent social worker's assessment which  I
             found helpful as to the impact of the Appellant's  removal  on
             the family.  Secondly, the  family  is  well  settled  in  the
             United Kingdom, has no active role in  any  sense  in  conduct
             supporting or concealing the Appellant's conduct and  has  not
             acted unlawfully in any respect.  It seemed to  me  facile  to
             suggest that the family  relationships  and  dynamics  can  be
             sufficiently maintained by electronic communication  means  or
             by an occasional visit.  Quite simply it cannot be sensible to
             suggest  that  [the  claimant's  partner]  leaves  behind  the
             children or can afford to carry all the children  or  some  of
             them to visit  the  Appellant  in  Nigeria.   In  applying  my
             assessment of unduly harsh I take the view that there needs to
             be a level of seriousness and severity  of  the  harshness  in
             terms of its consequences to come  within  the  terms  of  the
             Immigration Rules.  Also it seems to  me  the  issue  of  [the
             claimant's  step-daughter's]  pregnancy,  the  fact  that  she
             remains living at home and was going to be a burden  upon  the
             family, need the help of her mother and stepfather was another
             factor which speaks to the impacts of removal of the Appellant
             on him in terms of wishing to play a part in his "grandchild".
               Given the baby is still in utero I find little weight should
             be given to that at this stage.


         24.  If I was wrong in my view that there was no need to  determine
             an Article 8 ECHR issue, I would conclude in consideration  of
             that in the context of Sections 117A, 117C  and  117D  of  the
             NIAA  2002,  as  amended,  that  the  deportation  of  foreign
             criminals is in the public interest and that the more  serious
             the offence the greater the public interest in deportation.  I
             would find that the public interest question is  to  be  fully
             considered and the public interest should be given significant
             weight.  Clearly the Appellant does not  come  within  Section
             117C exception 1 but the Appellant would come within exception
             2 on the basis of a genuine and  subsisting  relation  with  a
             qualifying partner ... or a qualifying child [the 2� year  old
             daughter], a British national and  the  impact  or  effect  of
             deportation on the partner or child would, in the light of  my
             findings, be unduly harsh.  ... there is  no  obvious  reason,
             when the Appellant previously worked, when allowed to  do  so,
             lawfully and had been employed, why he should be a  burden  on
             the taxpayer.  He plainly has integrated into society  in  the
             United Kingdom, his relationship  with  his  partner  is  long
             established and that was done at a time when he  was  lawfully
             in the United Kingdom.  Similarly his  private  life  has  not
             always  been  precarious  but  has  become  so  through  later
             events."


11. At [25] in the decision, the  First-tier  Judge  noted  that  the  Home
    Office Presenting Officer had accepted that 'it is  not  reasonable  to
    expect the qualifying child to leave the United Kingdom and accordingly
    section 117B(6) would be engaged.  In those circumstances similarly  it
    would not be proportionate or in the public  interest  to  require  his
    removal'.

12. The First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal on Article  8  ECHR  grounds
    and under the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended).

13. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

14. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  O'Brien
    as follows:

         "2.  The grounds assert that the Judge erred in the following ways.
              The Judge failed to give adequate reasons why the Appellant's
             deportation would cause  unduly  harsh  consequences  for  the
             qualifying children in particular in  light  of  the  previous
             findings in the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal.


         3.   The Judge's reasons for concluding that  it  would  be  unduly
             harsh for the children to remain in the United Kingdom without
             the Appellant are undoubtedly sparse and arguably  inadequate.
             Moreover, the Judge arguably failed to take into  account  all
             relevant circumstances when making that  assessment  including
             the seriousness of  the  Appellant's  offending.    The  Judge
             expressly considered s117B(6),  when  that  section  does  not
             apply to deportation cases.  All grounds are arguable."


Rule 24 Reply

15. Permission to seek judicial review was granted on 3 October 2018 but no
    Rule 24 Reply was filed within 1 month of that date, as  Rule  24(2)(b)
    requires.



16. The claimant's representatives sought to admit a response filed out  of
    time on 13 November 2018. We do not admit that document as  a  Rule  24
    Reply, but we have  had  regard  when  preparing  this  appeal  to  the
    indication that it gave of the arguments which Mr Jones proposed to run
    on behalf of the claimant.

Submissions

17. We heard submissions from both Counsel.  For the Secretary of State, Mr
    Wilding reminded the Tribunal that the question was whether  separating
    the claimant from his partner and their 2� year old daughter  (now  the
    only minor) would be unduly harsh.  Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act did
    not apply in the case of a deportation case and it was an error of  law
    for the Judge to have considered that subsection at all.  The  claimant
    had been born in Nigeria and lived there for the first 11 years of  his
    life and there were no insurmountable obstacles  to  his  reintegrating
    there now.



18. Exception 2 in section 117D had not been properly applied  at  [24]  in
    the First-tier Tribunal decision, having regard to the  factual  matrix
    at the date of hearing.  Mr Wilding reminded the  Upper  Tribunal  that
    the First-tier Judge did not  have  the  benefit  of  guidance  on  the
    application of the unduly harsh test given by the Supreme Court  in  KO
    (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018]  UKSC  53
    on 24 October 2018.




19. For the claimant, Mr Jones said that it was important to read the First-
    tier Tribunal decision as a whole.   The  independent  social  worker's
    report set out the variety of experiences of loss and volatility in the
    life of this family, which were drawn together for the consideration of
    family life and the effect of removing the claimant to Nigeria  on  the
    whole family.  Details from the report were considered at [6], [7]  and
    [19] in the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  and  the  Judge  had  taken
    extensive oral evidence.


20. Mr Jones relied on the contents of the report as a whole,  and  certain
    passages therein which might have informed  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    thinking but which were not set out in the decision.

Analysis

21. Judge Davey's application of section 117B(6) was a plain error of  law.
    That subsection is not applicable in deportation cases.

22. The correct section of the 2002 Act is section 117C:

         "117C    Article 8: additional considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals


         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.


         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.


         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.


         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-


             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,


             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and


             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.


         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh. ..."


    In this case, the claimant's prison sentence of 3 years means  that  it
    is not necessary to go on to  consider  subsection  117C(6)  and  'very
    compelling circumstances'.

23. The claimant does not rely on Exception 1 in subsection 117C(4).   This
    appeal was advanced under subsection 117C(5).  It  is  not  in  dispute
    that the claimant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with his 2�
    year old daughter,  or with  his  current  partner.   The  question  is
    whether his deportation would be 'unduly harsh' in relation  to  either
    the daughter or the partner.

24. In KO (Nigeria), Lord Carnwath JSC,  with  whom  Lord  Kerr  JSC,  Lord
    Wilson JSC, Lord Reed JSC and Lord Briggs JSC agreed, encapsulated  the
    correct approach to undue harshness at [23]:

         "23. On the other hand the expression "unduly harsh" seems  clearly
         intended to introduce a higher hurdle than that of "reasonableness"
         under section 117B(6), taking account of the public interest in the
         deportation of foreign criminals. Further the word "unduly" implies
         an element of comparison. It assumes that there is a "due" level of
         "harshness", that is a level which may be acceptable or justifiable
         in the relevant context. "Unduly" implies  something  going  beyond
         that level. The relevant context is that set  by  section  117C(1),
         that  is  the  public  interest  in  the  deportation  of   foreign
         criminals. One is looking for a degree of  harshness  going  beyond
         what would necessarily be involved for any  child  faced  with  the
         deportation of a parent. ... "


25. We are unable to discern from the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    why the Judge considered that the removal of this claimant would create
    a degree of harshness for his partner  and  child  'going  beyond  what
    would necessarily be involved for any child [or partner] faced with the
    deportation of a parent [or spouse]'.  Whilst it may be that  there  is
    material in the  independent  social  worker's  report  on  which  this
    decision could have been justified, it is unclear to us  what  material
    the  Judge  regarded  as  determinative  of  the  appeal.  The  Judge's
    reasoning is inadequate and the Secretary of  State's  appeal  succeeds
    for that reason, and also because the  Judge  applied  section  117B(6)
    inappropriately.

26. We note the further developments in the extended family  situation,  in
    particular that this claimant's step-daughter from his partner's  first
    relationship is now an adult and herself a mother. It is  open  to  the
    claimant, if so advised, to make further submissions on  the  basis  of
    the factual matrix as it has developed.

27. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  appeal  cannot
    stand.  Given the passage of time, it is not appropriate to remake this
    decision today in the Upper  Tribunal.   The  appeal  will  be  reheard
    afresh, and the decision remade in the  First-tier  Tribunal,  with  no
    findings of fact or credibility preserved.

DECISION

28. For the foregoing reasons, our decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    We set aside the previous decision.  The decision in this  appeal  will
    be remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.
