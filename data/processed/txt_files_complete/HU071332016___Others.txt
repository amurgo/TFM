Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr R Sharma, Counsel, instructed by Whitefields
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of  India.   The  first  appellant  is  the
mother of the second and third appellants; they were born in March 2008  and
July 2009.  The second appellant had not attained seven years' residence  by
the date of application (4 November  2015)  but  had  by  the  time  of  the
hearing before the First-tier Judge.

2.   Following an error of law hearing on 16 October 2017 I decided  to  set
aside for material error of law the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT)
Judge Frankish sent  on  31  January  2017  dismissing  the  appeal  of  the
appellants against a decision made by the respondent  on  26  February  2016
refusing them leave to remain. I concluded that the judge  failed  to  apply
the correct legal principles as set out in MA  (Pakistan)  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
705. At [116] his Lordship emphasised that it  was  important  for  decision
makers to "recognise that particular weight had to  be  given  to  the  fact
that the child had been resident for seven years". I noted that the  judge's
error as  regards  reasonableness  of  return  in  relation  to  the  second
appellant brought into play s.117B(6) in relation to  the  first  appellant.
I concluded that before the decision could be re-made  in  this  case  there
needed to be a further hearing.  I stated:
    "That is principally for two reasons.  First it does  not  seem  to  me
    that the judge's error points necessarily to  a  positive  or  negative
    outcome.  As Mr Jarvis pointed out in one of the cases dealt with in MA
    (Pakistan) the Court of Appeal did not consider it was unreasonable for
    the children in the AR and NS cases who had been in  the  UK  for  over
    seven years to be removed.  Second, the judge's finding in relation  to
    the first appellant's ties in India appears to have rested simply on an
    assumption that as she still had a  sister  there,  this  automatically
    meant she would  have  help  and  support  from  family  in  India:  at
    paragraph 24 the judge used the words "with  all  the  connections  and
    inestimable benefit of family ties  that  that  provides".   I  am  not
    prepared to decide this issue on the basis of  a  mere  assumption  and
    require the issue to be addressed by  reference  to  the  evidence  and
    submissions related thereto.  Given that it is less than a  year  since
    the hearing before the FtT, I  do  not  envisage  a  need  for  further
    evidence regarding the appellants' circumstances in the UK, but I  will
    not exclude further evidence being submitted within four weeks of  this
    decision being sent, relating to the appellants'  likely  circumstances
    in India, including as regards whether the first appellant's history of
    ill-health makes  it  reasonably  likely  she  will  be  able  to  find
    employment.  I will list the hearing for one and a half hours."

3.   At the resumed hearing, I heard submissions from  the  representatives.
Miss Fijiwala highlighted  that  in  a  2012  determination  the  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Lloyd did not find the first appellant or her husband  (Mr  P
Singh) credible including as regards the circumstances in which she came  to
the UK and in which the  couple's  relationship  had  broken  down.  It  was
unclear whether the first appellant had kept in touch with  the  parents  of
her husband who are after all  grandparents.  Even  after  the  decision  of
2012, the first appellant chose not to leave, even when she had the  support
of a husband.  As regards her husband, he no longer lives with  her  but  it
remains unclear whether their relationship had in fact broken down.  It  was
clear the first appellant's health had improved. She had  not  provided  any
further medical  evidence.  As  regards  her  family  in  India,  the  first
appellant states that her only sister remains there, but  that  is  at  odds
with what she said to Judge Lloyd in 2012, when she said she had  3  sisters
and a brother. There was a lack of evidence as  to  whether  there  was  one
remaining sister in India and as regards her siblings in Canada.  The  first
appellant had worked unlawfully in the UK and  so  would  be  able  to  work
lawfully in India. She would be able to afford accommodation  there.   There
were no significant obstacles to her reintegrating into Indian society.  She
speaks the language and has lived within the same Indian  community  in  the
UK. She has very little English and previously required an interpreter.  Her
private life in the UK has been precarious.

4.   As regards the children, Miss Fijiwala said she accepted they had  been
in the UK for  7  years  and  the  eldest  would  be  eligible  for  British
citizenship in March, but both children  were  still  relatively  young  and
adaptable and had limited ties outside their  family.  Both  speak  Punjabi.
There were schools available in India. There was no up to  date  information
about their progress in schooling in the UK.

5.   As regards public interest factors, Miss  Fijiwala  said  that  on  the
findings of Judge Lloyd the first appellant had come  to  the  UK  on  false
pretences, she had not given credible evidence about her  relationship  with
her husband, she had remained unlawfully in the UK for a  number  of  years,
she had worked illegally, she  spoke  little  or  no  English  and  was  not
financially independent. On return she would have family available  to  help
and family members in Canada would be able to help with support.  She  would
have available medical treatment in India.

6.   With reference to a handwritten  statement  from  the  first  appellant
dated 22 January 2018, Mr Sharma submitted that applying  the  approach  set
out in EV (Philippines) [2014]  EWCA  Civ  874,  the  second  appellant  was
turning 10 in two months and so was no longer a young child.  In  March,  he
would be eligible to obtain British citizenship. Both children had  been  in
the UK more than 7 years and neither had ever been to India. Whilst  it  has
been found both are likely to speak Punjabi it will  not  be  sufficient  in
their schooling. Their best interests clearly lay in remaining  in  the  UK.
Removal would disrupt their lives, notwithstanding their mother may be  able
to obtain some help in India directly or indirectly. Her brother and  sister
have now moved to Canada, so she has one remaining family  member  in  India
only.  The first appellant's work skills would not assist in  a  village  in
India. She would not be supported by family members; her sister  there  does
not work and has been ill for  12-13  years  with  a  thyroid  problem;  her
husband's army pension would not be able to cover  her  and  her  children's
needs.  By  Indian  traditions  her  in-laws  would  not  support  her.  Her
psychological  condition  has  improved  but  there  is  still  a  risk   of
aggravation. As regards the first appellant's character, it is not the  case
that she used false pretences in coming  to  the  UK.  She  did  come  as  a
fiancï¿½e; it was an arranged marriage to a different individual.   There  was
insufficient evidence of bad character. In any event,  her  children  should
not be punished for any past wrongdoings by her.

7.   On 31  January  2018,  I  issued  further  directions  stating  that  I
required the appellants' representatives to furnish  suitable  documentation
to support the claim made in para 2 of the first appellant's latest  witness
statement  regarding  family  members  living  in  Canada.   This  was  duly
provided by her solicitors on 8 February 2018.

My assessment

8.   I have taken into account all  of  the  evidence  including  the  first
appellant's latest witness statement and the record  of  the  oral  evidence
she gave before Judge Frankish. This case principally falls  to  be  decided
under paragraph  EX.1(a)  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
s.117B(6) of the NIAA 2002. It is clear  that  the  first  appellant  cannot
meet  the  requirements  of  para  276ADE(1)(vi)  as  there  are   no   very
significant obstacles to reintegrating into life  in  India  once  more.  Mr
Sharma did not seek to argue to the contrary before me.

9.   The second and third appellants have attained over 7  year's  residence
in the UK and hence I must apply to these appeals the legal  principles  set
out in MA (Pakistan). At [46] of MA (Pakistan), Elias LJ said:
    "46. Even on the approach of the Secretary of State, the  fact  that  a
         child has been here for  seven  years  must  be  given  significant
         weight when carrying out the proportionality exercise. Indeed,  the
         Secretary of State published guidance in August 2015 in the form of
         Immigration Directorate Instructions entitled 'Family  Life  (as  a
         partner or parent) and Private Life: 10 Year Routes' in which it is
         expressly stated that once the seven years'  residence  requirement
         is satisfied, there need to be 'strong reasons' for refusing  leave
         (para. 11.2.4).  These instructions were  not  in  force  when  the
         cases now subject to appeal were determined, but in  my  view  they
         merely confirm what is  implicit  in  adopting  a  policy  of  this
         nature.  After such a period of time the child will have  put  down
         roots and developed social, cultural and educational links  in  the
         UK such that it is likely to be highly disruptive if the  child  is
         required to leave the UK.  That may be less so  when  the  children
         are very young because the focus of their lives will  be  on  their
         families, but the disruption  becomes  more  serious  as  they  get
         older.  Moreover, in these  cases  there  must  be  a  very  strong
         expectation that the child's best interests will be  to  remain  in
         the UK with his parents as part of a family  unit,  and  that  must
         rank as a primary consideration in the proportionality assessment."

10.  At [116] his Lordship emphasised that it  was  important  for  decision
makers to "recognise that particular weight had to  be  given  to  the  fact
that the child had been resident for seven years".

11.  Accordingly, I give particular weight to the fact that the  second  and
third appellants have been resident for over  7  years  and  recognise  that
they are entitled to succeed in showing that it  would  be  unreasonable  to
expect them to leave the JUK unless there are  strong  reasons  for  denying
them leave.

12.  Having considered the evidence as a whole, I have concluded that  there
are strong reasons for denying the appellants leave.

13.  First of all, I turn to consider the appellants'  likely  circumstances
in India. Despite my previous directions, the evidence  as  to  the  precise
situation of her sister there remains thin, but  I  am  prepared  to  accept
that in India the first appellant has only one sister now.

I am satisfied that on return to India she would be able to  receive  family
support enabling her and her children to resume family life there. I do  not
consider that  this  would  necessarily  or  at  all  come  from  the  first
appellant's  sister,  except  in  the   form   of   short-term   help   with
accommodation and support. However, I consider  that  it  is  reasonable  to
infer from the evidence available that the first  appellant  could  look  to
her family members in Canada to assist financially. I also consider that  if
the first appellant was unable to find work in her  home  village  that  she
would be able to relocate within India to an  urban  area  where  she  could
find work and would receive support from her Canadian family members if  she
decided  to  take  such  a  step  or  if  earnings  from  her  work   proved
insufficient. She has successfully completed a Beauty Course in the UIK  and
now has experience of self-employment as a result.

14.  It is clear that the first appellant still  has  significant  cultural,
linguistic and social ties in India.

15.  The first appellant has health problems. She was diagnosed with a  mini
stroke in 2009 at eight and a half months'  pregnant  and  had  to  have  an
emergency caesarean section.  She  suffered  similar  symptoms  in  November
2015. The cardiologist at Wolverhampton Hospital in a letter dated 25  April
2016 states that she has "mild to moderate mixed mitral valve  disease  with
severe LA  dilation;  previous  cerebral  infarct;  severe  iron  deficiency
anaemia; possible migraine". It appears she is on  or  may  need  to  be  on
continuing medication.  However, the medical  evidence  -  which  the  first
appellant has not seen fit to update- does  not  indicate  that  her  health
problems are serious or are ones for which she could not  receive  treatment
in India and they have not prevented her from  carrying  out  her  parenting
responsibilities and working.

16.  The two children have never lived in India. Nevertheless,  since  their
mother does not speak English, it is clear that they have  been  brought  up
speaking Punjabi at home and could quickly adapt to Punjabi  at  school.  It
is also a reasonable  inference  that  they  have  been  brought  up  to  be
familiar with  India  culture  and  customs  and  religious  practices.  The
favourable testimonials from numerous friends indicate she  maintains  close
contact with persons of Indian origin or roots. Although  the  two  children
have done all their schooling here, neither has  started  secondary  school.
They have put down roots in the UK but the evidence does not  indicate  that
they have yet developed very significant social,  cultural  and  educational
links in the UK. The evidence is that the focus of their lives is  still  on
their own family and on other children whose mothers are  friends  with  the
first appellant. Whilst I consider that their best interests on balance  are
to remain in the UK with their mother, I note that  the  best  interests  of
the child assessment in their  case  is  one  in  which  there  are  factors
indicating that they will be able to leave the  UK  and  adapt  to  life  in
India without any significant detriment to their best interests.

17.  There are  significant  public  interest  factors  pointing  towards  a
conclusion that it would be reasonable to  expect  the  appellants  to  live
their family life in India. The first appellant came  to  the  UK  in  April
2007 on a 6 months family visit visa. Whether or not she came  as  a  fiancï¿½
for an arranged marriage that was then cancelled or not, she was given  very
limited leave and yet chose  to  overstay.  The  first  appellant  has  also
worked  here  illegally  in  a  self-employed  capacity.  That   means   her
immigration misconduct goes further than mere overstaying. It is clear  that
she entered into her relationship with Mr P Singh at a time  when  she  knew
her immigration status was precarious. She has  not  been  able  to  give  a
credible account t of the real circumstances  as  regards  her  relationship
with Mr P Singh. Indeed, it is still not clear if he is  still  in  the  UK,
whether he sees his children or has any contact with the first appellant  or
pays maintenance.  The first appellant does not speak  English.  If  she  is
able to support herself through self-employment,  her  situation  cannot  be
described as financial independence in any lawful sense.

18.  Mr Sharma has set much store by the fact that  as  of  this  month  the
oldest child becomes eligible to apply for  British  citizenship.  I  accept
that if an application is made and the child becomes British, that will  (1)
mean that the second appellant  is  unremovable;  and  (2)  necessitate  the
respondent reconsidering the first appellants' case  under  her  policy  for
parents of British citizens and  that,  assuming  the  first  appellant  can
satisfy the respondent there is no other primary carer, she is  then  likely
to succeed under the policy, as it  cannot  be  said  that  her  immigration
misconduct is at the very serious end of the spectrum, although it has  gone
further than lengthy overstaying. However, I  must  apply  the  law  to  the
facts as they are now and am not prepared to decide the case  on  the  basis
of a fact that does  not  yet  exist  and  whose  coming  into  being  is  a
contingent matter. It will be open to the  first  appellant  to  take  steps
outside the compass of these appeals which  may  result  in  her  eventually
being able to stay, but that should not determine how I decide this appeal.

19.  As regards whether there are compelling circumstances  that  warrant  a
grant of leave outside the  Rules,  the  reasons  I  have  given  above  for
concluding that it would be reasonable to  expect  the  children  to  return
with the first appellant to India also serve as reasons  for  my  conclusion
that  dismissing  her  appeal  would  not  lead   to   unjustifiably   harsh
consequences.  The  appellants  may  face  hardships  and  difficulties   in
adjusting to a very different life and society in India  and  the  schooling
and health facilities in India will be of a lesser quality than in  the  UK,
but  I  do  not  consider  that  the  family's  circumstances  as  a   whole
demonstrate compelling circumstances. Nor do I consider that either  of  the
two children have been  able  to  show  they  would  face  very  significant
obstacles to reintegration into Indian society on return.

20.  For the above reasons, I conclude:

    The decision of the FtT judge has already been set aside  for  material
    error of law;

    The decision I re-make is to dismiss the appellants' appeals.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

I have decided not to anonymise the first appellant  but  to  anonymise  the
identity of the two minor appellants. In relation to them only,  unless  and
until  a  Tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  second  and   third
appellants are granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify them.  This direction applies  both  to  the
second and third appellants and to the respondent.  Failure to  comply  with
this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
