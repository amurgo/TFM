                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Geraint James QC sitting at Hatton Cross  on
    25 September 2013) dismissing his appeal against the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to refuse to vary his leave to remain as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant, and  against  her  concomitant  decision  to
    remove him from the UK by way of directions under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity direction, and I do  not  consider  that  the
    appellant requires to be accorded anonymity for  these  proceedings  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

Relevant Background

 2. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh, whose date  of  birth  is  1
    January 1990.  On 20 September 2010 he was granted entry clearance as a
    student until 31 August 2012.   In  a  decision  made  by  Judge  Boyes
    sitting at Hatton Cross on 24 July 2013 in appeal number IA/06432/2013,
    it was held that he had made an in-time application for  further  leave
    to remain on 31 August 2012.

 3. Judge Boyes also found that the application had been  wrongly  rejected
    as invalid because  of  an  alleged  failure  to  pay  the  appropriate
    application fee.  Judge Boyes observed  that  the  facts  in  the  case
    before him were different in some respects from those in  the  case  of
    Basnet (validity of application - respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113  (IAC).
    In Basnet, the respondent specifically stated that the payment  mandate
    was invalid because there was no signature.  In the  case  before  him,
    the appellant's evidence was that his then representative had completed
    the payment mandate, but he had been unable  to  contact  his  previous
    representative to clarify what had happened with his  application.   So
    he was not able to provide any clarification by way of  oral  evidence,
    through no fault of his own, as to whether the mandate  was  signed  or
    not, nor was he able to confirm whether or not  there  were  sufficient
    funds in the account for which details were provided.  The evidence was
    thus more finely balanced in  the  case  before  him  than  in  Basnet.
    However, he did not consider that the  respondent  had  discharged  the
    evidential burden that the application was invalid.

 4. Judge Boyes held that the second application at the end of October 2012
    was made at a time when his first  application  remained  undetermined.
    He therefore had a full right of appeal and was able to  challenge  the
    decision made by the respondent against the  second  application  under
    the Immigration Rules.

 5. The judge held that the second application was made on 26 October 2012,
    although elsewhere the date is given as 29 October 2012.  Nothing turns
    on this disparity.

 6. No evidence of funds was submitted with the  second  application.   But
    bank  statements  were  subsequently  submitted  by   the   appellant's
    representatives under cover of a letter dated 27 November 2012,  before
    a decision had been made on  the  second  application.   The  appellant
    relied on a bank statement covering the period 1  October  2012  to  20
    November 2012.  Between 1 and 16  October  there  were  funds  of  only
    634.39 BDT in the account.  Judge Boyes held that  the  bank  statement
    provided did not show  that  required  funds  had  been  held  for  the
    required period of 28 days prior to the second application,  only  that
    they had been held from 18 October 2012, a period of only eight days.

 7. Judge Boyes held that the appeal could therefore not succeed under  the
    Rules.  However, the respondent had a policy, known as  the  evidential
    flexibility policy, which should have  been  considered  in  accordance
    with the guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in Rodriguez (flexibility
    policy) [2013] UKUT 0042 (IAC).  He considered that this was a case  in
    which that flexibility policy should have been followed,  but  had  not
    been.  The judge quoted the following extract  from  page  116  of  the
    modernised guidance on Tier 4, version 8.0 valid from 17 January 2013:

         Evidential Flexibility

         Under the evidential flexibility process,  where  there  are  minor
         errors or omissions in  an  application  but  there  is  sufficient
         evidence to show that the application would likely to  be  granted,
         he may contact the migrant or the sponsor for clarification  or  to
         request missing documents and/or information.

 8. Judge Boyes continued in paragraph [32]:

         It would  appear  that  when  considering  the  appellant's  second
         application form the respondent's main focus  was  on  whether  the
         bank statements  were  precluded  from  being  taken  into  account
         because of the bank's inclusion of Appendix P.   In  doing  so  she
         failed to consider if further earlier evidence of funds should have
         been sought from the appellant.  This is particularly important for
         the interests of procedural fairness in this case in  view  of  the
         previous, unlawful, rejection of the first  application.   This  is
         because the bank statements submitted with  the  first  application
         may have shown that the appellant held  sufficient  funds  at  that
         time.  It is therefore considered that the respondent's failure  to
         apply her own evidential flexibility policy in  this  case  renders
         the decision not in accordance with the law and I allow the  appeal
         on  that  limited  basis  only.   The  application  consequentially
         remains  outstanding  before  the  respondent  pending  its  lawful
         consideration.

 9. Earlier in his decision, Judge Boyes recorded  the  following  exchange
    with the appellant, who was legally represented before him:

         At the hearing I asked the appellant if any earlier bank statements
         were available,  in  particular  those  returned  with  a  previous
         application.  He did not  know  where  they  were:  the  respondent
         claims they were returned with the first application.

10. The decision of Judge Boyes was promulgated on 9 August  2013.   On  10
    January 2014 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for  refusing  the
    application  of  29  October   2012   (the   second   application)   on
    reconsideration.  The judge had ruled that his rejected application was
    valid and therefore the date of this rejected application was deemed as
    valid.  He had made this application on 2 September 2012.  The  closing
    date of bank statements submitted in support  of  his  application  was
    dated 20 November 2012.  This bank statement was dated  more  than  one
    month "prior to" his application date and as such they were  unable  to
    take this document into account when assessing funds.   The  judge  had
    considered evidential flexibility.  But after assessing  the  documents
    submitted, the Home Office would not have requested  further  documents
    under the evidential flexibility policy.  He had  not  demonstrated  he
    had the level of funds required to be granted leave to remain as a Tier
    4 (General) Student Migrant.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

11. The appellant was represented by Universal Solicitors.   In  accordance
    with the instructions given in  the  notice  of  appeal,  the  Tribunal
    served notice of the appeal hearing on the appellant's solicitors only,
    as the appellant had given  his  personal  address  as  being  care  of
    Universal Solicitors.

12. When the matter came before Judge Jones, there was no appearance by  or
    on behalf of the appellant.  In his subsequent  decision,  Judge  Jones
    noted that notice of the hearing was sent to both the appellant and  to
    his solicitors, although he noted  that  the  appellant's  address  was
    given as care of his solicitors.  He was satisfied that  proper  notice
    of the hearing had been given to the appellant and his representatives,
    and accordingly he saw no good reason to adjourn  the  hearing  of  the
    appeal.

13. The  judge  noted  that  the  appellant's  solicitors  had  provided  a
    seventeen page bundle in support of the appeal on 27 January 2014.

14. Judge Jones held that the appeal must be dismissed.  The appellant  had
    to show that he had not less than ï¿½2,100 available to him for a  period
    of not less than 28 days prior to  the  date  of  his  application  (29
    October 2012).  The appellant plainly did not discharge this burden for
    the period between 1 and 17 October 2012.  Indeed, the futility of  the
    appeal may well be the reason why the appellant had  not  attended  and
    why no contact had been made with the Tribunal on his behalf since  the
    letter of 27 January 2014 from the  appellant's  solicitors,  enclosing
    the seventeen page appeal bundle.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

15. The appellant's application for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was settled by his new representatives,  M-R  Solicitors  LLP.
    The First-tier Tribunal Judge had failed to take into consideration the
    judgment  of  Judge  Boyes  and  ought  to  have  given  some  form  of
    consideration to the bank statements provided in support of the invalid
    application of 2 September 2013.  Judge Jones had  merely  reconsidered
    the evidence relied on for the application of 29 October 2012.

The Grant of Permission

16. On 9 October 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes  granted  permission
    for the following reasons:

         The grounds are slightly confusing and the situation that developed
         shows why appellants  should  not  give  c/o  addresses  via  their
         solicitors for correspondence.   It  appears  that  the  evidential
         flexibility point was not addressed and the appellant had  made  it
         clear that he did not have the documentation.

17. Judge Parkes held it was arguable  that  the  judge  had  not  properly
    considered the matter, since the  bank  statements  submitted  with  an
    invalid application might have  supported  his  claim  about  available
    funds.  It was arguable that it was not fair that the Home  Office  had
    not provided the earlier bank statements.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

18. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Ms Asfaw sought an adjournment so that enquiries could be made  as
    to whether the respondent retained copies of the bank statements  filed
    with the first application and/or so  as  to  give  the  appellant  the
    opportunity  to  obtain  duplicate  bank  statements.  I  refused   the
    application as I was not satisfied that an adjournment for this purpose
    was in accordance with the overriding objective.

19. Ms  Asfaw  developed  the  arguments  raised  in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal.  In reply, Ms Fijiwala submitted that no error of
    law was made out.

Discussion

20. The decision of Judge Boyes was handed up to me in the  course  of  the
    hearing.  It was not included in the Home Office bundle that was before
    Judge Jones, and it was also not included in the seventeen page  bundle
    of documents served by Universal Solicitors on 27 January 2014.

21. I accept that Judge Jones did not address  the  evidential  flexibility
    issue which is touched upon in the decision under appeal.  But  in  the
    seventeen page bundle of documents served by Universal Solicitors there
    was no meaningful attempt to present a case on this topic.  They merely
    asserted as follows in paragraph 8 of the grounds of appeal:

         The Home Office decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  law.   The
         Secretary of State did not follow up the Tier 4 guidance to  decide
         the file.

22. This is simply not  good  enough.   The  judge  was  not  given  enough
    information  about  the  appellant's  case  or  sufficient  documentary
    evidence so as to be able to make a ruling in  the  appellant's  favour
    that the decision under appeal was not in accordance with the law.   On
    the limited evidence and information before the First-tier Tribunal, no
    error of law is made out on the ground of inadequacy of reasoning.   If
    Ms Asfaw had presented to Judge Jones the case which she  presented  to
    me, the situation would be different.

23. The decision of Judge clearly does not engage with what is envisaged by
    Judge Boyes, which is the Secretary of State  taking  account  of  bank
    statement evidence relating to funds held by the appellant  in  the  28
    day period prior to his first application.  But  the  judge  cannot  be
    criticised for not dealing with an issue  of  which  he  was  not  made
    aware. The burden rested with the appellant to make good his case on  a
    breach of evidential flexibility principles  in  the  disposal  of  his
    application  upon  reconsideration.  The  appellant  did  not  make   a
    meaningful attempt to discharge the burden of proof.

24. I turn to consider whether the appellant is entitled to relief  on  the
    grounds of procedural unfairness.   Prima  facie  the  answer  to  this
    question is no, as there was proper service of the  notice  of  hearing
    upon him and his nominated legal representatives.   He  was  apparently
    let down by his former legal representatives not informing him  of  the
    date of the hearing. This does  not  of  itself  make  the  proceedings
    unfair.

25. Nonetheless I ask myself  whether  the  case  which  should  have  been
    advanced in the First-tier Tribunal, but is only now advanced by way of
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, has underlying merit.  I find that it has
    some merit, but not  sufficient  merit  to  have  led  to  a  different
    outcome.

26. As I explored in  oral  argument,  the  reasoning  of  Judge  Boyes  on
    evidential flexibility was highly problematic.  What the  judge  needed
    to do was to put himself in the position of a reasonable caseworker who
    was assessing the application on the information available  to  him  or
    her.  The caseworker who assessed the second application  made  at  the
    end of October 2012 would not have been aware of the  earlier  rejected
    application, as the application and the accompanying documents were all
    returned to the appellant.

27. The bank statements provided to support the  October  2012  application
    were manifestly inadequate to discharge their required  purpose,  which
    was to provide evidence of funding for a 28 day  period  prior  to  the
    date of second application.  As the error was major, not  minor,  there
    was no duty under the evidential flexibility policy for the  caseworker
    to request alternative proof of funds from  the  appellant.  There  was
    nothing in the documentation provided, such as missing statements  from
    a sequence of bank statements, to indicate that the  error  came  about
    through accidental omission. A request for  alternative  funding  would
    have been entirely speculative, and the reasonable case worker  is  not
    required to engage in  speculation.    Thus  the  declaration  to  this
    effect in the refusal letter under appeal is entirely correct.  It  was
    not, and is not, the policy  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  request
    additional documents in the circumstances  which  appertained  in  this
    case.

28. As the Secretary of State did not appeal Judge Boyes' decision, she had
    to comply with his  ruling.   She  did  so  by  considering  evidential
    flexibility principles, and by giving the answer which she was entitled
    to give, which is that (even taking into account the  earlier,  wrongly
    rejected, application) she  would  not  have  exercised  discretion  to
    request proof of alternative funding from the appellant.

29. Nonetheless, the Secretary of State was prepared to  consider  evidence
    of funding for a 28 day period preceding the  first  application.   The
    appellant and his then legal representatives knew from the time of  the
    hearing before Judge Boyes that the respondent did not retain any  bank
    statements which might have been submitted  in  support  of  the  first
    application,  so  in  order  to   succeed   in   the   application   on
    reconsideration, a new set of bank statements needed  to  be  provided.
    It will be recalled that the appellant was  unable  to  confirm  before
    Judge Boyes that evidence of funding had in fact been provided with the
    first application, so there could not be any a priori  assumption  that
    it was provided, still less that it complied with the rules.  Following
    the ruling of Judge Boyes in his favour, the onus was on the  appellant
    to provide bank statements to show the required level of funding for 28
    days prior to his first application of 31 August 2012.  The  appellant,
    who was legally represented throughout, could not reasonably expect the
    Secretary  of  State  to  exercise  discretion  in  his  favour  in  an
    evidential vacuum.  It was for the appellant  to  provide  evidence  of
    funding for the reconsideration exercise, not  for  the  respondent  to
    request such evidence.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
