                            DECISION AND REASONS
The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Tunisia born on  22  September  1980  and
    arrived in the UK on 25 April 2010 with entry clearance as  the  spouse
    of a British citizen, that is Mrs Helen Ann Johnson  Powell-Bevan.   He
    had leave to remain until 25 June 2012 and would have been eligible for
    indefinite leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  subject  to  completing  his
    probationary period.  On  11  June  2012  however  he  applied  for  an
    extension of  stay  because  he  did  not  meet  the  English  language
    requirement essential for qualifying for indefinite  leave  to  remain.
    His application was refused on 18 December 2012 because he did not have
    the requisite A1 level English certificate.  He  appealed  against  the
    refusal.  When the hearing was next listed at Bradford Tribunal  on  27
    March 2013 he did not have possession of the A1 certificate but  stated
    that he had passed the test.  However that appeal was dismissed  on  16
    April 2013.  The appellant made a further application for an  extension
    of leave to remain which was refused on 24 October 2013.  The appellant
    did not have the requisite English language test and a  hearing  on  30
    April 2014 was adjourned.

 2. When the appeal was re-listed on 2 July 2014 before First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Kelly the appeal was dismissed in a determination dated  15  July
    2014.

 3. It was claimed that the representative had misadvised the appellant.

 4. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge had  mistakenly  confused  the  appellant  as
    being a Pakistani national when in fact he was Tunisian.   It  appeared
    that the judge proceeded on the basis that the appellant  had  "chosen"
    to apply for an extension of stay but in fact he had no option  because
    of his English language difficulties.  The  appellant  maintained  that
    they had been let down by legal advice.

 5. It was also claimed that the Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  at  the
    hearing on 30 April 2014 conceded that if he produced a B1  certificate
    which exceeded the CEFR qualification the case would be conceded.  This
    had not been taken into account.  There had been  some  confusion  over
    the certificates.

 6. The appellant had gone out of his way to fulfil the requirement, he sat
    the Life in the UK Test on three occasions and  obtained  the  A1  CEFR
    qualification.

 7. It was submitted that the judge  had  failed  to  conduct  an  adequate
    Article 8 assessment.

Conclusion

 8. It is clear from the determination of  Judge  Kelly  that  there  is  a
    reference in paragraph 1 to the appellant being a citizen of  Pakistan.
    He is not.  He is a citizen of Tunisia.  Unfortunately,  the  reference
    to  the  appellant  being  from  Pakistan  is  not  a  simple  slip  or
    typographical error because the judge proceeds  in  a  foot  note  once
    again to refer to the appellant's nationality but with reference  to  a
    previous determination where Judge Kelly states that Judge  Bagral  had
    referred to "curiously, his nationality, which Judge  Bagral  described
    as "Tunisian"."  There  is  a  further  reference  to  the  appellant's
    nationality as being Pakistan only when the  Article  8  assessment  is
    undertaken.

 9. I conclude that the judge has failed to assess the evidence  or  engage
    with the evidence carefully and that there has been an error  of  fact.
    These are errors of law.  Bearing in mind that this case hinges on  the
    Article 8 assessment I conclude that the matter should be  returned  to
    the First-tier Tribunal bearing in mind the nature and  extent  of  the
    findings to be made.

10. The decision contains an error of law and is set aside in its  entirety
    and should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  in  accordance  with
    Practice Statement 7.2.

Directions

1.   This matter is to be set  down  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  with  no
    interpreter set down for a time estimate of 1ï¿½ hours.

2.   All further evidence is to be submitted by  the  parties  at  least  14
    days prior to the forthcoming substantive hearing.
