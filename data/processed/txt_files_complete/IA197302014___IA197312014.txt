Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Poddar instructed by Hamlet Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Ms Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the respondent but
    nonetheless I shall refer to the parties as they were described  before
    the First Tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan and born on 5th April 1984  and
    6th October 1982.  The first appellant made an application on 1st April
    2014 to remain in the United Kingdom as  a  Tier  4  General  (Student)
    under paragraph 245ZX and the second appellant made an  application  as
    the husband and dependant of the first appellant under  paragraph  319C
    of the Immigration rules.

 3. The first appellant was required in part to show she was in  possession
    of ï¿½3,200 for a consecutive 28 day period, that period ending on a date
    no earlier than one month prior to the  application.    The  appellants
    accepted that they had sent a  bank  statement  to  the  respondent  in
    support of the application but this was one statement and only  covered
    the period from 17th February 2014 to 8th March 2014 and was  short  of
    the time period required.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Lucas allowed the appellant's appeal  on  6th
    January 2015 because although the appellant  had  failed  to  show  the
    requisite funds for the requisite period, the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer agreed that the matter could be returned to  the  Secretary  of
    State to exercise a discretion.  The appellant had  maintained  at  the
    appeal that she had the relevant funds in her account at all times  but
    had simply not sent in the right documents.

 5. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that  the
    judge had erred in law because he  had  no  discretion  to  remit  this
    matter back to the Secretary of State.  The  judge  had  not  indicated
    where this discretion derived.  Permission to appeal was  granted.   Mr
    Poddar argued at the hearing that  the  matter  had  been  remitted  by
    agreement.  Ms Isherwood responded that the matter did not fall  within
    the remit  of  Paragraph  245AA  and  there  was  no  discretion.   The
    respondent  also  relied   on   Durrani   (Entrepreneurs:bank   letters
    evidential flexibility) [2014] UKUT 295 (IAC).

 6. Following the error of law stage Mr  Poddar  requested  an  adjournment
    which I refused. The directions issued by the Tribunal were clear  that
    the parties should prepare for the forthcoming  hearing  on  the  basis
    that, if the Upper Tribunal decided to set aside the  determination  of
    the First tier Tribunal any further  evidence  including  supplementary
    oral evidence that the Upper  Tribunal  may  need  to  consider  if  it
    decides to remake the decision can be so considered at that hearing. Mr
    Poddar stated that he could not proceed as he  had  family  commitments
    and he wished to prepare a skeleton argument. No further  evidence  was
    prepared or served to the Upper Tribunal and bearing in mind the  delay
    and expense to the parties I found it  was  not  in  the  interests  of
    justice to adjourn the second stage of the hearing.

Conclusions

 7. The Immigration Rules specify that the appellant must demonstrate  that
    funds are available for the 28 day period prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application (Appendix C)  and  in  this  instance  the  bank  statement
    provided only ran from 17th February 2014 to 8th March 2014.  The rules
    state under 1A of Appendix C that the end date of  the  28  day  period
    will be taken as the date of the closing balance on the most recent  of
    the specified documents (bank statements).  Simply the  appellants  had
    failed to provide the relevant evidence for the requisite time period.

 8. Mr Poddar argued that the judge was simply applying paragraph 245AA.  I
    see no basis for this. There is no discretionary  element  within  that
    paragraph which could be applied in this case and there is no substance
    to the argument that the Paragraph 245AA contains a discretion in  this
    instance.  Simply one  bank  statement  was  provided  and  it  is  not
    incumbent upon the Secretary of State to request further information or
    to exercise any discretion. The rules are framed  under  245AA(a)  such
    that The Secretary of State  will only  consider  documents  that  have
    been submitted with the application, and will only  consider  documents
    submitted after the application if they  are  submitted  in  accordance
    with subparagraph (b) which reads

         '...

         (b) If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:

               i) Some of the documents in a sequence have been omitted (for
                  example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);

              ii) A document is in the  wrong  format  (for  example,  if  a
                  letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or

             iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or

              iv)  A  document  does  not  contain  all  of  the   specified
                  information;

         the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary
         of State may contact the applicant or his representative in
         writing, and request the correct documents. The requested documents
         must be received at the address specified in the request within 7
         working days of the date of the request.'

 9. Paragraph 245AA does not confirm that where the appellant has failed to
    provide the necessary documentation the respondent would write and give
    them 7 days to provide  the  required  document.  An  analysis  of  the
    documentation shows any defect did not fall within 245 AA (b)  and  the
    rules are not framed in the light of a  discretion  in  this  instance.
    The discretion for these purposes is a  matter  for  the  Secretary  of
    State and there is no obligation founded in fairness which obliges  the
    Secretary of State further to investigate with the Sponsor or to inform
    the student, Sukhjeet Kaur v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 13.

10. The appellants had failed to provide the required documentation.  There
    was no document was 'missing' from a sequence as there was no sequence;
    there was only one document.  Further, the  document  was  not  in  the
    wrong format and thus 245AA was not engaged (R (on the  application  of
    Gu) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2014]  EWHC  1634).
    One sole bank statement does not indicate that the required money would
    have been present in the account or that one bank statement should have
    obliged the Defendant's caseworker to pursue any further information.

11. The appellant may have had the funds available (which  was  unknown  to
    the Secretary of State) but  she  simply  'did  not  notice'  that  the
    statement submitted was defective. The authorities of Patel (revocation
    of sponsor licence -fairness ) India [2011] UKUT  00211  IA  and  Naved
    (Student  Fairness  notice of points)  [2012]  UKUT  14  (IAC)  can  be
    distinguished on the basis that in those cases there was no culpability
    on the part of the appellant.  I am not  persuaded  that  the  case  of
    Thakur (PBS decision - common  law  fairness)  Bangladesh  [2011]  UKUT
    00151 (IAC) assists.  The Immigration Rules in this respect  are  clear
    as to the evidence to  be  provided  and  the  appellant  had  adequate
    opportunity to provide the relevant documentation at the relevant time.



12. In this case it was the responsibility of the appellant to ensure  that
    she produced the documentation to show she had the funds in her account
    which she did not.  It is unfortunate that the appellant did not submit
    the documentation to show she had the funds but  the  judgments,  Patel
    and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 and EK (Ivory  Coast)  v  SSHD  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 1517 both confirm that the responsibility in  these  instances
    does not fall on the respondent.   These  cases  confirm  the  need  to
    submit all documentation with the application and at paragraph [29]  EK
    gives the reasoning as follows:

         "As Sullivan LJ observed in Alam, it is an inherent feature of  the
         PBS that it "puts a premium on predictability and certainty at  the
         expense of discretion" (para. [35]).   Later,  at  para.  [45],  he
         said:

             "... I endorse the view expressed by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
             Shahzad [Shahzad (s 85A: commencement) [2012]  UKUT  81  (IAC]
             (paragraph 49) that there is no unfairness in the  requirement
             in the PBS that an applicant must submit with his  application
             all of the evidence necessary to demonstrate  compliance  with
             the rule under which he seeks leave.  The  Immigration  Rules,
             the Policy Guidance and the prescribed  application  form  all
             make it clear that the prescribed documents must be  submitted
             with the application, and if they are not the application will
             be  rejected.  The   price   of   securing   consistency   and
             predictability is a lack of flexibility that may  well  result
             in "hard" decisions in individual cases, but  that  is  not  a
             justification for imposing an obligation on the  Secretary  of
             State to conduct a preliminary check of  all  applications  to
             see whether they are  accompanied  by  all  of  the  specified
             documents, to contact applicants where this is not  the  case,
             and  to  give  them  an  opportunity  to  supply  the  missing
             documents. Imposing such an obligation  would  not  only  have
             significant resource implications, it would  also  extend  the
             time taken by the decision making  process,  contrary  to  the
             policy underlying the introduction of the PBS." "

13. Mr Poddar stated that evidential flexibility was not being argued,  but
    even if it were, Durrani is proposition confirming that the  evidential
    flexibility policy did not survive the introduction of Paragraph 245AA.



14. In sum the appellant did not fulfil the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules and this was not a case were the appeal should have been remitted
    to the Secretary of State.  There can be an agreed concession  in  fact
    but not in law. The appellants did not fall into any of the  categories
    cited with Paragraph 245AA.

15. I considered the evidence including the witness statement of the  first
    appellant who entered the UK in 2009.  Her  husband  then  joined  her.
    Her witness statement  disclosed  minimal  detail  in  respect  of  the
    Article 8 issue and as she and her husband had their  appeal  dismissed
    together no doubt they will be returning to Pakistan  together.   Patel
    confirms that Article 8 is not a general dispensing power.  This is  an
    appellant who came to the UK recently to study knowing that  she  would
    have to return.  I am not persuaded that any private or family life has
    been prejudiced in a manner sufficiently serious to amount to a  breach
    of the fundamental right protected  by  Article  8,  Nasim  and  others
    (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC).

16. For the reasons given above the Judge erred materially for the  reasons
    identified.  I set aside the decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of
    the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the
    decision under section 12(2) (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007.

17. I dismiss the appeal both under the  Immigration  Rules  and  on  human
    rights grounds.

Order

The appeals are dismissed under the Immigration Rules and  on  human  rights
grounds.
