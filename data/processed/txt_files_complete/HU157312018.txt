Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Sharma, instructed by Chancery Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of  Bangladesh  born  on  4  May  1984.   He
    appeals against the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Widdup,
    promulgated on 15  March  2019,  dismissing  his  appeal,  against  the
    decision of 19 July 2018 refusing of leave to remain, on  human  rights
    grounds.

 2. The Appellant came to  the  UK  as  a  student  in  November  2009  and
    subsequently was found by the Respondent to have submitted a fraudulent
    ETS certificate. His application for leave to remain  on  human  rights
    grounds was refused on the grounds that the Appellant did  not  satisfy
    the suitability requirements and that it was a  proportionate  response
    given his dishonesty. The Appellant's appeal was  dismissed  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Widdup on the ground  that  he  was  satisfied  the
    Respondent  had  proved  the  Appellant's  dishonesty  and  the  public
    interest was not outweighed by the Appellant's private life in the  UK.



 3. Permission to appeal was sought on three grounds:

           i) There was insufficient evidence from the Respondent  to  show
              that  there  were  reasonable  grounds   for   suspicion   of
              dishonesty and the Respondent had  failed  to  discharge  the
              evidential burden  such  that  an  innocent  explanation  was
              required;

          ii) The judge  had  applied  the  wrong  test  in  assessing  the
              Appellant's innocent explanation which only  had  to  meet  a
              basic level of plausibility

         iii) The judge failed to give  any  proper  consideration  to  the
              legal burden which remained on the Respondent throughout.

4.   Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on  16  July  2019
    on the basis that grounds 1 and 3 were arguable.  He stated:

         "As the appellant's test result was only recorded  as  questionable
         rather than invalid, it is  arguable  that  the  evidence  was  not
         sufficient to discharge the evidential burden on the Respondent  to
         establish a prima facie case of  fraud  (see  SSHD  v  Shehzad  and
         Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615 at [30].

         I  see  less  merit  in  ground  2  but  would  not   exclude   its
         consideration. Permission is granted on all grounds."



The judge's findings

 5. The judge made the following relevant findings:

         "39. The Respondent's evidence includes a  witness  statement  from
             Raana Afzal  which  states  that  the  Appellant  submitted  a
             questionable TOEIC certificate in support  of  an  application
             made by him on 22 June 2012. Reference was made to Annex A  in
             that witness statement which contains the ETS Source data  and
             shows that the Appellant took the test at Colwell College Test
             centre on 16 May 2012." ...

         "40. I accept that the generic evidence provided by the  Respondent
             provides reasonable grounds for suspicion of dishonesty by the
             Appellant. I reject  the  submission  of  Mr  Aslam  that  the
             generic evidence in this case is  flawed  by  the  failure  to
             consider Blue Moon. The information provided to the Respondent
             by ETS showed that the tests undertaken by  the  Appellant  in
             2012 were questionable (see Annex A).  The  Appellant  accepts
             that Colwell College had some role in  the  process  which  he
             described as being the awarding body. It is unclear to me  why
             Colwell College would be awarding a TOEIC  certificate  unless
             they had some association with Blue Moon. In addition, I  note
             it is the test results  which  are  said  to  be  questionable
             rather than the identity or location of the test centre."

 6. The judge then made findings of fact and concluded at [43]:  "The  fact
    that the Appellant's credibility is damaged by these  elements  of  his
    case does not mean that his case in relation to the ETS  test  is  also
    lacking in credibility." The judge then set out factors which supported
    the Appellant's credibility and those which detracted  from  it  before
    concluding that the Appellant's evidence lacked general credibility and
    his evidence about the ETS tests  lacked  individual  detail  and  were
    unsupported by other evidence [46]. The judge found that the  Appellant
    had failed to provide an innocent explanation [48] and looking  at  all
    the evidence in the round the Respondent had discharged the  burden  of
    proving that the TOEIC was dishonestly procured.



Submissions

Ground 1

7.   On behalf of the Appellant, Mr Sharma relied on the grounds and  stated
    that the Appellant's own evidence was  insufficient  to  discharge  the
    evidential burden  of  giving  rise  to  a  reasonable  suspicion.  The
    Respondent's evidence was not that  the  Appellant's  English  language
    test  result  was  'invalid'  but  that  it  was  'questionable'.   The
    Respondent's evidence showed that a 'questionable' result  was  one  in
    which there had been other irregularities at the test centre such  that
    the Appellant's results could not be relied upon.

8.   Mr Sharma referred me to [28] and [29] of Rebecca  Collings'  statement
    and [46] and [47] of Peter Millington's statement and  submitted  that,
    when read together, in  a 'questionable' test result there was no match
    with a proxy test taker, but the test had been taken at a centre  where
    other tests had been invalidated. Therefore, the Appellant's  test  was
    deemed 'questionable'. He submitted that the Respondent had  failed  to
    show that a proxy  test  taker  had  been  used.  At  best  there  were
    irregularities at the test centre which could include fraudulent  tests
    for people other than the Appellant.

9.   At its highest, the Respondent's evidence was that there was  something
    'dodgy' about the college such that half the  tests  were  invalidated.
    The findings in SM and Qadir [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC)  did  not  apply  in
    this case and there was  no  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  that  the
    Appellant had cheated.  The judge had erred in his approach because the
    Appellant  did  not  have   to   provide   an   innocent   explanation.
    'Questionable' meant that there were irregularities at the test  centre
    which could mean that others had used  a  proxy  test  taker.  However,
    there was no evidence here that the Appellant was such a person.

10.  Further, the Respondent relied on  a  test  from  a  different  college
    although it was accepted there was  some  link  and  the  look-up  tool
    referred to two tests, but the Appellant stated he only took one.   The
    judge had failed to take into account the nature of the evidence  which
    failed to show that the Appellant had cheated.

11.  On behalf  of  the  Respondent,  Ms  Fijiwala  submitted  that  it  was
    apparent from the decision that the judge  was  aware  the  Appellant's
    test was not 'invalid' but 'questionable'.  The  judge  relied  on  the
    Appellant's 'questionable' ETS test, the generic and specific  evidence
    and the Appellant's interview. The judge was permitted to consider  all
    these aspects  in  finding  that  there  were  reasonable  grounds  for
    suspicion. The judge's reasons given at [40] were sufficient.

12.  Ms Fijiwala submitted the Respondent's evidence did not show a link  to
    Blue Moon, but the Appellant had accepted that there was such  a  link,
    although it was the Appellant's case that he had not taken the test  at
    Colwell College.



Ground 2

13.  Mr Sharma submitted that the Appellant's explanation had to be  capable
    of belief following Shen (Paper  appeals;  proving  dishonesty)  [2014]
    UKUT 236 (IAC). The judge  found  that  the  Appellant's  evidence  was
    unsatisfactory but that did not mean it was  incapable  of  belief.  At
    [45], the judge found that the Appellant's interview  was  not  unclear
    but then  speculated  as  to  where  the  Appellant  had  obtained  the
    information from. At [42], the judge made criticisms of the Appellant's
    evidence which was in general terms and his failure to corroborate  his
    private life and studies was not necessarily evidence of cheating in an
    ETS test. The Appellant's asylum claim was not relevant to  whether  he
    had taken the ETS test. The judge had failed to apply  the  appropriate
    test to the Appellant's proffered innocent explanation.

14.  Ms Fijiwala submitted that the Appellant had made  no  mention  of  the
    Blue Moon test centre in his witness statement and how he came to  take
    the test there. The judge accepted that  general  negative  credibility
    findings were not determinative of the ETS issue at [43] and he went on
    to consider whether the Appellant's explanation was  capable  of  being
    credible at [44].



Ground 3

15.  Mr Sharma submitted that the judge had failed to take into account  the
    weakness of the Respondent's evidence and the inconsistencies  therein.
    The fact that the Appellant had been deemed to  have  a  'questionable'
    test should not be taken against him. The appeal should be allowed such
    that the Respondent was required to put the Appellant into the position
    he would have been if the allegation had not been made following  Ahsan
    v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 2009. The ETS allegation was material,  even  if
    the Appellant could not succeed  under  276B.  The  Respondent  had  to
    provide the Appellant with a remedy.

16.  Ms Fijiwala submitted the judge considered  all  relevant  matters  and
    was entitled to find that the Appellant had not  provided  an  innocent
    explanation in his witness statement, oral evidence or  in  documentary
    form. Although the judge did not repeat all his findings in considering
    whether the Respondent has discharged the legal burden, it was clear he
    took all relevant matters into account in concluding at [49]:

         "Looking at the evidence in the round and having regard to the lack
         of an innocent explanation, I have come to the conclusion that  the
         Respondent has discharged the burden of proving  dishonesty  and  I
         find  therefore   that   the   TOEIC   certificate   was   procured
         dishonestly."

17.  In relation to Article 8, Ms Fijiwala  submitted  the  Appellant  could
    not succeed even if it was found that he had not submitted a fraudulent
    English  language  test  certificate.  His   private   life   was   not
    disproportionately interfered with. Even if the ETS issue was taken out
    of the proportionality balance the refusal of leave to remain  did  not
    breach Article 8. This  was  a  human  rights  appeal,  the  judge  had
    considered it and it was not necessary for the Respondent to look at it
    again.

18.  In response, Mr Sharma submitted that the judge  had  not  referred  to
    Ahsan which was the road map for providing a remedy in relation to  ETS
    material. There were catastrophic consequences  for  the  Appellant  in
    concluding that he had been dishonest.  If dishonesty was not made out,
    then the appeal should be reheard  because  the  consequences  for  the
    Appellant were of such gravity that a rehearing was necessary. In  this
    case there had been no proper assessment of dishonesty and the  hearing
    should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing de novo.

19.  In summary, Mr Sharma submitted the  judge  did  not  accept  that  the
    Appellant's  evidence  in  interview  was  unclear  and  therefore  the
    Respondent's suspicion was on an erroneous factual basis. The Appellant
    had given information which was  clear  and,  even  if  he  could  have
    obtained it from other sources, the fact that the  Appellant's  account
    lacked individual detail and was unsupported was insufficient  to  show
    that it was incapable of belief. It was for  the  Respondent  to  prove
    that it was more likely than not that the Appellant  had  cheated.  The
    Appellant  was  not  required  to  rebut  the  suspicion  with  perfect
    evidence. At its highest, the material relied on by the Respondent  did
    not show that the Appellant had cheated.



Conclusions and Reasons

Ground 1

20.  The generic evidence relied on by the Respondent included  the  witness
    statement of Rebecca Collings in which she stated:

         "29.  ETS  explained,  at  the  time,  that  those  categorised  as
             questionable   (as   opposed   to   cancelled/invalid)    were
             inconclusive in terms of being certain of  impersonation/proxy
             test taking. Following further  communication  with  ETS  they
             confirmed the definition of questionable and this is  set  out
             in Peter  Millington's  witness  statement;  it  is  where  an
             individual's test result was still cancelled on the  basis  of
             test administration irregularity including the fact that  that
             their test was taken at a UK  testing  centre  where  numerous
             others results  have  been  invalidated  on  the  basis  of  a
             'match'. ETS had analysed over  10,000  test  scores  at  that
             point, of which the majority were cancelled  as  invalid,  the
             remainder were cancelled as questionable."

21.  In SM and Qadir, Ms Collings, in  oral  evidence,  identified  a  third
    category of test results in which the Respondent considered the results
    to be illegitimate (not invalid or questionable) because  the  students
    had taken their tests at a test centre where large numbers  of  invalid
    and questionable results had been diagnosed.

22.  The Respondent submitted evidence specific to the  Appellant  over  and
    above the generic evidence relied on in SM  and  Qadir.  That  evidence
    showed that the  Appellant  had  submitted  an  English  language  test
    certificate from Colwell College in his application  made  on  22  June
    2012 and Colwell College was part of a criminal inquiry into the  abuse
    of TOEIC: Project Fa�ade. The Appellant accepted that  Colwell  College
    was the awarding body and providers of his English language test.

23.  The Appellant's attempt to distance himself  from  Colwell  College  by
    claiming to have taken the test at the Blue Moon test centre was  found
    to be lacking in credibility. This finding was open to the judge on the
    evidence before him. The Appellant  referred  to  the  Blue  Moon  test
    centre in his interview on 30 June  2017,  but  the  judge  found  this
    account to be lacking in detail and unsupported by any other  evidence.
    The Appellant made no reference to the Blue Moon  test  centre  in  his
    witness statement dated 14 February 2019. In oral evidence he confirmed
    that Colwell College was the provider of  the  test  and  the  awarding
    body. The location of the test centre was irrelevant.

24.  The report attached to Adam Sewell's witness  statement  dated  January
    2017 stated:

         "8.  Analysis of listening and reading  tests  results  at  Colwell
             College  shows  several  abnormal  patterns   that   are   not
             consistent with tests conducted under genuine test conditions.
             Some of these patterns are extreme and can only be  attributed
             to the deliberate manipulation of test results." ...

         "9.   These  concerns  were  not  limited  to  a  small  number  of
             individual  candidates  but  were  widespread  throughout  the
             entire  period  that  the  Colwell  College  test  centre  was
             offering TOEIC tests."

25.  In Ahsan at [31], Underhill  LJ  referred  to  recent  judicial  review
    decisions including Habib v SSHD in which the impugned test  was  taken
    at a college that was under criminal investigation, Elizabeth  College,
    and the Respondent relied on the Project Fa�ade report and Mr  Sewell's
    report. Underhill LJ stated: "It is common  ground  that  the  evidence
    raised a case to answer and UTJ Gleeson found that the applicant's oral
    evidence, which was riddled with implausibilities, was insufficient  to
    shift the burden on him."

26.  Underhill LJ went onto agree with Ms Giovannetti's submission  at  [33]
    that: "The observations of the  UT  in  SM  and  Qadir  should  not  be
    regarded as the last word. Where the impugned  test  was  taken  at  an
    established fraud factory such as Elizabeth College, and also where the
    voice file does not record the applicant's voice (or no  attempts  were
    made to obtain it), the case that he or she has cheated will be hard to
    resist." The Court accepted that was a reasonable summary of the effect
    of recent decisions, emphasising that, even in such strong  cases,  the
    issue of whether  an  applicant  or  appellant  had  cheated  was  fact
    specific.

27.  The judge took into account the generic and specific evidence  at  [36]
    and acknowledged the fact specific nature of the  appeal  at  [37].  He
    applied the correct burden and  standard  of  proof,  appreciating  the
    evidential burden was initially on the Respondent. The judge  was  well
    aware that  the  Appellant's  English  language  test  certificate  was
    'questionable' not 'invalid'. He was entitled to take into account  the
    Appellant's interview on 30 June 2017 and, whilst disagreeing with  the
    Respondent's  conclusion  about  that  interview,  he  found  that  the
    Appellant's answers were lacking in individual  detail  such  that  the
    information provided was  of  insufficient  weight  to  show  that  the
    Appellant took the test himself.

28.  A 'questionable' test result obtained from a  test  centre  where  over
    50% of the results were  rendered  invalid  coupled  with  Mr  Sewell's
    evidence and that in the  Project  Fa�ade  report  were  sufficient  to
    enable the judge to conclude, as he did, that there  was  a  reasonable
    suspicion that the Appellant had  dishonestly  submitted  a  fraudulent
    English language test certificate. I find that there was  no  error  of
    law in the judge's finding  that  the  Respondent  had  discharged  the
    initial evidential burden and it was for the Appellant  to  provide  an
    innocent explanation.



Ground 2

29.  The judge  assessed  the  Appellant's  explanation  and  gave  adequate
    reasons at [44] for why it was incapable of belief. That is separate to
    his general credibility findings which he  makes  at  [42].  I  am  not
    persuaded that the judge applied the incorrect test  to  the  proffered
    innocent explanation.



Ground 3

30.  I am also satisfied  that  the  judge  properly  considered  the  legal
    burden and appreciated it remained with the Respondent throughout.  The
    judge looked at the totality  of  the  evidence  and  was  entitled  to
    conclude, on the evidence before him, that the Appellant had  submitted
    a fraudulent English language certificate.

31.  It was accepted by Mr Sharma  that  the  Appellant's  Article  8  claim
    could not succeed if he did  not  establish  that  the  Respondent  had
    failed to show dishonesty. The weight to  be  attached  to  the  public
    interest was considerable in this case and the judge properly dismissed
    the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

32.  I find there was no error of law in  the  decision  promulgated  on  15
    March 2019 and I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.
