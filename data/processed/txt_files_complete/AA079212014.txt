For the Appellant:     Ms S Panagiotopoulon, Counsel instructed by
                    Montague Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:  Ms Alice Holmes, Specialist Appeals Team

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Bart-Stewart sitting at Taylor House  on  20
    May 2015) dismissing her appeal against the decision by  the  Secretary
    of State to refuse to recognise  her  as  a  refugee  or  as  otherwise
    requiring international protection.  The appellant's human rights  were
    not engaged, as the Secretary of State had  granted  her  discretionary
    leave to remain until 2017.  The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an
    anonymity direction, but in view  of  the  nature  of  the  appellant's
    asylum claim I  consider  it  is  appropriate  that  the  appellant  is
    accorded anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal

 2. On a renewed application for permission to appeal, Upper Tribunal Judge
    Lindsley granted permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         3.   The grounds of appeal  contend  firstly  that  the  First-tier
             Tribunal erred in law by not adjourning the appeal for a fresh
             decision to be made by the  respondent  as  her  decision  was
             clearly not in accordance with the law as it was made  on  the
             balance of probabilities rather applying the correct  standard
             of proof for asylum matters; secondly it  was  irrational  for
             the First-tier Tribunal to have found the appellant's lack  of
             knowledge of the full name of  her  trafficker  was  a  matter
             which contributed to her lacking credibility at  paragraph  27
             of the decision; thirdly the First-tier Tribunal did not  give
             consideration   to   material   matters    (the    controlling
             relationship with her father and her being brought up  with  a
             strict version of Islam) in deciding that she "had control  of
             her life"; fourthly material evidence  about  the  appellant's
             mental health was not considered when looking  at  her  mental
             state; fifthly the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  expressed
             a negative moral judgement against the appellant  when  noting
             how quickly she had found herself to be in a new relationship.

         4.   It is arguable that the credibility assessment at paragraph 27
             of the decision fails to take into account  the  reasons  that
             the appellant gave for not knowing her traffickers  full  name
             at paragraph 5 of her witness statement and is factually wrong
             in stating that the appellant has no reasons for this.  It  is
             arguable that this played a substantial role in the  dismissal
             of the appeal as it is said that this "undermines severely the
             reliability of the rest of the account."

         5.   It is arguable that no account is  taken  of  the  appellant's
             psychological state in the assessment of  the  credibility  of
             the appellant's history of exploitation and abuse, so whilst a
             summary  of  her  problems  which   include   trauma,   panic,
             depression and anxiety is set  out  at  paragraph  26  of  the
             decision these are not refer  to  in  the  assessment  of  the
             appellant's behaviour, or her  ability  to  recall  detail  at
             paragraph 33 of the decision.  It is also  arguable  that  the
             appellant's psychological state has not been considered as  an
             explanation as to why she quickly entered a  new  relationship
             and had a baby, instead of being seen as one which  makes  her
             history incredible  as  is  stated  at  paragraph  34  of  the
             decision.

         6.   All grounds may be argued.

Relevant Background

 3. The appellant is a national of  Albania,  whose  date  of  birth  is  1
    October 1980.  Her last address in Albania was an address in Fier.  She
    attended university in Elbasan to study for  a  teaching  degree.   The
    course lasted four years.  After graduating, she worked as a teacher in
    Fier from September 2003 to December 2012.   Around  January  2005  her
    father arranged for her to become engaged to a man called  Ir  who  was
    from a village on the outskirts of Fier.   Ir  worked  in  Greece,  and
    promised he would work hard and look after her.  They were engaged  for
    two years, but in the third year of  her  engagement  in  2008  it  was
    broken off.  This made life difficult for  her  in  the  village.   Her
    father blamed her for the broken engagement, and said it would make  it
    difficult for her sisters to marry.

 4. In September 2010 the appellant began a relationship with a businessman
    she knew as G.  She did not know  his  surname.   She  thought  he  was
    approximately 35 years old.  In December 2012  G  told  her  that  they
    would be going on holiday together to Italy.  She  accompanied  him  to
    Italy on 26 December 2012.  Once they arrived in Italy, G told her they
    would be going to the UK because his friends there had found her a job.
     She told him she did not want to go to the UK because she had a job in
    Albania and wanted to return home.  She believed  that  G  gave  her  a
    sleeping tablet because the next thing she remembered was being in  the
    back of a lorry.  This was on 27 December 2012.

 5. She arrived in the UK on 28 December 2012.  When she  got  out  of  the
    lorry, she was met by someone called Y and taken to a house.  The  next
    day G told her that the driver who brought her to the UK was  demanding
    �6,000 and he had borrowed the money from Y to pay the driver, but  did
    not exactly say how much.  G then told  her  that  friends  of  Y  were
    coming to the house and she would have  to  give  them  pleasure.   She
    refused.  G grabbed her by the throat, made threats  on  her  life  and
    also on the lives of members of her family.  When G left, Y  came  into
    the room and raped her.  Then two friends of Y called T and C  came  to
    the room and raped her.  She was forced to see clients.   She  normally
    saw four or five but sometimes six or  seven.   On  1  January  2013  G
    returned to the house.  When she told him to sort out her situation, he
    beat her up.

 6. The next morning she felt unwell when she woke up.  She tried the  door
    and it was open.  She saw there were men in the house,  but  they  were
    sleeping.  She saw a set of keys on the table, so she was able  to  let
    herself out and run away.  She ran and ran  and  came  to  some  shops.
    There were some ladies inside speaking Albanian and she asked  them  to
    help.  She told them that she had been forced to work as  a  prostitute
    by her boyfriend.  The women said they were family people and could not
    help her.  She sat outside the shop crying and saw a lady with a  child
    to whom she was speaking Albanian.  She approached this lady and begged
    for help and the lady took her with her.  She  stayed  with  this  lady
    from 2 January 2013 to February 2013.  Whilst living with the lady, she
    met "AL" and moved in with him in February 2013.  She had had a son  by
    AL on 7 October 2013.

 7. An NRM referral was made after she  self  identified  as  a  victim  of
    trafficking at the Asylum Screening Unit in  Croydon.   On  14  January
    2014 it was accepted by the Home Office there were  reasonable  grounds
    to suspect that she was a potential victim of trafficking.  As such,  a
    positive decision was made in her case, thus affording her  a  recovery
    and reflection period until 28th February 2014.

 8. The appellant was interviewed about her asylum claim on 26  June  2014,
    and on 24 September 2014 a  competent  authority  caseworker  issued  a
    conclusive grounds consideration minute in which she gave  her  reasons
    for not  being  persuaded  that  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that
    trafficking had taken place.  Based on the information  available,  she
    did  not  meet  the  three  constituent  elements  of  the  trafficking
    definition on account of her adverse credibility and as  such,  it  was
    not accepted conclusively that she was trafficked from Italy to the  UK
    for the purposes of sexual exploitation.

 9. She had provided no evidence to suggest  she  was  harboured  prior  to
    arriving in the UK.   She  had  provided  no  evidence  she  was  in  a
    relationship with a man whom she called G and  it  was  not  considered
    consistent she would go on holiday from Albania to  Italy  with  a  man
    whom she knew nothing about.  It was not considered consistent she  was
    transported to the UK in the way that she claimed and all of  this  was
    arranged by G within hours of her arriving in Italy to enable her to be
    taken out of the country the next day.  It was not consistent that  she
    would have discussed her family details with G when  she  knew  nothing
    about him.  It was not consistent that G would be able to threaten  her
    family if he had no details about them.  It was not consistent  that  G
    would tell her specifically the  driver  was  demanding  a  payment  of
    �6,000 for her journey to the UK, but then not tell her how much he had
    borrowed to pay off the debt.  It was also not consistent that G  would
    put himself into debt to traffic her into the UK  and  then  leave  her
    with his friends.

10. It was not consistent that if she had been in  the  circumstances  that
    she claimed she would have not sought help and  assistance  immediately
    after escaping her captors. It was not consistent she would be  in  the
    traumatic circumstances that she claimed, if she had  then  been  in  a
    relationship with a man so soon after fleeing from her captors.   There
    was no evidence that she was lured by promises of a good job, a  better
    economic situation or more money.

11. On the same day, the same caseworker issued a  lengthy  Refusal  Letter
    explaining why the appellant's asylum  claim  was  being  refused.   At
    paragraph 48, she noted that it had been determined that  she  was  not
    considered to be a victim of trafficking.  At paragraphs 49 to 52,  she
    addressed Section 8 of the 2002 Act.  The  appellant  had  delayed  her
    claim for asylum for five months.  She stated she did not claim  asylum
    earlier because she did not know the  asylum  process.   This  was  not
    consistent with the fact that her partner had already been through  the
    asylum system in the UK.  So her behaviour was  one  to  which  Section
    8(2) of the 2004 Act applied.

12. At paragraph 53 she said that consideration had been given to her claim
    at its highest.  This meant that it was not  accepted  that  she  would
    face a risk of persecution or real risk of serious harm  on  return  to
    Albania.

13. At paragraph  54  onwards,  she  addressed  the  topic  of  sufficiency
    protection.  She said that, as noted above in paragraph 48, it had  not
    been accepted that she was trafficked to the UK.  She  stated  that  if
    she returned to Albania she would have two fears:

      a)  She  feared  her  father  because  he  believed  that  her  broken
         engagement had affected her sibling chances of getting married.

      b) She feared G and Y.

14. The appellant had failed to  demonstrate  the  authorities  in  Albania
    would be unable or unwilling to offer her protection if she sought  it.
    Even if her circumstances led people to believe that she was  a  victim
    of trafficking, there was evidence available that the authorities  were
    able to offer protection  in  the  circumstances  she  described.   The
    background  country  evidence  showed  that  avenues  of  address  were
    available to her, and that she should have  utilised  them.   The  same
    background country information showed that the authorities  in  Albania
    would be able to provide  her  with  effective  protection  on  return.
    Also, internal relocation was a viable option for  her.   According  to
    her asylum interview, the only part of Albania she feared returning  to
    was Fier which was in the south west of Albania.  It was  not  accepted
    that G or Y would have either the means or the motive to trace  her  in
    Albania, and neither  would  her  parents.   She  had  not  provided  a
    reasonable explanation as to why she could not relocate to another part
    of the country, such as the capital Tirana, and start afresh.  She  had
    not demonstrated that the people she feared would either  be  aware  of
    her return or indeed have any idea about where she might  live  in  the
    future.

The Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

15. On 16 October 2014 the appellant's solicitors  wrote  to  the  Tribunal
    saying they were not ready for the appeal  for  various  reasons.   The
    respondent  did  not  accept  that  their  client  was  a   victim   of
    trafficking.  However, there was no reasoning as to how the  respondent
    had arrived at this conclusion.   The issues on appeal appeared  to  be
    internal relocation and sufficiency of protection  as  well  as  honour
    [killing] if returned and possibly being re-trafficked.  They requested
    an adjournment for the purposes of an expert report.

16. At the hearing before Judge Bart-Stewart,  both  parties  were  legally
    represented.  Mr Sandhu of Montague Solicitors appeared  on  behalf  of
    the appellant.  Mr Das Gupta, Presenting Officer, appeared on behalf of
    the respondent.  In a minute that  he  prepared  on  21  May  2015,  he
    records that a conclusive grounds consideration minute  was  served  by
    his colleague on the Tribunal and on the appellant's solicitors at  the
    December hearing, referring to the hearing which  had  taken  place  in
    December 2014.  In the same minute, Mr  Das  Gupta  says  it  is  worth
    noting that the refusal letter is contingent on the conclusive  grounds
    minute since the former fails to include any comments  on  credibility,
    only saying that the traffic claim has not been accepted.   In  future,
    he  observes,  it  might  be  wiser  to  include  a  consideration   of
    credibility in the asylum refusal letter.

17. The appellant gave evidence with the assistance of an interpreter.   As
    Mr Das Gupta records in his minute (and is also shown by examination of
    the judge's manuscript Record  of  Proceedings)  his  cross-examination
    focused on the credibility issues highlighted in the conclusive grounds
    consideration minute.  Mr Sandhu objected to some  of  Mr  Das  Gupta's
    questions.  For instance, he objected to Mr Das Gupta  putting  to  the
    appellant  that  G  was  a  fictional  character,  asserting  that  the
    Secretary of State had never suggested this in the past.   Judge  Bart-
    Stewart ruled in favour of Mr Das Gupta.  She permitted Mr Das Gupta to
    continue to put the case that the appellant had fabricated  her  claim,
    in  line  with  the  asserted  inconsistencies  relied  upon   in   the
    consideration minute.

18. In her subsequent decision, Judge Bart-Stewart set out her findings  of
    fact  from  paragraph  [23]  onwards.   For  present  purposes,  it  is
    convenient to reproduce verbatim what the judge said at paragraphs [25]
    to [35]:

         25.  Findings of fact not in dispute are that the appellant  is  34
             years old and a national  of  Albania.   She  is  educated  to
             degree level in Albania and worked a  primary  school  teacher
             for 9  years.   She  has  a  19-month  child  who  is  British
             national.  A letter dated 9 December 2014 to  the  appellant's
             solicitors  from  Maria  Munir,  Counselling  Psychologist/CBT
             Therapist refers to having regular therapy  session  with  the
             appellant in the form of cognitive behavioural  therapy.   The
             appellant presented with symptoms suggestive of  severe  level
             of depression, anxiety and  PTSD  as  a  result  of  what  she
             described as  being  subjected  to  ill  treatment  and  human
             violations in Albania.  She  also  reported  being  raped  and
             violently assaulted and forced into prostitution  in  the  UK.
             It refers to her developing a  good  therapeutic  relationship
             and attending regularly with her son.  Whilst it refers to the
             impact  of  the  appellant's  past  experience  having  had  a
             profound  impact  on  her  mental  health  and  the  appellant
             possibly needing extensive psychological support there  is  no
             diagnosis of a medical condition.

         26.  In her letter dated 13 May 2015 addressed to the appellant she
             refers to the appellant identifying  trauma  symptoms,  panic,
             depression and anxiety.  It said that it  was  agreed  it  was
             inappropriate to begin work on helping her to  process  trauma
             with her son in the room.  Questionnaires completed at the end
             of each session show these  to  remain  unchanged  within  the
             severe range.  She  said  the  appellant  indicated  that  she
             continues to experience suicidal ideation but  her  son  is  a
             protective factor.  Ms Munir was to  arrange  counselling  but
             the appellant had to arrange childcare so that she  can  focus
             during the sessions.

         27.  I accept that there may be mitigating reasons why a  potential
             victim of trafficking may be incoherent, inconsistent or delay
             giving details of material facts and may have problems  giving
             dates and concrete facts.  However unless  the  appellant  has
             reasons for not giving the full name of the  person  whom  she
             claims trafficked her to the UK, and it is  not  part  of  her
             claim that there are, I find that this part of her account  is
             not plausible and it undermines severely  the  reliability  of
             the rest of the account.

         28.  I have regard to objective evidence that human trafficking for
             sexual exploitation from in and in Albania  is  prevalent.   I
             also have cognisance of the  low  status  afforded  to  women.
             However it is implausible that  on  the  appellant's  case  of
             being a university educated woman who was 32 years old and had
             several years of teaching experience, no matter how strict her
             father, she would not know the full name of a  man  with  whom
             she claims to have been in a relationship  for  3  months  and
             then agreed to go on holiday with him.  She was  not  confined
             to the house.  She was going out to teach and she was able, on
             her account, to have a 3 month relationship with a man who  is
             well known in the area.

         29.  It is implausible that given  her  claimed  strict  upbringing
             that after going with him to Italy she would expect to be able
             to return to her family when her  claim  is  that  her  father
             treated her badly as he considered that she had brought  shame
             on the family by merely having a broken engagement.  She  then
             says that on 27th December she woke up in a lorry and  by  the
             following day was in the UK.  She latterly came  up  with  the
             surname Fier however Fier is the area where she lives.

         30.  Her claim that she was then told about a debt due to the lorry
             driver is not credible.  If G abducted her it is not  credible
             that he would have had to borrow the money  from  his  friend.
             Nor is it credible  that  the  arrangements  would  have  been
             discussed with her.  The appellant  does  not  explain  how  G
             would know her family when she knew  nothing  about  him.  The
             suggestion that it was someone being nice to her  that  caused
             her to go off with him is improbable.

         31.  Her claim that she did not know about claiming asylum  I  find
             improbable.  She says  that  she  has  not  told  her  partner
             details yet she claims to have told 2 sets of strangers on the
             street about her boyfriend forcing her to work as a prostitute
             and being raped.  The claim  is  that  a  stranger  took  her.
             There would be no plausible reason not to the police as in her
             claim challenge to G she told him that she has a job to return
             to.

         32.  Despite the account of being  drugged,  beaten  and  raped  by
             several men, and they knowing that she wanted  to  leave,  her
             claim that they left her in an unlocked room and left keys  on
             a table it seems in her room as she said she  picked  them  up
             and them went downstairs (A8), also lacks  veracity.   In  the
             screening interview she refers to several people in the  house
             at the time and having  been  given  tablets  but  managed  to
             escape without anyone noticing.

         33.  On her account, within 6 days of leaving Albania she had  gone
             to Italy, the UK and then escaped her captors.  In  those  one
             or two days would have only had clients other than Y  and  his
             friends but  in  interview  was  unsure  how  many  men.   The
             appellant was a mature educated woman.   I  do  find  credible
             that if such events had occurred in such  a  brief  period  of
             time as claimed the appellant would not have  remembered  this
             detail.

         34.  I also do not find credible that having gone through  such  an
             experience the appellant quickly formed  a  relationship  with
             and went to live with another Albanian man  so  quickly.   She
             claims to the Ms Munir that she is traumatised.  She does  not
             suggest that the women with whom she lived had put  her  under
             pressure to move on.  She immediately became pregnant.  She is
             inconsistent about whether she has told him the details of her
             ordeal suggesting in the screening interview  that  eventually
             she did but saying she did not  when  the  delay  in  claiming
             asylum is questioned.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

19. At the hearing before me, Ms Panagiotopoulon  developed  the  arguments
    raised in the grounds of appeal.  She submitted that  by  adopting  the
    reasoning in the conclusive minute, the judge  had  applied  the  wrong
    standard of  proof,  namely  the  civil  standard  of  the  balance  of
    probabilities, as opposed to  the  lower  standard  appropriate  to  an
    asylum claim.

20. Ms Holmes said she had some sympathy with the appellant with regard  to
    the respondent's reliance on the consideration minute, which was not  a
    decision on the appellant's asylum claim.  But ultimately  it  did  not
    make any difference.   The  adverse  credibility  points  made  in  the
    consideration minute equally supported a rejection of  the  appellant's
    asylum  claim,  applying  the  lower  standard  of  proof.   The  minor
    criticisms which could be made of the judge's decision did not dent the
    integrity of her adverse credibility findings.

21. In reply, Ms Panagiotopoulon said that her instructions  were  that  Mr
    Sandhu had submitted as a preliminary issue that  the  asylum  decision
    was not in accordance with the law, and therefore the matter should  be
    remitted to the Secretary of State for a fresh decision on  the  asylum
    claim.  The judge below had wrongly failed to rule on this  preliminary
    issue.

Discussion

Ground 1

22. Ms Panagiotopoulon's submission in reply is encapsulated in  ground  1.
    As I have indicated in my review of the history of the  proceedings,  I
    am not persuaded that Mr Sandhu  raised  as  a  preliminary  issue  for
    resolution by the judge the question of whether the asylum decision was
    not in accordance with the law.   However,  I  accept  that  Mr  Sandhu
    relied on the contents of the refusal letter as a basis  for  objecting
    to Mr Das Gupta challenging the credibility of the appellant's  account
    of being trafficked to the United Kingdom by  G  for  the  purposes  of
    being forced into prostitution.

23. I am not persuaded that the judge erred in law in  not  ruling  at  the
    hearing, or  in  her  subsequent  written  decision,  that  the  asylum
    decision was not in accordance with the law  on  the  ground  that  the
    rejection of the appellant's account of past  persecution  appeared  to
    have been reached through the application  of  the  civil  standard  of
    proof, rather than on the lower standard of proof appropriate to claims
    for international protection.

24. My reasoning on this matter is two-fold.  Firstly, the  appellant  (who
    at all material times had the benefit of  legal  advice  from  Montague
    Solicitors) elected to proceed to a full hearing of her appeal  against
    the refusal of asylum, notwithstanding the defect in the refusal letter
    of which her solicitors were well aware.  It would have  been  open  to
    the appellant through her solicitors to have asked for a ruling on  the
    preliminary issue at the hearing in December 2014.  Instead, they  were
    content to take delivery of the consideration  minute  which  explained
    why the appellant's account of being trafficked to the  United  Kingdom
    (and hence her account of past persecution) was  disbelieved;  and  she
    was content to proceed to a full hearing of the appeal on  the  merits,
    knowing that the Secretary of State was relying on the contents of  the
    consideration minute for the purposes of resisting the asylum appeal.

25. Secondly, although the asylum decision  letter  was  defective  in  not
    setting out the reasons for  finding  the  appellant's  account  to  be
    incredible, it was completely unrealistic of Mr Sandhu  to  expect  the
    appeal hearing to be conducted on the basis that  there  was  no  issue
    between the parties as to the veracity of the appellant's account.   It
    was clear from the asylum decision letter itself, and  it  became  even
    clearer when the consideration minute was disclosed in  December  2014,
    that the Secretary of State did not accept the appellant's account, and
    thus the burden rested with  the  appellant  to  prove  at  the  appeal
    hearing that her account of past persecution was true.

26. So I find that Judge Bart-Stewart was  right  to  dismiss  Mr  Sandhu's
    objections to the Presenting Officer's line of questioning.

27. The judge correctly directed herself as to the appropriate standard  of
    proof that she needed to apply  in  deciding  whether  the  appellant's
    account of past persecution was credible.  Just because the  caseworker
    had applied the civil standard of proof when rejecting the  appellant's
    trafficking account in the consideration minute, it did not follow that
    the judge was procedurally debarred from finding that the appellant had
    not proved her account of  past  persecution  to  the  lower  standard,
    albeit applying similar reasoning to that applied by the caseworker.

Ground 2

28. Ground 2 is that the judge placed undue weight in paragraph [27] on the
    fact that the appellant did not know G's full name.  It is argued  that
    a trafficker would not supply a trafficked person with identity details
    in case they were identified and prosecuted at  a  later  point.   This
    ignores the fact that, on the appellant's own account, she perceived  G
    as a local businessman with whom she had entered  into  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship some three months before he invited her  to  go
    on holiday with him to Italy.  It was clearly open to the judge to find
    that it was not credible  that  the  appellant,  who  was  an  educated
    professional woman, would not know her boyfriend's surname.

Ground 3

29. Ground 3 is that the judge  made  an  error  in  speculating  that  the
    appellant was an educated woman who was in control  of  her  life,  and
    ignored her  evidence  that  she  was  in  thrall  of  her  father  who
    controlled all aspects of her life, and that she had been brought up in
    a strict Islamic way.

30. The judge did not ignore this evidence.  He gave adequate  reasons  for
    holding that this evidence did not salvage the appellant's credibility.
     It was open to her to find that no matter how strict  her  father,  it
    was not credible that she would not know the full name of  a  man  with
    whom she claimed to be in a relationship  for  three  months  and  then
    agreed to go on holiday with him.  She was not confined to  the  house;
    she was going out to teach and she was  able  to  have  a  three  month
    relationship with a man who was well-known in the area.  It was open to
    the judge to find, as she does at paragraph [29],  that  there  was  an
    inconsistency between her assertion that her father treated  her  badly
    as he considered that she had brought shame on the family by  having  a
    broken engagement, and her parallel claim  that,  despite  her  claimed
    strict upbringing, she went on holiday with G  to  Italy  (despite  not
    being engaged to him) in the expectation that  she  would  be  able  to
    return to her family and her job when the holiday was over.

Ground 4

31. Ground 4 is that the judge made no  finding  on  the  medical  evidence
    concerning the  appellant's  mental  state.   I  find  that  the  judge
    adequately addressed the medical evidence at paragraphs [25] to [27] of
    her decision.  The judge acknowledged  the  opinion  of  a  counselling
    psychologist/CBT therapist, Maria Munir, who said  that  the  appellant
    presented with symptoms suggestive of a  severe  level  of  depression,
    anxiety and  PTSD.   The  judge  considered  the  medical  evidence  an
    integral part of her assessment of credibility in accordance  with  the
    principles identified in authorities such as Mibanga.

32. At paragraph [27], she acknowledged the potential  probative  value  of
    the medical evidence in providing "mitigating  reasons"  as  to  why  a
    potential victim of trafficking might be  incoherent,  inconsistent  or
    delay giving details or material facts.  It was open to  the  judge  to
    find that the symptoms reported by the appellant to  Maria  Munir,  and
    the appellant's presentation to Maria Munir, did not tip the scales  in
    the appellant's favour in the overall assessment of her credibility.

Ground 5

33. Ground 5 is that the judge's finding at the beginning of paragraph [34]
    is a value judgment, which has no place in a determination dealing with
    an asylum claim.  Ms Holmes agreed this was a finding  that  the  judge
    should probably not have made.  However, I do  not  consider  that  the
    judge was making a moral judgment, nor do I consider that  the  judge's
    line  of  reasoning  was  perverse.   I  accept  Ms   Panagiotopoulon's
    submission that rape victims react in different ways, and the fact that
    the appellant embarked on a relationship with AL within a month  or  so
    of being subjected to multiple rape does not  necessarily  entail  that
    the appellant's account is false.  Nonetheless,  it  was  open  to  the
    judge to find, having regard to the totality of the evidence, that  the
    appellant's behaviour with AL was more consistent  with  the  appellant
    having fabricated her claim, than with the claim being  true.   In  any
    event, even if this particular finding  of  the  judge  is  treated  as
    unsustainable, the remainder of her reasoning is of sufficient  cogency
    to render her conclusion on credibility a safe one.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
