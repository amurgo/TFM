Representation:

For the Appellant      Mr Hodson  (Counsel)
For the Respondent     Mr McVeetie (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. I do not make an anonymity order  under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

    2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on November  18,  2015  and
       claimed asylum. The respondent refused her application  on  February
       24, 2016 under paragraphs 336 and 339F/339M HC 395.


    3. The appellant appealed against that decision on March 1, 2016  under
       section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


    4. The appellant's appeal came before former Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Wedderspoon (hereinafter called the  "Judge")  on  November
       10, 2016 and in a  decision  promulgated  on  December  9  2016  she
       dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds.


    5. The appellant appealed that decision on December  23,  2016  and  on
       March 27, 2017 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Dineen  found  there
       was an arguable error of  law  primarily  on  the  basis  the  Judge
       concluded she was not a Kurd despite the respondent  accepting  this
       in her decision letter.


    6. The matter came before me on the above date.


    7. Mr McVeetie invited me to find an error in  law  and  to  remit  the
       matter to the First-tier Tribunal because:

        a. Some of the Judge's findings were inconsistent
        b. The Judge erred in finding the appellant was not a Kurd  despite
           her speaking Kurdish Sorani at  both  the  interview  stage  and
           hearing
        c. There was a concession by the respondent at  paragraph  [16]  of
           the refusal letter that she was a Kurd.


    8. Mr Hodson agreed that this matter should be  remitted  back  to  the
       First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing with no findings  preserved.



    9. In light of Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice  Statement  I
       direct the matter should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

   10. I direct that any additional evidence should be served on  both  the
       Tribunal and other party in accordance with the  current  Procedural
       Rules.

DECISION

   11. The appeal is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo
       hearing.

   12. A Kurdish Sorani interpreter is required.
