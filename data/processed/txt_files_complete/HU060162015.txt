Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Withwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Islam, Legal Representative


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Graham promulgated on 27 September  2016,  in  which  the  Respondent's
    appeal against the Appellant's decision to refuse her  application  for
    entry clearance dated 21 August 2015 was allowed.

 2. The Respondent is a national of Bangladesh, born on 23  July  1989  who
    applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the spouse of  her
    husband, Mohammed Kolin Uddin, the "Sponsor" under Appendix FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 3. The Appellant refused the Respondent's application on  the  basis  that
    she did not meet the maintenance requirements set out in paragraph EC-P
    1.1, specifically that she  did  not  satisfy  all  of  the  evidential
    requirements set out in Appendix FM-SE to establish  that  her  Sponsor
    earned at least �18,600 per annum.  The Respondent  submitted  payslips
    and personal bank statements for the Sponsor but the  deposits  in  the
    bank statements did not reflect the exact amount shown in the  payslips
    and no explanation had been given for the  discrepancy.   As  such,  in
    accordance with paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE, only the  net  amount
    of income deposited in the Sponsor's bank account could be  taken  into
    account as income which in this case was �16,744.

 4. Judge Graham allowed the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules,  having
    accepted the Respondent's argument that the Immigration Rules  did  not
    require a sponsor to bank the exact amount he received in cash and that
    in this case, the Sponsor  deposited  a  consistent  amount  which  was
    within a few pounds of his net income and together with  an  additional
    deposit to make up for any short payments over a six month  period  was
    in excess of his salary (the  excess  being  tips  he  received).   The
    overall difference in amounts banked was less than �17 over the period.
     Judge Graham found that the transactions in the Sponsor's bank account
    reflected his employment and salary.  In support  of  that  conclusion,
    Judge Graham also relied on the Sponsor's P60 to  the  year  end  April
    2015.

The appeal

 5. The Appellant appeals the decision of  Judge  Graham  on  two  grounds,
    first, that she erred in her  interpretation  of  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE which requires the exact amount of net
    income to be deposited in a bank  statement  in  order  for  the  gross
    income to be taken into account for  the  maintenance  requirement  and
    erred in relying on the Sponsor's P60  which  post-dated  the  decision
    under appeal.  Secondly, Judge Graham  erred  in  allowing  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules when she had no jurisdiction to do so under
    Part V of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (the  "2002
    Act") following the amendments to section 82 made  by  the  Immigration
    Act 2014.  Judge Graham made no findings on human rights.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Gillespie on all grounds.

 7. At the appeal hearing, the Home Office Presenting Officer relied on the
    grounds of appeal and further referred to the  Appellant's  Immigration
    Directorate Instructions on Family Migration as to the  application  of
    paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE.

 8. On behalf of the Respondent, her legal  representative  submitted  that
    there was no error of law on the basis  that  the  Respondent  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and therefore  the  decision  was
    not in accordance with the law and the appeal  was  correctly  allowed.
    Specifically, it was submitted that paragraph 1(n)  of  Appendix  FM-SE
    was not designed to catch  people  who  make  deposits  in  their  bank
    accounts in excess of their net  salary  (with  reliance  on  paragraph
    5.1.1 of the Appellant's IDI on Family Migration) and on the facts, the
    Judge was correct to find that the bank  statement  reflected  his  net
    earnings.

Findings and Reasons - Error of Law

 9. In paragraph 13 of her decision, Judge Graham accepted the Respondent's
    submission that the Immigration Rules do not  state  that  the  sponsor
    must bank the exact amount he  received  in  cash  and  relied  on  the
    Immigration Rules only requiring a gross income  of  at  least  �18,600
    which on the facts she was satisfied was met.   Judge  Graham  did  not
    however make any express reference to paragraph 1(n) of Appendix  FM-SE
    which provides as follows:


         "The gross amount of any cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the
         person's specified  bank  statements  show  the  net  amount  which
         relates to the gross amount shown on  their  payslips  (or  in  the
         relevant specified evidence provided in addition to  the  specified
         bank statements in relation to non-employment income).   Otherwise,
         only the net amount shown on the specified bank statements  may  be
         counted."

10. The Respondent's Immigration Directorate Instructions sets out guidance
    as to the application of the above rule in paragraph 3.1.5,  which,  so
    far as material, provides:


         "Under paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE the  gross  amount  of  any
         cash income may  be  counted  where  the  person's  specified  bank
         statements show the deposit of the full net amount which relates to
         the gross amount shown  on  their  payslips  (or  in  the  relevant
         specified evidence provided  in  addition  to  the  specified  bank
         statements in relation to non-employment income).  Otherwise,  only
         the net amount shown  on  the  specified  bank  statements  may  be
         counted.  Those wishing to  rely  on  cash  income  to  sponsor  an
         application subject to the financial requirement may need to change
         the way they manage their money and bank the  full  net  amount  so
         that they can then rely on the  gross  amount  of  that  income  in
         sponsoring the application. ..."

11. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of a material error of law in failing to apply paragraph 1(n) of
    Appendix FM-SE to the Respondent's application which, contrary to Judge
    Graham's acceptance that there was no requirement  in  the  Immigration
    Rules that the sponsor must bank the exact  amount  of  net  income  he
    received in cash, requires just that for the sponsor's gross salary  to
    be counted towards the maintenance requirement.  If  it  is  not,  then
    only the net income actually deposited in the  sponsor's  bank  account
    will be taken into consideration, which in the present case fell  below
    the required �18,600 per annum.

12. The Appellant also appeals on the basis that it was an error of law for
    Judge Graham to have relied on the Sponsor's P60 for  the  year  ending
    April 2015 as this document and the information contained therein post-
    dates the decision under appeal and therefore can  not  be  considered.
    However, I do not find  any  material  error  of  law  on  this  point.
    Section 85(4) of the 2002 Act now permits a Tribunal  to  consider  any
    matter which it thinks relevant  to  the  substance  of  the  decision,
    including a matter arising after the date of decision and in any event,
    any  error  in  this  regard  would  not  be  material   in   all   the
    circumstances.

13. As to the second ground of challenge, I find that the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal involved the making of a material error of  law  in
    that the decision was allowed on a basis that the Judge  did  not  have
    jurisdiction to even consider a ground of appeal on,  let  alone  allow
    the appeal on such a ground.  Following the amendments to Part V of the
    2002 Act made by the Immigration Act 2014, section 82(1) provides for a
    right of appeal where the Appellant has refused a protection  or  human
    rights claim, or has decided to revoke  protection  status.   The  only
    available ground of appeal against the refusal of a human rights claim,
    such as the present one, is set out in section 84(2) of the  2002  Act,
    as amended, that the decision would be unlawful under section 6 of  the
    Human Rights Act 1998.

14. For the reasons set out above, I find that the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal made material  errors  of  law  in  allowing  the  appeal
    without jurisdiction to do so and in any event in failing  to  consider
    and apply paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE to  the  Immigration  Rules.
    As such, it is necessary to set aside the decision.  In accordance with
    section 12(2)(b)(ii) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act  2007
    I go on to re-make the decision under appeal.

Findings and Reasons - re-making of the decision

15. The sole ground of appeal available  to  the  Respondent  is  that  the
    Appellant's decision refusing her entry clearance to the United Kingdom
    is unlawful under section 6 of the Human  Rights  Act  1998.   In  this
    appeal, the ground is more  specifically  that  the  refusal  of  Entry
    Clearance places the United Kingdom in breach  of  its  obligations  to
    respect family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human
    Rights.

16. When considering an individual's  right  to  respect  for  private  and
    family life in accordance with Article 8, then the  usual  step-by-step
    approach set on in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, applies as follows:


      i) Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public  authority
         with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to  respect  for  his
         private or (as the case may be) family life?
     ii) If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity  as
         potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?
    iii) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
     iv) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic  society  in
         the interests of national security, public safety or  the  economic
         well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime,
         for the protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of
         the rights and freedoms of others?
      v) If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate  public
         ends sought to be achieved?

17. In this appeal, there is no dispute that the Respondent and the Sponsor
    are in a genuine and subsisting relationship and  therefore  that  they
    have established family life.  The refusal of entry clearance maintains
    the status quo with the  Respondent  residing  in  Bangladesh  and  the
    Sponsor residing in the  United  Kingdom  (subject  to  any  choice  to
    relocate to Bangladesh to enjoy family life with the Respondent  there)
    and as such the interference to family life is by  preventing  it  from
    developing further in the  United  Kingdom.   Any  interference  is  in
    accordance with the law and would be pursuant to the legitimate aim  of
    protecting the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom  through  the
    maintenance of immigration control.

18. As confirmed by the Upper Tribunal  in  Mostafa  (Article  8  in  entry
    clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC), a person's ability to  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules is not the  question  to  be  determined  in  appeals
    brought against the refusal of entry clearance under Article 8, but  it
    is capable of being a weighty, though  not  determinative  factor  when
    deciding whether such refusal is proportionate to the legitimate aim of
    enforcing immigration control.

19. The sole ground for refusal of entry clearance  under  the  Immigration
    Rules is that the Respondent had not met the evidential requirements to
    show that the Sponsor had the required earnings of at least �18,600 per
    annum.  The relevant rule in paragraph 1(n) of Appendix  FM-SE  is  set
    out above (as supported by the Appellant's guidance also set out above)
    and requires a Sponsor to deposit in his bank account the exact  amount
    of his net income in order for  his  gross  income  to  be  taken  into
    account for th purposes of the entry clearance application.

20. There is no dispute on the facts of this case that the Sponsor did  not
    make cash deposits in his bank account which  corresponded  exactly  to
    his net pay, although it can be seen that the deposits made were within
    a few pounds (sometimes as little as  56p)  of  his  net  income.   The
    Sponsor's net pay was (with one exception) on  a  weekly  basis  either
    �308.56 or �311 and with one exception (a higher deposit of  �380  said
    to make up for the shortfall  in  other  deposits  and  including  tips
    received), he deposited between �305 and �308 per week.  The nature  of
    the deposits made, on a regular weekly basis do not  in  any  way  call
    into question the genuineness of the Sponsor's  employment  or  claimed
    earnings from it.  However, I do not find that the  evidence  submitted
    meets the strict and clear requirements of paragraph 1(n)  of  Appendix
    FM that the bank statements must show the net amount on  the  sponsor's
    payslip, as such the Respondent can not meet the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules for a grant of entry clearance to the United  Kingdom
    as a spouse.

21. In Mostafa, the Upper Tribunal, subject to  two  considerations,  could
    not see any justification for stopping a person  joining  their  spouse
    when satisfied that their circumstances satisfy the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules.  The first consideration is  whether  the  applicant
    had  contributed  to  the  application  being  refused  by   presenting
    inaccurate information or by omitting something material or  committing
    some comparable misdemeanour.  The Upper Tribunal accepted that it  may
    be proportionate to refuse someone entry  clearance  whose  application
    suffered from deficiencies such as these  because  good  administration
    requires applicants to engage with the system and there are  duties  of
    candour and co-operation.  The second consideration is  the  impact  of
    refusal on the relationships that have to be promoted.

22. In the present case, the requirements of the Immigration Rules have not
    been satisfied and the Respondent and Sponsor have contributed  to  the
    refusal of the application as although there is little  doubt  that  in
    substance  the  Sponsor  has  sufficient  gross  income  to  meet   the
    maintenance requirements, the evidential requirements to  support  that
    have not been met.  Although in a fairly minor way, this does undermine
    the system  of  immigration  control  which  has  objective  evidential
    standards to meet to support an application and there is no  reason  in
    this case  why  those  requirements  could  not  have  been  met.   The
    Appellant's guidance specifically advises sponsors that they  may  need
    to change the way they manage their  money  to  be  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE.  No reasons have been
    submitted as to why the Sponsor would not be able to do  that  for  the
    purposes of any future application.

23. In all of the circumstances and taking  into  account  the  factors  in
    section 117B of the 2002 Act as I am required to do, I do not find that
    the refusal of entry clearance is a disproportionate interference  with
    the Respondent's right to respect for family  life  for  the  following
    reasons.  As confirmed in Mostafa, weighty reasons would be needed  for
    a grant of entry clearance outside of the Immigration Rules where  they
    have not been met and in this case none have been put  forward  by  the
    Respondent.  The only submission put forward on her behalf is that  she
    meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules and  therefore  refusal
    of entry clearance would not be in accordance with the law and a breach
    of Article 8.  For the reasons set out above, the Respondent  does  not
    meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  and  no  evidence  or
    submissions have been made as to why, in the circumstances, the refusal
    of entry clearance would be disproportionate.

24. It is not in dispute that the Respondent and Sponsor are in  a  genuine
    relationship, that she speaks  English  (as  her  application  was  not
    refused on this basis)  or  that  in  fact  she  would  be  financially
    independent but this needs to be weighed against the public interest in
    the maintenance of effective immigration control.  The refusal of entry
    clearance maintains the status quo and no reasons have been put forward
    in this case as to why family life could not be enjoyed  in  Bangladesh
    or why a further application in accordance with the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules could not be made.


Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of material errors of law in that the  First-tier  Tribunal  considered  and
allowed the appeal on a ground that it  had  no  jurisdiction  to  do  under
section 82 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  and  in
failing to apply paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside  and  the  decision  is
substituted to dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
