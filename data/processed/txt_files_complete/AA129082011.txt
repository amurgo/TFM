                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     None
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a national of Iraq, appealed against a determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Whiting sent on 22 December  2011  dismissing
    his appeal.

2.   Following  a  hearing  in  October  2012,  I  issued  a  "Decision  and
    Directions" finding an error of law on the part of the First-tier Judge
    and the case was set down for hearing before me today, 9 September 2013
    for the decision to be re-made.

3.   At the hearing  Mr  Richards  produced  a  note  from  UKBA's  Assisted
    Voluntary Return (AVR) Team confirming that the appellant left  the  UK
    on 19 February 2013, having also on that date signed a form withdrawing
    his appeal.

4.   Accordingly the appellant's appeal has fallen away.  Insofar as I  have
    before me his signed wish to withdraw his appeal, I see no  reason  not
    to accept it I treat his appeal as withdrawn.

5.   In any event, by the act of leaving the UK the appellant's  appeal  has
    been  statutorily  abandoned:  see   s.104(4)   of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.






Signed                                  Date 10th September 2013


Upper Tribunal Judge Storey
