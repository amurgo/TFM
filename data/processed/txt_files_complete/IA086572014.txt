                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria whose date of birth is  recorded
    as 30th  June  1976.   On  12th  December  2013  she  made  a  combined
    application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant under the points-based system  and  for  a  biometric
    residence permit.  On 31st January 2014 a decision was made  to  refuse
    the application and to remove her from the United  Kingdom  by  way  of
    directions pursuant to  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 2. There is a history to this Appellant's status in  the  United  Kingdom.
    She was first granted leave to enter as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant  on
    19th November 2008.  I note that in December 2011 there was  a  further
    grant of leave on the same  basis.   In  the  instant  application  the
    Appellant claimed points for earnings in the sum  of  ï¿½21,007  but  the
    Secretary of State  was  not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  met  the
    requirements of  paragraph  19-SD(a)  of  Appendix  A  in  relation  to
    applications made under the points-based system.

 3. The Appellant appealed and on 11th August 2014 her appeal was heard  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Bart-Stewart sitting at Taylor  House.
    The appeal in the First-tier Tribunal focused  on  the  nature  of  the
    "employment" which the Appellant had, pursuant to a  contract  of  12th
    September 2012 with Ohi  Catfish  &  Multipurpose  Farm  ("OHI").   The
    nature of that  "employment"  was  relevant  on  the  Appellant's  case
    because if it were accepted  that  she  was  in  business  rather  than
    employed or self-employed then she met the requirements of paragraph 19-
    SD with  the  evidence  she  had  provided  with  the  application;  no
    accountant's letter being required. In the event the judge  found  that
    the Appellant was self-employed and, given the various  documents  that
    were made available and not made available, an accountant's letter  was
    required.  I set out  below,  more  particularly  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 19-SD.

 4. By Rule 19(a) it is provided that:

         "In all cases, the applicant must provide at  least  two  different
         types of the specified documents in paragraph 19-SD(a) from two  or
         more separate sources as  evidence  for  each  source  of  previous
         earnings."

    Paragraph 19-SD provides -

         (a)  the specified documents in paragraph 19(a) are:

             (i)  payslips covering the whole period claimed, which must be
                  either:

                  (1)  original formal payslips issued by the  employer  and
                      showing the employer's name, or

                  (2)   accompanied  by  a  letter  from   the   applicant's
                      employer, on the employer's headed paper  and  signed
                      by a senior official,  confirming  the  payslips  are
                      authentic;

             (ii) Personal bank statements showing the payments made to the
                  applicant;

             (iii)    A letter from the applicant's employer(s) during  the
                  period claimed (or in the case of winnings,  the  relevant
                  awarding body), on company headed paper, which:

                  (1)  is dated after the  period  for  which  earnings  are
                      being claimed, and

                  (2)   clearly  confirms  the  applicant's  gross  and  net
                      earnings during the period claimed, and the date  and
                      amount of each payment;

             (iv) Official  tax  document  produced  by  the  relevant  tax
                  authority or employer, showing earnings on which  tax  has
                  been paid or will be paid in a tax year;

             (v)  Dividend vouchers which show the amount of money paid  by
                  the company to the applicant, normally from  his  profits,
                  and which confirm both the gross and  net  dividend  paid.
                  The applicant must provide a separate dividend voucher  or
                  payment advice slip for each dividend  payment,  to  cover
                  the whole period claimed;

             (vi) If the applicant is  claiming  points  for  self-employed
                  earnings, a letter from his accountant  on  headed  paper,
                  confirming that the applicant received the exact amount he
                  is claiming, or the net profit to which  he  is  entitled.
                  This is a letter from the applicant's accountant on headed
                  paper confirming the gross and  net  pay  for  the  period
                  claimed.  The letter should give a  breakdown  of  salary,
                  dividends, profits, profits, tax credits and dates of  net
                  payments earned.  If the applicant's earnings are a  share
                  of the net profit of the company, the letter  should  also
                  explain this;

             (vii)    Invoice explanations or payment  summaries  from  the
                  applicant's accountant, which include a breakdown  of  the
                  gross salary, tax deductions and dividend payments made to
                  the applicant, and which enable the UK  Border  Agency  to
                  check that the total gross salary  and  dividend  payments
                  correspond with the  net  payments  into  the  applicant's
                  personal bank account.

             (viii)   Company or  business  accounts  that  meet  statutory
                  requirements and clearly show:

                  (1)  the net profit of the company or business  made  over
                      the earnings period to be assessed;

                  (2)  both  a  profit  and  loss  account  (or  income  and
                      expenditure  account  if  the  organisation  is   not
                      trading for profit), and

                  (3)  a balance sheet signed by a director;

             (ix) Business bank statements showing the payments made to the
                  applicant;

             (x)   If  the  applicant  provides  a  combination   of   bank
                  statements and  a  letter  of  invoice  summary  from  his
                  accountant, he must also provide  any  invoices  generated
                  during the period for which earnings are being claimed."

    The Rule then goes on to deal with specified documents in  19(b)  which
    are not relevant for the purposes of this appeal.

 5. The judge  dismissed  the  appeal.   He  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant  was  anything  other   than   self-employed   and   in   the
    circumstances of  the  case  as  advanced  before  him  found  that  an
    accountant's letter was required which  had  not  been  supplied.   Not
    content with the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, by  Notice  dated
    10th September 2014 application was made for permission  to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal. The grounds essentially rehearse the arguments that
    were advanced before the First-tier Tribunal but contend that the judge
    erred in law in finding that the Appellant was not in business and that
    an accountant's letter was required.  Permission was initially  refused
    but on the renewed application permission was granted.

 6. At no point in the application for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was the point taken that the Secretary of  State  should  have
    exercised her discretion under any  evidential  flexibility  policy  or
    Rule.  I invited Mr Fayemiwo to  point  to  any  part  of  the  grounds
    bringing the matter to the Upper Tribunal as distinct  to  any  of  the
    grounds that were before the First-tier Tribunal and he was not able to
    take me to that.  I mention this that because during the course of  the
    submissions before me there was an attempt to expand the grounds on the
    basis upon which the matter was before the Upper Tribunal.   I  refused
    permission to expand matters at this very late stage.

 7. It is argued on behalf of the Appellant that the judge erred in finding
    the Appellant to be self-employed. The significance of that, so far  as
    the Appellant is concerned, is that when one  looks  at  paragraph  19-
    SD(vi) it is only if she were claiming points for being "self-employed"
    that a letter from an accountant, on headed paper, would  be  required.
    If she were, as is contended, "in business" then the situation would be
    somewhat different and there would be the opportunity  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Rule by  the  production  of  two  other  documents
    identified elsewhere within 19-SD.

 8. The first document relied upon for the  purpose  of  demonstrating  the
    earnings pursuant to the contract of 12th  September  2012  is  a  bank
    statement from the Guarantee Trust Bank PLC but which has as its  print
    date 2nd December 2013.  Both representatives were  in  agreement  that
    that particular document met the requirements of the  Rule.  There  was
    also agreement that that documents was produced with the application.

 9. The second document relied upon by the Appellant is a letter dated  8th
    May 2013 from OHI.  It reads as follows:

         "Dear Mrs Akintoye

         Contracted dated 12 September 2012:  Re: Invoice dated 07 May 2013

         I can confirm that the sum of =  N  =  5,200,000.00  Nigeria  naira
         (Five Million Two Hundred Thousand Naira) has already been approved
         in your favour in line with our agreement dated 12 September  2012.
         Indeed we have commended making part-payments in this respect.

         We believe that our payment(s) should have started  to  reflect  in
         your bank account.

         We crave  your  indulgence  that  our  payments  will  be  made  in
         instalments though in quick succession.  This is on account of  our
         accounting system and strait cash  flow  situations  for  the  time
         being.   We  hope  that  this  will   not   affect   our   business
         relationship."

     The letter is then signed by the Managing Director.

10. There is no issue taken by the Secretary of State as to whether or  not
    this is a bona fide letter but the issue is whether or not it satisfies
    the requirements of the Rules.  For the Appellant, Mr  Fayemiwo  relies
    on paragraph  19-SD(iii).   That  subparagraph  clearly  relates  to  a
    situation where an applicant is in employment.  It says so.   It  could
    not be clearer in its terms.  It says, "a letter from  the  applicant's
    employers".  Clearly the  Rules  contemplate  situations  in  which  an
    individual would be self-employed.  Paragraph (vi) makes plain that  if
    the applicant is claiming points  for  self-employed  earnings  then  a
    letter from the accountant is required but that is not the  Appellant's
    case.  She contends that she is not, and was not, for  the  purpose  of
    this contract self-employed so that  an  accountant's  letter  was  not
    required and indeed no accountant's letter was produced.

11. Could a person in business meet the requirements  of  the  Rules?   The
    answer to  that  is,  "Yes"  and  the  Rules  in  my  judgment  clearly
    contemplate the situation where if  a  person  is  in  trade  they  can
    provide documentation that would  meet  the  requirements  such  as  an
    official tax document - see (iv), or (v) dividend  vouchers  or  indeed
    invoices (vii) or company or business accounts (viii).

12. It is clear to me that the mischief under the Rules is to  ensure  that
    the Secretary of State is in a position to know what the gross and  net
    amounts of money available to the  applicant  are,  so  that  a  proper
    assessment can be made under the Rules.  The letter  is  deficient  not
    only because it is not, and has never been the  Appellant's  case  that
    for the purposes of this particular contract she is employed, but it is
    also deficient because it refers a sum which is  clearly  gross.   When
    read together with the contract, still the net amount is not given.

13. On behalf of the Appellant application was made to adduce, pursuant  to
    Rule 15 of the Upper Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2008 a letter  from  an
    accountant dated 11th November 2013.  Quite why  that  letter  was  not
    sent with the application when the application  itself  is  dated  12th
    December 2013 when that the letter clearly was in  existence  prior  to
    the application being made, is not clear.  Nevertheless, the letter  is
    inadmissible.  The letter should have been sent with  the  application.
    It was not.  It is excluded by virtue of Section 85A of the Nationality
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, notwithstanding  any  directions  made
    for the purposes of this appeal.

14. On behalf of the Appellant Mr Fayemiwo pointed to the directions  made,
    in particular the directions to the effect that:

         "The Appellant must file at the Upper Tribunal and serve  upon  the
         Respondent no  later  than  five  working  days  before  the  Upper
         Tribunal  initial  hearing  a  bundle  of  all  relevant  documents
         including a detailed skeleton argument and copies of  the  relevant
         Immigration Rules and Home Office guidance/instructions in force at
         the material time".

15. The evidence can only be relevant if  it  is  admissible.   It  is  not
    admissible.  By that I refer to the accountant's letter which,  in  any
    event, were I to admit it, points to the very deficiency identified  by
    the Secretary of State since the letter deals with both gross  and  net
    sums.

16. In all the circumstances I find that the issue as to whether or not the
    Appellant was self-employed or in trade is immaterial  because  whether
    or not the Appellant was self-employed or in trade, she did not produce
    the documentation required under the Rules.  The points-based system is
    designed in order to be efficient with caseworkers being able  to  deal
    with cases, speedily and fairly. It is  incumbent  upon  applicants  to
    place before the Secretary of  State  the  relevant  documents  at  the
    relevant time.

17. Mr Fayemiwo sought to persuade me that there had been unfairness on the
    part of the Secretary of State, which unfairness  the  judge  ought  to
    have identified because there had been  a  previous  application,  with
    identical documentation submitted to the Secretary of  State  resulting
    in a variation of leave.  I have seen a copy of the earlier application
    but I was not satisfied from the bundle of documents produced  that  in
    fact the documentation was identical in terms.  In any event the  point
    was not a point that was taken  in  the  grounds  bringing  the  matter
    before the Upper Tribunal and therefore it is not  a  matter  which  is
    before me.

18. In all the circumstances the appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed. The decision  of  the  First-
tier Tribunal is affirmed.
