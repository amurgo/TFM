                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against a decision taken on 3  July
    2014 refusing her application for further leave to remain in the United
    Kingdom on the basis of her marriage.

Background Facts

 2. The appellant is a citizen of India born on 1 July 1981.  She  came  to
    the United Kingdom on 28 February 2012 on a spouse visa  which  granted
    her leave to remain in the UK until 30 April 2014.  On  23  April  2014
    she applied for further leave to remain on the basis of her marriage to
    Mr Lakhman Odedra, an Indian national, who is settled in the  UK.   The
    respondent  considered  the  application  under  Appendix  FM  of   the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended).  The respondent considered  that
    the appellant did not meet the financial requirements  or  the  English
    language  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The   respondent
    considered that there were no insurmountable obstacles  preventing  the
    appellant from continuing her relationship with her husband  in  India.
    The  respondent  also  considered  the  appellant's  application  under
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  The  respondent  considered
    that the appellant had not lost all ties to India and therefore was not
    satisfied that she met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.   The
    Secretary of State  also  considered  that  there  were  no  particular
    circumstances that warranted a grant of leave  to  remain  outside  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  a  decision
    promulgated on 24 March 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly  dismissed
    the  appellant's  appeal.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  the
    appellant did not meet the financial requirements in E-LTRP.3.1 because
    the appellant had failed to provide all of the very  specific  evidence
    that is required under Appendix FM-SE to  establish  that  she  and  Mr
    Odedra met the �18,600 income threshold.  The judge also found that the
    appellant had failed to satisfy the English language requirement in  E-
    LTRP.4.1.   The  judge  considered  whether  the  appellant   met   the
    requirements of paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix  FM  finding  that  there
    were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  Mr  Odedra
    continuing outside the  United  Kingdom.   The  judge  also  considered
    whether there were any features of the appellant's case not covered  by
    the Rules upon which her appeal might succeed under Article  8  outside
    the Rules but found that there were none.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 4. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  On  9
    June 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge  De  Haney  granted  permission  to
    appeal.  The grounds set out that there seemed to be  no  consideration
    of SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and it  is  arguable  that
    the Article 8 assessment lacks detail.  Thus the appeal came before me.



The Hearing Before the Upper Tribunal

 5. At the commencement of the hearing Mr  Sharma  handed  up  a  document,
    which was a pass notification letter for a Life in the UK test  with  a
    test date of 17 June 2015.  This document was not before the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge.  It could therefore only be relevant if I were to  find
    that there was a material error of law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision.  Mr Sharma submitted that the ESOL  certificate  provided  at
    the time of the hearing was valid.  He referred to a new certificate in
    the bundle submitted for the purposes of the hearing before  the  Upper
    Tribunal at page 106 to 109 of the bundle.  I indicated  to  Mr  Sharma
    that I could not see anything  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  where  the
    appellant had sought permission to appeal against the judge's  findings
    on the English language requirement.  Mr Sharma referred me  to  ground
    1(b) of the grounds of appeal, however I pointed out to Mr Sharma  that
    that did not refer to the English language requirement and  was  headed
    Appendix FM Section 1.7 Financial Requirement.  I asked  Mr  Sharma  if
    the bundle prepared for the hearing before the Upper Tribunal contained
    only documents that were before the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Mr  Sharma
    indicated that the documents were documents that were before the First-
    tier Tribunal.  However, the documents that he referred me to at  pages
    106 to 109 are dated 29 June 2015 and therefore  postdate  the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal, which was held on  13  March  2015.   I
    note that there are a number of other documents in the bundle that were
    not before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  No application was  made  by
    Mr Sharma to  admit  new  evidence  before  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The
    appellant was given  directions  reminding  of  the  need  to  make  an
    application pursuant to Rule 15(2A) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008.  I indicated to Mr Sharma that, as  this  was  an
    error of law hearing, documents that were  not  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge cannot be relied on to demonstrate  that  there  was  an
    error of law.  There was no application to amend the grounds of  appeal
    against the judge's  finding  that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
    language requirements, rather Mr Sharma suggested that  nevertheless  I
    could take the new evidence into account.

 6. There is no appeal against the judge's  findings  in  relation  to  the
    English language requirements and for the avoidance  of  doubt  (if  Mr
    Sharma's submissions are to  be  treated  as  an  application  for  the
    grounds to be amended) I have not allowed the grounds to be amended  so
    as to grant permission to appeal against those findings.

Summary of Submissions

The appellant's submissions

 7. The grounds of appeal (which are lengthy) assert that the determination
    is so unreasonable that no reasonable Tribunal could ever have come  to
    it.  It is asserted that the Tribunal Judge erred  by  misapplying  the
    law.  The Tribunal used an incorrect interpretation  of  the  Rules  at
    Appendix FM-SE paragraph  5(b)(ii).   It  is  also  asserted  that  the
    Tribunal considered incorrectly that it was required to  look  only  at
    the period up to the date of application.   It  is  asserted  that  the
    appellant, at the date of the hearing,  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules at Appendix FM-SE.  It is asserted in the alternative
    that the appellant meets the requirements of EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  as
    there are insurmountable obstacles to the  appellant  and  her  husband
    continuing their family life outside the UK.  It  is  further  asserted
    that  the  Tribunal  materially  erred  by  putting  undue  weight   on
    irrelevant  matters  and  failing  to  take   relevant   matters   into
    consideration.  It is asserted that it is unreasonable and unlawful  to
    require a person legitimately settled and domiciled in the UK to  leave
    this country in order to maintain  her  family  life,  because  of  her
    ethnicity.  The grounds set out that the Tribunal erred by  failing  to
    determine the appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  by  rigorously  going
    through the systematic balancing exercise as laid down  in  Razgar  (on
    the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004]
    UKHL 27.  It is  asserted  that  the  Tribunal  acted  unreasonably  by
    failing to place  due  weight  on  the  grievous  consequences  of  the
    decision for the  appellant's  and  her  family's  life.   It  is  also
    asserted that the Tribunal failed to determine whether the respondent's
    failure  to  allow  the  appellant  more  time  to  pass  the  language
    requirement by granting her leave outside the Rules was  in  accordance
    with the law.

 8. Mr Sharma's submissions were lengthy and at times did not relate to the
    purpose of the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, which was to consider
    whether or not there was an error of law in the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision.  I have summarised Mr Sharma's submissions  insofar  as  they
    were relevant to the matter before the Upper Tribunal.

 9. Mr Sharma submitted that the appellant was granted entry  clearance  on
    the grounds that her marriage was genuine and  subsisting  and  on  the
    understanding that the sponsor  was  working  and  could  maintain  and
    accommodate his wife without recourse to public  funds.   He  submitted
    that there is no reason to believe that in the foreseeable  future  the
    appellant will become a burden on the state.  He referred to  a  bundle
    of documents submitted for the Upper Tribunal hearing, submitting  that
    he had provided the contract of employment issued by Tesco at  page  10
    of the bundle.  I indicated to Mr Sharma that  this  document  was  not
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  Mr Sharma referred me to pages  11  to
    45 of the bundle submitting that those documents were before the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.  However, I indicated to Mr Sharma that several of
    these documents could not have  been  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    because they post-dated the date of the hearing.  Whilst  they  may  be
    material if I found an error of law I indicated that Mr  Sharma  needed
    to address me on the error f law point first. Mr Sharma submitted  that
    I could take into account evidence up to the date of  today's  hearing.
    I reminded Mr Sharma that the matter before me was whether or  not  the
    First-tier Tribunal had made a material error of law.  I  indicated  to
    Mr Sharma that  with  regard  to  the  judge's  findings  on  financial
    requirements he needed to address me on paragraph 18 of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's decision where the judge had found that the  appellant
    had not provided the specified evidence required in Appendix  FM-SE  of
    either her or her sponsor's income.  Mr Sharma referred me to  page  11
    of the Upper Tribunal  bundle  and  the  P60  that  was  provided.   He
    submitted that the judge was wrong to find that specified evidence  was
    not provided.  Mr Sharma agreed that  the  relevant  period  for  which
    evidence was required was September 2013 to April 2014,  the  six-month
    period prior to the application.  I referred Mr Sharma to  paragraph  9
    of the First-tier Tribunal  decision  where  the  judge  sets  out  the
    evidence that was before him.  Mr Sharma submitted that documents  were
    sent in to the Home Office in relation to an  application  made  on  23
    April 2014 but that the Home Office had requested that  an  application
    was made on a different form.  He referred to a letter accompanying the
    application and a box ticked on the application, which  indicated  that
    financial evidence had been submitted to the Home Office.  He indicated
    that it was clear that the  sponsor  and  the  appellant  between  them
    earned in excess of the  �18,600  threshold  and  that  they  have  now
    provided pay slips.  I asked Mr Sharma to take me to the documents that
    were before the First-tier Tribunal.  Mr Sharma referred me to a number
    of documents, however not all of those documents were before the First-
    tier Tribunal.  In response to my questions about which documents  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal, Mr Sharma submitted  that  it  was  the
    duty of the First-tier Tribunal judge to ask the Home  Office  for  the
    documents and that the appellant should not be penalised because of  an
    innocent mistake.  He submitted that the documents had been sent in  to
    the Home Office (although he could not identify what had actually  been
    sent).  He submitted that the totality of the evidence of the appellant
    and the sponsor is that they were very much independent financially  at
    the date of the refusal, the date of the appeal and as at today's date.
     With regard to the English language requirement, Mr  Sharma  submitted
    that he has now provided a certificate that the  appellant  has  passed
    the Life in the UK test.  He submitted that I was entitled to take  all
    the evidence into account and come to a different conclusion in  favour
    of the appellant.  With regard to the judge's findings on the right  to
    respect for private and family life, Mr Sharma submitted  that  it  was
    not clear what the interest was behind removing the appellant.  She  is
    in a genuine marriage, has no  bad  immigration  history,  no  criminal
    record.  He submitted that she cannot live far away  from  her  husband
    and that removing the appellant is not a sensible approach.  He  relied
    on the grounds of appeal.

The Respondent's Submissions

10. The respondent served a Rule  24  (of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008) response.  It  is  asserted  that  the  appellant
    could not meet the terms of Appendix FM-SE.  It is asserted that in any
    event the respondent fails to see the materiality under the Immigration
    Rules given the secondary finding that the appellant had failed to pass
    her Life in the UK test notwithstanding  her  previous  five  attempts.
    The respondent also asserts that in terms of insurmountable  obstacles,
    given that the appellant spoke at the hearing in Gujarati and both  the
    appellant and sponsor have family in India where they both lived  prior
    to coming to the UK, it is submitted that the  appellant's  application
    amounts to no more than a disagreement with the  reasoned  findings  of
    the judge.  The  respondent  notes  that  at  paragraph  12  the  judge
    recorded the submission "they could not live together in India as  they
    plan to spend their future  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  raise  their
    children here".

11. Mr Avery relied on the Rule 24 response.  He submitted that the grounds
    and the submissions did not identify an error of law in the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision.  He asserted that the appellant has not  pointed  to
    any error of law with regard to the finding that the specified evidence
    required in Appendix FM-SE.  He submitted that there was nothing in the
    grounds or submissions to indicate  that  the  judge's  application  of
    Appendix FM EX.1 was incorrect.  He submitted that  there  was  nothing
    that indicated that the judge should have gone on to consider Article 8
    outside the Rules, there were no compelling  circumstances  arising  in
    this case.  He referred to the grant of permission and the reference to
    the case of SS (Congo).  He submitted that it is difficult to  see  how
    this case would assist the appellant as it confirms that  there  is  no
    need to go on to consider Article 8 outside the Rules if there  are  no
    factors or circumstances that have not been considered under the Rules.
     He also observed that the case of SS (Congo) had not been  promulgated
    when the First-tier Tribunal heard this case.  He submitted that  there
    was no error of law and that should the appellant  be  unsuccessful  in
    this appeal it is open to the appellant to make another application  if
    circumstances have changed.

The appellant's response

12. In reply Mr Sharma submitted that I was entitled to take  the  evidence
    regarding the English language and Life in the UK test into account, as
    this was an in-country appeal.  He submitted that the appellant came to
    the UK in accordance with the law and was granted permission  to  enter
    the UK.  If there is a problem with regard to something technical, then
    there are insufficient grounds to remove the  appellant.   He  asserted
    that unless the Home Office could establish that the  appellant  was  a
    terrorist or suffered an illness that would affect the whole of London,
    then there were no grounds for removing the appellant from  the  United
    Kingdom.

Discussion

13. Although the appellant asserts that she met the requirements  under  E-
    LTRP.3.1 in terms of the financial requirements, the judge  records  at
    paragraph 18 that the appellant has  not  provided  the  very  specific
    evidence that is required under Appendix FM-SE to  establish  that  she
    meets the income threshold.  The judge sets out how  that  evidence  is
    deficient.  At paragraph 18 the judge notes:

         "...The evidence which she has failed to provide includes: a letter
         from her employer and Mr Odedra's employer confirming that the  pay
         slips provided are authentic; a letter from each of their employers
         confirming their employment, their gross annual salary, the  length
         of their employment, the period over which they have been paid  the
         level of salary relied upon in the  application  and  the  type  of
         employment involved; and personal bank statements covering the same
         period as the pay slips showing that the salary has been paid  into
         an account in the name of the person or in the name of  the  person
         and their partner jointly.  This information is required in respect
         of both the  appellant's  employment  and  Mr  Odedra's  employment
         because neither of them individually earn above the minimum �18,600
         income threshold.  The appellant has not provided any  evidence  to
         show that she has sufficient savings to meet the requirements of E-
         LTRP.3.1(b) or that she meets the requirements of E-LTRP.3.1.(c)".

14. It is worth setting out the provisions relating to evidence referred to
    by the judge in full. Appendix FM-SE at paragraph 2:

         2. In respect of  salaried  employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
         paragraph 9  applies),  all  of  the  following  evidence  must  be
         provided:

         (a) Payslips covering:

             (i) a period of 6 months prior to the date of  application  if
             the person has been employed by their current employer for  at
             least 6 months (and where paragraph  13(b)  of  this  Appendix
             does not apply); or ...

          (b) A letter from the  employer(s)  who  issued  the  payslips  at
         paragraph 2(a) confirming:

              (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;

             (ii) the length of their employment;

             (iii) the period over which they have been or  were  paid  the
             level of salary relied upon in the application; and

             (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or
             agency).

         (c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period(s) as
         the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the  salary  has  been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the  name  of
         the person and their partner jointly

15. The appellant has not addressed the judge's findings in relation to the
    requirement for this specific evidence in the grounds  of  appeal  and,
    despite requests from me to do so at the hearing, Mr Sharma  could  not
    identify documents that were before the First-tier Tribunal judge  that
    met those requirements.

16. All of the requirements in Paragraph 2 must be met. I  have  considered
    very carefully the documents that were before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge, as set out by the judge in paragraph 18  of  the  decision.   Mr
    Sharma could not refer me to documents that were before the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge that did cover the requisite period, which he agreed was
    September 2013 to  April  2014,  which  met  all  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE. I do not accept Mr Sharma's submission that I can  take
    into account, when deciding whether or not there was an error of law in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, evidence that was  not  before
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge. I do not accept Mr  Sharma's  submission
    that there was a duty on the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  to  ask  the
    respondent to provide documents that the judge  had  no  knowledge  of.
    This was the appellant's appeal. It was for the appellant to prove  her
    case before the First-tier Tribunal. The appellant provided a bundle of
    documents for the hearing. If there were other documents that had  been
    submitted to the Secretary of State then the appellant  ought  to  have
    provided them for the hearing or at the very least have  raised  as  an
    issue that  there  were  documents  that  had  been  submitted  to  the
    Secretary of State that were not in the bundle. I have not taken any of
    the evidence that was not before the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  into
    consideration when arriving at my conclusion on error of law.

17. The appellant has failed to demonstrate that she provided the  specific
    evidence required  under  Appendix  FM-SE.   All  the  requirements  in
    paragraph 2 must be met.  The judge's finding that  the  appellant  did
    not meet the financial requirements was correct on the evidence  before
    him.

18. In any event, as asserted by the respondent, the appellant  has  failed
    to satisfy the English language requirement in E-LTRP.4.1.   There  has
    been no appeal  against  that  finding  of  the  judge,  therefore  the
    appellant also did not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    on  the  basis  that  she  failed  to  satisfy  the  English   language
    requirement.

19. The judge considered whether the  appellant  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM.  The issue in the case is whether  or
    not there were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing
    outside the UK.   The  judge  set  out  that  insurmountable  obstacles
    requires very significant difficulties faced by the  applicant  or  the
    partner in continuing family life outside the UK and which could not be
    overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the appellant or her
    partner.   The  judge  notes  that   the   case   law   suggests   that
    insurmountable should not be read as impossible but that  it  raises  a
    higher test than reasonable to expect (paragraph 20).

20. The judge has applied the correct test. In R  (on  the  application  of
    Agyarko and others) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015]
    EWCA Civ 440, (2015) ('Agyarko') the Court of appeal held:

         '[21]  The  phrase  "insurmountable  obstacles"  as  used  in  this
         paragraph of the Rules clearly imposes a high hurdle to be overcome
         by an Applicant for leave to remain under the Rules.  The  test  is
         significantly more demanding than a mere test of whether  it  would
         be reasonable to expect a couple  to  continue  their  family  life
         outside the United Kingdom.

         [22] This interpretation is in line with  the  relevant  Strasbourg
         jurisprudence. The phrase "insurmountable obstacles" has its origin
         in the Strasbourg jurisprudence in relation to immigration cases in
         a family context, where it is mentioned as one factor among  others
         to be taken into account in determining whether any right under art
         8 exists for family members to be granted leave to remain or  leave
         to enter a Contracting State:  see  e.g.  Rodrigues  da  Silva  and
         Hoogkamer v Netherlands (2007) 44 EHRR 34, para 39 (". . .  whether
         there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family  living
         together in the country of origin of one or more of them .  .  .").
         The phrase as used in the  Rules  is  intended  to  have  the  same
         meaning as in the Strasbourg jurisprudence. It is  clear  that  the
         ECtHR regards it as a formulation  imposing  a  stringent  test  in
         respect of that factor, as is illustrated by Jeunesse v Netherlands
         (see para 117: there were no insurmountable obstacles to the family
         settling in Suriname, even though  the  Applicant  and  her  family
         would experience hardship if forced to do so).

         [23]  For  clarity,  two  points   should   be   made   about   the
         "insurmountable obstacles" criterion. First, although it involves a
         stringent test, it is obviously intended in both the  case-law  and
         the Rules to be interpreted in a sensible and practical rather than
         a purely literal way ...

         [25] ...The mere facts that Mr Benette is a  British  Citizen,  has
         lived all his life in the United Kingdom and has a job here  -  and
         hence might find it difficult and might be reluctant  to  re-locate
         to Ghana to continue their family life there- could not  constitute
         insurmountable obstacles to his doing so.'

21. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT  640
    (IAC)  it  was  held  that  the  term  'insurmountable  obstacles'   in
    provisions such as Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are  impossible
    to surmount: they concern the practical possibilities of relocation.

22. At paragraph 21 the judge considered that the appellant and  Mr  Odedra
    have both spent the significant majority of their lives  in  India  and
    that there are therefore no significant language or  cultural  barriers
    to prevent them from re-establishing themselves  in  their  country  of
    birth.  The judge notes that the parents of the appellant and Mr Odedra
    continue to live in India, as does the sister of Mr  Odedra,  and  that
    there would therefore be relatives in India to support and assist  them
    on their arrival.  He notes that the couple have no children  or  other
    significant ties to this country.  The judge notes that they  are  both
    in paid employment in the UK but finds that this does not amount to  an
    insurmountable obstacle and that it would be open to them to seek  work
    in India.  The judge notes also that the appellant and Mr  Odedra  have
    some savings which would assist  them.   The  judge's  conclusion  that
    there were no insurmountable obstacles was one that  was  open  to  the
    judge.  As held  in  Agyarko,  the  test  of  insurmountable  obstacles
    imposes a high hurdle to be overcome  by  an  applicant  for  leave  to
    remain under the Rules, the test is not whether it would be  reasonable
    to expect a couple to continue their family  life  outside  the  United
    Kingdom, it is a much more stringent test.  The judge did  not  err  in
    finding that there were no insurmountable obstacles  on  the  facts  of
    this case.

23. There was no appeal against the judge's findings in relation to private
    life under paragraph 276ADE.

24. The appellant asserts that the  judge  erred  by  failing  to  consider
    Article 8  outside  the  Rules  and  in  not  applying  the  systematic
    balancing exercise as laid down in Razgar.   At  paragraph  22  of  the
    decision the judge considered whether there were any  features  of  the
    appellant's case which are not covered by the Rules and upon which  her
    appeal might succeed under Article 8  outside  the  Rules.   The  judge
    found that there were none.  As set out  in  the  case  of  R  (on  the
    application of Sunassee)  v  Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum
    Chamber) [2015] EWHC 1604 (Admin) the court held at paragraph 36:

         "In SS (Congo) the  Court  of  Appeal  re-stated  the  context  and
         considered the role of public policy as expressed in the  Rules  in
         the proportionality assessment.   This  is  at  the  heart  of  the
         present issue.  The law is, as I have said, that the decision maker
         is entitled to decide that Article 8 considerations have been fully
         addressed in the Rules when dealing  with  'stage  two'.   If  they
         have, it is enough  to  say  so.   This  will  necessarily  involve
         deciding whether there is a 'gap' between the Rules and Article  8,
         and  then  whether  there  are  circumstances  in  the  case  under
         consideration that take it outside the class  of  cases  which  the
         Rules  properly  provide  for.   Whether  these  circumstances  are
         described as 'compelling' or  'exceptional'  is  not  a  matter  of
         substance.  They must be relevant, weighty, and not fully  provided
         for within the Rules.  In practice  they  are  likely  to  be  both
         compelling and exceptional, but this is not  a  legal  requirement.
         ..."

25. The appellant has  not  identified  any  circumstances  that  have  not
    already been  considered  under  the  Immigration  Rules  when  it  was
    considered whether or not there were insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    appellant's family life continuing outside the UK.  In the  absence  of
    any compelling reasons as to  why  her  case  ought  to  be  considered
    outside the Rules, the judge was correct in his assessment  that  there
    were no features of the appellant's case that were not covered  by  the
    Rules.

26. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously. Having
    considered all the circumstances and evidence  I  do  not  consider  it
    necessary to make an anonymity direction.

Notice of Decision

The appellant has not discharged the burden of satisfying me that there  was
any error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision without which  it  is
not capable of being set-aside. The appeal is  dismissed.  The  decision  of
the Secretary of State stands.
