    Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

         Upon the parties being agreed that the determination in the  First-
         tier Tribunal promulgated on 20 January 2014 discloses  a  material
         error of law and that it should be set aside.

         And upon the parties agreeing that the  evidence  establishes  that
         the sponsor Mr Kostandin Gjoni is  a  person  exercising  a  treaty
         right in accordance with Directive 2004/EC/38.

         And upon the parties agreeing the  appellant  is  a  family  member
         within the meaning of Article 2(2) of the Directive 2004/EC/38

         It is ordered that:

         1.   The appeal be allowed.

         2.   The appellant is  entitled  to  be  issued  with  a  residence
         permit.

         3.   That there be a partial award to the appellant within 28  days
             in the amount of ï¿½70 being half the fee.

    The appeal in the Upper Tribunal is therefore allowed.  The decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside  for  legal  error.   The  appeal
    against the decision giving  rise  to  the  appeal  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is allowed.
