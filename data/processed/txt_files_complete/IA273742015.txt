                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appeal came before the Upper Tribunal for an error of law  hearing
on 17 October 2017. In a decision and  reasons  promulgated  on  23  October
2017, the Upper Tribunal found material errors of law  in  the  decision  of
First tier Tribunal Sullivan and the appeal was adjourned for a  hearing  de
novo before the Upper Tribunal. A copy of that decision is appended.



Hearing

2.    I heard evidence from the Appellant, who  confirmed  the  contents  of
his statement, dated 12.12.16 and his statement dated 29.12.17 at pages  14-
19 of the supplementary bundle. In response to supplementary questions  from
Mr Blundell, the Appellant stated that when  he  travelled  on  his  own  to
Pakistan and his brother remained with his family in the UK, they had a  lot
of trouble and in order to restrain his brother he used to talk to him  over
the phone. The reason the family had a tough time with his brother  is  that
he used to take his brother out to different things and he needs  that,  but
in his absence that was not possible and then he used to talk  to  him  over
the phone. The Appellant stated that whilst his intention  was  to  be  away
for a month he was trying to bring his brother's son back to the  UK  so  it
took him longer, about 6 weeks.

This was in 2014. The Appellant said that prior to that, in  2011  possibly,
he had been to Pakistan for 25 days. He had intended to go for a  month  and
a half but he was needed here so he came back. When asked  to  clarify,  the
Appellant stated that as his brother has got that health problem he is  like
a child and over these 10 years he has got used to him taking him  out  e.g.
for a walk and he also takes him to his friends, to the mosque  as  well  as
for a haircut. The Appellant stated that his brother cannot wash  or  shower
himself. He said his brother is frightened by different things  e.g.  he  is
afraid of helicopter noise and also fireworks noises. When the curtains  are
open he wants to have them closed.

3.    When asked about the trip his brother and his family took to  Pakistan
in 2014 the Appellant said that this was because  their  remaining  brothers
and their father and mother had been waiting for him  as  he  had  not  been
there for a long time. The reason they went on their  own  without  him  was
that he had no visa so was unable to travel but he took them to the  airport
and on their return he collected them from the airport. Due  to  not  having
his visa he  was  unable  to  travel  with  them  otherwise  he  would  have
definitely accompanied them. When asked  how  his  brother  and  the  family
managed without him when they were outside  the  UK  he  said  that  as  the
family is very big they were staying  with  them,  including  his  brothers,
parents and wider family, but still he  was  missing  here.  When  asked  to
clarify this answer the Appellant stated that if he stays in  one  place  he
cannot stay still there and wants to go  back  to  the  previous  place  and
while obviously he missed his  parents  and  his  family  (in  Pakistan)  he
wanted to come back here to the UK as he had the accident here and  survived
and it was a new beginning and a new life for him.

4.    In cross-examination by Ms Ahmad, the Appellant was  asked  about  the
problems his brother's family had when the Appellant  went  to  Pakistan  in
2014 and he said that as his brother is not well, he gets depressed at  home
so he wants to go out and to see his friends or be taken for a walk and  his
wife has Hepatitis C and she  cannot  look  after  herself,  therefore,  she
cannot manage to look after him. When asked why his children could not  take
him for a walk, the Appellant stated that he has young daughters and in  his
culture they do not take young girls to different people's homes  as  it  is
not in the culture and what he does is to take him to  his  friends'  houses
or bring them to him and they play cards:  Tash,  which  is  played  with  4
individuals. The Appellant said that his brother is a  stubborn  person  and
sometimes he does  not  listen  and  does  not  listen  to  the  girls,  his
daughters e.g. if you take him a particular route and he does  not  want  to
go that route the girls cannot make him go that route, but with  him  he  is
ok and listens to him.

5.    When asked  about  washing  himself  the  Appellant  stated  that  his
brother does not take showers unless he take his clothes off  and  sits  him
down in the bath and gets him washed. Apart from that he pulls out his  hair
and body hair and leaves it on the floor and picks hairs  out  one  by  one.
The Appellant says that he takes his brother to the hairdresser. When  asked
if anyone else helps his brother to take a shower  he  said  that  his  wife
washes him, if he has helped by getting his brother  undressed  and  in  the
bath.

6.    The Appellant was asked about his brother's medication and  he  stated
that his brother used to take 7 different items of medication but  currently
he is taking 3, however, whenever he is getting pain he takes  the  other  4
or if he pulls his hair out he also takes those. The Appellant said that  he
did not know the names of the medicines because he  does  not  know  English
but he had  them  with  him,  outside  the  courtroom.  When  asked  how  he
differentiates between the tablets he said that one of the tablets  that  he
takes twice a day is for the attack and the second  one  is  for  sleep  and
tranquillity and the third one which he takes up to 3 tablets a day  is  for
when he is pulling his hair out.  The  Appellant  said  that  his  brother's
daughters and his wife can also give him his medication, but when  they  are
together the Appellant makes him and encourages him to take his tablets.

7.    The Appellant was asked whether his brother suffers from a  depressive
disorder and anger outbursts  and  he  agreed  and  said  that  his  brother
suddenly gets very angry but can be comforted by little things  e.g.  Pashto
drumming and that changes his mood. When asked for an example he  said  that
his brother does get angry a lot over very trivial things and it  happens  a
lot when he does not like a word or something  he  gets  angry.  When  asked
when he last did this the Appellant stated that his brother gets angry in  a
second and just yesterday when he was trying to find the court, he took  his
brother out and brought him with him to refresh him.  When  they  reached  a
bus stop the Appellant wanted to go towards the bus  stop  but  his  brother
did not want to go and told him  that  he  wanted  to  go  in  the  opposite
direction. The Appellant had to listen  to  him,  he  calmed  him  down  and
explained where he wanted to go and he was OK.  When asked  if  he  intended
to work if he were to be granted leave, the Appellant  stated  that  he  was
serving his brother and looking after him and that was all he can do.

8.    In response to questions from the Upper Tribunal the Appellant  stated
that his brother has a son, who was born on [ ] 2002. When asked  about  the
relationship between his brother and his son aged  15,  the  Appellant  said
that they do not get on well because his brother is an ill  person  and  the
son is very young and they have communication problems.  He  said  that  his
nephew does not help at all in terms of his  father's  care  because  he  is
going to school, he is a child and his father does not listen to him.

9.    I heard  submissions  from  Ms  Ahmad,  who  sought  to  rely  on  the
decisions of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  dated  20  July  2015  and  the
judgments of the Court of Appeal in Kopoi [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1511;  Rhuppiah
[2016] EWCA Civ 803 and Rajendran [2016] UKUT 00138  (IAC).  In  respect  of
the previous decisions of the First tier Tribunal, allowing the  Appellant's
appeals, she submitted that her reading  of  Judge  Maxwell's  decision  was
that he allowed the appeal on the basis of the lack of care the  Appellant's
brother was receiving. In her submission that is the limit of  the  decision
and he did not look into the question of family life between  the  Appellant
and the Sponsor.

She submitted that the Appellant does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
Rules. Ms Ahmad sought to rely on the judgment in Kopoi  (op  cit)  at  [20]
and [21] and Kugathas [2003] EWCA  Civ  31.  She  submitted  that  there  is
substantial evidence that the Appellant's brother is in  need  of  help  and
assistance  and  whilst  she  was  not  seeking  to  make  a  challenge   to
credibility they  have  spent  time  apart  for  some  periods  and  in  her
submission this requires consideration.

10.   Ms Ahmad submitted that  if  I  was  satisfied  that  family  life  is
engaged, then it was developed when the  Appellant's  leave  was  precarious
cf. the headnote in Rajendran (op cit) however, she  acknowledged  that  the
judgment in Rhuppiah (op  cit)  is  more  favourable  to  the  Appellant  in
respect of the question of precariousness when Article  8  is  in  play  and
this goes to the question of the weight to be attached. Ms Ahmad  also  drew
attention to the Appellant's immigration history in  this  country  and  his
inability to speak English and support himself. She submitted that  Rhuppiah
makes it very clear these can be negative and neutral factors that  need  to
be taken into account and have a significant impact on the public  interest.
She submitted that the Appellant does have a  nuclear  family  in  Pakistan,
who he visited a number of years ago. The Appellant has spent only the  last
few years in this country and in her submission, considering the  fact  that
the  Appellant's  brother  has  his  wife  and  children  in  this  country,
interference with family life would be  proportionate.  Ms  Ahmad  clarified
that she was not conceding there is family life between  the  Appellant  and
his brother but she was not challenging his evidence.

11.   In his submissions, Mr Blundell submitted that  this  could  genuinely
aptly be described as a heartbreaking case. [MS] was attacked in the  course
of his work as a minicab driver  and  the  history  and  sentencing  of  the
attacker is set out in the decision of Judge Pullig in 2010.  The  Appellant
was then contacted by the Metropolitan police to ask  whether  he  would  be
prepared to come to the UK to support his brother. The Appellant decided  in
2008 to leave his own family in Pakistan and come to the UK to care for  his
brother.

12.   Mr Blundell submitted that the Appellant's brother's  current  medical
predicament is best summarised in the: (i) GP letter of 1.8.17;  (ii)  Annie
Williams letter of 30.11.16 and  (iii)  Hugh  Jones  letter  of  8.2.16.  In
respect of his previous health issues, these comprised  a  back  injury  and
Hepatitis C which  pre-dated  the  traumatic  head  injury,  but  which  has
precipitated these issues. He submitted  that  the  Appellant's  brother  is
like a child and being essentially unmanageable for  the  remaining  members
of the household. As the Appellant explained, the fact  that  his  brother's
symptoms are unmanageable does not stem simply from the  fact  that  he  has
been responsible for his care since  2008  but  there  is  also  a  cultural
element at play and his brother will not accept instruction  from  his  wife
or adult daughters. The Appellant was asked  a  number  of  questions  about
medication to ascertain whether he is on top  of  his  brother's  medication
regime and his evidence is entirely plausible and chimes with  the  evidence
at page 1 of the bundle, which is the list of medication his brother takes.

13.   In respect of the family's ability to manage when they  were  away  in
Pakistan, the Appellant's brother will  listen  to  a  male  member  of  the
family, including his own father.  However,  when  the  Appellant  was  away
(visiting his own family) they did not cope very well. As he  explained  the
reality was that he hoped to be able to spend a month to a month and a  half
but had to return to the UK after 25 days. He tried  to  manage  by  way  of
phone calls but it did not  work  so  he  had  to  come  back.  Mr  Blundell
submitted that the evidence from the advanced nurse practitioner at page  12
of the supplementary bundle should be accepted as an accurate  statement  of
the family's circumstances.

14.   Mr Blundell submitted that the judgments in Kugathas (op cit) and  Rai
[2017] EWCA Civ 320 are fact specific and are not relevant to the  facts  of
this case. The test remains whether there are  more  than  normal  emotional
ties between the Appellant and his brother. He submitted that  the  starting
point must be what is said by the nurse practitioner at  page  12  and  this
really chimes with what was said by  Judge  Pullig  in  2010  and  by  Judge
Clarke in 2012 i.e. that the family have fallen through the net. The  Judges
adopted the Respondent's stance as set out in her Carers'  policy  at  17.5.
and the fact that arrangements for [MS]'s care have  been  made  within  the
family and that Social Services have confirmed to  the  Respondent  that  no
care plan is in place. Considering the circumstances as of today's date,  Mr
Blundell submitted that the reality is  clear  and  the  family  would  find
themselves in a desperate situation with no male  figure  in  the  house  to
whom the Appellant's brother would listen in order to  bathe  himself,  take
his medication, get  out  of  the  house  and  manage  a  host  of  symptoms
including pulling his hair out. Whilst it is possible that  social  services
could eventually be persuaded to put  something  in  place,  both  male  and
female carers present a problem so the only solution may well be care  in  a
residential institution. Simply, it would be a catastrophe  for  the  family
if the Appellant is not permitted to remain in the UK.

15.   Mr Blundell submitted that the only question for  the  Upper  Tribunal
is whether those consequences amount to unjustifiably harsh consequences  so
as  to  render  removal  disproportionate.  The  relationship  between   the
brothers has deepened through lawful periods of leave and the fact  that  he
has held such leave for such a  long  time  is  relevant  to  assessment  of
proportionality  and  can  be   balanced   against   the   public   interest
considerations. There is a good reason why  the  Appellant  does  not  speak
English and the Respondent has failed to adhere to her own policy  in  terms
of identifying adequate alternative care arrangements.

16.   In respect of section 55 and the Appellant's  nephew,  Judge  Sullivan
found he would remain with his parents. However,  the  precise  consequences
for the boy are not entirely clear but would result in a diminution  of  his
quality of life as he would become a  child  carer  as  the  only  realistic
person who could take his father in hand, which would  be  contrary  to  his
best interests.

17.   I reserved my decision, which I now give with my reasons.

Findings

18.   It is not disputed that the Appellant does not meet  the  requirements
of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  there  is  no  provision  that  covers  his
particular factual circumstances.

19.   I firstly consider whether the requirements of  Article  8(1)  of  the
ECHR are met i.e. whether the Appellant has established  family  or  private
life in the UK. He first arrived on 8 March 2008 as a visitor,  having  been
asked to come to the UK by the Metropolitan police to care for his  brother.
He made an in-time application for further leave to remain, as a  result  of
which further leave was granted from 12 October 2008 to 12 January  2009.  A
further application for leave was  refused,  but  following  a  decision  by
Judge Pullig promulgated on 3 February 2010, his appeal was allowed and  the
Appellant was given further leave to remain from  12  November  2010  to  12
November 2011. A  third  application  for  further  leave  was  refused  but
following a  successful  appeal  before  Judge  Clarke,  the  Appellant  was
granted further leave from 31 October 2012 to  31  October  2013.  A  fourth
application for further leave was also refused but  following  a  successful
appeal before Judge Maxwell, leave was granted from 12 September 2014 to  15
March 2015. A fifth in time application for leave to remain was  refused  on
20 July 2015 and on appeal to  the  First  tier  Tribunal,  the  appeal  was
dismissed by Judge Sullivan. That decision was set  aside  by  virtue  of  a
decision by the Upper Tribunal promulgated on 23 October 2017.  In  summary,
I find that the Appellant has resided in  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to
lawful periods of leave since 8 March 2008, almost 10 years.

20.   I have had regard to the decisions  by  the  previous  Judges  of  the
First tier Tribunal, bearing in mind the decision in Devaseelan  [2003]  Imm
AR 1. It is clear from the decision of Judge Pullig that  he  considered  it
necessary for the Appellant to remain in the UK  to  care  for  his  brother
until "suitable proper arrangements" could be made for him to be  cared  for
[51]. It is clear from [49] that Judge Pullig  considered  that:  "strenuous
efforts ought to be made by Social Services and not the  family  to  find  a
suitable carer who will be able to provide live-in care for  [MS]."  In  her
decision of 14 September 2012, Judge Clarke  noted  that  the  existence  of
family life had been conceded in the appeal before Judge Pullig.  The  Judge
expressly  accepted   at   [14]   that   Social   Services   had   abdicated
responsibility for the care of his brother to the  Appellant  and  that  the
approach of the Social Services was  contrary  to  the  Respondent's  (then)
policy in respect of carers. It is clear that in allowing the  appeal  Judge
Clarke relied upon the history  of  the  case  and  the  findings  of  Judge
Pullig. The next appeal was before Judge Maxwell on  31  March  2014.  In  a
decision and reasons promulgated on 14 April 2014, Judge Maxwell  noted  the
absence of any progress  by  Social  Services  in  providing  care  for  the
Appellant and allowed the appeal on  the  basis  that  6  months  leave  was
appropriate for both parties to make efforts to resolve the care situation.

21.   I am mindful that  the  decision  in  Devaseelan  (op  cit)  does  not
mandate that the same decision is reached by a  later  Tribunal  but  simply
that previous judicial decision(s) are  the  starting  point.  At  [37]  the
Tribunal held:

    "The first Adjudicator's determination  stands  (unchallenged,  or  not
    successfully challenged) as an assessment of the  claim  the  Appellant
    was then making, at the time of that determination. It is  not  binding
    on  the  second  Adjudicator;  but,  on  the  other  hand,  the  second
    Adjudicator is not hearing an appeal against it. As  an  assessment  of
    the matters that were before the first Adjudicator it should simply  be
    regarded as unquestioned. It may be built upon, and, as a  result,  the
    outcome of the hearing before  the  second  Adjudicator  may  be  quite
    different from what might have been expected  from  a  reading  of  the
    first determination only."



22.   I find that eight years after the decision of Judge  Pullig  there  is
still no care  plan  in  place  for  the  Appellant.  Mr  Blundell  drew  my
attention to an internal minute  produced  by  the  Home  Office  Presenting
Officer at the hearing before Judge Sullivan which provides that:

    "I was provided with an email dated 17.7.15 and a  case  referral  note
    dated 14.7.15  which  stated  that  the  Appellant's  brother  was  not
    receiving support from social services because he had immediate  family
    members to care for him."

23.   Mr Blundell also  drew  my  attention  to  the  relevant  Home  Office
policy, Chapter 17, section 2 of the Immigration  Directorate  Instructions,
last updated on 4.12.13, which provides at 17.5:

    "If  caseworkers  are  intending  to  refuse  an  application  from  an
    applicant who wishes to provide care for a  relative  in  the  UK,  the
    Secretary of State must be able to show that  s/he  is  satisfied  that
    there would be alternative arrangements for care should  the  applicant
    not be available.

    The fact that an applicant may be able to provide the best care for the
    patient does not mean that the patient cannot be adequately  cared  for
    by the local authority. Local authorities  are  under  a  duty  to  put
    themselves in a position to arrange suitable care for all categories of
    people in respect of whom they have community care functions.

    If social services are involved caseworkers should send them  a  letter
    asking whether the carer has made alternative arrangements and  if  not
    what kind of alternative arrangements could be made."

24.   I am satisfied in light of the  internal  minute  emanating  from  the
Home Office, that the Respondent has failed to  show  that  there  would  be
alternative  care  arrangements  for  the  Appellant's  brother   were   the
Appellant to be removed from the  UK.  Given  that  the  Appellant  has  now
resided in the UK for almost 10 years and the Respondent has been on  notice
since the decision of Judge Pullig, 8 years ago, that it was incumbent  upon
Social Services to make alternative care arrangements, and  none  have  been
made, the Respondent cannot meet the requirements  set  out  in  her  policy
above. I consider that this is a factor relevant to the  assessment  of  the
proportionality of the Appellant's  removal,  given  that  the  Respondent's
decision is effectively not in accordance with the  law  cf.  Razgar  [2004]
UKHL 27 at [17] (3).

25.   I have also considered whether the family would be in  a  position  to
provide alternative care  in  the  absence  of  the  Appellant  and  I  have
concluded that due to cultural norms, the  burden  of  providing  this  care
would fall heavily upon the Appellant's 15 year old  son  and  I  accept  Mr
Blundell's submission that he would, in effect,  become  a  child  carer  by
default and this would not be in his best interests and thus be contrary  to
section 55 of the BCIA 2009.

26.   I note that Judge Sullivan concluded that  the  Appellant's  brother's
condition had materially improved, however,  Mr  Blundell  took  issue  with
that finding and as this is a hearing de novo I have considered the  medical
evidence to ascertain the current health  status  and  requirements  of  the
Appellant's brother, in particular,  whether  he  still  requires  the  same
level of care that he has done since he was seriously assaulted in 2008.

27.   The letter  from  Dr  Jones,  consultant  psychiatrist,  dated  8.2.16
states that:

    "Currently [MS] presents with very significant symptoms. These  include
    a significant disturbance in his mood and level of anxiety ... [MS] has
    presented during the six  months  with  our  service  as  significantly
    impaired and this is compatible with his presentation  to  services  in
    2011. It would seem that he has an essentially static  condition  which
    requires significant care  from  others  ...  The  cognitive  mood  and
    anxiety symptoms that [MS] has are likely to have an impact  on  almost
    all aspects of his life and social functioning. Currently  he  requires
    care from members of the family on a 24 hour basis and indeed, were  he
    not living with a supportive family, would need to  live  in  supported
    care."

28.    A  letter  from  Annie  Williams,  Advanced   Nurse   Mental   Health
Practitioner dated 30.11.16 provides inter alia that "without the  brother's
help the wife and daughters would not be able  to  care  for  [MS]  as  they
would only be able to provide his basic needs such  as  providing  him  with
food. However they do not feel strong enough to manage  his  aggression  and
his violence."

29.   A letter from the Appellant's GP, Dr  Hossain,  dated  1.8.17,  is  in
line with the evidence set out above.

30.   I find in light of the medical evidence before  me  that  the  medical
condition of the Appellant's brother, [MS], has not improved, materially  or
otherwise. Whilst as was made clear in the oral evidence, the Appellant  has
been able to visit his own family in  Pakistan,  the  Appellant's  wife  and
daughters struggled to care for [MS] in the Appellant's absence and  I  find
that it would place an intolerable burden  on  Mrs  [S],  who  has  her  own
health problems, the two teenage daughters and teenage son if the  Appellant
were to be required to leave the UK.

31.   The existence of family life  was  conceded  before  Judge  Pullig  in
2010. Whilst Ms Ahmad was not in a position to do so at the  hearing  before
me, I find that if  the  Respondent  accepted  that  family  life  had  been
established between the Appellant and his brother in 2010, given  that  they
have remained in the same household and the Appellant has continued to  care
for his brother since that time, clearly family life has  continued  between
them since that time. I also find that the Appellant is an integral part  of
his brother's family since he resides not only with his  brother,  but  also
with his brother's wife and three children. However, there was  no  evidence
before me to show that the relationship the Appellant has  with  his  nieces
and nephew  constitutes  a  parental  relationship  within  the  meaning  of
section 117B(6) of the NIAA 2002.

32.   In considering the proportionality of the  Respondent's  decision  not
to grant the Appellant leave to  remain,  I  have  attached  weight  to  the
public interest considerations, particularly those set out in section  117A-
D of the NIAA 2002. None of those  considerations  particularly  assist  the
Appellant, given that  he  does  not  speak  English  and  is  not  in  paid
employment, due to the fact that he cares for  his  brother.  There  was  no
evidence before me, however, to show that the presence of the  Appellant  in
the UK places an additional burden on the public purse and in his  decision,
Judge Pullig found at [5] that the entire family are  funded  by  a  cousin,
[ZH], who also gave evidence at that appeal hearing. Whilst family life  has
been established whilst the Appellant has been lawfully present in the UK  I
find that, albeit his leave is based on family rather than private life,  it
is precarious as it is been predicated solely upon his care for his  brother
cf. Rajendran (op cit) and that he cannot  at  the  outset  have  reasonably
have expected to remain in  the  UK  indefinitely  cf.  Rhuppiah  (op  cit).
Nevertheless, three previous judges have seen fit to allow  the  Appellant's
appeals on the basis of his family life with his  brother  and  because  his
presence in the UK was necessary in order to care for him and  he  has  been
lawfully present in the UK since March 2008.

33.   I have concluded on the particular facts of this  unusual  case  that,
given the Appellant's length of lawful residence,  the  significant  adverse
consequences for his brother and his brother's wife and  children  were  the
Appellant to be required to leave the UK and the failure  by  the  State  to
put in place any alternative care arrangements at any stage  over  the  past
almost 10 years, that it would be disproportionate to expect  the  Appellant
to leave the UK as this would bring  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for
the Appellant's brother and his family.

34.   I further consider that it is neither in the public  interest  nor  in
the interests of the Appellant, his brother and  his  brother's  family  for
this case to return to the Tribunal yet again, given that  there  have  been
four hearings before the First tier Tribunal  and  three  before  the  Upper
Tribunal over the past 8 years. On that  basis  I  would  request  that  the
Respondent give consideration to a grant  of  leave  commensurate  with  the
costs already incurred and  the  reasons  I  have  given  for  allowing  the
appeal.
