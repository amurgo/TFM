                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
Appellant   Mr Plowright, Counsel, instructed by Nasim and Co Solicitors
Respondent  Mr Bramble (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, citizens of Nigeria, applied for  leave  to  remain  on
    September 11, 2012 on the grounds that removal would place  the  United
    Kingdom in breach of its obligations under the Human  Rights  Act  1998
    The respondent refused their applications on April 30,  2014  and  gave
    directions under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999  for
    removal from the United Kingdom.

 2. The appellants appealed those decisions on May 14, 2014  under  section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The appeals came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Adio  on  June
    3, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on June 25, 2015 he  allowed  the
    second-named appellant's appeal under the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
    first and third-named appellants' appeals under ECHR legislation.

 4. The respondent sought permission to appeal that  decision  on  July  2,
    2015 on the grounds the Tribunal had failed to provide adequate reasons
    on a material matter and/or by making a material misdirection  of  law.
    Judge of the first-tier Tribunal Andrew granted permission to appeal on
    October 6, 2015. The matter came before me on January  8,  2016  and  I
    accepted on that date there was an error in law.

 5. The case was adjourned and next came before me on March 31, 2016 and on
    that date a new issue was raised. In short, it was now argued that  the
    first-named appellant was the husband of an EEA  national  and  as  his
    wife had been here continuously for more than five years and exercising
    treaty rights then the  first-named  appellant  would  be  entitled  to
    permanent residence  under  Regulation  15  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.

 6. I gave directions for service of evidence and that  included  provision
    for the respondent to obtain evidence from HMRC about  the  first-named
    appellant's wife's financial circumstances under Section 40 of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.

 7. A statement has now been received from HMRC dated September  19,  2016.
    That document  confirms  the  first-named  appellant's  wife  has  been
    exercising treaty rights in this country for five continuous years.

 8. In the circumstances Mr Bramble, on behalf of the respondent,  accepted
    the  first-named  appellant  satisfied  Regulation  16  of   the   2006
    Regulations. I therefore allow his appeal.

 9. In relation to the second and third  named  appellants  I  treat  their
    appeals as abandoned under Rule 17A of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008. They have each been granted leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom as British citizens  and  under  Rule  17A(1)  their
    appeals are treated as being abandoned.

10. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I see no reason to make an order now.

    DECISION


11. There was a material error and I set aside the earlier decisions.


12. I allow the first-named appellant's appeal under the Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.

13. The appeals of the second and third named  appellants  are  treated  as
    abandoned under Rule 17A of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.


Signed:                                 Dated: 11 August 20
