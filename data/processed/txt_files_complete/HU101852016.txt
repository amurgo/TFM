For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Cameroon who  appeals  now  against  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Fowell  which  was  promulgated  on  28
    February 2018 following a hearing at Birmingham (Priory  Court)  on  14
    February 2018 in which the judge had dismissed the  appellant's  appeal
    against the respondent's decision refusing his application for leave to
    remain in the UK under Article 8 on private and  family  life  grounds.
    This appeal was first before me on 12 September 2018 when I found  that
    Judge Fowell's decision had contained a material error of law such that
    the decision had to be remade and I decided that it was appropriate  in
    the circumstances of this case for the decision to  be  remade  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appeal then came before me again on 2 November when for  reasons  I
    gave following that hearing I decided after  an  application  had  been
    made by Mr Halim, who then represented the appellant as he  has  before
    the Tribunal today, that the hearing had to be adjourned further.  Much
    of what I said within the error of law decision  which  I  made  orally
    immediately  following  the  hearing  on  12  September  2018  will  be
    incorporated into this  decision  as  will  be  much  of  what  I  said
    immediately following the hearing on 2 November 2016.

 3. As I stated in my error of law decision, although  at  paragraph  1  of
    Judge Fowell's decision it is said that the appellant arrived  in  this
    country in 2009 on a student visa it had always been his case  that  he
    in fact arrived in January 2010 but nothing turned on this and  it  was
    common ground that after graduating  he  was  given  further  leave  to
    remain as a member of the Armed Forces until January 2014.   He  was  a
    reservist in the army and would have been deployed to  Afghanistan  but
    for an injury that he had sustained to his knee and in 2014 he served a
    tour of duty in Cyprus, apparently with the Irish Guards as part  of  a
    UN contingent returning on 10 February 2015.  As  I  recorded  in  that
    decision again it was common ground that during that period  whilst  he
    was serving as a full-time member of the Armed  Forces  he  was  exempt
    from immigration control.  However, he did not fulfil the  requirements
    necessary to be exempted from immigration control thereafter under  the
    various Armed Forces exemptions under the  Rules,  and  accordingly  he
    became without leave in or about  February  2015.   Thereafter  he  has
    remained in this country without leave.   It  is  also  the  case  that
    during an earlier period for about two or three months in 2013  he  was
    also in this country without leave.

 4. On 15 October 2015 at a time  when  the  appellant  had  been  in  this
    country without leave for over 28  days  he  made  an  application  for
    further leave to remain outside of the  Rules,  which  application  was
    refused on 9 March 2016 on the basis that he  had  requested  leave  to
    remain because of his employment at FDM Group which  he  had  not  been
    entitled to have.  He was still  apparently  a  member  of  HM  Reserve
    Forces, but he was discharged on 31 May 2017 because at  that  time  he
    did not have a right to remain in the UK.

 5. The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision  refusing  him
    leave to remain and his appeal was  heard  before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Bart-Stewart and following a hearing on 16  December  2016  in  a
    decision promulgated on 25 January 2017 Judge Bart-Stewart allowed  his
    appeal.

 6. The respondent  appealed  against  this  decision  and  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 22 September 2017, following a hearing on 31 July  2017,
    Upper Tribunal Judge Allen allowed the respondent's appeal,  set  aside
    Judge Bart-Stewart's decision and remitted the appeal for re-hearing at
    the First-tier Tribunal.  No findings were specifically retained and  I
    noted following the error of law hearing that although clearly it would
    have been open to Judge Allen had he so chosen  to  go  on  to  make  a
    finding himself that the appeal anyway must be dismissed on  the  basis
    of the material already before him, he chose not to do so.

 7. Accordingly when the appeal then came back before Judge Fowell  it  was
    on the basis that there was to be a re-hearing and the judge needed  to
    consider all the issues himself.

 8. Following this hearing Judge Fowell dismissed the appellant's appeal in
    a decision made on 28 February 2018 and it is this decision  which  has
    now been  appealed  to  this  Tribunal,  permission  to  appeal  having
    eventually been granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Coker on 12 July  2018.
    I will refer to Judge Coker's reasons for giving permission  to  appeal
    below.

 9. In the grounds the appellant takes issue with Judge  Fowell's  decision
    for a number of reasons.  It  is  said  that  he  had  failed  to  give
    adequate weight to  material  evidence  but  had  only  considered  the
    appellant's case on the basis that having originally being  a  student,
    following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Rhuppiah he ought,  as
    a student, to have been expected to leave the country at the end of his
    studies.  It was also submitted that the judge had failed to  give  any
    or any adequate weight to the appellant's exemplary army service.

10. In giving her reasons for granting permission  to  appeal  Judge  Coker
    stated as follows:

         "1.  Although the judge refers to  the  first  First-tier  Tribunal
             decision and that the facts are not in dispute,  it  does  not
             appear that he has taken account of  those  factual  findings.
             [This is a reference to the findings previously made by  Judge
             Bart-Stewart.]  Although he refers  to  the  value  of  public
             service  he  does  not  appear  to  have  factored  into   his
             assessment the service undertaken by  the  appellant  and  the
             evidence of Major Buchannan [who had  given  evidence  on  the
             appellant's behalf].

         2.   The grounds as pleaded are  arguable.   It  may  be  that  the
             outcome is the same namely the appeal is dismissed but it does
             seem  that  the  appellant  is  entitled  to  know  that   the
             undisputed elements of his Article 8 claim have in  fact  been
             considered."

11. The submissions made to this Tribunal by Mr Hoshi, who then represented
    the appellant, consisted of four points.  The first was that the  judge
    had been wrong in his application of the well-known case of Devaseelan.
     At paragraph 4 of his decision, Judge Fowell stated as follows:

         "4.  His situation now calls for reconsideration.   The  principles
             to be applied in such cases are as set out in [the] well-known
             decision  in  Devaseelan  [2002]  UKIAT  00702.    The   first
             Tribunal's determination [that is the decision of Judge  Bart-
             Stewart] stands as an assessment of the  claim  the  appellant
             was making at the time of the first determination; it  is  not
             binding on the second Tribunal but, there  again,  the  second
             Tribunal is not hearing  an  appeal  against  it.   The  first
             decision is always the starting point; facts  since  then  can
             always be considered; facts before then but  not  relevant  to
             the first  decision  can  always  be  considered;  the  second
             Tribunal should treat with circumspection relevant facts  that
             had not been brought to the  first  Tribunal's  attention;  if
             issues and evidence  on  the  first  and  second  appeals  are
             materially the same, the  second  Tribunal  should  treat  the
             issues as settled by the first decision rather  than  allowing
             the matter to be relitigated."

12. Judge Fowell then went on at paragraph 5 to state that this was "not  a
    case ... in which there is any particular dispute over the facts".  The
    only "principal difference" that he noted since the  previous  occasion
    was that the appellant had now commenced a relationship with a  British
    citizen.

13. Mr Hoshi submitted that Devaseelan had no relevance to a case where the
    only previous decision was a decision which had been set aside  and  on
    behalf  of  the  respondent,  Mr  Jarvis  [who  then  represented   the
    respondent] did not seek to suggest otherwise, although he  did  submit
    that this approach did not have a material bearing on the decision.   I
    agreed  that  although  the  reference  to  principles  established  in
    Devaseelan was unfortunate, it did not really have any relevance to the
    hearing.

14. Mr Hoshi's second submission on behalf of the appellant  was  that  the
    judge had failed to give any or any  adequate  weight  to  the  service
    record of the appellant in the balancing exercise which was  necessary.
    This was coupled with his third point which  was  that  the  judge  had
    failed to take into account  material  evidence  being  that  of  Major
    Buchannan, who had given evidence as to the  appellant's  army  service
    and how he had been an exemplary soldier.   He  also  referred  to  the
    public interest in not wasting the resources which had  been  spent  on
    his training.

15. With regard to these points, Mr Jarvis on behalf of the respondent  had
    submitted that very little weight could now be given  to  this  because
    the Rules set out the circumstances in which a person who had served in
    the Armed Forces should be entitled to remain and the appellant did not
    meet the Rules.  So far as Major Buchannan's evidence was concerned, it
    was not for him to set out what the policy ought to be with  regard  to
    money which this country had spent on training  members  of  the  Armed
    Forces.  That was a matter for the government and  not  for  a  serving
    army officer.

16. Mr Hoshi submitted that Judge Fowell had relied far too strongly on the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803 to  the
    effect that there was a public interest in students returning to  their
    home countries at the end of their studies (at  paragraph  19)  because
    this case was not the same (contrary to what the  judge  had  found  at
    paragraph 45) and was  certainly  not  based  on  similar  facts.   The
    difference in this case was that this appellant it was said had amongst
    other factors been an exemplary soldier while he  was  able  to  be  so
    which was a factor which he was entitled to have properly considered by
    the judge.

17. Mr Hoshi had a difficulty with this argument because  at  paragraph  47
    Judge Fowell  had  said  in  terms  that  "I  take  into  account  [the
    appellant's] military service, including the tour of duty in Cyprus and
    his willingness to deploy to Afghanistan" but had gone on to  say  that
    "These are important considerations, and clearly  carried  considerable
    weight with the judge on the last occasion in the First-tier Tribunal".



18. The judge had however gone on to say that:

         "Nevertheless this has to  be  set  against  the  important  public
         interest, also stressed in Rhuppiah,  for  students  to  return  to
         their home country on completion of their  studies,  having  gained
         the skills and experiences for which they first came."

    The judge then found that "The military factor in this case  cannot  in
    my view make a  decisive  difference  where  the  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules are otherwise so far from met."

19. Mr Hoshi submitted that  throughout  the  decision  the  appellant  was
    regarded as being someone who was attempting to remain after the end of
    his studies, whereas in fact he had continued to remain in this country
    lawfully and indeed with an exemption from immigration control for some
    period after those studies were at an end, so this was  not  a  typical
    student case.  Regardless of the judge stating that he had  given  full
    account of the appellant's military service it was clear  that  he  had
    not done so.  Also if one considered the statement that this "important
    consideration" had "clearly carried considerable weight with the  judge
    on the last occasion in the First-tier Tribunal",  the  judge  did  not
    make it clear at all whether or not he had given "considerable  weight"
    to this factor or indeed what weight he had given to  it  at  all.   Mr
    Hoshi submitted that the error was material because  it  was  at  least
    arguable that if appropriate weight, or any weight, had been  given  to
    this factor it would have been sufficient in  the  balancing  exercise,
    having regard to all the other factors (including possibly the  genuine
    relationship now which the appellant had with a  British  citizen  whom
    the judge found could not reasonably be expected to go to Cameroon with
    the appellant), that it would have been possible for the judge to  have
    come to a different conclusion.

20. Mr Hoshi's final  argument  was  that  the  judge  had  an  erroneously
    restricted interpretation  of  precariousness  when  having  regard  to
    paragraph 117B(5) of the 2002 Act.  He submitted that the judge  should
    have considered all the factors before concluding that the  appellant's
    private life had been established while his stay here was  "precarious"
    and in particular that the appellant did not believe it to be so.

21. With regard to that last point, I retain the view I expressed after the
    error of law hearing that there was no merit  in  it  whatsoever.   The
    appellant's position clearly was precarious.  He had leave for most  of
    the period from 2010 to 2015 but it must have been clear to anyone that
    there could be no certainty that even if he behaved  himself  while  he
    was here that leave would be continued, and certainly since 2015 he has
    not had leave at all.  So far as  his  relationship  with  his  current
    partner is concerned, to which detailed reference will be  made  below,
    it is clear that that relationship on any view was  formed  at  a  time
    when the appellant was not in the country lawfully and so by reason  of
    Section  117B(4)  little  weight  can  be  given   to   that   in   the
    proportionality exercise.

22. Having considered all  the  factors  very  carefully  indeed  I  stated
    immediately following the  error  of  law  hearing  that  I  was  "just
    persuaded" that it was not clear from the decision that the  judge  had
    given any  real  weight  to  the  evidence  regarding  the  appellant's
    military service, including the evidence given by  Major  Buchannan  on
    his behalf.  I echoed what  was  said  by  Judge  Coker  when  granting
    permission which was that the appellant was entitled not just  to  know
    that these  undisputed  elements  of  his  Article  8  claim  had  been
    considered, but they were considered as  part  of  the  proportionality
    exercise.  Accordingly, although I considered that the appellant  would
    still have a difficult task to persuade this Tribunal that it would not
    be proportionate in these circumstances for him to return to  Cameroon,
    he was entitled to have all his arguments  considered  and  those  that
    were in his favour must be and must be  seen  to  be  factored  into  a
    decision.

23. I also recorded in this decision (which in light of the evidence  given
    today  and  the  submissions  made  in  particular  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent is of some relevance) that Mr Hoshi then specifically  asked
    me to record that on instructions from the appellant he requested  that
    this Tribunal remake the decision  without  hearing  further  evidence,
    allowing the appellant's appeal.  I noted that on  the  facts  of  this
    case that was not only an inappropriate request but the  fact  that  it
    was made indicated that  the  appellant  did  not  yet  understand  the
    difficulties in his case.

24. Mr Hoshi then made the submission that given the length  of  time  that
    the appellant's appeal had taken, this appeal should now in  any  event
    remain in the Upper Tribunal and be remade here and as already noted  I
    acceded to this submission.

25. Accordingly the hearing was then relisted before me on 2 November  2016
    by which time, following directions I had given, I was  provided  with,
    amongst other evidence, a statement from the  appellant's  fianc�e,  Ms
    Nwosu, in which at paragraphs 11 and 12 she had stated as follows:

         "11. In 2014, I suffered a sudden ruptured pulmonary  artery  which
             damaged the upper lobe of my left  lung.   As  a  result,  the
             upper lobe of my left lung had to be  removed  and  the  lower
             lobe does not function at all.  As a result  of  this,  I  was
             critically ill and was hospitalised from November  2014  until
             February 2015.  My doctors have advised that I must stay  away
             from places with a high incidence of illness and infection  as
             I have a greatly reduced immune system and am  susceptible  to
             picking up diseases easily.   I  therefore  cannot  travel  to
             countries where infection and tropical illnesses are  high  as
             this may put my health and  even  my  life  at  risk.   I  can
             therefore only travel for very short times and I have to  take
             extra precautions to avoid problems.

         12.  As a result, it is not possible for me to leave the UK to live
             in a place like Nigeria or  Cameroon  as  this  would  put  my
             health at immediate risk.  I continue to be monitored  by  the
             Respiratory Team at St George's Hospital twice a year or  more
             depending on my health situation and  I  also  keep  in  close
             contact with my GP."

26. I had regard to the consolidated bundle  which  had  been  prepared  on
    behalf of the appellant but noted that the  medical  evidence  although
    present was briefer than I would have liked.   There  was  a  one  page
    letter  from  Dr  Dunleavy,  Consultant  in  Respiratory  Medicine,  St
    George's Hospital, which confirmed that Ms Nwosu had indeed suffered  a
    massive pulmonary haemorrhage, as was consistent  with  her  statement,
    but the medical evidence did not in turn set out the  advice  which  Ms
    Nwosu claimed in her statement that she had had and nor was  there  any
    evidence adduced at that stage as to what the risk would be were she to
    live in Cameroon.

27. At the outset of the hearing I had indicated to the parties that it was
    the view of this Tribunal that such evidence  might  well  be  critical
    when the Tribunal was to consider whether or not, having regard to EX.1
    of Appendix FM, there would be  insurmountable  obstacles  (as  defined
    within EX.2 as very significant  difficulties)  which  would  make  the
    continuation of family life between the appellant and his fianc�e  very
    difficult in Cameroon.  In these circumstances I invited Mr Halim,  who
    by this stage was representing the appellant, as he has today, to  seek
    instructions from the appellant as to whether he wished the opportunity
    of obtaining further evidence with regard to this issue.

28. Having sought instructions, Mr Halim addressed the Tribunal as  follows
    (and I recorded this submission verbatim and set it out in my  note  of
    hearing which I gave immediately following the hearing  on  2  November
    2016) as follows;

         "Further to matters raised,  we  seek  an  adjournment  because  of
         matters  arising  out  of  the  appellant's   fianc�e's   evidence,
         especially at paragraphs 11 and 12 [of her witness statement].

         She suffered a ruptured pulmonary  artery  which  has  damaged  the
         upper lobe of her left lung.

         This has had to be removed and the consequence is  that  the  lower
         lobe does not function at all.

         This caused the appellant's fianc�e to become critically ill and be
         hospitalised for four months between November 2014 to February 2015
         and the consequent medical advice provided to her is that she  must
         stay away from any foreign area with a high  incidence  of  illness
         and infection.  This is because she has a greatly diminished immune
         system, which means she  is  susceptible  to  picking  up  diseases
         easily (especially with infection with tropical diseases).

         That raises the very important question so far as EX.1 of  Appendix
         FM of the Immigration Rules is concerned as to whether or not there
         is an exception in this case and the appellant's  fianc�e's  health
         could  create   very   significant   obstacles   preventing   their
         integration into Cameroon.

         As things stand, there is no objective or expert evidence to assist
         the Tribunal as to what is plainly a highly material consideration.



         Given the long procedural history in this case and in the interests
         of justice, we respectfully submit that the prudent course to  take
         would be to seek a short adjournment in order to obtain a  discrete
         and focused evidence on this particular point.

         In light of the history of this case, it will benefit  all  parties
         to have all matters fully resolved and for these reasons  we  would
         seek an adjournment."

29. On behalf of the respondent Mr Bramble accepted that it would  be  fair
    to allow such an adjournment and that the respondent would not seek  to
    argue  that  this  was  technically  a  "new"  matter;  there   was   a
    relationship already in play and what the Tribunal would be  doing  was
    looking to factors within the Article 8 ambit which were either  within
    or outside the Rules.  If and to the extent that this could be regarded
    as a new matter, the respondent would have plenty of time  to  consider
    it before the resumed hearing.

30. Accordingly I gave directions at that hearing.  The appeal  was  to  be
    adjourned to today's date, and the appellant was  given  permission  to
    file further evidence so long as this  evidence  was  lodged  with  the
    Tribunal and served on the  respondent  by  no  later  than  Friday  30
    November 2018.  In terms I stated as follows:

         "...

         (3)  This evidence should be directed to the issue of the extent of
             any health risks there would be if the appellant's fianc�e, Ms
             Nwosu, was to live in  Cameroon,  with  particular  regard  to
             paragraphs 11  and  12  of  her  witness  statement  dated  19
             September 2018 [referred to above] ...

         (4)  I record that  these  directions  were  given  orally  to  the
             parties immediately following the hearing and have been  noted
             by the parties, and  take  effect  regardless  of  when  these
             directions are communicated in writing to the parties."

31. Unfortunately, there was a small delay in the service of  this  further
    evidence because although dated 28 November 2018 it appears that it was
    not sent to the respondent until 3 December of this year by first class
    post.  Also, unfortunately, it was sent to the wrong  address,  because
    it was sent to the Presenting Officers' Unit rather than the Specialist
    Appeals Team to which in fact it should have been sent.   Whatever  the
    reason the unfortunate consequence was that Mr Lindsay,  who  has  been
    representing the respondent at the hearing before this Tribunal  today,
    did not have sight of the supplementary bundle which had been  produced
    until today and accordingly had the respondent wished  to  put  in  any
    evidence in response, he was not able to do so, because he had not  had
    advanced notice of this evidence.

32. A minor difficulty arose within the hearing because as a result  of  Mr
    Lindsay not having had an opportunity to read the  evidence  in  detail
    before the hearing, he had initially chosen not to ask any questions of
    the appellant's cousin, Mr Ogu, but that statement  had  contained  one
    matter which on reflection Mr  Lindsay  on  behalf  of  the  respondent
    wished to challenge.  However, that was  dealt  with  by  the  Tribunal
    permitting Mr Lindsay to change his mind and cross-examine  Mr  Ogu  on
    the particular point in issue, to which reference will be made below.

33. Although Mr Lindsay in his  closing  submissions  submitted  that  less
    weight  should  be  given  to  the  material   contained   within   the
    supplementary bundle because the respondent had not had an  opportunity
    of considering this earlier and that the respondent had been prejudiced
    as a result, the Tribunal indicated to Mr Lindsay that if he considered
    that there was any prejudice to the  respondent  because  of  the  late
    service of this bundle, the Tribunal  would  grant  an  adjournment  in
    order to enable the respondent to consider whether or not he wished  to
    either  submit  further  evidence  to  counter  such  evidence  as  was
    contained within this bundle or to  consider  further  any  submissions
    which the respondent  might  wish  to  make  regarding  this  evidence.
    However, the Tribunal also made it clear to  Mr  Lindsay  that  in  the
    event that he did not seek an adjournment, it would  be  on  the  basis
    that the Tribunal would not consider there to have been  any  prejudice
    to the respondent, because the respondent would not thereby  have  been
    deprived of an opportunity of considering  this  material  further  but
    would have chosen to go ahead in any event.

34. Having considered this further, Mr Lindsay informed the  Tribunal  that
    he did not seek a  further  adjournment  and  the  hearing  accordingly
    proceeded on the basis  of  the  evidence  which  was  now  before  the
    Tribunal.



The Hearing on 10 December 2018

35. Accordingly, in addition  to  the  original  consolidated  bundle,  the
    Tribunal now had the benefit of the supplementary bundle which had been
    prepared on behalf of the appellant.  This included a witness statement
    from Mr Ogu, the appellant's cousin, and Mr Anyanwu, a  friend  of  the
    appellant whom the appellant had known through their joint  service  in
    the Armed Forces.  As already indicated Mr Ogu was cross-examined.

36. Both the  appellant  and  Ms  Nwosu  gave  evidence  and  affirmed  the
    statements they had previously made.  Both were cross-examined.

37. In cross-examination, the appellant was asked first  whether  he  could
    recall when was the last time that Ms Nwosu had travelled to Africa  to
    which he had originally stated that although he could  not  recall  the
    dates, briefly, he thought it was "last year I think  for  a  wedding".
    He continued that she had "stayed for a couple of days  and  came  back
    because she can't stay too long".  He said that this had been  a  visit
    to Nigeria.

38. He was then asked whether he was sure that it was "only for a couple of
    days", to which he replied "yes.  Roughly about seven days".

39. The appellant continued by saying it  was  "definitely  not  more  than
    seven days" and then he added "I am sorry, it was  not  last  year  but
    earlier this year" but he could not remember the month.

40. He was then asked as to the current status of his relationship with  Ms
    Nwosu to which he said that at the moment they were engaged,  and  when
    asked when they had become engaged, he replied "February 2017".   As  a
    matter of record, in  both  the  appellant's  and  Ms  Nwosu's  written
    witness statements, the date had been given as February 2018.

41. The appellant was then asked whether "since becoming engaged" there had
    been any other occasions when Ms Nwosu had travelled to Africa to which
    the appellant had replied that there had just been the one.  In  answer
    to a question from the Tribunal as to whether  the  Tribunal  could  be
    clear that the appellant was saying that after they  had  been  engaged
    (which at this stage the Tribunal understood the appellant to be saying
    had been February 2017) Ms Nwosu had not travelled to Africa other than
    the one occasion, for no more than seven days,  the  appellant  replied
    that that was correct.

42. The appellant was then asked whether when Ms  Nwosu  had  travelled  to
    Nigeria this year she had been able to take some medication to  prevent
    her from being sick while she was  away  to  which  the  appellant  had
    replied that "she is very cautious of her environment and who she mixes
    with, because she is very susceptible to picking up  infection.   Every
    day she picks up phlegm and that puts her in a vulnerable position".

43. He was then asked whether to his knowledge she would take medication to
    stop her being sick in Nigeria to which he  replied  that  "she  is  on
    vitamins, to the best of my knowledge".  This Tribunal did  not  record
    any more detailed answer than this and the appellant was not asked  any
    more detailed questions as to precisely what medication  he  understood
    Ms Nwosu to be taking.  There was no other cross-examination.

44. Ms Nwosu then gave evidence, and again as the appellant had  done,  she
    affirmed that her earlier  witness  statement  had  been  truthful  and
    accurate.  She confirmed that she had  suffered  a  ruptured  pulmonary
    artery so that her left lung did not work and that she had been advised
    to stay away from places where there was a lot of  illness  because  of
    reduced immunity.  She said that the effect of  the  rupture  was  that
    part of her left lung had been taken out.  Originally the hospital  had
    thought that the lower lobe would get better but it had not done so yet
    and because it was left there she  had  sputum  phlegm.   The  hospital
    liked to monitor this every so often to see if there was any  infection
    which would compromise her immune system internally, as she was  liable
    to get ill.  She described her condition as being like "a second  class
    citizen" because her immune system did not work.  She regularly had  x-
    rays and blood tests and the doctors preferred to use MRI scans because
    these were less damaging.

45. In cross-examination Ms Nwosu was asked if she had  her  passport  with
    her.  By chance (because this had not been  pre-planned)  she  had  her
    British passport with her because  she  had  been  to  see  Reeds,  the
    employment agency, recently and had needed her passport and so  it  was
    still in her handbag.  However, she confirmed  that  she  still  had  a
    Nigerian passport and that when she went to Nigeria she needed to  show
    both passports.  There were stamps in her passport for Turkey  and  the
    USA, but she had used  her  Nigerian  passport  when  she  had  visited
    Nigeria.

46. In evidence she said that she had indeed been to Nigeria this year  for
    seven days (she had not been present in the Tribunal when the appellant
    had given his evidence).  She showed the court on her mobile phone  the
    communication from a travel agent which confirmed  that  she  had  left
    London on 22 April 2018 and had returned a week later on 29 April 2018.
     This was consistent with that part of the appellant's evidence to  the
    effect that she had been to Nigeria for seven days this year.  She  was
    however also asked whether she had had any other visit  to  Africa  and
    what was the last time before then that she had travelled to which  she
    replied that she thought it was in March last year (that is 2017)  when
    she had gone to Nigeria for about 60 days.

47. Ms Nwosu was asked when she had become  engaged  to  the  appellant  to
    which she replied (consistently with what was contained in her  witness
    statement, and also the witness statement of the appellant, but not  as
    already indicated with the appellant's oral evidence) that  it  was  in
    February this year.  It was accordingly put to her that  the  appellant
    had given evidence that they had become engaged in February  last  year
    and had made only one trip since then and was asked whether  she  could
    explain why the appellant had not been aware of her trip last year,  to
    which Ms Nwosu replied simply that she could not.

48. She confirmed that she had attended the appellant's hearing before  the
    Tribunal in February of this year and was asked  if  she  could  recall
    when in February (this year) she and the appellant had become  engaged,
    to which she said that it was at the start of the  month,  just  before
    Valentine's Day.  She was referred to paragraph 32 of the  decision  of
    Judge Fowell  (at  the  hearing  which  had  in  fact  taken  place  on
    Valentine's Day this year) where Judge Fowell had  stated  as  follows,
    regarding the relationship between the appellant and Ms Nwosu:

         "To recite the obvious points, the couple are not  living  together
         and have no children.  There has been no formal engagement."

49. Given that the evidence of Ms Nwosu was that  the  couple  have  become
    engaged prior to this hearing Mr Lindsay asked  how  it  was  that  the
    judge had stated this, whereas in fact she was  saying  that  they  had
    been engaged before the hearing.  Ms Nwosu replied that  the  appellant
    had not thought that this  was  relevant.   It  had  not  been  in  the
    statement because the appellant had not thought it was necessary.

50. Ms Nwosu was then asked about what medication she was  given  when  she
    travelled abroad to stop her getting sick on those occasions, to  which
    she replied that she was given some medication but she  could  not  say
    what the name was because she got it from the nurse when she travelled.
     She was asked whether it was a medicine and not a  vitamin,  to  which
    she replied that it was a medicine and not a vitamin.  She was asked in
    terms whether the appellant would know that this was something she took
    when she travelled, to which Ms Nwosu replied that the appellant should
    know.

51. In re-examination Ms Nwosu said that the medicine she took was "to stop
    me from being sick".  However, it had very strong side effects  so  she
    did not take it for long.  It made her get very hot.  Her body got very
    sensitive, particularly when she was in the sun and she  did  not  take
    these drugs except when she travelled.

52. The Tribunal was concerned that even though there was an  inconsistency
    between what the appellant had said in evidence (that is  that  he  had
    got engaged in February 2017 whereas in his statement he had said  this
    was the year later) this had not been put to him  in  cross-examination
    and so I recalled the appellant to allow Mr Lindsay the opportunity  of
    cross-examining him further.  He was asked  if  he  could  explain  the
    discrepancy between the dates he gave, to which the  appellant  replied
    that this had been a mistake on his part.  He  originally  stated  that
    when Mr Lindsay had suggested the  date  he  had  said  "yes"  to  that
    suggestion, at which point the Tribunal referred to the  note  of  that
    evidence from which it was clear  that  Mr  Lindsay  had  not  in  fact
    suggested a date but had asked what the date was and it was  in  answer
    to that question that the appellant had replied "February  2017".   The
    appellant then added that he had been  through  a  lot  of  stress  and
    trauma over this case and he got lost in it.  It  was  a  mistake.   He
    also asked the Tribunal to remember that he had made  a  mistake  about
    the dates on which Ms Nwosu had travelled as  well,  but  that  he  had
    corrected the initial evidence he had  given  on  that  point  (he  had
    originally said that he believed she had gone to Nigeria for seven days
    in 2017 but then corrected that evidence to say that it was this year).



53. At this point Mr Lindsay put on behalf of the respondent  that  it  was
    now the respondent's position that "you are not really engaged, but are
    just making it up to help your case".  This is of course the first time
    in which the respondent had sought to suggest  that  that  relationship
    between the appellant and Ms Nwosu was  anything  other  than  genuine.
    The appellant replied to this as follows:

         "This was never disputed.  I did not want to get  her  involved  in
         this.  I did not want her to get involved at  all.   The  case  was
         about my military service.  It happened  that  it  became  relevant
         when we were in court.  I did not want to use her  status  to  help
         me.  I have always been confident that I have served this  country.
         That was the reason I have been confident."

54. The appellant then continued that this had gone out of his  mind.   His
    relationship with Ms Nwosu had only become very strong  in  the  latter
    part of 2017 and the early part of 2018.  There were some things  about
    her at the earlier time that he had not known and the relationship  had
    only become strong in the later part of 2018.

55. The appellant was then asked why it was that he had asked  whether  why
    it was that he had said that she had only been out of the country  once
    since they had become engaged in February 2017 to which  the  appellant
    merely repeated his original answer to this.  It is of course the  case
    that the question had actually been how often  Ms  Nwosu  had  gone  to
    Africa since the couple have been engaged, and as a matter of fact that
    was only once, although if the  question  was  as  it  appeared  to  be
    understood as to how often she had  left  the  country  after  February
    2017, she had also been on another occasion.  It is also the case  that
    Ms Nwosu's evidence that she had visited Nigeria for some two months in
    March 2017 was inconsistent or appeared possibly inconsistent with  the
    evidence of the appellant and Mr Nwosu that the relationship had  begun
    in February or March 2017, because at that time she was in Nigeria.

56. As indicated earlier, there was one aspect of Mr Ogu's  evidence  which
    was contrary to the case which Mr Lindsay now was putting on behalf  of
    the respondent, and that is contained at paragraph  2  of  his  witness
    statement which is contained in the supplementary bundle.  At paragraph
    2 Mr Ogu states as follows:

         "2.  I write to confirm that [the appellant] is my cousin  and  has
             been my house mate for the last three years.  I  confirm  that
             during this period, his partner Onyi [Ms Nwosu] has  moved  in
             with us for most of the week and I can confirm that they enjoy
             a close and loving relationship.  I have known and look up  to
             him for most of my adult life and he has been of great support
             to me both morally and academically."

57. In cross-examination, Mr Lindsay asked whether or not Mr Ogu knew  when
    the couple had become engaged, to which Mr Ogu replied that he did  not
    know when, and he could not even remember which year.  Mr  Lindsay  put
    to him in terms that it was the respondent's  position,  "having  heard
    the evidence" that they are not in a  real  relationship  at  all,  and
    invited Mr Ogu to comment with regard to this position.  Having thought
    about this, Mr Ogu replied simply that this suggestion was "ludicrous".
     The couple had been together for a while and the suggestion now  being
    advanced on behalf of the respondent "doesn't make any sense".



Submissions

58. On behalf of the respondent Mr Lindsay's primary  submission  was  that
    none of the  witnesses  were  credible.   So  far  as  the  appellant's
    credibility was concerned, the Tribunal was "aware that  the  appellant
    had received the warning to tell the truth".  I indicated that that was
    putting a gloss on the Tribunal's opening  remarks  to  the  appellant,
    before he gave evidence, which had not been  intended.   The  appellant
    had been advised by the Tribunal at the  outset  that  like  any  other
    witness it was important that he thought carefully about the answers he
    gave and if he  found  he  had  any  difficulty  in  understanding  the
    questions, he should reflect before answering, because it was important
    that the appellant gave his evidence effectively and  truthfully.   The
    Tribunal would not describe this as a "warning".

59. Mr Lindsay then referred as an inconsistency to  the  appellant  having
    said "several times" that his "claimed partner" (that is Ms Nwosu)  had
    travelled to Nigeria for only  a  "couple  of  days",  whereas  it  had
    transpired that that was not truthful, because in response to continued
    questioning he had changed it to "one week".

60. Mr Lindsay also asked the Tribunal to note that he had had to object at
    one time because the appellant had been "coaching  the  witness"  while
    she was giving her evidence, in that he had been indicating to her  the
    answer that she should give, and this did not  rebound  to  his  credit
    either.

61. The Tribunal should note that Ms Nwosu had stated  that  the  appellant
    knew that when she travelled overseas she took medication which was not
    vitamins which stopped her getting sick.  In contrast, the  appellant's
    evidence was that she only took vitamins, which was  inconsistent  with
    Ms Nwosu's evidence that he was aware that she took other medication.

62. It  is  sensible  for  the  Tribunal  to  deal  with  these  particular
    submissions at this stage.  Although it is  right  that  the  appellant
    initially used the phrase a "couple of days" to describe the length  of
    time that Ms Nwosu had visited Nigeria originally last  year  but  then
    after correction, which had not been in response to  cross-examination,
    he said had been this year, when he was asked to define what  he  meant
    by a "couple of days" he had stated quite openly that  this  was  about
    seven days, which in the event was consistent with what  Ms  Nwosu  had
    told the Tribunal.  I do not consider realistically that  this  was  an
    inconsistency in his evidence.

63. With regard to the suggestion that the appellant had been "coaching" Ms
    Nwosu, it is right to record that Mr Lindsay did raise an objection  to
    the appellant trying to indicate to Ms Nwosu what her answer  ought  to
    be, although neither  the  Tribunal  nor  Mr  Halim  actually  saw  it.
    However, I have no reason to doubt that  Mr  Lindsay  clearly  believed
    that this is what happened and it may very well have been the case that
    at part of the evidence when Ms  Nwosu  could  not  remember  what  had
    happened on a particular  occasion  the  appellant  was  attempting  to
    remind her of what he believed had  happened.   The  Tribunal  at  this
    stage pointed out to the appellant that this  was  not  appropriate  if
    that is what he had been doing because it was important that  Ms  Nwosu
    gave whatever her recollection was without any  reminders  from  anyone
    else but in the judgment of this Tribunal that is very far removed from
    a case where an appellant is deliberately coaching a  witness.   It  is
    very common indeed in cases such as this  where  a  genuine  couple  is
    giving evidence and one of them cannot remember what occurred  for  the
    other party in that couple to seek to remind their partner of what  the
    position was, not appreciating precisely what the rules are with regard
    to such evidence.  I certainly did not draw the  conclusion  that  this
    was in any way  deliberate  improper  behaviour  on  the  part  of  the
    appellant.

64. Similarly, with regard to the evidence regarding the medication that Ms
    Nwosu takes, she did not know herself what it was, and the highest that
    the appellant could be said to have put his evidence was  that  he  was
    not aware of medication other than vitamins.  He certainly did not  say
    at all that she did not take any medication other  than  vitamins,  and
    again I do not consider there is anything in this point either.

65. Mr Lindsay then referred to the discrepancy between when the  appellant
    had said in oral evidence that the couple had got engaged and what  was
    said in the witness statement and also asked the Tribunal to note which
    the Tribunal does that the evidence in the witness statement that  they
    had  started  their  relationship  in  February  or  March   2017   was
    inconsistent with the evidence which Ms Nwosu had given to the Tribunal
    that in March 2017 she had gone to Nigeria for 60  days.   It  was  the
    respondent's submission that clearly the relationship had  not  started
    on that date.

66. That may be correct, but the Tribunal does  not  accept  the  inference
    which Mr Lindsay invited the Tribunal to take from this which was  that
    it was "clear that all the witnesses  have  come  here  to  lie".   The
    primary submission which Mr Lindsay then made was that given the  clear
    credibility issues the appellant had not established on the balance  of
    probabilities that he was in a genuine relationship.   So  far  as  the
    third witness was concerned, Mr Ogu, he had not even known in what year
    the relationship had begun.

67. Mr Lindsay also asked the Tribunal to accept that the evidence given by
    the appellant that he was not aware that his relationship would  be  an
    important factor in this appeal hearing was not credible  because  this
    is something that he must have been advised about by his previous legal
    advisors.

68. With regard to this point, I refer back to the observations that I made
    immediately following the error of law hearing when I indicated that it
    was quite clear from the submission which the  appellant  had  insisted
    that Mr Hoshi make on his behalf, which was to invite the  Tribunal  to
    proceed to remake the decision without  further  hearing  allowing  the
    appeal, that the appellant clearly had no real  understanding  of  what
    the legal issues were in this case.  I also take account  of  the  fact
    that it was not until Ms Nwosu made her subsequent statement  prior  to
    the hearing which had been due to take place on 2  November  this  year
    that it was clear that the issue of  whether  or  not  there  would  be
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  in  Cameroon,  such
    that EX.1 would apply, became an issue.

69. I also have in  mind  with  regard  to  the  suggestion  that  all  the
    witnesses, that is the appellant, Ms Nwosu and the  appellant's  cousin
    Mr Ogu, are deliberately lying, that this evidence has remained on  all
    the main parts consistent throughout the various  hearings  there  have
    been in this appeal.  Ms Nwosu has no reason so far as this Tribunal is
    aware as to why she should support the appellant throughout  all  these
    hearings if indeed she is not in a relationship with  him  as  claimed.
    Her evidence has been entirely consistent and although on some  matters
    the appellant's evidence has been inconsistent, hers has not and Mr Ogu
    does not pretend to know precisely when they became engaged, but I  see
    no reason to doubt his honesty when he told the court when  asked  that
    in his opinion the respondent's present  position,  that  everyone  had
    come to court to lie, was "ludicrous" and made no sense at all.  I have
    no hesitation at all in finding on the basis of  the  evidence  I  have
    heard to the standard of proof  necessary,  which  is  the  balance  of
    probabilities, that the relationship between the appellant and Ms Nwosu
    is an entirely genuine one and is subsisting and that  they  intend  to
    marry.  The position that they are in at the moment is that  everything
    is on hold pending the resolution one way or the other of this  appeal.



70. The next submission made on behalf of the respondent by Mr  Lindsay  is
    that in the  alternative,  even  if  the  appellant  and  his  "claimed
    partner" are in a relationship, it had not been established  that  this
    relationship was sufficiently durable such that they could properly  be
    said to be "partners".  Put at its highest, they were "going out".

71. Again I reject  this  submission.   I  am  entirely  satisfied  to  the
    standard of proof necessary that the appellant and Ms Nwosu are engaged
    as claimed and they are in a durable permanent relationship.

72. So far as the overall Article 8  claim  (leaving  aside  EX.1  for  the
    moment) is concerned the respondent  relies  on  the  decision  of  the
    Supreme Court in Rhuppiah, and he maintains  that  the  appellant  must
    have expected throughout his time here that he would  have  to  return.
    Although there is  supporting  evidence  of  the  appellant's  military
    service in this country, which deserves respect, this was not  a  legal
    basis on which this appeal was capable of succeeding.  The  Immigration
    Rules set out the circumstances in which a person serving in the forces
    should be entitled to remain.  The appellant does not meet those  Rules
    which is a matter to be weighed in the balance.  Furthermore, not  only
    was the appellant's position in this country precarious throughout  his
    time here but it has also been unlawful since 2005.  On that basis  all
    of his private life accrued in the UK would have  little  weight  under
    Section  117B(4)  and  (5)  of  the  2002  Act,  and  furthermore,  his
    relationship with Ms  Nwosu  will  have  little  weight  under  117B(5)
    because it accrued whilst he was in this country unlawfully.

73. It is quite clear, as I indicated in the error of law decision  that  I
    gave,  that  throughout  his  time  in  this  country  the  appellant's
    immigration position has been precarious and it is also correct that he
    was here unlawfully certainly since 2015, but these are matters which I
    will consider below.

74. So far as EX.1 is in issue, which would only arise if the Tribunal  was
    against him on his  primary  or  alternative  submissions,  Mr  Lindsay
    submitted that the question was whether or not the appellant,  together
    with Ms Nwosu, could relocate to Cameroon.  His first position on  that
    was the evidence was not served in accordance with the directions but I
    have already dealt with that matter above, and having not  applied  for
    an adjournment, Mr Lindsay, as I made clear to him during the evidence,
    has to deal with the evidence as it is now before the Tribunal.

75. Mr Lindsay reminded the Tribunal that the evidence was  that  Ms  Nwosu
    had been able to  travel  to  countries  including  and  in  particular
    Nigeria for longer than a very brief period of time.  In particular she
    had gone to Nigeria for a period of some two months in March  2017  and
    thereabouts; the Tribunal  has  heard  evidence  that  she  could  take
    medicine to supress her symptoms and there was no evidence  other  than
    anecdotal from  Ms  Nwosu  that  this  medicine  had  significant  side
    effects.  In any event there were not significant difficulties  to  her
    relocating within Cameroon.

76. I then heard detailed submissions on behalf of the  appellant  from  Mr
    Halim.  He dealt first of all with the Article 8 claim in general.  The
    appellant's case was that the Tribunal would have to look  through  the
    lens of the Rules but should conduct its own assessment.  The  Tribunal
    must still ask itself the five questions in Razgar and the Section 117B
    factors were not exhaustive.  So the Tribunal would have to  take  into
    account additional factors so long as they were relevant and so long as
    they bore on public interest considerations.  We  get  assistance  from
    statute and common law also.

77. So far as issues with credibility were concerned, Mr  Halim  then  made
    submissions with regard to these issues.  I have already indicated that
    so far as the issue of whether or not there is a  genuine  relationship
    between the parties is concerned I am entirely satisfied that there is,
    and so I do not need to deal with that  issue  in  this  context.   One
    issue which is however or may become significant is that the  appellant
    "missed" the 60 day trip which Ms Nwosu made to  Nigeria.   It  matters
    not for these purposes whether or not the appellant was motivated by  a
    desire to ignore a factor which might suggest that Ms Nwosu was in fact
    capable of visiting Africa for longer than was  originally  thought  or
    not; the issue that this Tribunal would have  to  consider  is  whether
    that is indicative of her ability to  remain  in  Cameroon  permanently
    without undue hardship which is the issue to  which  I  shall  have  to
    return in due course.

78. I deal now before turning to EX.1 with the Article 8 claim in  general.
    In the judgment of this Tribunal absent EX.1 the appeal cannot  succeed
    on this basis.  In light of my findings as to the genuine  relationship
    between the couple, assuming that Ms  Nwosu  were  to  remain  in  this
    country, there would be an interference with the appellant's Article  8
    rights  which  are  sufficiently  large  to  engage  Article  8.   That
    interference is however clearly lawful because  it  would  be  for  the
    purposes of maintaining effective  immigration  control  and  the  real
    issue which the Tribunal would have to consider is whether or not it is
    proportionate.  Even giving full  account  to  the  evidence  of  Major
    Buchannan and the other evidence and allowing that the appellant is not
    a bad immigration offender albeit  that  he  has  remained  since  2015
    without leave, nonetheless he does not  qualify  for  leave  to  remain
    under the Rules and nor is  there  anything  so  compelling  about  his
    circumstances as could exceptionally outweigh the large public interest
    in enforcing those Rules.  As is clear from Section 117B(4) and (5)  as
    already referred to above, only little weight can be  given  either  to
    the appellant's private life or to his family life with his partner for
    the purposes of the Immigration  Rules  in  general,  when  considering
    whether exceptionally leave should be given outside the Rules, and such
    little weight as can be given is not sufficient to outweigh  the  large
    public  interest  in   maintaining   effective   immigration   control.
    Accordingly, this appeal stands or falls on whether or not  EX.1  could
    be said to apply.

79. With this in mind, Mr Halim referred the Tribunal to the evidence  with
    regard to  Cameroon  and  also  with  regard  to  the  precise  medical
    difficulties from which Ms Nwosu was suffering.

80. The  medical  evidence  appears  clear.   Ms  Nwosu  suffered  a  major
    haemorrhage of her left lung as a result of which she has  effectively,
    certainly at the moment, lost the use of one of  her  lungs.   Although
    she retains part of that lung, that part which remains is not effective
    which causes her to cough up phlegm.  The effect on  her  is  that  her
    immune system is damaged and she is at risk if she goes anywhere for  a
    long period of time where she is at increased risk  if  contracting  an
    illness and this risk is increased yet further if the medical treatment
    she is likely to receive would be inadequate.

81. Currently she gets, as she is entitled as a British citizen,  excellent
    treatment on  the  National  Health  Service  where  her  condition  is
    monitored regularly and if anything goes wrong with her lungs,  it  can
    be put right.  The Tribunal accordingly has to look at the situation in
    Cameroon and determine whether  realistically,  having  regard  to  the
    precise wording set out within EX.1 of Appendix FM of  the  Rules,  she
    could be expected to go and  spend  the  rest  of  her  life  with  the
    appellant in Cameroon.

82. I must have in mind throughout this decision  precisely  what  is  said
    within EX.1, which  applies  to  this  appellant,  because  it  is  not
    suggested that he does not meet the suitability  requirements  set  out
    within the Rules.

83. The relevant parts of Section EX of Appendix FM provide as follows:

         "Section EX, exceptions to  certain  eligibility  requirements  for
         leave to remain as a partner or parent

         EX.1.    This paragraph applies if

                ...

                (b)     the  applicant  has   a   genuine   and   subsisting
                    relationship with a partner who is in the UK  and  is  a
                    British  Citizen  ...  and  there   are   insurmountable
                    obstacles to family life with  that  partner  continuing
                    outside the UK.

         EX.2.    For the purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  'insurmountable
                obstacles' means the  very  significant  difficulties  which
                would  be  faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner  in
                continuing their family life together  outside  the  UK  and
                which could not be overcome or  would  entail  very  serious
                hardship for the applicant or their partner."

84. I have already found  that  the  applicant  does  have  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with Ms Nwosu, and she is in the UK  and  is  a
    British citizen, and accordingly the question that has to  be  answered
    is whether or not there would be "insurmountable obstacles"  to  family
    life continuing within Cameroon for which  purpose  the  definition  of
    EX.2  must  apply  which  is  whether  or  not  there  would  be  "very
    significant difficulties" which would be faced by Ms Nwosu "which could
    not be overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious  hardship"  for  her.
    Against this background and definition, I  now  turn  to  the  evidence
    relied upon by the appellant.

85. Mr Halim relies first of all upon the diagnosis which  is  set  out  at
    page 14 of the supplementary bundle, to  which  reference  has  already
    been made above, in which Dr Dunleavy, in her letter  of  October  2016
    had said that:

         "I believe that it is important at this point given the severity of
         this lady's illness and given the  left  upper  lobectomy  and  the
         damage to the rest of her left lung, that we should continue ... to
         follow up at present."

86. This is now supported by evidence from a doctor in Cameroon which is as
    follows:

         "Since her situation makes her more  vulnerable  to  any  slightest
         infection, she requires a regular and perfect medical monitoring to
         guard against any unpredictable health hazard that may occur due to
         her medical history.

         In case she gets  sick,  here  in  Cameroon,  I  definitely  cannot
         guarantee  she  will  have  the  best  possible  care  and  medical
         attention due to a lack of proper medical facilities and  expertise
         to contain her situation during her lifetime.

         Most disheartening and [because of] fear of [the] current situation
         of constant ... civil and political unrest, many hospitals here are
         shut down, hospitals are vandalised and many health  workers  [are]
         leaving ... and fleeing the country.

         It is my sincere expertise and professional  opinion  to  recommend
         her to stay in a developed country like UK where decent  facilities
         and expertise will handle and treat any health uncertainties  which
         may occur  without  fear,  emotional,  psychological  and  physical
         disturbances."

87. This is perhaps not the most  detailed  medical  advice  which  can  be
    given, but in essence what the doctor here is saying is that in generic
    terms the difficulty with obtaining medical treatment  within  Cameroon
    is that the hospitals are in a very poor position which is  exacerbated
    by the political situation within that country.

88. This is supported by the various country guidance information which  is
    also contained within the supplementary bundle.  At paragraph 32 of the
    supplementary bundle for example, there  is  a  report  from  Voice  of
    America News dated 25 November 2018 (that is only two  or  three  weeks
    ago),  which  refers  to  Cameroon  doctors  being  "overwhelmed   with
    patients" from which reference is made to reports "that  medical  staff
    were fleeing hospitals in the tribal  English  speaking  regions  after
    attacks left several nurses dead and others wounded".  On the following
    page an earlier report of 16 August 2017 also  from  Voice  of  America
    News refers to medical staff fleeing from the volatile regions.

89. Then at page 35 there is  reference  to  a  World  Health  Organisation
    Country Cooperation Strategy brief for Cameroon which, in  a  paragraph
    headed "health policies and system", states as follows:

         "The  health  system  still  suffers  from   a   quantitative   and
         qualitative  shortage  of  human  resources,  despite   recruitment
         efforts in recent years; lack of technical and managerial expertise
         and unethical behaviour among personnel; information  deficiencies,
         that would otherwise facilitate improvements in the  management  of
         health  services;  a  weak  legal  framework  for   the   effective
         regulation of pharmaceuticals, which is  essential  to  ensure  the
         availability of quality medical products (including vaccines); lack
         of funds and low absorption of available funds."  (This  was  taken
         from the World Health Organisation (May 2014)  Country  Cooperation
         Strategy - Cameroon.)

90. Effectively it is the appellant's case that  Ms  Nwosu  effectively  is
    susceptible to any illness and more vulnerable to it because of her now
    very weakened immune system and realistically it would not be  sensible
    for her to relocate  to  a  third-world  country  like  Cameroon.   The
    evidence regarding Cameroon paints a bleak picture.  Clearly she  would
    be unlikely to receive the  regular  checks  she  needs  following  the
    massive pulmonary haemorrhage including CT scans, MRI scans,  treatment
    with antibiotics for infection and  a  yearly  flu  vaccine,  also  the
    monitoring of vitamin B deficiencies which would be required to restore
    normal levels of immunity.  The evidence arguably showed that she would
    not in Cameroon receive anything  close  to  the  treatment  she  would
    require and this is exacerbated by political turmoil where  the  health
    services are in conflict with the  armed  militants.   Effectively  the
    appellant's case with regard to Ms Nwosu could be summarised as  saying
    that she does not have a lung and therefore is susceptible to  disease,
    and to go to a country to live forever which has a  volatile  political
    situation and an antiquated health system is simply untenable.

91. In further support of this submission Mr Halim refers to the background
    evidence on Cameroon which is contained  within  the  main  bundle,  in
    addition to the evidence contained within the supplementary bundle.  So
    for example at page 279 of the main bundle there is  reference  to  the
    report from the US State Department 2017  Country  Report  on  Cameroon
    which is dated 20 April 2018, and which begins as follows:

         "Disappearance

         There continued to be reports  of  arrests  and  disappearances  of
         individuals by security forces, particularly in  the  northern  and
         Anglophone regions [and of course it is the  Anglophone  region  to
         which Ms Nwosu and the appellant  would  certainly  go  initially].
         According to nongovernmental organisations, some activists arrested
         in  the  context  of  the  crisis   fuelled   by   perceptions   of
         marginalisation in the northwest and southwest  Anglophone  regions
         could not be accounted for as  of  November.   Family  members  and
         friends of detained persons were frequently unaware of the  missing
         individual's location in detention until after a month or  more  of
         attempting to locate the missing individual."

92. Then at page 281 is an extract from the European  Council  on  Refugees
    and Exiles on Cameroon dated 12 October 2018 (that  is  just  only  two
    months ago) in which it is stated that "the UN has said  the  situation
    is becoming increasingly desperate".

93. Then at page 283 there is an extract from a report of the International
    Crisis Group on Cameroon, dated 3 October 2018,  which  refers  to  the
    dangers in the Anglophone region as follows:

         "The danger of violence around the vote in  Anglophone  regions  is
         high.  But other parts of the country could also be affected,  even
         if the postponement of the parliamentary and municipal elections to
         October 2019, which carried their own danger of localised friction,
         has mitigated some risks.  As election day approaches, tensions are
         growing and the  government  has  become  harder-line,  opting  for
         repression and peddling conspiracy theories in response to  demands
         for social and political reform.  Embryonic movements are  emerging
         across the country, which reject the election.  Some of  them  call
         for a popular insurrection to  unseat  Cameroonian  President  Paul
         Biya.  In the Anglophone  regions  and  parts  of  the  Far  North,
         insecurity may hinder the smooth conduct of the vote."

94. In other words, the position would be that Ms Nwosu, who has a  serious
    medical condition, would have to take her chances in a country where at
    best the health services on offer are antiquated against the background
    of instability so severe as might require her to  move  from  place  to
    place.

95. In my judgment, it would be quite obvious folly for Ms Nwosu now, given
    her current state of health, to move to a  country  where  the  medical
    treatment available to her would at best be patchy and where  it  would
    be made more difficult by the political turmoil which so exists  within
    that country.  This is not an Article 3 case, and this Tribunal is  not
    required to consider merely whether or  not  there  is  some  treatment
    available to her.  The test which has to be applied is  precisely  what
    is stated within EX.1 and EX.2 which is  whether  or  not  obliging  Ms
    Nwosu to go with the appellant to Cameroon (which would be necessary if
    family life was to continue in this country) "would entail very serious
    hardship" for her.  In the judgment of this Tribunal it  would  require
    her to take a risk with her health which a sensible  person  would  not
    lightly take.  Her medical condition is potentially  life  threatening;
    at the moment it is under control in this country.  If she were  to  go
    to Cameroon there is a very real risk first that she would become  ill,
    because absent regular treatment that is much more likely, and secondly
    if she did she would not be able  to  obtain  sufficient  treatment  to
    enable her to deal adequately with that illness.  In  the  judgment  of
    this Tribunal to require her to go to Cameroon now would entail serious
    hardship because it would require her to take  risks  with  her  health
    which she should not be required to take.

96. It follows that EX.1 applies and accordingly for this reason the public
    interest does not require the removal of this appellant.   Absent  this
    requirement, the decision to remove the appellant is a disproportionate
    interference with his article 8 rights.

97. For this reason the appellant's appeal must be allowed and  I  will  so
    order.

                        Date: 27 February 2019
