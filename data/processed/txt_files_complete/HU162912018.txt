                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of Judge Meyler (the judge) of
    the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 16th October 2018.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of  Pakistan  born  7th  January  1986.   He
    entered the UK as a student on 26th June 2009.  His student  leave  was
    extended until 31st May 2011.  Thereafter he had  Tier  1  (Post-Study)
    leave until 19th July 2013.  He then made an application for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) which was refused and his  subsequent
    appeal dismissed.  He became appeal  rights  exhausted  on  11th  March
    2014.  He has had no leave since that date.

 3. On 5th April 2018 he  applied  for  leave  to  remain  based  upon  his
    relationship with his fianc�e [RC] who is a British citizen and to whom
    I shall refer as the Sponsor.

 4. The application was refused by the Respondent on 24th July 2018 and the
    appeal heard by the FtT on 24th September 2018.

 5. The judge found there would be no insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
    life between the Appellant and Sponsor continuing outside the UK.   The
    judge did not accept that the Immigration Rules in relation  to  family
    life and private life could be satisfied.  The judge accepted that  the
    Appellant and Sponsor have a family life, but did not find  that  there
    were any exceptional circumstances which  would  justify  allowing  the
    appeal with reference to Article 8 outside the Immigration  Rules,  and
    concluded  that  the   Respondent's   decision   was   reasonable   and
    proportionate and did  not  breach  Article  8  of  the  1950  European
    Convention.  The appeal was therefore dismissed.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 6. In summary it was contended that the judge  had  erred  in  considering
    EX.1(b) and was wrong to conclude that  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.

 7. It was contended that the judge was wrong in law to  find  that  family
    life did not exist between  the  Sponsor  and  her  parents  and  adult
    siblings as although the Sponsor is an adult, she had never lived apart
    from her parents and siblings.  It was also contended  that  the  judge
    was wrong not to recognise that the Appellant  was  a  member  of  this
    family unit having lived with the family since his arrival in the UK in
    2009.

 8. It was contended that the judge was wrong to conclude that because  the
    Sponsor was training to  be  a  pharmacist,  this  did  not  amount  to
    insurmountable obstacles to her leaving the UK.

 9. It was contended that the judge was wrong  not  to  take  into  account
    previous judicial review proceedings in which two High Court Judges had
    separately indicated that it was "at least arguable"  that  the  appeal
    could succeed before the FtT.

10. It was submitted that the judge was wrong in law not  to  consider  the
    principle in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40.

11. This was on the basis that the Sponsor had been offered employment with
    a salary of �28,050 per year,  which  would  mean  that  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM would be satisfied, and there would  be  no
    point in the Appellant leaving the UK to make an application for  entry
    clearance from abroad.

12. It was also contended that the judge had erred in  considering  section
    117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   It  was
    contended that the relationship between the Appellant and  Sponsor  had
    begun when the Appellant was in the UK lawfully as a student.

Permission to Appeal

13. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Keane of the FtT who found it
    arguable that the judge, concerned with the  application  of  EX.2  had
    arguably not applied the correct test.  It was not clear that the judge
    had born in mind or applied EX.2.  Judge Keane  found  that  the  judge
    arguably should have arrived at findings as to  whether  the  Appellant
    and Sponsor would experience  significant  difficulties  in  continuing
    their family life in Pakistan which could not be  overcome  and  should
    have arrived at findings as to whether the couple would experience very
    serious hardship in Pakistan.

14. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to Rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending in summary that the judge had  considered  the  correct
    test and reached findings which were open to make on the evidence.

My Analysis and Conclusions

15. At the oral hearing Mr Salam relied upon his  skeleton  argument  which
    was in similar terms to the grounds upon which permission to appeal had
    been granted.  It was submitted that the judge had erred by failing  to
    take into account the very significant difficulties  that  the  Sponsor
    would face if she did not complete her pharmacy training.  It was  also
    submitted that the judge had erred by failing to consider the  guidance
    in Chikwamba, and failing to have any regard to  the  findings  of  two
    High Court Judges in previous judicial review proceedings.

16. Mr McVeety relied upon the Rule  24  response.   He  pointed  out  that
    judicial review proceedings are not binding upon the Secretary of State
    or the FtT and the findings only amounted  to  a  conclusion  that  the
    Appellant may have an arguable case.

17. It was submitted that the judge had applied  the  appropriate  test  in
    considering whether there are insurmountable obstacles to  family  life
    continuing outside the UK, and it was open to  the  judge  to  conclude
    that the fact that the Sponsor lived with her parents, and was training
    to be a pharmacist did not amount to insurmountable obstacles.

18. I conclude that the FtT decision  does  not  disclose  that  the  judge
    applied an incorrect legal test.   The  appropriate  test  was  whether
    there were insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  outside
    the UK.  Insurmountable obstacles  is  a  phrase  defined  in  EX.2  of
    Appendix FM which for ease of reference is set out below;

         "For the purposes of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  insurmountable  obstacle
         means the very significant difficulties which would be faced by the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

19. The judge does not set out the above definition, but that without  more
    does not mean that the incorrect test has  been  applied.   The  phrase
    "insurmountable obstacles" is explained in Agyarko [2017] UKSC  11  and
    the judge specifically makes reference to Agyarko at  paragraph  20  of
    the FtT decision.  The Appellant in Agyarko was a national of Ghana who
    married, by proxy, a British citizen who had lived in the UK almost all
    his life and was in full-time employment.  The Supreme Court  found  in
    Agyarko that those  circumstances  did  not  amount  to  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.

20. In my view it was open to the judge to find at paragraph 20 that  there
    was no evidence of "anything  beyond  the  normal  bonds  of  emotional
    dependence between adult  parent  and  child  and  adult  siblings"  in
    relation to the Sponsor living with  her  parents  and  siblings.   The
    Appellant also lived with the Sponsor.  That is a finding  that  in  my
    view was clearly open to the judge to make, and the grounds upon  which
    permission to appeal was granted, do not disclose a material  error  of
    law, but disclose a disagreement with the  conclusion  reached  by  the
    judge.

21. The judge took into account (paragraph 19) that  the  Sponsor's  career
    and training are very important to her, and was aware that her training
    would be completed at the end of  2018.   The  judge  was  entitled  to
    conclude that evidence had not been presented to show that the  Sponsor
    would be unable to use her pharmacy  qualification  in  Pakistan.   The
    judge noted that the Sponsor had arrived in the  UK  from  Pakistan  in
    2008 and would be familiar with the language and  culture.   The  judge
    took into account at paragraph 24, the submission made by Mr Salam that
    in Pakistan the Sponsor would not have the same type of  employment  as
    she would find in the UK and would effectively be working  as  a  sales
    person rather than a pharmacist,  but  noted  that  no  documentary  or
    country information was submitted in support of that assertion.

22. The judge was entitled to conclude  that  the  Sponsor's  career  as  a
    pharmacist did not amount to insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing in Pakistan.

23. The point in relation to the previous judicial  review  proceedings  is
    without merit.  It is correct that the judge did  not  refer  to  those
    proceedings but that is not an error of law.   Two  High  Court  Judges
    found in previous judicial  review  proceedings  that  the  Appellant's
    relationship with the Sponsor who was training to be a pharmacist makes
    the case "at least arguable".  The function of the judge, was to make a
    decision on an arguable case and that function was discharged.

24. The judge did not err in failing to refer to Chikwamba.  The  offer  of
    employment materialised after the FtT decision.   The  position  before
    the judge was outlined at paragraph 19, in  which  the  Sponsor  stated
    that she had recently received a job offer from the NHS to  work  as  a
    hospital pharmacist  once  her  training  is  completed.   It  was  not
    therefore the case the Sponsor would automatically have  an  income  in
    excess of the minimum required of �18,600 per year.  That may have been
    the case once the training was complete, but was not the case when  the
    judge heard the appeal, and therefore it was not automatic that if  the
    Appellant had to apply  for  entry  clearance  from  abroad,  that  his
    application would be granted.  I find no merit in this point.

25. I do not find that the judge materially erred  in  considering  section
    117B of the 2002 Act.  The judge was entitled to note at  paragraph  36
    that the Sponsor was fully  aware  of  the  precarious  nature  of  the
    Appellant's status on arrival, when she embarked on a relationship with
    him, and was also aware that he was an illegal  overstayer  from  2014.
    The judge was entitled to conclude that neither the Appellant  nor  the
    Sponsor had any basis to believe that the Appellant would be allowed to
    remain in the UK.  The Supreme Court at paragraph 49  of  Agyarko  made
    reference to Jeuness to the effect that an important consideration when
    assessing proportionality under Article  8,  of  the  removal  of  non-
    settled migrants, is whether family life was created at a time when the
    persons involved were aware that the immigration status of one of  them
    was such that the persistence of family life would from the  outset  be
    precarious.  In such a case it was said that "it is likely only  to  be
    in exceptional circumstances  that  the  removal  of  the  non-national
    family member will constitute a violation of Article 8."

26. In  my  view  the  judge  followed  the  correct  legal  approach  when
    considering this appeal.  The judge did not reach any conclusions which
    could be said to be irrational or perverse.  The judge  considered  all
    the evidence  and  gave  sustainable  reasons  for  findings  made.   I
    conclude that the grounds upon which permission to appeal was  granted,
    disclose a disagreement with the conclusions reached by the judge,  but
    do not disclose a material error of law.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT does not disclose a material error  of  law.   I  do
not set aside the decision of the FtT.  The appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

The FtT made no anonymity direction.  There  was  no  request  made  to  the
Upper Tribunal for anonymity, and  I  see  no  need  to  make  an  anonymity
direction.
