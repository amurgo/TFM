This decision follows a remote hearing in respect of  which  there  has  not
objection by the parties. The form of remote hearing was by video (V),  the
platform was Skype for Business. A  face  to  face  hearing  was  not  held
because it was not practicable and all  issues  could  be  determined  in  a
remote hearing.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal R Oliver (the judge) who, in a decision promulgated on  11
         February 2020, dismissed the appeal of AHA (appellant) against  the
         decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         (respondent) dated 20 November 2019 refusing his asylum  and  human
         rights claim and his claim for Humanitarian Protection (HP).


Background

      2. The appellant is a national of Somalia. He was aged 28 at the  date
         of the judge's decision. He was born and lived in Mogadishu and  is
         a member of the Reer Faqi tribe,  a  subgroup  of  the  Reer  Hamar
         minority  clan.  According  to  the  information  he  gave  in  his
         screening interviews (both on 30 July 2018) and in his  substantive
         asylum interview (24 May 2019) he  is  married  and  his  wife  and
         parents were  in  Somalia,  as  were  some  of  his  siblings.  The
         appellant subsequently claimed that his  wife  left  Somalia  on  2
         October 2019, that one of his brothers died  in  a  bomb  explosion
         near the Mogadishu airport, that his father died  on  hearing  this
         news, and that his mother and siblings had now all left Somalia. In
         his screening interviews the appellant claimed to have worked in an
         Internet cafe in Mogadishu and he later claimed  in  his  statement
         dated 19 December 2019 that he also repaired computers in the  same
         premises. The appellant claimed  that  he  would  be  subjected  to
         persecution in Somalia on account of  having  no  family  or  other
         support, his membership of a minority clan, and because he would be
         targeted by Al-Shabaab on account of his familial relationship with
         his uncle, a government employee who was killed  by  Al-Shabaab  in
         December  2018,  and  because  Al-Shabaab  wanted  to  utilise  the
         appellant's skills at repairing computers.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      3. The judge heard oral evidence  from  the  appellant  and  from  the
         appellant's maternal aunt, MH.  At  [24]  the  judge  rejected  the
         appellant's claim that his wife had left Mogadishu. The judge noted
         that the appellant's story had "developed" since he  first  applied
         for asylum to the extent that he now claimed to have no  family  at
         all in Somalia.  The  judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had  been
         inconsistent in his initial claim to fear persecution at the  hands
         of Al-Shabaab. The judge queried how  the  appellant's  wife  could
         afford to fly to the UK given the claimed lack of family resources,
         and he noted that the appellant had not sought any assistance  from
         the Somali community to try to trace her. At [22] the  judge  noted
         that the appellant's maternal aunt had not  asked  the  appellant's
         mother where the appellant's wife was when  they  were  in  contact
         with each other. The judge did not accept that the appellant's wife
         had left Somalia.


      4. At [25] the judge rejected the appellant's claim to fear Al-Shabaab
         as he himself had not been a government employee  and  was  only  a
         nephew of the government  employee,  and  because  the  appellant's
         belief that Al-Shabaab  wanted  to  use  his  computer  skills  was
         "entirely speculative".

      5. At [26]  the  judge  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had
         established that he had no family members still living in Mogadishu
         because he gave no evidence of any attempt to contact other  family
         members for potential up-to-date information,  or  any  attempt  to
         contact them via the Somali community. At [27] the  judge  was  not
         satisfied that the appellant  would  be  entitled  to  Humanitarian
         Protection under  article  15(c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive
         (2004/83/EC) because he was  a  fit  young  man  who  had  computer
         skills.

      6. The judge dismissed the appeal.

The challenge to the judge's decision

      7.  The  Grounds  of  Appeal,  amplified  by  Ms  Reid  in  her   oral
         submissions, contend that the judge failed to apply guidance in MOJ
         & Ors (Return to Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442 (IAC) (the
         1st ground), and the judge failed to give reasons for not accepting
         the appellant's evidence that he had no family in Somalia (the  2nd
         ground). In respect of the 1st ground, the judge  failed  to  apply
         the considerations contained at paragraphs 407 and 408 of MOJ,  and
         in particular, the length of the appellant's absence Mogadishu, his
         membership of a  minority  clan,  and  that  he  has  no  financial
         resources of his own and that remittances from the UK  was  not  an
         option (something in respect of which the judge made no  particular
         findings).


      8. In respect of the  2nd  ground,  whilst  the  judge  rehearsed  the
         appellant's evidence in respect of his claim that his wife had left
         Somalia at [24], the judge failed to actually give any reasons  for
         rejecting this evidence. There was said to be no link by the  judge
         between his recitation of evidence and his observations  concerning
         the Somali community and his rejection  of  the  appellant's  claim
         concerning his wife's location.

Discussion

      9. It is appropriate to consider the 2nd ground of challenge first. At
         the outset of [24] the judge noted that the appellant had, at least
         initially, been inconsistent in his claim regarding Al-Shabaab.  In
         his first  screening  interview  the  appellant  claimed  that  his
         brother had been involved with Al-Shabaab and was  killed  when  he
         "blew himself up". Al-Shabaab  asked  the  appellant  to  take  his
         brother's place. In his second screening  interview  the  appellant
         admitted that neither he nor his brother had any  involvement  with
         Al-Shabaab. Whilst the judge did  not  draw  an  adverse  inference
         based on the appellant pretending to faint at the airport after  he
         arrived in the UK, the judge did find that the appellant's  initial
         misrepresentation undermined his general credibility. The judge was
         unarguably entitled to so conclude. It was in this context that the
         judge considered the evidence relating  to  the  appellant's  wife.
         Whilst I accept that the appellant did not  give  any  inconsistent
         evidence in respect of his wife, his initial decision to  fabricate
         his reasons for fleeing Somalia was a relevant factor  to  consider
         'in  the  round'  when  determining  whether  the   appellant   had
         discharged the lower standard of proof in respect of his account of
         his wife's location. It is readily apparent from a holistic reading
         of [24] that the judge did take into account this inconsistent when
         assessing the appellant's evidence relating to his wife's location.


     10. The judge then commented that it was unclear  how  the  appellant's
         wife would join him in the UK, as  he  claimed  she  would  in  his
         screening interview, given his claim to have no  family  resources.
         This was a point rationally open to the judge  and  which,  in  the
         context  of  [24],  informed  his  assessment  of  the  appellant's
         evidence relating to his  wife.  The  judge  then  noted  that  the
         appellant had not attempted to locate his wife with the  assistance
         of  the  Somali  community  which  had  the  means  of  discovering
         information.  Although  Ms  Reid  submitted  that  there   was   no
         connection link between this assertion and the judge's finding that
         the appellant's wife  was  still  in  Mogadishu,  I  am  satisfied,
         reading the paragraph as a whole, that the  judge  was  drawing  an
         adverse inference based on the appellant's failure to  utilise  the
         Somali community  networks  to  try  to  locate  his  wife.  It  is
         irresistibly implicit in the judge's reference to  the  failure  by
         the appellant to utilise the Somali community to try to  trace  his
         wife that the judge doubted the appellant's  claim  that  his  wife
         left the country. This must also be considered in the context  that
         the appellant's aunt has not asked the appellant's  mother  if  she
         knew of the location of the appellant's wife  [22].  Drawing  these
         strands together, I am satisfied the judge  gave  legally  adequate
         reasons for  concluding  at  [24]  that  the  appellant  failed  to
         discharge the burden of proving that his wife left Somalia.


     11. I now consider the 1st ground of appeal. At  paragraph  12  of  her
         renewed grounds Ms Reid submits that the judge failed  to  consider
         the factors identified in paragraph 425 of  MOJ,  although  in  her
         written submissions and at the remote hearing  she  relied  on  the
         factors in paragraph 407 of MOJ. Paragraph 407 is more relevant  as
         paragraph 425 relates to a person relocating to Mogadishu;  as  the
         appellant hails from Mogadishu, he would not be someone  relocating
         to the city. Ms Reid emphasised that the judge failed to  consider,
         in particular, the appellant's absence from Mogadishu, the issue of
         whether he had his own financial resources and the  possibility  of
         remittances of funds from the UK, and his membership of a  minority
         clan.

     12. Although the judge did not make express reference to the length  of
         the appellant's absence  from  Mogadishu,  it  is  clear  from  the
         determination, read as a whole (e.g. [12], [13]) that he was  aware
         of the appellant's immigration history. It is not likely, in  these
         circumstances, that the judge would have ignored the length of  the
         appellant's absence from  Mogadishu.  The  appellant  has,  in  any
         event, been absent from the city for a relatively short  period  of
         time (just over 2 years if he left at the end of 2017)  and  it  is
         not likely that there would have been any material  change  in  the
         appellant's knowledge and understanding of the city in  that  short
         space of time. It is also apparent from the  decision,  read  as  a
         whole, that the judge was aware that the appellant was a member  of
         a minority clan, but that he had not experienced  any  violence  or
         discrimination as  a  result  [13].  Although  MOJ  indicated  that
         minority clans may have little to offer  their  members,  it  found
         that members of minority clans suffered no  clan  violence  and  no
         clan discriminatory treatment (at paragraph 407(f) &  (g)).  It  is
         not arguable, reading the decision  as  a  whole,  that  the  judge
         failed to  take  into  account  the  appellant's  membership  of  a
         minority clan with respect to the factors in paragraph 407.

     13.  The grounds contend that the judge's assertion that the  appellant
         has computer skills is not a finding  that  he  would  be  able  to
         secure an  income.  This  assertion  does  not  however  accurately
         reflect the appellant's own evidence. In  his  screening  interview
         the appellant claimed to have worked in a caf� in Mogadishu,  which
         he confirmed as an Internet  caf�  in  his  substantive  interview,
         which was owned  by  a  friend.  In  his  statement  the  appellant
         explained  that  he  used  his  computer  skills  to  fix  people's
         computers in the Internet caf�, which doubled as a workshop. It  is
         apparent from this  evidence  that  the  appellant  had  worked  in
         Mogadishu earning money from his 'computer skills'. The  judge  had
         made specific  reference  to  the  appellant's  statement  and  his
         evidence that he repaired computers [19]. Although it may have been
         preferable at [27] for the judge to have made express reference  to
         the appellant having earned money from  repairing  computers  using
         his 'computer skills', I am entirely satisfied that the  judge  had
         in mind the totality of the appellant's evidence when referring  to
         'computer skills' and that the judge did link  this  evidence  with
         the factors at  paragraph  407  of  MOJ,  and  in  particular,  the
         appellant's prospects of securing a livelihood.  No  challenge  has
         been made to the judge's rejection of the appellant's claim that he
         would be targeted by Al-Shabaab as a result of his computer  skills
         and the judge was unarguably entitled to find this assertion to  be
         entirely speculative.


     14. The judge's assessment of the factors in paragraph 407 must also be
         considered in the  context  of  his  finding,  which  I  found  was
         lawfully open to him for  the  reasons  set  out  above,  that  the
         appellant's wife remained in Mogadishu and that  he  therefore  did
         have family or a close relative in the city who could  assist  him.
         The judge's findings, when considered as a whole, do indicate  that
         he applied the factors in paragraph 407 of MOJ and were  sufficient
         to entitle him to conclude that the appellant did not  qualify  for
         Humanitarian Protection if returned to Mogadishu.
