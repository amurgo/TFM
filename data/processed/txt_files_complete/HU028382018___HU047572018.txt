Officer)
For the Respondents:   Mr D Bazini (for AYJ Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 14 January 2019 allowing  the  appeals  of
       Manish Mahendrakumar and Hetalben Manish  Patel,  husband  and  wife,
       citizens of India born 17 August 1985 and 12 August  1988.  They  had
       appealed against the refusal of their applications for further  leave
       of 10 January 2018.

    2. Their applications had been  refused  because  of  the  Secretary  of
       State's conclusion that Mr Patel (the First Respondent)  lacked  good
       character, having failed to adequately explain discrepancies  in  the
       earnings he had reported to UKVI for immigration purposes and to HMRC
       for tax purposes.

    3. The discrepancy arose from the fact that his extension application of
       May 2013 within the Tier 1 General route asserted earnings of �37,758
       by way of �13,715 from employment and �24,043  from  self-employment,
       whereas for the tax year ending April 2013 he had initially  declared
       a total  income  of  �16,755  (based  on  earnings  as  �12,450  from
       employment and  �4,305  from  self-employment).  This  was  shown  by
       information received from HMRC, subsequently confirmed  by  Mr  Patel
       himself.  A  revised  tax  calculation,  which  he  revealed  to  the
       Secretary of State in response to a tax questionnaire sent to him  in
       May 2017, indicated that  he  had  submitted  an  amended  return  in
       January 2016.

    4. The Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  Mr  Patel  had  shown  bad
       character in his dealings with UK  government  departments;  his  tax
       correction had been made so close  to  the  date  of  his  settlement
       application as to be  suspicious.  This  was  all  considered  highly
       inconsistent.

    5. Before the First-tier Tribunal, Mr Patel gave a detailed  explanation
       of what  had  happened.  A  chartered  accountant  had  produced  his
       accounts for the immigration extension application. However, Mr Patel
       had originally completed his own tax returns from March 2010, as this
       was cheap and easy. He used online tutorials and videos as  guidance.
       However, he had misunderstood the basis on which  household  expenses
       could be charged against profits: he had  offset  the  whole  of  his
       household expenses against profits rather than only a  proportion  of
       them.

    6. Mr Patel first instructed Kay Plus Accountancy as his  accountant  in
       December 2014. Kay Plus did not identify any problem  with  his  past
       tax reporting, as they  relied  on  his  P60s,  bank  statements  and
       invoices, without making any further enquiry  of  him.  He  had  been
       unable to contact Kay Plus in November 2015, when he  first  realised
       there was a problem when  he  was  looking  to  support  his  claimed
       earnings when making a mortgage application in November 2015.  So  he
       went  to  another  accountant,  (named  Mr  Patel  like   the   First
       Respondent), to confirm the reliability  of  his  earnings;  but  the
       accountant Mr Patel was concerned about the level of expenses claimed
       in the financial year ending April  2013  and  questioned  the  First
       Respondent about it. This revealed the error  in  question,  and  the
       accountant then informed HMRC, telling Mr Patel that there was a six-
       year window within which to amend his tax affairs. He duly  made  his
       January 2016 amended return, and received notice of his corrected tax
       liability in April 2016; he had paid off the outstanding tax  balance
       by November 2016.   The enquiries of the new accountant also revealed
       some under-reporting of tax liability for the year ending April  2010
       for which he made recompense at the same time.

    7. The First-tier Tribunal reviewed the evidence before  it,  and  found
       that whilst the Secretary of State had successfully  put  Mr  Patel's
       character in issue given  the  original  earnings  discrepancies,  Mr
       Patel had subsequently provided a cogent explanation for his conduct.
       It found that Mr Patel had withstood  thorough  and  competent  cross
       examination and on balance found him to be a truthful witness. Having
       regard  to  the  considerations  identified  in  Khan,   Mr   Patel's
       explanation was a credible one, particularly when  it  was  borne  in
       mind that it had been consistently provided to the Secretary of State
       once enquiries had been made as to his tax reporting. There was  also
       an accountant's letter of October 2017 which confirmed the  position,
       and HMRC had amended his tax liability and were now  fully  aware  of
       the situation. The Judge noted that Mr Patel had been careless in his
       dealings,  surprisingly  so  for  an  educated  man,   but   it   was
       nevertheless plausible  that  he  had  misunderstood  the  extent  of
       expenses that could be claimed. Accordingly the appeal was allowed on
       human rights grounds.

    8. The Secretary of State appealed on  the  basis  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law  by  failing  to  have  express  regard  to
       paragraph 25 of Appendix A to the Rules.  Permission  to  appeal  was
       granted on this issue, expressly without enthusiasm by the Judge,  on
       the basis that this submission  flagged  up  the  need  for  thorough
       attention to have  been  given  to  whether  there  was  an  adequate
       explanation for the different income figure having been given in  the
       immigration extension application.

    9. Mr Whitwell made submissions of  admirable  concision,  acknowledging
       that as indicated by the Judge granting  permission  that  there  was
       only just enough in the Home Office case to warrant a hearing in  the
       Upper Tribunal. He acknowledged that the Appendix A argument had  not
       been put below, and that there  was  no  duty  on  a  Judge  to  give
       extensive   reasons   when   accepting   a   witness's   credibility.
       Nevertheless  he  submitted  that   there   were   very   significant
       differences between the earnings reported to HMRC and UKVI,  and  the
       Judge had had insufficient regard to this factor.

   10. Mr Bazini pointed to the Respondent's witness statement,  the  thrust
       of which had been summarised by the Judge below. This was  an  appeal
       where the Judge had made clear  favourable  credibility  findings  on
       evidence  which  addressed  every  relevant  issue,   including   the
       difference  between  profits  and  earnings:  that  was   necessarily
       inferred by her acceptance of the First Respondent's evidence.

  Decision and reasons

   11. During the currency of the Tier 1 General route, Appendix A stated:

           "25.  Where the earnings are the profits of a  business  derived
           through self-employment or other business activities:

                (a)    the earnings that will be assessed are the profits of
                the business before tax. Where  the  applicant  only  has  a
                share of the business, the earnings that  will  be  assessed
                are the profits of the business  before  tax  to  which  the
                applicant is entitled, and

                (b)    the applicant must be registered as self-employed  in
                the UK, and must provide the specified evidence."

   12. The headnote in Khan [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) states:

           "(i)  Where there has been a significant difference between  the
           income claimed in a previous application for leave to remain and
           the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is  entitled
           to draw an inference that the Applicant has  been  deceitful  or
           dishonest  and  therefore  he  should  be  refused  ILR   within
           paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.   Such  an  inference
           could be expected where there is no  plausible  explanation  for
           the discrepancy.

           (ii)  Where an Applicant has presented evidence  to  show  that,
           despite the prima facie inference, he was not in fact  dishonest
           but only careless, then  the  Secretary  of  State  must  decide
           whether the explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her view,
           to displace the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.

           (iii) In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
           State should remind herself that, although the standard of proof
           is the "balance of probability", a finding  that  a  person  has
           been deceitful and dishonest in relation to his tax affairs with
           the consequence that he is denied settlement in this country  is
           a very serious finding with serious consequences.

           ...

           (v)   When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest
           or merely careless the Secretary of State  should  consider  the
           following matters, inter alia, as well as the  extent  to  which
           they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

                ...

                iii.   Why the Applicant did not realise that an  error  had
                been made because his liability to pay tax was less than  he
                should have expected;

                 iv.   Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps
                to remedy the situation and, if so, when  those  steps  were
                taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

   13. Toulson LJ in JK (Democratic Republic of Congo) [2007] EWCA  Civ  831
       �31 reminds the reader that it may be unrealistic to expect  a  Judge
       who accepts oral evidence to do very much more than to  set  out  the
       competing considerations arising from the evidence and then to  state
       his conclusion upon them:

           "The degree of reasoning required to support a finding  of  fact
           must depend on the circumstances.   If  a  judge  disbelieves  a
           witness in evidence, he must obviously state why he  disbelieves
           it.  If he believes a witness's evidence, there may be not  much
           more that the judge can say than to refer in summary to the main
           points advanced to the contrary,  together  with  the  witness's
           response to them, in order to show that the judge has considered
           them, and to express his conclusion that he finds the witness to
           be credible."

   14. In  this  appeal  the  First-tier  Tribunal  gave  full  reasons  for
       accepting Mr Patel's credibility. They are certainly adequate to  the
       degree that no party to the appeal could be confused or misled as  to
       the Judge's thinking: she concluded that he had given cogent evidence
       that had withstood sustained  cross  examination.   She  was  clearly
       alive to the inherent improbability that  an  educated  person  would
       make a mistake of the scale here.

   15. The Secretary of State's reliance on the Appendix A requirements  for
       earnings to be established (wholly unsurprisingly) by profits  rather
       than turnover simply amounts to an attempt to elevate a dispute  with
       the factual findings to the terrain of  error  of  law.  However,  it
       fails so to do. The Judge was clearly alive to the fact that  it  was
       profit rather than turnover  that  is  of  central  concern  for  the
       acquisition of points in  a  Tier  1  General  application.  That  is
       demonstrated  by  her  clear  understanding   of   the   Respondent's
       explanation, which was that he had grossly overcharged  the  expenses
       that were deductible against his business's profits. He had  deducted
       all household expenses on the basis that he worked from home, when in
       reality  only  a  proportion  of  those  expenses  would  have   been
       deductible.

   16. One can cross-check the cogency of the Judge's findings by  reference
       to the matters identified as potentially relevant in these  cases  in
       Khan. Of course, this is not a case where an  accountant  was  blamed
       for the mistake: Mr Patel took responsibility  for  his  tax  returns
       himself. The explanation of the timing of his discovery of the  error
       (ie when he was establishing  his  earnings  for  the  purpose  of  a
       mortgage application) was considered plausible. And all this arose in
       a context where he had made another mistake in his  tax  returns  for
       the year ending April 2010, at a time when he did not in fact have to
       demonstrate earnings for Tier 1 General purposes, and which would not
       have been within the period normally examined by the standard enquiry
       process now instigated in this class of case (which  concentrates  on
       the entry point and extension point in that route).

   17. Accordingly I find there to be  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
       reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal.




  Decision:

  The appeal is dismissed.
