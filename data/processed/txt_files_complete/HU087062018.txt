Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr.  R. Ahmed, Instructed by JJ Law Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr. L. Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal ("FtT")
      Judge Moore promulgated on 29th October 2018.  The FtT Judge dismissed
      the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision of 27th March
      2018 refusing her application for leave to remain in the UK under
      Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules on the basis of her family life
      with her partner, Mr Sarfaraz Khan.


   2. Broadly stated, the respondent gave two reasons for refusing the
      application for leave to remain.  First, the appellant did not meet
      the eligibility financial requirement set out in paragraphs E-
      LTRP.3.11. to 3.4. of Appendix FM of the immigration rules.  The
      appellant was required to demonstrate that she could meet the
      financial requirement of �18,600.00. Although the appellant claimed
      that the requirement was met on the basis that her sponsor has an
      annual income in excess of �18,600.00, no evidence had been provided
      to support that claim.  Second, the appellant did not meet the
      eligibility English language requirement set out in paragraphs E-
      LTRP.4.1 to 4.2 of Appendix FM of the rules.


   3. The appeal was dismissed by FtT Judge Moore.  In the grounds of
      appeal, the appellant claims that the Judge erred by considering
      matters as at the date of decision, and not the date of hearing.
      Furthermore, the Judge erred in his assessment of the evidence before
      the Tribunal as to the income of the appellant's sponsor.  The
      appellant claims that there was, in the various bundles relied upon by
      the appellant, evidence of earnings that the Judge simply had no
      regard to, in reaching his decision.  Permission to appeal was granted
      by FtT Judge Chohan on 24th November 2018. The matter comes before me
      to consider whether or not the decision of FtT Judge Moore involved
      the making of a material error of law, and if the decision is set
      aside, to re-make the decision.


   4. At paragraph [5] of his decision, the FtT Judge sets out the evidence
      that was before him.  It is unfortunate that the appellant's
      representatives felt it necessary to put before the FtT three separate
      bundles.  The first comprising of 272 pages.  The second comprising of
      136 pages, and the third, a 'supplementary bundle', bizarrely
      comprising of pages 1 to 19 and pages 46 to 80.  It is right, as Mr
      Ahmed accepts before me, that the evidence was put before the FtT in
      an incoherent fashion and the evidence was "in a mess".


   5. At paragraph [7] of his decision, the Judge states that "The burden of
      proof is on the appellant to show that as at the date, the
      Respondent's immigration decision was, on the balance of
      probabilities, against the weight of the evidence.".  Although it
      seems that the Judge might have erroneously proceeded upon the premise
      that he was considering matters as they were at the date of the
      respondent's decision, a careful reading of the decision establishes
      that the Judge properly considered matters as they were at the time of
      the appeal.  The Judge accepted that the appellant had by the time of
      the hearing, provided an English Language certificate and noted, at
      [8], that "..as of today that requirement had been met.".  On its own,
      I am not persuaded that there was a material error of law in the
      decision of the FtT Judge by reference to what the Judge stated at
      paragraph [7].


   6. The appellant accepts that Appendix FM requires an applicant to
      provide specified evidence of a gross annual income of at least
      �18,600.  The appellant claims that the FtT Judge erred in his
      analysis of whether the minimum income requirement could be met
      because the FtT Judge failed to have regard to all the evidence before
      him.   At the hearing before me, Mr Ahmed submitted that there was a
      wealth of evidence before the Judge in the form of payslips and bank
      statements confirming the earnings of the appellant's sponsor for the
      twelve month period between September 2017 and September 2018, that
      the FtT Judge failed to have regard to.  That evidence, it was
      submitted, established that the appellant's sponsor had in the 12
      months leading to the hearing of the appeal, earned in excess of the
      minimum income of �18,600 that the appellant was required to
      demonstrate.  He submitted that if the Judge had considered that
      evidence, the FtT Judge would have been satisfied that the appellant
      met the minimum income requirement, and the appeal would have been
      allowed.


   7. Mr Tarlow submitted that he was prepared to accept that the FtT Judge
      does not refer to all of the payslips and bank statements in the
      decision, but he would need the opportunity to consider the material,
      before conceding whether any failure to consider or refer to that
      evidence, was material to the outcome of the appeal.


   8. Unfortunately, neither Mr Ahmed nor Mr Tarlow had a complete copy of
      the various bundles of evidence that had been filed with the FtT, on
      behalf of the appellant prior to the hearing of the appeal before the
      FtT.  That is remarkable, particularly when the appellant has been
      represented by the same solicitors throughout, and an employee of the
      firm had attended the hearing before me, to assist Mr Ahmed.


   9. I therefore adjourned the hearing for a short period, and provided Mr
      Rashid and Mr Tarlow with the bundles in the Tribunal file.  When the
      parties returned, Mr Tarlow accepted, having had the opportunity to
      consider the wage slips and bank statements that were in the evidence
      before the FtT Judge, that the failure to refer to that evidence, did
      indeed amount to a material error of law.  He accepted that the
      payslips before the Tribunal, the genuineness of which was not in
      issue, established that in the 12 months before the hearing of the
      appeal, the appellant's sponsor had indeed received an income in
      excess of the �18,600 requirement and the income shown on the
      payslips, was corroborated by payments into the sponsor's bank
      account.  He conceded that the appellant was therefore able to
      establish that the financial requirement under the rules was in fact
      met by the appellant, and the Judge erred in law in his finding to the
      contrary.


  10.  Mr Tarlow conceded that the decision of the FtT Judge is infected by
      a material error of law, and must be set aside.


Re-making the decision


  11. The only ground of appeal available  to  the  appellant  is  that  the
      respondent's decision is unlawful under s6 of  the  Human  Rights  Act
      1998.  As to the Article 8 claim, the burden  of  proof  is  upon  the
      appellant to show, on the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  she  has
      established a family life with her husband, and that her removal  from
      the UK as a result of the respondent's decision, would interfere  with
      that right. It is then for the respondent to justify any  interference
      caused. The respondent's decision must be in accordance with  the  law
      and must be a proportionate response in  all  the  circumstances.   If
      Article 8 is engaged, the Tribunal may need to look at the  extent  to
      which an appellant is said to have failed to meet the requirements  of
      the rules, because  that  may  inform  the  proportionality  balancing
      exercise that must follow.


  12. As to the human rights  claim  on  Article  8  grounds,  I  adopt  the
      approach set out by Lord Bingham in Razgar [2014]  UKHL  27.   I  must
      first determine whether Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged at  all.   If
      Article 8 is engaged, I should go on to consider  the  remaining  four
      stages identified in Razgar.


  13. The respondent did not claim that the appellant is not married to,  or
      in a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  her  partner,  who  is
      settled in the UK.  It is uncontroversial that the appellant enjoys  a
      family life with her husband. I also find that the decision to  refuse
      the appellant leave to remain may have consequences of such gravity as
      potentially to engage the operation of Article 8.  I accept  that  the
      interference is in accordance with the law, and that the  interference
      is necessary to protect the economic well-being of the country.


  14. The issue in this appeal,  as  is  often  the  case,  is  whether  the
      interference is proportionate to the legitimate public end  sought  to
      be achieved.  In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry  clearance)  [2015]  UKUT
      112 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held  that  the  claimant's  ability  to
      satisfy the immigration rules is not the question to be determined  by
      the  Tribunal,  but  is  capable  of  being  a  weighty,  though   not
      determinative  factor,  when  deciding   whether   such   refusal   is
      proportionate to the legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control.


  15. The respondent was not satisfied that the appellant met the minimum
      income requirements set out in Appendix FM.  It is now accepted by Mr
      Tarlow that the evidence that was before the FtT Judge and before me,
      establishes that the appellant's sponsor has a gross salary exceeding
      the required �18,600 per annum.


  16. I remind myself that section 117A of the Nationality, Immigration and
      Asylum Act 2002 requires that in considering the public interest
      question, I must (in particular) have regard to the considerations
      listed in section 117B.  I acknowledge that the maintenance of
      effective immigration controls is in the public interest. On the
      evidence before me, and in light of the unchallenged findings made by
      the FtT Judge, I am satisfied that the appellant is able to meet the
      substantive part of the rules.  There is nothing in my judgment that
      weighs against the appellant in a proportionality assessment.


  17. Having considered the evidence before me and taking all the relevant
      factors into account including those in S117B of the 2002 Act, I am
      satisfied, on the facts here as now accepted by the respondent, that
      the decision to refuse the appellant leave to remain in the UK as a
      partner, is disproportionate to the legitimate aim of immigration
      control. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the decision to refuse the
      appellant leave to remain would be in breach of Article 8.


  18. It follows that I set aside the decision of the FtT Judge, and the
      appeal is allowed on Article 8 grounds.


Notice of Decision


  19. The decision of the FtT Judge involved the making of an error of law
      such that it is set aside.


  20. I re-make the decision and allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

  21. No anonymity direction is made.

 TO THE RESPONDENT


 FEE AWARD


      Although I have allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds, I decline to
      make a fee award in favour of the appellant.  The appeal has been
      allowed based on the evidence before the FtT Judge, and now before me,
      that was not before the respondent at the time of the decision
      appealed.
