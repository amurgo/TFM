SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Respondent





Representation:

	For the Appellant:	In Person

	For the Respondent:	Mrs H Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

	

	

	DECISION AND REASONS

	

	The appellant, a national of Guinea born on 15 December 1986, appealed against the respondent’s decision to refuse to issue her with a residence card under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (“the EEA Regulations”) as the extended family member (partner) of an EEA national.

	

	In a decision promulgated on 13 January 2017, Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction on the basis that the appellant did not have a right of appeal for the reasons given in the case of Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411. The appellant sought permission to appeal against that decision and on 7 December 2017 permission was granted in the Upper Tribunal in light of the judgment in Khan v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755, overturning Sala. 



	In granting permission the Upper Tribunal indicated that it was minded to find an error of law, set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal. Neither party raised any objection to that course, but for some reason the appeal was listed for hearing.



	Following the agreement of the parties I set aside the decision of Judge McCarthy and have remitted the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

	

	DECISION



	The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of law. The decision is set aside. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, to be dealt with afresh, pursuant to section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and Practice Statement 7.2(b), before any judge aside from Judge McCarthy.
