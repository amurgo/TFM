For the Appellant:     in person
For the Respondent:    Mr Kingham, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The Appellant, born 27 October 1986, is a citizen of Pakistan.

      2. On 27 August 2014 the Appellant applied  for  a  variation  of  her
         leave to remain as the dependent of her husband, a Tier 4 (General)
         Student.

      3. That application was refused on 31 December 2014 on the basis  that
         her husband's simultaneous application for a variation of his leave
         to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student  had  been  refused  on  21
         October 2014, when a s47 removal decision had  also  been  made  in
         relation to him. Thus a s47  removal  decision  was  also  made  in
         relation to the Appellant.

      4. The Appellant duly appealed against those immigration decisions and
         her appeal was heard on 11 May 2015 by Judge Pickup,  and  disposed
         of on the papers filed at her request.  The  appeal  was  dismissed
         under the Immigration Rules in a Decision  promulgated  on  12  May
         2015.

      5.  The  Appellant's  application  to  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  for
         permission to appeal was refused by Judge Ford on 24 July 2015, but
         the renewed application to the Upper Tribunal was allowed by  Upper
         Tribunal Judge Blum on 10 September 2015 given that the Appellant's
         husband had been granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal
         against the decisions made in relation to him.

      6. Thus the matter comes before me.

      7. Upon the appeal being called on for  hearing  I  explained  to  the
         Appellant and her husband that although  Judge  Blum  had  directed
         that the Appellant's appeal should be linked to the appeal  pursued
         by her husband, and listed for hearing before the same  Judge,  the
         appeals had not  been  linked,  apparently  through  administrative
         oversight. I explained that in  my  view  nothing  turned  on  that
         because as it turned out, it was I who had heard the appeal of  the
         Appellant's husband on 21  October  2015.  The  Appellant  accepted
         that, and accepted that she had no  objection  to  my  hearing  her
         appeal.

    The decision under appeal

      8. The Appellant accepts that in the light of the decision promulgated
         by the Upper Tribunal on 24 November 2015 in her  husband's  appeal
         (IA/06496/2015) she cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules. She
         proposes to leave the UK and pursue her career abroad.

      9. No Article 8 appeal was pursued before the First Tier  Tribunal  by
         the Appellant. There was no material before the Judge  that  should
         have alerted her to the need to consider  of  her  own  motion  the
         guidance to be found in Nasim [2014] UKUT 25, and  no  evidence  to
         establish that the decisions under appeal  engaged  her  Article  8
         rights.

     10. There is in the circumstances no  material  error  of  law  in  the
         decision  of  Judge  Pickup  to  dismiss  the  appeal   under   the
         Immigration Rules that requires that decision to be set  aside  and
         remade.  The  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal   is   accordingly
         confirmed.

DECISION

    The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    12 May 2015 did not involve the making  of  an  error  of  law  in  the
    decision to dismiss the appeal that requires that decision  to  be  set
    aside and remade. The decision to dismiss  the  appeal  is  accordingly
    confirmed.

Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008

    The Appellant did not seek anonymity before the  First  Tier  Tribunal,
    and no request for anonymity is made to me.  There  appears  to  be  no
    proper basis for the Upper Tribunal to make such a direction of its own
    motion.
