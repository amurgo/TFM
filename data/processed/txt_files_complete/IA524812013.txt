                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge E M Smith promulgated on 26th February 2014, following a  hearing
    at Nottingham  Magistrates'  Court  on  14th  February  2014.   In  the
    determination, the judge dismissed the appeal of Mr Mohit Khosla.   The
    Appellant applied for, and was granted, permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.





The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of  India,  who  was  born  on  14th
    September 1986.  He appeals against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    dated 21st November 2013, refusing his application for leave to  remain
    in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student under paragraph 319C(h)  of  HC
    395.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he entered the UK on 3rd April 2008 as  a
    student to study at Bangor University.  In January 2010, he left the UK
    and returned to India.  On 1st November 2011, he was granted  leave  to
    enter the UK again until 1st November 2013, as a Tier 1 PSW Migrant.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge held that the Appellant's  application  was  refused  by  the
    Respondent because his previous grant of leave was a Tier 1 PSM and  he
    could not satisfy the provisions of paragraph 319C(h) for this  reason.
    The judge went on to consider Article 8 rights (paragraph 17) and  held
    that the Appellant could not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE and Appendix FM of the Rules.  The  judge  also  considered  the
    fact that the Appellant came to be in a relationship with Ms  Parnpreet
    Virk, a student studying at Aston University in  Birmingham,  but  held
    that, "I do not have any evidence before me from Ms Virk or indeed  any
    evidence in relation to the Appellant's work whilst  in  the  UK.   The
    most I have is a passing reference in his  statement"  (paragraph  20).
    The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that  the  Appellant  could  not  have
    succeeded under paragraph 319C(h) if  his  application  had  been  made
    before 1st October 2013 to vary his leave to that of a family member of
    a points-based system migrant, such being Ms  Parnpreet  Virk,  because
    the Rules prior to October 2013 did not allow a  person  who  had  been
    granted leave in  any  other  category,  from  also  then  subsequently
    applying for leave as a family member of a points-based system migrant,
    with a current Tier 4 (General) Student leave.

 6. However, the Appellant had made his application on 1st  November  2013.
    By this time the new Rules coming into effect on 1st October  2013  had
    taken effect and what was now  required  was  only  that  an  applicant
    applying for leave "must  not  have  last  been  granted"  leave  as  a
    visitor, or on temporary admission, or on temporary  release.   Any  of
    the grant of leave in any other capacity was permissible.

 7. The Appellant applied on 28th October 2013.  This is because he already
    had leave until 1st November 2013.  His application  was  to  vary  his
    leave to that of a family member of a points-based system migrant.   He
    met the requirements of paragraph 319C(h).

 8. On 14th April 2014, permission to appeal was granted by  the  Tribunal,
    on the basis that the judge  was  "manifestly  wrong"  in  stating  (at
    paragraph 16) that "the Grounds of Appeal appeared not  to  take  issue
    with paragraph 319C".  In fact, the grounds and  the  submissions  were
    based on the contention  that  the  Respondent  incorrectly  took  into
    account the "old" version of 319C.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 13th June 2014, the Appellant  appeared  in
    person  and  submitted  that  he  would  rely  upon  the   grounds   of
    application.  For his part,  Mr  Smart,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent Secretary of State, stated that new Rules came  into  effect
    on 1st October 2013.  The Appellant applied on 28th October  2013.   He
    fell to be considered under the new Rules.  On 21st November  2013  the
    decision was made against him.   It  did  very  much  appear  that  the
    Appellant satisfied the new Rules.  Mr Smart drew my attention  to  the
    "implementation" provisions set out in HC  628,  with  respect  to  the
    latest Rules.  These enabled (paragraph 131) a person who had not  been
    granted entry clearance or leave as a visitor, or temporary  admission,
    or temporary release, to apply under the new paragraph 319C(h).

Error of Law and Remaking the Decision

10. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I  should  set  aside  that  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  There is an error of  law  because  the  judge  clearly  had
    before him Grounds of Appeal and submissions directed at  showing  that
    the Respondent had failed to take  into  account  the  new  version  of
    paragraph 319C, focussing  instead  on  the  old  version.   This  then
    requires the decision to be remade.  I have remade the decision on  the
    basis of the findings of the original judge, the evidence  before  him,
    and the submissions that I have heard  today.   Prior  to  1st  October
    2013, a Tier 1 (Post-Study) worker could not switch into  the  category
    of a family member,  of  a  points-based  system  migrant.   Since  1st
    October, this is now permitted.  The Appellant's application  was  made
    on 28th November 2014.  Whereas, as before the original judge,  and  so
    also here before me now, "I do not have any evidence from  Ms  Virk..."
    (paragraph 20), this is a matter upon which the Appellant has not  been
    cross-examined, and it is a matter upon which no issue has been  taken.
    That being so,  since  the  standard  of  proof  is  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities, I find that the Appellant discharges the burden of proof
    that is upon him.

Decision

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed.

12. No anonymity order is made.
