                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The first Appellant, a national of India, date of birth  7  July  1981,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision dated 5 June 2014 to  refuse
    an application made on 4 April 2014 for leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant and to make removal directions under  Section
    47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The  basis  of
    the refusal was that the first Appellant failed to meet  the  mandatory
    requirement of such a Tier 4 application by  failing  to  accompany  it
    with a  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for  Studies  (CAS)  whereas  the
    Appellant had not shown he had either been assigned a  CAS  nor  was  a
    valid CAS to be found.  It followed that no points were  awarded  under
    attributes and no points were applied under maintenance and funds.  The
    second Appellant, a national  of  India  (dob  29  June  1991)  as  the
    Appellant's dependent wife failed as a consequence.

2.   The grounds of appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  were  generic  and
    asserted that the Respondent had failed to consider  all  the  evidence
    "furnished in respect of the said matter",  that  the  first  Appellant
    fulfilled  all  relevant   requirements,   then   made   reference   to
    compassionate grounds, the Immigration Rules, Article 8 of the ECHR and
    stated an intention to particularise each ground  at  further  hearing.
    Those grounds are dated 19 June 2014.

3.   No further particulars were  in  fact  provided  of  those  grounds  of
    appeal.  The first Appellant's Tier 4 application indicated under  Tier
    4 course details that the first Appellant did not have a CAS nor  is  a
    copy of such a document provided with the application.   There  was  no
    apparent accompanying letter from the first  Appellant  indicating  any
    reason why there was some difficulty in providing the CAS.

4.   No further representations have  been  made  on  behalf  of  the  first
    Appellant.  Directions given on 5 September 2014 indicated that if  the
    first Appellant wished to  he  could  send  further  documents  to  the
    Tribunal.

5.   On 9 March 2015, received on 10 March 2015  the  Appellants  asked  for
    the appeals to be considered on the papers instead of an  oral  hearing
    and the first Appellant said :

         "The main issue in my appeal is that I have not  provided  a  valid
         CAS letter, I request the Tribunal to grant me 60  days'  leave  to
         provide and valid CAS letter" [sic].

    The document is signed on behalf of  the  first  Appellant  and  second
    Appellant, his dependent wife, who had appealed on similar  grounds  to
    the first Appellant.  I infer from the form  of  the  letter  that  the
    first Appellant intended both his and his wife's appeals  to  be  dealt
    with on the papers.  A letter from Deccan Prime Solicitors LLP, dated 9
    March 2015,  confirmed  they  were  no  longer  acting  for  the  first
    Appellant. I cannot find documents that show they were acting  for  the
    second Appellant.

    Come what may the submitted material did not  provide  any  explanation
    for the absence of the CAS.  There  was  no  general  provision  either
    under case law or under the Immigration Rules for giving  a  person  an
    extension of 60 days in which to provide  a  CAS  letter  if  they  had
    failed to do so with the application.  It is not said that this  was  a
    case where the first Appellant was surprised by events leading  to  the
    cancellation of the CAS or there was some unexplained reason why a  CAS
    could not be issued.

6.   In these circumstances there is  simply  no  evidence  to  support  the
    grounds of appeal that the Secretary of State had  failed  to  consider
    relevant information or taken into account considerations  which  ought
    not to have been considered.  There is nothing  under  the  Immigration
    Rules which provides for a further period of 60 days nor is  there  any
    identified Tier 4 guidance which indicated  that  such  further  period
    would  be  provided  in  circumstances  pertaining  to  such   as   the
    Appellant's case.  In these circumstances the grounds have no merit and
    do not disclose any arguable error of law by the  Secretary  of  State.
    The appeal must be dismissed.

7.   I have considered whether or  not  Article  8  of  the  ECHR  might  be
    engaged but it is plain that the first Appellant's problem  was  simply
    that he could not make the appropriate application  to  obtain  a  CAS.
    There was no evidence before me to show that there  was  any  basis  on
    which Article 8 rights might be engaged either in respect of himself or
    his wife and there is nothing to  indicate  that  they  cannot  conduct
    their private and family life back in India.

8.   In these circumstances  there  is  simply  no  evidence  to  show  that
    Article 8(1) rights are engaged  or  that  the  interference  in  those
    rights by the Respondent's decision was significant.   Similarly  there
    was no evidence to show that the Respondent's decision was not  Article
    8 compliant nor that any such decision was disproportionate.

9.   In these circumstances  there  was  no  basis  to  resist  the  removal
    directions that have been made.

NOTICE OF DECISION
