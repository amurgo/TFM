                                     and

                                  L E M [A]
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Bryce, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Parties are as above, but the rest of this determination refers to them
    as they were in the FtT.

 2.  This determination is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's decision dated 12 December 2017.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge P A Grant-Hutchison,  promulgated  on  14
         August 2018, allowing the appeal.

     iv) The SSHD's grounds of appeal to the UT, stated in  the  application
         for permission to appeal dated 20 August 2018.

      v) The grant of permission by the FtT, dated 30 August 2018.

     vi) The respondent's response under rule  24,  dated  4  October  2018,
         stating the appellant's grounds for resisting  the  SSHD's  appeal,
         and grounds on which he was unsuccessful in the FtT, but  on  which
         he again relies.

 3. The grounds, in substance, disagree with the FtT's assessment  that  in
    terms of paragraph 399 (a) (ii) (b) of the immigration rules  it  would
    be unduly harsh for the child [D] to  remain  in  the  UK  without  the
    appellant. Having considered  the  submissions  of  both  sides,  I  am
    satisfied that nothing can be extracted from  the  grounds  which  goes
    beyond that disagreement.

 4. The FtT's conclusion was rationally open to it,  and  it  has  given  a
    legally adequate explanation, which is not shown to have  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

 5. The decision of the FtT shall stand.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
