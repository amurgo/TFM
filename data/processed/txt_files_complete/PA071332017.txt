For the Respondent:    Mr Hussain


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the 'respondent' and  the  respondent
    as the 'appellant', as they appeared respectively before the First-tier
    Tribunal. The appellant was born in 1985 and is a male citizen  of  Sri
    Lanka. On 22  July  2015,  the  appellant  was  sentenced  to  5  years
    imprisonment following  conviction  robbery.  His  asylum/human  rights
    claim was refused by the Secretary of State on 20 September  2016.  The
    appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  which,  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 7 August 2019, allowed the appeal on asylum and  Article
    3 ECHR grounds. The Secretary of State now appeals, with permission, to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. In addition to allowing the asylum appeal, the judge did not uphold the
    certification of the appellant's claim for asylum under section  72  of
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The  judge  was  satisfied
    that the appellant had rebutted the presumption that he  constitutes  a
    danger to the community. He found the serious  offence  was  'old'  and
    that the appellant only offered a medium risk of serious harm.

 3. Judge accepted that the appellant had been  detained  and  tortured  on
    account of his association with the LTTE whilst living  in  Sri  Lanka.
    The judge refers at length to the relevant  case  law  (GJ  and  others
    (post-civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG  [2013]  UKUT  319  (IAC)  and
    concluded there is a real risk that the appellant would be  exposed  to
    further ill-treatment upon return.

 4. The grounds of appeal challenge  the  decision  regarding  rebuttal  of
    section 72 and the findings on risk on return. The grounds rely on I  v
    Sweden  [2013]  ECHR  813  as  authority  for  the  requirement   that,
    notwithstanding past ill-treatment, 'substantial concrete  grounds  for
    believing that upon return to the home  country'  an  asylum  appellant
    would be 'exposed to a risk of such [ill] treatment again'  had  to  be
    established on the evidence. The respondent submits that fact that  the
    appellant has not  been  involved  in  any  sur  place  anti-government
    activities in the United Kingdom and does not fall into the category of
    a person posing a  destabilising  threat  to  post-conflict  Sri  Lanka
    indicates that there were insufficient grounds for the  judge  to  find
    that the appellant faces a real risk on return.

 5. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  devotes  9  ï¿½  pages  to  an
    exposition of the law and  quotations  from  background  material.  The
    findings of fact occupy a little over one  page  and  the  analysis  of
    those findings three relatively short paragraphs.  It  is,  of  course,
    important for the Tribunal to provide full  account  of  the  law  upon
    which its decision is to be based but here I consider the  analysis  to
    be  somewhat  brusque;  the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  uses  the
    expression 'one dimensional', a description with which I  would  agree.
    The judge accepts the entirety of the  account  given  to  him  by  the
    appellant but his findings have more of the  character  of  assertions;
    for example, at  [55],  the  judge  asserts  that  'all  of  this  [the
    appellant's account of past events] is entirely  plausible,  reasonably
    consistent and is supported by the general  country  evidence...'  That
    assertion is not supported by further reasoning.  The  judge  does  not
    explain what he means by 'reasonably' consistent evidence.

 6. In my opinion, the judge's rather brisk approach to the analysis of the
    evidence has led him into error. I agree with the respondent  that  the
    judge has done no more than find  that  the  appellant  was  previously
    detained and tortured in Sri Lanka and as has then  concluded  that  he
    will suffer similar treatment and return. Even on the  basis  that  the
    judge accepted the appellant's account of past events, he still  needed
    to make a more nuanced assessment of the risk on  return,  considering,
    for example, the lack of sur place activity.

 7. Moreover, whilst Mr Hussain submitted that the appellant  now  accepted
    his guilt of the robbery offence, he told the First-tier Tribunal judge
    [17] that he still considered himself innocent. The judge did not refer
    to the appellant's continued denial of guilt at [25] when he found that
    the section 72 was rebutted. Further, the judge's observation that  the
    offence was, by July 2019, 'old' is strange given  that  the  appellant
    had only been convicted less than four years earlier.

 8. In the light of what I say above, I have decided to set aside the First-
    tier Tribunal decision. None of the findings of fact shall  stand.  The
    appeal will be returned to the First-tier Tribunal for that Tribunal to
    remake the decision following a hearing de novo.



    Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside.  None  of  the
    finding of facts shall stand. The appeal is returned to the  First-tier
    Tribunal for that Tribunal to remake the decision.

Signed                              Date 2 November 2019
