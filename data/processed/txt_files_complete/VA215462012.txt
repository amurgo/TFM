                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Law promulgated on 8th March  2013  following  a  hearing  at
        Manchester Piccadilly. Permission to appeal was granted and it  was
        conceded before me that the Judge had made a material error of  law
        for the reasons set out in the application for permission to appeal
        and the grant of permission, such that the  determination  must  be
        set aside.  The  parties  were  in  a  position  to  proceed  to  a
        substantive hearing to allow me to substitute a decision to  either
        allow or dismiss the appeal.



Background


     2. The appellant was born on 11th November 1981 and is  a  citizen  of
        Pakistan. He applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom for  the
        purposes of a family visit which was refused by the  respondent  on
        21st May  2012  as  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  was  not
        satisfied that he had shown that only a short visit was intended or
        that he intended to leave the United Kingdom  at  the  end  of  the
        period stated - paragraph 41 (i) and (ii) of the Immigration Rules.
        The decision was upheld by the Entry  Clearance  Manager  (ECM)  on
        review.


     3. The basis for this finding was that the appellant  had  claimed  he
        was self-employed running a fruit and vegetable stall from which he
        received  a  monthly  income  equivalent  to   �138.    Two   trade
        association letters were found to carry little evidential value  as
        they can be easily prepared on  request  with  no  requirement  for
        there to be any supporting  documents.   Bank  statements  provided
        covering the period 1st November 2011 to  20th  April  2012  showed
        deposits equating to a total of �484 being paid into  the  account.
        This demonstrated a sum equal to three and  a  half  months  income
        being paid into the account during a six-month  period.   The  last
        credit was noted to be on  15th  February  2012  and  it  was  not,
        therefore, accepted as  adequate  evidence  confirming  his  stated
        income.


     4. The appellant claimed in the application form that his  father  was
        to cover the cost of travel to the UK and any  other  costs  during
        the six-week visit and evidence of this was provided in the form of
        a copy of his father's bank statement, although the closing balance
        was only said to be equivalent to �259 which was not  found  to  be
        enough to cover the cost of flights to the United Kingdom and other
        costs associated with the visit.


     5. The appellant is married with four children and it  was  not  found
        credible he would go to the UK for six weeks leaving the family  in
        Pakistan with no evidence of how they will cover their  own  living
        costs. The ECO was not satisfied that the  evidence  provided  with
        the application confirmed that his financial circumstances were  as
        he claimed them to be or that he is settled with  established  ties
        to Pakistan.




The evidence



     6. A bundle of documents has been provided in addition  to  which  the
        Tribunal heard  oral  evidence  from  the  appellant's  brother  Mr
        Zaboor. All the documentary evidence has been considered in detail.


     7. In his oral evidence Mr Zaboor confirmed the content of his witness
        statement is true.  In relation to the payment of tax  in  Pakistan
        he claims the appellant pays no tax on his income as  he  does  not
        earn enough income to pay tax.  He alleged the tax office told  the
        appellant he did not have to pay tax.


     8. He confirmed that his father had  previously  come  to  the  United
        Kingdom and returned as had another brother.  He stated there is no
        reason why this brother would remain  as  all  his  family  are  in
        Pakistan and he did not want to spoil his own record by  sponsoring
        somebody who would not return.


     9. I shall refer to elements arising out of cross examination  further
        below.



Discussion



    10.  In  Mohamed  Ali  (TH/13048/86)  the  Tribunal  said  that  simple
        suspicion, itself, is not enough to undermine the credibility of an
        application but the cumulative effect of a series of matters,  each
        only suspicious, may give rise to more than  "mere  suspicion".  In
        this appeal the ECO has raised a number of issues  giving  rise  to
        such concerns.


    11. In the  appellant's  application  form  he  stated  at  part  five,
        relating to employment  and  finances,  that  he  sells  fruit  and
        vegetables in a shop which he started  on  1st  January  2005.   He
        claims to earn a net income of between 15,000 to  20,000  Rupees  a
        month. In his oral evidence the appellant's  brother  claimed  that
        the shop has been open since 2009, not 2005. When this  discrepancy
        was pointed out to him he claimed there has been a misunderstanding
        by the person  who  completed  form.   I  note  that  an  agent  or
        representative is named in the form  but  the  declaration  on  the
        application form has been signed confirming that the content of the
        same is true. In addition a further document headed "To whom it may
        concern"  written  by  a  Pervaiz  Iqbal,  identifies  that   named
        individual as the person who completed the online visa  application
        form. He states: "Mistakenly I have written  his  jobs  start  date
        2005 instead of 2008. I apologies for this  mistake  made  by  me".
        The difficulty with this statement is that a third  date  is  being
        provided for when the appellant allegedly  started  his  fruit  and
        vegetable business. We now have 2005, 2008 and 2009.


    12. The application form states that the appellant's father is  to  pay
        the cost of travelling to the United Kingdom  and  also  for  other
        parts of  the  visit.  The  ECO  was  concerned  that  insufficient
        evidence was provided to show  that  the  father  could  meet  such
        costs. This element of the claim has not been substantiated on  the
        evidence either.  I note the sponsor stated he will assist  but  at
        the date of decision the situation is as noted above.


    13. In relation to the appellant's income, the issue arose  during  the
        hearing as to whether he was paying any tax on his income  and,  if
        so,  why  there  was  no  evidence  from  the  tax  authorities  to
        corroborate tax paid or a calculation showing the  income  declared
        to the tax authorities.  The sponsor's reply to a  question  asking
        why there was no evidence regarding the claim his brother  did  not
        pay tax was that he did not know much about this. Matters  relating
        to claims arising regarding income tax were  of  concern  to  Judge
        Thornton who heard an earlier  appeal  in  2007  with  case  number
        VA/30006/2006. In paragraph  10  of  the  determination  the  Judge
        notes:


              11. I note that the letterhead is not printed but  has  simply
   been typed on                A4 paper and that it reads  'OFFICE  OF  THE
   DEPUTY                           COMMISSIONER  INCOME  TAXBUSINESS  (sic)
   CIRCLE MIRPUR'.                  As Mr McBurnie pointed out, there is  no
   spacing between  the  words                  'tax'  and  'business'.   In
   addition, not only is  there  no  contact  number                    but,
   although there is a signature, it is illegible  and  there  is  no  name.
          I also note that the letter does not state the appellant's  income
   or                  even what tax he pays.


    14.  Although  it  was  submitted  on  the  appellant's   behalf   that
        agricultural  income  is  not   taxed,   there   is   no   document
        corroborating the  sponsor's  claim  that  other  income  does  not
        attract any tax liability.  In light of the production of  what  is
        clearly a document on which no weight may  be  placed  in  previous
        proceedings, statements made in relation to this appellant need  to
        be treated with  appropriate  care  when  considering  what  weight
        should be given to them.


    15. The ECO was concerned that the evidence  did  not  confirm  to  the
        required standard that the level of income claimed by  the  sponsor
        was available to him. This still remains  the  position.  There  is
        also the additional aspect raised by Ms  Pettersen  in  submissions
        that  in  the  previous  determination  in  which  Judge   Thornton
        dismissed the earlier appeal against  refusal  of  entry  clearance
        made on a similar basis to this one, it was found the appellant had
        not provided evidence in relation to his complete business such  as
        profit and loss trading  bank  accounts  or  bank  statements.  The
        current refusal appears to be very similar to the earlier  one  and
        so the appellant was fully aware of the nature of the  evidence  he
        was required to produce yet again failed to do so.


    16. Notwithstanding  what  had  been  said  by  the  sponsor  there  is
        inadequate proof of the business income and  insufficient  evidence
        to allay the concerns of  the  ECO.  The  bank  statements  do  not
        corroborate the alleged level  of  income  and  there  are,  again,
        insufficient accounts or other financial documents which  may  have
        been of assistance. There was no plausible explanation for the lack
        of evidence or any reason why it  could  not  be  produced,  if  it
        existed.


    17. I note Mr Saleem's submission that payments are made in cash in the
        business and  not  placed  into  the  bank  account  and  that  the
        sponsor's evidence and the photographs show the  business  existed.
        There  are  originals  of  receipts  and  letters  from  the  trade
        association and if  intention  is  in  issue,  the  civil  standard
        applies.  It was submitted there was enough evidence in the  bundle
        to show that the appellant's circumstances are as claimed.


    18. Mr Saleem is correct to  state  that  the  standard  is  the  civil
        standard, namely on the balance of  probabilities,  but  that  same
        standard applies to the appellant. Although  the  sponsor  did  his
        best to assist his brother, both in 2007 and in  relation  to  this
        application, similar issues  have  arisen  -  namely  the  lack  of
        evidence to prove that what the appellant states with regard to his
        financial and personal circumstances is true.


    19. It is not disputed that the appellant is married with children  but
        what is not proved is that he is telling the truth in  relation  to
        other material issues. The lack of evidence regarding his  father's
        resources is also another factor and it is  clear  that  inaccurate
        information has been provided in the application form  relating  to
        the date when the business was started.


    20. The stock purchase invoices and translated documents together  with
        photographs of the appellant sitting and standing in a shop are  of
        little probative value as the evidence provided  does  not  support
        what he stated with regard to the income from the business.


    21. I am not satisfied, having considered all  elements  of  the  claim
        carefully, that I can put the weight upon the evidence I  am  being
        invited to by Mr Saleem. I find, therefore, that the appellant  has
        failed to discharge the burden of proof upon him  to  the  required
        standard to show that his circumstances are as he claims them to be
        and accordingly the appeal  must  be  dismissed.   It  is  for  the
        appellant to establish that the source of funds in his  account  is
        as he claims and  to  provide  sufficient  evidence  regarding  the
        income position of his father to establish the source of  funds  in
        his account and their availability to fund  the  appellant  on  the
        visit as alleged.


    22. The appeal under the Immigration Rules is dismissed. Article 8 ECHR
        was not raised but if it was my finding would be that the  decision
        was  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  relied  upon  by  the
        Secretary of State on the basis of the facts as found.


Decision

    23. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.




   Anonymity.


    24. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order.
