                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of India who came to the United Kingdom on
      9 February 2011 as a student. He was subsequently granted further
      leave outside the rules until 1 June 2013. He was then granted leave
      as a spouse of a British citizen, Mrs Ashwarthy Ashwarthy from 15 July
      2013 to 15th January 2016.On 23 December 2015 he applied for leave to
      remain as a spouse. This was refused on 19 March 2016 and the refusal
      was maintained on 27 March 2017 following a reconsideration.


   2. His application was considered under appendix FM and refused on
      suitability grounds. This was on the basis that when he applied for
      further leave as a student he submitted an English language test
      result as part of the requirement. The respondent concluded that the
      test had been taken by a proxy. The respondent did accept that he was
      in a genuine and subsisting relationship with his wife. She was
      originally from India and they both spoke English and Hindu. He had
      not been in the United Kingdom a particularly long time and it was
      felt that they both could live there and enjoy family life. There were
      also family members there. The couple had no children. No other
      exceptional circumstances were identified justifying the grant of
      leave.

   3. The grounds of appeal state that the appellant came to the United
      Kingdom to study for a Master's degree in pharmaceutical science at
      the London Metropolitan University. He met his wife in 2012 and they
      married in May 2013. The grounds referred to the decision of Qadir -v-
      SSHD (IA/36319/2016). The grounds argue that the appellant has a
      command of English and had no need to cheat. Included with the grounds
      was a psychiatric report on his wife.

   4. Paragraph 56 of the Upper Tribunal decision in SM and Qadir v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department (ETS - Evidence - Burden of
      Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC) states:

           ... the Secretary of State, in all of these cases, is making the
           positive case that the student concerned dishonestly obtained
           the English language qualification by the use of a proxy test
           taker. Second, the Secretary of State seeks to make good this
           allegation to the requisite standard by adducing in evidence, in
           addition to the generic evidence noted above, a flimsy
           spreadsheet emanating from ETS which, in a single line,
           contains, in substance, only the name of the student concerned
           and the categorisation of either "questionable" or "invalid".

   5. The Upper Tribunal then referred to the decision of Shen (Paper
      Appeals: Proving Dishonesty) [2014] UKUT 236 (IAC), and the changing
      burdens of proof:

           (a) First, where the Secretary of State alleges that an
           applicant has practised dishonesty or deception in an
           application for leave to remain, there is an evidential burden
           on the Secretary of State. This requires that sufficient
           evidence be adduced to raise an issue as to the existence or non-
           existence of a fact in issue: for example, by producing the
           completed application which is prima facie deceitful in some
           material fashion.

           (b) The spotlight thereby switches to the applicant. If he
           discharges the burden - again, an evidential one - of raising an
           innocent explanation, namely an account which satisfies the
           minimum level of plausibility, a further transfer of the burden
           of proof occurs.

           (c) Where (b) is satisfied, the burden rests on the Secretary of
           State to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the
           Appellant's prima facie innocent explanation is to be rejected.

The First tier Tribunal

   6. His appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal NMK Lawrence
      sitting at Hatton Cross on 4 May 2018.  In a decision promulgated on
      23 May 2018 it was dismissed.


   7. The respondent had accepted that he was in a genuine and subsisting
      relationship with his wife. The view was that family life could
      continue outside the United Kingdom. The appellant had provided a
      psychiatric report which indicated that his wife was suffering from
      depression. The judge did not see her medical condition breaching the
      high threshold of article 3 judge took the view was treatment
      available in India. The appellant's wife is originally from India and
      became a British citizen in July 2012.

   8. Regarding private life and paragraph 276 ADE, the judge concluded that
      they were both familiar was Indian culture, language and lifestyle and
      returning would not amount to a very significant obstacle.

   9. The judge then went on to consider the public interest factors set out
      in section 117 B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.
      It was accepted that the appellant spoke English but was not
      economically active. Furthermore, his private life and family life had
      been established whilst this time here had been precarious.

  10. The refusal of his claim under appendix FM of the rules was on the
      basis of suitability. The judge recorded that appellant's
      representative had accepted the respondent had discharged the burden
      of proof is to raise the issue of dishonesty on the part of the
      appellant. It was then him to dispel this. The appellant said that he
      spoke good English and had passed previous examinations in English and
      did not need to use a proxy test taker. The judge was not impressed by
      this and took the view that this amounted to mere rhetoric.

  11. The only analysis of the appellant's explanation is at paragraph 7 of
      the decision. The application for permission to appeal sets out at
      paragraph 11 the claims made by the appellant about taking the test.
      This included describing the test centre, how he got there and the
      subsequent visit to the test centre seeking an explanation from the
      college. In themselves such factors may or may not address concerns.
      For instance, a person may well have knowledge of English but for
      whatever reason resort to a proxy test taker. However, it is important
      for the judge to analyse and evaluate the explanation. It is my
      conclusion the judge has failed to do this.

  12. Ms Isherwood makes the point that the appellant has a restricted right
      of appeal which is concerned with his protected human rights. She said
      that the appellant's representatives have not challenged the judge's
      findings in relation to his article 8 rights. These included the fact
      his wife originated in India and the family could relocate there.
      However, the rules are meant to be article 8 compliant. The respondent
      had accepted the appellant's marriage was genuine and subsisting. But
      for the allegation of personation his application may well have
      succeeded. Consequently, although dealing with article 8 the judge's
      assessment is through the prism of the rules, including the question
      of the appellant suitability. It is my conclusion the judge materially
      erred in law by failing to set out and evaluate the appellant's claim
      in answer to the allegation.

Decision

The decision of first-tier Tribunal Judge NMK Lawrence materially errs in
law. The matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo
hearing.
