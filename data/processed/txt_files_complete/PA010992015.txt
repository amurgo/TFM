For the Respondent: Mr A Mc Vitie Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. The Appellant,  a  national  of  Libya  was  born  on  3  May  1974.  The
   Appellants wife  and  6  children  are  dependents  in  his  appeal.  The
   children's ages range from the youngest aged 3 to the oldest aged 15.
3. The Appellant appealed against the decision of  the  Secretary  of  State
   dated 2 September 2015 to refuse to grant a protection claim and.  First-
   tier Tribunal Judge  Heynes  refused  the  appeal  on  all  grounds.  The
   Respondent refused the application because it was not  accepted  that  he
   belonged to the Elshwidi Tribe and  would  be  targeted  on  return;  the
   Appellant was not in any risk categories of the then caselaw for risk  on
   return; the Appellants claim for asylum was not made promptly; there  was
   no other basis for a grant of leave.
4. The Appellant appealed the decision  and  his  appeal  was  dismissed  by
   First-tier Tribunal Judge Heynes. At an error of law hearing on 20  March
   2017 I set aside that decision on the basis that his assessment  of  risk
   as to whether having conceded  that  there  was  such  a  high  level  of
   indiscriminate violence in Benghazi, within the meaning of Article  15(c)
   of Council Directive 2004/83/EC ("the Qualification Directive") so as  to
   mean that substantial grounds existed for believing  that  an  individual
   would, solely by being present there, face a real  risk  which  threatens
   his or her life or  person  relocation  to  Tripoli  was  reasonable  and
   whether such conditions existed  in  Tripoli.  All  other  findings  were
   preserved. The matter was adjourned to enable the parties to gather  more
   up to date material.
5. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as they were  in
   the First-tier Tribunal.
6. Mr Mc Vitie on behalf of the Respondent relied on the refusal letter  and
   Mr Chaudhury relied on his bundle of documents.
The Law and Background Material
7. The Appellant bears the burden of proving that Article 15(c)  is  engaged
   by the decision. Article 15(c)  of  Council  Directive  2004/83/EC  ("the
   Qualification Directive") defines serious harm within the Directive as:


             "serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or  person
             by  reason  of  indiscriminate  violence  in   situations   of
             international or internal armed conflict."

8. The Court of Justice of the European  Union  ("CJEU")  gave  judgment  in
   Diakitï¿½ (Case C-285/12) in which it was held that:


             "on a  proper  construction  of  Article  15(c)  of  Directive
             2004/83, it  must  be  acknowledged  that  an  internal  armed
             conflict exists, for the purposes of applying that  provision,
             if a State's armed forces confront one or more armed groups or
             if two or more armed groups confront each  other.  It  is  not
             necessary for  that  conflict  to  be  categorised  as  'armed
             conflict   not   of   an   international   character'    under
             international humanitarian law; nor is it necessary  to  carry
             out, in addition to an appraisal  of  the  level  of  violence
             present in the territory concerned, a separate  assessment  of
             the intensity  of  the  armed  confrontations,  the  level  of
             organisation of the armed forces involved or the  duration  of
             the conflict."
9. The CJEU has highlighted the 'exceptional situation' needed  for  Article
   15(c) to apply to civilians generally. In  Elgafaji  v.  Staatssecretaris
   van Justitie, C-465/07 at paragraph 37, the Court made clear  that,  for
   this to be the case-
             '[...] the degree of  indiscriminate  violence  characterising
             the armed conflict taking place ... [must reach] such  a  high
             level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that  a
             civilian, returned to the relevant country or, as the case may
             be, to the relevant region, would, solely on  account  of  his
             presence on the territory of that country or  region,  face  a
             real risk of being subject to the serious threat  referred  in
             Article 15(c) of the Directive.'
10. The level of violence has to be assessed by its quantity as well  as  by
   its quality. There can  be  no  doubt  that  a  substantial  quantity  of
   violence is a necessity without which subsidiary protection shall not  be
   granted. However, defining the threshold of Article 15(c) is not a simple
   matter of analysing  quantitative  data.  Three  principles  govern  this
   assessment:
     a. First, the approach must be  holistic  and  inclusive.  Courts  and
        Tribunals  must  take  into  account  a  wide  range  of   relevant
        variables.
     b. Second, Courts and Tribunals  should  not  limit  themselves  to  a
        purely quantitative analysis  of  figures  of  civilian  death  and
        injuries  etc.  The  approach  must  be  qualitative  as  well   as
        quantitative. When  assessing  quantity  and  quality,  courts  and
        tribunals  should  bear  in  mind  the  likelihood  of   unreported
        incidents and other uncertainties.
     c. Third, building on the case law, Courts and Tribunals  should  look
        in  particular  to  see  what  the  evidence  tells  us  about  the
        indicators of situations of violence and conflict (the following is
        intended as a non-exhaustive list):
           i. The ECHR 'Sufi and Elmi  criteria':  -  the  parties  to  the
              conflict and their relative  military  strengths  and  regard
              should be had to methods and tactics of warfare applied (risk
              of  civilian  casualties);  type   of   weapons   used;   the
              geographical scope of the fighting (localised or  widespread)
              and the number of civilians killed, injured and displaced  as
              a result of the fighting.
          ii. The ability or lack  of  it  by  the  State  to  protect  its
              citizens against violence (where practicable, it will  assist
              to set out the various potential actors of protection and  to
              address their actual role/the degree of State failure).
         iii. Socio-economic conditions (which should include assessment of
              economic and  other  forms  of  assistance  by  international
              organisations and NGOs).
          iv. Cumulative effects of long lasting armed conflicts.

11. In relation to Article 15(c) in FA (Libya: art 15(c))  Libya  CG  [2016]
   UKUT 413 (IAC) at paragraph 11 it states:


   "In fact, as it seems to us, there have been numerous  changes  in  Libya
   since November 2013, and that they are sufficient  to  render  unreliable
   the guidance on art 15(c) given in AT.  Amongst  those  changes  are  the
   cessation of direct flights from the United Kingdom, the ebb and flow  of
   fighting in Libya, the rise of Daesh, and the issue of  numerous  reports
   and advice, not least by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  It may  be
   that some of this evidence, the last in particular, would not  by  itself
   throw any real doubt on the accuracy of the assessments in  AT,  but  the
   evidence taken as a whole leads us to say  that  the  Tribunal  needs  to
   undertake a new analysis of the art 15(c) risk"
12. In the CIG dated January 2017 at 2.3.8 and 2.3.21 it is acknowledged
   that the individual characteristics of the Appellant must be examined in
   order to determine if there are additional risk factors and vulnerable
   groups include children and those with disabilities. I also note that in
   the UKBA Document(publicly accessible) headed Humanitarian Protection
   dated 2013 at Section 4 in relation to Article 15(c) it states:


   "The sliding scale/enhanced risk categories If applicants do not meet the
   above tests, they may also be applied on a sliding scale. That is to say,
   the more the applicant is able to show that he  or  she  is  specifically
   affected by factors particular to  his  personal  circumstances  (e.g.  a
   child  or  someone  of  advanced  age,  disability,  gender,  ill-health,
   ethnicity or, for example, by virtue of being a  perceived  collaborator,
   medical professional, teacher or  government  official),  the  lower  the
   level of indiscriminate violence required for him to be eligible. "
Findings

13. I have looked at the evidence in the round taking into  account  all  of
   the evidence both oral and written whether I refer to it specifically  or
   not.  The refusal letter relies on the decision in AT  which  is  clearly
   out of date. No other up to  date  material  has  been  provided  by  the
   Respondent although they have clearly Hd an opportunity to produce it.  I
   took into account the material provided in the Appellants bundle but I am
   satisfied that his case is in fact largely made out on the basis  of  the
   Respondents own material set out in the most recent CIG provided  by  the
   Appellant. the light of my analysis of the evidence I make the  following
   findings.


14.  The  difficulty  in  making  the  assessment  in  this  case   is   the
   acknowledged volatility of the situation in Libya.  The  decision  in  FA
   makes plain that AT is no longer good law in so far as it relates to  the
   security situation and I must consider each case based on the  background
   material produced and the  individual  circumstances  of  the  Appellant.
   Humanitarian conditions  in  Libya  it  is  accepted  have  continued  to
   deteriorate since the fall of former President Gaddafi in 2011. There has
   been extensive  damage  to  civilian  homes  and  public  infrastructure,
   including  health,  education,  roads  and   administrative   facilities,
   severely disrupting  basic  services  including  the  provision  of  safe
   drinking water, gas and electricity. There are large numbers of IDPs. The
   Respondent acknowledges that the  Appellant  and  his  family  could  not
   safely return to Benghazi their hometown but the refusal letter  suggests
   that they could reasonably relocate to Tripoli.


15. The latest policy summary by the Respondent therefore puts the  case  in
   relation to Article 15(c) in this way:

   "3.1.4 However, in general, the humanitarian conditions are not at such a
   level as to make return a breach  of  Article  15  of  the  Qualification
   Directive but may  do  so  in  relation  to  some  persons,  particularly
   vulnerable people, e.g. displaced,  female-headed  households,  children,
   persons with disabilities and the chronically ill.

   3.1.5 In general the security situation across Libya is not such  that  a
   person would, solely by being present  there,  face  a  real  risk  which
   threatens his or her life by reason of  indiscriminate  violence.   There
   may be particular factors relating to the individual's circumstances that
   nevertheless place them at risk.  Each case must  be  considered  on  its
   individual facts and merits."

16. I must therefore consider on the basis of all  the  material  before  me
   including any factors that may be personal to the Appellant is there such
   a high level of indiscriminate violence in Libya, within the  meaning  of
   Article  15(c)  of  Council  Directive  2004/83/EC  ("the   Qualification
   Directive") so as to mean that substantial grounds  exist  for  believing
   that an individual would, solely by being present there, face a real risk
   which threatens his or her life or person.

17. The material in the Respondents latest CIG argues that at 0.025% of  the
   overall populations the deaths in Libya do  not  disclose  a  generalised
   risk of violence and indeed the figure quoted is in accordance  with  the
   figure given in November 2015 to the  UN  Security  Council  (9.2.1)  and
   would therefore not suggest an  escalation  of  the  levels  of  violence
   either generally or specifically in Tripoli. Indeed, the CIG argues  that
   Tripoli is less violent (2.3.19) and that while the  number  of  civilian
   deaths remains unacceptably high they are focused in other areas  of  the
   country particularly Benghazi, Sirte and Derna  (9.2.2)  However  I  note
   that it concludes that the  trend  of  the  figures  paints  a  different
   picture in that at 9.3.8 it states:

   "The levels of violence documented by ACLED in 2016 are similar  to  2015
   for Benghazi, Darnah, and Surt. However Tripoli is on course,  if  levels
   of violence remain constant for the remainder  of  the  year,  to  almost
   double its number of fatalities compared to  2015,  albeit  from  a  much
   lower base line compared to the other cities."

18.   I take into account that again the Respondents  own  CIG  acknowledges
   the use imprecise weaponry in densely-populated residential areas in what
   often amounted to indiscriminate attacks, leading to civilian  fatalities
   and damage to civilian infrastructure ( 9.1.2)

19.  In  making  that  assessment  in  relation  to  this  Appellant  it  is
   acknowledged that it is not safe for him and  his  family  to  return  to
   Benghazi as it accepted that the levels of violence there engage  Article
   15 (c). As to whether it would be reasonable for him and  his  family  to
   relocate to Tripoli I take into  account  that  he  was  originally  from
   Misrata and then worked in Benghazi. He has  no  family  or  other  close
   connections in Tripoli and originating from  Misrata  or  Benghazi  could
   potentially make him the subject of adverse  interest  within  a  triable
   society. I take into  account  that  while  the  Appellant  is  a  highly
   educated man he has never lived or worked in Tripoli and with the general
   breakdown of the Libyan  infrastructure  that  must  limit  the  ability,
   particularly of  an  outsider  in  a  largely  tribal  society,  to  gain
   employment.

20. I am also required to take into account the fact that the Appellant  has
   6 children under 15 and a wife and indeed this factor is referred  to  in
   the Respondents own policy documents as justifying a 'sliding  scale'  to
   the assessment of risk ('Humanitarian  Protection  2013').  The  material
   before me makes plain that both the humanitarian situation generally  and
   the violence puts women and children at a high risk (10.5.6).

21. The vulnerability of the  Appellant  and  his  family  is  significantly
   increased  because  the  Appellants  daughter  (DOB  22  May  2006)   has
   "significant   learning   difficulties,    social    and    communication
   difficulties,  high  anxiety  levels,  behavioural  difficulties   ...and
   epilepsy, which is controlled  by  medication.....  she  has  a  lack  of
   awareness of how to keep herself safe -road  safety,  strangers  etc  and
   this puts her at risk -she is a vulnerable  girl.'(page  1  supplementary
   bundle. She clearly has a wide range of needs that are currently  met  at
   the school she attends but it appears  that  stability  and  routine  are
   central to her continued improvement. I  note  in  the  material  in  the
   Appellants bundle both the impact of the fighting  and  unrest  on  adult
   hospitals but also on children's services. I note  in  the  UNHCR  report
   dated 11 January 2017 at page 68 'The high level  of behavioural  changes
   reported by parents,  is  a  clear  symptom  of  the  chronic  level  the
   situation of instability is reaching, which seems currently not addressed
   by the humanitarian community.'

22. There is  no  single  universally  recognised  stable  government  in  a
   position to protect the  citizens  of  Libya  from  the  impact  of  this
   internal armed conflict  either  in  relation  to  the  violence  or  the
   humanitarian needs that have arisen.

23. I am therefore satisfied that taking into account all  of  the  findings
   set out  above  and  applying  the  sliding  scale  referred  to  by  the
   Respondent to the Appellants own circumstances that it would be a  breach
   of Article 15(c) to require the Appellant and his family to  relocate  to
   Tripoli.

CONCLUSION

24. On the basis of the facts  found  in  this  appeal,  the  Appellant  has
   discharged the burden of proof on him to show that on his return he would
   face a real risk of suffering "serious harm" by  reference  to  paragraph
   339C of the Immigration Rules (as amended).


Decision


25. The appeal is allowed on humanitarian grounds.
