For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Graham, promulgated on  1  August  2018,  dismissing  on  human  rights
    grounds the appeal against  a  decision  of  the  Respondent  dated  29
    November 2017 refusing leave to remain in the United Kingdom.


2.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 15 May 1970.


3.   The Appellant has claimed that he entered the United Kingdom  in  1994.
    The Respondent's rehearsal of the Appellant's immigration  history  set
    out in the decision letter of 27 November 2017,  and  repeated  in  the
    cover sheet to the Respondent's bundle before the First-tier  Tribunal,
    states that the Appellant made an application for indefinite  leave  to
    remain on the basis of 'Long Residency (14 years)' on 4 December  2008,
    which was refused on 22 April 2009. The application that has led to the
    decision that is the subject of the appeal was an application for leave
    to remain - treated as a human rights claim - made on 17 June 2016.


4.   The application, made by way of form FLR(FP)  signed  on  8  June  2016
    (Respondent's bundle A1-A50) was based on private life  established  in
    the UK (A3 - see also covering letter dated 17 June 2016  at  D1).  The
    covering letter with the application dated 17 June 2016, drafted by the
    Appellant's solicitors, indicated  reliance  was  placed  on  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iii) of the  Immigration  Rules:  it  was  claimed  that  the
    Appellant had lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years.


5.   Reliance appears to have been placed  exclusively  on  private  life  -
    rather  than  family  life  -  notwithstanding  that  the   Appellant's
    supporting documents include a birth certificate for a son born  on  11
    January 2015  (C1)  and  a  daughter  born  on  18  January  2017  (C2)
    (Necessarily the daughter could not have featured  in  the  application
    when initially made because her birth post-dates  the  signing  of  the
    application form.) There is further reference to the  children  in  the
    context of correspondence between the Respondent  and  the  Appellant's
    solicitors (e.g. see D7, where, in a letter dated 12  April  2017,  the
    solicitors referred to the Appellant's child - in the singular - living
    with him. The Appellant offers an explanation for this circumstance  in
    a witness statement dated 8 May 2017 (F4).


6.   In his application the Appellant repeated his  claim  to  have  entered
    the UK in 1994 (A5, and see also A30-32)). He stated that  he  was  not
    working in the UK (A7), but that he  received  financial  support  from
    friends as and when required  (A9);  notwithstanding,  he  included  in
    support of his application purported evidence of past employment  (e.g.
    see list of documents at D1-D3). In this context  the  covering  letter
    stated: "It would not be out of place to mention that; [the  Appellant]
    has previously worked in the UK, in order to meet  his  daily  survival
    needs.... However; as instructed, for the  last  about  1  year  (since
    early 2015); [the Appellant] has been financially supported by  friends
    in the local community" (D3).


7.   The correspondence in the course of the  application  includes  letters
    from the Appellant's solicitors submitting further supporting documents
    including from HMRC. In this context the solicitors' letter of 26 April
    2017 (D8) refers to  "HMRC  employment/self-employment  record  of  the
    Applicant (alias Geoffrey Ernest Smith)". However, nothing  further  is
    stated in the letter by way of explanation as to the  supposed  use  of
    such an alias.


8.   The supporting documents included in the Respondent's bundle  at  Annex
    E include documents in the stylisation of names  'Ernest  Smith  Okuma'
    (E1, E2, E5-E10, E13, E14), 'E S Okuma' (E11,  E12,  E15-E18),  'Ernest
    Smith' (E3 and E4), and 'Geoffrey Ernest Smith' (E22).


9.   Further to this, National Insurance numbers appear as:  [TN  ~  B]  for
    Ernest Smith Okuma and E S Okuma; and [NS ~ B]  for  Ernest  Smith  and
    Geoffrey Ernest Smith. A  P60  in  the  name  Ernest  Smith  Okuma  for
    2005/2006 (reproduced at E1  and  E2  in  slightly  different  formats)
    contains no national insurance number.


10.  I also note the following. The bulk  of  the  employment  documentation
    submitted in the course of the  application  relates  to  the  identity
    'Ernest Smith Okuma' with the National Insurance number [TN ~ B].  Only
    two documents are in the  identity  Ernest  Smith,  both  carrying  the
    National Insurance number [NS ~ B].  These  documents  are  a  P60  for
    2004/2005 (E3), and a P45 showing a leaving date of 28 May  2004  (E4).
    However,  an  email  dated  6   April   2017   from   the   Appellant's
    representatives to HMRC seeking supporting evidence names their  client
    as Ernest Smith Okuma, but provides the National Insurance number  that
    appears on the documents in the name Ernest Smith (E20-21). The  letter
    refers to this as "Our client's national insurance number". The  letter
    also makes reference to National Insurance numbers [TN ~ B] and  [TN  ~
    M] on the basis that "We were also  advised  to  provide  our  client's
    temporary NI numbers".


11.  The response from HMRC by letter dated 24 April 2017  (E22)  is  headed
    'Re: GEOFFREY ERNEST SMITH', and does not  in  its  content  appear  to
    recognise  or  otherwise  engage  with  the  difference  in  name.  The
    information provided in the letter is limited to the  period  1997/1998
    to 2005/2006 pursuant to the terms of the request  in  the  solicitors'
    email.


12.  The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for reasons set  out
    in a 'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL') dated 27 November 2017. This
    letter in part treats the application as having been  based  on  family
    life with the Appellant's son, and also  acknowledges  the  Appellant's
    daughter who lives with her mother. The application  is  refused  under
    the so-called 'parent route'  under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, and also in respect of private  life;  the  decision-maker  also
    concludes that there are no exceptional circumstances  to  warrant  the
    grant of leave to remain outside the provisions of the Rules.


13.  In respect of the Appellant's claimed length of  residence  in  the  UK
    the RFRL states:

         "You therefore claim to have lived in the UK for 21 years but there
         are inconsistencies with the proof that you have provided and it is
         not accepted you have lived continuously in the UK for at least  20
         years. There is no evidence at all for 1997,  which  is  the  first
         year of your 20 year  period[1].  Other  evidence  is  provided  by
         various documents, but there are gaps in  1997  and  1999-2004,  as
         photocopies of P60s have been provided. It is  made  clear  in  the
         guidance provided that originals of documents must be provided  and
         photocopies are not acceptable. You have provided a statement  from
         HMRC from 1997 to 2006. This  statement  contradicts  the  evidence
         provided in your P60 for 1997/8, the P60 states you are employed by
         Seven Sisters Hospital Services Ltd and earn �7,205 gross. The HMRC
         statement shows no employer or benefit details for the same period.
         For 1998/9 you have provided a P60  from  Alpha  Security  Services
         (UK) Ltd declaring  Gross  Earnings  of  �7,452.50,  but  the  HMRC
         statement shows that you were employed by Manpower  plc  and  Xerox
         limited, and therefore this evidence is considered unreliable."


14.  It may be seen that there are  broadly  two  bases  for  rejecting  the
    Appellant's claim as to length of residence: that he failed to  provide
    original  documents;  and  that  there  were   discrepancies   in   the
    documentation provided. Although the Respondent's  decision-maker  does
    not expressly identify in terms that there was a different  stylisation
    of name as between, for example the P60s from  Seven  Sisters  Hospital
    (E13) and the Alpha Security (E10), and the HMRC  statement  (i.e.  the
    letter dated 24 April 2017 at E22), it is  adequately  clear  from  the
    RFRL that much  of  the  supporting  documentation  provided  with  the
    application prior to the later provision of the HMRC document  did  not
    match the information in the HMRC document. Perusal  of  the  documents
    makes it clear that the discrepancies identified in the RFRL  are  only
    examples: none of the employers mentioned in the  HMRC  document  match
    the employment details provided in the identity Ernest Smith Okuma; the
    self-employed national insurance contributions identified in  the  HMRC
    document are not reconcilable with the absence of any  claim  of  self-
    employment or any self-employment documents in the application.


15.  In short, the record of employment of 'Geoffrey Ernest Smith' shown  in
    the HMRC documents did not match the record of  employment  of  'Ernest
    Smith Okuma' demonstrated in the various employment documents submitted
    in that name, notwithstanding that there was an overlap in the  periods
    shown.


16.  The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


17.  In the Grounds of Appeal (reproduced in the Appellant's  bundle  before
    the First-tier Tribunal at  pages  13-15),  amongst  other  things  the
    Appellant  admitted  to  using  Geoffrey  Ernest  Smith  as  an   alias
    (paragraph 2.3), and also  "being  an  overstayer...  [using]  multiple
    national insurance numbers" (paragraph 2.4).  Moreover,  the  Appellant
    placed particular reliance upon the HMRC document: "In any  event,  the
    official documentation provided by HMRC is sufficient to establish  the
    Appellant's  residence  in  the  UK  during  the  period  in  question"
    (paragraph 2.5).


18.  In his witness statement before the First-tier  Tribunal  signed  on  4
    June 2018 (Appellant's bundle before the First-tier Tribunal  at  pages
    16-19) the Appellant in substance repeated the contents of the  Grounds
    of Appeal: see witness statement at paragraph 7.5: "... the  employment
    record contained in the HMRC statement reflects the additional  jobs  I
    undertook using alias Geoffrey Ernest Smith". However, no  attempt  was
    made in the witness statement to explain why such employment overlapped
    with employment in the identity of Ernest Smith Okuma, or otherwise why
    such  employment  in  part  post-dated  the  obtaining  of  a  National
    Insurance number in the identity of Ernest Smith  Okuma.  Moreover,  no
    attempt was made to  reconcile  what  might  otherwise  be  seen  as  a
    conflict in respect of the number and type of employments held  at  any
    one time, and nothing is stated in respect of  how  the  Appellant  had
    been able  to  assume  such  an  alias  (including  obtaining  official
    recognition by way of a National Insurance number).


19.  The First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  for  the
    reasons set out in the Decision promulgated on 1 August 2018.


20.  The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  which
    was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Blundell on 2 January 2019.


Challenge and Discussion

21.   The  Appellant's  Grounds  of  Appeal  submitted  in  support  of  the
    application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal pleaded  two
    bases of challenge: a failure to have regard to material evidence,  and
    unfair procedure.


22.  The first basis of challenge submits that the Judge  was  in  error  in
    stating at paragraph 14 of the Decision that the Appellant had  "failed
    to submit documents" in the name of his claimed alias  Geoffrey  Ernest
    Smith. It is pleaded that the Judge was "factually  incorrect"  because
    the Appellant had submitted the HMRC document dated 24 April 2017  (E22
    of the  Respondent's  bundle).  The  Grounds  plead  "It  is  therefore
    arguable that the FTJ failed to have regard to material evidence before
    her which was crucial to the  Appellant's  case,  particularly  to  the
    continuous 20 years long residence". (See Grounds at paragraph 3.)


23.  Also pleaded under the first head of challenge  is  a  submission  that
    the Judge was wrongly critical of the Appellant's  failure  to  provide
    original documentation for 1999-2004 in circumstances where it was  his
    case  that  such  documents  had  previously  been  presented  to   the
    Respondent in the course of his earlier application and  the  originals
    not returned (Grounds at paragraph 4).


24.  The second head of challenge - unfair procedure -  seems  in  substance
    for the most part to repeat the allegations of the second limb  of  the
    first head under a different guise. It is argued that the Judge  failed
    to have proper regard  to  documents  covering  the  period  1999-2004,
    specifying pages 30-71 of the Appellant's bundle before the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Many of the documents at  those  pages  are  the  photocopied
    documents that are the subject of the previous ground; some are in  the
    identity  of  the  supposed  alias;  however,  there  are  additionally
    purported tenancy documents, and letters from BT to 'Mr S Ernest'.


25.  In material part the grant of permission to appeal is in the  following
    terms:

         "[The Appellant] maintained before Judge Graham that  he  had  used
         the alias Geoffrey Ernest Smith in order to work unlawfully in  the
         UK. Judge Graham found, inter-alia, that there was no  evidence  in
         the name of Geoffrey Ernest Smith and that there was no evidence to
         show that he and the appellant were one and the same person.

         It is certainly arguable that the former of  the  findings  I  have
         summarised  immediately  above  was  in  error.  An  HMRC  document
         addressed to Geoffrey Ernest Smith  appears  at  page  E22  in  the
         respondent's bundle and there is also an HMRC letter  for  the  tax
         year 2016-2017 loose in the file, bearing not only  that  name  but
         also the appellant's current address.... If Judge Graham did err in
         this respect, it will  be  for  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  determine
         whether any such error was material in light, in particular, of the
         second finding I have summarised above.


         The remaining grounds are less impressive but I grant permission on
         all grounds."


26.  Reading the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as a  whole,  it  seems
    to me that it cannot sustainably be contended that the Judge overlooked
    or otherwise disregarded the HMRC letter of 24 April 2017.  The  Judge,
    by accurately paraphrasing them, demonstrated a  familiarity  with  the
    contents of the RFRL - which were both informed  by,  and  made  cross-
    reference to, the HMRC letter: see in particular the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal at paragraph 4(i). That the Judge was alert to  the
    HMRC letter is made yet more overt at paragraph 12:


         "In his oral evidence the appellant accepted that  he  had  use  an
         alias and a second National Insurance number  which  explained  why
         the HMRC records and the other documents submitted did not match".


27.  As adverted  to  in  the  grant  of  permission  to  appeal,  the  real
    difficulty for the Appellant was not that he had not submitted evidence
    from HMRC but that - on the Judge's findings - he had not shown that he
    was the person who had undertaken the  employment  to  which  the  HMRC
    record related.


28.  In this context the  Judge  observed  that  the  Appellant  "could  not
    explain how he obtained documents in the name of Geoffrey Ernest  Smith
    in order to satisfy HMRC and be  given  a  National  Insurance  number"
    (paragraph 12). The Judge  also  noted  the  use  of  the  stylisations
    'Ernest Smith' and 'Mr S Ernest', in addition to 'Ernest Smith  Okuma'.
    Unsurprisingly,  the  Judge  found   these   matters   undermined   the
    Appellant's credibility. In my judgement in such circumstances  it  was
    open to the Judge to find:

         "As the appellant is unable to provide any evidence  to  show  that
         he, Geoffrey Ernest Smith and Ernest Smith  are  the  same  person,
         therefore I am  unable  to  accept  documents  in  these  names  as
         evidence of the appellant's residence in the UK" (paragraph 14).


29.  Indeed, the Grounds of Appeal do not  actually  mount  a  challenge  to
    that crucial finding of the First-tier Tribunal Judge. In my  judgement
    that is ultimately fatal to the challenge raised.


30.  Be that as it may, the Judge's phrasing at the first  bullet  point  of
    paragraph 13 - "There  are  no  documents  submitted  in  the  name  of
    Geoffrey Ernest Smith" - relates to the  contents  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle. The Appellant's bundle did not  contain  a  copy  of  the  HMRC
    letter of 24 April 2017,  and  to  this  extent  this  passage  in  the
    decision does not support the contention in the Grounds that the  Judge
    overlooked or disregarded the HMRC letter. I accept  that  the  Judge's
    phrasing at paragraph 14 - "He admits to using the  alias  of  Geoffrey
    Ernest Smith but has failed to submit documents in this name" - is  not
    obviously confined to the contents of the Appellant's bundle.  However,
    bearing in mind that it is otherwise clear that the Judge was alert  to
    the HMRC document, it seems to me that in context what  the  Judge  was
    saying in such passages was that the Appellant  failed  to  submit  any
    documents that connected him to the identity of Geoffrey Ernest Smith.


31.  The grant of permission to appeal identifies a further document  "loose
    in the file", being an HMRC annual tax summary  in  the  name  Geoffrey
    Ernest Smith for  the  tax  year  2016/2017.  (This  document  was  not
    mentioned and was not the subject of  any  express  submission  in  the
    grounds in support of the application for permission to appeal.)


32.  Mr Jesurum argued that irrespective of whether or not the Judge had  in
    substance demonstrated awareness of, and/or had  otherwise  taken  into
    account, the HMRC letter of 24 April 2017, plainly there was  no  overt
    reference to the 2016/2017 document, and  it  could  not  otherwise  be
    inferred that the Judge had taken it into account.


33.  That may be so, but I  am  not  persuaded  that  this  is  in  any  way
    material. The finding that the  Judge  made  to  the  effect  that  the
    Appellant had not demonstrated that he was connected to,  or  had  ever
    been employed in, the identity of Geoffrey Ernest Smith applies just as
    much to this document:  this  document  does  not  advance  any  better
    evidence of any connection to the Appellant. The fact that the  address
    on the document is also the  Appellant's  address  does  not  take  the
    matter beyond the Judge's observations at paragraph 12  in  respect  of
    obtaining personal information and documents at  a  house  of  multiple
    occupation with a common  letterbox.  In  any  event,  the  information
    displayed  on  the  document  -  which  shows  a  taxable  income  from
    employment  of  approximately  �32,500  -  is  inconsistent  with   the
    Appellant's claim made in his application form signed on  8  June  2016
    that he was no longer working. There was no suggestion before the First-
    tier Tribunal that the Appellant had resumed work: he would have had no
    permission to work; further, the Skeleton Argument dated 1 June 2018 at
    paragraph  15  confirms  that  the  Appellant  was  being   financially
    supported by friends albeit that he was "willing to work"  -  the  very
    clear inference being that he was not working. In any event, yet again,
    no explanation is apparent as to why  the  Appellant  would  have  been
    working as recently as 2016/2017 in a false identity using  a  National
    Insurance number that did not relate to him in circumstances  where  it
    was his case that he had had his own National Insurance  number  for  a
    very considerable period  of  time.  It  seems  to  me  that  far  from
    supporting the Appellant's case this  document  raises  more  questions
    than it answers, and acts  to  undermine  his  case.  Accordingly,  its
    apparent  disregard  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  could  not,  in  my
    judgement, have been materially to the prejudice of the Appellant.


34.  In light of my conclusion in respect of the first  line  of  challenge,
    in my judgement the other submissions  raised  in  the  Grounds  cannot
    avail the Appellant. Whilst the  Appellant  does  not  place  exclusive
    reliance upon the HMRC record set out in the letter of 24  April  2017,
    it is nonetheless vital to his case: he  cannot  succeed  only  on  the
    basis of the other materials.


35.  For completeness I note that in the course of  submissions  Mr  Jesurum
    argued that the Judge had unduly gone  beyond  the  parameters  of  the
    reasons in the RFRL by in substance determining that the Appellant  had
    acquired  a  false  identity.  This  submission  is   problematic   and
    ultimately without merit. Fundamentally, it is to  be  noted  that  the
    Appellant does not deny the use of an alias - which he mentions even in
    the course of his application  -  and  to  that  extent  he  is  hardly
    prejudiced by the Judge's exploration of the circumstances of  his  use
    of an alias. Whilst the RFRL is not overt in making  reference  to  the
    use of different identities, it is overt in  making  reference  to  the
    discrepancy  between  the  HMRC  document  and  the  Appellant's  other
    documents: to that extent exploration of the  Appellant's  own  case  -
    that he worked  under  different  identities  with  different  national
    insurance numbers - was an intrinsic part of  a  consideration  of  the
    issues in the appeal, requiring findings by the Judge. In any event, as
    Mr Jesurum eventually acknowledged, such a line of challenge formed  no
    part of the grounds in support of the  application  for  permission  to
    appeal or the grant of permission to appeal.


36.  In any event it is be noted that the Judge's ultimate finding was  that
    the Appellant whilst seeking to rely upon an employment history in  the
    identity of Geoffrey Ernest Smith had not been able to  establish  that
    he was himself responsible for the employment record  that  existed  in
    that name; in other words, that the Appellant had failed to  show  that
    he was the person who had undertaken the various employments  shown  in
    the HMRC record in that identity.


37.  Mr Jesurum sought to purse a further submission in respect of a  matter
    not seemingly argued before the First-tier  Tribunal  and  plainly  not
    raised in the grounds to the Upper Tribunal. My attention was  directed
    to an extract in the Respondent's 'GCID - Case Record Sheet',  obtained
    further  to  a  Subject  Access  Request  (see  pages  122-160  of  the
    Appellant's bundle before the First-tier Tribunal). The extracts  is  a
    minute from in or about March 2017 resulting in the action  of  writing
    to the Appellant for further information: as part of the  minute  there
    is a discussion as to gaps in the  Appellant's  evidence  submitted  to
    date; amongst other  things  the  following  is  written  -  "There  is
    insufficient documentary  evidence  for  2010-2012,  however  the  apps
    passports cover this period and there is no evidence of leaving or  re-
    entering the UK".


38.  The personal details pages  of  the  Appellant's  passports  have  been
    reproduced in the Respondent's bundle: the first shows issue on 24 July
    2009 in London, valid until 23 July 2014 (B2); the second  shows  issue
    on 31 March 2015 in London, valid until 30 March 2020 (B1).


39.  The Judge made  findings  at  paragraph  16  to  the  effect  that  the
    apparent lack of use of these passports did not reliably indicate  that
    the Appellant had not left the UK and re-entered, given  in  particular
    that he had acknowledged the use of aliases  whilst  in  the  UK.  This
    particular finding was not the subject of challenge in the  grounds  of
    appeal; nor was there any reference to the GCID  -  Case  Record  Sheet
    that Mr Jesurum now sought to raise. There was no application to  amend
    the grounds of challenge. In all the circumstances I declined to permit
    Mr Jesurum to develop a yet further point not duly pleaded.


40.  For the reasons given I find no material error of law in  the  decision
    of Judge  Graham.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  stands
    accordingly.

[1] It appears that the decision-maker was counting back 20 years  from  the
date of decision rather than,  for  example,  counting  20  years  from  the
claimed date of arrival in the UK,  or  20  years  back  from  the  date  of
application, or otherwise seeking to identify  any  unbroken  period  of  20
years. In the instant case the period of calculation will made  no  material
difference.
