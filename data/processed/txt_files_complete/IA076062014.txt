                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Kelly promulgated on 13th May 2014.

 2. The Appellant is a male citizen of India, born 4th  February  1988  who
    applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General)
    Student Migrant under the points-based system.

 3. The application was refused on 20th  January  2014  with  reference  to
    paragraph 245ZX(d) and paragraph 1A(c) of Appendix C of the Immigration
    Rules.

 4. The Respondent did not accept that the Appellant  was  entitled  to  be
    awarded the 10 points he had claimed in relation to  maintenance.   The
    Appellant was required to show that he was in possession of �1,600  for
    a consecutive 28 day period.  The closing date of the  entries  in  the
    Appellant's  bankbook  that  he  had  submitted  in  support   of   his
    application was 5th December 2013.  The Respondent  contended  that  he
    therefore needed to show evidence of �1,600 being available for 28 days
    from 8th November 2013 to 5th December 2013.

 5. The Respondent pointed out that the Appellant's bankbook showed that he
    had been in possession of no more than 60,914.89 rupees (�598)  between
    8th  November  and  18th November  2013  and  therefore  he  had  not
    demonstrated that he held the level of funds required for  the  28  day
    period.

 6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, requesting that  his
    appeal be determined on the papers.

 7. The appeal was considered by Judge Kelly (the judge) who found that the
    Respondent had  been  correct  to  refuse  the  application  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  The judge noted that  the  Appellant  had  provided
    bank statements with his Notice of Appeal, but was satisfied that these
    statements had not been submitted with the application,  and  therefore
    the judge was unable  to  take  them  into  account.   The  appeal  was
    dismissed.  The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the Upper
    Tribunal  contending  that  he  had  provided  evidence  that  he  held
    sufficient  funds  to  satisfy  the  maintenance  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge Macdonald  in  the
    following terms;

         "1.  The Appellant is a citizen of India whose appeal was dismissed
             by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kelly  in   a   determination
             promulgated on 13th May 2014.
         2.   The grounds of application contend that the  judge  failed  to
             note the additional page in the bankbook which disclosed  that
             he was in possession of sufficient funds to satisfy the rules,
             the judge having found that the  statement  was  not  included
             with the original application.
         3.   The question would appear to be whether the statement referred
             to by the Appellant was lodged with the application and absent
             legal representation the position is not as clear as it  might
             be.  However I infer that the Appellant is saying that he  did
             indeed lodge the book with the application which did show that
             he had sufficient funds - if that is so it is  arguable  that
             the judge erred in law in his decision.
         4.   Permission to appeal is granted on this basis.  It will be  up
             to the Appellant to satisfy the Upper  Tribunal  that  he  did
             lodge the bankbook with the application."

 9. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008, contending that the judge had directed himself appropriately  and
    the determination did not disclose an error of law.

10. Directions were subsequently issued making provision for there to be  a
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal  to  decide  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

11. The Appellant attended the hearing.  I satisfied myself that there  was
    no need for an  interpreter  and  proceedings  could  be  conducted  in
    English.

12. The Appellant indicated that he was content to  proceed  without  legal
    representation.  I explained to the Appellant the procedure that  would
    be adopted throughout the hearing.  I established that he had seen  the
    grant of permission to appeal, and the Respondent's rule 24 notice.

13. The Appellant asked me to find that the judge had erred,  in  that  the
    Appellant  did  have  the  necessary  funds  required  in  relation  to
    maintenance.  There was no copy of the Appellant's application form  on
    file, and Mr Melvin did not have a copy.  The Appellant confirmed  that
    he had submitted his application online, but in relation to maintenance
    he had submitted his State Bank of India savings passbook which was  on
    file.  The Appellant stated that he had submitted  his  application  on
    30th December 2013 and therefore took the view that the 28  day  period
    operated between 2nd December 2013 and 30th December 2013 and  he  had
    submitted bank statements with his appeal to cover that period.

14. Mr Melvin submitted that the judge had not erred and that  the  28  day
    period was between 8th November 2013, and 5th December 2013, which  was
    the last date of an entry in the Appellant's savings book.

My Conclusions and Reasons

15. The judge did not err in law.  The judge referred to Appendix A of  the
    Immigration Rules in paragraph 2 of the  determination  and  he  should
    have referred to Appendix C, but this is not a material error.

16. The Appellant has confirmed that the evidence of  maintenance  that  he
    submitted with his application was his  State  Bank  of  India  savings
    book.  The last entry in that book is 5th December  2013  as  correctly
    pointed out by the Respondent.  Therefore the Appellant  in  accordance
    with paragraph 1A(h) of Appendix C needed  to  show  that  he  had  the
    required funds for a 28 day period and the end date of this period  was
    the closing balance in the savings book that he had submitted with  his
    application.  The correct period  for  assessment  of  maintenance  was
    therefore 8th November to 5th December 2013 and the judge was correct
    so to find.  The  judge  correctly  found  that  in  that  period,  the
    Appellant did not have at least �1,600 in his account.  The  judge  was
    also correct to find that he could  not  take  into  account  documents
    submitted after the application as section 85A(4) of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 confirms that the Tribunal may consider
    evidence adduced by the Appellant, in a points-based application,  only
    if that evidence was submitted in support of and at the time of  making
    the application.  There are some  exceptions  to  this  provision,  but
    those exceptions did not apply in this case.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an  error  of
law.

I do not set aside the decision.  The appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

No order for anonymity was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no  request  for  anonymity  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  makes  no  anonymity
direction.
