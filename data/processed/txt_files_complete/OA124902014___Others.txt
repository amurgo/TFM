Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Haligan (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellants' appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Feeney promulgated on the 15th October 2015,  in  which
      he dismissed the Appellants' appeals against the Respondent's decision
      to refuse entry clearance as a partner and children under Appendix  FM
      of the Immigration Rules and also outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules
      under Article 8.

   2. The Appellants have sought  to  appeal  that  decision  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal.  Within  the  Grounds  of  Appeal  it  is  argued  that  the
      Immigration Judge erred in his assessment of Article  8  of  the  ECHR
      when considering whether to  grant  entry  clearance  outside  of  the
      Immigration Rules.  It was conceded within paragraph 5 of the  Grounds
      of Appeal that for the 2012/2013 tax year the  Sponsor  did  not  earn
      sufficient income to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules as
      a self-employed person.  It is argued that the application was put  on
      hold pending the resolution of MM v The Secretary  of  State  for  the
      Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 985 and that a decision was  not  made
      until the 26th August 2014, but that by the time the decision was made
      the Sponsor was earning  in  excess  of  the  minimum  requirement  of
      �24,800 and that the evidence from his tax return  for  the  2013/2014
      tax year showed an annual profit of �29,400 and that he  had  provided
      bank statements on or around the 5th January 2014 showing that he  was
      earning between �500 and �550  per  week.   It  is  argued  that  this
      evidence should have been taken into account by the Immigration  Judge
      and that under Section 85(5)(b) of the  Immigration,  Nationality  and
      Asylum Act 2002 in considering an appeal against the refusal of  entry
      clearance  the  Tribunal   may   consider   only   the   circumstances
      appertaining as at the date of the decision to refuse  and  that  this
      approach was endorsed by the Court of  Appeal  in  SS  (Congo)  v  The
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 387.

   3.  It is argued that when the decision was made by the  Respondent  that
      the Sponsor  did  meet  the  maintenance  requirements  and  that  the
      Respondent had been made aware  of  this  as  further  documents  were
      provided whilst the case had been on hold.  It is said  that  although
      all of the specified documents in accordance with Appendix FM-SE  were
      unable to be provided, the failure to do so should be regarded  as  "a
      near miss" in the context of SS  (Congo).   It  is  argued  the  Judge
      should have taken these factors into account and the case should  have
      been considered as a "near miss" which would  have  arguably  affected
      his assessment of proportionality and the competing  public  interests
      and that the Judge's failure to recognises this as a "near miss"  case
      was highly significant and that when coupled with the other factors in
      the Appellants' favour including the  fact  that  the  Sponsor  earned
      sufficient income, the Sponsor's British  citizenship  and  length  of
      residence  in  the  UK  and  the  British  citizenship  of  2  of  the
      Appellant's other children, it  could  arguably  have  resulted  in  a
      different outcome.  It was further argued that  the  application  took
      almost 1 year to be decided by the Respondent and  that  there  was  a
      further year to get an appeal hearing  and  that  such  a  significant
      delay cannot support the proposition of maintaining a proper system of
      immigration control and that in such circumstances the refusal of  the
      application cannot be said to be in pursuit of the economic  wellbeing
      of the country, as  at  the  time  of  the  decision  the  maintenance
      requirements were met.

   4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Simpson
      on the 11th April 2016, who found  that  overseas  appeals  should  be
      assessed at the date of the decision and that in this case the date of
      the decision was the 26th August 2014 and that whilst it was  accepted
      that the Sponsor was not able to satisfy Appendix FM-SE as at the date
      of the application, it was arguable that he did meet the  requirements
      as at the date of the decision and that consequently it  was  arguable
      that this was a "near miss" case in the context of SS (Congo) and that
      in such circumstances  the  determination  did  disclose  an  arguable
      material error of law.

   5. Within the Respondent's Rule 24 Reply it is argued that the First-tier
      Tribunal Judge directed himself  appropriately.   It  is  argued  that
      whilst it is acknowledged that the date of  decision  is  the  correct
      date at which the Tribunal has to determine the applications of out of
      country appeals, but what the Grounds of Appeal failed to  acknowledge
      is that this must be viewed with the wording of the Immigration  Rules
      in mind and that the consideration as at the date of the decision  was
      whether or not the Appellant had provided the  specified  evidence  of
      financial income for the last  full  financial  year  (Appendix  FM-SE
      paragraph 7; 12A(e); 19(d)).  It was argued  that  the  Appellant  Mrs
      Mohammed conceded that she was  not  in  a  position  to  satisfy  the
      requirements as stipulated by the Rules.  It was further  argued  that
      even if the Judge had considered that the Appellants met the Rules  at
      a later stage outside of the relevant period and/or did not  have  the
      specified evidence it would only be pertinent if and only if it  could
      be shown that there were compelling circumstances to justify  a  grant
      outside of the Rules, as set out within the case of  SS  (Congo).   It
      was argued that as there were  no  compelling  circumstances  in  this
      case, the claim could not succeed outside the rules in any event.

   6. It was on that basis that  the  case  came  before  me  in  the  Upper
      Tribunal.

   7. In his oral  submissions  on  behalf  of  the  Appellants  Mr  Haligan
      initially sought  to  argue  that  there  were  errors  in  the  entry
      clearance manager's review relating to [MM].  However, I  pointed  out
      to Mr Haligan that the Upper Tribunal was not at this stage  rehearing
      the appeal, but was seeking to determine whether  or  not  there  were
      material errors in the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Feeney,
      and that although Mr Haligan sought to argue  that  Judge  Feeney  had
      indicated that he had taken the entry clearance manager's  views  into
      account, this did not mean that the Appellants could seek to challenge
      statements made  within  the  entry  clearance  manager's  review,  as
      opposed to the reasoning given by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Feeney.
      The question before me was whether  or  not  Judge  Feeney's  decision
      contained material errors, and was not a  rehearing  of  the  original
      appeal, at a stage when the Tribunal was considering  whether  or  not
      there were material errors of law.  I therefore  did  not  allow  that
      argument to be run.

   8. Mr Haligan then sought to argue that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had
      made findings which were not open to him, in respect of  his  findings
      regarding the best interests of the children at [25] of the  decision.
      However, although Mr Haligan sought to argue that this was relevant to
      whether or not this was a "near miss" case, in reality  this  argument
      that the Judge made findings which were not open to him  in  terms  of
      the best interests of the children,  was  in  fact  a  new  ground  of
      appeal, that was not argued within the original Grounds of Appeal, nor
      in respect of which had permission to appeal been  granted  by  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Simpson.  No application was made by Mr Haligan to
      amend the Grounds of Appeal to argue that the Judge had made  findings
      which were not open to him, and in  such  circumstances,  I  have  not
      taken such arguments into account in reaching my decision.

   9. However, even if I am wrong in that regard, I would still  have  found
      that the argument that the Judge made a finding at paragraph  25  that
      was not open to him, lacked merit.  The Judge had clearly  taken  into
      account all of the relevant factors in terms of the best interests  of
      the children at [25] and taken account of  the  fact  that  2  of  the
      Sponsor's children were British citizens, although not the 2  children
      who were Appellants, and although the 2  eldest  children  as  British
      citizens would have the right  to  come  to  the  UK,  that  does  not
      necessarily mean that it was in their best interests to  do  so.   The
      two issues are separate.  The Judge had come to reasons in respect  of
      the best interests of all of the  children  including  the  2  younger
      children who were Appellants, which were open to him on the  evidence.



  10. Further, although Mr Haligan then sought to  argue  that  the  Judge's
      finding at [23] that Mr Mohammed Nasser, Mrs  Mohammed's  husband  and
      [MM] and [MS]'s father, would be able  to  return  to  Afghanistan  to
      establish family life there if he so chose, was again a decision  that
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge was not entitled to make, for  the  same
      reasons, I find that this  was  not  an  argument  raised  within  the
      Grounds of Appeal, nor  has  permission  to  appeal  been  granted  in
      respect of it and that in such circumstances it is  inappropriate  for
      such argument to run when no application was made to amend the Grounds
      of Appeal and no application was made for permission to appeal to  the
      First-tier Tribunal in respect of such an argument.

  11. In any event, even if I am wrong in that finding, I would  have  still
      considered that the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Feeney  in
      that regard was open to him and that even though it was argued  by  Mr
      Haligan that Mr Mohammed had said that he in his  statement  had  been
      granted asylum in the UK and had set up life in the UK including a job
      and a home here, and that he did not want to go back  to  Afghanistan,
      the Judge's reasons as to why it was open to him if he so chose to  go
      back to Afghanistan at [23] were findings which were open  to  him  on
      the evidence.  The Judge fully took account of the fact that  although
      having claimed asylum in the UK, Mr Mohammed Nasser  had  returned  to
      Afghanistan in 2009 and 2012 and that there was no  evidence  that  he
      had been stopped or experienced difficulties on entry or when  leaving
      or whilst in Afghanistan or that he was in fact at  risk  upon  return
      and would be at risk upon return.  However, for the  reasons  set  out
      above, I do not regard that such arguments are relevant  or  pertinent
      to the basis upon which permission to appeal was granted, in terms  of
      whether or not this was "a near miss" case, and the arguments from  Mr
      Haligan that this was relevant to whether it was  a  near  miss  case,
      simply mask the fact that this was sought to be in reality a  separate
      ground of appeal, in respect of which permission to appeal should have
      been sought and was not.

  12. Mr Haligan next argued that had the reviewing officer  conducting  the
      review properly analysed the case in  January  2015,  he  should  have
      allowed the case as a near miss, and that further First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Feeney should have allowed the case as a near miss.   He  argued
      that the case had been put on hold originally pending  the  resolution
      of the appeal to the Court of Appeal in the case of MM v The Secretary
      of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA  Civ  985  and  that  the
      decision was not made until the 26th August 2014, and that  thereafter
      the case was not reviewed until January 2015.  He said that there  was
      therefore a delay between the date of the application in October  2013
      and the date of the decision and the review which was not the fault of
      the Appellants.  He argued that the Sponsor  Mr  Mohammed  Nasser  did
      meet the financial requirements as at the date of  the  decision,  and
      that this did amount to a compelling reason why the case  should  have
      been allowed outside of the Immigration Rules  under  Article  8.   He
      argued that the Appellants had been put to a great deal of expense  in
      making the application and that they  were  not  responsible  for  the
      delays.  He argued that the mischief behind the rules was  to  prevent
      spouses bringing partners who would then be reliant upon public funds,
      but this was not the case here.  He did concede that between 2013  and
      2014 there had been a drop in Mr Nasser's income to �8,900 because  of
      injury.

  13. Mr Tufan in this regard argued that the application had been  made  in
      October 2013 and it was at most 10 months later  before  the  decision
      was reached, even bearing in mind  the  case  had  been  put  on  hold
      awaiting the decision of the Court of Appeal in MM v The Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department.

  14. Mr Tufan argued that the application was refused on the basis  of  the
      requirements of Appendix FM and Appendix  FM-SE  not  being  met.   He
      argued that the documentary requirements included documentary evidence
      regarding tax payable, annual assessments of tax returns, and personal
      bank statements for a 12 month period.  He argued that not all of  the
      requisite financial documentary evidence had been  provided  and  that
      these were mandatory requirements.  He  argued  that  paragraph  D  of
      Appendix FM-SE makes it clear that these documents had to be submitted
      with the application.  He argued that if the  Rules  required  certain
      documentary evidence, then this could not be got around  by  means  of
      Section 85 and that a new application  should  be  made.   He  further
      argued that it would have to be compelling circumstances before a case
      could be allowed outside of the Immigration Rules following  the  case
      of SS (Congo).

  15. Having considered carefully  all  of  the  arguments  raised  both  in
      writing and orally on behalf of the Appellants and the  Respondent,  I
      am not satisfied that it has been established  that  the  decision  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Feeney does contact a material error of law,
      for the reasons set out below. I have considered all of  the  evidence
      and all of the submissions before making my findings.

  16. Although when considering the Appellants' application  under  Appendix
      FM and Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules,  pursuant  to  Section
      85(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  the  Judge
      when considering the appeal against refusal  of  entry  clearance  was
      considering the circumstances appertaining  as  at  the  date  of  the
      decision to refuse on the 26th August 2014, the Judge was  considering
      whether or not the requirements of the Immigration Rules were  met  as
      at that date.  In respect of the  specified  evidence  required  under
      Appendix FM-SE relating to entry clearance for  the  Appellants  as  a
      spouse and children, Appendix FM-SE paragraph D  clearly  states  that
      "In deciding an application in relation to which this appendix  states
      that specified documents must be provided, the entry clearance officer
      or Secretary of State ('the decision maker') will  consider  documents
      that have been submitted with the application and will  only  consider
      documents submitted after the application where sub-paragraphs (b)  or
      (e)  applies".   It  is  clear  that  sub-paragraph  (b)  relates   to
      situations where the Appellant has submitted a sequence  of  documents
      and some of the  documents  in  the  sequence  have  been  omitted;  a
      document being in the wrong format; a document that is a copy and  not
      an original; or a document which does not contain  all  the  specified
      information in  circumstances  where  an  Appellant  had  submitted  a
      specified document the decision maker may contact the Appellant or his
      representative in writing  and  request  the  document  or  a  correct
      version.  Sub-paragraph (e) related to a situation where the  decision
      maker was satisfied that there was a  valid  reason  why  a  specified
      document(s) cannot be supplied.  The Rules therefore  did  not  permit
      consideration  under  the  Immigration  Rules  of  further   documents
      submitted  subsequently,  in  order  to  show  compliance   with   the
      Immigration Rules.  The Rules did not simply permit further subsequent
      documentation to be submitted, to show  that  in  fact  the  financial
      requirements were met at a date between the date  of  application  and
      the date of the decision.

  17. Further, under paragraph 7 of the Appendix FM-SE, in respect of  self-
      employment in the UK, there had to be evidence of the  amount  of  tax
      payable, paid and unpaid for the last full financial year, the  annual
      self-assessment tax return, a statement  of  account,  and  also  bank
      statements for the same 12 month period as  the  tax  returns  showing
      that the income from self-employment had been paid into an account  in
      the name of the person or the name of the  person  and  their  partner
      jointly.  In such circumstances First-tier Tribunal Judge  Feeney  was
      quite correct at [6] to find that the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE
      were not met, as had been conceded by Mr Richardson on behalf  of  the
      Appellants and that the Sponsor had accepted  that  he  did  not  earn
      sufficient money in the 2012/2013 year, as he was  only  working  part
      time as he had a medical problem with his knee.  The Judge went on  to
      recognise that by the time he did make the application he was  working
      full time and was earning enough money to satisfy the  Rules  but  the
      difficulty arose because under the Rules the  evidential  requirements
      in Appendix FM-SE make specific provision in relation to  evidence  of
      self-employed income which required evidence of income  for  the  full
      financial year preceding the date of  the  application  and  that  the
      Appellants' Sponsor was not able to show sufficient income during that
      time.

  18.  Although it was argued before me that in fact the Sponsor was earning
      the requisite level of income by the date of the decision, it  remains
      clear that the Sponsor did not meet the requirements of  Appendix  FM-
      SE, in terms of provision of the specified documentary evidence,  such
      that the sponsor was unable to show sufficient income during the  year
      preceding the date of the application.

  19. Although  there  was  a  10  month  delay  between  the  date  of  the
      applications and the date of the original decision by the  Respondent,
      given the fact that the Court of Appeal's decision in MM was  awaited,
      that period of delay was not sufficient, being only 10 months, to lead
      to unfairness in the circumstances of this case, and the fact that the
      Sponsor's financial circumstances had seemingly improved  during  that
      period, did not mean that the Judge at first instance was  wrong  when
      considering the case under the Rules to find that the requirements  of
      the Immigration Rules were not met.

  20. In respect of the argument that when considering the case  outside  of
      the Rules, that delay was relevant and that the case should have  been
      considered as a "near miss", I remind myself that the Supreme Court in
      the case of Patel and Others v The Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2013] UKSC 72, made it clear that Article 8 outside of the
      Immigration Rules is not to be used as a "general  dispensing  power".
      It is further clear  that  in  fact,  when  considering  the  evidence
      submitted with the application that had to be taken into account  when
      considering the appeal under the Immigration Rules, that this was  not
      a "near miss" case and that the Sponsor simply had  not  provided  the
      requisite documentary evidence to establish that he met the  financial
      requirement of earning in excess of �24,800.

  21. As was conceded by Mr Haligan on behalf  of  the  Appellants,  between
      2013 and 2014, indeed the Sponsor's income had dropped to just  �8,900
      because of injury.  On the evidence submitted  with  the  application,
      that the Sponsor was not earning anywhere near the requisite level  of
      earnings.

  22. Although it was submitted that his earnings had subsequently increased
      before the date  of  the  decision,  the  full  requisite  documentary
      evidence as required under Appendix FM-SE had not been  submitted,  in
      order to show that increased level of income, and could not have  been
      taken into account anyway, given that it  post-dated  the  application
      under Appendix FM paragraph  D.   The  specific  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules  in  terms  of  the  requisite  evidence  cannot  be
      circumvented simply by reliance upon Section 85(5), and whether or not
      the Appellants did meet the requirements of the Rules and  whether  or
      not this was a near miss, had to be determined in accordance with  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Given  that  on  the  evidence
      presented with the application that was to be taken into account,  the
      Sponsor came nowhere near meeting the requirements of the  Immigration
      Rules, this cannot be deemed to be a "near miss" on the basis that  it
      was said that his income had increased in the interim before the  date
      of the decision.  The Immigration Rules set out  specific  documentary
      evidence has to be provided in order to establish income, and that had
      not happened in respect of the claimed increase in income.  This  case
      was therefore not a "near miss" case.

  23. In such circumstances  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Feeney  was  quite
      correct in deciding that this was not  a  "near  miss"  case  for  the
      reasons set out within [27] of his decision.

  24. However, even if I am wrong in that  regard,  as  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Feeney properly set out at [28] of his  decision,  it  was  made
      clear by the Court of Appeal in the case of Secretary of State for the
      Home Department v SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387,  that  at
      [56] that  "If  an  applicant  can  show  that  there  are  individual
      interests at stake covered by Article 8 which give rise  to  a  strong
      claim that compelling circumstances may exist to justify the grant  of
      LTE outside of the Rules, the fact that their case is  also  a   'near
      miss' may be a relevant consideration which  tips  the  balance  under
      Article 8 in their favour".  However, in my judgement Judge Feeney was
      properly correct in finding that there were no individual interests at
      stake which gave rise to a strong claim that compelling  circumstances
      existed to justify the grant  of  leave  outside  of  the  Immigration
      Rules, in any event.  The fact that it is claimed by the Appellants to
      be a "near miss" does not in itself mean that that  is  a  "compelling
      circumstance" as only if there are  compelling  circumstances  is  the
      fact  that  the  case  is  said  to  be  a  "near  miss"  a   relevant
      consideration which may tip the  balance  under  Article  8  in  their
      favour.

  25. In such circumstances,  in  my  judgement  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Feeney did properly consider all of the circumstances  in  respect  of
      the Appellant's claim both under the Immigration Rules and in  respect
      of Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules, and that  his  approach
      in respect of this not being a "near miss" case was perfectly  correct
      and it was open to him in the circumstances to find that there were no
      compelling circumstances in any event which  justified  the  grant  of
      leave to enter outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge's findings in respect of Article 8 were perfectly  open
      to him and were adequately and sufficiently reasoned.  The decision of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Feeney does not disclose any material  error
      of law and is maintained.  The Appellants' appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Feeney  does  not  disclose  any

dismissed.
