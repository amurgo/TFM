Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Erwin Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Dipnarain, Duncan Lewis & Co (Solicitors)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. In this matter I will refer to the parties by the style in which  they
      appeared before the First-Tier Tribunal.

   2. The appellant is a female citizen of  Cuba  born  6  July  1994.   She
      appealed against the decision by the respondent  dated  26  June  2013
      refusing to grant her leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
      partner.  Reference was made to Appendix FM and Section 276ADE of  the
      Immigration Rules.  The appellant also appealed under ECHR.

   3. The appellant's appeal came before Judge of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
      Trevaskis sitting at Newport on  3  April  2014.   Both  parties  were
      represented (the appellant by Ms Dipnarain).

   4. In a decision promulgated on 10 April 2014,  Judge  Trevaskis  allowed
      the appeal "under the Immigration Rules".

   5. The respondent sought leave  to  appeal  that  decision  alleging  one
      ground of failure to give adequate reasons for  findings  on  material
      matters.  This is amplified by four  specific  paragraphs.   Error  is
      alleged in the judge finding that the sponsor demonstrated his overall
      income exceeding the level set out in Appendix FM, but failed to  give
      adequate reasons for that finding.   Reference  is  also  made  to  an
      allegation that the judge failed to properly  take  into  account  the
      date of an English Language Certificate.

   6. The application was considered by  another  judge  of  the  First-Tier
      Tribunal and permission  to  appeal  was  granted  for  the  following
      reasons:

         "1.  The respondent seeks permission to appeal, in time, against  a
      decision of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Trevaskis who in a determination
      promulgated on 10 April 2014 allowed the  appellant's  appeal  against
      the respondent's decision to refuse to grant  lease  to  remain  as  a
      partner.

     2.  The application has been  made  timeously  -  taking  into  account
      Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.

     3.  The basis of  the  application  was  that  the  appellant  had  not
      provided specified evidence from sources listed  paragraph  E-LTRP.3.2
      of specified gross annual income of at least �18,600.  It  was  stated
      that the judge of the First-Tier Tribunal had failed to demonstrate on
      what basis the  appellant  met  the  maintenance  requirements  -  and
      whether specified evidence from the sources  listed  in  paragraph  E-
      LTRP.3.2 had been provided.  It was pointed out that  such  evidential
      requirements  were  mandatory.   A  further  grounds  was   that   the
      appellant's English language test had been carried out  in  June  2013
      with the application having been submitted on 27 April 2013.

     4.  The Immigration Judge in a brief  determination  does  not  provide
      reasons for reaching any of the conclusions in regard  to  the  income
      requirement and the English language requirement.  An  arguable  error
      of law is accordingly established.

     5.  Permission to appeal is allowed".

   7. Thus the matter came before me sitting in the Upper Tribunal.

   8. Ms Dipnarain confirmed that the appellant was not present.

   9. Mr Richards relied upon  the  grounds  seeking  leave.   There  was  a
      failure by the judge to identify evidence  and  the  English  language
      requirements had not  been  satisfied  or  met  at  the  time  of  the
      application or at the time of the respondent's decision.

  10. Ms Dipnarian indicated that the judge had before him a complete bundle
      including a table of calculations showing the amount available to  the
      sponsor.  The judge had taken this into account in  finding  that  the
      income met the threshold.  There was sufficient  evidence  before  him
      and the judge had come to  the  correct  conclusion.   The  judge  had
      properly accepted the language test certificate that was available  at
      the hearing and there was no material error of law.

  11. Following submissions I  announced  that  I  considered  there  was  a
      material error of law and that the decision of the First-Tier Tribunal
      Judge could not stand and must be set aside.  No findings of fact  had
      been made so none could be preserved.  The appellant was  not  present
      and in all the circumstances I considered it appropriate  (bearing  in
      mind the Senior President's direction) to remit the appeal back to the
      First-Tier Tribunal to a judge other than Judge Trevaskis.

  12. My reasons for reaching this conclusion are as follows.

  13. The  judge  granting  leave  refers  to  the  determination  of  Judge
      Trevaskis as being "a brief determination".  In the circumstances that
      is rather an understatement.  The determination runs to  approximately
      2� pages.   Approximately  1�  pages  set  out  the  application,  the
      respondent's case and an adjudication regarding an application for  an
      adjournment.  The representatives submissions  are  then  set  out  in
      three short paragraphs each  before  three  equally  short  paragraphs
      under the heading "My Findings".

  14. Paragraphs 20 and 21 refer to the main issues before the judge.  It is
      appropriate that I set them out as follows.

         "20. The present application for leave to remain  was  made  on  27
      April 2014.  It falls to be considered under  the  new  Rules.   I  am
      satisfied that  the  appellant  has  satisfied  the  English  language
      requirement because she has passed  with  distinction  the  ESOL  test
      which she sat in June 2013.

     21. I find that the sponsor has  demonstrated  total  income  from  his
      four  sources  of  income  amounting  to  �19,732.13,  and   therefore
      exceeding the required amount under the Rules".

  15. As can be seen  from  above,  paragraph  20  deals  with  the  English
      language requirements.  The date and relevance of the certificate were
      at issue, but these have not been dealt with in paragraph 20.

  16. Paragraph 21  deals  with  the  sponsor's  income,  but  there  is  no
      explanation whatsoever as to how the judge reached his conclusions  as
      to why he accepted that figure and what the evidence was.

  17. It is often said that a determination should be written to the  losing
      party as an explanation as to why the decision was made.  There is  no
      explanation whatsoever on the keys issues that were before the  judge.
      This amounts to an error of law which must be material to the outcome.
       The decision of Judge Trevaskis can therefore not stand and  must  be
      set aside, and be remade by the First-Tier Tribunal  for  the  reasons
      set out above.





Signed                                  Date 22/8/14
