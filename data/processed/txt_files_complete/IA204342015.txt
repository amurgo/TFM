                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. The Respondent refused the Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
         remain on 15 May 2015.  His  appeal  was  dismissed  by  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Davies ("the  Judge")  following  a  hearing  on  19
         October 2015.



The grant of permission

      2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchinson  granted  permission  to
         appeal (15 April 2016) stating that:

             "It is arguable that the Judge erred in law by  dismissing  as
             not relevant paragraph 15 of Appendix FM-SE when the Judge has
             not shown what calculations were performed or what income  was
             accepted by the Judge as  at  the  date  of  application  when
             taking into account all sources of the Spouse's employment  in
             the 12 months prior to the date  of  application  which  would
             bring the income level above the �18,600 threshold."

Respondent's position

      3. Mrs Peterson relied on the Rule 24 notice  (20  April  2016)  which
         stated that the Judge applied  the  relevant  requirements  of  the
         rules and gave sufficient reasons. The Judge is not obliged  to  do
         calculations. After she considered the rules she conceded that  the
         whole of the Sponsor's income from Tax Focus (Yorkshire) Ltd should
         have been taken into account which, when included, would have taken
         the Sponsor above the relevant threshold.

Discussion

      4. The Sponsor had 3 sources of income. The 1st source of  income  was
         from McDonald's where the relevant annual income was �7,723.11. The
         2nd source of income was from Hermes Care Ltd  where  the  relevant
         annual income was �9,803.64. In relation to both of these jobs  the
         Sponsor had worked for more than 6 months and both  of  these  sums
         were properly included within the relevant threshold calculation.

      5. The 3rd source of income was from Tax Focus (Yorkshire)  Ltd  where
         she had worked for less than 6 months. It is clear from Appendix FM-
         SE 13 (b) of the immigration rules that the actual amount earned in
         the relevant period (which in this case was less than 6 months) was
         not to be scaled up but was simply to  be  added  to  the  other  2
         sources of income.

      6. The Respondent had entirely excluded that  income  in  the  refusal
         letter and the Judge agreed. The Respondent and Judge were  plainly
         wrong.

      7. That amounted to a material error  of  law.  I  therefore  set  the
         decision aside.

      8. Both representatives agreed that I need not remit the matter to the
         First-Tier Tribunal as I had all the evidence to enable me to  make
         a decision.

Rehearing

      9. The relevant income from this 3rd  job  as  was  evident  from  the
         combination of the payslips dated 10 March 2015 and 10  April  2015
         was �3,252.58. This amount should have been added to  the  other  2
         jobs to provide a total income of �20,779.33. This plainly  exceeds
         the threshold of �18,600.

     10. The Appeal is allowed as the relevant documents clearly  show  that
         at all times  the  financial  thresholds  were  met  and,  had  the
         Respondent followed her own policy, that would have become clear.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

    I allow the Appellant's substantive appeal.
