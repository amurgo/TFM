                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1.     The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
         granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan on 2 March 2015 against
         the decision and reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge Finch who had
         allowed the Respondent's appeal against  the  Appellant's  decision
         dated 18 March 2014 to refuse to  grant  the  Respondent  leave  to
         remain under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules and/or under
         Article 8 ECHR and to remove  him  from  the  United  Kingdom.  The
         decision and reasons was promulgated on 19 January 2015.

    2.     The Respondent is a national of Sri  Lanka,  born  there  on  23
         December 1998.  He had entered the United Kingdom as a student, his
         father's dependant, on 6 August 2006.  His immigration  history  is
         set out in full at [1] of Judge Finch's decision and reasons.   The
         present appeal was against the Removal Directions  dated  18  March
         2014 issued under section 10 of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
         1999, following refusal of the Respondent's application made  on  5
         November 2013 for leave to remain in his own  right  on  the  basis
         that the Respondent had lived in the United Kingdom for  more  than
         seven years.

    3.     Judge Finch allowed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  and
         made no mention of the claim made under Article 8 ECHR: see [12] of
         her decision.  Exactly what her decision was, it has to be said, is
         unclear.  It seems her intention was to  allow  that  appeal  under
         paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv), resulting in limited leave  to  remain  to
         the Respondent.

    4.     Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  as  sought  by  the
         Appellant was granted by Judge Chohan because she  considered  that
         it was arguable that the judge had failed to  consider  whether  it
         would be reasonable to expect the Respondent to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom, which was part of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv).  The judge  had
         given no reasons as to why it would not be reasonable to expect the
         Respondent to leave the United Kingdom.  The issue had  simply  not
         been addressed.

    5.     Standard directions were made by the Upper Tribunal.

    Submissions - error of law

    6.     Mr Avery for the Secretary of State submitted that  this  was  a
         clear case of legal error, as the grant of permission to appeal  by
         the First-tier Tribunal indicated. There  was  no  mention  of  the
         reasonableness test.  The judge had evidently misconstrued the rule
         and so had missed an essential point.   No  relevant  findings  had
         been made.

    7.     Mr Sreekumar for the Respondent said that  he  could  not  argue
         with that submission.  [12] of the decision and reasons was hard to
         understand.  He was content for the decision and reasons to be  set
         aside and the appeal reheard.  He was content to  proceed  on  that
         basis, and to do so immediately.

    The error of law finding

    8.     At the conclusion of submissions, the tribunal indicated that it
         found that the judge had fallen into material error of law, for the
         reasons succinctly indicated in the grant of permission  to  appeal
         by the First-tier Tribunal.  The decision and reasons would be  set
         aside and the appeal reheard immediately.

    The rehearing

    9.     For clarity the tribunal will now refer to the parties by  their
         designations  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  Appellant  gave
         evidence in accordance with  his  witness  statements,  which  were
         accompanied by copies of his  educational  certificates  and  other
         attainments.  In summary the Appellant said that he had come to the
         United Kingdom with his parents from Sri Lanka when he was 7  years
         7 months old.  He had studied only 3ï¿½ years in Sri Lanka.  All  his
         connections were in the United Kingdom,  apart  from  his  maternal
         grandparents who lived in Sri Lanka.  He spoke  only  English.   He
         had returned to Sri Lanka 3 times, with visits of between 2  and  4
         weeks.  His parents owned no property in Sri Lanka.  His  education
         would suffer if he had to return to Sri Lanka, as would his  career
         prospects.  He would suffer  harm  if  he  were  returned,  as  the
         schools had a different system.  The culture was alien to him.

    10.    In his oral evidence the Appellant said that  he  had  completed
         his GCSE examinations and was intending to do "A" levels and attend
         university.  He wanted to study computing.  His uncles lived in the
         United Kingdom

    11.    Under cross-examination the Appellant insisted that his  parents
         used English at home.  His father had come to the United Kingdom to
         study.  They rented a flat.

    12.    Mr Avery for the  Secretary  of  State  submitted  that  it  was
         reasonable to expect the Appellant to return to Sri Lanka with  his
         parents: see AM (S  117B)  Malawi  [2015]  UKUT  0260  (IAC).   The
         Appellant had no status in the United Kingdom, nor did his parents.
          There were judicial review proceedings but these were based on the
         son's position.  The Appellant's parents came to the United Kingdom
         to study and had no expectation of permanent status.  Any  hardship
         to the Appellant was the result of  the  choices  his  parents  had
         made.  There was no evidence from the parents  about  language  but
         English was widely spoken  in  Sri  Lanka  in  any  event.   As  it
         happened, the Appellant was at a natural break in his education and
         it was a sensible time to leave.  He would have the support of  his
         parents.  The appeal should be dismissed.

    13.    Mr Sreekumar for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant  had
         lived longer in the United Kingdom than in Sri Lanka.  At 16 he was
         at a  crucial  age.   His  wishes  as  a  young  person  should  be
         respected.  It would be difficult for him to return  to  Sri  Lanka
         and unfair to expect it.  His case should be  viewed  independently
         from his parents.  The appeal should be allowed.

    Discussion and fresh decision

    14.    There was no significant dispute of fact  in  this  appeal.  The
         Appellant came to the United Kingdom  with  his  parents,  for  the
         purpose of his  father's  studies.   That  purpose  has  long  been
         fulfilled and his parents' attempts to remain in the United Kingdom
         to settle have failed.  Neither they  nor  the  Appellant  has  any
         right to be in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  fact  that  there  are
         judicial review proceedings in progress is simply indicative of the
         parents' refusal to accept that their hopes of settlement have  not
         been achieved.  The Appellant's status has always  been  precarious
         in that neither he nor his parents has ever been  lawfully  in  the
         United Kingdom on a settlement route.

    15.    The Appellant retains important links with Sri Lanka, where  his
         education commenced.  If the Appellant is to be believed as to  his
         complete lack of knowledge of any of the main Sri Lankan  languages
         (Singhalese and Tamil), then his early  education  must  have  been
         conducted in English, indicating the  availability  of  tuition  in
         English in Sri Lanka.  In any event,  it  cannot  be  doubted  that
         English is widely spoken by educated people in  Sri  Lanka  and  of
         course is used on official documents.  The Appellant  has  kept  in
         touch with Sri Lanka by means of his three  family  visits  to  his
         maternal grandparents, and also through  his  paternal  uncles  who
         live  in  the  United  Kingdom.    The  tribunal  infers  that  the
         Appellant will have been in contact with his  grandparents  between
         such visits, as he had current knowledge of their health.

    16.    The Appellant, like his  parents,  is  a  member  of  the  Roman
         Catholic Church.  He will be free to continue to practice his faith
         in Sri Lanka where the Roman  Catholic  Church  has  a  significant
         presence.  The church is well known for providing assistance to its
         flock and so will be a further source of support as well as  social
         contact.

    17.    It is of course understandable that a person of the  Appellant's
         age places great value on his  circle  of  local  friends,  but  he
         remains his parents' dependant and no doubt it is intended that  he
         should remain so until at least the completion  of  his  education.
         At the present time the Appellant's parents have no right  to  work
         and the family situation is therefore seriously disadvantaged.  The
         parents sold their property in Sri Lanka but own no  house  in  the
         United Kingdom and are tenants.  No reason was given as to why  the
         Appellant's parents cannot rent a house or flat in  Sri  Lanka,  or
         stay with the Appellant's grandparents on an interim basis.

    18.    There was no independent evidence of any kind  to  suggest  that
         the Appellant would suffer any personal harm  if  returned  to  Sri
         Lanka.  He has received a free education in the United  Kingdom  at
         the expense of the taxpayer, despite his  precarious  status.   The
         United Kingdom  has  no  obligation  to  continue  the  Appellant's
         education, although he is free to seek entry clearance to return to
         the United Kingdom as a fee paying student if he wishes.

    19.    Guidance on the question of reasonableness was provided  by  the
         Upper Tribunal in AM (above).  As the headnote states at (6):  When
         the question posed by  s117B(6)  is  the  same  question  posed  in
         relation to children by paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) it  must  be  posed
         and answered in the proper context of whether it was reasonable  to
         expect the child to follow its parents to their country of  origin;
         EV (Philippines). It is not however a question  that  needs  to  be
         posed and answered in relation to each child more than once.

    20.    The tribunal is unable to find that it is unreasonable to expect
         the Appellant to return to Sri Lanka.  The Appellant was always  in
         the United Kingdom on a temporary and thus  precarious  basis.   It
         may be that he disapproves of his parents' choices, but  there  was
         no suggestion that his parents are  other  than  loving,  competent
         parents whose hopes have not been achieved.  As  Mr  Avery  pointed
         out, the Appellant has reached a natural break  in  his  education,
         having completed his  GCSEs.    It  is  not  the  United  Kingdom's
         responsibility to  provide  for  the  Appellant's  education.   Any
         difference in quality between Sri  Lanka  and  the  United  Kingdom
         respective systems is a matter for the government and  citizens  of
         Sri Lanka.  The Appellant has his parents  available  for  guidance
         and support.

    21.     Thus  while  the  Appellant   satisfies   part   of   paragraph
         276ADE(1)(iv), i.e., being under 18 and having spent  more  than  7
         years in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  tribunal  finds  that  it  is
         reasonable for him to return to Sri Lanka with his parents.

    22.    Article 8 ECHR was not the subject of  specific  submissions  at
         the rehearing  but  was  considered  by  the  Secretary  of  State.
         Obviously there will be no interference with the Appellant's family
         life as he and his parents will be returned to Sri Lanka together.

    23.    Nasim and Others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC) applies  to
         the Appellant's private life in the United Kingdom.  The  Appellant
         will be able to remain in  contact  with  his  current  friends  by
         modern means of communication, although the reality of his stage of
         life is that he will find paths of friendships  diverge  as  people
         choose more specialised educational  opportunities.  There  was  no
         factor in the Appellant's private life which the tribunal considers
         was such as to require the  Secretary  of  State  to  consider  the
         exercise of her discretion outside the Immigration  Rules,  as  the
         Appellant can continue his education and practise his  religion  in
         Sri Lanka.

    24.    The fact that the Appellant meets some of the factors listed  in
         section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
         does not create a right for him to  stay  in  the  United  Kingdom.
         They are merely factors which must be taken into consideration, and
         the tribunal has done so.

    25.    If that were a mistaken or incomplete view for any  reason,  the
         live  issue  applying  the  Razgar  [2004]   UKHL   27   tests   is
         proportionality.  The legitimate objective is immigration  control,
         which embraces  many  related  matters.   An  important  aspect  of
         immigration control for the purposes of the present appeal is  that
         the decision as to which non citizens are permitted  to  settle  in
         the United Kingdom is not a matter of private  choice,  whether  or
         not there will be any measurable cost or indeed potential  economic
         benefit  from  such  settlement.    There  has  to   be   a   rule,
         democratically determined, which  applies  to  all.   Those  rules,
         already strict, were made far stricter by parliament  from  9  July
         2012 onwards, a process which continues.

    26.    In the tribunal's view, the proportionality balance  is  against
         the Appellant.  He is simply being  required  to  comply  with  the
         Immigration Rules which apply to everyone.  His removal to his home
         country cannot be regarded  as  unreasonable  nor  will  it  create
         consequences which can sensibly be considered as unduly  harsh  for
         him.

    27.    Thus, however the Appellant's appeal is analysed, it must fail.

    28.    There was no application for  an  anonymity  direction  and  the
         tribunal sees no need for one.

    DECISION

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.  The tribunal allows the onwards appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, sets aside the original decision  and  remakes  the  original
    decision as follows:

    The appeal is dismissed






    Signed Dated


    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Manuell








    TO THE RESPONDENT
    FEE AWARD

    No appeal fee was paid so there can be no fee award






    Signed Dated
