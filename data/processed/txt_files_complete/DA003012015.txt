For the Appellant:     Mr K Norton
For the Respondent:    Mr A Sesey


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. For ease of reference the parties are hereafter  referred  to  as  they
    were before the First-tier Tribunal so that [AV] is referred to as  the
    appellant.

 2. [AV] is a citizen of Latvia who was born on [ ] 1973.  He  appealed  to
    the First-tier Tribunal (IAC) against the respondent's decision  of  30
    June 2015 to make a deportation order against him under the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  He succeeded in that appeal
    before Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal J M Lewis.

 3. The Secretary of State for the Home  Department  sought  permission  to
    appeal that decision.  Summarising the grounds  seeking  permission  it
    was argued that the judge took the wrong legal approach  regarding  the
    appellant's period of residence in the United Kingdom. Further, it  was
    said to be wrong to find that the appellant had the benefit of enhanced
    protection from deportation from the UK as  he  had  been  continuously
    resident for ten years counting back from  the  date  of  the  relevant
    decision.  Furthermore, the judge did not  engage  with  the  issue  of
    whether the appellant is integrated in the UK, given his offending  and
    imprisonment.

 4. Furthermore, the judge having decided that a decision to  deport  could
    not be taken except on imperative grounds of  public  security  because
    the appellant had resided in the UK for a continuous period of at least
    ten years prior to the relevant decision, that was all that was  needed
    in order to defeat the Secretary of State's  intention  to  deport  the
    appellant.  It was therefore unclear as to why the judge engaged  in  a
    wholly  unnecessary  analysis  of  the  prospects  of   disruption   to
    rehabilitation.  This was said to be (perhaps)  further  evidence  that
    the judge was not clear as  to  the  underlying  law  relating  to  EEA
    deports.

 5. The grounds granting permission were put  very  simply.  It  was  found
    arguable that the judge erred in calculating the appellant's period  of
    residence from prior to his imprisonment  and  not  from  the  date  of
    decision.

 6. The judge found, and was entitled to find, that the appellant has lived
    in the United Kingdom for at least ten  years  prior  to  the  decision
    letter dated 30 June 2015.  Although the respondent has referred to the
    appellant's imprisonment he has in fact  never  been  to  prison  as  a
    result of any criminal activity.  He has been detained but this was  by
    reason of a Hospital Order made in 2011 for detention under the  Mental
    Health Act 1983.  Even then a period of imprisonment during  those  ten
    years - which has not occurred here - does not  necessarily  prevent  a
    person from qualifying  for  enhanced  protection  if  that  person  is
    sufficiently integrated - see MG (prison - Article 28(3)(a) of Citizens
    Directive) [2014] UKUT 392 (IAC).

 7. It is argued that the judge failed to engage with the question  of  the
    appellant's integration, which was clearly put in dispute at paragraphs
    10-11 of the refusal letter, and therefore falls into error by  finding
    that an imperative grounds test was required.

 8. What is not in doubt is that the appellant has resided in the UK for at
    least ten years prior to the decision being taken to deport  him.   The
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v MG (Judgment of the Court)
    [2014] EUECJ C-400/12 interprets Article 28(3)(a) of Directive  2004/38
    as meaning that a period of imprisonment is, in principle,  capable  of
    both interrupting the continuity of the period  of  residence  for  the
    purposes of that provision and of affecting the decision regarding  the
    grant of the enhanced protection provided for  thereunder,  even  where
    the person concerned resided in the host member state for the ten years
    prior to imprisonment.

 9. The case of JO (qualified person - hospital order  -  effect)  Slovakia
    [2012] UKUT 00237/IAC indicates that an EEA national does not cease  to
    be a qualified person as a result  of  being  detained  in  a  hospital
    pursuant to an order of the court under the  Mental  Health  Act  1983,
    having not been convicted  of  any  criminal  offence.   Although  that
    authority was concerned particularly with  the  definition  of  illness
    under Regulation 5(7)(b) and  whether  detention  in  a  secure  mental
    health unit under a compulsory hospital order made by a criminal  court
    is to be treated in the  same  manner  as  detention  during  a  prison
    sentence, the case draws attention to a distinction between  those  who
    are serving a prison sentence  following  conviction  as  a  result  of
    "their own conduct" and those who are unable to work because of illness
    or accident (ï¿½ 27).   Also at paragraph 28:-

         "Other than the bare assertion that  detention  in  a  secure  unit
         should be treated in like manner to  a  prison  sentence  following
         conviction, the Secretary of State's  argument  is  unsupported  by
         authority. In our view there is a fundamental  distinction  between
         these two forms of disposal, each of which may follow precisely the
         same behaviour (in  the  present  case  the  appalling  assault  in
         Hereford in 2006).  The  distinction  is  that  a  prison  sentence
         follows the choice of an individual to act in  a  criminal  manner,
         whereas a Hospital Order results from a finding that the individual
         suffers from a mental disorder  and  is  not  therefore  criminally
         responsible for their otherwise  culpable  behaviour.  We  consider
         that this distinction places those who are  detained  in  a  secure
         mental health unit in  a  completely  different  category,  in  the
         context  of  these  Regulations,  from  those  who  are  imprisoned
         following conviction. That is our conclusion without  reference  to
         the express reference to 'illness' in the  2006  Regulations;  once
         the reference to 'illness' is taken into account,  the  distinction
         between the two contexts is all the more stark.  ...".

10. In this case the appellant  was  convicted  for  assault  but  was  not
    imprisoned.  He became the subject of a Hospital Order made  under  the
    Mental Health Act 1983 and that is the difference.   The  Secretary  of
    State appears to acknowledge that a period  of  imprisonment  does  not
    necessarily interrupt the ten year period of residence if the appellant
    shows that he is sufficiently integrated.  Although the judge  did  not
    specifically  consider  the  matter  of  integration  this  is   almost
    certainly because he did not consider that  this  was  necessary.   The
    appellant had resided in the UK for at least ten years and had not been
    imprisoned as a result of any criminal convictions.   The  respondent's
    argument is, or appears to be, that the  matter  of  integration  -  or
    perhaps lack of it - having been raised in paragraphs 10 and 11 of  the
    decision to make a deportation order it was incumbent upon the judge to
    deal with that aspect and he fell into error by not doing so.

11. There appears to be an interesting argument  which  the  respondent  is
    seeking to develop here to the  effect  that  despite  the  wording  of
    Article 28(3)(a) that  an  expulsion  decision  may  not  be  taken  on
    imperative grounds of public security if the person has resided in  the
    host member state for the previous ten years  there  is  an  overriding
    requirement under the ten year route in any event to show  integration.



12. I consider that I do not need to consider that matter  further  because
    even if the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  should  have  dealt  with  this
    argument I have to decide only whether there is a material error of law
    in the decision such that it should be set aside.

13. The respondent accepts in the said paragraph  10  of  the  decision  to
    deport that the appellant has acquired a permanent right to  reside  by
    virtue of five years of continuous residence in accordance with the EEA
    Regulations.  Article 28(2) of the 2004/38  Directive  shows  that  the
    host member state may not take  an  expulsion  decision  against  union
    citizens who have the right of permanent  residence  on  its  territory
    except on serious grounds of public policy or public security.  On  any
    view the judge made clear findings  which  led  to  his  conclusion  at
    paragraph 38 of his decision that the conduct of the appellant does not
    represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting
    one of the fundamental interests of society. The judge's findings could
    not have led to any decision other than  the  one  to  which  he  came.
    Therefore an expulsion decision on serious grounds of public policy  or
    public security was not appropriate.

14.  For these reasons I am  drawn  (inevitably)  to  the  conclusion  that
    whatever errors there may be in the decision they are not such as would
    have led to another decision had the judge applied the  law  correctly.
    Mr Norton on behalf of the respondent did not seek seriously  to  argue
    otherwise.

15. In all the circumstances therefore the decision of the First-tier Judge
    is upheld.

16.  No  anonymity  direction  was  sought  or  is  required  in  all   the
    circumstances of this case.
