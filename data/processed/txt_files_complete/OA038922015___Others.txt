Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms M Bayoumi instructed by Petersons Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I make an anonymity order to protect  the  identity
    of the second and third appellants who area children.  Unless the Upper
    Tribunal or court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly identify the appellants.   This  direction
    applies to both the appellants and to the respondent and a  failure  to
    comply with this direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

Introduction

 2. The first appellant, who was born on 4 July 1970, is the mother of  the
    second and third appellants who were born respectively on  23  November
    2008 and 16  October  2010.   All  three  appellants  are  citizens  of
    Pakistan.

 3. The appellants applied for entry clearance to join the sponsor  ("WA"),
    who is a British citizen and is the husband of the first appellant  and
    father of the second and third appellants.  The applications were  made
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 4. On 21 January 2015, the Entry Clearance Officer  at  Islamabad  refused
    each of the applications.

 5. As regards each of the appellants, the ECO was not satisfied  that  the
    sponsor had established that he had the required  income,  as  a  self-
    employed taxi driver in the UK, of �24,800 as required by E-ECP.3.1  of
    Appendix FM.  The  ECO  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellants  had
    submitted the required bank statements from the  sponsor  covering  the
    same 12-month period as his tax return as required by  paras  7(e)  and
    (f) of Appendix FM-SE.  In addition, in  relation  to  the  second  and
    third appellants the ECO was not satisfied that the evidence  establish
    their parental relationship with the sponsor.

 6. On 16  April  2015,  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  upheld  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decisions.

 7. Despite the appellants having submitted further documents, namely birth
    certificates the ECM was still not satisfied that the second and  third
    appellants were the sponsor's children.

 8. As regards the financial requirements, the appellants submitted to  the
    ECM a full set of the sponsor's bank statements covering  the  relevant
    12-month period for the financial year ending April 2014.  However,  as
    the  statements  only  showed  deposits  totalling  �14,940,  the   ECM
    concluded that the ECO had been correct to decide that  the  appellants
    had  not  shown  that  the  sponsor,  on  the  basis  of  the  required
    documentation under Appendix FM-SE, had established that he had  earned
    at least �24,800 in that relevant 12-month period.

 9. As a result, the ECM upheld the ECO's  decisions  that  the  appellants
    could not succeed under Appendix FM.  In addition,  the  ECM  concluded
    that the refusal of entry clearance did not breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

10. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.   No  oral  hearing
    was requested and, as a consequence, the appeals were determined on the
    papers.  In a decision promulgated on 29 September 2015, Judge  Bircher
    dismissed each of the appeals.

11. Judge Bircher accepted that the second and third  appellants  were  the
    sponsor's children.   No  further  issue  arises  in  respect  of  that
    finding.

12. However, Judge Bircher  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellants  had
    established, on the basis of the specified evidence in Appendix  FM-SE,
    that the sponsor earned the required  amount  of  �24,800  as  a  self-
    employed taxi driver.

13. First, Judge Bircher acknowledged that the  sponsor's  bank  statements
    showed that he earned an income of �14,950  which  was  less  than  his
    claimed income for the relevant  12-month  period  but  that  this  was
    explicable because he was paid in cash and he inevitably held back cash
    for household expenses only paying the balance into his account.  Judge
    Bircher concluded that it was not  necessary  for  the  sponsor's  bank
    statement to reflect the exact amount of money he claimed to earn,  and
    which was disclosed by the other documents submitted, for the  relevant
    year.  It would appear that Judge Bircher found that, despite the  bank
    statements only reflecting an income of �14,950, that nevertheless that
    document met the requirements in para 7(f) of Appendix FM-SE.

14. Secondly, however, Judge Bircher found that the appellants  had  failed
    to  produce  the  required  documents  in  para  7(h)(bb),  namely  the
    sponsor's  annual  unaudited  accounts  for  the  last  financial  year
    together with an accountant's certificate of confirmation.

15. As a result, Judge Bircher found that the appellants had failed to meet
    the financial requirements of Appendix FM in E-ECP.3.1 on the basis  of
    the specified evidence set out in Appendix FM-SE.

16. In addition, Judge Bircher dismissed the appellants' appeals under  Art
    8.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

17. The appellants sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the
    basis that the judge had erred in law in concluding that the appellants
    did not meet the requirements of the Rules because they had  failed  to
    produce  the  documentation  required  by  para  7(h)(bb),  namely  the
    sponsor's annual unaudited accounts for the last  full  financial  year
    and  an  accountant's  certificate.   The  grounds  argued  that  those
    documents  were,  indeed,  submitted  with  the   appellants'   initial
    applications as listed at point 22 of  the  listed  "attached  relevant
    documents" with the application.  The grounds also refer  to  the  fact
    that  the  appellants  had  submitted  the  sponsor's  bank  statements
    corresponding to the 12-month period  correlating  with  the  unaudited
    accounts for the tax year 2013/14.

18. On 2 June 2016, the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Landes)  granted  the
    appellants permission to appeal on the basis that it was arguable  that
    the required unaudited accounts and accountant's certificate  had  been
    submitted with  the  appellants'  applications  to  the  ECO  and  were
    available to the judge.  Judge Landes raised, however, in  her  grounds
    the possibility that  the  judge  had  wrongly  applied  para  7(f)  of
    Appendix FM-SE in concluding that the bank statements  of  the  sponsor
    satisfy the Rules.

19. On 12 June 2016, the Entry Clearance Officer filed a rule  24  response
    seeking to uphold the First-tier Tribunal's decision on the basis  that
    the appellants had failed to provide the necessary documentation  under
    Appendix FM-SE to establish that they met the financial requirement  in
    E-ECP.3.1 of Appendix FM.

20. Thus, the appeals came before me.

The Relevant Requirements of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE

21. Section E-ECP.3.1(a) requires that, in the case of the first appellant,
    that she

         "must provide  specified  evidence,  from  the  sources  listed  in
         paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of -

         (a)  a specified gross annual income of at least -

             (i)  �18,600;

             (ii)     an additional �3,800 for the first child; and

             (iii)    an additional �2,400 for each additional child; ..."

22. E-ECP.3.2. requires, for the purposes of these appeals, that the source
    of the income be the income of the sponsor  from  his  self-employment.
    The effect of E-ECP.3.1(a) is that the appellants must  establish  that
    the sponsor has a gross annual income from  his  self-employment  as  a
    taxi driver of �24,800.  That is not disputed in these appeals.

23. The income must, however, be established by "specified evidence" as set
    out in Appendix FM-SE.  Paragraph A1 of Appendix  FM-SE  sets  out  the
    general provision that:

         "to meet the financial requirement under paragraphs E-ECP.3.1.,  E-
         LTRP.3.1., E-ECC.2.1. and E-LTRC.2.1. of Appendix FM the  applicant
         must meet:

         (a)   The  level  of  financial  requirement  applicable   to   the
             application under Appendix FM; and

         (b)  The requirements specified in Appendix FM and this Appendix as
             to:

             (i)  the permitted sources of income and savings;

             (ii)      the  time  periods  and  permitted  combinations  of
                  sources applicable to each permitted source  relied  upon;
                  and

             (iii)    the  evidence  required  for  each  permitted  source
                  relied upon."

24. It is clear, and indeed it is not disputed, that  each  appellant  must
    satisfy the applicable requirements of Appendix FM and that  they  must
    do so on the basis of the "specified evidence" set out in Appendix  FM-
    SE.

25. The only live issue in these appeals is the "financial requirements" in
    Appendix FM.  The sponsor is  self-employed  and,  therefore,  the  key
    provisions are contained within para 7 of Appendix FM-SE:

         "In respect of self-employment in the UK as a partner,  as  a  sole
         trader or in a franchise all of the following must be provided:

         (a)  Evidence of the amount of tax payable, paid and unpaid for the
             last full financial year.

         (b)  The following documents for the last full financial  year,  or
             for the last two such years (where those  documents  show  the
             necessary level of gross income as an  average  of  those  two
             years):

             (i)  annual self-assessment tax return  to  HMRC  (a  copy  or
                  print-out); and

             (ii)     Statement of Account (SA300 or SA302).

         (c)  Proof of registration with HMRC as self-employed if available.

         (d)  Each partner's Unique Tax Reference Number  (UTR)  and/or  the
             UTR of the partnership or business.

         (e)  Where the person  holds  or  held  a  separate  business  bank
             account(s), bank statements for the same  12-month  period  as
             the tax return(s).

         (f)  Personal bank statements for the same 12-month period  as  the
             tax return(s) showing that the income from self-employment has
             been paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the
             name of the person and their partner jointly.

         (g)   Evidence  of  ongoing  self-employment  through  evidence  of
             payment of Class 2 National Insurance contributions, or (where
             the person has reached state pension age) through  alternative
             evidence (which may include, but is not confined to,  evidence
             of  ongoing  payment  of  business   rates,   business-related
             insurance premiums, employer National Insurance  contributions
             or franchise payments to the parent company).

         (h)  One of the following documents must also be submitted:

             (i)(aa)  If the business is required to produce annual audited
                    accounts, such accounts  for  the  last  full  financial
                    year; or

             (bb)     If the business is not  required  to  produce  annual
                    audited accounts, unaudited accounts for the  last  full
                    financial  year  and  an  accountant's  certificate   of
                    confirmation, from an accountant who is a member of a UK
                    Recognised Supervisory Body (as defined in the Companies
                    Act 2006) or  who  is  a  member  of  the  Institute  of
                    Financial Accountants;

             (ii)     A certificate of VAT registration and the VAT  return
                    for the last full financial year (a copy  or  print-out)
                    confirming the VAT registration number, if  turnover  is
                    in excess of �79,000 or was in excess of  the  threshold
                    which applied during the last full financial year;

             (iii)    Evidence to show appropriate planning  permission  or
                    local planning authority consent is held to operate  the
                    type/class of business at  the  trading  address  (where
                    this is a local authority requirement); or

             (iv)     A franchise agreement signed by both parties.

         (i)  The  document  referred  to  in  paragraph  7(h)(iv)  must  be
             provided if the organisation is a franchise." (emphasis added)

26. The relevant provisions in these appeals are those italicised above and
    contained within para 7(f) relating  to  the  sponsor's  personal  bank
    statements and para 7(h)(bb) in relation to his unaudited accounts.

The Submissions

27. Mr Richards, who represented the ECO, accepted that Judge  Bircher  had
    been in  error  in  finding  that  the  appellants  did  not  meet  the
    requirement in para 7(h)(bb) of Appendix SE-FM because he accepted that
    the appellants had submitted the required  unaudited  accounts  of  the
    sponsor for the tax year 2013/14 and a letter of confirmation from  his
    accountants.  That material, Mr Richards  accepted,  was  before  Judge
    Bircher and met the requirement in para 7(h)(bb).

28. As a consequence, the submissions before me focused  on  whether  Judge
    Bircher had correctly found that the sponsor's bank statements, despite
    disclosing only an income of �14,950, nevertheless met the  requirement
    in para 7(f) of Appendix FM-SE.

29. On behalf of the appellants, Ms Bayoumi submitted  that  there  was  no
    need for the sponsor's bank statement to show  his  full  self-employed
    income.  She submitted that where  an  individual's  income  was  cash-
    based, as was the sponsor's, there was a  different  requirement  under
    Appendix FM-SE for an employed person paid in cash and a  self-employed
    person such as the sponsor paid in cash.

30. In support of that submission, Ms Bayoumi prayed in  aid  the  relevant
    IDI ("family migration: Appendix FM Section 1.7: Financial Requirement,
    May 2006).  She relied upon para 3.1.5 which is in the following terms:



         "Under paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE the  gross  amount  of  any
         cash income may  be  counted  where  the  person's  specified  bank
         statements show the deposit of the full net amount which relates to
         the gross amount shown  on  their  payslips  (or  in  the  relevant
         specified evidence provided  in  addition  to  the  specified  bank
         statements in relation to non-employment income).  Otherwise,  only
         the net amount shown  on  the  specified  bank  statements  may  be
         counted.  Those wishing to  rely  on  cash  income  to  sponsor  an
         application subject to the financial requirement may need to change
         the way they manage their money and bank the  full  net  amount  so
         that they can then rely on the  gross  amount  of  that  income  in
         sponsoring the application.  Like the other evidential requirements
         of Appendix FM-SE which seek  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  the
         system for all genuine applicants and  sponsors,  it  is  important
         that those wishing to rely on the gross amount of their cash income
         from  employment  corroborate  this  income  through   their   bank
         statements,  as  well  as  the  required  payslips  and  employer's
         letter."

31. Ms Bayoumi submitted that an employee paid in cash had to  deposit  the
    full net amount (as shown in his payslips) in order to be able to  rely
    upon the "gross" amount of cash income  set  out  in  the  payslips  in
    seeking to meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM.  Ms  Bayoumi
    submitted that, by contrast, no like provision could be  found  in  the
    IDI in section 9 dealing with self-employed income.  As a  consequence,
    Ms  Bayoumi  submitted  that  it  sufficed  that  the  sponsor's   bank
    statements showed that some of his self-employed  income  (received  in
    cash) had been paid into his bank account over  the  relevant  12-month
    period even though  it  was  not  the  full  amount  disclosed  by  his
    unaudited account and, as I understood her submission, even though what
    was shown in the bank statements did not rise to the required level  of
    income under Appendix FM which, for these appellants, was �24,800.

32. Ms Bayoumi submitted that, otherwise, a self-employed sponsor would  be
    required to deposit all his cash income in his account  in  order  that
    the required bank statements would comply with para 7(f).   Ms  Bayoumi
    submitted, in effect, that there was an innate difference between  sole
    traders operating a cash business and salaried employees paid in cash.

33. In addition, Ms Bayoumi referred  me  to  the  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal  in  Sultana  and  Others  (Rules:   waiver/further   enquiry;
    discretion) [2014] UKUT 00540 (IAC) which, she  informed  me,  was  the
    only relevant case dealing with the position of self-employed sponsors.
     I was not provided with  a  copy  of  the  decision  at  the  hearing,
    although I have subsequently obtained  one,  but  as  I  understood  Ms
    Bayoumi's submission it was that the UT  in  Sultana  had  contemplated
    reliance upon bank statements of a  self-employed  person  even  though
    they did not disclose his full income.

34. Mr Richards submitted that it was not necessarily  helpful  to  compare
    the Rules applicable  to  employed  persons  and  those  self-employed.
    Obviously, he submitted, an employed person paid in  cash  could  never
    show that their "gross income" was paid into their  bank  account.   By
    contrast, a self-employed person received their "gross"  and  so  could
    pay all of  their  income  into  their  bank  account.   Initially,  Mr
    Richards submitted that para 7(f) would only be satisfied if  the  bank
    statements showed all of the sponsor's income from self-employment  and
    not merely "some" of that income.  However, when I  sought  to  clarify
    whether that was his submission, Mr Richards stepped back somewhat  and
    submitted that it was not necessary for a sponsor to  pay  in  all  his
    self-employed cash income but he must pay in (and  therefore  his  bank
    statements disclose) at least enough to meet the financial requirements
    of the Rules.  Here, the sponsor's  bank  statements  fell  below  that
    required level.

Discussion

35. The "specified evidence" required for  sponsors  who  are  in  salaried
    employment and those who are self-employed set out in Appendix FM-SE at
    paras 2 and 7 are necessarily different, at least, to some extent.  For
    example, a  person  in  salaried  employment  is  required  to  produce
    "payslips" for a required period prior to the date of application  (see
    para 2(a) and (b)).  By contrast, a person in self-employment will have
    no payslips but must, instead, produce appropriate documentation for  a
    self-employed person  such  as  statements  of  account,  annual  self-
    assessment tax returns and audited or unaudited account (see para  7(b)
    and (h)).  However, for both types of income, both para 2(c)  and  para
    7(e) and (f) require production of bank statements corresponding to the
    relevant period to the payslips for an employee  or  for  the  12-month
    period for the required tax return  in  the  case  of  a  self-employed
    person.  Consequently, in relation to salaried employment para 2(c)  of
    Appendix SE-FM states that the following must be produced:

         "Personal bank statements corresponding to the  same  period(s)  as
         the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the  salary  has  been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or the name  of  the
         person and their partner jointly."

36. The equivalent provision in para 7(f) in relation  to  a  self-employed
    person provides that there must be produced:

          "Personal bank statements for the same 12-month period as the  tax
         return(s) showing that the income  from  self-employment  had  been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the  name  of
         the person and their partner jointly."

37. The equivalent provision for "business bank accounts" is found in  para
    7(e) but is not relevant to these appeals.

38. There is, therefore, no distinction between the documentary evidence in
    terms of bank statements that must be produced whether  the  source  of
    the income is an employed or self-employed person.

39. Ms Bayoumi placed weight upon para 3.1.5 of the IDI which  I  have  set
    out above.  That, in effect, replicates at para 1(n) of Appendix  FM-SE
    which states as follows:

         "The gross amount of any cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the
         person specified bank statements show the net amount which  relates
         to the gross amount shown on their payslips  (or  in  the  relevant
         specified evidence provided  in  addition  to  the  specified  bank
         statements in relation to non-employment income).  Otherwise,  only
         the net amount shown  on  the  specified  bank  statements  may  be
         counted."

40. The reference to "non-employment  income"  is  not  to  "self-employed-
    income" but rather is to income derived from sources such  as  property
    rental, dividend and interest (see s.6 of the IDI).

41. The purpose of para 1(n), in the case of an  employed  person  paid  in
    cash, is that it allows an individual to rely upon their "gross" income
    (as set out in their payslips) provided their full "net" cash income is
    paid into their bank account and is, therefore,  shown  on  their  bank
    statements and correlates to that shown on  their  payslips.   Were  it
    otherwise, an employed person would never be able to demonstrate  their
    "gross" income through their bank statements as their salary (even when
    paid in cash) would necessarily be paid net of tax.

42. That provision, by its own terms, has no application to a self-employed
    person paid in cash.  It does not, however, necessarily require that an
    employed person may not rely upon what  is,  in  fact,  paid  into  his
    account (and therefore shown on his bank statements) if his full  "net"
    income is not paid in.  The terms of para 1(n) are simply  that  unless
    the full net amount is paid in (correlating with his payslips) he  will
    not be able to rely upon  the  "grossed  up"  figure  representing  his
    income paid in cash and disclosed on his payslip.   Instead,  only  the
    figure shown on his bank statements can be considered, perhaps somewhat
    artificially, as representing his "gross" income.  That is  made  clear
    in para 3.1.5 of the IDI itself  and  the  example  given  in  the  IDI
    immediately following para 3.1.5 as follows:

         "The prospective sponsor of an application for entry clearance as a
         partner is in non-salaried employment with a construction  firm  in
         the UK.  He is paid weekly in cash and  receives  payslips  showing
         this net income, together with the gross  amount  and  the  correct
         deductions for tax and National Insurance.  He  currently  deposits
         around half of his net income in his bank  account  each  week  and
         uses the remainder of the cash to pay his  rent  and  some  of  his
         living expenses.  He will need instead  to  bank  all  of  his  net
         income each week so that this  income  is  reflected  in  his  bank
         statements for a period of at least 6 months prior to the  date  of
         application in order to be able to rely on the gross amount of this
         employment income in sponsoring his partner's application.  Failure
         to do this would mean that the unbanked cash income  could  not  be
         counted  towards  meeting  the  financial  requirement."  (emphasis
         added)

43. As that example makes plain, the  actual  income  paid  into  the  bank
    account (and disclosed on the bank statement) if it falls short of  the
    full "net  income"  of  the  employee  will  be  the  figure  taken  as
    representing the employee's income  (indeed  "gross  income")  for  the
    purposes of Appendix FM.  Only if the  full  net  income  is  paid  in,
    tallying with the figures in the payslips, can the employee  rely  upon
    his true "gross" income.

44. As para 1(n) does not, as I have already noted, apply  to  a  sponsor's
    self-employed income, there is therefore no provision  allowing  for  a
    "deemed" grossing up of any cash income paid into a bank account  by  a
    self-employed person.  That, in my judgment, is the relevant point that
    can be directly gleaned from the terms of para 1(n) in  relation  to  a
    self-employed person who is paid in cash and is relying upon  his  bank
    statements.  I recognise, as Ms Bayoumi submitted, that in the case  of
    a self-employed person it is likely that their practical  arrangements,
    when paid in cash, may well involve not paying the full amount of their
    income (necessarily the "gross" amount) into their account.  The  judge
    recognised that was what had happened in relation  to  the  sponsor  in
    this  case  in  para  10  of  her  determination.   However,  the  same
    practicality may well arise in relation to an employed  person  who  is
    paid in cash who may choose not to pay the full amount of their  income
    received (necessarily  here  "net"  of  tax)  into  their  account  for
    precisely the same reasons.  The need  for  the  deemed  "grossing  up"
    provision in the case of an employed person paid in cash is, of course,
    not absolutely essential for a self-employed person  who  does  receive
    his income in cash in full, i.e. "gross".  That may  well  explain  why
    there is no equivalent provision  to  para  1(n)  for  a  self-employed
    person.

45. Para 1(n) takes the argument no further in my judgment.  But the  point
    recognised in the guidance about the position when the full cash amount
    is not paid into the account does resonate for  self-employed  persons.
    Bearing in mind that the requirement to produce bank statements showing
    that the income (whether from employment or self-employment)  has  been
    paid into the account is the same for both  an  employee  and  a  self-
    employed person in para 2(c) and para 7(f) respectively of Appendix FM-
    SE, when paid in cash a self-employed person  should  be  in  no  worse
    position than an employed person such that, if the full amount of their
    self-employed income is not paid into their account, the  self-employed
    person can rely upon what is paid into their account as representing an
    income figure relevant  to  an  assessment  of  whether  the  financial
    requirements in Appendix FM are met.  The cask amount paid in and shown
    in the bank statements will  represent  the  "gross  income"  that  the
    individual will be able to establish by those documents.

46. It was not ultimately Mr Richards' submission that only if the totality
    of the cash income of a self-employed  person  was  paid  into  a  bank
    account (and consequently disclosed on the bank statements) would it be
    that the bank statements would comply  with  the  requirement  in  para
    7(f).  That position seems to be to be correct.  It,  in  my  judgment,
    accords with common-sense and follows by analogy to the  Home  Office's
    own guidance in  relation  to  employed  persons  paid  in  cash.   If,
    however, the full amount is not paid in then the  individual  can  only
    rely upon that part of his cash income set out in the  bank  statements
    as representing his "gross" income for the purposes  of  the  financial
    requirements in Appendix FM.

47. However, it is not necessary in these appeals to reach a concluded view
    on whether the full amount must be paid  in  because,  inevitably,  the
    amount paid in by the sponsor in these appeals, and shown on  his  bank
    statements, does not reach the required  level  of  �24,800.   Even  if
    payment of less than the full  amount  of  the  cash  income  into  the
    sponsor's account  was  not  required,  I  do  not  accept  Ms  Bayoumi
    submission that, in effect, because the bank statements  disclose  some
    of the sponsor's self-employed income they satisfy the  requirement  in
    para 7(f).  The whole  point  of  the  financial  documentation  is  to
    establish that the appellants meet the financial  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  That means demonstrate a gross  income  of  at  least  �24,800.
    Bank statements which do not do that would, in effect, be pointless  as
    evidential documents.  They must, in my judgment,  establish  that  the
    sponsor had the required income.

48. Ms Bayoumi referred me to the case  of  Sultana.   However,  that  case
    sheds little or no light on the point in issue in  these  appeals.   It
    was accepted in that case by the applicant's legal representatives that
    the submitted bank statements did not comply with the Rules.  The case,
    instead, raised the issue of "evidential flexibility" and  the  appeals
    were  dismissed.   Having  read  and  re-read  the   Upper   Tribunal's
    determination, I am unable to  discern  any  relevant  discussion  that
    sheds light upon the proper application of para 7(f).

49. For these reasons,  therefore,  Judge  Bircher  erred  in  law  in  her
    application of para 7(h)(bb) in relation  to  the  sponsor's  unaudited
    accounts and accompanying accountant's certification.  The  requirement
    in para 7(h)(bb) was met.

50. Further, as properly raised in the rule 24 notice, the judge also erred
    in  law  in  finding  that  the  sponsor's  bank  statements  met   the
    requirement in para 7(f).  Even though they did not disclose  the  full
    gross cash income of the sponsor, they failed  to  disclose  an  income
    sufficient to meet the requirements of Appendix FM  applicable  to  the
    three appellants.  For that reason, albeit a different  one  from  that
    given by the judge, the appellants' appeals fell to be dismissed  under
    the Immigration Rules.

51. Neither in the grounds nor in Ms Bayoumi's submissions  was  there  any
    challenge to the judge's decision to dismiss  the  appellants'  appeals
    under Art 8.  The judge's decisions in that regard, therefore, stand.

Decision

52. The decisions of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  each  of  the
    appellants' appeals involved the  making  of  an  error  of  law.   The
    decisions are set aside.

53. For the reasons I have given, I remake the decisions dismissing each of
    the appellants' appeals under the Immigration Rules.

54. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss each of  the  appellants'
    appeals under Art 8 stands.
