For the Secretary of State:     Mr S Kandola, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Ms Pararajsingham, Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal  against  the
    decision by the Secretary of State to  refuse  to  vary  her  leave  to
    remain. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order, and  I
    do not consider that such an order is warranted for  these  proceedings
    in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant is a national of Zambia, whose date of birth is  1  August
    1966.  She entered the UK on 22 July 2005 with a visa  as  a  voluntary
    worker which was valid until 7 July 2006.   She  successfully  extended
    her stay in the United Kingdom as a student, a student nurse and  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student.  Her last grant of leave to remain as a  Tier
    4 (General) Student was made on 20 December 2011 for a  period  of  two
    years.  On 29 August 2012 she made an application for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student.   The  application  was  refused  on  15
    October 2012 as the Secretary of State was not satisfied that her  Tier
    4 sponsor had confirmed that the course for  which  her  CAS  had  been
    assigned represented academic progression from her previous  study,  or
    met one of the exemptions.  But she was not entitled to appeal  against
    the decision, as she still had leave to remain.

 3. Her existing leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student  was  curtailed  on  4
    December 2012.  Following consideration of further  representations  on
    her behalf, the decision to refuse her application was  maintained  and
    she was given a new curtailment date of 2 February 2013.

 4. On 21 December 2012 the claimant applied  for  discretionary  leave  to
    remain.  In her application form, she said she was not currently  in  a
    relationship.  But her only child was present in the UK as a student.

 5. On 23 April 2013 the Secretary of State gave her reasons  for  refusing
    the application.  Her application to remain had been  determined  under
    Rule 276ADE of the Rules by virtue of Rule 326B.   She  had  not  lived
    continuously in the UK  for  at  least  twenty  years  since  initially
    entering the United Kingdom on 15  July  2006.   At  the  time  of  her
    application she was aged  46.   Having  spent  39  years  in  her  home
    country, in the absence of any evidence to the  contrary,  it  was  not
    accepted that in the period of time that she had been in the UK she had
    lost ties to her home country.  The family life  that  she  claimed  to
    have with relatives in the United Kingdom  did  not  constitute  family
    life as  determined  in  Appendix  FM  of  the  Rules.   Therefore  her
    application had been considered as a claim for private life only.

 6. Her case had also been considered on an exceptional basis  outside  the
    Rules.  The  Secretary  of  State  did  not  consider  there  were  any
    exceptional, compassionate or compelling  circumstances  to  take  into
    account, and therefore she was not prepared to exercise  discretion  in
    her favour.  It would undermine the purposes of the immigration  system
    relating to Tier 4 (General) Students should the appellant  be  granted
    leave to remain outside the Rules purely for the reason that she  could
    not meet the requirements of the Tier 4 Student Rules.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Seifert sitting at Hatton Cross
    in the First-tier Tribunal on  12  December  2013.   Ms  Pararajsingham
    appeared on behalf of the claimant, and Ms Jacob, Counsel, appeared  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State.

 8. At the outset of the hearing, Ms Jacob withdrew the decision to  remove
    the claimant made under  Section  47.   So  the  hearing  proceeded  in
    respect  of  the  substantive  decision  to   refuse   the   claimant's
    application for variation of leave to remain.

 9. The claimant relied on her  relationship  with  her  partner,  Mr  Paul
    Dixon.  She had met him in August 2012 whilst shopping.  They were in a
    relationship by November 2012, and had started cohabiting  in  December
    2012.  She said that she and Mr Dixon had formed a strong  and  durable
    relationship, particularly over  the  last  year.   She  had  a  loving
    relationship with his grown up children and his grandchildren.  She and
    Mr Dixon had the same social network, and enjoyed each other's company.
     They were cohabiting with the intention of getting married.  She was a
    Christian with strong religious faith.  When asked when they planned to
    get married, she said "not too long".

10. She said if she was removed from the UK this would cause Mr  Dixon  and
    his family much distress, and would put a strain on their relationship.
     She could not bear the thought of being separated from  Mr  Dixon  and
    his family.

11. In re-examination, the claimant said she had been talking about  Zambia
    when she had answered question 6.10 of the application form.  What  she
    was saying was that she was not in a  relationship  with  a  person  in
    Zambia  in  December  2012.   Earlier  she  had  explained  in   cross-
    examination that she had not mentioned Mr Dixon in the application form
    as she did not want to look as if she was using him in order to stay in
    the UK.

12. Mr Dixon was called as a witness, and he said that he intended to marry
    the claimant during the next two years.  There was no particular reason
    for waiting that long, except that it seemed a  reasonable  time  after
    his late wife had passed away, which was on 29 March  2010.   They  had
    been married for 41 years.  He said he had not thought  he  would  have
    another relationship, but he had found and  fallen  in  love  with  the
    claimant.

13. In her closing submissions, Ms  Pararajsingham  said  it  was  not  the
    claimant's case that  she  met  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  or
    paragraph 276ADE of the Rules.  However, applying Article 8  case  law,
    the claimant's studies and  her  relationship  with  Mr  Dixon  engaged
    Article 8 on family and/or  private  life  grounds.   The  respondent's
    decision  constituted  a   disproportionate   interference   with   the
    claimant's Article 8 rights.

14. At paragraph 57 of her determination, the judge held as follows:

         Having considered the evidence as a whole  and  having  considered,
         amongst other authorities, R (Razgar) v SSHD  [2004]  UKHL  27  and
         Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39, I have reached a conclusion that
         the   respondent's   decision   constitutes   a    disproportionate
         interference with Ms Milimo's right to private and family life.  In
         reaching this conclusion I have also taken into account the  rights
         of Mr Dixon to private and family life  with  Ms  Milimo.   On  the
         particular facts of this case  I  consider  that  this  couple  has
         established a relationship engaging Article 8.  As described in her
         evidence they met by chance in  August  2012.   At  that  stage  Ms
         Milimo had leave to remain in the UK  until  the  end  of  December
         2013.  Mr Dixon had been married for over 40 years when he lost his
         wife in tragic circumstances.  He has  two  sons,  daughters-in-law
         and grandchildren.  All of them live in the UK.  He thought that he
         would never have another relationship, but  despite  this,  met  Ms
         Milimo and they have established [a] loving relationship and a  new
         life together.  The relationship is accepted by his family.

15. The judge went on to observe that they had both expressed an  intention
    to marry.  She did not consider it was reasonable to expect Mr Dixon, a
    British citizen, to leave his children and grandchildren  and  all  his
    established ties in the UK, in order to move to Zambia with Ms  Milimo.
    She continued:

         It may be that Ms Milimo continues her studies at some point in the
         future.  However, I do not consider her studies would have  engaged
         Article 8 private life, and base this decision on the  relationship
         established between Ms Milimo and Mr Dixon.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

16. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal,  arguing  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge had erred in law in her approach  to  the
    Article 8 assessment.  MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 confirmed that
    the Rules were a complete code that formed the starting point  for  the
    decision maker.  Any Article 8 assessment should  only  be  made  after
    consideration under the Rules.  That was not done in  this  case.   The
    Tribunal had erred in law by not having regard to  the  Rules  and  the
    subsequent proportionality assessment was unsustainable because of this
    omission.  Furthermore it was made clear in Gulshan [2013]  UKUT  00640
    (IAC) that the Article 8 assessment should only  be  carried  out  when
    there were compelling circumstances not recognised by  the  Rules.   In
    this  case,  the  Tribunal   had   not   identified   such   compelling
    circumstances and its findings  were  therefore  unsustainable.   Nagre
    [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) endorsed the Secretary of State's  guidance  on
    the minimum exceptional circumstances, namely ones where refusal  would
    lead to an unjustifiably harsh outcome.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

17. On  15  April  2014  Judge  Pirotta  granted  the  Secretary  of  State
    permission to appeal on the grounds raised in the application.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

18. At the hearing in the Upper Tribunal, I received submissions from  both
    parties as to whether the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did,  or
    did not, contain an error of law.  I ruled in the Secretary of  State's
    favour on this issue, and my reasons for finding an error  of  law  are
    set out below.  At my invitation, Mr Dixon was called as a  witness  to
    give evidence relevant to the remaking of the decision.




Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

19. An error of law is made out for the reasons given  in  the  application
    for permission.  It was not enough for the  judge  to  acknowledge  the
    concession made by Ms Pararajsingham that  the  appellant's  Article  8
    claim did not succeed under Appendix  FM.   The  judge  needed  to  ask
    herself why the claimant did not qualify for leave to remain under  the
    partner route contained in Appendix FM, as the answer to that  question
    might well be decisive of the Article 8 claim.  The  judge  should  not
    have gone on to consider whether the claimant succeeded in an Article 8
    claim outside the Rules unless satisfied that the claim  met  the  high
    threshold test propounded by Sales J in  Nagre,  and  approved  by  the
    Upper Tribunal in Gulshan.

20. The proportionality assessment was also flawed in that the  judge  only
    considered the question  of  permanent  resettlement  by  Mr  Dixon  in
    Zambia.  The judge did not consider at all whether it was proportionate
    to require the claimant to return to Zambia on a temporary basis,  with
    a view to Mr Dixon supporting an application by her for entry clearance
    as his spouse or as his fianc�e.

The Remaking of the Decision

21. The claimant cannot avail herself of the partner route in Appendix  FM,
    as Mr Dixon does not meet the definition of a partner contained in  GEN
    1.2.  This provides that for the  purposes  of  Appendix  FM  "partner"
    means - (i) the applicant's spouse; (ii) the applicant's civil partner;
    (iii) the applicant's fianc� or  proposed  civil  partner;  or  (iv)  a
    person  who  has  been  living  together  with  the  applicant   in   a
    relationship akin to marriage or civil partnership  for  at  least  two
    years prior to the date of application, unless  the  context  otherwise
    requires.

22. As of  the  date  of  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    relationship between the claimant and Mr Dixon had  not  progressed  to
    one of a spouse or fianc�.  One of the reasons for this is referred  to
    earlier in this determination.  In addition, Mr Dixon explained  to  me
    that he did not want their marriage to be perceived  as  being  one  of
    convenience.  However, now that he realised that he would be treated as
    a partner under Appendix FM  if  he  became  formally  engaged  to  the
    claimant, he was ready to take that step.

23. I also asked Mr Dixon about his financial circumstances.   He  said  he
    owned the house where they lived.  He had cash savings  in  a  building
    society of �100,000, and  he  was  the  beneficiary  of  three  private
    pensions which yielded a total of about �30,000 per annum.  He  had  no
    dependants, apart from the claimant, as all his children were grown  up
    and were independent.

24. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Kandola does  not  dispute  the
    finding of the First-tier Tribunal Judge that the claimant and Mr Dixon
    are living together in a  relationship  akin  to  marriage;  that  they
    intend to get married in the near future; and that they intend to  live
    permanently with each other as husband  and  wife.   But,  as  he  also
    submits, I must assess the Article 8  claim  as  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing.  The relationship between the claimant and Mr Dixon  does  not
    give rise to a viable claim under Appendix FM.

25. Applying Gulshan, it is only if there may be arguably good grounds  for
    granting leave to remain outside the Rules that  it  is  necessary  for
    Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether  there  are  compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.  I find there are
    not arguably good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Rules, as the claimant has the clear option of  making  an  application
    for leave to remain within the Rules.  She  does  not  face  a  removal
    decision, as the Section 47 decision has been withdrawn.  Moreover, she
    will not fall into the category of an overstayer  until  28  days  have
    elapsed from  the  date  when  her  appeal  rights  are  deemed  to  be
    exhausted.   So  provided  the  in-country  application  is  made  with
    reasonable expedition, the claimant will not need to go back to  Zambia
    to apply for entry clearance as Mr Dixon's fianc�e.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the claimant's appeal against the refusal by the  Secretary  of
State to vary her leave to remain is dismissed.
