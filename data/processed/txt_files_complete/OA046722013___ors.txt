Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms K Reid of Counsel, instructed by Christopher
                    Matthews Solicitors
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer  Islamabad  against  a
    decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  appeal  of  the
    respondents, whom I will call the "claimants", against  a  decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer refusing them entry clearance to the United
    Kingdom.

 2. Essentially they are the dependent relatives of a person settled in the
    United Kingdom and they could be allowed to join him subject  to  other
    conditions if they  can  show  there  is  sufficient  money  for  their
    maintenance.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge decided there was sufficient money but it
    is I think common ground that he made two mistakes.

 4. Firstly he did not show in his analysis that he appreciated that  money
    had to be in the form of capital held for at least  six  months  before
    the date of decision and secondly when deciding how  much  capital  was
    needed he did his sums wrong and  although  purporting  to  follow  the
    formula  identified  in  the  Rules  he  identified  the  required  sum
    variously as �16,000 or �16,600 when he should have come  up  with  the
    sum of �19,240.

 5. These errors according to Ms Reid for the claimants are  not  material.
    Firstly the simple fact is that the evidence supports  the  finding  of
    �19,240 being available, and although the judge inserted the wrong  sum
    into his calculations inserting the correct sum would  have  still  led
    him to allow the appeal.

 6. The second point is a little more subtle but the fact is that the judge
    addressed the correct Rule, made it plain that he appreciated the  need
    for the money to be available six months before the  date  of  decision
    and the evidence shows that the money was available six  months  before
    the date of decision but the judge appears to have slightly lost  sight
    of that and so misdirected himself in the determination.  The  fact  is
    he had satisfactory evidence before him, he identified the correct test
    and got to the right answer.

 7. Ms Reid had made these  points  in  a  succinct  and  helpful  skeleton
    argument which had been disclosed properly to  Ms  Everett  before  the
    hearing although, vexingly, had not come to my attention.

 8. In the event this did not matter because it had come  to  Ms  Everett's
    attention. She considered it carefully and she saw the  merits  of  the
    position and although not in a position  to  withdraw  or  concede  the
    appeal could go no further than relying on the grounds which are justly
    criticised in the skeleton argument.

 9. For these reasons I dismiss the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal.   The
    errors are immaterial to the decision made,  so  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
