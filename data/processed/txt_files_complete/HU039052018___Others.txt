Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms Loughran of Loughran & Co. Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are  siblings,  nationals  of  Eritrea.   They  are  the
    brothers and sister of an Eritrean national who fled  from  Eritrea  in
    2014, claimed asylum on arrival in the United Kingdom and  was  granted
    leave to remain as a refugee for five years from 21 October  2015.   We
    shall call him  "the  sponsor".    The  appellants  applied  for  entry
    clearance for family union of a refugee's family under  paragraph  352D
    of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395 (as  amended).
     The basis for the application was that the appellants  claimed  to  be
    the adopted children of  the  sponsor.   The  application  was  refused
    because the respondent did not accept that they  were  related  to  the
    sponsor as claimed, nor that they formed part of his family  unit  when
    he fled to seek asylum.  The respondent  initially  doubted  that  they
    were the sponsor's siblings; but that doubt has been  resolved  by  DNA
    evidence.  The appellants appealed against the refusal.  The appeal was
    heard by Judge Doyle in the First-tier  Tribunal  and  dismissed.   The
    appellants now appeal, with permission, to this Tribunal.

 2. Judge Doyle considered the appellants' appeal on three separate  bases.
    First, he considered the application as actually made, that is  to  say
    by reference to paragraph to 352D.  Secondly, because he was  asked  to
    do so, he considered the matter under  paragraph  319X  of  the  Rules.
    Finally, he  considered  whether  the  appellants  should  be  admitted
    without establishing any entitlement under the Rules.

 3. As we have said, the application, under paragraph 352D, was based on  a
    claim that the appellants had  been  adopted  by  the  sponsor.   After
    considering the oral and documentary evidence, the judge  rejected  the
    claim that the sponsor is  the  appellants'  adoptive  father.   As  Ms
    Loughran confirmed before us, the appellants do not seek  to  challenge
    that decision.  It follows that the relationship between the appellants
    and the sponsor is that of siblings.  It follows that the refusal under
    paragraph 352D was correct.  We need say no more about it.

 4. Paragraph 319X is as follows:

         "Requirements for leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as
         the child of a relative with limited leave to enter or remain in
         the United Kingdom as a refugee or beneficiary of humanitarian
         protection.


         319X. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter
         or remain in the United Kingdom as the child of a relative with
         limited leave to remain as a refugee or beneficiary of humanitarian
         protection in the United Kingdom are that:


         (i)  the applicant is seeking leave to enter or remain to join a
         relative with limited leave to enter or remain as a refugee or
         person with humanitarian protection; and


         (ii) the relative has limited leave in the United Kingdom as a
         refugee or beneficiary of humanitarian protection and there are
         serious and compelling family or other considerations which make
         exclusion of the child undesirable and suitable arrangements have
         been made for the child's care; and


         (iii)    the relative is not the parent of the child who is seeking
         leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom; and


         (iv) the applicant is under the age of 18; and


         (v)  the applicant is not leading an independent life, is unmarried
         and is not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent
         family unit; and


         (vi) the applicant can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the
         relative the child is seeking to join without recourse to public
         funds in accommodation which the relative in the United Kingdom
         owns or occupies exclusively; and


         (vii)    the applicant can, and will, be maintained adequately by
         the relative in the United Kingdom without recourse to public
         funds; and


         (viii)   if seeking leave to enter, the applicant holds a valid
         United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this capacity or, if
         seeking leave to remain, holds valid leave to remain in this or
         another capacity."


 5. On the basis of the  evidence  before  him,  the  judge  said  this  in
    relation to that paragraph:

         "11. ...

         (k)  There is a dearth of reliable evidence about  an  adequacy  of
         maintenance and accommodation without  recourse  to  public  funds.
         The sponsor's oral evidence is that he earns ï¿½500  per  week  as  a
         delivery  driver.   I  have  no   reliable   evidence   about   his
         accommodation costs.  His own evidence is that he lives in  a  two-
         bedroom  property.    That   property   cannot   offer   sufficient
         accommodation for four siblings.   There is no reliable evidence of
         compelling compassionate circumstances which makes the  appellants'
         exclusion undesirable.  The appellants cannot meet the requirements
         of 319X (vi) and (vii).

         (l)  I have no doubt  that  the  sponsor  and  the  appellants  are
         siblings.  I have no doubt that the sponsor is concerned about  his
         siblings and wants to live with them in the UK.  I  have  no  doubt
         that the sponsor sends money  to  support  his  siblings  in  Addis
         Ababa.  Despite that certainty,  the  appellants  cannot  meet  the
         requirements of the immigration rules."

 6. The judge's consideration of article 8  outside  the  Rules  took  into
    account s 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  He
    noted that the lack of evidence that the appellants could speak English
    or had sufficient financial resources for their maintenance would count
    against them.  He then said this:

         "17. If article 8 family life does exist between  the  appellant[s]
         and   the   sponsor,   the   respondent's   decision   is   not   a
         disproportionate breach of the right to  respect  for  family  life
         because it has been  exercised  at  a  distance  since  2014.   The
         respondent's decision preserves the manner in which family life has
         been exercised.

         ...

         19.  Section 117B of the 2002 Act tells me that immigration control
         is in the public interest.  There is insufficient reliable evidence
         before me of factors weighing against the public interest.  Insofar
         as there may be article 8 family life between the sponsor  and  the
         appellants, I must give greater weight to the  public  interest  in
         immigration control.  Having done so, I find that the  decision  is
         not a disproportionate breach of the right to  respect  for  family
         life."

 7. The grounds of appeal raise the following issues.    First,  since  the
    sponsor's parting from the appellants resulted from his  fleeing  as  a
    refugee, the period of  separation  ought  not  to  count  against  the
    appellants' ability to establish a  right  to  family  life  with  him.
    Secondly, the judge erred in law by failing to give  proper  notice  to
    the appellants of whether he had decided that (article 8  family  life)
    existed between the sponsor and the appellants.  Thirdly, if the  judge
    found that there was no article 8 relationship between  the  appellants
    and the sponsor, he erred because he should have concluded that such  a
    right rose from the general circumstances in  Eritrea  and  the  family
    circumstances  of  the  appellants,  neither  of  their  parents  being
    available to care for them.   Fourthly,  the  judge  was  in  error  in
    considering that the appellants' ability to speak English was relevant,
    because their application had been made  under  paragraph  352D,  which
    contains  no  such  requirement.   Fifthly,  the  judge  erred  in  his
    interpretation of the evidence relating to the appellants' mother:  the
    evidence was that she was "detained and released many  times  over  her
    life" and that the appellants lost contact with  her  completely  after
    her arrest in 2014; but the judge said that the appellants  lived  with
    the sponsor and their mother  until  2014.   This  ground  is  avowedly
    connected to the judge's finding on the  claim  that  the  sponsor  had
    adopted the appellants, which, as we have said, Ms  Loughran  confirmed
    was not challenged before us.  Further, Ms Loughran withdrew  ground  4
    before us: it is  obviously  without  merit,  because  the  appellants'
    ability to speak English is  relevant  to  the  matter  the  judge  was
    considering at the  time  he  made  that  observation,  which  was  the
    applicability of the factors in section 117B.

 8. It is inherent in the arrangement of Ms Loughran's grounds and her oral
    submissions that her position is that, the appellants having failed  in
    their claim under paragraph 352D, the next stage in  the  consideration
    of their case should be investigation of whether it would be  right  to
    allow them entry clearance outside the Rules.  That, however,  is  not,
    and cannot be, correct.  Every investigation of a claim under article 8
    demands  a  consideration  of  proportionality,   and   proportionality
    involves the balancing of the public interest against the claims of the
    individual.  Any decision-maker, judicial  or  not,  needs,  for  these
    purposes, some concept of the public interest as it applies to cases of
    these sort in questions.  The Immigration Rules, as they  stand  today,
    are calculated to show how the balance between the public interest  and
    the case of an individual are  to  be  struck  in  a  wide  variety  of
    situations.

 9. In the present case, as the judge  noted,  given  that  the  appellants
    cannot show that they are the sponsor's adopted children, their  claim,
    if any, falls  within  paragraph  319X.   That  paragraph  is  designed
    precisely for children who seek to enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  the
    family member of the person other than a parent, who has  been  granted
    limited leave as a refugee.  The paragraph requires that the applicants
    demonstrate that there are  serious  and  compelling  family  or  other
    considerations which make their exclusion undesirable and that suitable
    arrangements had been made for  their  care;  and  that  they  will  be
    accommodated and  maintained  adequately  without  recourse  to  public
    funds.   It is the provisions of that paragraph that  need  to  be  the
    central consideration in determining whether individuals  such  as  the
    appellants can establish a  right  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  for
    settlement.  It is quite  wrong  to  treat  the  failure  to  meet  the
    requirements of another paragraph as an opportunity for  bypassing  the
    requirements of the Rules that are directly relevant to the facts.

10. As the judge pointed out, no evidence has been adduced on a  number  of
    the factors covered by paragraph 319X.  We should make it clear that we
    do not necessarily agree with all the conclusions that he reached about
    that paragraph; we say this despite the fact that Ms Loughran  did  not
    actually seek to challenge them.  It may well be that there are serious
    and  compelling  reasons  making  the  exclusion  of   the   appellants
    undesirable: that, at least, appeared to be the tenor of Ms  Loughran's
    submissions, albeit directed to  a  more  inchoate  claim  outside  the
    Rules.  It may be that arrangements have been made for the  appellants'
    care in the United Kingdom: there is no evidence about that.  It may be
    that the sponsor's two-bedroomed accommodation would be  sufficient  to
    accommodate the appellants with him without statutory overcrowding:  we
    would not draw the contrary conclusion as swiftly  as  the  judge  did.
    But, as the judge indicated,  the  evidence  going  to  maintenance  is
    obviously wholly insufficient.

11. It is only once the appellants' ability to comply with  paragraph  319X
    has been assessed that the possibility of admission outside  the  Rules
    can be considered.  There are two reasons for that.  The first is  that
    it may be that they can meet the requirements  of  paragraph  319X,  in
    which case admission outside the Rules will not be  in  question.   The
    other reason is that the question of admission outside the Rules cannot
    be considered at all until it is shown that the appellants cannot  meet
    the requirements of any of the Rules, not merely one paragraph  of  the
    Rules which they happened, inappropriately as it  turns  out,  to  have
    selected.  If the appellants cannot meet the requirements of  paragraph
    319X, the consideration of their case will have  to  be  based  on  the
    extent to which it is disproportionate to refuse them admission in  the
    circumstances that are highlighted by paragraph 319X's analysis of  the
    balance normally to be struck in such cases.  For example, the question
    may arise whether it would be right to admit them in  circumstances  in
    which they will not be adequately maintained, or  in  circumstances  in
    which no adequate arrangements have been made  for  their  care.   This
    proportionality assessment cannot  be  undertaken  in  the  absence  of
    detailed evidence provided by the appellants.

12. For these reasons it appears to us that Ms Loughran's grounds of appeal
    simply fail to bite.  They are grounds based on the third stage of  the
    judge's consideration of the appellants' case: but the third stage  was
    not an issue because the appellants have failed to present  their  case
    as the Rules require.  Only when there has been a proper examination of
    a claim within the Rules does the claim outside the Rules  fall  to  be
    considered.  And, for the avoidance of doubt, we do not  regard  it  as
    remotely arguable that it is disproportionate to require the  claimants
    to base an article 8 claim on the provisions of the Rules  that  appear
    to be appropriate to them.

13. We should emphasise that we are very far from lacking in  sympathy  for
    these appellants.  Sympathy  cannot,  however,  be  an  alternative  to
    applying the law to a case such as this.  The appellants are still  all
    under  18,  and  there  is  ample  opportunity  for  them  to  make  an
    application  under  paragraph  319X  (that  now  being  the   obviously
    appropriate route), in which they will be able to show whether they can
    meet the requirements of that paragraph  or,  if  not,  precisely  what
    their circumstances would be  if  they  were  admitted  to  the  United
    Kingdom.  That assessment, whether in the end made  within  or  outside
    the Immigration Rules, is capable of  being  a  rational  and  properly
    structured determination of the  proportionality  of  their  admission,
    which the present appeal is not.

14. For the foregoing reasons we find no error in the First-tier Tribunal's
    decision on this case, and this appeal is therefore dismissed.
