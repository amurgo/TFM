Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Garrod, counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the appellant against a  decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge CAS O'Garro) dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision dated 15 October 2014 refusing him further  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).

Background

2.   The background to  this  appeal  can  be  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 9 January 1986. On  3  March
    2010 he was granted leave to enter the UK as a Tier 4 student until  30
    April 2011. He was then granted further leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4
    student until 18 November 2012 and on 20 August 2012 further leave as a
    Tier 1 (Post-study) migrant until 20 August 2014 when  he  applied  for
    further leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).

3.   His application was refused on 15 October 2014. The respondent was  not
    satisfied that he could meet the requirements of Appendix A: Attributes
    relating to access to funds. He had stated that he  had  access  to  at
    least �50,000 held in the name of his business to  invest  in  the  UK.
    However, it was the respondent's view that  the  evidence  supplied  (a
    Barclays bank statement in the name of the business, a director's  loan
    agreement and a third-party declaration from his team member)  did  not
    meet the criteria  specified  under  Appendix  A  because  he  had  not
    provided any accounts as evidence of investment and  had  not  provided
    suitable third party declarations as evidence that he had access to his
    team member's funds. The decision then says:

          "The Secretary of State is  not  satisfied,  therefore,  that  you
          qualify for  the  award  of  points  in  this  area.    Acceptable
          evidence as defined in paragraph [s] 41-SD [and 46-SD] of Appendix
          A of the Immigration Rules must be provided in order  for  you  to
          meet the criteria and be awarded points.


          As a result of the above, you have not demonstrated that you  meet
          the requirements of the rules to be awarded points under provision
          (d) in the first row of Table 4 of Appendix A."

The Findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge

4.   The appellant appealed against this decision. At the hearing the  judge
    recorded that she had extracted the relevant parts of appendix A of the
    amended Immigration Rules for the period 1 August 2014  to  20  October
    2014 which are set out at [16] of her determination. The appellant  did
    not give oral evidence but relied on a statement filed  in  respect  of
    the appeal saying that he had joined up with Mr Bilal  Ahmed  and  they
    had agreed to set up a new business together.  They  were  entrepreneur
    team members and on 21 November 2013 he and  Mr  Ahmed  had  registered
    their company,  Impetus  Business  Services  Limited.  They  were  both
    directors of the company. The appellant had  invested  �26,500  towards
    the business and Mr Ahmed �25,000. This sum of money had been deposited
    into the business account as a director's loan.

5.   The judge commented that the Tier 1  Entrepreneur  guidance  applicable
    when the appellant made his application stated that from 11 July  2014,
    an applicant who applied for leave  to  remain  and  has  or  was  last
    granted leave to enter or remain as a Tier 1 (Post-study work)  migrant
    would only be awarded points under the provisions in   (b)(ii)  or  (b)
    (iii) in Table 4 of Appendix A, unless they could take advantage of the
    transitional arrangements under the conditions of provision  (d)  [22].
    Under those arrangements, an applicant must have previously held  leave
    as a Tier 1 (Post-study work) migrant since and before 11 July 2014 and
    up to the date of his application, had  been  continuously  engaged  in
    business activity as a registered self-employed or  director  and  have
    already invested �50,000 in the  UK  business.  As  the  appellant  had
    applied under the transitional arrangements that must mean that he  has
    already invested in a business, which has been active  before  11  July
    2014 [23]. He had submitted documents, which showed  that  he  was  the
    director of a company registered on 21 November 2013 but he was  unable
    to demonstrate the investment he made into that company before 11  July
    2014 to enable him to get the points he required [29].

6.   The judge went on to find that the provisions of  para  245AA  did  not
    assist  the  appellant  and  that   the   respondent's   decision   was
    proportionate to a legitimate aim within article 8 (2). The appeal  was
    accordingly dismissed.

The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

7.   In the grounds of appeal it is argued that the application should  have
    been assessed only under the provisions of para 41-SD which applied  to
    those who had access to the required sum whereas para 46-SD applied  to
    applicants who had invested either fully or in part that required  sum.
    In his application form the appellant had ticked  the  box  which  said
    that none of the funds were invested.  It  had  been  argued  that  the
    respondent had erroneously applied the requirements in para  46-SD  and
    that this issue had not been  considered  in  the  decision.   Had  the
    respondent applied para 41-SD, the application would have been allowed.

8.   Permission to  appeal  was  refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
    allowed by the Upper Tribunal on the basis that it  was  arguable  that
    the judge had conflated access to  and  investment  in  not  less  than
    �50,000 and the respective requirements.  UTJ McWilliam added  that  it
    was expected that both parties attend a hearing  with  a  copy  of  the
    relevant rules or guidance and any relevant transitional provisions.

9.   At a hearing before me Mr  Garrod  produced  the  Tier  1  Entrepreneur
    Policy Guidance to be used for applications made on or after  1  August
    2014. He submitted that there was no  requirement  for  �50,000  to  be
    invested and that the judge had erred by finding that there was such an
    additional requirement. The documents submitted by  the  appellant  had
    met the requirements of the rules and, so he  argued,  the  application
    and appeal should have been allowed.

10.  Mr Avery accepted that he could not explain how para  46-SD  came  into
    play in relation to the appellant's application. On a plain reading  of
    the rules it was his view the judge was probably wrong in her  approach
    and that it was not immediately clear why evidence of investment should
    be required.

Assessment of Whether there is an Error of Law

11.  The issue for me at this stage of the  hearing  is  whether  the  judge
    erred in law such that her decision should be set aside.  In  substance
    the outcome of the appellant's appeal depends on whether in addition to
    showing that he had access to  �50,000,  he  was  required  to  provide
    evidence in respect of an investment of  �50,000  in  relation  to  his
    previous leave as  a  Tier  1  (Post-study  work)  migrant.  The  judge
    referred to transitional arrangements  but  neither  Mr  Avery  nor  Mr
    Garrod was able to provide any further information about them  save  in
    so far as appeared from the Policy Guidance produced.

12.  There clearly were transitional arrangements as they  are  referred  to
    in the appellant's application form. These appear at  section  3A.   So
    far as Tier 1 (Post-study work) migrants are  concerned,  if  they  are
    applying to switch to the entrepreneur route after 11  July  2014  they
    are required to have �50,000 from a listed seed funding competition  or
    one or more UK/devolved government departments unless there are able to
    meet the transitional arrangements in the 11 July 2014 section  of  the
    Policy Guidance. On the application form this is set out as follows:

         "Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Transitional  arrangement-11  July  2014-
    access to not less than �50,000 and previously held leave as a  Tier  1
    (Post-Study Work) migrant, and since before 11 July 2014 and after  the
    date of your application you have been continuously engaged in business
    activity,  either  as  registered  self-employed  or  director,  in  an
    occupation at degree level (group d)."

13.  This is the box ticked by the appellant. In response  to  the  question
    at G5, "Have you already invested all or part of  the  funds  in  a  UK
    business that you have joined or started,  within  the  12  months  ...
    before the date of this application?", the appellant  ticked  the  box,
    "No, none of the funds". It is  argued  with  some  force  that  if  an
    applicant seeking to switch  from  Tier  1  Post-study  migrant  to  an
    entrepreneur was required to show an investment,  this  question  would
    never be applicable.

14.  The additional  arrangements  relating  to  Tier  1  (Post-study  work)
    migrants are set out at paragraphs 23 and 58 of  the  Policy  Guidance.
    This reflects the summary given on the  application  form  that  if  an
    application is made by someone in the UK with permission to stay  as  a
    Tier 1 Post-study work migrant after 11 July 2014, they are allowed  to
    make the initial application in the UK only if they have specific types
    of funding or if they qualify under the transitional arrangement  where
    the requirement is for access to �50,000 or more  from  another  source
    (i.e.  not  from  UK  entrepreneurial  seed  funding  competitions   or
    UK/devolved government departments) including their own funds or  money
    from third parties, which may include venture capital  firms  regulated
    by the FCA and continuous engagement in business in the UK since before
    11 July 2014:  paragraph  23.  The  position  is  set  out  further  in
    paragraphs 58 and 59 where it is again made clear that  an  application
    must relate to the specific types of funding unless  an  applicant  can
    show that he has been engaged in business activity since before 11 July
    2014 at the specified level. If these conditions are met the  applicant
    must have at least �50,000 to invest in UK business.

15.  In the light of the documents produced before me I  am  satisfied  that
    the judge erred in law by  requiring  investment  in  addition  to  the
    requirement of having access to not less than �50,000. As the error  is
    clearly material to the outcome of the  appeal,  the  decision  is  set
    aside.



Re-making  the Decision

16.  The proper course is for me to re-make the  decision.  As  is  apparent
    from the consideration of whether the judge  erred  in  law,  the  sole
    issue  in  this  appeal  was  whether  in  addition  to   meeting   the
    requirements set out in Table 4 of the Rules, the appellant had to show
    that he had previously invested �50,000 in a business. For the  reasons
    I have given I am not satisfied that this  was  a  requirement  of  the
    transitional arrangements. I am satisfied that the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of the Rules and that the evidence  he  produced  met  the
    requirements of the specified evidence to be produced in support of the
    application.

Decision

17.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and the decision is set  aside.  I
    allow the appellant's appeal against the decision refusing him  further
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).
