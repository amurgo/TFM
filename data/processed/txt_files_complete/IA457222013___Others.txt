Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr P Hayward, Counsel instructed by Dent Abrams
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Brockleby-Weller, Senior Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.   The Appellants, nationals of India, respective dates  of  birth  3  May
    1957, 20 July 1962 and 24 December 1990 appealed against decisions made
    by the Secretary of State to make removal directions, dated 24  October
    2013.

2.   Their appeals came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Pears  (the  Judge)
    who, on 5 December 2014, dismissed  their  appeals  under  the  Refugee
    Convention and on human rights grounds on the basis of Articles 3 and 8
    of the European Convention on Human Rights.

3.   Permission to appeal the judge's  decisions  was  given  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Pooler on 30 January 2015.

4.   The grounds seeking permission were  settled  by  Mr  Hayward  who  had
    appeared before the judge.

5.   It is fair to say that the judge's approach  to  the  evidence  in  one
    sense appears to be requiring a higher standard of proof than might  be
    expected, bearing in mind the lower standard of  reasonable  likelihood
    or real risk which has to be established.  Whilst the judge recited the
    threshold of evidence required, it appeared to me on a reading  of  the
    decision that the judge was actually expecting a good  deal  more  than
    met that standard.

6.   Of particular concern to me in reading the decision were the  following
    matters.  First, that the judge had rejected a report from an advocate,
    Mr M K Chouhan, who is an advocate of the  High  Court  of  Punjab  and
    Haryana as well as an approved  advocate  in  the  District  Courts  of
    Haryana, a Member of the Bar of Punjab and Haryana Chandigah, holding a
    degree in  law  and  being  an  experienced  practitioner  continuously
    practising in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana as well the District
    Courts to which I have referred, with some 31 years of practice in  law
    and familiar with both criminal and civil law as applicable  in  India.
    His opinion set out a fair and balanced approach to the  issues  raised
    and,  amongst  other  things,  identified  by  reference  to   specific
    legislative provisions that the matters which were contained within  an
    FIR lodged against  the  first  Appellant  implicated  him  in  serious
    criminality: Being offences which do not attract the immediate  release
    on bail and which, as he acknowledged, there was no chance of bail  for
    "quite a long time".  He was not, as the  judge  characterised,  simply
    saying bail cannot be obtained but he was in fact accepting it  may  be
    but after a significant period of delay.  His remarks  generally  about
    health provision in Indian prisons and  steps  being  taken  to  quash,
    false allegations raised, appeared to me to be perfectly  sensible  and
    do not disclose bias or prejudice or an unbalanced opinion in  relation
    to the first Appellant.

7.   In the circumstances, at paragraph 73 of the decision by the  judge,  I
    do not find it is adequate reasoning to say in  regards  to  the  first
    Appellant's and his legal position:

         "I have no confidence that the  'legal  opinion'  is  an  impartial
         objective account of the legal position in India and that  the  FIR
         could not be quashed or bail granted.  However if I were to  accept
         it as being accurate it may take about a year for a decision on the
         case on merits." (sic).

    This really does  not  get  to  grips  with  the  significance  of  the
    background material which had been provided which shows what some might
    categorise  as  appalling,  the  woefully  inadequate   provision   for
    detainees both in pre-trial detention and during  trial.   To  blithely
    assert that the Appellant could in due course be released after a  year
    from such detention really does not meet with the Article 3  issue  and
    appeared also to me to be requiring a greater weight of  evidence  than
    necessary to discharge the burden of proof of real risk.

8.   The judge also simply failed to properly address the evidence that  was
    before him concerning the deficiencies  identified  in  the  background
    evidence provided both in terms of conditions in detention,  conditions
    of gross overcrowding  of  people  awaiting  trial  and  the  pre-trial
    detention  being  arbitrary  and  lengthy:   Sometimes  exceeding   the
    sentence given to those convicted: I  bear  in  mind  the  dispute  was
    claimed to be a civil matter in relation  to  a  death  but  which  has
    manifested itself  as,  in  effect,  obtaining  property  or  money  by
    deception.  For that reason alone, I am left with considerable concerns
    that the judge's failure was a material error of  law  certainly  which
    stands, come what may, in relation to the first Appellant.

9.   However the position is to a  degree  the  worst  in  relation  to  the
    second and third Appellants being respectively  the  first  Appellant's
    wife and son.  The  judge  had  accepted  that  the  first  Appellant's
    daughter Arshya and her fianc� had returned to India where she had been
    picked up, her passport taken and she was detained as  a  result  of  a
    'noting' entry in immigration controls at Indian  airports.   This  had
    led to a period of her detention for ten days before  ultimately  being
    cleared of any relationship to, or involvement in the alleged  offences
    committed by the first Appellant.

10.  The judge found both Arshya and her fianc�,  Mr  Ricardo  Soff,  to  be
    open and truthful.  He concluded that there was nothing to suggest they
    were not telling the truth.  He additionally heard about a  brother-in-
    law  of  the  first  Appellant  who  had  himself  been  detained,  but
    ultimately cleared of any involvement, and who was  not  named  in  the
    relevant FIR against the first Appellant.  It is plain  that  he  could
    have no doubt that the FIR had been laid it was a legal document,  even
    if its contents were false, and given the position there was nothing to
    suggest that equally on a 'noting' entry basis, either  the  second  or
    third Appellants might not similarly be arrested.  It was noteworthy in
    relation to Arshya that she had to pay bribes  to  the  police  not  to
    inform the complainant, against the first Appellant, of her presence in
    the country, let alone  to  smooth  her  way  through  the  process  of
    detention.  It does not seem to me the correct approach was to  dismiss
    those possibilities simply on the  basis  that  they  can  be  resolved
    through legitimate legal means, that  is  due  process,  or  by  paying
    bribes:  I conclude there has been a material  error  of  law  in  that
    respect.

11.  The further issue was taken over the question of the first  Appellant's
    mental health.  It seemed to me on the face of it that as an issue  was
    never sufficiently significant to engage Article 3 ECHR in its own  way
    but it was pertinent to how he would cope were he to be detained or  to
    manage his personal circumstances.  Again the judge's view in  relation
    to the significance of those matters seemed to me to have  been  driven
    by the view he took of the  adverse  conclusions  upon  the  first  and
    second Appellant.  I note, at paragraph 67 of the decision, points that
    the judge took as to he adequacy of the evidence and in  many  respects
    those could have been freestanding and would not have been a  basis  on
    which I would have interfered or found any error of law in the  judge's
    decision.  However, it is the approach to both the  standard  of  proof
    and to the evidence which supported the existence of the  FIR  and  its
    abuse, as it is said by the Appellants, that the judge did  accept  and
    in that context it is hard to exclude risk  to  the  first  and  second
    Appellants.  Given what he has accepted in relation to the existence of
    the FIR and, although he makes  no  particular  reference  to  it,  the
    significance  of  detention  on  return  and  ill-treatment  whilst  in
    detention.

12.  All the findings of fact  need  not  be  re-examined,  particularly  in
    relation to aspects of the decision which the judge  properly  reasoned
    but it seems to me the parties should, if they wish to preserve any  of
    the findings of fact provide a list to the First-tier  Tribunal  so  it
    may decide whether or not for the proper disposal of the appeal on  re-
    making it, those or any of those findings of fact should stand.

NOTICE OF DECISION

13.  For these reasons I find that the decision  of  the  Original  Tribunal
    cannot stand and it will have to be re-made.

DIRECTIONS:

    1.   It will be re-made in the First-tier Tribunal (IAC).

    2.   Time estimate 2 hours.

    3.   No interpreter required.

    4.   Any further documents relied upon for the  purposes  of  re-making
         the Articles 3 and 8 ECHR claim to be submitted not later than  ten
         clear days before the further re-making of the decision  or  unless
         the Tribunal otherwise orders.

    5.   Not to be listed before First-tier Tribunal Judge Pears or  First-
         tier Tribunal Judge Pooler.

14.  An anonymity order is not necessary.
