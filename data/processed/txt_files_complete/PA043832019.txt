                         (Anonymity direction made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


    I make an anonymity direction under rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) in the  light  of
    the matters raised in this appeal.  This order prohibits the disclosure
    directly or indirectly (including by the parties) of  the  identity  of
    the appellant.  Any disclosure in breach of this order may amount to  a
    contempt of court.  This order shall remain in force unless revoked  or
    varied by the Upper Tribunal or an appropriate Court.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant claims to be a citizen of Turkey and to be an Alevi Kurd.



 2. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on  27  December  2018  and
    claimed asylum the next day.  He claimed he had been detained and  ill-
    treated by the Turkish authorities and to  be  at  risk  from  them  on
    return to Turkey.

 3. On 24 April 2019, the  Secretary  of  State  rejected  his  claims  for
    asylum, humanitarian protection and on human  rights  grounds.   Whilst
    the Secretary of State accepted the  appellant  was  from  Turkey,  she
    otherwise rejected his claim including that he was an Alevi Kurd.

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  Judge CJ Cowx found
    the appellant's account implausible and dismissed  his  appeal  on  all
    grounds.

 5. The appellant sought, and was granted,  permission  to  appeal  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Keane) on 3 February 2020.

 6.  On 6 April 2020, the Upper Tribunal issued directions (dated 23  March
    2020) in the light of the Covid-9 pandemic, inter alia, indicating that
    it was provisionally of the view that the error of law issue  could  be
    determined without a hearing and inviting submissions on that issue and
    also the error of law of issue.

 7. On 16 April 2020, the Secretary of State responded accepting  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision was inadequately reasoned  and  inviting
    the Upper Tribunal to set aside the decision and remit  the  appeal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo re-hearing.

 8. On 23 April 2020,  the  appellant's  representative  responded  to  the
    submissions, not surprisingly having seen  the  respondent's  response,
    agreeing there was a material error of law and  that  the  First-tier's
    decision should be set aside and remitted for a de novo re-hearing  all
    issues.  However, the representative invited the  UT  to  preserve  one
    finding said to be made by the judge  at  para  7.7,  namely  that  the
    appellant is Kurdish.   The respondent does  not  accept  that  can  be
    preserved.

 9. Neither party objected to the UT deciding the error of  law  without  a
    hearing and accordingly, exercising my discretion,  I  do  so  applying
    rule 34 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (SI
    2008/2698 as amended).

10. It is conceded that the First-tier Tribunal's decision to  dismiss  the
    appeal involved the making of a material error of law.   I  agree  with
    that concession for  the  reasons  set  out  in  the  Grounds  and  the
    respondent's submissions.

11. It is also accepted, and I agree, that the decision should be set aside
    and the appeal remitted to the FtT in order to remake the decision.   I
    do not accept, however, that  any  findings  of  the  judge  should  be
    preserved.  On remittal, a new judge will have to  make  a  credibility
    finding  on  all  aspects  of  the  appellant's  claim,  including  his
    ethnicity.  It would be wrong to preserve a single  finding  which,  as
    with all  future  findings,  must  necessarily  be  bound  up  in  that
    assessment.  But, in any event, it is far from  clear  that  the  judge
    made a finding in the appellant's favour at para 7.7  where  he  simply
    said "he may well be Kurdish as he claims" and that he was prepared  to
    "give him the benefit of the doubt on this point".  The  proper  course
    is, in my view, that the First-tier Tribunal on  remittal  should  make
    its decision on the appeal de novo without any preserved findings.

    Decision

12. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal involved the making of an error of law.  I set it aside.

13. The appeal is remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Glasgow  Hearing
    Centre) to be heard de novo (without any preserved facts)  by  a  Judge
    other than Judge Cowx.

                                                                      Signed

                                                                Andrew Grubb

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal

                                                                 13 May 2020
