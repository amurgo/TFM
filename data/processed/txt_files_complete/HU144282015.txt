For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge C Ferguson, promulgated on 23rd May 2017, following a hearing  at
    Taylor House on  10th  May  2017.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal of Mr Sarman Rama Odedara, whereupon the appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of India, and was  born  2nd  August
    1983.  He  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  Entry
    Clearance Officer dated 26th November 2015,  refusing  his  application
    for entry clearance to join his spouse, Ms Soniya  Gogan  Sundavada,  a
    British citizen present and settled in the UK.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he and the Sponsor have known each  other
    since 2005, and they married each other on 30th January 2012, making an
    application for entry clearance on 29th September 2015.  Although  they
    had seen each other since March 2012, they remained in contact  through
    phone  calls,  photographs,  and  Virgin  media  telephone  bills  were
    submitted, to this effect.  The Appellant's  sponsoring  wife  had  not
    been able to travel to India  since  their  marriage  because  she  was
    struggling to find employment,  and  she  had  to  meet  the  financial
    requirement of being able to show �18,600 income per annum.  There was,
    however, enough evidence submitted of their contact, according  to  the
    appellant and his sponsoring wife.

The Judge's Determination

 4. The judge had regard to the  leading  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  first  in
    Goudey [2012] UKUT 41,  and  Naz  [2012]  UKUT  40  in  coming  to  his
    decision.  He observed that although there was  post-decision  evidence
    of regular contact between the parties, he had to bear  in  mind  that,
    "By that stage the Appellant and the Sponsor  knew  that  the  lack  of
    contact was no reason for refusing entry clearance so they had a strong
    incentive to  provide  evidence  of  contact  to  support  the  appeal"
    (paragraph 28).  Nevertheless, the  judge  went  on  to  make  a  clear
    finding that, "Much of the oral evidence  was  not  challenged  by  the
    Respondent during the hearing ..." (paragraph 29).

 5. Nevertheless, the judge concluded that he could not be  satisfied  that
    the relationship between the parties was genuine and subsisting.   This
    was despite the fact that the judge "did not place much weight  on  the
    fact that the Sponsor did not travel to India  between  2012  and  2016
    because clearly she had very little income and I accept she was focused
    on meeting the financial requirement" (paragraph 29).

 6. Notwithstanding this, however, the judge went on in the next breath  to
    say that, "I note, however, that the Sponsor is unable to  explain  why
    they had not applied for the Appellant to come to the UK as a  visitor"
    (paragraph 29).

 7. Secondly, although there was evidence of 23 phone cards produced by the
    Appellant to demonstrate that they had been in regular contact  through
    making telephone calls with each other, the judge concluded that,  "One
    would expect to see either more calling cards or  further  evidence  of
    calls from the Sponsor's mother's mobile phone" (paragraph 30).

 8. The appeal was dismissed.

The Grant of Permission

 9. On 30th June 2017, permission to appeal was granted by the Tribunal  on
    the basis that, it was not in dispute that the parties had entered into
    a marriage on 30th January 2012, and arguably, as set up in the Grounds
    of Appeal, the judge's approach to the evidence displayed an  erroneous
    approach to the relevant burden and standard of proof.  The  respondent
    argued he failed to identify any matter that would  generate  suspicion
    as to the intention of either party to the marriage,  and  arguably  no
    reason is identified that would allow the judge to reject the  evidence
    before here as untrue.

10. On 13th July 2014 a Rule 24 response was entered to the effect that  it
    was open to the judge to find that the Appellant and  the  Sponsor  are
    not in a genuine and subsisting relationship and have taken a  holistic
    view of the evidence presented at the hearing.

The Hearing

11. At the hearing before me on 8th September 2017, Mr  Collins,  appearing
    on behalf of the Appellant, relied upon his  well  crafted  grounds  of
    application.  He repeated what he had  said  before  the  judge  below,
    namely, that, with respect to why the communication between the parties
    was so limited,  "There  is  no  paramount  model  of  contact  in  the
    relationship" (paragraph 25).  He also stated that, the judge was wrong
    to quibble with the fact  that  only  23  phone  cards  were  produced,
    because in this case if every telephone card  and  telephone  bill  had
    been produced, this would have spanned a period of some five years  and
    that this was "illogical and irrational".

12. In any event, no proper or adequate findings are made with  respect  to
    the telephone cards and other evidence of telephone contact  which  was
    produced before the judge.

13. Moreover, the judge made no findings at all  on  the  evidence  of  the
    witnesses called, because there were three witnesses who gave evidence,
    and the wife's auntie, Devanand Theba, actually attended the wedding in
    2012 and she stated at paragraph 6 of her statement that, "They  are  a
    couple, completely in love and committed to each other".

14. For his part, Mr McVeety, appearing on behalf of the  Respondent  Entry
    Clearance Officer, submitted that he would have to agree that the judge
    had fallen into error in her approach to the evidence before her.

Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.  First, whilst the judge  refers,
    quite properly to the two leading decisions of the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Goudey and in Naz, she fails to adhere to the principles as set out  in
    those cases.

16. Goudey stands for the proposition that there has to  be  evidence  that
    the matrimonial relationship is continuing at the  relevant  time,  but
    this does not mean that there has to be production of particular  types
    of evidence indicative of a mutual devotion between the  parties.   The
    suggestion that 23 phone cards were not enough, and  that  more  should
    have been produced is irrational, in  the  absence  of  any  suspicious
    circumstances pointing to the marriage being one which was contrived in
    order to frustrate the application of the  Immigration  Rules.   It  is
    also irrational because it requires, as Mr Collins submitted, that  the
    parties keep phone cards for the duration of a five year period, during
    which they had not been able to see each other.

17. This was particularly  the  case  given  that  the  judge  had  already
    accepted that the failure of the Sponsor to make another visit to India
    after her marriage was not in itself suspicious because she had to save
    up enough monies in order to be able to meet  the  financial  threshold
    requirement.

18. The decision in Naz  stands  for  the  proposition  that  post-decision
    evidence is admissible to show that the marriage is subsisting.   There
    is nothing in that decision which suggests that parties have  a  higher
    threshold to satisfy, namely, that of explaining why, in  circumstances
    where there would be every incentive in a genuine marriage to  continue
    contact with each other, they have to prove a  negative,  namely,  that
    they are not remaining in contact in order to  simply  bolster  a  weak
    marriage claim.

19. Finally, the suggestion by the judge that, in circumstances where "much
    of the oral evidence was not challenged", the marriage could still  not
    be accepted as being one which was "genuine and subsisting", even where
    the Sponsor could not travel between 2012 and  2016  because  "she  had
    very little income", that she had to, "explain why they had not applied
    for the Appellant to come to the UK as a visitor"  (paragraph  29),  is
    again unwarranted.

20. Not only is there absolutely no requirement in a  marriage  case,  even
    where the parties have been separated from each other for  many  years,
    that an application is made from the country overseas to come to the UK
    as a visitor, but as Mr McVeety agreed with me, when I put this  matter
    for consideration by both sides, an application to enter as a  visitor,
    would in all  probability  be  refused,  because  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer in New Delhi would not,  on  a  balance  of  probabilities,  be
    satisfied that the appellant intended to return back  to  India,  after
    visiting a wife whom he could not otherwise  visit,  because  the  wife
    could not show the requisite �18,600 savings.

21. This is assuming that the sponsoring wife had the funds (which she  had
    been prudently saving up in order to sponsor his  spouse's  application
    to join her on a permanent basis) to support his temporary visit to her
    as a visitor.

22. A prudent wife may well have taken the view that it was not practicable
    to embark on such a course when what she really wanted  to  do  was  to
    save up enough money to sponsor his application to come to the UK on  a
    permanent basis as her husband.

23. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of  the  judge,
    the evidence before her, and the submissions that I have  heard  today.
    I am allowing this appeal for the reasons that I have set out above.

Notice of Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed.

25. No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have decided considered to make a reduced fee award of any fee  which  has
been paid or may be payable.
