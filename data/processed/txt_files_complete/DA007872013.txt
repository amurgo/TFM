Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Duncan of Duncan Moghal Solicitors & Advocates

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order made  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
      Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither party  invited
      me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule 14  of  the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

   2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of  the
      First-tier Tribunal (Judge N J  Osborne  and  Ms  S  E  Singer)  which
      allowed HS's appeal against a decision taken by the Secretary of State
      that s.32(5) of the  UK  Borders  Act  2007  applied  and  to  make  a
      deportation order on 16 April 2013.

   3. For convenience, I will refer to the parties as they  appeared  before
      the First-tier Tribunal.

   4. The appellant is a citizen of Somalia who was born on 28 August  1988.
      He arrived in the UK and claimed asylum on  17  September  2004.   The
      Secretary of State refused the appellant's  claim  for  asylum  on  25
      October 2004 but granted him discretionary leave until his  eighteenth
      birthday on 27 August 2006.  On 21 August 2006 the  appellant  applied
      for further leave to remain.  On 16 July 2010 he  claimed  asylum  and
      was interviewed on 3 August 2010.

   5. Between May 2008 and February 2009 the appellant was convicted of  ten
      offences including possession  of  Class  C  drugs,  having  a  bladed
      article in a public place and using threatening behaviour with  intent
      to cause distress.  On 2 September 2009 the appellant was convicted at
      the Bristol Crown Court of possession of a Class  A  controlled  drug,
      namely heroine with intent to supply and was sentenced to  two  years'
      imprisonment.

   6. The appellant was released on licence in April  2011.   Subsequent  to
      his release, on 6 June 2012 the appellant was convicted of  possession
      of a class B drug (cannabis) and sentenced to 2  months  imprisonment;
      on 23 July 2012 he was convicted of possession of a controlled Class B
      drug, namely cannabis/cannabis resin for which he was fined �110; on 9
      August 2012 he was convicted of failing to surrender to custody at  an
      appointed time and fined �50; on 26 September 2012 he was convicted of
      possession of a Class B controlled drug (cannabis) and fined �50;  and
      finally on 26 November 2012  he  was  convicted  of  possession  of  a
      controlled Class B drug (cannabis) and fined �110.

   7.  The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the
      Secretary of State's  decision  to  apply  the  automatic  deportation
      provisions in the 2007 Act as  a  result  of  his  conviction  at  the
      Bristol Crown Court in 2009 for possession with  intent  to  supply  a
      Class A drug, namely heroine with a term of imprisonment of 2 years.

   8. The First-tier Tribunal (Judge N J Osborne and Ms S E Singer)  allowed
      the  appellant's  appeal.   First,  the  Tribunal  accepted  that  the
      appellant was at risk on return to Somalia  because  of  his  minority
      clan membership.  Secondly, the Tribunal concluded that the  appellant
      had  rebutted  the  presumption  arising  pursuant  to  s.72  of   the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 that as a result  of  his
      conviction for a "particularly serious crime" he constituted "a danger
      to the community".  Thirdly, applying the country guidance case of AMM
      and Others (Conflict; Humanitarian Crises; Returnees; FGM) Somalia  CG
      [2011] UKUT 445  (IAC)  the  Tribunal  concluded  that  on  return  to
      Southern Somalia the appellant would  face  a  risk  of  serious  harm
      arising from indiscriminate violence contrary to Article 15(c) of  the
      Qualification Directive (Council Directive 2004/83/EC).  Finally,  the
      Tribunal concluded  that  the  appellant's  deportation  would  breach
      Article 8 of the ECHR.

   9. The Secretary of State lodged detailed grounds seeking  permission  to
      appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  On 29 July  2013,  The  Upper  Tribunal
      (UTJ Goldstein) granted the Secretary of State permission  to  appeal.
      Thus, the appeal came before me.

  10. In his oral submissions on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr
      Richards declined  to  rely  on  any  of  the  drafted  grounds  which
      challenged the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  to  allow  the  appeal
      under Article 8.  He accepted that the approach of the Tribunal had to
      be seen in the light of the Court of Appeal's recent  decision  in  MF
      (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.  As I understood  Mr  Richards'
      submissions he did not seek to  argue  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      erred in law in approaching Article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules.
      He accepted that the First-tier Tribunal had only taken  into  account
      all relevant matters and had excluded irrelevant matters.  He accepted
      that in respect of Article 8, the First-tier Tribunal had not erred in
      law in allowing the appellant's appeal.

  11. In the light of that concession, I need say no more about the  grounds
      and their  challenge  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  under
      Article 8.  Its decision to allow the appeal under Article 8 stands.

  12. Instead, Mr  Richards  directed  his  submissions  to  the  Tribunal's
      consideration of s.72 of the 2002 Act.  He accepted that the  Tribunal
      had been entitled to find that the appellant was at risk on return  to
      Somalia.  However, he submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had  been
      wrong to find that the presumption that the appellant "constitute[d] a
      danger to the community of the United Kingdom" had been rebutted.   He
      submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  wrongly  downplayed  the
      appellant's post-conviction  offending  -  essentially  consisting  of
      offences of possession of Class B drugs,  namely  cannabis  -  on  the
      basis that that behaviour did not adversely affect any member  of  the
      community.  Mr Richards submitted that there was always potential  for
      harm to the community by those who  were  taking  illegal  drugs.   Mr
      Richards invited me to find that the Tribunal had erred in law and  to
      reverse the decision rejecting the certification  under  s.72  of  the
      2002 Act.

  13. Mr Duncan, on behalf of the appellant, submitted that the Tribunal was
      fully entitled to find that the appellant's post-conviction  offending
      rebutted the presumption that he was a danger to  the  community.   He
      submitted that the Tribunal had assessed the risk to the community and
      any potential risk was merely  hypothetical.   He  submitted  that  Mr
      Richards' position could, in principle, apply to any criminal  offence
      which would give  rise  to  a  hypothetical  risk  of  impact  on  the
      community whether financial or otherwise.  That, Mr Duncan  submitted,
      removed  the  possibility  of  an  individual   ever   rebutting   the
      presumption that he was a "danger to the community" under s.72.

  14. Article 33(1) of the  Refugee  Convention  sets  out  the  prohibition
      against "expulsion or return" ('refoulement')  of  a  refugee.    That
      prohibition on refoulement is removed in the circumstances set out  in
      Article 33(2) which provides a follows:

           "The benefit of the  present  provision  may  not,  however,  be
           claimed by a refugee  whom  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for
           regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he
           is, or who, having been convicted by  a  final  judgement  of  a
           particularly  serious  crime,  constitutes  a  danger   to   the
           community of that country."

  15.  Section  72  of  the  2002  Act  "applies  for  the  purpose  of  the
      construction  and  application  of  Article  33(2)  of   the   Refugee
      Convention".

  16. For present purposes  the  relevant  provision  is  in  s.72(2)  which
      provides:

           A person shall be presumed to have been convicted by a final
           judgement of a particularly serious crime and to constitute a
           danger to the community of the United Kingdom if he is -

           (a) convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and

           (b) sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least two
           years."

  17. Section 72(9) permits the Secretary of State to issue a certificate
      that the presumptions, inter alia, in sub-section 2 apply.

  18. Section 72(10) sets out the procedure before the First-tier Tribunal
      where such a certificate is issued as follows:

           "The Tribunal...hearing the appeal -

        a) must be given substantive deliberation on the appeal by
           considering the certificate; and

        b) if in agreement that presumptions under sub-section (2)...apply
           (having given the appellant an opportunity for rebuttal) must
           dismiss the appeal in so far as it relies on the grounds
           specified in sub-section (9)(a). "


  19. The grounds specified in sub-section (9)(a) is that  the  individual's
      removal would breach the Refugee Convention.

  20. The same procedure applies when  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  remaking  a
      decision  under  s.12(2)(b)(ii)   of   the   Tribunals,   Courts   and
      Enforcement Act 2007 (see, s.72(10A)).

  21. In this appeal, the Secretary of  State  issued  a  certificate  under
      s.72(9)  that  as  a  result  of  the   appellant's   conviction   and
      imprisonment for two years he had been convicted  of  a  "particularly
      serious crime" and was a "danger to the community".

  22. There is no doubt that the appellant was convicted of a  "particularly
      serious crime" and he made no attempt before the  First-tier  Tribunal
      to rebut that presumption.  However,  as  regards  whether  he  was  a
      "danger to the community",  the  appellant  did  seek  to  rebut  that
      presumption on the basis of his post-conviction behaviour.   At  paras
      11 and 12 of its determination, the Tribunal  dealt  with  this  issue
      and, having  set  out  the  appellant's  conviction  after  the  index
      offence, said this at para 12.

           "12.  None of those matters involved a  member  of  the  public.
                 None of those matters are anywhere near as serious  as  the
                 index offence.  None of those  offences  involve  behaviour
                 which has adversely affected any member of the community in
                 any way.  As the Appellant has been living in the community
                 for in excess of two years following his release and as the
                 Respondent has no evidence of the Appellant having  been  a
                 danger to the community in that period, we  find  that  the
                 Appellant has rebutted the presumption that he is a  danger
                 to the community."

  23. It is clear that the two issues of  whether  an  individual  has  been
      convicted of a "particularly serious crime" and is a  "danger  to  the
      community" are  separate  issues  for  determination  (see  IH  (s.72;
      'Particularly Serious Crime') Eritrea [2009]  UKAIT  00012  at  [75]).
      The issue of 'dangerousness'  requires  a  consideration  of  all  the
      circumstances, including the individual's  past  offending  and  post-
      conviction behaviour (see, SB (Cessation and Exclusion)  Haiti  [2005]
      UKIAT 0036 at [68]).

  24. In this case, the Tribunal did consider the appellant's  circumstances
      in the round.  The appellant had been released  on  licence  for  more
      than two years by the date of the First-tier Tribunal's  hearing.  The
      Tribunal took into account the nature of the offences he had committed
      in that  time.   In  determining  whether  the  presumption  that  the
      appellant remained a "danger to the community" on  the  basis  of  his
      conviction for possession with intent to supply  Class  A  drugs,  the
      Tribunal was entitled to take  into  account  that,  although  he  had
      committed a number of offences, these  were  offences  which  did  not
      directly affect any member of the  community.   Mr  Richards  did  not
      suggest otherwise.   The convictions were for possession  of  Class  B
      drugs - and not the more serious offence  possession  with  intent  to
      supply.  That the convictions were  not  for  the  latter  offence  is
      reflected in the sentences, all but one was by way of a fine.   In  my
      judgment, the Tribunal was  entitled  to  take  the  view  that  these
      offences arose out of the appellant's personal  use  of  cannabis  and
      were not linked to any risk of future supply to the general public.  I
      do not accept Mr Richards' submission that,  in  effect,  any  offence
      involving  illegal  drugs  demonstrates  a  potential  harm   to   the
      community.  Such a danger would, obviously, be demonstrated by dealers
      or suppliers in illegal drugs.  The "danger" to the community must  be
      real or tangible.  I accept Mr Duncan's submission  that  hypothetical
      or speculative risk to the public alone will not suffice.  Here, for a
      two year period the appellant's  offending  created  no  risk  to  the
      public.  That is, of course, not to seek to trivialise  his  offending
      after the index offence.  It merely recognises that the requirement of
      a "danger to the community" requires there to be  a  "danger"  to  the
      community demonstrated by "proof of the particular serious offence and
      the risk of its reoccurrence or  of  the  reoccurrence  of  a  similar
      offence or other offence which  will  endanger  the  public  (see,  EN
      (Serbia) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 630 at [46]).

  25. In my judgement, the First-tier Tribunal's  finding  in  paragraph  12
      that the appellant had rebutted the presumption that he is a danger to
      the community was one properly  open  to  it  on  the  evidence.   The
      Tribunal  did  not  misdirect  itself  and  its  finding   cannot   be
      characterised as irrational or perverse.   I  did  not  understand  Mr
      Richards' submissions to entail any other challenge to the  First-tier
      Tribunal's decision that the s.72 presumption was rebutted.

  26. For these reasons, therefore, the First-tier Tribunal did not  err  in
      law in finding that the appellant  had  rebutted  the  presumption  in
      s.72(2) of the 2002 Act so that the prohibition against his removal as
      a refugee in Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention applied.

  27. One final point concerns the First-tier Tribunal finding in para 27 of
      its determination that the appellant's removal  to  Somalia  would  be
      contrary to Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive.

  28. Given that the Tribunal had found that the appellant  qualified  as  a
      refugee (which he did even if he could be returned because of  Article
      33(2) of the Refugee Convention), the appellant was  not  entitled  to
      humanitarian protection under paragraph 339C of the Immigration  Rules
      or  subsidiary  protection  under  Article  15  of  the  Qualification
      Directive.   The   two   forms   of   international   protection   are
      alternatives.

  29. Para 339C(ii) sets out as one  of  the  requirements  to  a  grant  of
      humanitarian protection that the individual

           "does not qualify as a refugee as defined in regulation 2 of the
           Refugee  or  Person  in   Need   of   International   Protection
           (Qualification) Regulations 2006" (emphasis added).

  30. Regulation 2 of the 2006 Regulations states that a "refugee" means

           "a person who falls within Article 1(A) of the Geneva Convention
           and to whom regulation 7 does not apply".

      Regulation 7 excludes from refugee protection  individuals  who  falls
      within Articles 1D, 1E or 1F of the Refugee Convention.

  31. Likewise the Qualification Directive in Article 2(e) defines a "person
      eligible  for  subsidiary  protection"  to  mean  "a   third   country
      national...who does not qualify as a refugee" but, to  summarise,  can
      demonstrate a real risk  of  suffering  serious  harm  as  defined  in
      Article 15 (emphasis added).

  32. In this appeal, the appellant, on the  Tribunal's  (now  unchallenged)
      finding fell within the definition of a refugee in Article 1A  of  the
      Refugee  Convention.   The  appellant  did  "qualify  as  a   refugee"
      (whatever the application of Art 33(2) of the Refugee  Convention  and
      s.72 of the 2002 Act) and thus was  not  entitled,  on  any  view,  to
      humanitarian  protection  under  Article  15(c).   (There  is  also  a
      corresponding exclusion from humanitarian protection of any individual
      who is a "danger to the community" (para 339D(iii) of the Rules).)  It
      may well be that the First-tier Tribunal in finding in the appellant's
      favour under Article 15(c) was engaged in a 'belt and braces' exercise
      as the Tribunal did  not,  in  fact,  formally  allow  the  appeal  on
      humanitarian protection grounds.

Decision

  33. The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

  34. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to  allow  the  appellant's  appeal
      under Article 8 of the ECHR and on  the  basis  that  his  deportation
      would breach the Refugee Convention stand.
