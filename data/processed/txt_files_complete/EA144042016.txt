Representation:
For the appellant:           Mr S. Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the respondent:          No appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    For the sake of continuity, we shall refer  to  the  parties  as  they
    were before the First-tier Tribunal although technically the  Secretary
    of State is the appellant in the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

2.    There was no appearance by  or  on  behalf  of  Mr  Antulis.  We  were
    satisfied that a production order was made for him attend  the  hearing
    from the prison where he was last known to be held on  remand.  On  the
    morning of the hearing, the Upper Tribunal was notified by  the  prison
    authorities that Mr Antulis refused to attend. We were  satisfied  that
    he had notice of the hearing and an opportunity to attend. There was no
    evidence to indicate any other reason as to why he did not  attend.  In
    the circumstances we were satisfied that we could proceed to  determine
    the Secretary of State's appeal in his absence.

The removal decision

3.    In a decision dated 21 December 2016 the Secretary  of  State  decided
    to remove  Mr  Antulis  from  the  United  Kingdom  with  reference  to
    regulations 19(3)(a) and 24(2) of The  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations 2006"). The relevant parts
    of regulation 19 were as follows:

                    19.      .....
                       (3)   Subject  to  paragraph  (4)  and  (5),  an  EEA
                 national who has entered the United Kingdom or  the  family
                 member of such  a  national  who  has  entered  the  United
                 Kingdom may be removed if-
                 a) that person does not have or ceases to have a  right  to
                    reside under these Regulations;
                 b) the Secretary of State has  decided  that  the  person's
                    removal is justified on grounds of public policy, public
                    security or public health in accordance with  regulation
                    21;
                 c) the Secretary of State has  decided  that  the  person's
                    removal is justified on grounds of abuse  of  rights  in
                    accordance with regulation 21B(2).
                       (4)   A person must not be  removed  under  paragraph
                 (3) as the automatic consequence of having recourse to  the
                 social assistance system of the United Kingdom.
                       (5)   A person must not be  removed  under  paragraph
                 (3) if he has a right to remain in the  United  Kingdom  by
                 virtue of leave granted  under  the  1971  Act  unless  his
                 removal is justified  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,
                 public  security  or  public  health  in  accordance   with
                 regulation 21. [emphasis added]

4.    Regulation 24 of the EEA Regulations 2006 stated:

                 24.   .....
                        (2)  Where a decision is taken to  remove  a  person
                 under regulation 19(3)(a)  or  (c)  the  person  is  to  be
                 treated as if he were a person to whom section 10(1)(a)  of
                 the 1999 Act applied, and section 10 of that  Act  (removal
                 of certain persons unlawfully in the United Kingdom) is  to
                 apply accordingly.
                     (3)     Where a decision is taken to  remove  a  person
                 under regulation 19(3)(b), the person is to be  treated  as
                 if he were a person to whom section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act
                 (liability to deportation) applied and section  5  of  that
                 Act (procedure for deportation) and Schedule 3 to that  Act
                 (supplementary provision as to deportation)  are  to  apply
                 accordingly. [emphasis added]

5.    The effect of these  provisions  is  that  removal  of  EEA  nationals
    because they cease to have a right to reside under EU law is treated as
    a form of administrative removal. A decision to remove  on  grounds  of
    public policy is treated as a deportation decision. They are  different
    forms of decision distinct from one another.

6.    The decision made by the Secretary of State on 21  December  2016  was
    not a "relevant decision" to remove the appellant on grounds of  public
    policy under regulations 21 and 24(3). It  was  issued  by  way  of  an
    IS.151A immigration notice, which makes clear  that  the  decision  was
    made with reference to regulations  19(3)(a)  and  24(2).  The  reasons
    given for removing the appellant were as follows.

           "A decision has been taken under regulation 19(3)(a) of the  EEA
           regulations. Even assuming that you had been  exercising  treaty
           rights before your  incarceration,  and  having  regard  to  the
           absence of any evidence that you have acquired a permanent right
           of residence or had any  other  right  of  residence  under  the
           Citizens or Free Movement Directive, your 10 month  imprisonment
           cannot constitute lawful residence for he  purposes  of  EU  law
           (see the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union
           in  Onuekwere  [2014]  EUECJ  C-378/12,  [2014]  INLR  613   and
           Secretary of State for the Home Department v MG [2014] EUECJ  C-
           400/12. [2014] Imm  AR  561,  [2014]  WLR  2441)  and  you  have
           therefore ceased to have a right  to  reside  and,  in  all  the
           circumstances, it would be proportionate to remove you."

The First-tier Tribunal decision

7.    Designated Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Shaerf  ("the  judge")
    allowed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 27 June 2018. At  [3-4]
    of the decision he noted that the respondent made a decision to  remove
    the appellant because it was said that he ceased to  have  a  right  to
    reside in the United Kingdom. The judge went on to  note  the  evidence
    given by the appellant and his partner and the points  put  forward  by
    both parties. He went on to make the following findings:

                      "27.     I  have  identified  a  number  of   apparent
                 inconsistencies  and  discrepancies  as  well  as  lack  of
                 evidence of certain elements of the Appellant's claim.  The
                 Appellant's academic record shows limited achievements  and
                 I have to take account of this when assessing his  evidence
                 and credibility. His partner appeared reluctant to  divulge
                 information unless pressed. Consequently, I  conclude  that
                 between the Appellant and his partner I have not been given
                 a complete and full picture of their circumstances.  I  can
                 attach little weight to  his  claim  to  be  at  risk  from
                 Lithuanian gangs here  and  in  Lithuania  because  of  the
                 alleged incident at a party in Lithuania.

                        28.  The Appellant  started  his  education  in  the
                 United Kingdom on 25 September 2006 at Mayfield  School.  A
                 start at schools some two or three weeks after commencement
                 of the academic year would indicate that his family did not
                 arrive in the United  Kingdom  until  August  or  September
                 2006. He was remanded in custody and remained in custody to
                 serve his prison sentence from 12 July 2016.  Consequently,
                 before his imprisonment he  had  not  completed  10  years'
                 residence.  I  find  that  he  had  completed  five  years'
                 residence by then and that such  residence  was  lawful  in
                 accordance with the 2006 Regs. because he was in  education
                 between 25 September 2006 and  July  2010.  Thereafter  the
                 Appellant states he had a variety of jobs but there  is  no
                 documentary evidence of any of them or of any period of job
                 seeking until a period  before  the  registration  with  an
                 employment agency leading to the offer of  employment  said
                 to start on the Monday after the hearing.  Looking  at  the
                 Appellant's history, I am satisfied that he was entitled to
                 a right of permanent residence before 12 July 2016."

8.    Even though he summarised the decision was to remove on  grounds  that
    the appellant ceased to have a right to reside under EU law earlier  in
    his decision, the judge went on to consider the case with reference  to
    the provisions contained in regulation 21, which related to removal  on
    public policy  grounds  [29-35].   The  judge  considered  whether  the
    appellant could benefit from  the  highest  level  of  protection  from
    removal on  public  policy  grounds  under  regulation  21(4)  where  a
    'relevant decision' could only be taken on imperative grounds of public
    security in respect of an EEA national who has resided  in  the  United
    Kingdom for a continuous period of at least  ten  years  prior  to  the
    relevant decision. The judge had regard to the opinion of the  Advocate
    General in the matter of the referral made by the Supreme Court in SSHD
    v Vomero [2016] UKSC 49.  In  fact,  by  the  date  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing on 10 May 2018 the Court of Justice  of  the  European
    Union (CJEU) had recently given judgment in B v Land  Baden-W�rttemberg
    and SSHD v Vomero [2018] EUECJ C-316/16. It made no material difference
    to the judge's findings because the Grand  Chamber  came  to  the  same
    conclusion as the Advocate General regarding the  need  to  demonstrate
    the acquisition of a right of permanent residence as a pre-requisite to
    highest protection from expulsion on grounds of  10  years'  continuous
    residence prior to the relevant decision.

9.    The judge concluded that the appellant's period  of  imprisonment  did
    not break the integrative links that he had with the  UK  and  that  he
    qualified for enhanced protection [32]. He  went  on  to  consider  the
    appellant's personal circumstances and concluded that removal  was  not
    proportionate with reference either to the criteria for  removal  of  a
    person with a permanent right of residence or under  the  enhanced  10-
    year level of protection from removal [35]. Finally, the judge went  on
    to  conclude  that  the  appellant's  removal   would   amount   to   a
    disproportionate breach of his rights under Article 8 of  the  European
    Convention [36].

The Secretary of State's appeal

10.   The Secretary of State appeals the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on
    the following grounds:

       i) The judge failed to give adequate reasons to explain how and  why
          he concluded that the appellant had acquired a right of permanent
          residence.


          (a)    The judge considered the fact that the  appellant  was  in
                 education from September 2006 to July  2010  (a  period  of
                 less than four years). In finding that this  was  a  lawful
                 period of residence  under  the  EEA  Regulations  2006  he
                 failed to take into account the fact that an  EEA  national
                 residing as  a  student  needed  to  show  that  they  were
                 enrolled at  an  accredited  education  establishment,  had
                 comprehensive sickness insurance and must  have  sufficient
                 resources not to become a burden on the  social  assistance
                 system of the host Member State.

                 (b)    The  judge  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for
                 apparently accepting the appellant's evidence that, for the
                 remaining part of his initial five-year period of residence
                 in the UK, he was exercising rights as a worker. In view of
                 the doubts expressed at [27] about the reliability  of  the
                 appellant as a witness, it was necessary for the  judge  to
                 give reasons to explain why  he  accepted  the  appellant's
                 evidence given that he noted that there was no  documentary
                 evidence to support the appellant's claim.

      ii) In determining  the  appeal  with  reference  to  the  provisions
          relating to removal on grounds of public policy under  regulation
          21 the judge applied the wrong legal provisions. He conflated the
          issues relating  to  ceasing  to  exercise  rights  of  residence
          (administrative removal) with removal on  public  policy  grounds
          (deportation) under the EEA Regulations  2006.  The  case  should
          have been considered with reference to regulation 19(3)(a).

     iii) The First-tier Tribunal erred in allowing  the  appeal  on  human
          rights grounds.

11.   The appellant is unrepresented. Perhaps  unsurprisingly,  he  did  not
    lodge a written response to the Secretary of State's appeal  (see  rule
    24 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

Decision and reasons

12.   After having considered  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  and  the
    grounds of appeal we are  satisfied  that  the  decision  involved  the
    making of errors of law and must be set aside.

13.   In light of the legal framework set  out  above  it  becomes  apparent
    that the First-tier Tribunal determined the appeal  with  reference  to
    the wrong framework. Unusually, in a decision involving the  conviction
    of an EEA national for a criminal offence, the Secretary of  State  did
    not make a 'relevant decision' on public policy  grounds.  Instead,  he
    decided to administratively remove the appellant because  it  was  said
    that he ceased to exercise his rights under EU law during his period of
    imprisonment. However, the Secretary of State's reliance  on  Onuekwere
    and MG in the decision notice was equally erroneous. Those cases relate
    to the assessment of 10-year period giving rise to an enhanced level of
    protection from expulsion on public policy grounds, which had little to
    do with the assessment of whether a person ceased  to  exercise  Treaty
    rights for the purpose of administrative removal.

14.   We are also satisfied that the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for concluding that the appellant had acquired a right
    of permanent residence for the reasons outlined  in  the  Secretary  of
    State's grounds.

15.   There are several ways in which the appellant might have been able  to
    show that he had acquired a permanent right of residence. When he was a
    child the most obvious route might have been through his dependency  on
    his parents if they were exercising rights of free movement in the  UK.
    If the appellant was able to show a  continuous  period  of  dependency
    upon his parents up until the age of 21 years old,  and  could  produce
    evidence to show that one of them was working or  otherwise  exercising
    rights of free movement for a continuous period of five  years,  it  is
    likely that he could  show  that  he  acquired  a  right  of  permanent
    residence. However, this issue does not appear to have been explored at
    the First-tier Tribunal hearing.

16.   Instead, the judge considered a period of nearly four-years  in  which
    the appellant was in education. In order to find this period was lawful
    residence under EU  law  the  judge  needed  to  consider  whether  the
    appellant met the requirements contained  in  Article  7(1)(c)  of  the
    Citizens Directive (2004/38/EC), which was reflected in regulation 4(d)
    of  the  EEA  Regulations  2006.  This  essential  part  of  the  legal
    assessment was missing from the judge's findings.

17.   At [28] the judge apparently took into account  the  possibility  that
    the appellant was working and exercising Treaty rights to complete  the
    five-year period of continuous residence after he finished school.  The
    judge noted that there was  no  documentary  evidence  to  support  the
    appellant's claim. It was open to the judge, having heard oral evidence
    from the appellant, to accept his claim that he  undertook  periods  of
    work. However, given that  he  had  expressed  some  doubts  about  the
    reliability of the appellant as a  witness  at  [27]  adequate  reasons
    needed to be given for accepting the unsupported evidence given by  the
    appellant at the hearing. This element is also missing from the judge's
    reasoning at [28]. For these  reasons  we  conclude  that  the  judge's
    conclusions relating to the acquisition  of  permanent  residence  also
    involved the making of errors of law.

18.   It is not necessary to go into much detail about the final  ground  of
    appeal relating to human rights. There was no evidence to suggest  that
    the appellant was asked to complete a notice under section 120  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  ("the  NIAA  2002"):  see
    Amirteymour and others (EEA appeals; human rights)  [2015]  UKUT  00466
    and TY (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 1233. The appellant  was  not
    appealing a decision to refuse a human rights claim. The only ground of
    appeal against a decision taken under EEA Regulations  is  whether  the
    decision breaches the person's rights under the EU Treaties in  respect
    of entry to or residence  in  the  United  Kingdom:  see  paragraph  1,
    Schedule 1 of the EEA Regulations 2006. For these  reasons  the  First-
    tier Tribunal also erred in determining  the  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds.

19.   When the public policy considerations are taken out of  the  equation,
    the question of whether the appellant ceased to have a right to  reside
    under EU law because of a short period of incarceration  of  less  than
    six months  gave  rise  to  a  completely  different  assessment  under
    regulation 19(3)(a).

20.   We note that the decision of the CJEU in Orfanopoulos  and  Oliveri  v
    Land Baden-W�rttemberg [2004] EUECJ C-482/01 stated that the fact  that
    a  person  who  was  previously  employed  was  not  available  on  the
    employment market during a period of imprisonment does not mean,  as  a
    general rule, that he did not continue to be part of the  labour  force
    of the host Member State during that period,  provided  that  he  finds
    another job within a reasonable time after release [50].

21.   We are conscious of the fact that the appellant succeeded  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, was unrepresented and did  not  attend  the  Upper
    Tribunal hearing.  We  have  considered  whether  the  errors  we  have
    identified would have made any material difference to  the  outcome  of
    the appeal such that, despite those errors, the appeal would inevitably
    have been allowed.

22.   A sustainable finding that the  appellant  had  acquired  a  right  of
    permanent  residence  is  likely  to  be  a  complete  answer   to   an
    administrative removal decision under regulation 19(3)(a)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations 2006. Once a person  has  acquired  a  right  of  permanent
    residence it matters not if there are breaks in the exercise of  Treaty
    rights. The person is settled in the UK. On the limited  evidence  that
    appears to have been before the First-tier Tribunal at the date of  the
    hearing in May 2018 it could not be said that it was obvious  that  the
    appellant would have succeeded in showing that he had acquired a  right
    of permanent residence.

23.    Even  if  the  appellant  had  not  acquired  a  right  of  permanent
    residence, in principle, if he continued to  exercise  rights  of  free
    movement by obtaining employment within a  reasonable  time  after  his
    release from prison, he could and should have succeeded  in  an  appeal
    against a decision to remove him under regulation 19(3)(a). As long  as
    the appellant could show that he was exercising his  Treaty  rights  at
    the date of the hearing it could not be said that he ceased to  have  a
    right to reside in the UK under EU law.

24.   In assessing whether the errors we have identified made  any  material
    difference to the outcome of the appeal we take into account  the  fact
    that there appears to have been no evidence, apart from the appellant's
    oral evidence that he was due to start temporary  work  as  a  forklift
    driver the following week, to show that he was likely to be working  at
    the date of the hearing. The judge  expressed  some  doubts  about  his
    reliability as a witness and made no clear finding whether he  accepted
    the appellant's  evidence  in  this  respect.  Because  the  First-tier
    Tribunal determined the  appeal  with  reference  to  the  wrong  legal
    framework the issue did not appear to be  properly  ventilated  at  the
    hearing with reference to regulation 19(3)(a). Even  if  the  appellant
    was not working, it is possible  that  the  he  may  also  have  had  a
    continuing right of residence under EU  law  through  his  relationship
    with his partner and child, who also appear to  be  European  Citizens,
    but again, the issue did not appear to be explored at the hearing.

25.   We have found errors of law in all  the  main  findings  made  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal  in  relation  to  (i)  the  findings  relating  to
    permanent residence; (ii) the application of the wrong legal framework;
    and (iii) in determining human rights issues. In the end, the  evidence
    and findings relating to whether the appellant  was  exercising  Treaty
    rights at the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing is lacking and it
    could not be said that it was inevitable that  the  appeal  would  have
    been allowed  despite  the  errors.  Other  issues,  although  arguably
    relevant, did not appear to be discussed at the hearing  and  were  not
    the subject of clear findings. For these reasons we conclude that it is
    not possible to say that the errors made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    would not have made any material  difference  to  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal. Our findings relating to  the  errors  of  law  mean  that  the
    decision must be set aside in its entirety.

26.   Paragraph 7.2 of the Tribunal Practice Statement  dated  25  September
    2012 states that the normal approach to determining appeals will be for
    the Upper Tribunal to remake rather than remit the appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied  that  the  nature
    and extent of any judicial fact finding is such that, having regard  to
    the overriding objective, it is appropriate to remit. In this case, the
    decision was made on a wholly erroneous basis and none of the  findings
    can stand. In the circumstances, we conclude that it is appropriate for
    the appeal to be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    hearing.

Note for the Secretary of State

27.   We note that the  appellant  is  currently  imprisoned.  On  the  last
    occasion this case  came  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  the  judge  who
    adjourned the case was told that the appellant was facing another trial
    in the Crown Court. At the date of the hearing before us, Mr Kotas  was
    unable to provide any further information  about  the  outcome  of  the
    trial. We only mention this point because of the unusual approach taken
    by the Secretary  of  State  in  making  a  decision  under  regulation
    19(3)(a) of the EEA Regulations  2006  rather  than  on  public  policy
    grounds under regulation 21 (as it then was). We indicated to Mr  Kotas
    that the Secretary of State may wish to consider his position in  light
    of what we have  said  about  the  relevant  legal  framework  in  this
    particular appeal. Whether the Secretary of State decides  to  maintain
    the decision dated 21 December  2016  to  administratively  remove  the
    appellant is a matter for him, but it  seems  to  us  that  the  hiatus
    between  this  hearing  and  the  next  provides  an  opportunity   for
    reflection and review.

Note for Mr Antulis

28.   We are conscious of the fact that Mr Antulis is unrepresented  and  is
    unlikely to have relevant legal expertise. If the appeal goes ahead  it
    may assist the  First-tier  Tribunal  if  the  appellant  prepares  the
    following evidence for submission (to the First-tier Tribunal  and  the
    relevant Home Office Presenting Officers Unit) at least 14 days  before
    the next hearing.

       i) A witness statement or letter giving a detailed  account  of  his
          life in the UK including his personal life and his work  history.
          In particular, the details of his early years, who he lived with,
          who he was dependent upon and whether the people upon whom he was
          dependent were working in the UK  throughout  the  period.  Where
          possible the appellant should try to obtain evidence  to  support
          what he says in his witness statement e.g. if he or  one  of  his
          parents was working, to produce evidence of the fact.


      ii) A witness statement or letter from  his  partner  confirming  her
          nationality, whether she is  working  in  the  UK  and  giving  a
          detailed account of the history  of  their  relationship.  Again,
          anything said in the witness statement  should  be  supported  by
          evidence where possible.

     iii) A copy  of  their  child's  birth  certificate  and  evidence  of
          nationality.

      iv) Any other evidence Mr Antulis wants the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
          consider.
