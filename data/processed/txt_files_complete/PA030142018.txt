Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Bandegani, Counsel, instructed by Joint Council
                    for the Welfare of Immigrants
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellant is appealing against the decision of First-tier Tribunal
Judge Siddall ("the judge") promulgated on 10 October 2019 dismissing his
protection and asylum claim.

The appeal turned on whether the appellant is a citizen of Syria.  The
judge found that he is not.

At paragraph 16, when summarising the applicable law, the judge described
the standard of proof as being "substantial grounds for believing".

However, later in the decision the judge appeared to apply a different
standard of proof.  At paragraph 69 the judge stated, "I find it more
likely than not that he has spent a significant period of time in Egypt".
At paragraph 70 the judge stated, "on the balance of probabilities..." and
then later in the same paragraph "I find it more likely than not...".

Before me, Ms Everett conceded that the judge had erred by not applying the
correct standard of proof. I agree. Although the self-direction as to the
standard of proof at paragraph 16 was correct, the terminology used in
paragraphs 69 and 70, as quoted above, indicates that the judge did not
carry the self-direction through into the evaluation of the evidence and
that the wrong standard of proof (balance of probabilities) was applied.

The parties were in agreement that the appropriate course of action is
remittal to the First-tier Tribunal for the matter to be heard afresh.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

The decision contains a material error of law and is set aside.

The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh before
a different judge.
