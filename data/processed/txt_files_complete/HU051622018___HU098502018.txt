                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-Tier
        Tribunal Judge Lenier ('the Judge') promulgated on 20 December 2018
        in which  the  Judge  dismissed  the  appeals  of  the  appellants,
        citizens of Pakistan, on human rights grounds.
     2. Permission to appeal was refused by another judge of the First-Tier
        Tribunal on 21 January 2019 and by a judge of the Upper Tribunal on
        13 March 2019 following a renewed  application  for  permission  to
        appeal.
     3. The appellant appealed to the High Court on  a  'Cart'  application
        resulting in permission to appeal being granted by that  Court  for
        the reasons set out below.
     4. The matter comes before the  Upper  Tribunal  for  it  to  consider
        whether the Judge erred in law in a manner material to the decision
        to dismiss the appeal.



Background


     5. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan born on 23 January 1982 and
        6 April 1989 respectively. They are married and have a  child  born
        in the United Kingdom on 9 June 2017. An application for  leave  to
        remain on the basis of the first appellant's long residence made on
        19 September 2016 was refused on 5 February 2018  for  the  reasons
        set out at [2 - 16] of the decision under challenge in relation  to
        the first appellant and [17] in relation to  the  second  appellant
        whose application as a dependent upon the first appellant  fell  in
        line.
     6. Having considered the documentary and oral evidence the Judge  sets
        out findings of fact from [69] of the decision under challenge.
     7. It is not disputed the first appellant entered the  United  Kingdom
        on 6 February 2006 and so by the date of  the  hearing  before  the
        Judge had resided lawfully for over  12  years  although  an  issue
        arose as  to  whether  the  first  appellant  met  the  suitability
        requirements pursuant  to  paragraph  276B(ii)(c)  and  (iii).  The
        respondent also refused the application by reference  to  paragraph
        322(5), a general ground of refusal.
     8. Paragraph 276B the Rules sets out the requirements for a  grant  of
        indefinitely leave to remain on the basis of long residence in  the
        following terms:

         276B. The requirements to be met by  an  applicant  for  indefinite
         leave to remain on the ground  of  long  residence  in  the  United
         Kingdom are that:


         (i) (a) he has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence in
         the United Kingdom.


         (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons  why
         it would be undesirable for him to be  given  indefinite  leave  to
         remain on the ground of long residence, taking into account his:
             (a) age; and
             (b) strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and
             (c)   personal   history,   including   character,    conduct,
             associations and employment record; and
             (d) domestic circumstances; and
             (e) compassionate circumstances; and
             (f) any representations received on the person's behalf; and


         (iii) the applicant does not fall for  refusal  under  the  general
         grounds for refusal.


         (iv) the applicant has demonstrated  sufficient  knowledge  of  the
         English language and sufficient knowledge about life in the  United
         Kingdom, in accordance with Appendix KoLL.


         (v) the applicant must not be in the UK in  breach  of  immigration
         laws, except that, where paragraph 39E of these Rules applies,  any
         current period of overstaying will  be  disregarded.  Any  previous
         period of  overstaying  between  periods  of  leave  will  also  be
         disregarded where -


             (a) the previous application was made before 24 November  2016
             and within 28 days of the expiry of leave; or


             (b) the further application was made on or after  24  November
             2016 and paragraph 39E of these Rules applied.


     9. Paragraph 322(5) provides that leave  to  remain  or  variation  of
        leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  should   normally   be
        refused.....


             (5)  The undesirability of permitting the person concerned  to
                  remain in the United Kingdom in the light of  his  conduct
                  (including convictions which do not fall within  paragraph
                  322 (1C), character or associations or the  fact  that  he
                  represents a threat to national security.


    10. The respondent believed these provisions were engaged as it is said
        the first appellant  had  used  deception/dishonesty.  It  was  not
        disputed the first appellant had declared different income  figures
        initially to the Home Office and HMRC which resulted in a potential
        advantage to him; the higher income figures declared  to  the  Home
        Office in 2011 and 2013 meaning he gained additional points for his
        Tier 1 application whereas the lower  income  figures  declared  to
        HMRC in his 2010/11 and 2012/13 tax returns meant he initially paid
        less tax than was owed.
    11. The Judge records at [74] that it was not disputed that  the  first
        appellant had later contacted HMRC and voluntarily  disclosed  what
        he claimed were errors in his tax returns and that he  subsequently
        repaid the necessary tax along with interest and that HMRC had  not
        imposed  any  penalty  which,  according  to  the   guidance,   was
        consistent with them regarding the  first  appellant's  actions  as
        having been careless rather than dishonest. The Judge records  that
        the final income figures accepted by HMRC  were  broadly,  although
        not entirely, in line with the level of income the first  appellant
        originally declared to the Home Office in his Tier 1 application.
    12. The Judge records at [75] that the first appellant's case was  that
        the two discrepancies in the tax returns were errors perpetrated by
        his accountants which he corrected once he became  aware  of  them.
        The level of income claimed in both Tier 1 applications was said to
        be correct with the first appellant pointing out he  had  submitted
        management accounts along with all  the  other  required  documents
        with his application. On both occasions the documents were accepted
        by the Home Office caseworker who considered that they corroborated
        the claimed income. In  accounting  for  some  of  the  discrepancy
        between income levels declared to the Secretary of State  and  HMRC
        the first appellant relied upon the different 12-month periods that
        each had considered.
    13. The Judge considered the Home Office applications and  tax  returns
        relating to the application of 4th April 2011  between  [77  -  82]
        recording in the final two paragraphs the following:


             81.  Whilst the revised HMRC figure was slightly different  to
                  that declared initially to the Home Office, I am satisfied
                  it was sufficiently close to the original figure that  the
                  difference can be accounted for by the different 12  month
                  periods considered.


             82.  There is sufficient credible evidence to show  Mr  Amin's
                  declaration of income to the Home Office in support of his
                  Tier 1 application of  4  April  2011  was  accurate.  The
                  respondent has not shown, in respect of this  application,
                  that Mr Amin was dishonest or used deception.


    14. The Judge considered the application of 22 May 2013 between  [83  -
        87] concluding in the final paragraphs:


             86.  I have, again, taken into account that the refusal letter
                  accepted the later recalculated tax  liability  from  HMRC
                  was "more in line with those claimed to UKVI  as  part  of
                  the Tier  1  application."  The  revised  tax  calculation
                  showed total income received �32,807.


             87.  The revised figure would not have entitled Mr Amin to  be
                  awarded 20 points under the "previous earnings"  category,
                  as this required earnings between �35,000 and  �39,999.99,
                  at the  relevant  time.  However,  there  was  a  six-week
                  difference between the two twelve month periods relied  on
                  by the Home Office and HMRC. Given this, and  the  fact  I
                  placed weight upon the chartered accountants letter (which
                  I assumed was based on financial evidence  that  they  had
                  examined), I accepted there  was  sufficient  evidence  to
                  support Mr Amin's original declaration of  income  to  the
                  Home Office in support of his  Tier  1  application  being
                  accurate. The respondent has not shown, in respect of this
                  application, that Mr Amin was dishonest or used  deception
                  when declaring his level of income.


    15. The Judge thereafter considers the tax returns commencing  with  an
        assessment of the 2010/2011 tax return to HMRC between [88 -  112].
        The Judge notes the first appellant did not dispute the figures  in
        the refusal letter regarding the income he  initially  declared  to
        HMRC. At [91] the Judge notes the first appellant's explanation for
        the discrepancy was that he had relied upon his  accountant,  Ghani
        and Co when submitting the tax returns claiming the error in income
        was because they made a mistake in the preparation of the accounts.
        At [93] the Judge noted the appellant also  relied  upon  a  letter
        from TM Financial Services Ltd dated 2 January 2016 confirming  the
        first  appellant  had  asked  them  to  "investigate  the   figures
        individually and compare the figures  of  the  management  accounts
        against tax returns for the years 2010/11,  2011/12  and  2012/13."
        The Judge notes at [95] that according  to  TM  Financial  Services
        account of their instructions from the first  appellant  they  were
        asked from the outset to compare income figures from the management
        accounts to those on the tax returns. The first appellant  had  not
        just asked  TM  to  check  the  accounts  generally,  as  would  be
        expected, but specifically directed their attention to the  problem
        they later found to  exist.  The  Judge  concludes  this  was  more
        supportive of the first appellant's prior  awareness  that  such  a
        problem existed and was less supportive and an innocent  error,  of
        which he was unaware. At [96] the Judge writes:


             96.  It was not consistent with his account  of  never  having
                  seen or been  sent  the  tax  return  or  his  alternative
                  explanation that he was sent a copy of the return in 2013,
                  but he never looked at it. If this was the case, it  would
                  be expected that TM would  discover  the  relevant  error,
                  rather than being directed to it in  initial  instructions
                  by Mr Amin.


    16. The Judge concludes from analysing the evidence  relating  to  this
        document the following between [109 - 112]:


             109.     I also noted  that  the  TM  letter  confirmed  that,
                  during the year when no immigration application was  made,
                  which  was  2011/12,  "you  did  not  produce   management
                  accounts for the year." It was  striking  that  Mr  Amin's
                  overall earnings were very significantly less than  either
                  of the two surrounding years, when he did make immigration
                  applications. His gross earnings during  2011/12  amounted
                  only to �18,551. During  2010/11,  his  earnings  exceeded
                  �35,000. During 2012/12  his  earnings  exceeded  �30,000.
                  However, he declared  no  error  in  the  tax  return  for
                  2011/12.


             110.     Whilst this evidence is, at best, circumstantial,  it
                  did show an unusually large blip in earnings,  potentially
                  consistent with deliberate underreporting of earnings  for
                  all three years, but figures being amended only  where  it
                  was necessary  to  prove  higher  income  for  immigration
                  purposes.


             111.     In relation to this report of income to HMRC, Mr Amin
                  produce the penalty notice from HMRC, dated 22 July  2016,
                  this stated, "we will not charge a penalty  based  on  the
                  additional amount of tax  shown  on  this  return",  (page
                  218).


             112.     I am satisfied Mr Amin's account regarding submission
                  of  his  tax  return,  and  its  later   amendment   raise
                  potentially significant discrepancies, which  are  further
                  considered below in the  context  of  the  evidence  as  a
                  whole.


    17. The Judge considers the 2012/2013 tax return to HMRC between [113 -
        126] in which the Judge finds at [123 - 126]:


             123.     I am not satisfied that any satisfactory  explanation
                  has been provided by IH Accountants or by Mr Amin for what
                  was said to be an error in the tax return. The letter from
                  TM Financial  Services  stated  that  there  had  been  an
                  "understated discrepancy of �7481 in the tax return, under
                  the subheading of  Your  Turnover".  This  discrepancy  is
                  investigated and no  valid  reasons  are  found  why  this
                  figure was left out in the first place".


             124.     Mr Amin did not mention  this  letter  from  TM  when
                  writing to HMRC, when he reported his correct turnover  is
                  �9750. Given the difference in earnings from self-employed
                  considered above,  it  is  clear  that  the  two  turnover
                  figures for  self-employed  were  very  different  indeed.
                  Whilst TM did not provide the  specific  figures,  if  the
                  discrepancy was �7451 and the correct  figure  was  �9750,
                  then it appears Mr Amin must initially have told HMRC that
                  he had made only about �2500 in  turnover,  but  he  later
                  told them this figure was closer to �10,000.


             125.     This was  a  very  noticeable  difference.  Moreover,
                  turnover, which is simply a measure of total sales, should
                  be easily calculable by adding up payments for work  done.
                  It appears inherently improbable that  an  error  of  this
                  magnitude from what should be a simple  calculation  would
                  be made either by Mr Amin or by his accountants.


             126.     Again, in relation to the 2012/2013 tax return, I  am
                  satisfied  Mr  Amin's  account  raised  serious  potential
                  issues, further considered below in  the  context  of  the
                  evidence as a whole.


    18.  The  Judge  summarises  the  overall  findings  pursuant  to   the
        Immigration Rules between [127 - 160] in which the Judge finds that
        certain factors point towards Mr  Amin  having  used  deception  or
        dishonesty in his tax  returns,  rather  than  having  made  honest
        errors although accepting it was necessary to consider the evidence
        as  a  whole  before  concluding  whether  or  not  this  had  been
        established by the respondent [127].
    19. The Judge had the benefit of seeing and hearing Mr Amin  give  oral
        evidence and did not find him to be a credible  witness  [128]  for
        the reasons set out in the decision under challenge.
    20. At [135] the Judge finds:


             135.     It stretches credulity, in my view, that not only had
                  two sets of accountants failed to send him a  tax  return,
                  but, in both cases, this resulted in a major  error  going
                  undetected. Moreover, the end result of both  errors  that
                  Mr Amin's income  was  substantially  less,  and  he  paid
                  substantially less tax.


    21. The Judge took into account the fact the first appellant  disclosed
        the errors to HMRC voluntarily although noted the first appellant's
        oral evidence that he only  did  so  after  receiving  advice  from
        immigration solicitors who told him that previous earnings would be
        scrutinised in the long residence application which the  Judge  was
        satisfied was the likely impetus to declare the mistakes to HMRC.
    22. At [137] the Judge finds:


             137.      Moreover,  during  the  year  when  no   immigration
                  application was made, Mr Amin's income remained relatively
                  very low compared to the surrounding two years, so he paid
                  much less tax. However, no error was  discovered  in  this
                  tax return. This overall picture was much more  consistent
                  with deliberate dishonesty, rather than innocent error.


    23. The Judge also finds the differential between figures disclosed  to
        the Home Office and HMRC was so large it  was  reasonably  expected
        the first appellant would notice the tax was too low [138].
    24. The Judge found the use of different accountants for  the  purposes
        of immigration applications and tax  returns  and  the  use  of  TM
        Financial Services, who do not appear to be qualified  accountants,
        evidence of a further potentially suspicious factor.
    25. The Judge noted there was no  explanation  for  the  error  in  the
        second tax return noting at [141] the first appellant did not blame
        either accountant or referred to the fact they had not sent in  the
        tax return for checking when writing to HMRC.
    26. At [144 - 145] the Judge writes:


             144.     I note that HMRC were unaware of the  very  different
                  level of  income  shown  by  the  management  accounts  of
                  Pursglove and  Brown,  which  were  prepared  for  a  very
                  similar period. HMRC were not sent  these  accounts.  They
                  were also unaware that, virtually simultaneously, Mr  Amin
                  was  declaring  a  much  higher  income  for   immigration
                  purposes. They were unaware that he  declared  the  errors
                  only after receiving immigration advice that his  previous
                  earnings  would  be  considered  when  he  made  his  next
                  application, which provided an impetus to him to  increase
                  them in line with what he had originally declared  to  the
                  Home Office. Had HMRC been privy to this information, I am
                  satisfied  that  they  might  well  have  formed  a   very
                  different view.


             145.     For the avoidance of doubt, I am satisfied, based  on
                  the evidence as a whole, that the respondent has  met  the
                  initial evidential burden in terms of his assessment  that
                  the appellant misrepresented his earnings in both  of  the
                  relevant tax returns. I do not accept that the appellant's
                  explanation was credible  or  met  the  minimum  level  of
                  plausibility. I  am  satisfied  that  the  respondent  has
                  established  that  Mr  Amin  used  to  dishonesty   and/or
                  deception when submitting his tax returns the 2010/11  and
                  2012/13.


    27. Having found dishonesty proven the Judge  then  considered  whether
        paragraph 322(5) applied making the first appellant's  presence  in
        the UK undesirable given his conduct between [146 - 156]  in  which
        the Judge concluded that there  was  sufficient  reliable  evidence
        which calls into question Mr Amin's character and  conduct  to  the
        extent that it is undesirable to allow him to remain in the  United
        Kingdom, in accordance with paragraph 322(5).
    28. Thereafter the Judge considers the merits of the appeal pursuant to
        article 8  ECHR,  this  being  a  human  rights  appeal,  including
        consideration of the  best  interests  of  the  child  pursuant  to
        section 55 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.
    29. The Judge finds at [164] when considering the weight to be given to
        the public interest in this case,


             164.     Nonetheless this form of dishonesty is very  serious.
                  The findings in relation to the tax returns weigh  heavily
                  in favour of the public interest in removal. In accordance
                  with  section  117  B(1),  the  maintenance  of  effective
                  immigration controls is in the public interest,  and  this
                  factor weighs heavily against the appellant's,  given  the
                  use of deception.


    30. The Judge sets out the conclusion on the proportionality  issue  at
        [168] in the following terms:


             168.     Whilst I accept that both appellants have established
                  a private and family life  here,  and  it  was  clear  the
                  couple were well liked within the  community,  overall,  I
                  did not accept that  there  was  sufficiently  exceptional
                  factors to outweigh the strong public interest in removal.
                  I am satisfied the removal decision  is  proportionate  to
                  the legitimate aim in this case,  which  is  the  economic
                  well-being of the United Kingdom. One aspect of  this  aim
                  is the maintenance of effective immigration  control.  The
                  appeals are dismissed.


    31. The  appellants  challenged  the  decision  in  relation  to  which
        permission to appeal was eventually granted by the High  Court  for
        the following reasons:


             1. The claimant seeks  permission  to  bring  judicial  review
                proceedings with respect to the determination of UTJ  Judge
                Caravan dated 13 March  2019  refusing  permission  to  the
                claimant to appeal  the  determination  of  the  FTT  Judge
                Lenier promulgated on 20 December 2018.
             2. The first and second claimants are  citizens  of  Pakistan.
                Their respective dates of birth on  23  April  1982  and  6
                April 1989. They are married and have a child who was  born
                in the UK on 9 June 2017. The first claimant entered the UK
                on a student visa he has been lawfully in the  UK  pursuant
                to a variety of  visas  since  2006.  The  second  claimant
                entered the UK as a dependent spouse on 4 August 2015.  She
                too has been in the UK lawfully since that date.
             3.  The  claimants  were  refused  leave  to  remain  by   the
                Defendants as a consequence of  the  determination  by  the
                Defendant that the first claimant  had  been  deceitful  or
                dishonest in his dealings with HMRC  and/or  UK  Visas  and
                that it was therefore undesirable for him to remain in  the
                UK (paragraph 322 (5) of the Immigration Rules).
             4. It is arguable that while  the  discrepancy  in  the  first
                claimant's accounts gives rise to a suspicion of dishonesty
                that discrepancy was dispelled by the evidence provided  by
                the first claimant and there was an error of law in the FTT
                Judges determination. The decision of the Court  of  Appeal
                in Balajigari & Ors v SSHD [2019]  EWCA  Civ  673  provides
                clear guidance as to the way  in  which  earning  disparity
                cases such as this are to be  considered  and,  unless  the
                Upper Tribunal all the interested party wishes there to  be
                a hearing of the substantive application, this is a  matter
                which requires further consideration of the Upper  Tribunal
                both with respect to the applicability of paragraph 322 (5)
                and potential interference with article 8 rights.


Error of law


    32. There had been a number of cases considering the issue of paragraph
        322(5) and the relationship between figures declared  to  HMRC  and
        UKVI. The latest providing definitive guidance is that of the Court
        of Appeal in Balajigari v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673 from  which  the
        following principles can be extracted:


        (i)  it is clear from the terms of paragraph 322 (5)  that  it  was
             not intended only to apply to cases in which there is a threat
             to national security [32];


        (ii)      para 322 (5) involves a two-stage  analysis,  whether  it
             applies first and then discretion falls to be considered [33];


        (iii)     for the first stage there must be  reliable  evidence  of
             sufficiently reprehensible conduct and an  assessment,  taking
             proper account of all relevant circumstances known  about  the
             applicant including positive features of  their  character  of
             whether their presence in the UK is undesirable [34];


        (iv)      the conduct can only be sufficiently reprehensible if  it
             is dishonest [35].  It is very hard to see how the  deliberate
             and dishonest submission of false earning figures to  HMRC  or
             the Home Office would not meet the threshold [37];


        (v)  the SSHD should incorporate the balancing  exercise  into  the
             decision-making process, in so far  as  Dadzie  and  Ojo  said
             otherwise the CA would disagree [38];


        (vi)      the guidance in Khan (see below) was  endorsed  with  the
             qualification that para 37 of the guidance  may  misstate  the
             position; a discrepancy between earnings declared to HMRC  and
             SSHD may justifiably give rise to a  suspicion  of  dishonesty
             but it does not justify that  conclusion.   It  calls  for  an
             explanation and the SSHD must  decide  in  the  light  of  the
             explanation or  lack  of  one  whether  he  is  satisfied  the
             applicant was dishonest [42];


        (vii)     where SSHD is minded  to  refuse  ILR  on  the  basis  of
             reprehensible conduct he is required as a matter of procedural
             fairness to indicate clearly to the applicant that he has that
             suspicion; to give the applicant an  opportunity  to  respond,
             both as regards the conduct itself and as  regards  any  other
             reasons relied on as regards "undesirability" and the exercise
             of the second-stage assessment; and then to take that response
             into account before drawing the  conclusion  of  reprehensible
             conduct.  There does not have to be an  interview;  a  written
             procedure may suffice  [55]  [56],  but  the  availability  of
             administrative review did  not  satisfy  the  requirements  of
             procedural fairness [58];


        (viii)    the SSHD is not bound to take the same view as HMRC [68];


        (ix)      there is no Tameside duty on the SSHD to  make  enquiries
             of HMRC as to how they have dealt with relevant  errors  [69];
             the applicant can draw attention to what action  HMRC  did  or
             did not take [75];


        (x)  in the generality of cases a  Tier  1  applicant  for  ILR  is
             likely to have built up sufficient private life for Article  8
             to be engaged by his removal [86];


        (xi)      an adverse decision by the SSHD necessarily means that if
             the applicant has leave it can be curtailed so a  person  with
             leave is equally liable to removal [90];


         (xii)    this means that the tribunal will have to  reach  its  own
             conclusions as  to  whether  the  interference  was  justified
             rather than conducting a rationality review  -  the  situation
             was analogous to Ahsan [2017] EWCA Civ 2009 [92];


         (xiii)   like Ahsan the appropriate route of challenge is by appeal
             to the FTT rather than JR to the UT [95];


         (xiv)    where an applicant has not included a human  rights  claim
             in their ILR application  they  will  need  to  make  a  fresh
             application or wait until steps are taken to  enforce  removal
             [100] [101];


         (xv)     the CA discussed the position in  the  current  litigation
      [103];


         (xvi)    the applicant will need an opportunity  to  give  evidence
             and call witnesses it is unlikely that a mere  assertion  that
             the matter was a "mistake" will be accepted without a full and
             particularised explanation of what the mistake was and how  it
             arose [106].


    33. Mr Malik referred to the correct test for assessing the  merits  of
        the claim in an appeal of this nature referring to submissions made
        by of the appellant Balajigari before the Court of Appeal  set  out
        at [34 - 39] of their judgement. At [33 - 34] the Court  of  Appeal
        write:


             33.   Against  that  background,  Mr  Biggs  submitted   that,
                  properly interpreted, paragraph 322 (5)  involves  a  two-
                  stage analysis. The  first  stage  is  to  decide  whether
                  paragraph 322 (5) applies at all - that  is,  that  it  is
                  "undesirable" to grant leave in the light of the specified
                  matters.  If  it  does,  the  2nd  stage  -   since   such
                  undesirability is  a  presumptive  rather  than  mandatory
                  ground of refusal - is to decide as a matter of discretion
                  whether leave should be refused on the basis of  it.  That
                  analysis seems to us correct in principle.


             34.  As to the first stage, Mr Biggs submitted that there  are
                  three limbs to the analysis. There must be:  (i)  reliable
                  evidence of (ii) sufficiently reprehensible  conduct;  and
                  (iii about the applicant at the date of decision,  whether
                  his or her presence in the UK is undesirable (this  should
                  include evidence of positive features of their character).
                  Again, that seems to us the correct and  helpful  analysis
                  of the exercise required at the first stage, but  it  will
                  be useful to say something more about the elements in  it,
                  especially as they apply to an earnings discrepancy case.


    34. At [35] the Court of Appeal accepted that an  earnings  discrepancy
        case could constitute  sufficient  reprehensible  conduct  for  the
        purposes of paragraph 322 (5) if but only if the discrepancy was as
        the result of dishonesty on the behalf of the appellant.
    35. It is not  disputed  that  the  provision  of  inaccurate  earnings
        figures to either  HMRC  or  the  Home  Office  in  support  of  an
        application  for  leave  under  Part  6  A  as  a  result  of  mere
        carelessness or ignorance or poor advice cannot constitute  conduct
        rendering it undesirable for the applicant to remain in the  United
        Kingdom as such errors will be genuine or innocence  in  the  sense
        they are honest and so do not meet the necessary threshold.
    36. A reading of the determination shows the Judge  was  aware  that  a
        structured approach was required.
    37. The decision of the Court of Appeal had not been handed down at the
        date of the hearing meaning the  Judge  only  had  available  as  a
        source of reference and guidance the decision of the Upper Tribunal
        in R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of State for the Home
        Department (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322 (5)) [2018]  UKUT
        38 in which it was found:


             (1) Where there has been a significant difference between  the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules  (care  see
             Balajigari above) Such an inference could  be  expected  where
             there is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy;
             (2) Where an Applicant has presented evidence  to  show  that,
             despite  the  prima  facie  inference,  he  was  not  in  fact
             dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of State  must
             decide whether the explanation and evidence is sufficient,  in
             her  view,  to  displace  the   prima   facie   inference   of
             deceit/dishonesty;
             (3) In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
             State should remind herself that,  although  the  standard  of
             proof is the "balance of probability", a finding that a person
             has been deceitful  and  dishonest  in  relation  to  his  tax
             affairs with the consequence that he is denied  settlement  in
             this  country  is  a  very  serious   finding   with   serious
             consequences;
             (4) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for
             an "error" in relation to the historical tax return  will  not
             be the end of the matter, given that the  accountant  will  or
             should have asked the taxpayer to confirm that the return  was
             accurate and to have signed the tax return.  Furthermore,  the
             Applicant will have known of his or her earnings and will have
             expected to pay tax thereon.  If the Applicant does  not  take
             steps within a reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the
             Secretary of State may  be  entitled  to  conclude  that  this
             failure justifies a conclusion that there has been  deceit  or
             dishonesty;
             (5) When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest
             or merely careless the Secretary of State should consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):


             (i) Whether the explanation for the error by the accountant is
             plausible;
             (ii) Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
             (for example, correspondence between  the  Applicant  and  his
             accountant at the time of the tax return) has  been  disclosed
             or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;
             (iii) Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had been
             made because his liability to pay tax was less than he  should
             have expected;
                  (iv) Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken steps
             to remedy the situation and, if  so,  when  those  steps  were
             taken and the explanation for any significant delay.


    38. At [42] of the decision of the Court of Appeal  decision  there  is
        specific reference to the guidance in Khan in the following terms:


             42.  Although Martin Spencer J clearly makes  the  point  that
                  the Secretary of State must carefully  consider  any  case
                  advanced  that  the   discrepancy   is   the   result   of
                  carelessness rather than dishonesty, there is in our  view
                  a  danger  that  his  "starting  point"   mis-states   the
                  position. A discrepancy between earnings declared to  HMRC
                  and to the Home Office may  justifiably  give  rise  to  a
                  suspicion that it is the result of dishonesty but it  does
                  not by itself justify a conclusion to that effect. What it
                  does is to call for an explanation. If an explanation once
                  sought is not forthcoming, or is unconvincing, it  may  at
                  that point to be legitimate  the  Secretary  of  State  to
                  infer dishonesty; but even in that case  the  position  is
                  not that there is a  legal  burden  on  the  applicant  to
                  disprove dishonesty. The Secretary of  State  must  simply
                  decide,  considering  the  discrepancy  in  light  of  the
                  explanation (or lack of it), whether he is satisfied  that
                  the appellant has been dishonest.


    39. Mr Malik refers to the finding  at  [127]  of  the  decision  under
        challenge in which  having  examined  the  evidence  regarding  the
        2010/2011 and 2012/2013 tax returns to HMRC the Judge writes:


             127.     Based on the above, I am  satisfied  certain  factors
                  pointed  towards  Mr  Amin  having   used   deception   or
                  dishonesty in his tax returns,  rather  than  having  made
                  honest errors. However it was necessary  to  consider  the
                  evidence as a whole, before concluding whether or not this
                  had been established by the respondent.


    40. It is not made out the Judge adopted an incorrect or  impermissible
        approach when finding that the appellant's conduct inferred the use
        of dishonesty or that the Judge concludes that  the  evidence  gave
        rise to suspicion in light of the decision of the Court  of  Appeal
        such as to give rise to material legal error.
    41. The Judge spent considerable time examining in detail the available
        evidence to establish whether the element of dishonest conduct  had
        been made out in this appeal. Mr Malik accepted in his  submissions
        that he could not challenge the factual findings of  the  Judge  as
        they do not on the face of it reveal any arguable  legal  error  in
        the assessment of the evidence. There is in particular no challenge
        in the grounds to the findings at [138], [139 - 145] or [150 - 155]
        of the determination under challenge in which the Judge writes:


             138.     Moreover, the  differentiation  between  the  figures
                  disclosed to the Home Office and  HMRC  was  so  large  it
                  would be reasonable to have expected that  Mr  Amin  would
                  noticed the tax was too low. In particular, this  was  the
                  case during 2012/13, in relation to the �11,000 difference
                  between the amounts earned full self-employment.


             139.     Mr Amin used four separate sets  of  accountants.  It
                  was unclear why he  used  Pursglove  and  Brown  twice  to
                  prepare  the  accounts  presented  in   support   of   his
                  immigration applications but did not use them for his  tax
                  returns for the same years, although this was likely to be
                  quicker and cheaper, as most of the work was done.


             140.     He changed accountants for  the  two  questioned  tax
                  returns. He used TM Financial Services, who did not appear
                  to  be  qualified   accountants,   to   comment   on   the
                  discrepancies on  the  accounts.  Whilst  this  could,  of
                  course, be innocent and done for logistical  purposes,  in
                  the light of the evidence as a  whole,  it  is  a  further
                  potentially suspicious factor.


             141.     There was no explanation for the error in the  second
                  tax return. IH Accountants did not provide  any  evidence,
                  although, at the date when Mr Amin was writing about  this
                  mistake to HMRC, they  were  still  trading.  Ghani  &  Co
                  provided  an  explanation  in  line  with   TM   Financial
                  Services, but  not  until,  and  neither  explanation  was
                  consistent with the letter Mr Amin wrote himself to  HMRC.
                  Moreover, he did not blame either accountant or  refer  to
                  the fact that they had not sent him  the  tax  return  for
                  checking, when writing to HMRC.


             142.     Mr Amin relied upon the lack of  penalty  imposed  by
                  HMRC.  In line with  their  standard  guidance,  this  did
                  amount to their acceptance that the understatement in  the
                  tax returns arose from  carelessness,  rather  than  being
                  deliberate.


             143.     Whilst I have taken  this  into  account,  HMRC  were
                  being told by Mr Amin that the issues arose due to a  typo
                  and an error.  They  had  no  information  from  the  Home
                  Officer so had no reason to believe there  was  any  other
                  motivation.


             144.     I note that HMRC were unaware of the  very  different
                  level of  income  shown  by  the  management  accounts  of
                  Pursglove and  Brown,  which  were  prepared  for  a  very
                  similar period. HMRC were not sent  these  accounts.  They
                  were also unaware that, virtually simultaneously, Mr  Amin
                  was  declaring  a  much  higher  income  for   immigration
                  purposes. They were unaware that he  declared  the  errors
                  only after receiving immigration advice that his  previous
                  earnings  will  be  considered  when  he  made  his   next
                  application, which provided an impetus for him to increase
                  them in line with what he had originally declared  to  the
                  Home Office. Had HMRC been privy to this information, I am
                  satisfied  that  they  might  well  have  formed  a   very
                  different view.


             145.     For the avoidance of doubt, I am satisfied, based  on
                  the evidence as a whole, that the respondent has  met  the
                  initial evidential burden in terms of his  assertion  that
                  the appellant misrepresented his earnings in both  of  the
                  relevant tax returns. I do not accept that the appellant's
                  explanation was credible  or  met  the  minimum  level  of
                  plausibility. I  am  satisfied  that  the  respondent  has
                  established that Mr Amin used dishonesty and/or  deception
                  when submitting his tax returns for 2010/11 and 2012/13.


                  ..........


             150.     In the current case, I did not accept  that  the  tax
                  returns were not sent to Mr Amin on  either  occasion,  or
                  that he was not asked to sign  these.  It  was  noticeable
                  that the signature pages were not  produced.  I  was  also
                  satisfied, for the reasons above, that the differential in
                  income figures  between  the  Home  Office  and  HMRC  was
                  sufficiently great on both occasions, that Mr Amin  should
                  have been aware that he was being asked to pay too  little
                  tax.


             151.      Whilst  Mr  Amin  did  take  steps  to  remedy   the
                  situation, this did not happen for some years, and not, in
                  my view, within  a  reasonable  time.  Moreover,  Mr  Amin
                  accepted that he took steps because he was advised to sort
                  out tax affairs  in  the  context  of  a  new  immigration
                  application. I do not believe he  would  have  taken  this
                  step without such a necessity.


             152.     There was no explanation  from  IH  Accountants  and,
                  based on the above findings, questions remained about  the
                  explanation for the entry on the tax return of 2010/11.


             153.     I have  also  taken  into  account  the  respondent's
                  policy guidance of paragraph 322 (5). I note  that  it  is
                  not necessary for a conviction to be obtained, before  the
                  paragraph applies,  although  it  is  stated  that  he  is
                  unlikely a person will be refused under character, conduct
                  or associations ground for a single conviction.


             154.     There has been no criminal prosecution in  this  case
                  and no conviction. Mr Amin is a man of good character.  He
                  has produced many character letters testifying to his well
                  respected status in the community and voluntary work  that
                  he has carried  out.  His  immigration  history  has  been
                  otherwise good. He has contributed to the economy  through
                  regular employment. I have taken all  these  factors  into
                  account.


             155.     However, I also take  into  account  that  HMRC  were
                  unaware of the accounts which were produced  by  Pursglove
                  and Co at virtually the same time as the tax  returns  and
                  the very differing levels of income that  these  betrayed.
                  Had they been so aware, I am satisfied their assessment of
                  Mr Amin's actions and  motivation  might  well  have  been
                  different and led to a much more robust response.


    42. A challenge to the finding regarding the possible reaction of  HMRC
        had they were aware of the whole history of  this  matter,  on  the
        basis that the same is speculation,  does  not  establish  arguable
        legal error. The observation by the Judge that had HMRC been  aware
        of the true position as disclosed by the differing set of  accounts
        they would have been unlikely to be of the opinion that  the  error
        was a matter of mistake or a typo is  not  an  arguably  irrational
        finding. In addition to not disclosing all the available  documents
        to HMRC, which would have led to the discrepancy  being  identified
        which would have had a number of consequences  for  the  appellant,
        the  appellant  also  clearly  sought  to  mislead  HMRC   in   the
        explanation he provided for the discrepancy between the figures set
        out in the tax returns and those he eventually disclosed  following
        the advice from his immigration solicitors.
    43. What the above  demonstrates  is  that  the  Judge  did  not  infer
        dishonesty without more. The Judge clearly  examined  the  evidence
        very  carefully  establishing  reliable  evidence  of  sufficiently
        reprehensible conduct having taken proper account of  all  relevant
        circumstances before concluding whether the appellant's presence in
        the United Kingdom was undesirable.  The  Judge  clearly  sets  out
        within this assessment the positive  features  of  the  appellant's
        character as disclosed in the evidence.
    44. Mr Malik submitted that the Judge had also erred in relation to the
        assessment of the second stage of the test which is the question of
        discretion. At [39] the Court of Appeal wrote:


             39.  Mr Biggs submitted  that  at  the  second  stage  of  the
                  analysis the Secretary of State must  separately  consider
                  whether,  notwithstanding  the  conclusion  that  it   was
                  undesirable for the applicant to  have  leave  to  remain,
                  there were factors outweighing the presumption that  leave
                  should for that reason be refused. He submitted it was  at
                  this stage that the Secretary of State must consider  such
                  factors as the welfare of any minor children  who  may  be
                  affected adversely by the decision and  any  human  rights
                  issues which arise. That seems to us in principle correct.
                  There will, though no doubt only exceptionally,  be  cases
                  where the interests of  children  or  others,  or  serious
                  problems about removal to their country  of  origin,  mean
                  that it would be wrong to refuse leave to  remain  (though
                  not necessarily indefinite leave to  remain)  to  migrants
                  whose presence is undesirable.


    45. The Judge clearly considered the  appellant's  character  at  [154]
        above, indicating there was an assessment of other aspects  in  the
        Judge's mind, before concluding the first appellants character  and
        conduct meant it was undesirable to allow  him  to  remain  in  the
        United Kingdom. Mr Malik submitted that it was not  sufficient  for
        the analysis referred to by the Court of Appeal  to  be  undertaken
        separately in an article 8 assessment as it was necessary  as  part
        of article 8 ECHR to establish whether an  appellant  was  able  to
        satisfy the  relevant  Immigration  Rules.  If  it  was  found  the
        appellant's exclusion was desirable subsequent to paragraph 322 (5)
        that was a material factor when considering the weight to be  given
        to the public interest.
    46. In this case although the Judge  concludes  it  is  undesirable  to
        allow the appellant to remain in the United Kingdom  at  [156]  and
        then goes on to consider  whether  the  appellant  could  meet  the
        requirements of the Immigration Rules relating to long residence or
        outside the rules pursuant  to  article  8  ECHR  afterwards  as  a
        separate distinct aspect of the appeal, the findings  made  by  the
        Judge in relation to that aspect  are  relevant  to  the  balancing
        exercise referred to by the  Court  of  Appeal  at  [39]  of  their
        judgement where they specifically referred to the need  to  include
        in the decision making process any human rights issues which arise.
    47. The Judge's findings at [157 - 168] are in the following terms:


             157.     As a result, I do not find that  Mr  Amin  meets  the
                  requirements of the immigration  rules  relating  to  long
                  residence, in accordance with paragraph 276B.  I  am  also
                  satisfied the suitability requirements of  the  rules  are
                  not met in  relation  to  paragraph  276ADE.  It  was  not
                  submitted that there would be very  significant  obstacles
                  to the applicant's integration into the country  to  which
                  he would have to go if required to leave the UK, and I  am
                  satisfied this provision of paragraph 276 ADE is not met.


             158.     In relation to Mrs Usman, for the avoidance of doubt,
                  there were also not  very  significant  obstacles  to  her
                  integration back into Pakistan for the  reasons  given  in
                  the decision letter. Again, no such obstacles were  raised
                  at the hearing.


             159.     The appellant's have a child, Muhammed Essa Amin, who
                  was born in the United Kingdom on 9 July 2017. He is  also
                  a national of Pakistan. Paragraph EX.1 (a) or (b)  do  not
                  apply to the  appellants,  given  they  are  nationals  of
                  Pakistan, and Muhammad has not lived here for seven years.


             160.     In light of the above findings, I  am  satisfied  the
                  requirements of the immigration rules are not met  by  the
                  appellants. I now, therefore, turn to  Article  8  outside
                  the rules  and  consider  whether  there  are  exceptional
                  circumstances which mean the  appeal  should  be  allowed.
                  However, I note the  immigration  rules  are  designed  to
                  operate on the basis that decisions  taken  in  accordance
                  with them are  compatible  with  Article  8,  in  all  but
                  exceptional cases, (Agyarko).


             161.     I firstly have to consider the best interests of  the
                  child,  Muhammed,  under  Section  55  of   the   Borders,
                  Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. His  best  interests
                  are a primary consideration.


             162.     Muhammad is a citizen of Pakistan but was born  here.
                  He lives with his parents, both of whom  are  citizens  of
                  Pakistan. He is not yet two years old. It  is  clearly  in
                  his best interests to remain with his parents  within  the
                  family unit, wherever they are  settled.  Whilst  he  will
                  already possess some limited integration here, his primary
                  integration is likely to remain within the family unit, by
                  virtue of his age. There was no disclosure of  significant
                  health problems or any other factors which would cause him
                  difficulty returning to Pakistan. In my  view,  Muhammed's
                  best interests are to remain  with  his  parents,  whether
                  they remain here or return to Pakistan.


             163.      I  have  taken  into  account  the  Mr  Amin's  long
                  residence  here  and  the  couples  otherwise  unblemished
                  immigration history. I have taken into account evidence of
                  some charity  work  carried  out  voluntarily  within  the
                  community  by  Mr  Amin.  There  were  copious   character
                  letters, speaking to the appellant's general honesty, hard
                  work and dedication. It was clear Mr Amin  and  Mrs  Usman
                  were regarded as a close and warm family unit,  considered
                  by many to  be  valuable  members  of  the  community.  It
                  appears likely that Mr Amin's use of deception  above  was
                  out of character.


             164.     Nonetheless this form of dishonesty is very  serious.
                  The findings in relation to the tax returns weigh  heavily
                  in favour of the public interest in removal. In accordance
                  with  Section  117  B(1),  the  maintenance  of  effective
                  immigration controls is in the public interest,  and  this
                  factor weighs heavily against the appellant's,  given  the
                  use of deception.


             165.     It is in the public interest that persons who seek to
                  remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English and
                  are independent financially. Whilst the appellant used  an
                  interpreter, it was clear he could speak English fluently.
                  It is also clear he was financially independent and  there
                  was no evidence of dependence upon public funds.  However,
                  Rhuppia v Sec State the Home  Department  [2018]  UKSC  58
                  confirmed that financial independence from the  state  was
                  not a positive, but a neutral factor.


             166.       It   is   necessary   to   establish    exceptional
                  circumstances. These were defined in MF (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
                  [2013] EWCA Civ 1192  as  being,  "not  .....  A  test  of
                  exceptionality"  but  as  'something   very   compelling,'
                  required to outweigh the public interest."


             167.     I  am  not  satisfied  any  such  factors  have  been
                  established. The  appellants  have  spent  most  of  their
                  formative lives in Pakistan, although  Mr  Amin  has  been
                  resident here for a very significant  period.  They  would
                  not  have  lost  their  cultural,  linguistic  or   social
                  connections there. Mr Amin is highly educated and has  had
                  much experience in IT, both as a self-employed  consultant
                  and in employment. Neither appellant produced evidence  of
                  significant health problems,  sufficient  to  impact  upon
                  removal. The family will be likely to be able  to  support
                  themselves in Pakistan.


             168.     Whilst I accept that both appellants have established
                  a private and family life  here,  and  it  was  clear  the
                  couple were well liked within the  community,  overall,  I
                  did not accept that there  were  sufficiently  exceptional
                  factors to outweigh the strong public interest in removal.
                  I am satisfied the removal decision  is  proportionate  to
                  the legitimate aim in this case,  which  is  the  economic
                  well-being of the United Kingdom. One aspect of  this  aim
                  is the maintenance of effective immigration  control.  The
                  appeals are dismissed.




    48. The Judge did not have benefit of the Court of Appeal  guidance  as
        that judgement had not been handed down by the  date  the  decision
        was promulgated. What is clear is that all relevant  aspects  which
        the Court of Appeal state should be considered in an appeal of this
        nature were considered by the  Judge.  Having  found  that  it  was
        undesirable for the appellant to have leave  to  remain  the  Judge
        considered  whether  there  were  factors   that   outweighed   the
        presumption that leave should for that reason be refused within the
        Article 8 assessment and at [154] of the decision under  challenge.
        The Judge, arguably, did exactly as the Court of Appeal require  in
        a case of this nature albeit in a slightly different format.
    49. From the findings made, when applying the structure of the decision
        required following the Court of Appeal judgement, I  find  that  no
        arguable legal error material to the decision to dismiss the appeal
        on all grounds has been made out as the decision  would  have  been
        the same.
    50. This is an appeal that differs from many in which there  was  clear
        evidence  before  the  Judge  of  duplicity  of  documentation  for
        different purposes and deliberate  attempts  by  the  appellant  to
        mislead HMRC even if it was properly  found  that  the  information
        provided to UKVI in support of earlier applications was  not  shown
        to be infected by  dishonesty.  The  Judge's  conclusion  paragraph
        322(5) had been made out by the respondent and that the decision is
        proportionate is clearly within the range of findings open  to  the
        Judge on the evidence.
