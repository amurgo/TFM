Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Subbarayan, instructed by Sivaramen Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellants

 1. This is an application, with permission, to appeal against the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal which refused  the  appeal  both  under  the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds, against the decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer.  The  appellants  had  applied  for  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as the adult dependent relatives  under
    Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  their  applications  were
    considered under paragraph EC-DR.1.1 of Appendix FM and refused on 24th
    February 2014.

 2. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan born on 6th September 1979  and
    1st January 1946 and are daughter and mother.  Their sponsor  Mr  Symon
    Rasheed is the brother of the first appellant and the son of the second
    appellant.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer considered the medical  evidence  available
    with respect to the first appellant and determined that  the  long-term
    care required by the first appellant was  available  in  Pakistan.   In
    relation to the  second  appellant  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had
    considered the assertion she was unable to provide care for  the  first
    appellant but  determined  that  she  had  not  demonstrated  that  she
    required long-term personal care  to  perform  everyday  tasks.   Those
    decisions  were  reviewed  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  who  was
    satisfied that there was no new evidence presented  and  the  treatment
    required by the first appellant was available in Pakistan.

 4. An application for permission to appeal in the first  instance  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal was  refused  on  the  grounds  that  the  decision
    constituted no more than a disagreement with the judge's findings which
    were open to him.

 5. The application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal on the  grounds  that
    the Home Office IDI had not been adhered to and that the  judge  failed
    to make any reasoning and failed to apply the Home Office policy  which
    was an error of law.   The  judge  failed  to  apply  E-ECDR.2.5(a)  of
    Appendix FM and this was an error of law.  The  judge  appeared  to  be
    saying that despite their illness and old age they  could  travel  over
    150 miles to seek treatment on their own on a regular  basis  and  this
    was not reasonable.  It was also asserted with reference to  Article  8
    that Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11 was not given  any  consideration  and
    this was an error.

 6. It was submitted that the sponsor was the only person providing for the
    appellants and there was no-one else as the sister lived some 140 miles
    away from the appellants.  It was not possible for her  to  assist  the
    appellants who need to attend the rheumatology department which is  150
    miles away.  For cultural reasons the appellants could  not  live  with
    the sponsor's sister, and although  the  judge  acknowledged  the  Home
    Office Guidance on Elderly  Dependant  Relatives  at  paragraph  2.2.3,
    which indicates how to interpret "no person  in  the  country  who  can
    reasonably provide care" he failed to take this into account.  He  also
    failed, it was asserted to take into account the distance between where
    the sponsor's sister lived and the appellants lived.

 7. The evidence provided was not disputed as incorrect and that the letter
    from the rheumatologist confirmed that the  appellant  had  missed  her
    appointment and there was evidence to show that the sponsor  had  taken
    unauthorised leave to care for the appellants in Pakistan.

 8. There was no-one who could reasonably provide  the  required  level  of
    care and the judge had not applied IDI paragraph 2.2.3 and thus  failed
    to interpret and apply the Section E-ECDR.2.5.  The issue was not  that
    no person in  Pakistan  who  could  provide  the  care  but  who  could
    reasonably provide it.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by the  Upper  Tribunal  which  merely
    stated that the grounds were arguable.

10. At the hearing before me I was provided with a copy of the Home  Office
    guidance and Mr Subbarayan confirmed that the sponsor had sent money to
    support the care of the mother and sister in Pakistan.

11. I asked him to point me to the evidence in relation to the  mother  who
    was now 68 years old but it appeared that the medical evidence provided
    was in relation to the sister.  There was little evidence  provided  in
    relation to the mother.  The medical evidence of Dr  Aziz  referred  to
    the condition of the sister and Mr Subbarayan underlined the point that
    the first appellant was expected to travel 140 miles for her  treatment
    and the letter was evidence that she had missed those appointments.

12. When asked about the cultural aspects, Mr Subbarayan pointed  out  that
    the sponsor who was the male of the family had  the  responsibility  to
    take care of his mother and sister as the  other  sister  was  married.
    Even with the sending of money it was difficult and not  practical  for
    the appellants to care for themselves in  Pakistan.   The  sponsor  has
    nearly lost his job whilst trying to care for them.

13. Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted that the  judge  had  recorded  all  the
    evidence and recorded the  issues  of  cultural  factors  at  [22]  and
    recorded the medical evidence.  The treatment was in place and care was
    not limited to family members.  The judge had followed the guidance and
    the decision disclosed no error of law.

14. The Immigration Rules in  relation  to  entry  clearance  of  an  adult
    dependent relative are set out at Appendix FM E-ECDR of the Immigration
    Rules.  In particular the requirements include ECDR.2.4 and ECDR.2.5:

    'E-ECDR.2.4.  The applicant or, if the applicant and their partner  are
                  the sponsor's parents  or  grandparents,  the  applicant's
                  partner, must as a result of age,  illness  or  disability
                  require long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks.



    E-ECDR.2.5.   The applicant, or if the applicant and their partner  are
                  the sponsor's parents  or  grandparents,  the  applicant's
                  partner, must be  unable,  even  with  the  practical  and
                  financial help of the  sponsor,  to  obtain  the  required
                  level of care  in  the  country  where  they  are  living,
                  because-

                  (a)  it is not available and there is no  person  in  that
                      country who can reasonably provide it; or;

                  (b)  it is not affordable'.

15. The Immigration Directorate Instructions in relation to family  members
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules effective from 13th December
    2012 sets out at 2.2.3 how the phrase "no person in the country who can
    reasonably provide care" should be interpreted.  This states:

         "The ECO should consider whether there is  anyone  in  the  country
         where the applicant  is  living  who  can  reasonably  provide  the
         required level of care.

         This can be a close family member:

           . son,

           . daughter,

           . brother,

           . sister,

           . parent,

           . grandchild,

           . grandparent

         Or  another  person  who  can  provide  care,   e.g.   home   help,
         housekeeper, nurse, carer or care or nursing home.

         If an applicant has more than one close  relative  in  the  country
         where they are living those relatives may be able to pull resources
         to provide the required care.

         The ECO should bear in mind any relevant cultural factors, such  as
         in countries where  women  are  unlikely  to  be  able  to  provide
         support."

16. On reading the decision of the First tier Tribunal I find the judge set
    out the evidence as given by the sponsor in his written  statement  and
    his evidence-in-chief and that the sponsor came to the UK in  2003  but
    returned to see the appellants in 2004, 2006, 2009 and most recently in
    2013.  The  first  appellant,  the  sponsor's  sister,  had  rheumatoid
    arthritis and had a deformed hand, knee joint, shoulder and  foot.   It
    was submitted that the mother was 67  years  old  and  had  no  problem
    looking after his sister until 2009 but since then  her  condition  had
    deteriorated.

17. At paragraph 10 the judge set out the evidence as follows:

         "10. His sister stopped receiving treatment for two  years  because
             where they lived there was no specialist medical  help  within
             150 miles.  In addition there was no-one available to take her
             to see the specialist.  Previously his mother  had  been  well
             enough before to take her for treatment  but  since  2009  his
             mother has not been able to take her to see the specialist.

         11.  The Sponsor stated that he has  two  sisters;  one  living  in
             Dubai and the other living in Rawalpindi which  is  140  miles
             from where his mother  lives.   The  Sponsor  stated  that  in
             Pakistan daughters cannot look after their mothers  once  they
             are married.  It is down to their husband's decision  if  they
             are able to look after their mother.   His  daughter  Rasheeda
             lives in Rawalpindi and her husband is not working.  His other
             daughter, Farida lives in Dubai.  The Sponsor has no  evidence
             to show their financial circumstances.

         13.  The Sponsor stated that he would be able to cover the cost  of
             the Appellants medical treatment for the next five years.   He
             stated that the medicines they need  are  not  expensive.   He
             stated that what they needed was daily care such  as  feeding,
             cleaning and clothing.  He says that his income is �38,000 per
             annum and his wife does not work.  He has provided  copies  of
             his bank statement and says that the balance is low because he
             has just had to pay for the repair of his boiler."

18. It was also clear that the judge recorded the  Immigration  Directorate
    Instructions at [22] of his decision and that he had noted the relevant
    provisions of those instructions.

19. The judge recorded that the appellants submit they had demonstrated how
    far they had to go to travel to get medical help in  Pakistan  and  the
    lack of specialists in rheumatology.

20. The judge found that he was satisfied that the appellants fulfilled the
    requirements of  paragraph  E-ECDR.2.4  in  that  they  faced  physical
    challenges to accomplishing everyday tasks as a result of their medical
    condition.  I find the judge was generous in  this  regard  bearing  in
    mind there was no specific medical evidence provided in relation to the
    second appellant, the mother, but there was clear medical  evidence  in
    relation to the first appellant.  That was provided by  way  of  letter
    dated 9th September 2013 in relation to Miss Akhtar but as pointed  out
    "her  disease  seems  to  be  reasonably  controlled  with   the   10mg
    prednisolone".

21. The conclusions and findings of the judge are essentially at  paragraph
    32 where he stated the following:

         "32. The Sponsor has arranged for the Appellants to receive care in
             their home in relation to cooking, cleaning and  clothing.   I
             have received no evidence to satisfy me that care in the  home
             is not available to the Appellants funded by the  Sponsor.   I
             have noted  concerns  regarding  the  honesty  of  the  person
             providing the home help but that is a matter to  be  addressed
             by changing the person providing the care.  I have  noted  and
             accept the there is a shortage of rheumatologists in  Pakistan
             and that the nearest specialist  medical  care  is  140  miles
             away.  However, I have no evidence as  to  how  often  such  a
             specialist needs to be visited.  I have no evidence to suggest
             that  the  medications  needed  by  the  Appellants  are   not
             available to them."

22. It is clear that the judge accepted that the sponsor had  arranged  for
    the appellants to receive care in their home in  relation  to  cooking,
    cleaning and clothing, and he had received no evidence to  satisfy  him
    that care in the home was not available as funded by the  sponsor.   It
    was not that the judge was expecting the appellants to be cared for  by
    any other family member and to that end  I  cannot  see  that  cultural
    factors are relevant because it  was  the  appellants'  case  that  the
    sponsor had been funding them financially and as a male he  was  indeed
    funding the appellants.  The judge was not expecting the  other  sister
    to step in to assist.

23. The judge had recorded that he accepted that there was  a  shortage  of
    rheumatologists in Pakistan and the nearest specialist medical care was
    140 miles away but as he stated there was no evidence as to  how  often
    such a specialist needed to be visited and it is clear from the  letter
    produced that this was not confirmed  and  there  was  no  evidence  to
    suggest  that  the  medications  needed  by  the  appellants  were  not
    available to them.  In the absence of  further  more  detailed  medical
    evidence or, , the judge was not satisfied that  they  were  unable  to
    obtain the required level of care in the country where they are  living
    because it was not available and there was no person  in  that  country
    who could reasonably provide it.

24. I am not persuaded that  the  judge  approached  the  consideration  of
    "reasonably" without considering the IDIs or the Immigration Rules.  It
    is clear that he did not expect the relatives to undertake the physical
    care which was required and indeed he  confirmed  that  if  there  were
    concerns regarding the honesty of the person providing the  home  help,
    that they could change the person  providing  the  care.   Nor  did  he
    ignore the distance to be travelled but  was  not  persuaded  that  the
    medications needed by the appellants were not available.  As  I  stated
    there was no medical evidence in relation to the mother and  the  judge
    clearly found no evidence of the regularity required for the visits  to
    the specialists or that they could not be afforded help  and  no  doubt
    this would include a driver to the relevant hospital for  appointments.
    The Guidance specifically refers to relatives 'Or  another  person  who
    can provide care, e.g. home help, housekeeper, nurse, carer or care  or
    nursing home'.  There is no reason  to  suppose  that  this  could  not
    include a driver and or escort but  as  the  judge  specifically  notes
    there was an absence even of the details of such specialist visits.

25. The judge did note the decisions of AE (Algeria) v   SSHD  [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 653 and GS (India) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 40 and elaborated on  the
    principles enunciated in those cases such that the fact that the  level
    of care available in the UK is higher  than  that  in  the  country  of
    residence is not evidence that the care available in  that  country  is
    insufficient.   Indeed, Paragraph 13 confirmed that the  sponsor  would
    be able to cover the costs of the appellants' medical treatment for the
    next five years and that "he stated that the medicines  they  need  are
    not expensive.  He stated that what they needed was daily care such  as
    feeding, cleaning and clothing" [my emphasis].  The judge recorded that
    "the Sponsor confirms that he  pays  for  someone  to  look  after  the
    appellants as he currently has no other choice" (paragraph  26).   This
    was not a recording of evidence that the appellants  were  in  want  of
    travel arrangements to the hospital.

26. There was little medical evidence in relation to  the  first  appellant
    and no medical evidence in relation to  the  second  appellant  and  in
    effect the judge found that the appellants had not made out their case.
      In the light of the above I am not persuaded that there is  an  error
    in  this  decision  and  that  the  judge  has  failed  to  follow  the
    Immigration Rules or the guidance.  The judge  simply  found  that  the
    appellants had not made  out  that  they  were  unable  to  obtain  the
    required level of care because 'it is not available  and  there  is  no
    person in that country who can reasonably provide it'.

27. I find no error of law and the application for permission to appeal  is
    merely a disagreement with the findings of the judge.

No anonymity direction is made.
