               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Ms O L Osagie appeared in person.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. These appeals and the family's immigration history have a  procedurally
    complex background; nevertheless the  present  position  is  relatively
    simple.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Cohen determined on 20  April  2016
    an appeal by a mother and her children.  The  decisions  against  which
    the appeal was brought were a decision to deport the first appellant on
    conducive grounds, and decisions to deport other appellants as  members
    of her family.

 2. Judge Cohen determined first that the principal decision against  which
    the appeals  were  brought  was  a  decision  which  was  made  not  in
    accordance with the law.  He also decided, on the basis of the  grounds
    produced before him, that the appellants were entitled under article  8
    as embodied in s. 117B of the 2002 Act (as amended) to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom; he therefore allowed the appeal on both  grounds.   The
    Secretary of State for the Home Department sought permission to  appeal
    solely on the ground that having determined that decision against which
    the appeal was brought was not in accordance with the  law,  the  judge
    ought not to have considered the article 8 grounds.

 3. Permission was granted and so the matter comes before  us.   Before  us
    today, Mr Avery has accepted that the ground put by  the  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department, although possibly  correct  in  essence,
    was bad in practice, because the decision against which the appeal  was
    brought was not erroneous in law  for  the  reason  identified  by  the
    judge.  He therefore does not pursue the appeal on that ground.   There
    is, however, no other ground as Mr Avery frankly accepts: the Secretary
    of State for the Home  Department  did  not  challenge  the  article  8
    decision in the present case.

 4. In those circumstances we have no difficulty in reaching our  decision,
    which is to dismiss the Secretary of State's  appeal,  and  it  follows
    that the decision of Judge Cohen stands.
