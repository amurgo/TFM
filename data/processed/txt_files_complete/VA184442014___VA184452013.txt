                                                                   Claimants


Representation:
For the claimants:     Mr T Gainsford, instructed by Charles Simmons
Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, Ataur Rahman, date of birth 10.2.57, and  his,  daughter
    Famita Akter, date of birth 3.4.91, are citizens of Bangladesh.

 2. This  is  the  appeal  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  against  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Callender Smith, promulgated
    5.9.14 allowing on human rights grounds the appeals  of  the  claimants
    against the decisions of the respondent, dated 15.9.13, to refuse entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as visitors pursuant to paragraph 41 of
    the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the linked appeals on 2.9.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Andrew  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    21.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge  Callender  Smith  should  be  set
    aside.

 6. As this was a decision made after June  2013,  there  is  no  right  of
    appeal on  immigration  grounds.  However,  the  grounds  raised  human
    rights, which does entitle the claimant to a right of appeal.

 7. In summary, the sole ground of appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer is
    that pursuant to  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT  00640  (IAC),  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should not have proceeded to  carry  out  an  article  8  ECHR
    assessment of private and family life without finding that  there  were
    compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised  in  the  Rules  for
    doing so  and  justifying,  exceptionally,  granting  leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules on the basis  that  the  decision  was  unjustifiably
    harsh.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it was arguable that
    the judge did not  give  proper  consideration  to  article  8  and  in
    particular did not identify compelling or exceptional circumstances.

 9. I find that the First-tier Tribunal judge was correct to observe at �21
    that human rights grounds were pleaded in the grounds of appeal and not
    simply limited to grounds  referred  to  in  section  84(1)(c)  of  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge is required  in  accordance  with  section  86  of  that  Act  to
    determine the appeal on the grounds put forward. To do otherwise  would
    be a breach of a statutory  requirement.  A  failure  to  consider  the
    article 8 claim would be likely to render  the  decision  non-compliant
    with section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

10. The Entry Clearance Officer might have  challenged  the  basis  of  the
    proportionality decision, but that was not raised as a ground of appeal
    and there was no application to amend the grounds of appeal.

11. At �22 the judge made a peculiar finding that the decision of the Entry
    Clearance Officer was neither lawful nor proportionate  by  failing  to
    consider the article 8 claim. If the judge considered that the decision
    was not in accordance with the law, the  correct  approach  would  have
    been to allow the appeal to the limited extent that it remains for  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to make a decision that is in  accordance  with
    the law. However, no complaint has been made about  this  part  of  the
    decision. In any event, it is open to the First-tier Tribunal Judge  to
    apply the correct law, even if the Entry Clearance Officer did  not  do
    so.

12. In the circumstances there is no merit in the grounds of appeal.

Conclusion & Decision:

13. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each claimant remains allowed on human  rights
                    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee award was made in the First-tier Tribunal and the  situation
has not changed.
