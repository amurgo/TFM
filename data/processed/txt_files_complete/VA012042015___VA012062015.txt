Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   No representative and no appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer appeals against a decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Anthony) allowing the respondents' appeals against
    decisions taken on  28  January  2015  refusing  to  grant  them  entry
    clearance to visit their son and daughter-in-law in the UK  under  para
    41 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 2. For convenience, I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellants are citizens of Syria and are a  married  couple.   They
    were born respectively on 26 May 1956 and 1 January 1939.

 4. On 21 January 2015, they each applied for entry clearance in  order  to
    visit their son and daughter-in-law in the UK.  The  purpose  of  their
    visit, as set out in their respective applications, was to come to  the
    UK as their son and daughter-in-law were expecting  their  first  child
    (the appellants' grandchild).  The baby was due on 17 February 2015 and
    the appellants wished to travel to the UK on that date and indicated in
    their application that they intended to stay for two months.

 5. At the date of the applications, the appellants were  resident  in  the
    United Arab Emirates (UAE).  They both indicated in  their  application
    form that they had a "residency visa" in the UAE.  Together with  their
    applications, the appellants submitted a number of documents (either to
    the ECO or subsequently to the ECM) including ones relating to property
    ownership in Syria, bank statements of the second  appellant  in  Syria
    and bank statements and other supporting documents from their  son,  Dr
    Imad Najm who is a Syrian national but working as a doctor in the UK.

 6.  On  28  January  2015,  the  ECO  refused  each  of  the   appellants'
    applications for entry clearance.  The ECO refused  their  applications
    under para 41(i) and (ii) of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as  amended)
    on the basis that he was not satisfied that they were genuine  visitors
    and that they intended to leave the UK at the end of their visit.

 7. In  relation  to  the  second  appellant  (the  husband  of  the  first
    appellant) the ECO's reasons were as follows:

         "The Decision

           . The onus is on you to qualify for  entry  clearance  based  on
             your own circumstances and your own intentions.  You have said
             that your son will help you with this visit by paying for your
             maintenance and accommodation whilst you  are  in  the  United
             Kingdom and I am satisfied that he is in a position to do  so.
             But whilst I take that into account in assessing your proposed
             maintenance and accommodation in the  UK,  that  is  only  one
             aspect of the visitor rules  and  this  sponsorship  does  not
             satisfy me of your own intention to leave the UK on completion
             of your visit.

           . On your application form you state that you  are  retired  and
             that you receive income from Properties and rental and  public
             funds or benefits.  However you  have  chosen  to  provide  no
             evidence of this income.  You have provided bank statements in
             your name, however it is unclear as to where the funds in this
             account have originated from.  I am therefore  unclear  as  to
             how you are supported in  the  UAE  at  this  time.   It  also
             appears that you  are  travelling  with  your  sole  dependent
             family member  your  wife  to  the  UK,  I  am  therefore  not
             satisfied that you have demonstrated that you have  sufficient
             ties to the UAE or Syria at this time.

           . Given all of this I am not satisfied that  your  circumstances
             in the UAE are as you have stated which also leads me to doubt
             your intentions in wishing to travel  to  the  United  Kingdom
             now.  As a result I am not satisfied that  you  are  genuinely
             seeking entry as a general visitor or that you intend to leave
             the United Kingdom at the end of the period of  the  visit  as
             stated by you.  41(i)(ii)

         I  have  therefore  refused  your  application  because  I  am  not
         satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that you meet  all  the
         requirements of the relevant Paragraph(s)  of  the  United  Kingdom
         Immigration Rules."

 8. The reasons for the refusal in respect  of  the  first  appellant  (the
    second appellant's wife) closely mirror those reasons.

 9. On 16  April  2015,  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  upheld  the  ECO's
    decisions.

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

10. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  Their appeals were
    limited to human rights grounds, in particular Art 8 of the ECHR.

11. The appellants did not seek  an  oral  hearing  and  so  Judge  Anthony
    determined their appeals on the papers.

12. First, Judge Anthony accepted that the appellants met the  requirements
    of para 41 as visitors but that this was only relevant in  the  context
    of Art 8 given the limited right of appeal.  Consequently he went on to
    consider their appeals under Art 8.

13. Secondly,  the judge found that in seeking to visit the  UK  to  attend
    the birth of their first grandchild,  the  appellants  had  established
    that their circumstances fell within Art 8(1) as constituting "a matter
    of private and family life" (see para 12).

14. Thirdly, the judge found that the ECO's decision would  interfere  with
    the "family and private life rights of the appellants, their son, their
    daughter-in-law and their grandchild" (see para 13).

15. Fourthly, the judge found that the interference would be in  accordance
    with the law (see para 14).

16. Fifthly, the judge noted that the ECO's decision did  not  invoke  "any
    legitimate aim" (see para 15).

17. Sixthly, the judge went on  to  consider  the  proportionality  of  the
    interference with the appellants' private and family life.

18.  He  found  the  respondents  decisions  to   be   a   disproportionate
    interference with the appellants' private and family life.  At paras 17-
    21 he said this:

         "17.     Before I go on to consider the above question, I have  had
             regard to part 5A  (Public  Interest  Considerations)  of  the
             Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (as  amended  by
             s.19 of the Immigration Act 2014).  I have taken into  account
             the public interest  considerations.   I  recognise  that  the
             public interest in the maintenance of firm immigration control
             is  engaged  and  I  acknowledge  that  this   has   statutory
             endorsement by virtue  of  s.117B(1)  of  the  2002  Act.   As
             regards the other provisions of s.117B, the ECO expressed  his
             satisfaction that the appellants' son would be able to provide
             them with maintenance and accommodation  during  their  visit.
             Thus the public  interest  expressed  in  s.117B(3)  does  not
             arise.  None of the other s.117B considerations arises.

         18.  Given that the public interest  in  the  maintenance  of  firm
             immigration control is  engaged,  the  final  question  to  be
             addressed  is   that   of   proportionality.    This   invites
             consideration of,  firstly,  the  extent  and  impact  of  the
             interference with the private and family life  rights  of  the
             appellants and the sponsor and his family  occasioned  by  the
             ECOs refusal decisions.

         19.  I consider that the interference is substantial and  profound,
             given that there is no other way in which the  avowed  purpose
             of supporting the sponsor and his wife during the delivery  of
             their first child and in the period thereafter can be achieved
             and the plans and  intentions  of  the  appellants  have  been
             thwarted outright.  I further consider that what  is  proposed
             by the appellants, in conjunction with the  others  concerned,
             is a matter of substantial importance to them.

         20.  I further take into account that the proposed sojourn  of  the
             appellants in the UK will be for a modest and  finite  period.
             The final factor to  be  considered  is  that  what  they  are
             proposing cannot be achieved in any other way.   I  have  also
             taken into account their extensive travel history as  set  out
             in the VAF.  I find that  the  appellants  have  had  previous
             visits to the UK and have left.  Applying Mostafa, I find that
             this is a weighty factor to be considered.  On these facts and
             given these considerations, the public interest in maintaining
             firm  immigration  control  is  less  potent  than  in   other
             contexts.  Balancing the  public  interest  with  the  various
             facts and considerations highlighted above,  I  conclude  that
             the   impugned   decisions   represent   a    disproportionate
             interference with the right to respect for  both  private  and
             family life enjoyed by the appellants  and  the  other  family
             members in the UK.

         21.  It  follows  that  a  breach  of  article  8  is  established.
             Accordingly, the appeal succeeds."

19. Consequently, the judge allowed the appellants' appeals under Art 8.

The ECO's Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

20. The ECO sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  He  did  so
    on essentially three grounds.

21. First, the judge, in finding that the appellants met  the  requirements
    of para 41, had failed to take into account the deteriorating situation
    in Syria since their last visit and, despite having complied  with  the
    terms of their visas in the  past,  the  judge's  conclusion  that  the
    appellants had demonstrated their intention to return was flawed.

22. Secondly, the judge had erred in law, applying the relevant  case  law,
    in finding that the appellants had established family life  with  their
    adult relatives in the UK.

23. Thirdly, in assessing proportionality the judge had failed  to  explain
    why the refusal of a visa which only allowed  the  appellants  to  join
    their family temporarily was a disproportionate interference with their
    Art 8 rights.

24. On 29 January 2016, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fisher) granted  the
    ECO permission to appeal.

25. Thus, the appeal came before me.

The Hearing

26. Despite having been sent  notice  of  the  hearing,  the  sponsor  (the
    appellants'  son)  did  not  attend  the  hearing.   Mr  Richards,  who
    represented the ECO invited me to hear the appeal in the absence of the
    appellants and sponsor.

27. Applying rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008
    (SI 2008/2698 as amended), I was satisfied that notice of  the  hearing
    had been sent to the appellants and sponsor and  that  it  was  in  the
    interest of justice to proceed with the  hearing.   I  noted  that  the
    original appeal had been, at the appellants' request, determined on the
    papers.

28. Mr Richards submitted that the judge's decision was flawed by  material
    errors of law.  He relied on the grounds which he supplemented  in  his
    oral submissions.

29. First, Mr Richards relied upon the grounds which criticised  the  judge
    for not considering the current situation in Syria in assessing whether
    the appellants were genuine visitors.

30. Secondly, Mr Richards submitted that in finding that the appellants met
    the requirements of para 41 (as part of  his  reasoning  in  finding  a
    breach of Art 8) the judge had failed to deal with the  ECO's  reasons,
    in particular that the appellants had not established on the  basis  of
    the submitted material that they intended to return to Syria at the end
    of their visit.  Mr Richards submitted that the judge had  not  engaged
    with the  financial  and  other  documents  which  the  ECO  considered
    insufficient to establish the appellants' ties with the  UAE  or  Syria
    and had merely relied upon the fact  that  they  had  left  the  UK  on
    previous visits.

31. Thirdly Mr Richards submitted, the judge had failed properly  to  apply
    case law such as Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ  31  and  Ghising  and
    Others [2013] UKUT 00567 (IAC) in concluding that  the  appellants  had
    family life with their adult family in the UK.

32. Fourthly, Mr Richards submitted that the judge was wrong in para 20  to
    conclude that  the  public  interest  was  "less  potent"  because  the
    appellants, on the judge's view, met the requirements of para 41 of the
    Immigration Rules.

33. Fifthly, relying on the grounds, Mr Richards submitted that the judge's
    finding that any interference with the appellants' private  and  family
    life was disproportionate was flawed.

34. Mr Richards invited me to find that there was a material error  of  law
    and to remake the decisions dismissing each of the appellants' appeals.



Discussion

35. Let me deal first with an  initial  point  raised  in  respect  of  the
    Judge's finding that the appellants met the requirements of para 41  as
    visitors.

36. As I have already indicated, the appellants could only appeal on  human
    rights grounds, in this context, under Art 8.  The  judge  was  clearly
    aware that the appellants had no appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The Judge was, nevertheless, correct to consider whether the appellants
    met the requirements of para 41 at the date of decision in applying Art
    8.

37. Whether the appellants met the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
    was relevant in assessing the proportionality of  the  ECO's  decisions
    providing they could establish an interference with their  private  and
    family life.

38. On the basis that they did, the judge correctly cited the  decision  of
    the Upper Tribunal (McCloskey J and UTJ Perkins) in Mostafa (Article  8
    in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC) where,  summarised  in  the
    head note, it is stated:

         "In the case of appeals brought against refusal of entry  clearance
         under Article  8  ECHR,  the  claimant's  ability  to  satisfy  the
         Immigration Rules is not the  question  to  be  determined  by  the
         Tribunal, but is capable and  weighty,  though  not  determinative,
         factor when deciding whether such refusal is proportionate  to  the
         legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control."

39.  The  relevance  of  individuals  meeting  the  requirements   of   the
    Immigration Rule was subsequently affirmed by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Kaur (visit appeals; Article 8) [2015] UKUT 487 (IAC) (UTJ  Storey  and
    DUTJ Bagral).  There, the UT noted, as set out in the head note, that:

         "The starting-point for deciding [whether a breach of Article 8  is
         established]  must  be  the  state  of  the  evidence   about   the
         appellant's ability to meet the requirements at paragraph 41 of the
         Immigration Rules."

40. However, the Upper Tribunal went on to state:

         "Unless an appellant can show that there are  individual  interests
         at stake covered by Article 8 'of a particularly  pressing  nature'
         so as to give rise to a 'strong claim that compelling circumstances
         may exist to justify the grant of LTE (leave to enter) outside  the
         Rules': (See SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at [40] and [50] he  or
         she is exceedingly unlikely to succeed.  That proposition must also
         hold good in visitor appeals."

41. There was, therefore, nothing wrong in the judge once  he  reached  the
    issue of proportionality in stating, in effect,  that  the  appellants'
    ability to satisfy the requirements of the visitor rules was a "weighty
    factor" (at para 9 of his determination).  The judge cited  Mostafa  at
    para 9, as he did in  para  20  when  he  stated  that:  "T[t]e  public
    interest in maintaining firm immigration control is less potent than in
    other context".  Despite Mr Richards' submission, that statement  seems
    to me to be no more than a reflection  of  the  "weighty"  factor  that
    flowed from the judge's finding the appellants met the requirements  of
    the visitor rule.

42. Thereafter, the crucial questions are:

    (1)  Did the judge err in law in concluding that the appellants met the
         requirements of the Immigration Rules?; and

    (2)  In applying Art 8 did he wrongly  find  that  their  "private  and
         family life" was engaged and interfered with for  the  purposes  of
         Art 8?

43. As regards the Immigration Rules,  the  relevant  provisions  (at  that
    time) were in para 41 of the Rules which provided as follows:

         "The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter  the
         United Kingdom as a general visitor are that he:

         (i)  is genuinely seeking entry as a general visitor for a  limited
             period as stated by him, not exceeding six months ... ; and

         (ii)     intends to leave the United Kingdom  at  the  end  of  the
             period of the visit as stated by him; ..."

44. Turning to Mr Richards' first submission based upon  the  grounds:  the
    grounds criticise the judge for not taking into account the  fact  that
    in  Syria  the  situation  had  deteriorated  considerably  since   the
    appellants' last visit.  The implication  is,  I  apprehend,  that  the
    appellants were not seeking to enter as genuine visitors but rather  to
    escape the current upheaval in Syria.

45. The difficulty with the argument as put in the grounds  is  that  there
    was no evidence before the judge, presented  by  the  ECO,  as  to  the
    situation in Syria.  It was not a matter relied upon by the ECO or  the
    ECM.  It was not for the judge to  seek  out  evidence  to  support  an
    argument not even relied upon by the  ECO.   Although  the  appeal  was
    determined on the papers, it was  open  to  the  ECO  to  make  written
    submissions and, indeed, to request an oral hearing.  Neither  was,  as
    far as I can tell, pursued by the ECO.  I am not, therefore,  satisfied
    that the judge erred in  law  in  failing  to  take  into  account  the
    situation in Syria upon which he had no evidence and on which the Entry
    Clearance Officer's decisions do not rely.

46. In any event, the appellants were not living in  Syria.   The  evidence
    before the judge (and indeed the ECO)  was  that  the  appellants  were
    living in the  UAE  where  they  had  residency  visas.   They  gave  a
    residential address in the UAE although they did indicate that they had
    only lived at that address for  two  months.   There  was  no  evidence
    before the judge that the appellants could not continue to live in  the
    UAE if they came to the UK and, at the end of their visit, left the  UK
    in accordance with the conditions of their leave.  There  was  evidence
    that they each had a "residency visa".

47. Consequently, I reject the submission that the judge erred  in  law  in
    failing to consider the current situation  in  Syria  in  reaching  his
    positive findings.

48. Secondly, Mr Richards relied upon a matter not expressly raised in  the
    grounds.  I will nevertheless consider the  submission  as  put  by  Mr
    Richards arising, perhaps, obliquely from the challenge to the  judge's
    factual finding under the Rules.

49. The ECO and ECM were not satisfied that the documents submitted by  the
    appellants showed sufficient "ties" with Syria or the  UAE  to  satisfy
    the requirement that they were genuine visitors who intended  to  leave
    the UK at the end of the visit.

50. I accept that the judge  did  not  deal  with  the  ECO's  concerns  in
    relation to the bank statements and the source of funds in  the  second
    appellant's account which, the ECO stated,  the  source  of  which  was
    "unclear".  The ECO was also not satisfied as  to  how  the  appellants
    supported themselves in the UAE.

51. In the absence of an oral hearing, the  ECO's  case  before  the  judge
    should, in general, be taken as that set out in  the  refusal  decision
    supplemented by any further submission.  The Judge  should,  therefore,
    have addressed the reasons for the Entry Clearance  Officer's  refusal.
    However, that failure was not, in my judgment, material to the  Judge's
    ultimate finding.

52. There was evidence before the judge that the appellants were  supported
    in the UAE (where they were retired)  by  income  from  properties  and
    rents and public funds or benefits.  At question 71 of his application,
    the second appellant refers to a monthly income from the former of �460
    and in respect of the latter of �100.  The second appellant  also  says
    that his family members provide a monthly income  of  �150.   Contrary,
    therefore, to what was said by the ECO in his decisions the appellants'
    ability to support themselves  in  the  UAE  was  demonstrated  in  the
    evidence in their application.

53. Further, the  second  appellant's  bank  accounts  show  three  monthly
    payments into his account in a Syrian bank under the heading  "Interest
    Capitalization transactions" each payment in matched  by  a  debit  for
    "withholding tax".  These bank statements cover the period 29 June 2014
    until 31 December 2014 shortly before the applications were made on  21
    January 2015.

54. In my judgment,  the  ECO's  dissatisfaction  with  this  evidence  was
    unsubstantiated.  The second appellant's evidence about his income  was
    set out and the regularity of payments into his account (together  with
    tax deductions) offers  up  no  sinister  implication  that  these  are
    payments over a six month period designed to  bolster  the  appellants'
    appearance of having funds available to them.   I  should,  of  course,
    point out that the appellants' evidence was that their son  in  the  UK
    was paying for their trip to the UK.

55. There was, in truth, little if anything in the documents to  sustain  a
    doubt as to the credibility of the appellants.  In my judgment, had the
    judge considered this evidence  and  the  ECO  and  ECM's  reasons  for
    finding it unsatisfactory, he could only have come to  one  conclusion,
    namely that the  evidence  taken  as  a  whole  demonstrated  that  the
    appellants were financially able to support themselves currently in the
    UAE: a conclusion consistent with his finding that  they  were  genuine
    visitors.

56. In fact, of course, in accepting the  genuineness  of  the  appellants'
    visit to the UK the judge took into account their impeccable history of
    previous visits, namely complying with the requirements of their  leave
    and returning home at the end of the visit.  The appellants also had  a
    substantial record of travelling which is set out in their applications
    and which the judge was entitled to take into  account  in  reaching  a
    finding on whether they were genuine visitors who intended to leave the
    UK at the end of their visit.

57. Further, the purpose of their visit was entirely understandable.  Their
    son and daughter-in-law were shortly to have their  first  child  which
    was the appellants' grandchild.  There was nothing  more  natural  than
    them wishing to visit to support their son and daughter-in-law  at  the
    time of, and shortly after, the birth of their grandchild.

58. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the judge did not materially err
    in law in reaching his finding that the appellants met the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules.

59. For the avoidance of doubt, were I to remake the decision I would find,
    on a  balance  of  probabilities,  that  the  appellants  were  genuine
    visitors who intended to leave the UK at the end  of  their  period  of
    visit and that, therefore, they met the requirements of para 41.

60. The next issue is whether the judge was entitled to find that Art 8 was
    engaged on the basis of the private and family life of  the  appellants
    and their family in the UK.

61. Mr Richards argued that the judge was not entitled to make that finding
    as it had not been established that the relationship with their son and
    daughter-in-law in the UK was other than one of "normal emotional ties"
    and no element of dependency  beyond  that  normally  existing  between
    adult family members.

62. In reaching his finding, the judge referred to and  applied  the  Upper
    Tribunal's decision in Abbasi  and  Another  (Visits  -  Bereavement  -
    Article 8) [2015] UKUT 00463 (IAC) which stated that:

         "The first question for the tribunal is  whether  the  benefit,  or
         facility which the Secretary of State is requested to confer  -  in
         this case, an entry visa for the specific and time limited  purpose
         advanced  -  is  protected  by  Article  8.   If  this  yields   an
         affirmative answer, the second question  is  whether  the  impugned
         decision interferes with the claimant's right to respect to private
         and/or  family  life.   If   this   question   also   is   answered
         affirmatively, the enquiry then shifts to the territory of  Article
         8(2), raising  the  third  question,  namely  whether  any  of  the
         specified legitimate aims is engaged.  If this produces a  negative
         answer a breach of Article 8 is thereby established.  On the  other
         hand, if a legitimate aim is  identified,  the  fourth,  and  final
         question  to  be  addressed  is  whether  the  interference  is   a
         proportionate means of promoting the aim in  question.   It  is  in
         this context and at this stage that issues relating to  the  extent
         and impact of the interference will be considered in the  balancing
         exercise."

63. Having set out a decision of  the  Strasbourg  Court  noting  that  the
    existence of "family life" was essentially a question of fact depending
    upon the "real existence in practice of close family ties",  the  judge
    continued at para 12 as follows:

         "Firstly, applying the structured approach  as  set  out  above  in
         Abassi to the factual matrix, I consider that the benefit which the
         appellants are seeking of the respondent, that is a visit to the UK
         to  attend  the  birth  of  their  first  grandchild  does   indeed
         constitute a matter of private and family life protected by article
         8(1)."

64. Of course, the case of Abbasi was in  an  entirely  different  context.
    There, the intended visit was in order to mourn with family members the
    recent death of a close relative. Nevertheless,  the  approach  of  the
    Tribunal in Abbasi is informative.  In Abbasi, the  Tribunal  concluded
    that the purpose of  the  visit  in  that  case  engaged  Art  8(1)  as
    constituting "a matter of private and family life".   Just  as  matters
    relating to death,  burial  and  mourning  and  associated  rights  are
    capable of falling within Art 8 as an aspect of private and family life
    (if not the latter most certainly the former), so in my judgment is the
    provision of support by parents for their adult children at the time of
    the birth of their grandchildren which equally is  capable  of  falling
    within the protection of Art 8.1.  It reflects a  cultural  and  social
    norm of "family" which features widely throughout  the  world.   It  is
    important aspect of the role of families at one of the most vital times
    in many people's lives.  It is  at  least  and  aspect  of  the  family
    members' "private life".

65. In my judgment, the judge was entitled  to  find  that  the  appellants
    visit to the UK engaged Art 8 as  falling  within  a  matter  of  their
    private and family life protected by Art 8.1.

66. Before turning to the judge's consideration of proportionality, I  note
    what the judge said at para 15 that: "The impugned decisions of the ECO
    do not invoke any legitimate aim".  It is clear to me  what  the  judge
    meant here is that the  ECO  in  his  decisions  had  not  stated  what
    legitimate aim was in play.  The judge was not,  in  my  view,  stating
    that he (the judge) concluded that no legitimate aim was engaged.  That
    is clear from what he says at para 17 onwards of his determination (set
    out above)  where  he  recognises  that  the  public  interest  in  the
    maintenance of  firm  immigration  control  is  engaged  by  virtue  of
    s.117B(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

67. In assessing the proportionality of the decisions, the judge had  found
    that the appellants met the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    That was,  as  the  judge  correctly  stated,  a  "weighty  factor"  in
    assessing proportionality.  It was not,  however,  determinative.   The
    judge did not fall into the error of thinking it was.  In para 17, as I
    have set out above, he considered the application of s.117B of the 2002
    Act.  At paras 19 and 20, he  found  that  the  interference  with  the
    appellants' private and family  life  and  that  of  their  family  was
    "substantial and profound".  The  point  made  by  the  judge  was,  of
    course, that the purpose of the visit could not be achieved other  than
    by the appellants coming to the UK.   There  was  no  question  of  the
    appellants' son and daughter-in-law travelling to the UAE in  order  to
    give birth to the appellants' grandchild.  This was not  a  case  where
    the appellants wished to visit family  in  a  situation  where  it  was
    equally possible for the family in  the  UK  to  visit  the  appellants
    abroad.  The purpose of  the  visit  could  only  be  achieved  if  the
    appellants came to the UK.  That was a powerful factor, in the light of
    the appellants meeting the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  as
    visitors, in their favour.  The judge was entitled to conclude,  in  my
    judgment, that the  interference  was  disproportionate.   They  had  a
    strong claim of a pressing nature given the "substantial and  profound"
    interference with the private and family life  of  the  appellants  and
    their son and daughter-in-law.  The judge's finding was not  irrational
    or otherwise unsustainable in law.

68. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the judge was entitled  to  find
    that the ECO's decisions breached Art 8.

69. The unfortunate fact is, however, that it  is  now  May  2016  and  the
    appellants wished to visit the UK in February 2015 (over fifteen months
    ago) when their grandchild was due to be born.  Nevertheless, the judge
    was required (as am I) to consider the appellants'  appeal  as  at  the
    date of decision and,  for  the  reasons  I  have  given,  he  did  not
    materially err in law in allowing the appellants' appeals under  Art  8
    and those decisions stand.

70. Accordingly, the ECO's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

                                                                      Signed

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In allowing the appeals, the judge made whole fee awards in respect  of  the
two fees that were paid or were payable.  I see no reason to interfere  with
that decision which stands.
