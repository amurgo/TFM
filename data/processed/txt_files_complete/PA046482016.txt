                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     no appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The SSHD refused the appellant's protection claim for reasons given  in
    a decision dated 19 April 2016.

 2. FtT Judge David C Clapham SSC dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  by  a
    decision promulgated on 15 February 2017.

 3. The appellant's grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT  are  set  out  in  an
    application to the FtT dated 1 March 2017 and in an application made to
    the UT dated 19 June 2017.

 4. The UT granted permission by a decision dated 2 March 2018,  "in  light
    of the interlocutor of the Lord Ordinary".

 5. Notice of the hearing was issued on 28 August 2018 to the appellant and
    to her representatives.  Her representatives advised  on  12  September
    that they were no longer instructed. The appellant did not  appear  and
    was not represented at the hearing.  Neither the UT  had  received  any
    communication from her.  The hearing proceeded in her absence.

 6. Mr Govan conceded that the FtT's decision errs in law, in particular by
    taking the view that the FtT was not  concerned  with  the  trafficking
    claim, a process  which  the  appellant  alleged  to  have  started  in
    Vietnam, and that an entirely fresh hearing was required.

 7. It may be that the appellant has no further interest  in  pursuing  her
    appeal.  However, rather than proceeding  immediately  to  dismiss  it,
    that will be a matter for  the  FtT  to  consider,  taking  account  of
    whether she chooses to participate.

 8. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.  Under section 12 of  the  2002  Act  and
    Practice Statement 7.2 the case is remitted to the FtT for an  entirely
    fresh hearing.

 9. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Clapham.

10. The anonymity direction made by the FtT is maintained.
