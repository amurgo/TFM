Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Patel
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of India born on  13th  January  1986.   The
    Appellant had previously  entered  the  United  Kingdom  on  a  working
    holiday visa on 27th January 2008 and then left on 12th November  2009.
    He re-entered the United Kingdom on 4th July 2013  and  was  granted  a
    family visit visa which expired on 11th December 2013.   Prior  to  the
    expiry of his visit visa the Appellant  lodged  an  application  for  a
    residence card as the spouse of an EEA national on 28th October 2013.

 2. On 19th March 2014 the Appellant was served  with  notice  of  refusal.
    That notice of refusal acknowledged that the Appellant  had  married  a
    Csilla Jovanovics, a Hungarian national on 14th October  2013.   Notice
    of refusal was  issued  on  the  basis  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    considered that the timing of the Appellant's marriage as well  as  the
    fact that he provided no evidence  to  demonstrate  he  even  knew  his
    Sponsor prior to the marriage, raised concerns  regarding  whether  the
    marriage or relationship was genuine.

 3. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Simpson sitting at Manchester on 16th June  2014.   In  a
    determination promulgated on 15th September 2014 the Appellant's appeal
    was allowed under the Immigration Rules.  The  Secretary  of  State  on
    12th September 2014 lodged Grounds of Appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    The Grounds of Appeal noted that the judge had stated that she was  not
    satisfied that the EEA national was employed but did find that the  EEA
    national was a student  and  therefore  a  qualified  person.   It  was
    submitted that the judge had erred in this finding  because  in  cross-
    examination the EEA national had stated that she did  not  have  health
    insurance and therefore could not be considered as a  qualified  person
    because she did not meet the requirement of Regulation 4(d)(2)  of  the
    2006 EEA Regulations namely that she has comprehensive  sickness  cover
    in the United Kingdom.

 4. On 21st October 2014 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Froom  granted
    permission to appeal on that ground.  There is no Rule 24 response from
    the Appellant.

 5. It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether there is a material error of law in the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.  The Appellant appears by his instructed solicitor
    Mr Patel.  Mr Patel is familiar with this matter.  He  attended  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  The Secretary of State appears  by  her  Home
    Office Presenting Officer Mr McVeety.  I note that this is an appeal by
    the Secretary of State.  For the purpose of continuity  throughout  the
    appeal process the Secretary of State is  referred  to  herein  as  the
    Respondent and Mr Patel as the Appellant.

Submissions/Discussions

 6. Mr Patel accepts that there is an error of law in the determination  in
    that at paragraph 15 of the determination  as  there  is  no  reference
    therein to the Sponsor's medical insurance.  However  he  submits  that
    the case involved an EEA national who was employed and  undertaking  an
    ESOL course.  He points out that the Sponsor passed the course and that
    there is a  clear  record  of  the  Sponsor's  employment  history  and
    therefore she did not need medical insurance because of the  amount  of
    money that she was earning.  Mr McVeety acknowledges the  position  and
    does not seek to challenge it.

The Law

 7.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account   immaterial   consideration,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

 8. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

 9. The effect of the concessions made  by  Mr  Patel  on  the  Appellant's
    behalf and the agreement of Mr McVeety show that there was  a  material
    error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but  that
    ultimately the decision was the correct one albeit  that  it  could  be
    considered that it should be for different reasons.  I consequently set
    aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and for the sake of
    correctness remake the decision allowing the appeal.  I find  that  the
    Sponsor is not a student but an employee and  that  there  is  evidence
    that she is earning ï¿½700 a month from her  employers  Frenchbourne  and
    documentary evidence is provided from HM Revenue &  Customs  confirming
    information relating to her payment history.

10. The documentary evidence which is made available shows firstly that the
    Sponsor has been in employment since 9th September 2013  and  that  she
    has been exercising her treaty  rights  throughout  that  period.   The
    evidence produce includes her payslips, confirmation of employment from
    her employer, P60 and bank statement showing her  salary  credits.   In
    addition evidence is provided of private health cover.  Under the  2006
    Regulations the Sponsor  only  has  to  be  working  at  the  date  the
    application is considered.  In all circumstances this was an  Appellant
    therefore  who  met  the  requirements  of  the  2006  Regulations.   I
    consequently remake the decision allowing the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material error  of  law.
Whilst that decision is set aside the decision is remade still allowing  the
appeal for the  reasons  set  out  above  under  the  Immigration  (European
Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

No anonymity direction is made.
