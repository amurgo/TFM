                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Coutts promulgated on 25th June  2015,  following  a  hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on  22nd  May  2018.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Nigeria, and  was  born  on  20th
    October 1975.  He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    31st May 2017, refusing his application for a permanent residence card,
    as the husband and family member of an EEA national, namely, Ms [KH].

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim  is  that  the  Sponsor  has  been
    exercising treaty rights for the required period through a  combination
    of being employed, working as a receptionist  for  Anataliazeez  Allied
    and Venture and BD Financial Services, and also as a domestic  cleaner,
    on a self-employed basis.  He was able  to  produce  class  2  national
    insurance payment demands for the Sponsor which were receipted as  paid
    for periods from 9th October 2011 to 30th June  2012,  and  31st  March
    2013 to 5th October 2013.  He had produced pay slips  for  the  Sponsor
    for the period April 2013 to November 2013.  He had also  produced  pay
    slips for the following periods: May, September, November and  December
    2014;  and  May,  June,  July,  October  and  November  2015.   He  had
    furthermore produced the Sponsor's tax return for the year  ending  5th
    April 2016 which showed her being self-employed on earnings of  ï¿½8,320.
    In addition, he had produced a letter from HMRC confirming the  receipt
    of the Sponsor's tax return for the period 6th April 2016 to 5th  April
    2017.   In  the  circumstances  he  maintains  that  he  qualifies  for
    permanent residence.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed that the Sponsor had not attended court, although he
    would draw no adverse  inference  from  this.   Even  so,  if  she  had
    attended the hearing there would have been an  opportunity  to  discuss
    some of the inconsistencies in the presented case.  In particular there
    was the inconsistency in the Sponsor stating in her  witness  statement
    that she was employed as a receptionist for BD Financial Services,  and
    the fact that there were  no  pay  slips  produced  for  this  employer
    (paragraph 22).  Furthermore, the latest documentation produced, namely
    her P60 for the year ending 5th April 2018, showed her  to  be  working
    for Abbatt Property Services, but  there  was  no  mention  about  this
    employment in her witness statement or for  how  long  it  has  lasted.
    (Paragraph 23).  There was also some evidence of self-employment by the
    Sponsor in terms of her class 2 national  insurance  contributions  for
    periods in 2011, 2012, and 2013 and the self-assessment tax return  for
    the period for 6th April 2015 to 5th April 2016.  However,  there  were
    no further details  about  this  self-employment  (paragraph  24).   In
    addition, that as the Sponsor describes  her  other  work  as  being  a
    domestic cleaner, the tax return describes her self-employment as multi-
    trading (paragraph 24).  In the end, however,  there  were  only  eight
    months' pay slips produced for the year 2013, and four months  for  the
    year 2014, and five months for the year 2015, so that the Sponsor could
    not show working as a receptionist for Anataliazeez Allied and  Venture
    (paragraph 30).

 5. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the judge erred as a question  of
    fact  because  there  was  an  omission  (at  paragraph  22)   of   his
    determination to refer to the pay  slips  for  BD  Financial  Services,
    because these appear at pages 47  to  49  of  the  Appellant's  bundle.
    Second, the judge also erred (at paragraph 23) of his determination  in
    overlooking the fact that the Sponsor did produce a P60 for  5th  April
    2018, which did show her work with Abbatt  Property  Services.   Third,
    the judge erred also in not taking into consideration  the  Appellant's
    child's welfare  under  Section  55  of  the  BCIA  2009,  because  the
    Appellant was in a loving relationship with his daughter as her father.

 7. On 18th September  2018,  permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  the
    Tribunal on the basis that pages 47 to 49 of the Appellant's bundle  do
    show pay slips from BD Financial Services.  Moreover, paragraph  22  of
    the decision, refers to an inconsistency,  but  the  Sponsor  makes  it
    clear in her witness statement that she was employed as a  receptionist
    for BD Financial Services.

Submissions

 8. The Appellant appeared in person.  He  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    erred in law at paragraph 22 in stating that pay  slips  had  not  been
    produced for BD Financial Services when in fact they had  clearly  been
    produced at pages 47 to 49.  This meant that they had  not  been  taken
    into account.  The failure to take them into  account  was  a  material
    error.  In the same way, the judge questioned the fact that the Sponsor
    stated she worked as a domestic cleaner but her tax return  stated  she
    worked in multi-trading (paragraph 24), but her wage slips (at pages 47
    to 49) were not taken into account,  with  a  view  to  clarifying  the
    situation.

 9. For her part, Ms Kenny relied upon the fact that, given the totality of
    the evidence before the judge, and  the  number  of  unexplained  gaps,
    which would have been failed had the  Sponsor  only  attended  to  give
    evidence (see paragraphs 20 to 22) the judge was right to  conclude  as
    he did.  It must not be forgotten that the various forms of  employment
    by the Sponsor had not been all put to the judge in a  proper  way  and
    there were inconsistencies.

10. In reply, the Appellant submitted that he was not a lawyer, and he  had
    attended court to tell the truth, and as far as he  was  concerned  his
    wife had been working, and he had provided evidence to this effect.

Error of Law

11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.  The Appellant was issued with  a
    residence card on 13th October 2011, on the basis of  his  marriage  to
    the Sponsor, and this was extant until 13th October 2016.  There  is  a
    child of the marriage with the EU spouse who  was  born  on  28th  July
    2012.  When on 31st May 2017, the Appellant  applied  for  a  permanent
    residence card, this was refused on 25th  June  2018.   In  the  appeal
    before Judge Coutts, it is clear that all of the submitted evidence has
    not been taken into account.  In particular,  there  is  a  significant
    error (at paragraph 22) in the judge stating that the  Sponsoring  wife
    did not produce pay slips for BD Financial Services, when these  appear
    at pages 47, 48 and 49 of the Appellant's bundle.   In  the  same  way,
    such evidence as is produced, such as the P60 for year ending 5th April
    2018, showing the Sponsor to be working for Abbatt  Property  Services,
    is wrongly discounted on the basis that "there is no mention about this
    employment in  her  witness  statement  or  how  long  it  has  lasted"
    (paragraph 23).  Given that the  issue  was  whether  the  Sponsor  was
    exercising treaty rights as claimed, the oversight of such evidence  as
    was produced, amounts to an error of law.

Decision

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined  by  a  judge
    other than Judge Coutts  and  pursuant  to  Practice  Statement  7.2(b)
    because the nature or extent of  any  judicial  fact-finding  which  is
    necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be remade is  such
    that, having regard to the  overriding  objective  in  Rule  2,  it  is
    appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.  I note  that
    the Appellant, appearing in person before me, has stated in his grounds
    of application that this appeal should be allowed "on the basis of  the
    near miss of the Appellant's Sponsor not producing all but some of  the
    Sponsor's proof of exercising treaty rights",  but  this  is  the  very
    reason why it is not appropriate to allow the appeal.  It is  incumbent
    upon the Appellant to ensure that all the evidence is properly produced
    before the Tribunal, and where possible for the Sponsor to attend court
    to explain away any discrepancies, so that the  decision  maker  has  a
    full picture upon which to make findings of fact.

13.  This appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
