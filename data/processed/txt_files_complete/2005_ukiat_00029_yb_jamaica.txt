                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator (Mr  EH  Woodcraft),
   sitting at Bradford on 23 March 2004, dismissing  an  asylum  and  human
   rights appeal by a citizen of Jamaica, now 24. Permission to appeal  was
   given on the basis of a claim apparently suggesting that the adjudicator
   had refused to hear a witness for the claimant, a Mr Kamaley Clarke.

2. The relevant history of the case follows:

      08.03.2001  claimant given one month's leave to enter
      14.05.2002  arrested as overstayer and claims asylum
      18.06.2002  asylum refused and notice of removal directions given
      09.10.2002  first appeal to adjudicator heard
      02.12.2002  decision issued: dismissed
      14.02.2003  leave to appeal given
   18/27.02.2003 claimant commits four offences of supplying crack cocaine
      30.06.2003  convicted and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment
      17.07.2003  first appeal to Tribunal heard
      22.08.2003  decision issued: remitted for fresh hearing
      02.10.2003  notice of intention to deport (for public good)
      23.03.2004   second  appeal  to  adjudicator   heard   (against   both
           decisions)
      29.04.2004  decision issued: dismissed
3. It follows from the date of the  decision  now  under  appeal  that  this
   appeal can only succeed on a point of law: see CA [2004] EWCA  1165,  and
   the extended definition of "point of law" in E & R [2003] EWCA Civ 49. If
   the claim about refusing to hear the witness were made out, that would be
   one; and that is the main ground on which permission to appeal was given,
   some time before the decision in CA came out.  The  grant  of  permission
   also referred to two decisions on "issues relating to  a  sufficiency  of
   protection for homosexuals [the  claimant  is  a  Lesbian]  and  internal
   relocation in Jamaica"; but those were not relied on by the draftsman  of
   the grounds of appeal, and we see nothing either in the  grounds  or  the
   adjudicator's decision itself capable of raising  arguable error  of  law
   on  part, except for the claim about the witness.

4. That was the subject of a direction by Goldstein VP who  gave  permission
   to appeal, requiring either:

    . an affidavit or statement of truth by counsel (not Mr Lourdes,  but  a
      Mr Shamin) who had appeared  before  the  adjudicator,  attaching  any
      notes to support the account of what had happened; or

    . if the claim could not be made out, an affidavit or statement  by  the
      draftsman of the grounds of appeal, explaining how it came to be made.

   On 3 September 2004 the Tribunal  wrote  to  the  claimant's  solicitors,
   reminding them of the  directions:  on  14  September  they  wrote  back,
   explaining that counsel was unable to support the claim  which  had  been
   made, and the person who had made it did not work for them any  more.  On
   19  October  they  sent  in  a   statement   by   that   person,   a   Mr
       . He explained that he had not meant  to  make  any  claim  that  the
   adjudicator had refused to hear the  witness:  the  witness  had  arrived
   late, and, for whatever reason, it had been counsel who  decided  not  to
   call him. The writer said the point he had been trying to make was simply
   that hearing the oral evidence of Mr Clarke  would  have  resulted  in  a
   fairer decision by the adjudicator.

5. What the ground in question (� 13) had  actually  said  was  this:  "The
   hearing was unfair and so breached ECHR Article 6  because  the  crucial
   witness Mr Kamaley Clarke was not afforded the opportunity to give  oral
   evidence even though he attended the court." As  is  the  practice  when
   grounds  are  settled  by  solicitors,  they  were  not  signed  by  the
   draftsman: we are not surprized that Goldstein VP should have read  this
   one as a complaint against the adjudicator, as there could have been  no
   reasonable ground of appeal based on  anyone  else's  decision  that  Mr
   Clarke should not be called. We are however prepared to accept that this
   had not been Mr Domas-Pheghe's intention.

6. As Goldstein VP noted, the adjudicator recorded at � 15 that he was told
   by counsel that Mr Clarke had attended court late, and so could  not  be
   tendered for cross-examination: there had been a  written  statement  by
   him before the adjudicator.  The  adjudicator  in  his  observations  on
                    statement confirms this, and that he  would  of  course
   have been ready to hear the witness if he had been told he was there: he
   notes the absence of anything from Mr Shamin, counsel  before  him.  The
   presenting officer  (Miss  Donnelly)'s  file-note,  produced  before  us
   records that the claimant "... wanted to call her cousin [Mr Clarke] but
   he hadn't arrived by 12.45 when [she] had completed her  evidence."  She
   expressed surprize, not  unreasonably,  that  another  witness  (a  Miss
                         , the Lesbian partner of  the  claimant)  had  not
   been called.

7. Mr Lourdes told us that both Mr  Clarke  and  Miss                   who
   were present before us, said they had both been there  at  least  before
   the end of the hearing before the adjudicator: afterwards they had  been
   told by Mr Shamin that he had been unable (rather than unwilling to call
   them). Assuming that counsel did say something they understood  in  that
   way, his motives for doing so are not clear, and  for  all  we  know  he
   might have simply been trying to explain his own decision without  undue
   embarrassment. There is nothing to show that  either  of  them  had  any
   first-hand knowledge of what had gone on in the hearing room: it  is  of
   course the practice before adjudicators, as with  criminal  courts,  for
   witnesses, other than the subject of the case, to  remain  outside  till
   called. What is crystal  clear  is  that  the  adjudicator  himself  did
   nothing whatsoever to prevent either Mr Clarke  or  Miss          (about
   whose evidence there is in any case  no  complaint  in  the  grounds  of
   appeal) from being called before him.

8. It was the loosely-drafted grounds of Mr Paul             which  led  to
   the elaborate and expensive machinery of a second appeal  (in  fact  the
   fourth in this case) being brought into operation. We note that he is no
   longer working for these solicitors,  and  we  accept  that  he  had  no
   intention of deliberately misleading the Tribunal; but we  have  to  say
   that more care should be taken before putting  in  proposed  grounds  of
   appeal  which  could  be  read  as  a  serious  allegation  against  the
   adjudicator's conduct of the proceedings.

9. The following is the gist of  Ouseley P's note to vice-presidents of  23
   November 2004, suitably modified for the guidance  of  persons  advising
   claimants (or presenting officers)  where  such  allegations  are  being
   considered:

   If the allegation is very general, and more in the way  of  a  throwaway
   line, it is likely to be dealt with on the application for permission to
   appeal  as  wholly  unsubstantiated,  bearing  in  mind   the   inherent
   seriousness of such an allegation.

   If the allegation is more particularised in the grounds  of  appeal,  it
   may be treated as arguable.  "Particularised" means  not  only  that  it
   should have some detail to support the point, but it should be  apparent
   that the allegation is being  made  or  supported  by  someone  who  was
   arguably in a position to know what happened.  If that is not the  case,
   then the applicant can be said not to  have  shown  that  the  case  was
   reasonably arguable.

   This is not to say that the grounds should be accompanied by  a  witness
   statement, nor that if the grounds are signed by  someone  who  was  not
   there, that they must fail.  They must however go beyond a vague general
   assertion, and show  something  of  significance  which  the  party  was
   willing and able to support.  They  should also show that there was  the
   prospect of evidence being obtained for the appeal.


10. In the present case,  as  we  have  seen,  not  only  did  the  evidence
   eventually obtained show no misconduct whatsoever of the hearing by  the
   adjudicator; but that the grounds were  never  intended  to  claim  that
   there was in the first place.
