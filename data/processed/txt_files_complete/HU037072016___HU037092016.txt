Representation:

For the Appellant:             The appellant in person
For the Respondent:        Mr P Armstrong, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellants are mother and son born on 10 December 1965  and  13
         October 1998 and nationals of Nigeria. They challenge the  decision
         of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart to dismiss their  article
         8 appeals by way of a determination promulgated  on  24  May  2017.
         Since the determination was promulgated, the second  appellant  has
         been granted leave to remain on the basis of  having  resided  here
         for over 7 years. The challenge to the determination  is  therefore
         academic insofar as his immigration matter is  concerned.  However,
         there is no formal application to withdraw his case.


      2. The first appellant arrived here as a visitor on 23 March 2007. Her
         visa expired on 4 April 2008 and she  has  since  remained  without
         authority. The second appellant entered on 9  September  2007  with
         his father. He also overstayed the  conditions  of  his  leave.  An
         application to remain on article 8 grounds was made on 17  November
         2008. That  was  refused  on  5  May  2009.  Applications  for  the
         Secretary of State to reconsider her decision were made in December
         2010, April 2013 and May  2014;  all  unsuccessfully.  However,  in
         April 2015 following the filing of a judicial review claim  by  the
         appellants, the respondent agreed  to  reconsider  the  claims  and
         proposed a consent  order.  It  appears  that  there  was  previous
         judicial review litigation which led to reconsideration in 2013 but
         a further refusal thereafter.



      3. The judge considered the appeal under paragraph 276ADE, found  that
         the second appellant had not been in the UK for half his life as at
         the date of the application  or  decision  and  that  it  would  be
         reasonable for him  to  leave  the  UK.  She  considered  his  best
         interests and also considered the first  appellant's  circumstances
         and s.117B.  She concluded that both  appellants  could  return  to
         Nigeria.


      4. The appellants sought and obtained permission to appeal on 16  June
         2017 on the basis that the judge had arguably erred in  failing  to
         consider that the second appellant  met  the  requirements  of  the
         rules as at the date of the hearing and that he  had  been  granted
         leave to remain. Judge Holmes also  considered  that  arguably  the
         judge should have assessed the article 8 claim on  the  basis  that
         the second appellant was entitled to leave to remain.



         The hearing

      5. Both appellants attended the hearing before me on 14  August  2017,
         and I heard submissions  from  the  first  appellant  and  from  Mr
         Armstrong.  The appellant maintained that her son had been  granted
         leave to remain. She submitted that he had lived here over half his
         life and that they lived together  with  her  son  relying  on  her
         financially and emotionally. She stated that her  family  life  was
         outweighed by the public interest. She had served her sentence.  It
         would be difficult to return to Nigeria as she had no family there.
         She then admitted she had a mother,  a  brother  and  a  sister  in
         Nigeria but maintained they could not help her. She  did  not  have
         permission to work here but undertook some hair dressing  work  and
         sewing for which she was paid.


      6. In response Mr Armstrong submitted that permission  to  appeal  had
         been granted on post hearing evidence. The position at the date  of
         the hearing was that the second appellant did  not  have  leave  to
         remain and the judge was entitled to assess the article 8 claim  on
         the basis that he would leave the UK with his mother. The appellant
         had been  an  overstayer  for  some  9  ï¿½  years  and  was  working
         illegally. She had shown a propensity to  deceive  by  using  false
         documents. There was no evidence to show she could  not  return  to
         Nigeria and it was open to her son to go with her. She  had  family
         in Nigeria and previous experience of running a business there. Her
         son had been educated at public expense and they had  made  use  of
         NHS resources. The public interest required her removal. The  judge
         had applied the law correctly. Her determination was sustainable.

      7. Mrs Azeez replied. She acknowledged  that  Mr  Armstrong  had  made
         valid points but maintained that she could not return to Nigeria as
         she had nothing to return to.

      8. At the conclusion of the hearing, I reserved my determination which
         I now give.



    Conclusions



      9. The challenge to the  judge's  determination  has  focused  on  her
         treatment of the second appellant's claim.  The  criticism  of  the
         first appellant's appeal only bites if  the  complaints  about  the
         second appellant are made out because it is  not  argued  that  the
         first appellant's appeal has merit other than parasitic reliance on
         her son's case. Indeed, the appellant herself at the hearing before
         me, acknowledged in her submissions that it was her son's case that
         was the stronger of the two.


     10. The grant of leave to remain to the second appellant  is  a  matter
         which occurred after the hearing and so cannot be used to undermine
         the judge's determination. I have seen no evidence that there was a
         pending application for leave on the basis of 276ADE(v) at the time
         of the hearing  or  that  the  judge  was  informed  that  such  an
         application had been made (if it had). There is no reference to any
         such application or an intention to make one in any of the  witness
         statements or supporting evidence that was submitted.  Indeed,  the
         judge suggested in her determination (at paragraph 26) that it  was
         open to hi to make an application if he did not wish to leave.  The
         judge was, therefore, entitled to proceed on the basis that neither
         appellant had any basis to be  in  the  UK.  The  only  application
         before her was for a grant of  leave  on  article  8  grounds,  the
         refusal of which gave rise to this appeal.


     11. The judge was plainly aware  of  the  second  appellant's  age  and
         length of residence and the relevance of this to 276ADE (iv).  This
         is plain from paragraphs 1, 3, 6, 9, 14 and 19 where the matter  is
         discussed. The judge applied the facts to the rules  which  require
         an applicant to have spent over half his life here at the  date  of
         the application.   She correctly found that although  he  had  been
         here more than seven  years,  he  had  not,  at  the  date  of  the
         application leading to these proceedings, or even at  the  date  of
         the decision of 25 January 2016, been here more than half his  life
         although at the  date  the  respondent  agreed  to  reconsider  the
         article 8 application, he had been here over  7  years.  The  judge
         took that date as being the date of the consent  order  of  24  May
         2015, giving the second appellant generous extra time  to  qualify,
         albeit he could  not.  Correctly  applying  the  rules,  the  judge
         concluded that the second appellant did not  qualify  under  276ADE
         either under sub section (iv) or (v).

     12. In so far as the grounds rely on the respondent's policy  that  was
         not argued before the judge and a copy of the policy was  not  made
         available to her.


     13. The judge considered the best interests  of  the  second  appellant
         noting his bright prospects with the possibility of university (and
         I note his many other talents such as his dancing  abilities).  She
         took account of  relevant  case  law.  She  properly  assessed  the
         circumstances of both appellants. She did not accept that  she  had
         been told the truth about the appellants  having  no  contact  with
         their husband/father because the appellant had  been  dishonest  in
         the past and  had  been  evasive  at  the  hearing  when  answering
         questions. She noted that the appellants had skills and  that  they
         had family in Nigeria.  She  had  regard  to  the  public  interest
         factors of s.117B and was  entitled  to  conclude  that  given  the
         reasonableness  of  the  second  appellant's   return,   the   poor
         immigration  history  of  the  first  appellant,  her  deceit   and
         dishonesty in the past,  her  conviction  and  the  use  of  public
         resources, removal was proportionate. In view of the  circumstances
         applicable at the date of  the  hearing,  and  notwithstanding  the
         letters of support  which  speak  well  of  the  first  appellant's
         upbringing of her son  (something  of  which  she  should  be  very
         proud), the judge's approach was entirely open to her and no errors
         of law are apparent in her determination.


     14. Given the change of circumstances  since  the  hearing  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal, the appellants may have been better off making
         fresh  representations  to  the  Secretary  of  State  rather  than
         pursuing a challenge to this determination and  may  wish  to  seek
         legal advice on how best to proceed from here onwards.



    Decision


     15. The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  error  of  law  and  the
         determination stands. The appeals are dismissed.



    Anonymity



     16. There has been no request for an  anonymity  order  and  I  see  no
         reason to make one.
