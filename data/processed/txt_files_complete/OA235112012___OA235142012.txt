Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr M Goldborough, Solicitor, of Cleveland & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants are citizens of Jamaica, born respectively  on  15  July
    1998 and 1 September 1995.  They are half siblings and  the  biological
    children of the sponsor, Lisa Williams, a person present and settled in
    the United Kingdom.  In August 2012 they applied for entry clearance to
    the United Kingdom as dependants of the sponsor.  On  24  October  2012
    the respondent refused their applications.

2.   The appellants appealed against that decision and  on  27  August  2013
    their appeal was heard at Taylor House  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Elliman.  In a determination  promulgated  on  3  September  2013,  she
    allowed their appeals on human rights grounds (Article 8), having found
    that the appellants could not meet the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules;  namely,  that,   if   admitted,   the   appellants   could   be
    satisfactorily maintained, without recourse to public funds.

3.   The respondent was given permission to appeal Judge Elliman's  decision
    and on 22 November 2013 the appeal was heard in the Upper  Tribunal  by
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Wilson.  In a decision  dated  27  November
    2013, Deputy Judge Wilson found an error  of  law  in  Judge  Elliman's
    determination, as a result of which he  set  the  determination  aside.
    Deputy Judge Wilson's written reasons are set out in  the  Appendix  to
    this determination.

4.   In the event, illness has prevented Deputy Judge Wilson from  re-making
    the decisions in the  appellants'  appeals,  with  the  result  that  a
    transfer order has been made, enabling me to complete  that  task.   At
    the hearing before me on 6 March 2014, Mr Goldborough indicated that he
    would not wish to call any evidence.  Ms  Williams,  however,  told  me
    that she had signed a  contract  of  employment  with  Jays  Care  Home
    Limited in February 2014 in order to  undertake  part-time  work  as  a
    carer (a job she  has  done  in  the  past:  [18]  of  Judge  Elliman's
    determination).

5.   The sponsor has a small child by a man who is not the father of  either
    of the appellants.  It is common ground that this child  could  not  be
    expected to live in Jamaica.  Amongst other  things,  he  suffers  from
    learning difficulties.  The care needs of the child  have,  in  effect,
    meant that the sponsor  has  been  unable  to  engage  in  sufficiently
    remunerative employment to enable the appellants to join  her  and  her
    young son without creating a situation in which the combined  financial
    needs of the parties, calculated objectively (as they must)  could  not
    be met by those parties.

6.   At [22] of her determination, Judge Elliman  considered  the  issue  of
    proportionality in terms of Article 8:-

         "I have noted above that the requirements of the rules  in  respect
         of maintenance cannot be met and it is tempting  to  conclude  that
         Article 8 cannot simply override that requirement  which  has  been
         imposed  as  a  matter  of  public  policy.   However,  I  am  also
         satisfied, as I have already said above, that the sponsor has  some
         savings and resources and would ensure - as she has done so  far  -
         that she can arrange her  life  so  as  not  to  have  any  further
         recourse to public funds.  Her credibly stated intention is to work
         but simply to do so in a manner that doesn't undermine her role  as
         a carer for her youngest child.  She has sought to  avoid  reliance
         on public funds so far and it is conceivable that the  presence  of
         these two appellants, now teenagers, may assist her both in looking
         after the youngest and enable her to make arrangements to work more
         so that she can continue to provide for the family.  Their presence
         potentially reduces her reliance on public funds."

7.   Concluding that family reunification was desirable,  that  the  sponsor
    had been involved in the upbringing of  the  appellants  in  every  way
    (financial, emotional, practical) and that the relocation of the family
    to Jamaica would be detrimental to the youngest  child,  Judge  Elliman
    found in  the  appellant's  favour,  concluding  that  maintaining  the
    refusal of entry clearance represented a disproportionate response.

8.   Although her determination has been set aside, I take account of  those
    positive aspects of  the  judge's  findings.   However,  as  Mr  Melvin
    submitted, those findings are incomplete.  In particular, they  pay  no
    regard to the general burdens which  the  presence  of  the  appellants
    would have on the United Kingdom public expenditure.   Even  if  -  and
    Judge Elliman's finding is speculative - the presence of the appellants
    might help the sponsor to work longer hours, their presence would place
    additional demands on the United Kingdom's  educational  resources,  as
    well as its healthcare resources.  It is considerations  of  this  kind
    that have led the Higher Courts to point out that, where a person fails
    to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules, it is unlikely  that
    Article 8 can be successfully invoked,  particularly  where  the  issue
    comes down to maintenance without recourse to public funds. As  Rix  LJ
    held in AAO v Entry Clearance Officer [2011] EWCA Civ 840:-

         "As  Strasbourg  and  domestic   jurisprudence   has   consistently
         emphasised... states are entitled to have regard to their system of
         immigration control and its generally consistent application, and a
         requirement that an entrant should be maintained  without  recourse
         to public funds is an ultimately fair and necessary  limitation  on
         what would otherwise become a possibly overwhelming burden  on  all
         of its citizens.  It is an unfortunate reality of life that states,
         especially  one  like  the  United  Kingdom  which   is   generally
         accessible  and  welcoming  to  refugees  and  immigrants,   cannot
         undertake to allow all members of a family to join  together  here,
         even those members who can show emotional and financial dependency,
         without creating unsupportable burdens."

9.   It is also  relevant  to  observe  that,  although  Article  8  clearly
    encompasses family reunion within its ambit,

         "23. The trauma of breaking  up  a  family  and  thereby  rupturing
             family ties may be significantly greater than  the  effect  of
             not facilitating the reunion of a family  whose  members  have
             become accustomed to living apart following a decision by part
             of the family to live elsewhere.


         24.  Where entry is sought for the purpose of  family  reunion  the
             Immigration  Rules,  laid  before  Parliament,  represent   an
             attempt by the Government to strike  a  fair  balance  between
             respect  for  family  life  and  immigration  control,   which
             includes economic considerations.... The  authorities  provide
             examples of cases which  fall  outside  the  rules  where  the
             positive obligation of the state under Article 8 requires  the
             giving of leave to enter.  Such cases are often difficult  and
             require close analysis of the facts."  (Muse v Entry Clearance
             Officer [2012] EWCA Civ 10; Toulson LJ)

10.  In the present case, the sponsor choose to leave  the  appellants  when
    they were young, in order to  come  to  the  United  Kingdom  for  what
    appears to be economic  reasons.   The  children  were  left  with  the
    sponsor's mother (their grandmother) who has provided a home  for  them
    in Jamaica while they have been growing, albeit that  the  sponsor  was
    found  to  have  sole  responsibility  and  to  have   made   financial
    contributions  to  their  upbringing.   There  is  evidence  that   the
    grandmother has a neuroma in her right hand but  there  is  no  medical
    support for her contention to generally be in "failing health"  or  for
    her to "think my time on earth may be coming to a close" (letter  of  1
    March 2012).  At E86, there is a brief letter from a doctor  indicating
    that surgery on her right hand was an option and that  the  grandmother
    should "desist from taking on any strenuous activity as this will  only
    serve to aggravate her condition".

11.  At E10 and E11, there  are  letters  from  the  appellants'  respective
    schools.  Z is said to be often late for classes, frequently truant and
    aggressive  towards  her  peers.   Counselling  revealed  that  it  was
    "evident that [Z] was hurting because of the separation from her mother
    and  the  lack  of  communication  with  her  father"  and   that   the
    grandmother's "ill-health" has made it difficult for her to care for Z.
     The general opinion of teachers was that "[Z's] best  interests  would
    be to live with her mother in the United Kingdom".  R,  meanwhile,  has
    often been "disruptive" and "insolent" and demonstrated  "insubordinate
    behaviour towards both his peers and teachers".  Again, he was said  to
    have been referred for counselling "where it was discovered that he  is
    suffering from the absence of his parents, and as such  this  manifests
    itself in the above-listed anti-social tendencies".  It was thought  to
    be in the best interests of R "to be where his mother is".

12.  There are serious problems with the assertions in  these  letters.   To
    begin with, it is entirely unclear when the asserted  behaviour  began.
    The implication is that it was only relatively recently; otherwise  one
    could have expected an earlier referral for counselling  to  have  been
    recorded.  This immediately raises questions, as it is difficult on the
    face  of  it  to  see  why  the  children  should  only  recently  have
    demonstrated problems arising from their separation from  the  sponsor.
    In any event, the genuineness of the "counselling" is questionable.  No
    attempt appears to have been made to investigate the  circumstances  of
    the sponsor in the United Kingdom or her  willingness  and  ability  to
    provide  an  environment  in  which  the  appellants'  behaviour  might
    improve.  In conclusion, I consider  these  letters  to  have  all  the
    hallmarks of having been written  to  order  and  that  their  contents
    cannot be relied upon.

13.  In Mundeba (s.55 and para 297(1)(f)) [2013] UKUT 88  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal (Blake J and Upper Tribunal Judge Dawson) gave guidance on the
    assessment  of  family  considerations  in   entry   clearance   cases,
    concerning children.  The Tribunal considered that the focus needed  to
    be on the circumstances of the child in the light of his  or  her  age,
    social background and developmental history involving an enquiry as  to
    whether:-

    "(a) there is evidence of neglect or abuse;


    (b)  there are unmet needs that should be catered for; and


    (c)  there are stable arrangements for the child's physical care."

14.  The overall assessment  would  determine  whether  the  combination  of
    circumstances were  sufficiently  serious  and  compelling  to  require
    admission.   Although  the  starting  point  would  be  that  the  best
    interests of a child were usually best served by being with both or  at
    least one of their parents, continuity of residence was another factor,
    as was change in the place of residence where a child has grown up  for
    a number of years when socially aware.

15.  In the present case, there is no evidence to indicate neglect or  abuse
    of  the  appellants  in  Jamaica.   Despite  the   problem   with   the
    grandmother's hand, they are of an age when they are not dependent upon
    her for everyday tasks.  Indeed, their presence in the  United  Kingdom
    was considered by Judge Elliman to be likely to involve the appellant's
    helping to care for their young half-brother.  What  they  might  think
    about this is unclear.  So too is whether they would be suitable  part-
    time carers, assuming their  anti-social  behaviour,  as  described  by
    their schools, is or may be true.

16.  Like Judge Elliman, I formed a  positive  impression  of  the  sponsor.
    She clearly has a genuine desire to see the appellants living with  her
    in the United Kingdom.  The fact is, however, that through  her  choice
    the sponsor came to the United Kingdom in 2002, when the children  were
    4 and 7 years old and she has not lived with them since.  Judge Elliman
    considered that the sponsor's witness statement showed her "fighting to
    remain in the  United  Kingdom",  which  suggests  that  this  was  the
    sponsor's main aim (she became a British citizen in April 2012).

17.   I accept the veracity of the sponsor's evidence that she has  recently
    undertaken to resume work.   This  reinforces  the  findings  of  Judge
    Elliman that the sponsor would do her best to ensure that she, her  son
    and the appellants would not be a burden on public funds,  albeit  that
    the requirements of the Rules could  not  be  satisfied.  However,  the
    yardstick for  what  is  adequate  maintenance  is,  as  I  have  said,
    objective. It is based on the respondent's assessment of how much money
    a family needs in order to live without unacceptable  hardship.  It  is
    problematic to hypothesise that, if admitted, the appellants would,  in
    practice, find themselves part of a family  unit  that  was  trying  to
    subsist below that level. Conversely, it is speculative to assume  that
    the presence of  the  appellants  would  enable  the  sponsor  to  earn
    sufficient to lift the family above the requisite threshold. The  stark
    reality, which must be faced in determining whether human rights compel
    the admission of  the  appellants,  is  that  there  is  a  significant
    likelihood that reliance on public funds would increase, as well as the
    additional demands on health and  educational  provision  described  in
    paragraph 8 above. There is, thus, a potent public interest  in  favour
    of maintaining the entry clearance officer's decisions, which  must  be
    set on the respondent's side of the proportionality balance.

17.  Looking at matters overall, I do not find  that  the  positive  factors
    identified by Judge  Elliman  are  such  as  to  outweigh  the  state's
    interest  in  maintaining  an   effective   immigration   control,   as
    articulated at [49] of AAO.  I also do not consider it has  been  shown
    that the appellants are suffering problems in Jamaica, which are likely
    to be eliminated or, at least, alleviated if they were to come to  live
    in the United Kingdom.  As I have said, the evidence from  the  schools
    is problematic.  The evidence  regarding  the  grandmother's  infirmity
    does not show any consequential adverse impact upon the appellants.  It
    is unclear how they would react to coming to live  in  a  country  with
    which they are unfamiliar, with a mother that they have effectively not
    known since they were small, and with a much younger half-sibling,  who
    has learning difficulties.  Their best  interests  do  not,  in  short,
    clearly point towards their coming to live in the United Kingdom.

18.  In conclusion, on the evidence  before  me,  I  do  not  consider  that
    maintaining the refusals of entry clearance  would  violate  the  human
    rights of the appellants, the sponsor, the sponsor's  young  child  or,
    indeed, anyone else.

Decision

19.  The determination of the First-tier Tribunal having been set  aside,  I
    re-make the decision in the appellants' appeals by dismissing them.




                               Signed                                  Date




                               Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane



                                   APPENDIX



Decision as to error of law and directions


    "1.  This is the respondents' application in respect of the decision of
         the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Elliman  who  in  a  determination
         promulgated on 3 September 2013 found for the two minor  appellants
         in their favour in relation to the fact that their  mother  in  the
         United Kingdom, Alecia Williams, was exercising sole responsibility
         but also in the same determination accepted  that  the  maintenance
         requirements of the Rules could not be  met  at  the  time  of  the
         hearing.  That has not really been addressed in  detail  before  me
         and I think in essence this is not a material matter -  it  appears
         clear that  the  relevant  council  were  prepared  to  accept  the
         appellants as additional occupants of the  emergency  housing  they
         were providing for the appellants' mother.  That arguably  may  not
         impact on the reliance on public funds  argument  in  any  material
         way.

    2.   What has been argued is that the judge, after  going  on  to  find
         that the appellants could not succeed under the Rules having regard
         to the decision in KA & Others  [2006]  UKAIT  00065,  went  on  to
         consider the question as to whether or not  the  appeal  should  be
         allowed in relation to Article  8  without  having  regard  to  her
         earlier finding when assessing question of proportionality.  It  is
         against that aspect of the decision of the  First-tier  Judge  that
         the respondent applies with leave granted in the First-tier.

    3.   The grounds argue firstly, that the judge should have  had  regard
         to the Immigration Rules in making the Article 8 assessment  and  I
         have adopted the test that in the hearing today I am looking at the
         broad principles, not the narrow argument  that  the  human  rights
         should have been considered within the structure of the Immigration
         Rules in Appendix FM.  The advocates agreed that  that  was  a  too
         academic approach and I should look at the substantial merits.

    4.   The Respondent also argued  that  whatever  approach  was  adopted
         there is a requirement to give adequate reasons and there was not a
         sufficiency of reasons relating to  the  decision,  essentially  in
         relation to the proportionality exercise carried out by  the  judge
         in paragraph 22.  Although I have listened very carefully  to  what
         Mr Young has argued on behalf of the children I  am  not  satisfied
         that he has really been able to answer the  substantial  merits  of
         the respondent's arguments.  For that it is necessary  to  go  into
         the detail of the determination.

    5.   It is accepted that at the time of the  immigration  decision  the
         sponsor's earnings were variable.  There is no direct  finding  and
         the judge said she was not helped by a clear  schedule.   What  the
         judge records are payslips from Sports Direct for the  sponsor  for
         July, August and October 2012 showing income  ranging  from  �93  a
         month to �358.  It was agreed at the hearing before the judge  that
         the minimum income support level would be �1,152.  Even taking  the
         sponsor's case  at  the  highest  therefore  of  �358  there  is  a
         shortfall of just under �800 a month.  It is agreed that at date of
         decision the sponsor had savings  of  just  over  �3,000  but  that
         shortfall would mean that if all the appellants were  allowed  into
         the United Kingdom it would be used up within four months.  �800 is
         obviously a very substantial shortfall and the reliability of  that
         income is not well-evidenced.  As I  have  said  the  sponsor  just
         started work and there is no finding of fact on the reliability  of
         that income and indeed by the time of the hearing before the  judge
         the sponsor had stated she had ceased work and was looking for work
         because of the needs of her son Raheem  who  everyone  accepts  has
         special educational needs.

    6.   The other matter that causes me concern is paragraph 20.  That  is
         where the judge considers it not necessary to determine whether the
         appellants meet the requirements of paragraph 297(i)(f) that is, is
         their exclusion  undesirable  in  view  of  the  obstacles  of  the
         maintenance  payments.   That  is  unfortunate  because  there  are
         matters contained in the sponsor's evidence that arguably  goes  to
         say that the children's exclusion from the UK  is  undesirable  but
         there is no finding on that point which makes the difficulty of the
         judge when balancing out matters under Razgar very difficult.  What
         she has done finally at the  end  of  that  paragraph  stating  the
         compelling reasons that tip the  balance,  desirability  of  family
         reunification, the fact their mother have been  involved  in  their
         upbringing and the relocation of the family as a whole  to  Jamaica
         will be detrimental to the youngest child.   There  is  however  no
         reasoning or clear finding as to these matters.

    7.   What she has not recorded is that the  children's  exclusion  from
         the United Kingdom would be to their gross detriment and there  are
         grave reasons essentially having regard to the public interest that
         they should be admitted.  That is of relevance  and  I  accept  the
         respondent has quite cogently argued that that is  essentially  the
         public interest test.  If there are very cogent public reasons  why
         the exclusion of these children from the United Kingdom as of  date
         of decision is undesirable, then the argument of the  shortfall  of
         maintenance is a balancing exercise.  It would then be  within  the
         terms  of  a  proper  judicial  discretion  and  an   exercise   of
         proportionality on those grounds would  be  one  that  I  would  be
         satisfied it would not be appropriate to interfere with on  review.
         I am satisfied however that in this particular case the  judge  has
         not exercised proportionality on that basis.

    8.   There is generally an unfortunate lack of findings  of  fact  that
         could then justify the proportionality decision.  As I have said it
         is both as to the shortfall of maintenance, how that could possibly
         be met from savings.  The judge  has  certainly  said  that  it  is
         conceivable these two appellants, now teenagers, would  assist  the
         sponsor in her employment which is an error firstly looking forward
         from circumstances as of date of decision  and  secondly  again  if
         that an evidential finding as to  a  circumstance  as  of  date  of
         decision, if so where is the evidence to justify that.   There   is
         obviously some contrary  evidence  within  the  Appellants'  bundle
         which suggests that would be an unrealistic assumption.

    9.   Whilst I do have regard to the needs of the child  in  the  United
         Kingdom there is also the need to have due  regard  to  the  public
         interest which ultimately is that these two children when they come
         here are adequately maintained.  It would not  be  appropriate  for
         two children, who it would appear from their  school  reports  have
         difficulties in any  event,  to  have  a  shortfall  of  income  of
         approximately  �800  a  month  from  their  mother.   It  is   very
         substantial.

    10.  So for all those reasons I am satisfied there was an error of  law
         on this occasion in the exercise of proportionality and I therefore
         direct that this matter goes forward to  a  re-evaluation.   It  is
         clear there has got to be evidence called.  The directions indicate
         that  the  matter  would  not  necessarily   proceed   today.    My
         preliminary view is that as there has been a full  hearing  in  the
         First-tier it would be inappropriate to return it to the First-tier
         and the matter should be  concluded  with  a  continuation  hearing
         before me as soon as we can manage but if either advocate wants  to
         argue the matter should otherwise be determined  I  will  now  hear
         from you.

    11.  After hearing no objection to the proposed course  I  direct  that
         there is a continuation hearing before me on a date to be fixed."
