                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. This is a resumed hearing listed before me to hear submissions  on  Mrs
    Akinsoyinu's ("the claimant") Article 8 claim.  On  26  August  2016  I
    heard the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal against a decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Drabu CBE who, in  a  decision  promulgated  on  12
    February 2016, allowed the claimants' appeal.  I found that  there  was
    an error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision and I  set  aside
    that decision.   I  decided  that  I  could  remake  the  decision  but
    adjourned the matter for a further hearing in relation  to  Article  8.
    The findings of the First-tier Tribunal in relation to the genuine  and
    subsisting relationship between  the  claimant  and  the  sponsor  were
    preserved.

 2. The background to this matter is set out in my earlier  decision  which
    is appended hereto. The claimant is a citizen of Nigeria.  Her date  of
    birth is 24 April 1965.  She applied for entry clearance as a spouse of
    Mr Festus  Akinsoyinu,  a  British  Citizen.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissed the claimant's appeal under the Immigration Rules because the
    claimant cannot meet the financial requirements of the Rules. There was
    no cross appeal against that decision.  The  only  issue  therefore  is
    whether or not the claimant can succeed  on  the  basis  of  Article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules.

The Hearing before the Upper Tribunal

 3. Mr Jesurum called the sponsor, Mr Festus Akinsoyinu, to give  evidence.
    The sponsor in oral evidence said that he  had  four  children  in  the
    United Kingdom and eight grandchildren  who  he  visits  on  a  regular
    basis.  He travels to Milton Keynes once a month and to Stevenage  once
    a fortnight.  He visits his grandchildren in Watford once a  week.   He
    said that he had one family member in Nigeria, his eldest  sister  aged
    82.  He would be able to stay with his sister in Nigeria  for  a  short
    period of time.  She has a two bedroom flat but she has two people  who
    live with her to assist her as she is paralysed.  When the sponsor goes
    to Nigeria he sleeps in the carers'  bedroom  and  they  sleep  in  the
    living room.  He said that his wife has a flat but that he cannot  stay
    in the flat.  He said that his wife has five children  of  her  own  in
    Nigeria.  When he goes to Nigeria he takes his medications with him  so
    that he does not have to buy anything in  Nigeria.   His  evidence  was
    that healthcare in Nigeria is not free and neither are medications  and
    that he would not be able to afford to pay for his medication.

 4. In cross-examination he said that his wife was a businesswoman involved
    in trading.  When asked why his wife would not be able to pay  for  the
    medical costs out of her savings he said that she could not do that but
    did not say why.  He said that he could not live with his wife  in  her
    flat because her children, who live with their father, come to visit at
    weekends.  When asked if he and his wife had discussed the  possibility
    that she might not be able to come to the UK he answered  that  he  had
    never thought of that.  He confirmed  that  he  was  currently  working
    undertaking stewarding, that the work is not set hours and  depends  on
    how many events he works at.  He said that his employment with Reed had
    stopped about three years ago.  He is in receipt of a state pension.

 5. In response to my questions the sponsor told me that he could not share
    his wife's bedroom in the flat when the children came to visit  because
    her daughters stayed in her room with her and the boys  stayed  in  the
    other bedroom.  When asked how much the drugs cost he initially said he
    had no idea and then said he knew that it cost  not  less  than  10,000
    naira.  He indicated that his cousin takes metformin tablets  and  that
    it costs 15,000 naira for two tablets.  When asked why his  wife  could
    not pay for the medication from her �30,000 savings he  said  that  she
    pays university fees and school fees for her children.

 6. In re-examination the sponsor indicated that  he  took  one  tablet  of
    metformin per day. Mr Jesurum undertook a calculation and worked out at
    an exchange rate of 542 naira to the pound the cost of  each  metformin
    tablet would be about �5 per tablet.  The sponsor did not know how much
    the other medication he took cost.



 7. Further evidence was provided in the form of a letter from Acton Health
    Centre signed by Dr A Adesanoye.  The letter sets out that the  sponsor
    has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease,
    pure  hypercholesterolemia,  previous  perforated  duodenal  ulcer  and
    chronic kidney disease, stage 3.  The letter indicates that the sponsor
    has been relatively stable on medications until recently  when  he  has
    been very anxious and stressed due to domestic issues.  A list  of  the
    sponsor's current medication was annexed to that letter.

 8. I also considered the written witness statements previously provided by
    the claimant and the sponsor.

Submissions

 9. Mr Tarlow submitted that there was nothing exceptional and  there  were
    no compelling circumstances  in  this  case.   The  appellant  and  the
    sponsor have accommodation available in Nigeria and they have the funds
    to purchase medication.  Mr Tarlow submitted that although the  sponsor
    had indicated there was some difficulties in living with his wife there
    was no indication that the sponsor and his wife could  not  make  other
    arrangements to secure accommodation.  He submitted that the  Secretary
    of State has responsibility to control the immigration  in  the  public
    interest.  He submitted that in conducting the proportionality exercise
    there was nothing to bring the proportionality exercise  in  favour  of
    the claimant and the Article 8 claim should be dismissed.

10. Mr Jesurum submitted that it was not clear whether or  not  the  appeal
    was limited to Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.   He  submitted
    that EX.1 sets the test of insurmountable obstacles but that in  effect
    there was no real difference to consideration outside  the  Immigration
    Rules and EX.1.  He submitted that this was a compelling case and  that
    there  was  an  accumulation  of  circumstances  which  taken  together
    amounted to compelling circumstances.  He submitted  that  the  sponsor
    has children in the United  Kingdom  and  grandchildren  that  he  sees
    regularly and that he has a strong private life.  He submitted that the
    sponsor is now 73 years old and it  is  more  difficult  for  an  older
    person to re-establish themselves when moving to another  country.   He
    asserted that the key element is the medical conditions of the sponsor.
     He is a British citizen and is entitled to medical  treatment  in  the
    United Kingdom.  He asked me to accept the evidence regarding the  cost
    of treatment in Nigeria.

11. Mr Jesurum submitted that there were very serious difficulties for  the
    sponsor whose medical needs will increase over time and that  it  would
    be unduly harsh to expect him to go to Nigeria.  He  accepted  that  in
    principle other arrangements could be made regarding  accommodation  in
    Nigeria but submitted that there was no evidence  as  to  the  cost  or
    practicality of making those arrangements.   He  submitted  that  there
    would be no recourse to public funds in this case because  the  sponsor
    has considerable savings, that she would be able to work in the  United
    Kingdom and in fact there would be a positive  benefit  to  the  public
    funds because the appellant would be able to  look  after  the  sponsor
    thereby reducing the chance of him  requiring  support  out  of  public
    funds.  In answer to my question Mr Jesurum referred me to SI 1556/2011
    NHS charges to overseas visitors which he asserted makes it clear  that
    if the sponsor were to leave the United Kingdom to reside in Nigeria he
    would not be able to receive free NHS care and prescriptions in the UK.
     He referred to Regulation  2  which  provides  the  definition  of  an
    overseas visitor which is a  person  not  ordinarily  resident  in  the
    United Kingdom.



12. I indicated that in the hearing on 26 August I had asked the parties to
    provide objective evidence regarding medical treatment and the cost  of
    treatment in Nigeria if this was to  be  relied  upon.   Neither  party
    indicated that any in-depth research had been undertaken  to  ascertain
    what the position is.  I therefore directed that within seven  days  of
    the date of the  hearing  further  evidence  and  submissions  on  that
    evidence was to be submitted by Miss  Akinsoyinu's  representative,  if
    the cost and availability of medical care was  to  be  relied  on,  and
    within seven days of service of that the Secretary of State was to make
    any reply and/or serve any evidence in relation to medical treatment in
    Nigeria.

13.  On  27  October  further  evidence  was  served  by   the   claimant's
    representative, DF Solicitors  together  with  an  explanation  of  the
    research that had been undertaken and the response they  had  received.
    In essence the claimant's representative had contacted two hospitals in
    Nigeria, Lagos State University  Teaching  Hospital  and  Eko  and  two
    chemists, CCD on Ogudu Road Ojota and Ivory Chemist in  Mende  Maryland
    Lagos but they could not give  written  confirmation  of  the  cost  of
    medication. An online search of the medicines was undertaken and copies
    of the printout from  Drugs.com  were  submitted.  The  representatives
    calculated that from the prices, it will cost an average of  �785.01  a
    month for the sponsor's medication, this equates to �9,420 a  year.  It
    was asserted that on the claimant's current savings  of  N  7,805014.58
    which is �19,893.50, the savings will be completely depleted in just  2
    years. It was submitted that the sponsor sees his GP regularly at least
    once  a  week  and  he  is  under  the  care  of  a  Cardiologist   and
    endocrinologist  whom  he  sees  twice  a  year.  The  cost   of   such
    consultations is not clear and neither is the availability of the level
    of expertise required.

14. A newspaper report from Punch Newspapers of Nigeria from  23rd  October
    2016 was included which highlights  the  issues  of  expired  drugs  in
    Nigeria. A report from the World Health  Organisation,  from  2005  was
    also submitted. An article from 'THISDAYLIVE' April 28, 2016 concerning
    'Discontent  over  Health  Budget  cuts'  was  included  which  it  was
    submitted  highlights  how  inadequate  the  healthcare  system  is  in
    Nigeria.

15. No further evidence was served by the Respondent.

Discussion


16. The claimant cannot meet the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    When conducting an assessment outside the Immigration Rules a  Tribunal
    must conduct this assessment  through  the  prism  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  In SS (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  it  was  held  that  the
    Immigration Rules themselves provide  significant  evidence  about  the
    public interest and appropriate weight must be given to  the  Secretary
    of State's formulation of the public interest factors when the Tribunal
    is balancing interests under Article 8:

         32.     However, even away from those contexts, if the Secretary of
         State has sought to formulate Immigration Rules to reflect  a  fair
         balance of interests under Article 8 in the general  run  of  cases
         falling within their scope, then, as  explained  above,  the  Rules
         themselves will provide significant  evidence  about  the  relevant
         public interest considerations which should be brought into account
         when a court or tribunal seeks to  strike  the  proper  balance  of
         interests under Article 8 in making its own decision. As Beatson LJ
         observed  in  Haleemudeen  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the   Home
         Department [2014] EWCA Civ 558; [2014] Imm AR 6, at [40],  the  new
         Rules in Appendix FM:

             "... are a central part of the legislative and policy  context
             in which the interests of  immigration  control  are  balanced
             against the interests and rights of people who  have  come  to
             this country and wish to settle in it. Overall, the  Secretary
             of State's policy as to when an interference with an Article 8
             right  will  be   regarded   as   disproportionate   is   more
             particularised in the new Rules than it had previously been."

         Accordingly, a court or tribunal is required to give the new  Rules
         "greater  weight  than  as  merely  a  starting   point   for   the
         consideration  of  the  proportionality  of  an  interference  with
         Article 8 rights" (para. [47]).

         33.     In our judgment, even though a test of exceptionality  does
         not apply in every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it
         is accurate to say that the general position outside the  sorts  of
         special contexts referred to above is that compelling circumstances
         would need to be identified to support a claim  for  grant  of  LTR
         outside the new Rules in Appendix  FM.  In  our  view,  that  is  a
         formulation which is not as strict as a test of exceptionality or a
         requirement of "very compelling reasons"  (as  referred  to  in  MF
         (Nigeria) in  the  context  of  the  Rules  applicable  to  foreign
         criminals), but which  gives  appropriate  weight  to  the  focused
         consideration of public interest factors as finds expression in the
         Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in  Appendix  FM.
         It also reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which  has
         been tested and has survived scrutiny in  this  court:  see,  e.g.,
         Haleemudeen at [44], per Beatson LJ...

         48.     What does matter, however - whether one is dealing  with  a
         section of the Rules which constitutes a "complete code" (as in  MF
         (Nigeria)) or with a section of the Rules which is not a  "complete
         code" (as in Nagre and the present appeals) - is to  identify,  for
         the purposes of application of Article 8, the degree of  weight  to
         be attached to the expression of public policy in  the  substantive
         part of the Rules in the particular context in question (which will
         not always be the same: hence the guidance we seek to give in  this
         judgment), as well as the other factors relevant to the  Article  8
         balancing exercise in the particular case (which, again,  may  well
         vary from context to context and  from  case  to  case).  (Emphasis
         added)

17. The correct approach to determining a claim under Article 8 outside the
    Immigration Rules is that set out in R v SSHD ex  parte  Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 27. A Tribunal should consider 5 questions, namely:

         (i) Will the proposed  removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
         authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to respect for
         his private or (as the case may be) family life?

         (ii) If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
         gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

         (iii) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

         (iv) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
         in the  interests  of  national  security,  public  safety  or  the
         economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention  of  disorder
         or crime, for the protection  of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the
         protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

         (v) If so, is such interference  proportionate  to  the  legitimate
         public end sought to be achieved?"

18. The public interest will generally only be outweighed if  an  applicant
    can show that "compelling circumstances" exist - see [40] to [42] of SS
    (Congo).

19. There were issues that are not adequately covered  by  the  Immigration
    Rules in this case including the sponsor's health, his age and prospect
    of affordable treatment for his  conditions  in  Nigeria.  I  therefore
    consider  that  this  case  requires  consideration  outside   of   the
    Immigration Rules but that in order to succeed the claimant  will  need
    to demonstrate that compelling circumstances exist.

20. The claimant and the sponsor are (as found by the First-tier  Tribunal)
    in a genuine and subsisting relationship and it is not in dispute  that
    the first four questions posed in Razgar  are  answered  affirmatively.
    The sponsor currently has part time, sporadic,  employment  undertaking
    marshalling at various events. There was no evidence that he  would  be
    unable to obtain similar employment in Nigeria. However, the age of the
    sponsor (73) makes  it  unlikely  that  he  would  find  employment  in
    Nigeria. He is in receipt of a pension. The claimant has  a  successful
    business. She has built up a considerable  amount  in  savings  over  a
    relatively short period of time. I  was  informed  of  various  amounts
    ranging from �20,000 to �30,000.

21. It is clear that the sponsor requires medical treatment  on  a  regular
    basis. He has a number of medical  complaints.  He  has  a  history  of
    hypertension,  type  2   diabetes,   ischemic   heart   disease,   pure
    hypercholesterolemia, previous perforated duodenal  ulcer  and  chronic
    kidney disease, stage 3.  I was not provided  with  evidence  that  the
    sponsor would be unable to  obtain  treatment  for  his  conditions  in
    Nigeria. The sponsor is a British citizen and entitled to  free  health
    care in the UK. The sponsor cannot be described as a fit, healthy  man.
    It is plain that his health is managed  through  regular  consultations
    and there is a need for medical treatment  on  an  on-going  basis.   I
    accept that he would have to pay for all treatment received in  Nigeria
    arising out of his health problems. Although evidence of the diagnostic
    costs was not produced, there was some, albeit limited, evidence of the
    cost of the drugs he regularly takes if obtained via  the  internet.  I
    accept that the costs would deplete the claimant's savings within a few
    years although it is not clear that this would  occur  within  the  two
    years asserted.

22. I accept the evidence of the sponsor that he has extended family in the
    UK and that he sees them on a  regular  basis.  However,  although  the
    sponsor sees his family regularly it is plain that the ties that  exist
    are no more than the normal family ties.

23. I am mandated by Parliament to  give  effect  to  section  117  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Section 117A  is  engaged
    because I am required to decide whether  the  impugned  decision  would
    breach the right to respect for family life under Article 8.

24. The starting point is consideration of the Immigration  Rules.  As  set
    out above the claimant cannot meet the requirements of the  Rules.  The
    public interest considerations as expressed within  the  Rules  do  not
    extend the right to enter the UK where the financial  requirements  are
    not met. In this  case  the  claimant  does  have  significant  savings
    although it is not clear that these are available in their entirety  to
    the claimant as the sponsor indicated that she is required to  pay  for
    her children's education from these fees.

25. Sufficient weight must be  accorded  to  the  public  interest  in  the
    maintenance of effective immigration controls (s117B(1)).  The  sponsor
    said that he had not given any consideration to the fact that his  wife
    may not be granted entry to the UK. He considered that he had  a  right
    to have his wife with him in the UK even though she has no  entitlement
    to entry to or leave to remain in the UK. It is the right of all states
    to control the entry and residence of aliens. Although  the  respondent
    is not relying on paragraph 320 (11)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  the
    claimant admitted in  her  witness  statement  to  working  in  the  UK
    unlawfully and obtaining false papers to enable her to do so. That fact
    cannot be ignored when assessing the  weight  to  be  afforded  to  the
    public interest. The weight to be afforded to the  public  interest  is
    intensified on the facts of this case.

26. Sufficient weight must be accorded to the  interests  of  the  economic
    well-being of the United Kingdom, in that persons who seek to enter  or
    remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  must   be   financially   independent
    (s117B(3)). The claimant does have savings. It was argued  that  it  is
    likely that the claimant's entry to the  UK  would  reduce  any  future
    burden on public resources as she will care for the  sponsor.  This  is
    speculative. However, I accept that the claimant is unlikely  to  be  a
    burden on public resources given  her  level  of  savings  and  earning
    capacity.

27. When balancing the factors I find that this is a very  finely  balanced
    case but on balance the public interest is outweighed by the compelling
    circumstances in this case. These are, the sponsor's age (73)  and  his
    numerous health problems and that he is under the care of a  number  of
    health professionals in the UK.  Although not decisive it  is  relevant
    that he is unlikely to be able to afford treatment in Nigeria  for  any
    sustained period of time. The refusal to grant the  claimant  leave  to
    remain in the UK is disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued  and
    therefore the claimant's appeal against the Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision is allowed
