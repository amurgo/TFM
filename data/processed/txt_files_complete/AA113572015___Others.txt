                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1.    This matter was last before me on 6 February 2017 when I determined
      that there had been an error of law in the decision of the  First-tier
      Tribunal, in consequence of which I set aside the Tribunal's  disposal
      under Article 3 of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.  For
      convenience, the error of law determination is included as an appendix
      to this Decision.


      Background


   2.   The principal appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka, born on [ ] 1968.
      He arrived in the United Kingdom in 2007  in  possession  of  a  valid
      student visa. His wife secured a visa to join him the following  year,
      as did their  three  children  in  2011.  The  appellant's  leave  was
      extended until 30 January 2013. Prior to its  expiry,  but  some  five
      years after entering the United Kingdom, he claimed  asylum  in  April
      2012.


   3.   In 2012 the appellant had been convicted in Sri Lanka of an  offence
      concerning the unlawful detention of a child and sentenced to a period
      of imprisonment of  three  years.  The  trial  had  proceeded  in  the
      appellant's absence although he had the benefit of  legal  advice  and
      representation for at least part of the criminal process.


   4.   The appellant's claim for asylum was rejected  as  he  was  excluded
      from protection under Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention  on  the
      basis that he had committed  a  serious  non-political  crime  in  Sri
      Lanka. His claim for humanitarian protection  was  similarly  refused,
      under rule 339D(v) of  the  Immigration  Rules.  There  is  no  appeal
      against these  determinations  and  the  findings  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal have been expressly preserved.


   5.   The sole issue upon which the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  falls
      to be remade concerns the appellant's claim under  Article  3.  It  is
      submitted that were he to  be  returned  to  Sri  Lanka  he  would  be
      required to serve the sentence imposed by the criminal court and  that
      the conditions of his detention in Sri Lanka's prisons would amount to
      inhuman or degrading treatment.


   6.   The matter was adjourned to allow the parties to  adduce  additional
      evidence, including expert reports. The appellant submitted  a  bundle
      running to 100 pages. Notwithstanding its late service,  no  objection
      was taken by Mr Melvin on behalf of the respondent  who  indicated  he
      was not disadvantaged. There was no  further  evidence  filed  by  the
      respondent. Instead, Mr Melvin handed  up  written  submissions.  Both
      counsel were content that the matter be  dealt  with  on  submissions,
      without the  calling  of  any  live  evidence.  The  submissions  were
      directed solely to the material in the appellant's  bundle.  All  page
      references hereafter in square brackets are to those of  that  bundle,
      save where the contrary is stated.


   7.   It was accepted by both parties that my determination in respect  of
      the appellant would be dispositive of the  parasitic  appeals  of  his
      wife and children.


      The appellant's submissions


   8. Ms Harris, for the  appellants,  took  me  to  various  parts  of  the
      material in appellants' bundle concerning:


   i. the conditions in Sri Lankan prisons generally; and
  ii. the likely treatment of the appellant upon his return to Sri Lanka and
      subsequent  detention  by  the  civilian  authorities  to  serve   his
      sentence.


      It was conceded by Ms Harris  that  the  appellant  would  not  be  of
      interest to the security forces in the political context envisaged  in
      GJ and Others (post-civil war: returnees) Sri  Lanka  CG  [2013]  UKUT
      00319 (IAC).


   a. Prison conditions in Sri Lanka generally

   9.   On the first issue, Ms Harris made reference to the  Sri  Lanka  COI
      Compilation dated December 2016 prepared by the Austrian Red Cross [pp
      50 et seq]. She referred to the US Department of  State  Human  Rights
      2015 [pp 70-71] which recorded that "prison conditions were  poor  due
      to old infrastructure, overcrowding,  and  shortage  of  sanitary  and
      other basic facilities". It noted [p  70]  that  the  commissioner  of
      prisons estimated that the prison population exceeded capacity by some
      60%.


  10. The Compilation quoted from the preliminary observations (May 2016) of
      the UN Special Rapporteur on torture  and  other  cruel,  inhuman  and
      degrading treatment [p 71]  in  similar  terms  to  the  final  Report
      (December 2016) quoted  below.  The  prefatory  comment  reads:  "With
      regard to the treatment of prisoners by staff  in  penitentiaries  and
      remand prisoners, I note  with  satisfaction  that  in  conducting  my
      interviews I did not receive any  serious  complaints",  but  see  the
      concern (below) that prisoners may have been discouraged from speaking
      to the delegation.


  11. The Rapporteur also  records  having  observed  levels  of  population
      exceeding capacity by well over 200  or  300  per  cent  [p  71],  and
      observes that the Sri Lankan government has  indicated  that  Welikada
      prison will be closed and a new one built in Tangelle but, as at 2015,
      this was not yet in the planning stages [p 72].


  12. The Compilation notes that the Sri Lankan NGO Collective  (13  October
      2016)  concludes  at  5.35  that  "prison  conditions  need  immediate
      attention to ensure  that  prisoners  are  not  treated  in  a  cruel,
      degrading or inhuman manner",  that  meals  given  to  prisoners  lack
      nutrition and that there is also a  lack  of  medical  facilities  and
      there are no  recreational  activities  available  for  the  prisoners
      (5.35.1, 5.35.3) [p 72].  However,  the  Special  Rapporteur  reported
      elsewhere that nutrition was "adequate".


  13. A newspaper report  (Daily  News,  9  June  2016)  is  quoted  in  the
      Compilation [p 73] quoting a prison doctor  in  Welikada  recording  a
      high level of depressive illness and the lack of a doctor-on-call.  It
      indicates there is a lack of hygiene and that  prisoners  suffer  from
      physical and mental injury, as well as physical and sexual attacks. [p
      73]. The Sri Lankan NGO Collective (5.32) suggests that prison doctors
      have inferior training. [p 72]. They cannot send a victim  of  torture
      to a  junior  medical  officer  without  permission  from  the  prison
      management, and prison officials are not bound to  follow  a  doctor's
      instructions [p 74]. Lack or inadequacy of medical care  is  noted  in
      the report of the UN Special Rapporteur (below) at  paragraphs  64  et
      seq [p 38].


  14. The Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on torture  and  other  cruel,
      inhuman and degrading treatment (22 December 2016)  [p  28]  rehearses
      much of the content of the preliminary observations (May  2016)  cited
      above. Ms Harris took me to paragraph 5 [p 30]  and  the  Rapporteur's
      concern that a number of detainees had reported  that  that  they  had
      been warned not to speak to the delegation about their  treatment  and
      may have been less than forthcoming as a result. She also referred  me
      to  paragraph  52  recording  the  apparent  failure  of  the  Prisons
      Department to supply figures for  the  actual  capacity  of  detention
      facilities [p 37]. Paragraph 53 of the report states:


         "Although the Special Rapporteur did not receive any reports of ill-
         treatment by corrections staff, he found prison  conditions  to  be
         inhumane,  characterised  by  very  deficient  infrastructure   and
         pronounced overcrowding.  There  was  an  acute  lack  of  adequate
         sleeping accommodation, extreme heat and insufficient  ventilation.
         Overpopulation also results in limited access to medical treatment,
         recreational  activities  and  educational   opportunities.   These
         conditions combined constitute  in  themselves  a  form  of  cruel,
         inhuman and degrading treatment."


  15. The Special Rapporteur observed extreme levels  of  overcrowding  with
      populations exceeding capacity by 200 or 300 per cent in, for example,
      Vavuniya remand prison: paragraph 56 [p 38]. Detainees are  forced  to
      sleep back-to-back on concrete  floors  and  staircases  for  lack  of
      space. Reference is also made to crumbling nineteenth century  prisons
      in Colombo, which Ms Harris submitted was the likely  region  for  the
      appellant's incarceration. Ms Harris took me  to  paragraph  72  which
      concerned a lack of judicial oversight for remand prisoners [p 40].


  16. Ms Harris referred me to  the  comments  of  the  Special  Rapporteur,
      particularly paragraph 112 [p 45]:


         "Conditions of detention amount  to  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading
         treatment owing to severe overcrowding,  insufficient  ventilation,
         excessive heat and humidity, and the denial of adequate  access  to
         health  care,  education,  vocational  training  and   recreational
         activities."


     She also pointed to the recommendations at 117(a) for urgent repair and
     upgrade of buildings and at 117(b) for ensuring compliance with minimum
     standards [p 45].


  17. Citing the 2016 Country  Report  on  Sri  Lanka  produced  by  the  US
      Department of State [p 9], Ms Harris made  reference  to  the  section
      entitled 'Prison and Detention Center  Conditions'  [pp  11-12].  This
      recorded an estimate from the Sri Lankan authorities of  the  system's
      capacity being exceeded  by  50  per  cent.  It  noted  74  deaths  of
      prisoners, the majority of which were natural causes, with some  three
      suicides.


  18. Finally, Ms Harris took me to the Home Office's Sri Lanka  Operational
      Guidance Note (December 2011) which, as Mr  Melvin  conceded,  remains
      current and includes the following [p 84]:


         "3.9.8 Conclusion  Overcrowding  and  unsanitary  conditions  which
         amount to degrading treatment for 'ordinary'  detainees  have  been
         recorded in some prison facilities and case owners should therefore
         consider carefully whether the threshold is likely to  be  breached
         in individual cases, taking into  account  any  objective  material
         available on potential places of detention. Those perceived  to  be
         connected  to  the  LTTE,  both  men  and  women,   and   held   in
         rehabilitation camps,  prisons  or  detention  centres  may  be  at
         heightened risk of ill-treatment and torture."


  19. Ms Harris submitted that the inadequacy of  Sir  Lanka's  prisons  has
      been on the Home Office radar since at least  2011,  and  invited  the
      Tribunal to find that the situation had deteriorated in the subsequent
      years.

  20. Ms Harris submitted that there was ample evidence  from  the  material
      relied upon, especially the Special  Rapporteur's  findings,  for  the
      Tribunal to be satisfied that there would be  a  likely  violation  of
      Article 3. Further, she states that as the respondent has furnished no
      material to indicate where the appellant is  likely  to  be  held,  it
      cannot be assumed that it would be in  one  of  the  newer  or  better
      prisons. In all likelihood the appellant would be kept at a prison  in
      Colombo (there being no prison  in  his  home  town),  and  there  was
      nothing to suggest that prison conditions in Colombo were  any  better
      than the generality of facilities researched in the material.


         b. likely treatment of appellant when arrested on return


  21. Ms Harris conceded that as the appellant had already been  subject  to
      investigatory process, criminal trial and sentence,  the  observations
      in the material regarding harsh treatment of criminal suspects and the
      extraction of confessions (for example the section on the torture  and
      ill treatment of criminal suspects in the Compilation [p 56]) are  not
      of direct relevance. She nonetheless relied on personal vendettas  and
      the extortion of funds when individuals  are  taken  into  custody  as
      noted in the Human Rights Watch World Report of 2016,  quoted  in  the
      Compilation [p 57]. She submitted that the position would be analogous
      with the appellant taken into custody in order to serve his  sentence.
      She took me to the report of  the  Special  Rapporteur  (above)  which
      recorded  at  paragraph  22  that  the  practice  of  torture  at  the
      investigatory stage was less prevalent today  [p  33].  She  submitted
      that  the  appellant  would  have  to  pass   through   the   Criminal
      Investigations Department on  and  after  his  arrest  and  that  such
      organisation had a history of and reputation for acting with impunity.


  22. Ms Harris did not rely on any case law  or  other  decisions  of  this
      Tribunal.


      The respondent's case


  23. No material was placed before me  on  behalf  of  the  respondent.  Mr
      Melvin relied upon his written submissions, which he augmented orally.
      He submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant might be at
      risk of torture on his return. A distinction should  be  made  between
      the security services, the Criminal Investigations Department, and the
      civilian police. Only  the  latter  would  have  an  interest  in  the
      appellant for the purpose of  serving  the  sentence  imposed  in  his
      absence after due criminal process.  There  was  no  evidence  of  the
      police acting with impunity.


  24. Mr Melvin submitted that it was unlikely the  appellant  would  suffer
      any ill-treatment in completing his sentence. He referred  me  to  the
      2016 Country Report on Sri Lanka produced  by  the  US  Department  of
      State which recorded [p 12]:


         "Independent Monitoring: The Prison Welfare Society was the primary
         domestic organisation conducting visits  to  prisoners  and  has  a
         mandate in regulations to examine the conditions of  detention  for
         prisoners and negotiate their complaints with the individual prison
         superintendents and the commissioners of prisons.
         Improvements: The Prison Department sought to address  overcrowding
         by moving several prisons out of urban areas  into  more  spacious,
         rural locations. For example the  Department  moved  Jaffna  Prison
         outside of the city."


  25. Mr Melvin submitted that there was little evidence that the  appellant
      would suffer torture or extortion and that, if  required,  appropriate
      steps could be taken to negotiate safe passage into the prison  system
      via the  civilian  authorities.  Any  potential  difficulties  at  the
      airport would fall away.


  26. Mr Melvin rejected  the  suggestion  of  300%  overcrowding  and  drew
      attention to the establishment of newer prisons as evidenced by the US
      Department of State Report. He indicated  that  there  was  a  rolling
      programme  of  improvements  in  prisons  and  prison  conditions.  He
      submitted that the evidence did not bear  out  Ms  Harris'  contention
      that  conditions  had  worsened  since  the  Home  Office  Operational
      Guidance Notes of 2011.  He  drew  my  attention  to  the  Release  on
      Licence Scheme, the operation of which is set out in an academic paper
      included   in    the    appellant's    bundle    of    material:    J.
      Abeysirigunawardana, 'Overcrowded Prisons and  Present  Practices  and
      Experience   in   Relation   to   Community-Based   Alternatives    to
      Incarceration' [p 78].

  27. Mr Melvin noted that the appellant was  relatively  affluent  and  had
      retained a lawyer  to  represent  him  in  the  criminal  process.  He
      suggested that the appellant could use his wealth  to  ensure  he  was
      sent to one of the  better  prisons  and  to  secure  more  favourable
      treatment but, when directly questioned by me, conceded that there was
      no evidence before the Tribunal to  support  any  correlation  between
      affluence and deployment or treatment.


  28. Mr Melvin indicated that family visits  were  available,  the  Special
      Rapporteur recommending that they take place more frequently  [p  47].
      He took me to a number of parts of the  material  in  the  appellant's
      bundle: an information pack from the British High Commission,  Colombo
      for British prisoners in Sri Lanka (June 2015) states:


         "Conditions  within  prisons   are   difficult   because   of   the
         overcrowding and the heat. However, inmates do receive  appropriate
         medical attention and are provided with a balanced diet."


      The pack also records that a medical  practitioner  visits  all  penal
      institutions on a given date to attend the needs  of  prisoners.  More
      serious conditions are  referred  to  doctors  in  a  public  hospital
      outside the prison. [p 73].

  29. Mr Melvin's written submissions adopted paragraphs 40 et  set  of  the
      Respondent's Detailed Reasons for Refusal  of  Leave  annexed  to  the
      asylum decision letter of 4 August 2015. This recorded the regular use
      of  amnesties  authorising  the  release  of  various  categories   of
      prisoners on an ad hoc  basis  such  as  public  holidays.  Referring,
      amongst other things,  to  the  US  State  Department's  2014  Country
      Report, paragraph 45 asserted that there is  a  visible  effort  being
      made for those serving short jail sentences: whilst conditions differ,
      this does not constitute a breach of Article 3.


  30. Mr Melvin's written  submissions  were  that  GJ  and  Others  had  no
      application to the particular facts of this case  as  the  appellant's
      crime was non-political and had nothing  to  do  with  the  Liberation
      Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE): there was no risk of him  being  stopped
      at the airport in the circumstances envisaged. The  security  services
      will have no interest in him: the  arrest  warrant  is  a  matter  for
      civilian law enforcement not relating to political offending.


  31. Mr Melvin submitted that prison conditions in Sri  Lanka  are  not  so
      poor as to engage Article 3, and  that  old  infrastructure  is  being
      modernised, and overcrowding is being addressed. Steps are being taken
      to implement the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur [pp 46-47].
      He commente on overcrowding in United  Kingdom  prisons  with  inmates
      locked up all day not enjoying free association.


      Findings and conclusions


  32. The burden of proving a likely violation of  Article  3  lies  on  the
      appellant, and falls to be discharged on the balance of probabilities.
      Article 3 provides:


         "No one shall be subjected to torture or to  inhuman  or  degrading
         treatment or punishment."

  33. It must be established by the appellant that there  exist  substantial
      or serious grounds for believing that, if the  appellant  were  to  be
      returned to Sri Lanka, he would face a real risk of being subjected to
      torture or inhuman or  degrading  treatment.  Domestic  jurisprudence,
      together with that of the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights,  is  of
      limited utility in determining these matters  as  each  case  is  fact
      specific. Hence counsel, in my view wisely, did not cite case  law  in
      their submissions, save to acknowledge that  GJ  and  others  did  not
      assist as it  was  addressed  primarily  to  the  situation  of  Tamil
      activists.


  34. I note, by way of example only, the relatively recent judgment of  the
      Grand Chamber of the European  Court  of  Human  Rights  in  Mur?i?  v
      Croatia (Application no. 7334/13), judgment 20 October  2016.  In  the
      following paragraphs the Court comments on the considerations relevant
      to the assessment of whether a violation of Article 3 is made out.
       97. Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if  it  is
       to fall within the scope  of  Article  3.  The  assessment  of  this
       minimum is relative; it depends on  all  the  circumstances  of  the
       case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental
       effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of  the
       victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom,
       18 January 1978, � 162, Series A no. 25; Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no.
       54810/00, � 67, ECHR 2006-IX; Idalov, cited above, � 91;  and  also,
       Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, � 95, ECHR 2002-VI).
       98. Ill-treatment that attains such  a  minimum  level  of  severity
       usually involves actual bodily injury or intense physical or  mental
       suffering. However, even in the absence of  these,  where  treatment
       humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of  respect  for
       or diminishing his or her human  dignity,  or  arouses  feelings  of
       fear, anguish or inferiority capable  of  breaking  an  individual's
       moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as  degrading
       and also fall within the prohibition of Article 3 (see, among  other
       authorities, Idalov, cited above, � 92;  and  also,  Pretty  v.  the
       United Kingdom, no.  2346/02,  �  52,  ECHR  2002-III;  Ananyev  and
       Others, cited above, � 140; Varga and Others, cited  above,  �  70).
       Indeed,  the  prohibition  of  torture  and  inhuman  or   degrading
       treatment or punishment is a value of civilisation closely bound  up
       with respect for human dignity (see  Bouyid  v.  Belgium  [GC],  no.
       23380/09, � 81, ECHR 2015).
       99.  In  the  context  of  deprivation  of  liberty  the  Court  has
       consistently stressed that, to fall under Article 3,  the  suffering
       and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable
       element of suffering and humiliation connected with  detention.  The
       State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which  are
       compatible with respect for  human  dignity,  that  the  manner  and
       method of the execution of the measure do not subject him or her  to
       distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level
       of suffering inherent in detention and  that,  given  the  practical
       demands of imprisonment,  his  or  her  health  and  well-being  are
       adequately secured (see Kud?a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96,  ��  92-
       94,  ECHR  2000-XI;  Idalov,  cited  above,  �  93;  Svinarenko  and
       Slyadnev, cited above, � 116; Mozer v. the Republic of  Moldova  and
       Russia [GC], no. 11138/10, � 178, ECHR 2016; and also, Vala?inas  v.
       Lithuania, no. 44558/98, � 102,  ECHR  2001-VIII;  and  Ananyev  and
       Others, cited above, � 141).


  35. I am mindful that certain of the extracts relied upon by the appellant
      deploy terminology such as 'inhuman and degrading treatment'  adopting
      the vocabulary  of  Article  3.  This  Tribunal  cannot  abrogate  its
      function to third party opinion, however expert  and  experienced  its
      source. The objective assessment of specialist  international  bodies,
      NGOs and state authorities command due respect and are to be  afforded
      the weight they  deserve,  but  the  question  of  whether  there  are
      substantial or serious grounds for believing that the appellant  would
      face a real risk of torture  or  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  is
      ultimately one for me to determine having regard to  the  totality  of
      the  evidence  placed  before  me  and  the   particular   facts   and
      circumstances relating to the appellant.


  36. The cumulative effect of the material which I was invited to  consider
      is to the effect that prison conditions in Sri Lanka  are  undoubtedly
      harsh and there  is  considerable  overcrowding.  I  take  fully  into
      account that the  authorities  may  have  been  less  than  candid  or
      forthcoming in providing information to  international  agencies,  and
      that prisoners may have been discouraged from raising complaints  when
      afforded an opportunity to do so.


  37. The most severe criticism is directed  to  the  conditions  of  remand
      prisoners  or  individuals  undergoing  investigatory   process.   The
      appellant falls into neither category, having already  been  convicted
      and sentenced. In consequence it is  appropriate  to  disregard  those
      parts of the evidence.


  38. There is no  specific  evidence  as  to  the  treatment  of  convicted
      criminals upon their arrest in order to serve  a  sentence  which  has
      already been imposed and nothing to support argument by  analogy  from
      those being investigated by the authorities.  I can  find  nothing  in
      the material which even begins to discharge the burden of proof  which
      lies on the appellant in relation to this second limb  of  Ms  Harris'
      submissions under Article 3. The mere fact that the appellant would be
      taken into custody in order that he serve his sentence, would not,  in
      my assessment, amount  to  serious  grounds  for  believing  that  the
      appellant would face a real risk of torture or  inhuman  or  degrading
      treatment.


  39. The gravamen of this appeal, however, concerns  prison  conditions  in
      Sri Lanka generally. The respondent adduced  no  evidence  as  to  the
      particular prison or prisons where the appellant is  likely  to  serve
      his sentence, and it is therefore not open to the Tribunal to  proceed
      on the assumption  that  it  would  be  in  one  of  the  more  modern
      facilities  which  are  gradually  being  introduced.  Similarly,   Mr
      Melvin's submission that the appellant would be able to use his wealth
      to secure a place  at  a  better  institution  or  to  guarantee  more
      favourable treatment, is unsupported by any evidence  and  I  have  no
      hesitation in rejecting it.


  40. Taking the material as a whole, the following points seem  to  emerge.
      Undoubtedly prison conditions on Sri Lanka are  harsh  and  there  are
      significant levels of overcrowding. Nonetheless, the underlying  trend
      is of  improving  facilities  including  the  replacement  of  certain
      prisons with modern facilities.  There  is  a  lengthy  lead  time  in
      constructing  new  prisons  and  wholesale  replacement  remains  some
      considerable time away, measurable in years rather than months.


  41. There are medical facilities even in the older  prisons,  albeit  with
      limitations, and nutrition is  considered  to  be  adequate.  Sleeping
      conditions for prisoners are far from ideal and sanitary provision  is
      poor. There appear to be difficulties  in  relation  to  health  care,
      education,  vocational  training  and  recreational  activities.   The
      information pack provided by the British High  Commission  dated  June
      2015, however, gives a candid and balanced account. The evidence  also
      suggests that there is a possibility of release on licence so that the
      period of the appellant's actual incarceration may well be  less  that
      the three year sentence imposed.


  42.  Proceeding  on  the  basis  that  the  appellant  would  not  receive
      preferential treatment nor be allocated to one of  the  newer  prisons
      under construction, I am not satisfied that there are  substantial  or
      serious grounds for believing that the appellant  would  face  a  real
      risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment  while  serving  his
      prison sentence in Sri Lanka. Inevitably there will be a  high  degree
      of suffering and humiliation resulting from his  incarceration  in  an
      overcrowded  facility.  The  materials  before  me  suggest  that  the
      appellant's dignity will be sufficiently respected, not least  through
      medical care and family visits, however imperfect. There is nothing to
      suggest actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering.


  43. It therefore follows that I am  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant's
      return to Sri Lanka would constitute a violation  of  the  appellant's
      rights under Article 3 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.
      Accordingly his appeal under  this  ground  is  dismissed.  All  other
      grounds were dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal, and those  findings
      have been preserved.


Notice of Decision

The human rights ground which was before the First-tier Tribunal  is  remade
as follows:

   1) The appellant's appeal under Article 3 of the European  Convention  on
      Human Rights is dismissed;


   2) In consequence, and for the avoidance of doubt,  the  appeals  of  the
      second, third and fourth appellants are similarly dismissed.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellants and to the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                                  Appendix


                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal  from  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Fenoughty which was  promulgated  on  5  September  2016.   The  appeal
    concerns a citizen of Sri Lanka and  there  are  parasitic  appeals  in
    relation to his wife and their children.  The principal appellant (as I
    shall refer to him throughout this decision) pursued a claim for asylum
    and humanitarian relief arising out of his alleged involvement with the
    Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka.

2.   The decision in the First-tier Tribunal is  careful  and  detailed.  It
    recites what was contained in the refusal letter and then goes  through
    the evidence that was before the Tribunal, which is analysed with care.
     The judge  then  looks  at  the  issue  under  the  Immigration  Rules
    considering in turn asylum, humanitarian protection and  Article  3  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights.

3.   There are substantial concerns voiced in the First-tier Tribunal as  to
    the credibility of the appellant, including  a  number  of  significant
    inconsistencies within the evidence he gave  which  led  to  the  Judge
    rejecting all but one of the appellant's claims.  There is no challenge
    by way of cross-appeal in relation to the  judge's  disposal  of  these
    matters.

4.   Towards the conclusion of the  decision  the  judge  focuses  upon  the
    European Convention of Human Rights, and  as  I  observed  during  oral
    arguments this morning, the consideration of Article 3 is  surprisingly
    brief and cursory when set against the lengthy, detailed  and  thorough
    consideration which was given to the other aspects of this case.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted and  two  substantive  arguments  have
    been advanced before me which, it is submitted, both  individually  and
    collectively amount to material errors of law.

6.   The first is in respect of the  misapplication  by  the  judge  of  the
    decision in GJ and Others (post-civil  war:  returnees)  Sri  Lanka  CG
    [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC).  This judgment is discussed in paragraph 90 of
    the decision and certain paragraphs of the headnote are set out.

7.   The second matter raised is an alleged  failure  on  the  part  of  the
    judge to distinguish between  prison  conditions  which  may  apply  in
    relation to an  individuals  detained  pursuant  to  ordinary  criminal
    process and mistreatment by the security services in relation  to  LTTE
    activities.

8.   On both of these matters, the consideration  given  by  the  judge  was
    less than adequate.  There is no discussion of  the  detailed  material
    within GJ nor is there any reference to such evidence as may have  been
    before the First-tier Tribunal as to the state of prison conditions for
    criminals serving their sentence. Parties  in  immigration  proceedings
    are entitled to know the basis  upon  which  judicial  conclusions  are
    reached and, on these two material matters, they are singularly  absent
    from the decision.

9.   Miss Harris, on behalf of principal appellant,  submits  that  even  if
    there is one or more errors of law, they are not material because  were
    one to carry out the detailed analysis  of  the  country  guidance  and
    consider other relevant material,  it  would  lead  inevitably  to  the
    conclusion that the judge had made the proper findings.

10.  I do not consider that this is something which can  be  said  with  any
    degree of certainty. The only appropriate course is for this aspect  of
    the case to be looked at afresh and for the decision to  be  remade.  I
    will say nothing in this decision which might appear to  pre-judge  the
    outcome of that later hearing.

11.  In the circumstances I find material errors of  law  for  each  of  the
    reasons I have outlined above in relation to judge's  consideration  of
    Article 3. I preserve all the other findings  made  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The matter will be retained in the Upper  Tribunal  in  order
    that the decision on Article 3 can be remade. Such redetermination will
    be based upon such additional material as the Secretary  of  State  and
    the appellants may serve  and  file.   The  matter  will  be  adjourned
    accordingly.

Notice of Decision

i.   Having found  material  errors  of  law,  the  appeal  is  allowed  and
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside  in  relation  to  the
    consideration of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human  Rights.
    All other findings of the First-tier Tribunal are preserved.

ii.  Appeal adjourned for the decision on Article 3 to be remade.

iii. Matter to be relisted on the first open day after 10 weeks with a  time
    estimate of 1 day, before  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Hill  QC  if
    available.

iv.  Any additional evidence, to include expert  reports,  to  be  filed  no
    later than 14 days prior to the resumed hearing.
