                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.    The appellant and his family appealed the respondent's decision  dated
    11 April 2016 to refuse a human rights claim.

2.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Obhi dismissed  the  appeal  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 18 May 2017 because she  considered  that  it  would  be
    'reasonable' to expect the children to return to Libya even though "the
    country situation in some part of Libya is concerning" [30].

3.    The Upper Tribunal published the  country  guidance  decision  in  ZMM
    (Article 15(c)) Libya CG [2017] UKUT 263 on 28 June 2017. The  Tribunal
    concluded:

         "The  violence  in  Libya  has  reached  such  a  high  level  that
         substantial grounds  are  shown  for  believing  that  a  returning
         civilian would, solely on account of his presence on the  territory
         of that country or region, face a real risk of being subject  to  a
         threat to his life or person."

4.    The appellant was granted permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    in an order dated 30 November 2017.

5.    Further to directions dated 22 February 2018 the  respondent  provided
    the following response under rule 24 of The Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008.

         "In light of the UT's directions the SSHD has reviewed  the  detail
         of Judge Obhi's determination and accepts that there  are  material
         errors in respect of the  assessment  of  reasonableness  under  IR
         276ADE(1)(vi) and with respect to  the  assessment  of  exceptional
         circumstances [IR Gen.3.2.].

         In light of the case of ZMM, the SSHD also accepts that it would be
         unreasonable for the child Appellants to  leave  the  UK  and  that
         there are either very significant obstacles to the  integration  of
         the  adult  appellants  in  Libya  and/or  there  are   exceptional
         circumstances within the Rules.

         On that basis, the SSHD asks that the UT set aside the FtT decision
         and remake it, allowing the appeal of all Appellants in respect  of
         the ground of appeal open to them, that being s. 84(2) NIAA 2002."

6.    In light of the decision in ZMM the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  is
    unsustainable. Even though the appellant  did  not  argue  humanitarian
    protection grounds, the characterisation of the situation in  Libya  as
    "concerning" was clearly not  sufficient  in  terms  of  assessing  the
    situation that the children were likely to face if returned  to  Libya.
    Only a month later, the Upper Tribunal  concluded  that  the  level  of
    general  violence  was  such  that  it  reached   the   threshold   for
    humanitarian  protection  under  Article  15(c)  of  the  Qualification
    Directive.

7.    The respondent accepts that the decision in ZMM amounts  to  a  change
    in circumstances since the original decision was  made  to  refuse  the
    human rights claim. I am satisfied that, following the decision in ZMM,
    the First-tier Tribunal decision must be set aside and remade.

8.    The circumstances in Libya are such that they would  amount  to  'very
    significant obstacles' to integration under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  of
    the immigration rules in the case of  the  two  adult  appellants.  The
    children have lived in the UK for a continuous period of  seven  years.
    It is accepted that it would be 'unreasonable' to expect  the  children
    to leave the UK for the purpose of section 117B(6) of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("NIAA 2002") in light of the  decision
    in ZMM. In  the  alternative,  the  decision  in  ZMM  shows  that  the
    humanitarian circumstances in  Libya  are  sufficiently  compelling  to
    render a decision  to  remove  the  appellants  disproportionate  under
    Article 8 of the European Convention.

Direction

9.    The parties shall notify the Upper Tribunal by  4.00pm  today  whether
    they have any objection to the Upper Tribunal setting aside the  First-
    tier Tribunal decision or to it remaking and allowing  the  appeal  for
    the reasons set out above.

10.   If there is no  objection  to  this  proposed  course  of  action  the
    parties do not need to attend the hearing on 28 February 2018 and  this
    decision shall stand as the notice of decision.

DECISION

Subject to paragraph 9

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error of law

The decision is set aside

The appeal is ALLOWED on human rights grounds
