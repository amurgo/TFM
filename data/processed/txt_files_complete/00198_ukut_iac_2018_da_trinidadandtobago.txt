Representation:

For Mr Andell:   Mr D Sellwood instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
For the SSHD:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


Paragraph 398 of the Rules includes not only foreign  criminals  as  defined
in the 2002 Act and the 2007 Act but also other individuals who in the  view
of the Secretary of State,  are  liable  to  deportation  because  of  their
criminality and/or their offending behaviour.



                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. The issue in this case stems, in part, from the  definition  of  "a
        foreign criminal" in the UK Borders  Act  2007  ("2007  Act"),  the
        definition of that same phrase in the Nationality, Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 2002 ("2002 Act") and the  use  of  the  words  'foreign
        criminal' in the Immigration Rules ("the Rules"). In both the  2007
        Act and the 2002 Act a foreign criminal is defined as a person  who
        has been convicted and sentenced in the UK. In the Rules, there  is
        no requirement the criminal offence(s)  should  be  limited  to  UK
        convictions only.


        Outline immigration history


     2. Mr Andell is a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, born 31st May 1980.


     3. He arrived in the UK on 9th November 2015. He came to the attention
        of the UK authorities on 14th December 2015 when he was arrested on
        suspicion of having false documents. On 29th December 2015, he  was
        served with illegal entry paperwork dated 24th  December  2015.  On
        5th January 2016, he was  convicted  after  a  plea  of  guilty  to
        "possess/control identity documents with intent" and  sentenced  to
        10 months' imprisonment with a �100 victim surcharge.


     4. On 3rd March 2016 whilst in  detention  he  informed  the  SSHD  he
        wished to claim asylum; he was screened  on  22nd  March  2016  and
        underwent a substantive interview on 31st March 2016. On  3rd  June
        2016 Mr Andell was served with notice of liability  to  deportation
        dated 26th May 2016 and a s120 notice. The SSHD received an undated
        letter with enclosures from Mr Andell on 30th June 2016.  The  SSHD
        refused Mr Andell's protection and human rights claim  for  reasons
        set out in a letter dated 11th August 2016  and  these  proceedings
        are his appeal against that decision.

     5. His appeal against refusal of his protection and human rights claim
        was heard in the First-tier Tribunal on 5th January 2017  and,  for
        reasons set out in the decision promulgated on 16th  January  2017,
        First-tier  Tribunal  judge  Raikes   dismissed   his   appeal   on
        asylum/protection grounds and on human rights grounds.

   Convictions in Trinidad and Tobago

     6. In Trinidad and Tobago, Mr Andell was sentenced to 36  months  hard
        labour in 2012 following  a  conviction  for  'receiving'.  He  has
        received fines for disturbing the peace by fighting  and  making  a
        false report in 1998. According to the Trinidad and  Tobago  Police
        Service Criminal  Records  Office  document,  Mr  Andell  had  been
        charged with other offences for which he was 'discharged'.


     7. There remain a number of pending charges against  him  in  Trinidad
        and Tobago including 'buggery' (11 October 2011); kidnapping ransom
        (10 October  2008);  buggery  (10  October  2008)  grievous  sexual
        assault (10 October 2008)  Disorderly  behaviour  (9  March  2006);
        larceny (29 November 2000). It is  not  clear  why  some  of  those
        charges were not dealt with by the criminal courts at the same time
        as other charges were heard and resulted either  in  conviction  or
        discharge. It is important to bear  in  mind  that  these  are  not
        convictions. They have not, correctly, been taken into  account  by
        the SSHD in determining whether Mr Andell is  a  foreign  criminal;
        they are not relevant to the question of whether he  is  a  foreign
        criminal.


        Decision to deport

     8. On 26th May 2016, the SSHD decided  to  make  a  deportation  order
        against Mr Andell under s5(1) Immigration Act 1971. The reasons for
        the decision to deport are set out in the decision dated  26th  May
        2016 (no appeal). This states, where relevant:


             Reasons for deportation


             On 21 September 2012 at Port  of  Spain  Magistrate  Court  in
             Trinidad & Tobago, you were convicted of receiving, for  which
             you were sentenced to 3 years imprisonment.
             You also have 1 conviction for 2 offences in Trinidad & Tobago
             on 13 August 1998 and 1 conviction for 1 offence in the UK  on
             05 January  2016.  As  a  result  of  your  criminality,  your
             deportation is considered to be conducive to the  public  good
             and as such  you  are  liable  to  deportation  by  virtue  of
             s3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971.
             Paragraph 396 of the Immigration Rules (as  amended)  provides
             that there is a presumption that the public interest  requires
             the deportation of a person  who  is  liable  to  deportation.
             Therefore the  Secretary  of  State  has  decided  to  make  a
             deportation order against you under s5(1) of  the  Immigration
             Act 1971.


     9. In her decision to refuse the protection  and  human  rights  claim
        dated 26 May 2016 (the appeal against which is the subject of these
        proceedings), the SSHD states:


             Reasons for deportation
             7. On 5 January 2016 at Luton Crown Court you  were  convicted
             of  possess/control  identify  documents   with   intent   and
             sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment and to  pay  �100  victim
             surcharge.
             8. In addition to the above conviction received in the  UK  it
             is noted that you have previously been convicted of  receiving
             (indictable offence) sec 35(1) in Trinidad & Tobago, in  2012,
             for which you were sentenced to 36 months'  hard  labour.  You
             have also received convictions for the offences of  disturbing
             the peace by fighting and making false  report  in  1998,  for
             which you received fines. In light of these convictions,  your
             continued presence in the UK is not considered to  be  in  the
             public interest. There are also a number of impending  charges
             against you in your country of origin and a  warrant  out  for
             your arrest.
             ....
             83. Your deportation is conducive to the public  good  and  in
             the public interest because you  have  been  convicted  of  an
             offence  which  has  caused  serious  harm/are  a   persistent
             offender. This is because you were sentenced in  your  country
             of origin for the offence of 'receiving' which  is  considered
             as a serious harm offence in  light  of  the  sentence  handed
             down, namely 36 months hard labour. It is also noted that  you
             have two other previous convictions and a  number  of  pending
             charges  outstanding  against  you  in  Trinidad  and   Tobago
             (including 2 counts of buggery,  kidnapping,  grievous  sexual
             assault from 2008) and have received a conviction  in  the  UK
             almost immediately following your arrival here.  Therefore  in
             accordance with paragraph 398 of the  Immigration  Rules,  the
             public interest requires your deportation unless an  exception
             to  deportation  applies.  The  exceptions  are  set  out   in
             paragraphs 399 and 399A Immigration Rules.

    10. The Immigration Rules, in so far as relevant to this  appeal,  read
        as follows:

             Deportation and Article 8


             A398. These rules apply where:
              (a) a foreign criminal liable to deportation claims that his
             deportation would be contrary to the United Kingdom's
             obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;
             (b) a foreign criminal applies for a deportation order made
             against him to be revoked.


             398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be
             contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human
             Rights Convention, and
                  (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive
                  to the public good and in the public interest because they
                  have been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;


                  (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive
                  to the public good and in the public interest because they
                  have been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years
                  but at least 12 months; or
                  (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive
                  to the public good and in the public interest because,  in
                  the view of the Secretary of State,  their  offending  has
                  caused serious harm or they are a persistent offender  who
                  shows a particular disregard for the law,
             the Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider
             whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the
             public interest in deportation  will  only  be  outweighed  by
             other factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances
             over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.


    11. There was no challenge to the conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal
        judge that Mr Andell did not meet Exception 1 or 2  in  either  the
        Rules or s117C 2002 Act - he has no wife or partner  or  qualifying
        child.

Permission to appeal

    12. Mr Andell was given permission to appeal the decision of the First-
        tier Tribunal on 4 grounds:
        a) It was arguable the judge had failed to have adequate regard  to
           a country expert on conditions in prison in Trinidad and Tobago;
        b) It was arguable the  judge  had  failed  to  apply  the  correct
           standard of proof in the light of past persecution;
        c) It was arguable the judge had failed to take  into  account  the
           medical evidence when determining Mr Andell's credibility; and
        d) It was arguable there were procedural defects  in  the  decision
           regarding the human rights claim  such  that  the  decision  was
           unlawful.

    13. The SSHD was granted permission to appeal on 6 grounds:
        a) It was arguable there was procedural unfairness  in  reaching  a
           finding that the appellant was not a foreign criminal as defined
           by s117D(2) Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002;
        b) It was arguable the findings  relating  to  persistent  offender
           and/or caused serious harm were obiter and there was no  finding
           that the underlying deportation order was unlawful;
        c) It was arguable, having allegedly  failed  to  seek  the  SSHD's
           views on persistent offender/serious harm, the  judge  ought  to
           have considered  publicly  available  documents  containing  the
           SSHD's policy in relation to these issues;
        d) It was arguable the combined failure of the First-tier  Tribunal
           Judge to have regard to guidance and  to  fail  to  canvass  the
           issue at the  hearing  has  resulted  in  inadequately  reasoned
           findings. It was arguable the judge failed  to  have  regard  to
           both the three-year  sentence  in  Trinidad  and  the  10  month
           sentence in the UK.
        e) It was arguable the judge was  simply  wrong  to  find  that  Mr
           Andell had not been convicted of an offence that caused  serious
           harm; and
        f)  It  was  arguable  the  judge  did  not  have  jurisdiction  to
           substitute her own decision for that made by the SSHD where  the
           SSHD has made a decision under s3(5)(a) Immigration Act 1971.


    14. I heard submissions from both parties on  13th  November  2017  and
        adjourned part heard to enable  both  parties  to  file  and  serve
        written submissions on:


            What is the effect of a finding  that  an  individual  has  not
            caused serious harm and is not a persistent offender  where  the
            deportation proceedings were issued on the  basis  that  he  had
            caused serious harm and/or was a persistent offender;


            What is the relevance of the third question in Razgar ie is the
            decision in accordance with the law.


        Grounds of appeal by Mr Andell: 12(a) to (c) above


    15. Mr Deller was correct to accept that the First-tier Tribunal  judge
        had materially erred in law in failing to have adequate  regard  to
        the medical evidence, the expert report and country evidence relied
        upon by the appellant in reaching his decision that Mr  Andell  was
        not at risk of being persecuted if removed to Trinidad and  Tobago.
        This was not only because of the evidence of prison conditions  but
        also the underlying claim of being targeted. It follows that I  set
        aside the decision  that  Mr  Andell  was  not  at  risk  of  being
        persecuted. The decision is to be remade, no findings retained.




        Were there procedural defects in the human rights  decision  (12(d)
        above).


    16. Mr Selwood in written submissions relied upon Greenwood No 2  (para
        398 considered) [2015] UKUT 00629 (IAC) and submitted that where it
        was established that the decision of the SSHD was not in accordance
        with the law, there remained a 'not in  accordance  with  the  law'
        jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the decision should be remitted to
        the Secretary of State for a lawful decision to be taken. Before me
        on 12th March 2018, both parties  had  a  copy  of  Charles  (human
        rights appeal: scope) [2018] UKUT 00089 (IAC) which  at  that  time
        was unreported. I informed the parties that it was  likely  that  a
        decision on whether Charles was going to be reported  may  be  made
        within the following couple of weeks and agreed with them that they
        were at  liberty  to  make  written  submissions  on  the  'not  in
        accordance with the law' point within seven days  if  they  wished.
        Charles was reported on 19th March 2018 and neither party has  made
        any submissions. I have proceeded as set  out  in  Charles,  namely
        that it is no longer possible for the Tribunal to allow  an  appeal
        on the ground that a decision is not in accordance with the law and
        to that extent Greenwood No 2 should not be followed.

    17. As Charles explains, if an  appellant  has  any  criticism  of  the
        Secretary of State's decision making under  the  Rules  or  various
        Immigration Acts, s/he will, if the  circumstances  engage  Article
        8(2), be able to advance those criticisms in the Article  8  appeal
        and, specifically  when  considering  the  proportionality  of  the
        decision.

    18. I have found that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  its
        consideration of Mr Andell's  protection  and  human  rights  claim
        appeal and the decision on  those  elements  is  set  aside  to  be
        remade. It is not necessary for me to establish whether there  were
        procedural defects in the decision(s) by the SSHD.  If  there  were
        procedural defects in the decision(s) of  the  SSHD,  they  can  be
        considered when the First-Tier Tribunal re-determines the appeal.


        Grounds of appeal by the SSHD

    19. These are, in  essence,  whether  the  finding  by  the  First-tier
        Tribunal judge that Mr  Andell  was  not  a  foreign  criminal  was
        infected by a material error of law.  There  are  two  elements  to
        this: firstly, whether there is,  as  submitted  by  Mr  Deller,  a
        contradiction between the approach to be taken to paragraph  398(c)
        of   the   Immigration   Rules   which   refers    to    persistent
        offending/serious harm being "in  the  view  of  the  Secretary  of
        State"  and  the  definition  of  foreign  criminal   including   a
        persistent offender or someone causing serious harm to be found  in
        Part 5A Nationality Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   Secondly
        whether, in this particular case,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
        erred in law in his finding  that  Mr  Andell  was  not  a  foreign
        criminal.








        Is there a contradiction?


    20. The SSHD is required to make a deportation order (s32(5) UK Borders
        Act 2007) if an individual is a  foreign  criminal  as  defined  in
        ss32(1), (2) and (3) of the 2007 Act[1]. Mr Andell is not a foreign
        criminal as so defined. 'Foreign criminal' is defined in s117D  for
        the purpose of Part 5A (my emphasis) of the 2002 Act and, in so far
        as is relevant to Mr Andell, reads as follows

             117D (2)In this Part, "foreign criminal" means a person-
                  (a)who is not a British citizen,
                  (b)who has been convicted in the United Kingdom of an
             offence, and
                  (c)who-
                      (i)has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of
                  at least 12 months,
                      (ii)has been convicted of an offence that has caused
                   serious harm, or
                      (iii)is a persistent offender.


    21. The definition of a foreign criminal for the purpose  of  s117D  of
        the 2002 Act therefore includes a person who is a foreign  criminal
        as defined by s32(2) of the 2007 Act. S117C of the  2002  Act  sets
        out the additional matters  to  be  taken  into  account  where  an
        individual is a foreign criminal (as defined in the  2002  Act)  in
        deciding whether the deportation would breach the UK's  obligations
        under Article 8.


    22. The Immigration Rules, ss117A-D of the  2002  Act  and  the  SSHD's
        various policies and guidance set out the various matters that  are
        to be taken into account when considering the proportionality of  a
        decision to grant or refuse a human  rights  claim.  In  accordance
        with s5(1) Immigration Act 1971 ("1971 Act"),  where  a  person  is
        liable to deportation under s3(5) or (6) of the 1971 Act  the  SSHD
        may make a deportation order against him. s3(5), in so  far  as  is
        relevant to Mr Andell reads as follows


         A person who is not a British Citizen is liable to deportation from
        the United Kingdom if -
         a) The Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive  to
            the public good;
         b) ...


    23. The decision whether to make a deportation  order  against  someone
        who is not a 'foreign criminal' as defined in the 2002 Act  or  the
        2007 Act is a decision to be taken by the SSHD.  That  decision  is
        not predicated upon the individual  being  a  foreign  criminal  as
        defined in the 2002 Act or the 2007 Act but is  a  decision  to  be
        taken by the SSHD on the basis  that  she  deems  the  individual's
        deportation to be conducive to the public good.  That  decision  by
        the SSHD is not amenable to challenge in a statutory appeal but, as
        per Charles (see [17]  above)  any  alleged  deficiencies  in  that
        decision can be addressed in  the  human  rights  statutory  appeal
        rather than by way of parallel judicial review proceedings.

    24. Paragraph 398(c) Immigration Rules refers to "in the  view  of  the
        Secretary of State". Mr Deller submitted that it seemed this  could
        not be challenged in a statutory appeal, only by  way  of  judicial
        review. He acknowledged however that this  appeared  to  contradict
        Chege ("is a persistent offender")  [2016]  UKUT  187  (IAC)  which
        confirms that it is open to the Tribunal, in a statutory appeal, to
        consider for itself whether an individual is a persistent  offender
        or has caused serious harm.  It is unsatisfactory if this  apparent
        contradiction does in fact exist and if so  for  it  to  result  in
        parallel proceedings; it would result  in  considerable  delay  and
        cost both to the individual and to the public purse.

    25. But this is to confuse the use of the words "foreign  criminal"  in
        the context in which it is used. In the context of the 2007 Act  it
        is a term of art which requires certain criteria to  be  fulfilled.
        Similarly, in the 2002 Act it is a term of art, but with  different
        criteria. In the Immigration Rules which are not  to  be  construed
        with the same exactitude as a statute but as an expression  of  the
        SSHD's policy, they are simply words denoting that a  person  is  a
        criminal and a foreigner.

    26. I do not however take the view that there is a contradiction.

        a) If an individual has committed crimes which bring him within the
           2007 Act, he is a foreign criminal for the purpose of the making
           of an automatic deportation order;
        b) If an individual meets s117D (2) (which will include  those  who
           are foreign criminals as defined by s32(2) of the 2007 Act),  he
           is a foreign criminal and his appeal will include  consideration
           by the Tribunal of the matters set out in s117C;
        c) If the Secretary of  State  has  decided  that  an  individual's
           deportation  is  conducive  to  the  public  good  (a  1971  Act
           deportation decision), whether or not he has been convicted of a
           criminal offence, the Rules govern the approach to be  taken  in
           the human rights appeal.


    27. The Rules cover, in a designated section, deportation  and  Article
        8. Paragraph A398  of  the  Rules  refers  to  "foreign  criminal".
        Paragraph 398 of the Rules refers to "a person". It  must  be  that
        the word person includes  not  only  individuals  who  are  foreign
        criminals as defined in the 2002 Act and the  2007  Act  but  other
        individuals who, in the view of the SSHD, are liable to deportation
        under the 1971 Act. This will include  "foreigners"  who  are  also
        "criminals". Paragraph 398 of the Rules imports the language of the
        2002 Act and thus the consideration to be undertaken  in  assessing
        the UK's  obligations  under  Article  8.  The  2007  Act  and  the
        Immigration Act 2014 which amended the 2002 Act  are  a  deliberate
        legislative  intention  to  distinguish  between  those   who   are
        convicted of criminal offences in the UK and  those  who  are  not.
        S117C of the 2002 Act applies only to those convicted of an offence
        in the UK and meet the other criteria in s117D of the 2002 Act.


    28. On the face of it, it appears the Rules have sought to  reintroduce
        a deportation mechanism for individuals who are not caught  by  the
        2007 and 2002 Acts. But that is to ignore the continuing discretion
        of the SSHD to take a decision to deport an  individual  under  the
        1971 Act. It is unsurprising that the SSHD, in deciding whether  an
        individual is liable to deportation under the 1971 Act, should draw
        upon the legislative intention relating to  UK  convictions.  Hence
        the deportation section in the Rules is not only concerned with  UK
        convictions but also convictions abroad (paragraphs 398(a) and  (b)
        of the Rules). This must include consideration of s117C of the 2002
        Act in determining the appeal against the rejection  of  the  human
        rights claim. The assessment  in  a  human  rights  appeal  by  the
        Tribunal  will  include,  as  per  Charles,  consideration  of  any
        submissions regarding the  SSHD's  decision,  including  whether  a
        conviction  abroad  with  a  sentence  of  more  than   12   months
        imprisonment would be comparably treated in the UK.

    29. Paragraph 398(c) does not refer to convictions  but  to  offending.
        This appears to be a deliberate  distinction  from  criminality  as
        evidenced by conviction. There is no  requirement  for  a  criminal
        conviction; it is the SSHD's view as to whether  the  behaviour  is
        such  as  caused  serious  harm  or  amounts  to  being  persistent
        offending. This  approach  chimes  with  the  concept  of  a  broad
        discretion  available  to  the  SSHD;  the  discretion  to  take  a
        deportation decision under the 1971 Act.


    30.  In SC (Zimbabwe) [2018] EWCA Civ 929, the Court of Appeal  doubted
        the approach taken in LT(Kosovo), DC (Jamaica) [2016] EWCA Civ 1246
        which referred to the significant weight  to  be  attached  to  the
        Secretary of State's view  of  "serious  harm".  In  SC  (Zimbabwe)
        McCombe LJ  said [19]


           "....It seems to me quite  clear  that  once  the  matter  comes
           before a tribunal or court, what has to be applied is  s.117D(c)
           of the Act....the view of the Secretary of State or indeed of  a
           judge in sentencing remarks may be of assistance to  a  Tribunal
           or court in deciding whether an offence has caused serious  harm
           or whether an offender is a persistent offender, but  I  do  not
           see that the statutory words compel any particular weight to  be
           given to  the  Secretary  of  State's  view  on  either  in  the
           assessment..."


    31. It is open to a First-tier Tribunal judge, on the  evidence  before
        him/her  to  reach  a  decision  on  whether  an  individual  is  a
        persistent offender or has caused serious harm such as to bring him
        within s117D 2002 Act - see Chege. Where  an  individual  does  not
        fall within the 2002 Act or 2007 Act definition of foreign criminal
        but the SSHD has taken a decision under the 1971 Act, her  decision
        and her view as to the circumstances that led her to that  decision
        are matters that will be considered by the Tribunal in  determining
        the proportionality of the human rights decision - see Charles  and
        SC (Zimbabwe).

        Is there an error of law by the First-tier Tribunal in  finding  Mr
        Andell is not a foreign criminal.


    32. The issue of whether Mr Andell was or was not  a  foreign  criminal
        was not, it is submitted by the SSHD, canvassed at  the  First-tier
        Tribunal hearing. The presenting officer's note of proceedings  has
        not been produced; it does not  seem  from  the  skeleton  argument
        relied upon by Mr Andell  at  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
        Tribunal that it was submitted by him that he  was  not  a  foreign
        criminal. The decisions of the SSHD which have led to  the  appeal,
        refer to  Mr  Andell  being  a  persistent  offender/having  caused
        serious harm. It is not therefore a matter that the SSHD would have
        been unable to address before the First-tier Tribunal had  it  been
        raised. It is not apparent on the face of  the  determination  that
        the issue was live before the judge. The conclusions of the  First-
        tier Tribunal have been very ably addressed by both representatives
        before me. Mr Deller did not pursue this ground of appeal with  any
        great vigour, relying predominantly on the  issue  of  whether  the
        First-tier Tribunal had erred in finding Mr  Andell  not  to  be  a
        foreign criminal, the relevance of the SSHD's opinion that  he  was
        and the consequences.


    33. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found:


             49. It is clear that [Mr Andell] cannot  be  viewed  to  be  a
             persistent  offender  in  the  UK  alone,  having  only   been
             convicted of one offence here which resulted  in  imprisonment
             of less than 12  months.  In  respect  of  serious  harm,  the
             Secretary of State appears to be relying on  a  conviction  of
             receiving from Trinidad and Tobago  of  which  I  have  little
             detail presented to me, other than a summary form the Criminal
             Records Office.  It  is  unclear  from  the  refusal  decision
             whether the Secretary of State has formed  the  view,  in  her
             discretion, and  based  on  his  offending  in  the  UK,  that
             paragraph 398(c) of the Rules applies in  respect  of  serious
             harm  and  therefore  the   public   interest   requires   his
             deportation unless one of the exceptions applies. I note  that
             the Secretary of State went on to consider  the  private  life
             exception under 399A and found it did not  apply.  However,  I
             cannot on the basis of the contents of  the  refusal  decision
             and the conclusions in there establish whether  the  Secretary
             of State has or has not formed the view that 398(c) did apply.
             50. Having come to this conclusion, in  deciding  whether  the
             decision breaches [Mr Andell's] rights under Article 8 ECHR, I
             have taken into account Sections 117A to 117D and  the  public
             interest considerations relating to this.


        The First-tier Tribunal Judge then  considered  the  definition  of
        'foreign criminal" in s117D (2) of the Nationality Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 2002 and found:


             53. Given the nature of [Mr Andell's] offending  behaviour  in
             the UK and the conviction which was for a period of less  than
             twelve months, I cannot be satisfied that  [Mr  Andell]  is  a
             foreign criminal as defined by  Section  117C  [sic].  I  have
             therefore in the alternative gone on to consider [Mr Andell's]
             Article 8  claim  under  the  public  interest  considerations
             applicable in all cases contained in s117B of  the  NIAA  2002
             and also paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules,  on  the
             basis of his private life only as [Mr Andell] has  not  sought
             to raise any issue under family life.
             ....


    34. Dealing first with the First-tier Tribunal Judge's conclusion  that
        Mr Andell is not a persistent offender, it is difficult to  see  on
        what basis the First-tier Tribunal Judge  reached  that  conclusion
        other than by considering only the offence committed in the UK.  It
        is of course to be remembered that  this  appeal  arises  from  the
        refusal of a human rights/protection claim  made  subsequent  to  a
        decision to deport  under  the  1971  Act,  not  subsequent  to  an
        automatic deportation order under the 2007 Act. There has  been  no
        analysis by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  of  the  impact  of  Mr
        Andell's convictions in Trinidad  &  Tobago  on  whether  he  is  a
        persistent offender. The most recent  conviction  in  Trinidad  and
        Tobago was 2012 with a sentence of 36 months. During that  time  in
        prison he would be unable to commit any  further  offences  outside
        prison in society. It cannot be otherwise than that convictions  in
        another country should be taken into account in determining whether
        an individual is a persistent offender. The SSHD plainly  took  the
        view - see extract from decision letter at  [8]  above  -  that  Mr
        Andell was a  persistent  offender  and  reached  her  decision  to
        deport, in part, on that basis. The First-tier Tribunal  judge  did
        not address this at all but, in reaching a decision that he is  not
        a foreign  criminal  considered  only  the  length  of  his  prison
        sentence and his conviction in the UK - see extract from First-tier
        Tribunal decision at [33] above. It may well be that  a  conclusion
        that Mr Andell is not a persistent offender is correct. Some of the
        offences he was convicted of in Trinidad are very old and there  is
        little information about the nature of the  offences  or  what  has
        happened to the outstanding charges. Nevertheless,  the  First-tier
        Tribunal judge has materially erred in law in only considering  the
        UK conviction to  establish  whether  Mr  Andell  is  a  persistent
        offender; he therefore failed to carry out the assessment required.


    35. In so far as whether Mr Andell's offence in the UK  caused  serious
        harm, the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not  address  this  at  all
        other than to comment that the Secretary of State  appeared  to  be
        relying upon the conviction in  Trinidad  and  Tobago  to  identify
        serious harm. The judge did not  reach  his  own  decision  despite
        having earlier referred to Chege (is a persistent offender)  [2016]
        UKUT 187 (IAC).  Although  it  might  have  been  helpful  had  the
        Secretary of State set out exactly which  offences  she  considered
        fell  within  "serious  harm",  which   fell   within   "persistent
        offending" and which were both, Mr Andell knew  what  he  had  been
        convicted  of,  knew  the  Secretary  of   State   considered   his
        deportation to be conducive to the public good  because  he  was  a
        persistent offender/caused serious harm and it was plainly open  to
        him to object to that classification.

    36. The failure of the First-tier Tribunal judge to address  the  issue
        of serious harm, a reason given  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for
        finding Mr Andell's deportation to be conducive to the public good,
        is a material error of law.

    37. The SSHD decision letters refer to both  persistent  offending  and
        serious harm. It is clear that the decision has been taken  because
        of Mr Andell's offending behaviour. The SSHD makes reference to the
        convictions in Trinidad and Tobago and to the UK conviction. It  is
        plain  that  the  SSHD  took  the  view  that  these  matters  were
        sufficient to require his deportation.


    38. The First-tier Tribunal judge, in considering whether Mr Andell was
        a persistent offender and failing to consider whether he had caused
        serious harm, failed to consider the Secretary of State's view. The
        First-tier Tribunal judge materially erred in law.

    39. Each of the above errors are material to the outcome of the appeal.
        If the First-tier Tribunal judge did in fact fail to raise with the
        parties that he was considering whether Mr Andell was in any  event
        a foreign criminal, that is also a material error of law.

    40. It follows that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal with regard
        to the finding that  Mr  Andell  was  not  a  foreign  criminal  is
        materially legally flawed and I set it aside to be remade.

        Consideration of Mr Andell's private life consequent to the finding
        that he is not a foreign criminal.


    41. Although I have set aside the First-tier Tribunal decision that the
        appellant  is  not  a  foreign  criminal  I  have  considered   the
        submission by Mr  Selwood  that  the  approach  by  the  First-tier
        Tribunal judge, having found  that  Mr  Andell  is  not  a  foreign
        criminal as defined in Part 5A of the 2002  Act,  to  then  take  a
        decision under the administrative removal process  in  a  conducive
        deportation case  is  problematic  because  the  deportation  order
        remains in place.


    42. That is not the case. There is, so  far  as  I  can  ascertain,  no
        deportation order. As �101 of the decision to refuse the protection
        and human rights claim (the 11th August 2016 decision) makes clear

             If you do  not  appeal,  or  you  appeal  and  the  appeal  is
             unsuccessful, or your human rights claim  is  later  certified
             under s94B of the 2002  Act,  a  deportation  order  will  (my
             emphasis) be made against you  and  you  will  be  removed  to
             Trinidad & Tobago.


        Although the previous legislative  regime  whereby  an  appeal  lay
        against the decision to make a  deportation  order  has  ceased  to
        exist, where a decision to deport on conducive  grounds,  ie  under
        the 1971 Act, is made, the deportation order is  not  signed  until
        the appeal rights on the protection  and  human  rights  claim  are
        exhausted.   In  this  case,  there  was  a  decision  to  make   a
        deportation order on conducive grounds under the  1971  Act  but  a
        deportation order has not been signed. Mr  Andell's  appeal  rights
        are continuing.

    43. As explained above, if an individual is not a foreign  criminal  as
        defined in the 2002 Act or the 2007 Act, that does  not  prevent  a
        decision to deport being taken under the 1971  Act;  paragraph  398
        applies to such decisions. The First-tier  Tribunal  judge  further
        materially erred in law in addressing the deportation of Mr  Andell
        under  s117B  of  the  2002   Act   (the   administrative   removal
        provisions), having failed to reach a lawful decision on whether Mr
        Andell was a persistent offender or had caused serious harm.


    44. Mr Andell's  appeal  is  an  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  his
        protection and human rights claim. It is not an  appeal  against  a
        decision to deport or a  deportation  order  or  an  administrative
        removal decision. Whether an individual is a foreign criminal is  a
        factor that is taken into account in reaching  a  decision  on  the
        appeal, as are any criminal  convictions  or  offending  behaviour,
        even if an individual is not a foreign criminal as defined  in  the
        2002 Act or the 2007 Act.

        Summary of conclusions

    45.  Drawing this together:


        a) A decision by the Secretary of State to make a deportation order
           under the 1971 Act is not predicated upon an individual being a
           "foreign criminal" as defined by the 2002 Act or the 2007 Act.
        b) "Foreign criminal" is a term of art in the 2002 Act and the 2007
           Act whereas in the Rules the words simply denote that the
           individual is a "foreigner" and a "criminal".
        c) Paragraph 398 of the Rules includes not only foreign criminals
           as defined in the 2002 Act and the 2007 Act but also other
           individuals who in the view of the Secretary of State, are
           liable to deportation because of their criminality and/or their
           offending behaviour.
        d) A human rights appeal will include consideration of submissions
           regarding the Secretary of State's decision relating to
           convictions abroad, offending behaviour and alleged procedural
           defects.




        Decision

    46. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve
        the making of material errors on points of  law  such  that  I  set
        aside the decision in its entirety, no findings preserved.


    47. The scheme of the Tribunals Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not
        assign the function of primary fact finding to the Upper Tribunal.


    48. When I have set  aside  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
        s.12(2) of the TCEA 2007 requires me to remit the case to the First-
        tier Tribunal with directions or re-make it  for  myself.  In  this
        case the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
        necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
        such that,  having  regard  to  the  overriding  objective,  it  is
        appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.
