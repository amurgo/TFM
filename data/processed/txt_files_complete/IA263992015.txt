Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E TUFAN, (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    MR C MAHFUZ, (Counsel)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant in this matter is the Secretary  of  State  and  I  shall
    refer to the parties as "the Secretary of State" and to Mrs [A] as "the
    Claimant".  This is an error of law  hearing  that  comes before me for
    consideration as to whether or not there is a material error of law  in
    the decision the First-Tier Tribunal (Judge  Wyman)("FtT")  promulgated
    on 4th July 2016 in which the FtT allowed  the  appeal  under  the  EEA
    (Immigration ) Regulations 2006 ("EEA Regs") following  a  decision  to
    refuse her a residence card.

Background

2.   The Claimant is a citizen of Nigeria and she married a  Dutch  national
    on  12th  March  2015.   The  Claimant  provided  evidence   with   her
    application for a residence  card  as  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national exercising Treaty rights, which included wage  slips,  divorce
    certificate, utility bills and passports.  The Claimant and her husband
    were interviewed on 1sts June 2015.

3.   The Secretary of State refused the application on the grounds that  the
    marriage was one of convenience under Regulation 2 EEA Regs. and relied
    on the five significant discrepancies  in  the  answers  given  by  the
    parties in the marriage interview which were set  out  in  the  refusal
    letter.

FtT decision

4.   The decision referred to the standard of proof as being the balance  of
    probabilities [13]. The FtT heard oral evidence from the  Claimant  and
    her spouse which focused on the discrepancies in the interview  [20-45]
    and the  FtT  put  additional  questions  to  the  witnesses.  The  FtT
    proceeded on the basis that there were 3 significant  discrepancies  in
    issue. At [57] the FtT referred to the standard of  proof  as  being  a
    "low one"  and  stated  "Whilst  I  acknowledge  that  there  are  some
    inconsistencies in the evidence  provided  by  the  couple,  there  are
    enough answers that are similar to make me satisfied that this is not a
    marriage of convenience and that the couple are  indeed  in  a  genuine
    relationship."

Grounds of application for permission

5.   The Secretary of State appealed on the grounds that the FtT  failed  to
    give adequate reasons for its  decision.   It  was  accepted  that  the
    discrepancy as to the date of the marriage was an error on the part  of
    the respondent.  However, it was argued that in light of the number  of
    significant discrepancies the FtT failed to give  proper  reasons.   It
    was argued that the FtT may well have applied a standard of proof  that
    was too low given the reference to a "low one".

Permission

6.   Permission was granted on the grounds  that  the  FtT  having  noted  a
    particularly  significant  discrepancy,  appeared  to  have  applied  a
    different standard of proof.

7.   There was no Rule 24 response produced.

Submissions

8.   Mr Tufan submitted that the refusal cited only the  main  discrepancies
    and that there were others.  The FtT had not grappled with the issue of
    the burden and standard of proof in marriage cases,  as  there  was  no
    reference to the initial burden on the  Secretary  of  State,  nor  the
    shift as outlined in Re B (Children) 2008 UKHL 35.   The  FtT  had  not
    given  adequate  reasons  for  its  decision  given   the   number   of
    discrepancies and it seemed that the FtT had applied a  lower  standard
    than the balance of probabilities. It was not correct that  there  were
    only 5 discrepancies as the refusal letter focused on the main ones.

9.   Mr Mafuz contended that the FtT had applied  the  correct  standard  of
    proof as stated at [13]. The significant discrepancies were  considered
    by the FtT and in the context of there having been 192 questions put to
    the couple in the  interviews.   The  parties  had  given  correct  and
    consistent answers to many questions put to them.  The  FtT  considered
    the evidence as a whole and the standard was a low one.

Discussion and conclusion

10.  In reading the decision  as  a  whole  I  am  satisfied  that  the  FtT
    properly considered  all  of  the  evidence  and  applied  the  correct
    standard of proof.  In Ali v SSHD 2006 EWCA Civ 484  the  CA  confirmed
    that the correct standard of proof when deciding whether a couple  were
    married for the purposes of EEC law was the normal civil standard of  a
    balance of probabilities. In Rosa [2016] EWCA Civ 14 it was  held  that
    the Secretary of  State  had  the  legal  burden  of  proving  that  an
    otherwise valid marriage was a marriage of convenience so as to justify
    refusing an application for a residence card. If the Secretary of State
    adduced evidence capable  of  suggesting  that  the  marriage  was  not
    genuine, the evidential burden shifted to the applicant.

11.  In reaching its decision the FtT in particular  placed  weight  on  the
    consistent answers given  by  the  parties  to  questions  put  by  the
    Tribunal.  The FtT set out in detail those matters that  were  answered
    correctly and those that were not correct.  The  FtT  referred  to  the
    correct standard of proof, the balance of probabilities albeit  without
    detailing the nuanced approach for marriages of convenience.  Whilst  I
    accept that the FtT used somewhat loose terminology in referring to the
    standard as a "low one", it nevertheless qualified that as stated above
    in paragraph 4.  This makes it clear that the  FtT  was  assessing  the
    evidence by applying the balance of probabilities and  I  am  satisfied
    that the decision was properly made having regard to the evidence.  The
    FtT gave its reasons which were that it found that  there  were  enough
    answers given correctly and consistently for the FtT  to  be  satisfied
    that the couple were in a genuine relationship and that it  was  not  a
    marriage of convenience.

Decision

12.  The appeal is dismissed.  There is no material error of  law  disclosed
    in the decision which shall stand.
