|DETERMINATION AND REASONS                                                 |

Representation:

For  the  Appellant:      Mr.  A.  Slatter,  of   Counsel,   instructed   by
                          Hammersmith & Fulham Community Law Centre.
For the Respondent:          Ms. K. Evans,  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
                          Officer.

1.1   The Appellant is a national of Russia, born on  5th  April  1973.  She
     appeals, with leave, against the determination of J. Simpson  Esq.,  an
     Adjudicator, who (following a hearing on 11th  July  2003  at  Croydon)
     dismissed her appeal on asylum and human  rights  grounds  against  the
     Respondent's decision of 26th January 2001 to refuse to vary  leave  to
     remain in the United Kingdom and to refuse her asylum and human  rights
     claims. Her son, Master Feodor Khorochilov, claims as her dependant  in
     this appeal.

1.2   This decision is being reported because:

      (a)   We consider the relevance of an  application  for  consideration
           under the announcement in October 2003 of "an audit exercise  of
           all family applications for asylum  lodged  before  2nd  October
           2003" (hereafter referred to as the  October  Exercise)  to  the
           phrase "in accordance with the law" as that phrase  is  used  in
           Article 8(2).

            Our consideration of this argument  is  set  out  at  paragraphs
           14.1 to 14.13 below.

      (b)   We consider the relevance of a false asylum claim to  the  delay
           of the Secretary of State in reaching a decision on that  claim.
           We also consider the relevance of long residence in  the  United
           Kingdom in the case of an Article 8 claim to private and  family
           life, where the private and family life arrangements  have  been
           entered into whilst awaiting a decision from  the  Secretary  of
           State on the false asylum claim and whilst  pursuing  an  appeal
           against the refusal of the asylum claim.

                 Our consideration of this is set out at paragraph  15.14(a)
     below.

2.    The grounds of application challenge  the  Adjudicator's  decision  on
     two grounds:

      (a)   with regard to the Article 8 claim. This challenge  was  brought
           only   with   regard   to   the   Adjudicator's   decision    on
           proportionality.

      (b)   with regard to the Adjudicator's assessment of credibility.

      Permission to appeal was granted only with regard to Article 8  claim.



3.    However, at the hearing before us, Mr. Slatter  sought  to  widen  the
     ambit of the grant of permission,  contending  that  the  Secretary  of
     State's decision to remove the Appellant was "not  in  accordance  with
     the law", as is required under Article 8(2) of the ECHR. We  expand  on
     his argument below. Of course, the concept of proportionality  is  part
     of the requirement that any interference with the rights under  Article
     8(1) must be "necessary in a democratic society" and is  separate  from
     the requirement in Article 8(2)  that  any  interference  must  be  "in
     accordance with the law".

4.    The following summarises the immigration  history  of  the  Appellant,
     the date of her marriage and birth of her children:

      19th May 1996:   The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom. She  was
                       granted limited leave to remain for 3 months  subject
                       to certain restrictions.

            On an application  for  an  extension  of  her  leave,  she  was
                       granted further leave to remain, subject to the  same
                       restrictions until 19th November 1996.

      19th Nov 1996:   She applied for asylum.

      7th Jan 1997:    She submitted her completed  "Statement  of  Evidence
                       Form".

      3rd Oct  1997:     She  met  her  husband.  He  is  a  fellow  Russian
                       national. At this stage, her  husband  did  not  have
                       leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

      7th Sept 1999:   Their first child was born.  He  is  now  about  4  ï¿½
           years old.

      3rd  Feb  2000:     The  Appellant's  partner  was  granted  4  years'
                       exceptional leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

      19th Jun 2000:   The Appellant and her partner married.

      20th Sept 2000:  The Appellant applied for variation of her leave,  as
           a spouse.

      19th Oct 2000:   The Appellant was interviewed about  her  asylum  and
                       human rights claims.

      25th Jan 2001:   The Respondent refused her asylum  and  human  rights
           claims.

      Aug 2001:  The Appellant's and her husband's second  child  was  born.
                       He is now 2 years 7 or 8 months old.

5.1   The Adjudicator's Determination: The Adjudicator heard  oral  evidence
     from the Appellant, her husband and two other witnesses.

5.2   The Adjudicator did not find the Appellant  credible.  He  found  that
     she had fabricated her accounts of the basis of her  asylum  claim.  He
     found that he could not rely on anything she had told him.  This  means
     that the Appellant made a false asylum  claim.  This  is  an  important
     point, to which we will return later. The Adjudicator's  assessment  of
     credibility was not challenged. He considered that her most  surprising
     claim was that she had not discussed her immigration  status  with  her
     husband or discussed with him what might happen if  her  appeal  proved
     unsuccessful. She initially told the Adjudicator that her  husband  did
     not know about her immigration status even as at the hearing  date  but
     then changed her story, saying that they had discussed the  possibility
     of her returning to Russia and that he did know of her correct  status.
     The  Adjudicator  considered  that  the   Appellant's   oral   evidence
     conflicted with common sense as well as with the written  statement  of
     her husband in which he impliedly admits knowledge of  her  immigration
     status (paragraph 5(g) of the Determination).

5.3   In considering the Article 8 claim, the  Adjudicator  noted  that  the
     Appellant had undertaken study whilst in the  United  Kingdom  and  had
     gained a recent examination pass in English. She  had  an  offer  of  a
     university place. Her university studies were due to  commence  in  the
     autumn following the hearing before him. She is married  to  a  Russian
     national who was refused asylum but who has  leave  to  remain  in  the
     United Kingdom until the beginning of 2004. The Adjudicator noted  that
     they have two children, aged 4 and almost 2  years.  He  was  satisfied
     that the Appellant and her husband have always known of the Appellant's
     precarious immigration status and despite this had decided  to  produce
     two children. He  considered  that  there  is  no  certainty  that  the
     Appellant's husband will be permitted  to  remain  permanently  in  the
     United Kingdom and that, apart from his lack of desire, the Adjudicator
     could see no valid reason why he should not return to Russia  with  the
     Appellant if he wished to keep his family intact.  If  the  Appellant's
     husband  gains  permanent  residency  in  the   United   Kingdom,   the
     Adjudicator could see no valid  reason  why  the  Appellant  could  not
     return to Russia and make either a student  or  spouse  application  to
     return  to  the  United  Kingdom.  Although  this  would  involve  some
     disruption  to  her  family  life,  this  must  have  been   a   factor
     contemplated by her when embarking  on  her  family  arrangements.  The
     Adjudicator could see no reason why  she  should  receive  preferential
     treatment over those who follow  the  rules.  He  considered  that  the
     children are very young and will be quite capable of  adjusting  easily
     to life in Russia on either a permanent or temporary basis if  they  go
     with the Appellant. The Adjudicator therefore decided that removal  was
     proportionate to the Appellant's right to her family  life  or  private
     life.

6.    Grounds of application:  The  grounds  of  application  challenge  the
     Adjudicator's decision on proportionality, on the following grounds:

      (a)   That the Adjudicator had failed to take into account  the  delay
           on the part of the  Respondent  in  making  a  decision  on  the
           Appellant's application for asylum.  Reliance is placed on Arben
           Shala v. SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 233.

       (b)    That  the  Adjudicator  had  attached  undue  weight  to   the
           Appellant's precarious immigration history pending resolution of
           her asylum claim. In Mahmood v. The Secretary of State  for  the
           Home Department [2001] INLR 1, [2001]  IAR  229,  the  Court  of
           Appeal enunciated the principle that knowledge of the precarious
           immigration status on  the  part  of  the  other  party  to  the
           marriage at the time of the marriage militates against a finding
           that removal violates Article  8.  The  grounds  of  application
           contend that the instant appeal is distinguishable in  that  the
           Appellant had not been refused leave to enter or remain  at  the
           time of her marriage. Further, or  in  the  alternative,  it  is
           asserted that, before the decision was made in  this  case,  the
           Appellant had met her husband, had a child and been married.

      (c)   In stating that he could see no valid reason why  the  Appellant
           could not return to Russia and make an entry clearance either as
           a student or a  spouse,  the  Adjudicator  had  not  taken  into
           account the difficulties which she would face in Russia  or  the
           uncertainty over the length of separation between the  Appellant
           and her family members. Women  in  Russia  face  discrimination.
           There is bribery  and  corruption  in  the  propiska  regulation
           system which is required for access to the  most  civil,  social
           and economic rights.

7.1   At the commencement of the hearing before us, Mr.  Slatter  sought  an
     adjournment of the hearing. On  11th  December  2003,  the  Appellant's
     husband applied for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  (page  140  of  the
     Appellant's bundle). This application is outstanding the  Secretary  of
     State.  On 16th  February  2004,  the  Appellant  was  invited  by  the
     Secretary of State to make an application for consideration  under  the
     October Exercise.  The Appellant's application has been lodged. In  Mr.
     Slatter's submission, prima  facie,  the  Appellant  has  a  legitimate
     expectation that she  might  fall  within  the  terms  of  the  October
     Exercise.  Mr.  Slatter  informed  us  that  he  understood  that   the
     Appellant's application would be decided the following week,  to  which
     Ms. Evans responded that that could not be correct, as she had the file
     with her in the hearing room. If we were to proceed with  the  hearing,
     Mr. Slatter submitted that this would prejudice the Appellant. This  is
     because, following a refusal, there would be further Article  8  issues
     which would need to be determined. When we asked Mr. Slatter to explain
     what other Article 8 issues would need to be determined, he  said  that
     the issue of proportionality would need to be determined.

7.2   We refused to adjourn the hearing. Mr. Slatter could not explain  what
     further issues would arise if the  Appellant's  application  under  the
     October Exercise is refused, save  only  to  say  that  proportionality
     would arise. However, the issue of proportionality was  before  us  for
     determination. We could see no valid reason for  not  determining  that
     issue. The Appellant is  only  eligible  for  consideration  under  the
     October Exercise. It is for the Secretary of State to decide whether he
     was prepared  to  exercise  his  discretion  and  grant  the  Appellant
     indefinite leave to remain under the terms of the October Exercise.

8.1   Mr. Slatter then commenced his substantive submissions.  In  addition,
     to elaborating on the grounds of application, he raised the  additional
     point we have already referred to  -  namely,  that  the  Secretary  of
     State's decision is "not in accordance  with  the  law"  under  Article
     8(2), applying the Court of Appeal's judgement in Abdi  by  analogy  to
     the same  phrase  in  Article  8(2).  The  decision  would  not  be  in
     accordance  with  the  law  because  the  Appellant  has  a  legitimate
     expectation that she would be granted indefinite leave to remain  under
     the terms of the October Exercise.

8.2   We informed Mr. Slatter that there was no mention in  the  grounds  of
     application of this  point. In response, Mr. Slatter informed that this
     could not have been raised in the grounds of application,  because  the
     October Exercise was  only  announced  in  October  2003,  whereas  the
     grounds were  lodged  on  7th  August  2003.  We  agreed  to  hear  his
     submissions on the "in accordance with the law" point, so that we could
     consider the relevance (if any) of the submissions he wished to make to
     the substantive appeal  before  us.  Mr.  Slatter  contended  that  the
     Appellant "will" qualify under the October Exercise, although  he  then
     retracted from this  assertion,  by  saying  that  "we  are  not  sure"
     (meaning, presumably, himself and his instructing solicitors) that  the
     Appellant would qualify but that there are clear dangers in  prejudging
     that issue by proceeding with the  hearing.  However,  we  had  already
     decided to refuse  the  adjournment  request.  Mr.  Slatter  relied  on
     paragraph  14  of  the  Tribunal's  Determination  in  Entry  Clearance
     Officer, Tehran v. Arezi [2002] UKIAT 07694.  The  Tribunal  stated  in
     that case that the legitimate expectation of the applicant in that case
     that he would be granted  entry  clearance  under  the  family  reunion
     policy was a substantive and not a procedural benefit.

8.3   In  Mahmood,  the  Court  of  Appeal  enunciated  the  principle  that
     knowledge of the precarious immigration status on the part of the other
     party to the marriage at the time of the marriage militates  against  a
     finding that removal violates Article 8. Paragraphs 23 and  26  of  the
     judgement of the Court of Appeal in Mahmood explains the mischief which
     this principle addresses. In the  instant  appeal,  the  Appellant  had
     arrived in the United Kingdom with entry clearance as  a  visitor.  The
     appeal in this case is one against a refusal to vary leave. Mr. Slatter
     did not seek to suggest that anyone who arrives in the  United  Kingdom
     as a visitor and who then enters into a marriage in the United  Kingdom
     is entitled to succeed under Article 8.  However, she is  in  a  better
     position than someone who arrives in the United Kingdom  without  leave
     and who jumps the queue.

8.4   In Mr. Slatter's submission, the Adjudicator attached undue weight  to
     the  knowledge  of  the  parties  as  to  the  Appellant's   precarious
     immigration status. At the time the Appellant's relationship  with  her
     husband began, the date of her marriage and  the  birth  of  her  first
     child, the Appellant's husband could not have known that the  Appellant
     was unlikely to be granted leave because her application for asylum had
     not  been  refused.  This  case  was  therefore  distinguishable   from
     Abdulaziz  and  Poku.  The  Appellant's  husband   had   a   legitimate
     expectation that the Appellant would be granted variation of leave as a
     spouse. She would have been able to make such an  application  when  he
     was granted indefinite leave to remain. He had a legitimate expectation
     that he would be granted indefinite leave to remain at the end  of  his
     period of exceptional leave. Indefinite leave  to  remain  is  normally
     granted at the end of a period of 4 years' exceptional leave to  remain
     unless the continued presence of an individual is not conducive to  the
     public good. In Mr. Slatter's submission, no such factors exist in this
     case. This is distinguishable from Poku and Abdulaziz, because in those
     cases the spouses knew that their partners would not   be  granted  any
     form of leave.

8.5   In deciding  proportionality,  Mr.  Slatter  asked  us  to  take  into
     account the length of the Appellant's residence in the  United  Kingdom
     and her conduct, by which he meant that she had no criminal convictions
     and was not receiving any financial support from  the  state.  He  also
     relied on the factors listed at paragraph 15 of the  Skeleton  Argument
     on page 120 of the Appellant's bundle. The situation in Russia is  also
     relevant. He relied on paragraphs 6.30 to 6.31 of the CIPU report dated
     April 2003, which show the difficulties in moving and living in another
     part of Russia. We asked Mr. Slatter to explain why the Appellant would
     have to move elsewhere, given that the Adjudicator had found  that  she
     had fabricated her asylum claim. Mr. Slatter submitted  that  there  is
     bribery and corruption. Women are discriminated against,  according  to
     paragraph 6.39 of the same report.

8.6   Mr. Slatter submitted that  the  Respondent  had  not  discharged  the
     burden to show that the interference with the Appellant's right to  her
     family life is "in accordance with the law" and would be proportionate.
     The Appellant would have to return to Russia on  her  own  without  her
     children, not knowing how long an  entry  clearance  application  would
     take.

9.1   In relation to Mr.  Slatter's  contention  that  the  Appellant  "will
     qualify" under the October Exercise, Ms. Evans asked us  to  note  that
     the October Exercise only applies to families who do not have any  form
     of leave. In this case, the Appellant's husband has  exceptional  leave
     to remain. Furthermore, it cannot be said  that  the  Appellant  "will"
     qualify because the decision is one for the Secretary of State to make,
     after  considering  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.   In  the
     judgement in Abdi, the Court of Appeal stated  that  the  Secretary  of
     State should have regard to his polices.  The  Secretary  of  State  is
     having regard to the relevant policy in this case. The announcement  by
     the Minister in relation to the October  Exercise  sets  out  inclusion
     criteria, exclusion criteria and then a paragraph by which it is  clear
     that the most which can be said is that an individual is "eligible" for
     consideration.  When  the   Appellant's   representatives   lodged   an
     application for variation of  her leave as spouse, they must have known
     that the application could not succeed because  her  husband  only  had
     exceptional leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  at  that  time.
     Nevertheless, they still lodged an application.

9.2   No reasons  have  been  forwarded  which  show  that  the  Appellant's
     husband cannot reasonably be expected to  return  to  Russia  with  the
     Appellant to live. He is not a  refugee.   If  the  Appellant  were  to
     return to Russia to make  an  application  for  entry  clearance,   the
     success or otherwise of such an application cannot be considered. There
     are 3 entry clearance posts in Russia - one in St. Petersburg,  one  in
     Moscow and one in Ekatrinberg. The Appellant's husband comes  from  St.
     Petersburg. The section  in  the  CIPU  report  entitled:  "Freedom  of
     Movement" relates to individuals who have difficulties with the Russian
     authorities. This Appellant has a  passport,  although  this  may  have
     expired. There is no reason why she would not be able  to  obtain  such
     facilities again.

10.   In response, Mr. Slatter submitted that the  Secretary  of  State  was
     taking a contradictory stance in relation to the Appellant. On the  one
     hand, he has invited her to lodge  an  application  under  the  October
     Exercise and, on the other hand, he is seeking to  remove  her.  It  is
     unreasonable to expect her to return to Russia to make  an  application
     for entry clearance when she has two outstanding  applications  in  the
     United Kingdom. She has a legitimate  expectation  that  she  would  be
     granted  leave  to  remain.  Mr.  Slatter  did  not  know  whether  the
     Appellant's husband had lodged an appeal against the refusal  to  grant
     him asylum. He did not know whether the husband still maintains that he
     has a well-founded fear of persecution. Mr. Slatter submitted  that  it
     would be unreasonable to expect  him  to  return  to  Russia  with  the
     Appellant. Mr. Slatter did not know  whether  the  Appellant's  husband
     would or would not be willing to return to Russia.

11.   We reserved our determination.

12.   We have decided to dismiss the appeal, for reasons which we now give.

      DETERMINATION AND REASONS

13.   Before giving our reasons, it is appropriate for  us  to  address  one
     matter. During his submissions, Mr. Slatter contended that we  appeared
     to have made up our minds about the appeal, to which we responded  that
     we  were  merely  pointing  out  to  him  the  difficulties  with   his
     submissions, so that he would be able to address them. We  would  state
     that  we  consider  ourselves  entitled  to  raise  difficulties   with
     representatives. On many occasions, representatives have been  able  to
     adequately address the difficulties; on many other occasions, they have
     not. Mr. Slatter was not able to, save that he was able to explain  why
     there was no  mention   in  the  grounds  of  application  of  his  "in
     accordance with the law" argument. Given his explanation, we agreed  to
     hear his submissions on this  argument.  We  now  turn  to  giving  our
     reasons for dismissing this appeal.

14.1  It is not disputed that the Appellant and her family unit have  formed
     private and family life in the United Kingdom. It is not disputed  that
     the reasons for the interference comes within one of  the  (exhaustive)
     list of reasons in Article 8(2).

14.2  For the reasons we have already given (see paragraph  8.2  above),  we
     agreed to hear Mr. Slatter's submissions as to  why  the  Secretary  of
     State's decision is "not in accordance with the law". This was in order
     to enable us to decide whether  the  points  he  wished  to  make  were
     relevant to the substantive issues before us.

14.3  Mr. Slatter argues that the reasoning of the Court of Appeal  in  Abdi
     (Dajui Saleban) v. The Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
     [1996] Imm AR 148  with  regard  to  the  meaning  of  the  phrase  "in
     accordance with the law" in what is now paragraph 21(1) of  Schedule  4
     of the 1999 Act can be applied by analogy to the same phrase as used in
     Article 8(2). We do not agree. We drew Mr. Slatter's attention  to  the
     fact that it is clear from Strasbourg jurisprudence that the phrase "in
     accordance with the law" in Article 8(2)  means  whether  there  is  in
     place a legislative framework for the decision which gives rise to  the
     interference with the rights protected under Article 8(1) and that this
     is published in a form which  is  accessible  to  those  likely  to  be
     affected.  We see no justification for extending  the  meaning  of  the
     phrase in Article 8(2) in the way Mr. Slatter seeks to do. In  essence,
     he seeks to persuade us to allow the Appellant's appeal outright simply
     because the Secretary of State has not yet reached a  decision  on  her
     application for leave to remain under the October Exercise.  There  are
     two problems with this:

      (i)   firstly, the jurisdiction of an Adjudicator (and  the  Tribunal)
           in a Section 65 appeal is limited  to  considering  whether  the
           decision is contrary to the ECHR. There is simply no  scope  for
           the Tribunal to allow the Appellant's appeal simply because  the
           Secretary of State has not reached a decision on her application
           for  consideration  for  leave  to  remain  under  the   October
           Exercise;

      (ii)  to allow  the  Appellant's  appeal  outright  would  effectively
           confer on her a benefit  which  she  does  not  have  under  the
           October Exercise (for the reasons we give in paragraphs 14.9  to
           14.12 below).

14.4  The  other  alternative  would  be  for  the  Tribunal  to  allow  the
     Appellant's appeal to the limited extent that we direct  the  Secretary
     of State to consider his policy as set out in the October Exercise. But
     that is something which the Secretary of State is already doing in this
     case. He has invited the Appellant to make  an  application  under  the
     October Exercise and is considering her application.

14.5  Even if  the  legislative  framework  under  which  the  Secretary  of
     State's decision has been made includes the  October  Exercise,  it  is
     only necessary for us to be satisfied that the Secretary  of  State  is
     aware of his policy and is addressing his mind to it in the Appellant's
     case. That is all which is  necessary  in  order  to  satisfy  the  "in
     accordance with the law" issue in Article 8(2).

14.6  In this particular case,  the  Secretary  of  State  has  invited  the
     Appellant to make an application under the October Exercise. If in  any
     particular appeal being dealt with by an Adjudicator, the Secretary  of
     State has not yet extended an invitation  to  the  claimant  who  might
     potentially be eligible, the fact  that  an  invitation  has  not  been
     extended does not render the decision not "in accordance with the  law"
     for the purposes of Article 8(2). This is because it is clear from  the
     then-Minister's announcement that the Secretary of State will write  to
     those who appear to qualify. That undertaking  is  sufficient  to  show
     that the Secretary of State is aware of his policy  and  is  addressing
     his mind to whether an individual may or may not qualify.

14.7  It is clear that the Secretary of State's decision to refuse  to  vary
     leave has been made under a legislative framework (which phrase  covers
     primary as well as subordinate legislation). Mr. Slatter did  not  seek
     to argue otherwise. It is clear that the relevant law under  which  the
     Secretary of State's decision has been taken was  "accessible"  to  the
     Appellant. Mr. Slatter did not seek to argue otherwise.

14.8  What we have said above concerns whether a decision to remove (or,  in
     this case, to refuse to vary leave) is "in accordance with the law" for
     the purposes of Article 8(2).  This is not  to  say  that  Home  Office
     polices are always wholly irrelevant to an Article 8  claim.  A  policy
     may be relevant when one comes to consider the State's interest in  the
     aim of immigration  control  -  i.e.  in  considering  proportionality.
     Whether it is relevant or not will depend on whether it  can  be  shown
     that the claimant  is  entitled  (as  opposed  to  being  eligible  for
     consideration) under a particular policy.  If  a  claimant  is  clearly
     entitled to be granted leave to remain under a policy, then this  could
     render the Secretary of State's decision unlawful or, put another  way,
     his decision to remove the Appellant (or, in this case,  to  refuse  to
     vary leave)  may  well  be  one  which  is  not  within  the  range  of
     permissible responses or one which no  reasonable  Secretary  of  State
     (operating such a  policy) could reach. However, it must be clear  that
     the person is entitled  to  leave  under  the  policy.  In  many  cases
     (including the present one), it will not be possible for an Adjudicator
     or the Tribunal to conclude that a person  will  be  bound  to  succeed
     under a policy; hence the reason why in  Abdi  the  claimant  succeeded
     only to the extent of having his claim considered by the  Secretary  of
     State in accordance with the  relevant  policy.  Adjudicators  and  the
     Tribunal are often asked to place less weight on the  state's  interest
     in immigration control simply because the claimant in  question  nearly
     qualifies, albeit that they do not actually qualify, under a particular
     policy. The fact that a person nearly qualifies does not  detract  from
     the state's interest in immigration control. The Secretary of State has
     a discretion to operate polices outside the Immigration Rules  for  any
     persons or categories of persons, in his  absolute  discretion.  If  we
     were to decide that we are  entitled  to  pay  less  deference  to  the
     state's legitimate interest in the aim of immigration  control  because
     an individual "nearly" qualifies under a  policy,  this  would  make  a
     completely unwarranted inroad into the  executive's  right  to  control
     immigration and formulate policies. It is not for the Adjudicators  and
     the Tribunal to effectively extend  the  application  of  an  announced
     policy to persons who do not qualify by paying less  deference  to  the
     state's right  to  control  immigration  simply  because  they  "nearly
     qualify".

14.9  In the instant appeal, the Appellant is not entitled  to  a  grant  of
     leave under the October Exercise. Mr.  Slatter's  contention  that  the
     interference with the Appellant's right to her family life is  not  "in
     accordance with the law" is based on the assertion that  the  Appellant
     has a legitimate expectation that she would be granted leave under  the
     October Exercise. We have already rejected his attempt  to  expand  the
     Abdi principle to the phrase "in accordance with the  law"  in  Article
     8(2). That  leaves  his  second  point  -  that  the  Appellant  has  a
     legitimate expectation that she would be granted leave to  enter  under
     the October Exercise. We reject the  assertion  that  she  has  such  a
     legitimate expectation. It is clear, from the terms of the letter dated
     29th October 2003 from the then-Minister  of  State  that  persons  who
     satisfy the  inclusion  criteria  and  are  not  within  the  exclusion
     criteria:

                 "will be eligible for the concession".

14.10 The phrase "will be eligible for the concession" does  not  mean  that
     the grant of leave will follow. Furthermore, the final sentence of  the
     penultimate paragraph of that letter states that  the  concession  does
     not cover families who  have  been  granted  any  form  of  leave.  The
     Appellant's husband had exceptional  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
     Kingdom at the date of the announcement of the October  Exercise.  This
     may or may not disqualify her from succeeding in her application  under
     the October Exercise. This would depend on the  meaning  given  to  the
     last sentence of the penultimate paragraph (of  the  letter  announcing
     the October Exercise) by the Secretary of State.

14.11 For these reasons, the assertion that the Appellant has  a  legitimate
     expectation that she would be granted leave under the October  Exercise
     is unarguable.

14.12 Mr. Slatter also  asserts  that  the  legitimate  expectation  of  the
     Appellant that she would be granted leave under the October Exercise is
     a substantive benefit,  and  not  merely  a  procedural  one.  In  this
     respect, he relied on paragraph 14 of the Tribunal's  Determination  in
     Azeri. There are two difficulties with  this  contention.  Firstly,  we
     have already given our reasons for concluding that the  Appellant  does
     not have a legitimate expectation that she would be granted leave under
     the October Exercise. Secondly, we noted paragraphs 2  and  11  of  the
     Tribunal's Determination in the Azeri case.  It is clear in  that  case
     that the  applicant  had  been  sent  a  letter  by  the  British  High
     Commission  stating  that  there  was  no  problem  in  processing  his
     application for family reunion. The letter suggested that the applicant
     would be granted entry clearance under the family  reunion  policy.  It
     was principally for this reason that the Tribunal was  satisfied  that,
     "on the facts of [that] appeal", a legitimate  expectation  arose  that
     the Appellant would be granted  entry  clearance  and  that  that  [the
     legitimate expectation] was a substantive benefit and not a  procedural
     benefit. The Tribunal did not say that in all cases where an  applicant
     is being considered under a policy, the benefit is  a  substantive  one
     and not a procedural one. The Appellant in this case is  only  entitled
     to be considered under the October Exercise. She is being considered.

14.13 For all of the  above  reasons,  we  reject  the  assertion  that  the
     decision to remove is not "in accordance with the law" as  that  phrase
     is used in  Article  8(2).  We  also  reject  the  assertion  that  the
     determination of this appeal prejudges the Appellant's application  for
     considering under the October  Exercise.  We  are  not  prejudging  her
     application at all. We are determining her Article 8 claim. The two are
     entirely separate. The October Exercise, unlike for example the  7-year
     child policy or the long residence policy, is  not  a  policy  that  is
     intended to guide  Home  Office  decision-makers  on  how  to  approach
     proportionality issues under Article 8(2), but is  merely  a  pragmatic
     exercise to  deal  with  a  particular  category  of  persons  who  the
     Secretary of State considers are difficult to remove.

15.1  We now turn to consider the  proportionality  issues  which  arise  in
     this particular case.

15.2  The first point we should note is the fact that,  in  this  case,  the
     Secretary of State had considered the Appellant's Article 8 claim.  The
     essential facts are not in dispute. We  must  decide  whether,  on  the
     facts as a whole, the decision to remove is a lawful one. In accordance
     with the guidance of the Tribunal in [2004]  UKIAT  00024  M  (presided
     over by the  President),  our  approach  is  to  consider  whether  the
     Respondent's decision to remove the Appellant is within  the  range  of
     permissible responses as to whether removal would be  proportionate  to
     the interference with private and family life.

15.3  The Appellant has now lived in the United Kingdom for nearly 8  years.
     This is a long period. Her husband arrived in 1995 (paragraph 15.11  of
     the Skeleton Argument, on page 121 of the Appellant's bundle).  He  has
     lived in the United Kingdom for even longer.  Set  against  their  long
     residence is the  fact that both of them  spent  the  larger  parts  of
     their lives in Russia. There is another factor  which  has  to  be  set
     against the Appellant's long residence. We refer to this,  and  explain
     our reasoning, in paragraph  15.14(a)  below.  The  Appellant  and  her
     husband are both Russian nationals. They have been living  together  as
     husband and wife in the United Kingdom for 4 ï¿½ years.  Their  children,
     who were born in the United Kingdom, have never lived  in  Russia.  Set
     against this is the fact that both of the children are young enough  to
     adapt to life in Russia; the older child is about 4 ï¿½ years old and the
     younger about 2 years 8  months  old.   The  Appellant  has  gained  an
     examination  pass  in  the  English  language  (paragraph  20  of   the
     Adjudicator's Determination) and she has an offer of  a  place  at  the
     University of Westminster which was due to commence in  September  2003
     (paragraph 15.10 of the Skeleton Argument).  Mr.  Slatter  informed  us
     that the Appellant is not receiving  any  financial  support  from  the
     state. Whilst it may be that she is not receiving any direct  financial
     assistance, we note that page 99 of the Appellant's bundle refers to an
     application for re-housing in June 2003 and page 101 of the same bundle
     refers to an application for nursery funding. However, we are  prepared
     to proceed on the assumption that any indirect financial assistance  is
     a neutral factor in this particular case.

15.4  Paragraphs 15.8 and  15.9  of  the  Skeleton  Argument  refer  to  the
     Appellant's health and that of her younger son. According to  pages  98
     to 102 of the Appellant bundle, their health problems are as follows:

      (a)   the Appellant suffers from eczema and asthma  (page  98  of  the
           Appellant's bundle). In 1997, she was diagnosed with an  ovarian
           cyst (page 102 of the  Appellant's  bundle).  According  to  the
           letter dated 16th October 2001 on page 101, she had  a  previous
           history of post-natal depression.  The letter  dated  18th  June
           2003 states that she suffered an episode of depression following
           the loss of her job in 1998 and a 6-month episode of  post-natal
           depression following the birth of her  first  son  in  1998  (we
           assume that this is a mistake and that the year of the birth  of
           the first son was in fact 1999).

            We note that there is nothing in these letters  which  indicates
           that the Appellant is now suffering from any depression, nor  is
           there any indication that she is  receiving  any  treatment  for
           depression.  Accordingly,  it  appears  that,  at  present,  she
           suffers from eczema and asthma. There is no indication in  these
           documents of the severity of either condition.

       (b)    The  Appellant's  second  son  (Master  Anton  Sukonkin)   has
           suspected atopic eczema. This is a skin condition which is often
           linked to allergies. According to  the  letter  dated  2nd  June
           2003, he has been referred for allergy skin patch  testing.  Dr.
           T.  Strommer  of  the  Staunton  Group  Practice  has  a  strong
           suspicion that the child may be allergic  to  house  dust  mites
           living in carpets.  Our attention was not drawn to  the  results
           of any such skin patch testing. There is a strong family history
           of atopy and asthma. The Appellant is worried that her  son  may
           develop asthma in the near future.

            There is nothing to suggest that the Appellant's second  son  is
           actually suffering from asthma. He suffers from  atopic  eczema.
           In May 2003, he was suffering from severely infected eczema.  We
           have not been told what his condition is  now  and  whether  the
           eczema is under control.

15.5  Mr. Slatter relied on paragraphs 6.30 and 6.31  of  the  CIPU  report.
     His argument  was  that  this  shows  that  the  Appellant  would  have
     difficulties in registering herself if she were to  move  somewhere  to
     live. The difficulties in registering would  mean  that  she  would  be
     deprived of most civil, social and economic  rights.  She  may  not  be
     admitted to public services such as free medical  services.  There  are
     some problems with Mr. Slatter's contentions in this respect.  Firstly,
     the Appellant would only experience difficulties in registering herself
     elsewhere if she moves elsewhere. Paragraph 6.30 states:

            People who have a well-founded  fear  of  persecution  from  the
           local  authorities  in  one  of  the  regions  of  the   Russian
           Federation, without the involvement of or the complicity of  the
           federal  authorities,  may,   in   principle,   find   effective
           protection elsewhere in Russia.

      The CIPU report then goes on to mention the difficulties  in  settling
     elsewhere, including the difficulties in registering oneself elsewhere.



15.6  The Appellant was found to have fabricated the  basis  of  her  asylum
     claim. Accordingly, she does not need  to  relocate.  Accordingly,  the
     general difficulties in registering  elsewhere  are  academic  in  this
     case. Secondly, she has a passport, although it has expired.  There  is
     no reason to suppose that she would not be able to obtain  an  internal
     passport again. Thirdly, the medical evidence before us falls far short
     of showing that the Appellant and her son are receiving  any  treatment
     at the present time which  would  not  be  available  to  them  in  the
     Appellant's home area in Russia. In reaching this conclusion,  we  have
     taken into account paragraph 5.30 of the CIPU report dated  April  2003
     which refers to difficulties  with  medical  services  in  Russia.  For
     example, there is a shortage of vitamins and medicines and insufficient
     inoculations.

15.7  Whilst there is discrimination against women, bribery  and  corruption
     in Russia, we do not see that this  renders  it  unreasonable  for  the
     Appellant to return to Russia either permanently or temporarily to make
     an entry clearance, with or without  her  family.  If  she  returns  to
     Russia on her own to make an entry clearance application,  we  have  no
     reason to suppose that any  separation  from  her  family  would  be  a
     protracted one or such which  renders  removal  unlawful.  Whether  the
     application would ultimately be successful or not is irrelevant to  the
     consideration of the Article 8 claim now.  To  decide  otherwise  would
     effectively place the Appellant in a  better position than those  whose
     spouses have settled status in the United Kingdom.

15.8  In  Mahmood,  the  Court  of  Appeal  enunciated  the  principle  that
     knowledge of the precarious immigration status on the part of the other
     party to the marriage at the time of the marriage militates  against  a
     finding that removal violates Article 8. Mr.  Slatter  referred  us  to
     paragraphs 23 and 26 of the judgement in that case which  explains  the
     mischief which this principle is intended to address. We quote from the
     relevant part of paragraph 23 of the judgement of Laws LJ:

      23.   This reasoning ................ within it there is  in  my  view
           to be found an important truth which bears  generally  on  cases
           such as this. Firm immigration control requires  consistency  of
           treatment between one aspiring immigrant  and  another.  If  the
           established rule is to the effect - as it is -  that   a  person
           seeking rights of residence here on  grounds  of  marriage  (not
           being someone who already enjoys a  leave,  albeit  limited,  to
           remain in the UK) must obtain an entry clearance in his  country
           of origin, then a waiver of that  requirement  in  the  case  of
           someone who has found his way here without  an  entry  clearance
           and then seeks to remain on marriage grounds,  having  no  other
           legitimate claim to enter, would in the absence  of  exceptional
           circumstances to justify the waiver, disrupt and undermine  firm
           immigration control because it would  be  manifestly  unfair  to
           other would-be entrants who are content to take their  place  in
           the entry clearance queue in their country of origin.

      (our emphasis)

15.9  Mr. Slatter relied on the  words  in  bold.  In  his  submission,  the
     Appellant in the instant appeal had arrived in the United Kingdom  with
     entry clearance as a visitor. The appeal in this case is one against  a
     refusal to vary leave. In his submission, she is in a  better  position
     than someone who arrives in the United Kingdom without  leave  and  who
     jumps the queue.

15.10 At first sight, it appears that the Appellant is in a better  position
     than someone who enters  the  United  Kingdom  illegally.  However,  on
     closer examination, we concluded that there is little substance in  Mr.
     Slatter's submissions in this regard. The Appellant's position is to be
     distinguished from a person who enjoys limited  leave  and  who  enters
     into a marriage during the currency of that leave. At no material  time
     did the Appellant have any leave. By "material time", we refer  to  the
     commencement of her relationship with her husband, the dates  of  birth
     of her first child and the date of her marriage. She had an application
     to vary her leave on asylum grounds. We emphasise the fact that she did
     not have any leave at any material time. Accordingly,  we  are  of  the
     view that the mischief which  the  principle  to  which  we  have  been
     referred is intended to address is also a factor in this case.

15.11 For the reasons we have given above, we are satisfied that  there  are
     no exceptional factors in this case which  excuse  the  Appellant  from
     having to return to Russia to make an entry clearance.

15.12 In any event, Mr. Slatter was not able to tell us why the  Appellant's
     husband could not reasonably be expected to return to Russia  with  the
     Appellant and his children, except only to say that her  husband  might
     maintain that he has a well-founded fear of  persecution.  Even  if  he
     does maintain that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Russia,
     it does not follow that he has. Whilst we can appreciate that he  might
     not wish to give up his chance of being  granted  indefinite  leave  to
     remain in the United Kingdom, he is free to choose  whether  to  remain
     here or keep  his  family  intact  by  returning  to  Russia  with  the
     Appellant and his two children.

15.13 It cannot be said (as contended by Mr. Slatter) that  the  Appellant's
     husband had a legitimate expectation that the  Appellant's  application
     for variation of her leave as a spouse would  be  granted,  since  that
     application was lodged by her  representatives  (Hammersmith  &  Fulham
     Community Law Centre) in September 2000,  when  her  husband  only  had
     exceptional leave to remain in the United Kingdom. That application was
     bound to fail, as the Appellant's  representatives  can  reasonably  be
     expected to have known.

15.14 The Tribunal has stated on several occasions  in  the  past  that  the
     interests of the state in the legitimate aim of immigration control  is
     a very weighty consideration indeed. In this case,  there  has  been  a
     long delay (4 ï¿½ years) on  the  part  of  the  Secretary  of  State  in
     reaching a decision on the Appellant's asylum claim. This is a relevant
     factor. It is not so much a factor in the  Appellant's  favour  as  one
     which relates to the other side of the scales - namely, the  weight  to
     be given to the legitimate aim of immigration control.  However,  there
     are two important points we make concerning this delay:

      (a)   The Appellant was only granted  two  short  periods  of  limited
           leave. On the last day of her lawful leave,  she  made  a  false
           asylum claim. During the period of the delay of  4ï¿½  years  when
           her false asylum claim was being considered by the Secretary  of
           State, she knew she had  made a false asylum claim and  yet  she
           entered into her private life and family life arrangements.  The
           state's interest in legitimate aim of immigration control is not
           merely a reference to  the  fact  that  claimants  are  normally
           expected to be return to their  own  countries  and  make  entry
           clearance applications and that exceptional factors have  to  be
           shown to excuse them from having to do so. Where  an  Article  8
           claim is based on  arrangements  entered  into  whilst  a  false
           asylum claim is being  considered  by  the  Secretary  of  State
           and/or an appeal against that the refusal of that  false  asylum
           claim is being pursued, Adjudicators must give deference to  the
           state's interest in deterring false asylum claims. The abuse  of
           the system by persons who make false asylum claims clog  up  the
           system and reduce the state's effectiveness in dealing  promptly
           with genuine claims. Whilst it may be asserted that the  pursuit
           of an appeal on Article 8 grounds is separate from  the  pursuit
           of the appeal on asylum grounds, the inescapable fact  is  that,
           if that individual had never made the false asylum claim in  the
           first place, it is highly unlikely that  they  would  have  been
           able to "clock up" their residence in the United Kingdom  and/or
           establish their private and family life - in other  words,  they
           would not have had an Article 8 claim at all, if  they  had  not
           made a false asylum claim.  In cases where a false asylum  claim
           has been made, Adjudicators should therefore consider  not  only
           the state's interest in preventing queue jumping  but  also  the
           state's interest in deterring the abuse of  the  asylum  system.
           For these reasons, we concluded that, whilst the  delay  of  the
           Secretary of State in reaching a  decision  on  the  Appellant's
           asylum claim and the long residence  of  the  Appellant  in  the
           United Kingdom (nearly 8 years) are relevant  factors,  they  do
           not detract to any significant extent from the weight  which  is
           normally given to the state's interest in immigration control.

      (b)   The facts of this case are distinguishable from  Shala.  In  the
           Shala case, the claimant was married to  someone  who  had  been
           granted indefinite leave to remain as a refugee.  The  applicant
           in that case would not have fallen into the category of  persons
           who are required to apply for entry clearance  from  abroad  but
           for the delay in reaching a decision in his case. In the instant
           appeal, the Appellant has no other basis for  remaining  in  the
           United Kingdom. She has a chance (that is the most we  can  say)
           that she might  be granted indefinite leave to remain under  the
           October Exercise. When she met her husband in October  1997  and
           when her first child was born, neither she or  her  husband  had
           leave to remain in the United Kingdom. Her husband  was  granted
           exceptional leave to remain only in February 2000. He  has  made
           an application for indefinite leave to remain but the  grant  of
           indefinite leave to remain is by no means a forgone  conclusion.
           He has only recently become eligible for consideration  for  the
           grant of indefinite leave to remain.

15.15 We do not see any merit in the assertion that the Secretary  of  State
     is taking a contradictory stance in this case. The Appellant has lodged
     an appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse her human
     rights claim. Her Article 8  claim  is  being  determined  by  us.  The
     October Exercise is an  entirely  separate  matter.  If  the  Appellant
     succeeds in  her  appeal,  there  will  be  no  need  to  progress  her
     application under the October Exercise. If she fails  in  this  appeal,
     the Secretary of State would still consider her application  under  the
     October Exercise. He may decide  to  exercise  his  discretion  in  her
     favour and grant her leave. He may not. If he does, he would  not  seek
     to remove her. If he does not, then he will.

15.16 Considering all of the circumstances as  a  whole,  we  are  satisfied
     that the Respondent's decision to remove the Appellant is lawful as  it
     is within the range of permissible  responses  as  to  whether  removal
     would be proportionate to the  interference  with  private  and  family
     life. We agree  with  the  Adjudicator's  conclusion  that  removal  is
     proportionate to her rights to her private life  and  her  family  life
     under Article 8 claim.

16.   Accordingly, the Article 8 claim fails.

17.   It follow that we must dismiss this appeal.

      Decision

      The appeal is DISMISSED.
