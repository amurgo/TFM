For the Appellant:     No appearance or representation
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal of  the  present  respondent
    (who I will call the claimant) against  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision to refuse her entry clearance as a visitor.

 2. The claimant did not appear before me and was  not  represented.  Proper
    notice of hearing was sent to the claimant on 30  January  2014  by  air
    mail and by ordinary post to the solicitors in the  United  Kingdom  who
    were said to represent her. Clearly this is good service under the rules
    and, in any event, I am confident that  there  was  sufficient  time  to
    respond if that is what the claimant wished. This is  not  the  sort  of
    case where any  kind  of  response  is  to  be  expected.   I  therefore
    continued with the hearing in the claimant's absence.

 3. As is explained clearly in the Entry Clearance Officer's grounds  before
    me, the First-tier Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain  an  appeal
    from this claimant because she is not related to the person she intended
    to visit in a way they qualified her  as  a  family  visitor  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  It follows therefore the First-tier Tribunal had  no
    jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and should not have allowed it.

 4. I therefore set aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    substitute a decision dismissing the appeal.
