Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms M. Chowdhary, instructed by Mac Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr N. Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 21 January  1954.  She
    applied for entry clearance as a visitor, online, on 22 June 2013.  The
    hardcopy of her application and her fee were received by the respondent
    on 10 July 2013. The specific dates are important because as of 25 June
    2013 appeals against refusal of family visit visas may be brought  only
    on human rights grounds.

 2. The appellant's husband and five children live and are settled  in  the
    UK and the evidence of her son at the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ("FtT") was that the appellant wished to come to the UK for  a
    period of six months to visit them.

 3. The respondent refused the appellant's application for entry  clearance
    on the basis that the requirements of Paragraph 41 of  the  Immigration
    Rules were not met. It was not accepted that she genuinely intended  to
    leave the UK on completion of the proposed visit. The refusal of  entry
    clearance, dated 28 July 2013, stated that  her  right  of  appeal  was
    limited to the grounds in  section  84(1)(c)  of  the  Nationality  and
    Asylum Act 2002.

First-tier Tribunal decision and grounds of appeal

 4. The appellant appealed and her appeal was heard by FtT Judge Lobo.  The
    FtT found that the application for entry clearance was not received  by
    the respondent in a manner which allowed it to be  processed  until  10
    July 2013 and  therefore  there  was  no  right  of  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 5. The judge then considered the appeal, in the alternative, on the  basis
    that the appellant did have a right of appeal. The FtT  concluded  that
    the appellant could not satisfy the Rules. The reasons for  so  finding
    are set out only briefly, in paragraphs [16]- [18], where it is stated:

         "16. ... The appellant has failed to address the matters raised  by
         the respondent in the refusal.

         17.  There is no satisfactory evidence  of  the  financial  support
         which the appellant claims she receives from her relations  in  the
         United Kingdom; �725 over five years which  is  the  equivalent  to
         �145 per year. There is no  evidence  of  the  agricultural  income
         which the appellant claims she is given.

         18.  There is no satisfactory evidence of the appellant's financial
         and social circumstances in Bangladesh"

 6. The judge's consideration of Article 8 is equally brief. It is set  out
    in paragraph [19] which I have reproduced in full:

         19.  The appellant enjoys a family life with her children  and  her
         husband who live in the  UK,  and  has  done  so  for  many  years,
         notwithstanding their geographical distance  and  the  relationship
         that has clearly blossomed. There is no reason why this family life
         cannot continue. The refusal of the appellant's application  for  a
         visit visa does not interfere with her Article 8 rights.

 7. The grounds of appeal submit:

          a. there is a right of appeal under the Immigration Rules because
             the relevant date is the date the application was submitted on-
             line, not the date the fee was paid;

          b. the judge erred in his approach to the Immigration  Rules  by,
             inter alia, applying too high a burden of proof as  he  sought
             to ascertain a specific income when the Rules do not  identify
             a threshold requirement; and

          c. the judge erred by failing to recognise Article 8 was engaged.



Consideration

 8. The first issue is whether the appellant has a full right of appeal  or
    whether, instead, her appeal is limited to Article 8 of the ECHR.

 9. Under Section 52 of the Crime and  Courts  Act  2013,  appeals  against
    refusal of a family visit visa applied for on or after 25 June 2013 may
    be brought only on human rights grounds. The appellant made  on  online
    application on 22 June 2013 but did not pay the required fee  until  10
    July 2013. Accordingly, if the application was made on the date of  the
    online application she has a full right of appeal but if  it  was  made
    only when the fee was paid then her right of appeal is limited to human
    rights grounds.

10. The parties drew to  my  attention  the  following  provisions  in  the
    Immigration Rules:

         Paragraph 34(G)(iv): "the date on which an application ... is  made
         is ... where the application is made  via  the  online  application
         process, on the date on which the online application is submitted."



         Paragraph  A34(iii)(a)  "When  the  application  is  made  via  the
         relevant online process any specified fee in  connection  with  the
         application must be paid in accordance with the method specified."

11. Ms Chowdhary argued that the Immigration Rules do not specify the  role
    of a fee in validating an application and that under Paragraph  34G(iv)
    the relevant date when an application is made online  is  the  date  on
    which the online application is submitted. Mr  Bramble's  response  was
    that an application is not live, and therefore cannot  be  said  to  be
    "submitted", until the fee has been paid.

12. Paragraph 34(G)(iv) stipulates that an online application  is  made  on
    the date it is "submitted".  Submitted is not a defined term. The plain
    meaning of submitted, in the context of making an  online  application,
    is that the online application is "submitted" when it is electronically
    transmitted  to  the  recipient.   I  can  see  the   logic   in,   and
    attractiveness of, Mr Bramble's argument (and the finding of  the  FtT)
    that for an application requiring a fee to  be  fully  submitted,  such
    that it can be processed, the  fee  must  also  be  received.  However,
    Paragraphs 34(G)(iv) and A34(iii) do not state that the application  is
    not submitted until the fee is  received.  Taken  together,  and  given
    their ordinary meaning, these Rules provide that an online  application
    is made when it is submitted online, even if the fee  is  not  paid  at
    that time. Accordingly, the FtT  erred  in  law  by  finding  that  the
    appellant did not have a right of appeal under the  Immigration  Rules.
    That error was  not,  however,  material  as  the  FtT  considered  the
    appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules in the alternative.

13. The appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules  concerns  Paragraph
    41 of the Immigration Rules which sets out the requirements  for  leave
    to enter as a general visitor.  These include that a  visitor  must  be
    (a) genuinely seeking entry as a general visitor for a  limited  period
    and (b) intending to leave the UK at the  end  of  the  period  of  the
    visit.

14. The appellant is a 61 year old woman living in Bangladesh whose husband
    and five children live in the UK. She has not visited them -  and  they
    have not visited her - for many years. She lives on  agricultural  land
    owned by her husband, using the land's crops to  meet  her  needs.  She
    receives financial gifts from her husband and  children,  although  the
    extent of this is unclear, and she has previously been refused entry to
    the UK.

15. The respondent refused the appellant entry clearance on the basis  that
    it was not accepted she intended to leave the UK  after  her  trip.  In
    particular it was noted that:

          a. she was previously refused entry clearance on the ground  that
             she had more ties to the UK  than  Bangladesh  and  there  has
             since then been no significant change in circumstances; and

          b. she had failed to provide evidence of her financial and social
             circumstances in Bangladesh that would establish her intention
             to leave the UK

16. The FtT found that the appellant had  failed  to  address  the  matters
    raised by the respondent and that, in particular, there was no evidence
    of the appellant's financial and social circumstances in Bangladesh.

17. Ms Chowdhary submitted that the  FtT  reached  its  conclusion  without
    having regard to relevant evidence, in particular:

          a. The witness  statements  of  the  appellant's  children  which
             demonstrated that money was remitted to her primarily  through
             friends and relatives rather than through bank transfers;

          b. The witness statements of the appellant's children  confirming
             that she would be accommodated and maintained without recourse
             to public funds;

          c. The bank transfer forms showing money  being  transferred  and
             received by the appellant from her family in the UK;

          d. Her appellant's sons up to date bank  statements  showing  his
             financial ability to support her;

          e. The appellant's up to date finances showing savings of  almost
             �850;

          f. The official  land  registration  documentation  showing  land
             owned by the appellant's husband and the  evidence  of  family
             members that the appellant resides on her husband's  ancestral
             lands and property, from which  she  is  able  to  subsist  by
             eating the crops grown there

18. Ms Chowdhary argued that Paragraph 41 does not lay down an explicit sum
    of money that the appellant must have in  order  to  be  granted  entry
    clearance. Rather, the relevant question is whether the appellant  will
    be able to maintain and accommodate herself without recourse to  public
    funding. The evidence from her husband and children that was before the
    FtT was such that this  question  should  have  been  answered  in  the
    affirmative. Mr Bramble argued, in response, that  the  FtT  had  taken
    into consideration the relevant evidence and reached a conclusion  open
    to it under the Immigration Rules.

19. The FtT's decision, although  brief,  demonstrates  that  the  evidence
    before it was taken into consideration.  It is  apparent  at  paragraph
    [17] that the FtT had regard to  the  witness  evidence  pertaining  to
    financial support for the appellant (finding it to not be satisfactory)
    and the circumstances of the agricultural land upon which she  resides.
    Most importantly, the judge has considered  the  evidence  (or  absence
    thereof) concerning the appellant's ties to Bangladesh  as  opposed  to
    the UK which goes to the heart of the issue of whether she  intends  to
    leave the UK at the end of her stay.  The burden of proof  lay  on  the
    appellant to show only a genuine visit was intended. Given the evidence
    of her close relations to and desire to be with her family in  the  UK,
    and the lack of evidence to show why her links to Bangladesh were  such
    that she would wish to return after a visit the UK  despite  the  clear
    wish on her part and on that of her children in the UK for  her  to  be
    with her family in the UK,  it  was  open  to  the  FtT  to  reach  the
    conclusion that the appellant  did  not  satisfy  the  requirements  of
    Paragraph 41.

20. I now turn to Article 8 of the ECHR.  Article 8 in visitor appeals  was
    recently considered by the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Kaur  (visit  appeals,
    Article 8) [2015] UKUT 00487 (IAC), where the difficulty  of  making  a
    successful Article 8  claim  having  not  satisfied  Paragraph  41  was
    confirmed:

         "Unless an appellant can show that there are  individual  interests
         at stake covered by Article 8 "of a particularly  pressing  nature"
         so as to give rise to a strong claim that compelling  circumstances
         may exist to justify the grant of LTE outside the  rules"  (see  SS
         Congo at [40] and [56]), he is  exceedingly  unlikely  to  succeed.
         That proposition must also hold good in visitor appeals"

21. The FtT in this case has given Article 8 only cursory consideration and
    has stated that the absence of a visit visa does not interfere with the
    appellant's Article 8 rights.  For the reasons set out  below,  I  find
    that the FtT erred in its approach to Article 8 but that the error  was
    not material.

22. Although the appellant has not seen her husband and children in the  UK
    for many years, the evidence is that they enjoy  a  close  relationship
    where  the  children  provide  financial  support  to  her.  In   these
    circumstances I find that  the  ties  between  the  appellant  and  her
    children - and certainly between her and her husband - fall within  the
    scope of Article 8(1) and that denying the appellant the opportunity to
    visit her family in the UK interferes with her,  and  their,  right  to
    respect for family life.  Refusing the appellant entry, however, is not
    a disproportionate interference with that right.

23. Given the appellant does not satisfy the requirement of Paragraph 41 to
    show she intends only a  genuine  visit,  there  is  a  weighty  public
    interest in denying her entry (having regard, in particular, to Section
    117B(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002) that  only
    compelling   circumstances   will   overcome.   No   such    compelling
    circumstances have been shown in this  case  where  it  has  been,  and
    continues to be, open to the appellant's children and husband to  visit
    her in Bangladesh.

Decision

 a. The appeal is dismissed.

 b. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of a
    material error of law and shall stand.

 c. No anonymity order is made.
