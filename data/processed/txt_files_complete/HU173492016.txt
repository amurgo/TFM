                            DECISION AND REASONS

       Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 15th November 1964  who
       entered the UK as a spouse on 7th October 2013 with leave valid until
       11th April 2016. On 12th April 2016 she applied for indefinite  leave
       to remain based on her marriage.  Her application was  refused  in  a
       decision dated 1st July 2016. Her appeal  against  the  decision  was
       dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge N  Haria  in  a  determination
       promulgated on the 1st March 2019.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Blundell  on
       29th May 2019 and I found that the First-tier Tribunal had  erred  in
       law for the reasons set out in my decision at Annex A.

    3. The matter came before me to remake the Article 8 ECHR appeal outside
       of the Immigration Rules. The appellant attended the  Upper  Tribunal
       with her husband and  step-children.  She  and  her  step-daughter  T
       confirmed that their statements were true and their evidence  to  the
       Upper Tribunal, and T provided a brief update regarding her education
       orally in  response  to  examination  in  chief.  Mr  Melvin  had  no
       questions for the witnesses.

       Evidence & Submissions - Remaking

    4. In summary the evidence of the appellant from her  written  statement
       is as follows. She met her husband in a church  in  Nigeria  in  June
       2011, and they were married in March 2012 in Lagos, Nigeria. She came
       to the UK with entry clearance as a spouse in October 2013  and  went
       to live with her husband and his four  children  (A  born  in  August
       1991, TT born in August 1994, O born in July 1997 and T born in  June
       2002). When she joined the family  the  two  youngest  children  were
       under the age of 18 years. T was 11 years old at that  time,  and  is
       now 17 years old. T was born  in  the  UK  and  is  now  applying  to
       register as a British citizen. She has become a mother  figure  to  T
       and the other children, who all call her mother. There  is  no  other
       mother in their lives. She has cooked, washed and cleaned for all  of
       them since she came to the UK. She helped T to obtain  a  scholarship
       to a top independent school, namely City of London Freemen's  School,
       and also goes on trips with her to  places  such  as  Nottingham  and
       Manchester. For her to leave would have a profoundly negative  impact
       on T's education and well-being.

    5. In April 2016 the appellant applied to extend her leave as a  spouse.
       She believes that the refusal is wrong and particularly unfair on  T.
       She earns �17,000 per annum (her payslips in the appeal  bundle  show
       that she earned a gross salary of �17,746 in the  year  ending  April
       2019 from work with Acorn Lodge Care) and her husband has  an  income
       of �1,600 from his pension  (his  Barclays  bank  statements  from  a
       monthly pension of �136.36 paid into his account and thus  an  annual
       amount of �1636.32). They  are  not  reliant  on  any  benefits.  Her
       husband has lived in the UK for over 20 years, and all  the  children
       have been here for most of their lives.

    6. In summary the evidence of T from  her  written  statement  and  oral
       evidence is as follows. She was born in London in the UK on 13th June
       2002. She was granted indefinite leave to remain in October 2009. Her
       biological mother left her and her father when she was about 8  years
       old, in 2010, which made her very sad and lonely. Her father did  his
       best to care for her, but he struggled  and  she  felt  rejected  and
       upset. When her father married the appellant she was worried that she
       might take her father from her. However, from the  first  phone  call
       from Nigeria she found  the  appellant  welcoming  and  they  made  a
       connection. When the appellant came to the UK  in  October  2013  she
       became her mother figure and her best friend, and  as  a  result  she
       cannot imagine life without her. She has helped her get into City  of
       London Freemen's School, has attended parent's evenings,  funded  the
       costs of private maths tutoring, attended graduations and  taken  her
       on trips. She obtained 10 GCSEs and is now doing three  A  levels  in
       English, history and psychology. T hopes to study law at UCL  or  LSE
       in the future, and believes that she  would  not  have  imagined  she
       could do this without the appellant's support and encouragement.

    7. Mr Melvin's submissions  for  the  respondent  are,  in  summary,  as
       follows. Reliance is placed on the reasons for refusal  letter  dated
       1st July 2016. The starting point is the appellant cannot satisfy the
       Immigration Rules. It is however accepted that the appellant and  her
       husband have a genuine and subsisting relationship, and that there is
       a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship  between  T  and  the
       appellant. It is accepted that it would not be reasonable to expect T
       to leave the UK and also that the income of  the  appellant  and  her
       husband is currently  more  than  �18,600.  The  Upper  Tribunal  was
       invited to draw its own conclusions on the  appropriate  outcome  for
       this appeal.

    8. At the end of Mr Melvin's submissions I informed Mr  Waithe  that  he
       did not need to make any submissions  as  I  would  be  allowing  the
       appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds for the reasons which I now set  out
       in writing below.

       Conclusions - Remaking

    9. I have preserved the finding by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
       appellant could not  succeed  in  her  appeal  by  reference  to  the
       requirements of the Immigration  Rules.  I  therefore  consider  this
       appeal on general Article 8 ECHR  grounds,  by  way  of  a  balancing
       exercise  with  reference  to  the  framework  at   s.117B   of   the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

   10. My first consideration is  the  best  interests  of  the  child,  and
       therefore I turn to the provision at s.117B(6) of  the  2002  Act.  I
       find that T is a qualifying child as she has lived in the UK for more
       than 7 years.

   11. In R (RK) v SSHD (s.117B(6); "parental relationship") IJR [2016] UKUT
       31 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal approached  the  question  of  whether  a
       person  has  a  parental  relationship  (which  of  course  must   be
       considered  in  the  context  of  the  entire  phrase  "genuine   and
       subsisting parental relationship") with a child at [42]:

           "Whether a person is in a "parental relationship" with  a  child
           must, necessarily, depend on the individual circumstances. Those
           circumstances will include  what  role  they  actually  play  in
           caring for and making decisions in relation to the  child.  That
           is likely to be a most significant factor. However, it will also
           include whether that relationship arises because of their  legal
           obligations as a parent or in lieu of a  parent  under  a  court
           order or other  legal  obligation.  I  accept  that  it  is  not
           necessary for an individual to have "parental responsibility" in
           law for there  to  exist  a  "parental  relationship,"  although
           whether or not that is the case will be a relevant factor.  What
           is important is that the individual can establish that they have
           taken on the role that a "parent" usually plays in the  life  of
           their child."

   12.  I  find  that  appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
       relationship with T as T has  had  no  contact  with  her  biological
       mother since she was 8 years  old  and  the  appellant  has  entirely
       filled the role of mother  for  her,  and  her  siblings,  since  her
       arrival in the UK in October 2013, a period of nearly six years.  She
       has cared for her on a day to day basis; formed a loving relationship
       with her; taken the initiative on  issues  concerning  her  education
       including getting her a scholarship at a private school and arranging
       private tuition when that was necessary; and has inspired and support
       her in an ambitious career choice.

   13. The correct approach to reasonableness in this context is set out  in
       MA (Pakistan) V SSHD [2016] 1 WLR 5093, [2016] EWCA Civ 705.   I must
       determine whether it is reasonable to expect the T to leave  the  UK,
       in light of all the circumstances.  These include her best  interests
       on the one hand and any  countervailing  circumstances  such  as  the
       public interest in maintaining immigration control on the other.   In
       other words, the public interest must be balanced against the  impact
       upon the child when assessing reasonableness. I find  that  it  would
       not be reasonable to expect T to leave the UK as  she  has  lived  in
       this country all of her life ( a period of 17 years), has  indefinite
       leave to remain here and is applying to become a citizen. She has all
       of her private life ties with this country and is at a crucial  stage
       in her education, studying for A  levels  with  a  scholarship  at  a
       private school. She also has her father and three  siblings  in  this
       country, who are all lawfully present in this country with indefinite
       leave to remain. She lives with all of  these  family  members  in  a
       family home, and the family are not reliant on benefits and currently
       have an income of over �18,600, which I find means the  appellant  is
       financially self- sufficient.  So whilst I give weight  to  the  fact
       that the appellant did not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
       Rules, because at the time  of  application  the  appellant  and  her
       husband had not evidenced having sufficient funds, I  find  that  the
       fact that all persons in the family are lawfully  present,  the  fact
       that the appellant entered the UK lawfully  and  has  never  remained
       without leave and the weight of T's private and family life  ties  to
       this country means that it is not reasonable to expect T to leave.

   14. As such I find the requirements of s.117B(6) of the 2002 Act are met,
       and that there is no  public  interest  in  the  deportation  of  the
       appellant, and that therefore the interference with  her  family  and
       private life ties to the UK which removal represents would be clearly
       disproportionate.




Decision:

    1. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
       making of an error on a point of law.

    2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal but preserve  the
       findings with respect to the appellant being unable to show that  she
       meets the requirements of the Immigration rules.

    3. I remake the appeal by allowing the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

Annex A: Error of Law Decision



DECISION AND REASONS

       Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 15th November 1964  who
       entered the UK as a spouse on 7th October 2013 with leave valid until
       11th April 2016. On 12th April 2016 she applied for indefinite  leave
       to remain based on her marriage.  Her application was  refused  in  a
       decision dated 1st July 2016. Her appeal  against  the  decision  was
       dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge N  Haria  in  a  determination
       promulgated on the 1st March 2019.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Blundell  on
       29th May 2019 on the basis that it was arguable that  the  First-tier
       judge had erred in law in failing  to  consider  the  fact  that  the
       minimum income requirement was found to be met in  substance  and  in
       concluding that the appellant should apply  for  an  entry  clearance
       when it was also found that the departure of the appellant  from  the
       UK would result in the income of the couple falling below the minimum
       income requirement.

    3. The matter  came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

       Submissions - Error of Law

    4. The grounds of appeal lodged by Edward Marshall Solicitors  (E1)  are
       very hard to understand. In summary it is thought that it is  perhaps
       argued that the  decision  is  flawed  given  the  finding  that  the
       appellant met the financial threshold despite failing to  fulfil  all
       of the requirements of Appendix FM-SE. It is also perhaps argued that
       the respondent might have mislaid documents which led  to  the  self-
       employed income of the sponsor  being  disregarded  and  issues  with
       accepting the income from a Tesco pension, and that  there  had  been
       miscalculations by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

    5. At the hearing it was accepted by Ms Ofei-Kwatia, who had  been  very
       recently instructed by new solicitors, namely Mascot Solicitors, that
       the only live contention was that  the  decision  on  the  appeal  on
       Article 8 ECHR outside of the Immigration  Rules  erred  in  law.  Ms
       Cunha accepted that there were errors in  that  part  of  the  appeal
       decision although she submitted it may ultimately be that the outcome
       of the appeal will be the same. She consented to the amendment of the
       grounds so that the failure  to  weigh  the  best  interests  of  the
       appellant's partner's child (T) in the proportionality exercise could
       also be added as a contended error of law.

    6. It was agreed by both parties that it would be appropriate to adjourn
       the remaking hearing as Ms Ofei-Kwatia's instructing  solicitors  had
       not yet received the file from Edward Marshall Solicitors, and so had
       not been able to prepared for this aspect of  the  hearing,   and  in
       light of the fact that the previous solicitors had failed to  put  in
       relevant material regarding the best interest of the child and  other
       matters.

       Conclusions - Error of law

    7. The First-tier Tribunal provides a clear and coherent analysis of the
       financial evidence provided in this case at paragraphs 27  to  37  of
       the decision, and it is lawfully  and  properly  concluded  that  the
       appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules due to  a  failure  to
       provide  the  specified  documents  under  Appendix  FM-SE   of   the
       Immigration Rules. The decision on this aspect is preserved.

    8. I find however that the  treatment  of  the  appeal  outside  of  the
       Immigration Rules errs in law. The fact that the appellant was  found
       to have income well above the minimum income requirement of  �18,600,
       see paragraphs 37 and 38  of  the  decision,  was  not  given  proper
       consideration given what is said at  paragraphs  99  and  100  of  MM
       Lebanon v UKSC [2017] UKSC 10 about looking at what would lead  to  a
       lack of financial burden on the state in a less  rigid  fashion  when
       conducting a general Article 8 ECHR consideration. There was also  an
       error in concluding at paragraph  72  of  the  decision  that  little
       weight  could  be  given  to  the  appellant's  family  life  with  a
       qualifying partner  as  her  stay  was  precarious  by  reference  to
       s.117B(4) or (5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,
       as these provisions only apply to those who are unlawfully present or
       to the private life ties of someone with precarious status. There  is
       also an error in treating the fact that the appellant could return to
       the UK via an entry clearance application  at  paragraph  75  of  the
       decision as a relevant consideration when  at  paragraph  73  of  the
       decision it was found that that she would not  qualify,  and  in  any
       case it is not a relevant consideration to place the  outcome  of  an
       entry clearance application in the balance.



Decision:

    1. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
       making of an error on a point of law.

    2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal but preserve  the
       findings with respect to the appellant being unable to show that  she
       meets the requirements of the Immigration rules.

    3. I adjourn the re-making of this appeal  outside  of  the  Immigration
       Rules on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

Directions

    1. Any further evidence for the remaking hearing will be filed with  the
       Upper Tribunal and served on the respondent  no  less  than  10  days
       prior to the hearing date.
