                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

1. The appellant, a Pakistani citizen, has permission to appeal against  the
   First-tier Tribunal determination dismissing his appeal  against  refusal
   of entry clearance as a partner under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
   Rules.  A hearing has been fixed for 9 September 2014.

2. By a letter dated 5 August 2014, the appellant's  representatives  stated
   that they were instructed to withdraw the appeal  because  the  appellant
   had submitted a fresh settlement application, in  order  to  save  costs.
   Pursuant to paragraph 17 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
   2008 (as amended), the permission of the Upper Tribunal is  required  for
   such withdrawal.

3. On behalf of the Upper Tribunal, I consent to that withdrawal.  There  is
   therefore now no valid appeal before the Tribunal.
