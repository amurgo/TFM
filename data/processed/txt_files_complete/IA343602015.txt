Representation:

For the Appellant:     No attendance
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 24 April 1973.  On 30
    October 2014 he applied for indefinite leave to remain in the UK on the
    basis of ten years' residence.  On 18 March 2015 his application was
    refused.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. His appeal was heard
    by Judge Hussain who, in a decision promulgated on 7 March 2017,
    dismissed the appeal.

 3. In the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant
    pursued a claim under Article 8 ECHR outwith the Immigration Rules,
    contending, inter alia, that removing him from the UK would breach
    Article 8 ECHR because he has two daughters who are British citizens.

 4. Notwithstanding that in the appellant's bundle were photocopies of the
    British passports of his daughters, the First-tier Tribunal stated that
    the appellant's daughters "are without any leave" and made no reference
    to their British citizenship.

 5. Before me, Mr Duffy conceded that (a) the judge had made an error of
    law in failing to recognise that the appellant's children were British
    and; (b) having regard to the Immigration Directorate Instructions
    Family Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0b, he accepted that the appeal
    should be allowed under Article 8 on the basis of the appellant's
    relationship with his British national children.  He advised that the
    Secretary of State was withdrawing its objection to the appeal.

 6. Accordingly, I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and
    remake the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal under Article 8
    ECHR.

Notice of Decision

   7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of
      law and is set aside.


   8. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.


   9. No anonymity direction is made.
