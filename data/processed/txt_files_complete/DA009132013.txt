Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Jegarajah, Counsel, instructed by Prime
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the determination of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge (First-tier Tribunal Judge Eldridge and Ms  S
    E Singer) promulgated on 2 July 2013 dismissing his appeal against  the
    decision of the respondent pursuant to section 32 (5) of the UK Borders
    Act 2007 to deport him.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 31 May 1980,  and  it  is
    his case that he arrived here to join his mother at the age of  twelve.
    On 10 February 2003, he was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain  ("ILR")
    under the regularisation of overstayers scheme. On 2 July 2012  he  was
    convicted of conspiracy to make false representations, and on 24 August
    2012 was sentenced to 21 months in prison.  In reply to  the  enquiries
    from the respondent as to why  he  should  not  now  be  deported,  the
    appellant explained that he was in a relationship with Ms Carlie Jones,
    and that he had two children in the United Kingdom, both  of  whom  are
    British Citizens, but from different mothers.

 3. The appellant's case as put to the First-tier Tribunal that he is in  a
    relationship with Ms K M and that they have a daughter K, born in 2008.
    He also has another daughter, M, born in 2009; her mother is Ms R.  The
    appellant's case is that he has no  ties  with  Nigeria,  and  that  to
    deport him there would not be in the best interests of his children and
    would be in breach of his protected rights, contrary to  article  8  of
    the Human Rights Convention.

 4. The respondent accepts that the appellant is the father of  K  but  did
    not accept that he is still in a relationship with Ms K M. She did  not
    accept that he was in a genuine and  subsisting  parental  relationship
    with M. For these reasons, she concluded that  the  appellant  did  not
    meet the criteria set out in paragraph 399(a) of the Immigration Rules.



 5. The respondent did  not  accept  either  that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 399 (b) as he had not shown that he was in  a
    subsisting relationship with Ms Carlie  Jones,  or  that  he  had  been
    living in the United Kingdom continuously with leave for 15 years.

 6. In addition, the respondent considered that the appellant did not  meet
    the requirements of paragraph 399A of the immigration rules, as he  had
    not shown that he had lived continuously in the United Kingdom  for  at
    least 20 years, nor had he shown that he had no ties to Nigeria.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from the appellant and Ms  K  M,
    it being their evidence that they were now in a relationship again. The
    appellant explained that his relationship with Ms Carlie Jones had come
    into being when he and K M had had a mis-understanding.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal on all grounds, finding:

      i) That the appellant was not a credible witness [51], [52];  that  he
         was prepared to take up with and abandon women as he chooses  [54];
         that it was not the appellant's intention  to  form  or  re-form  a
         long-term relationship with K M [54] and that they  had  not  lived
         together since at the latest 2010 [56];  that  the  appellant  does
         not have strong and committed relationship with Ms K M ,  Ms  R  or
         Carlie Jones [59]; that he does have a continuing relationship with
         K, but that he did not have any family life with M;

     ii) That there was nothing to imply that  the  appellant  was  anything
         other than a low risk offender  who  did  not  present  a  risk  of
         serious harm to the public [61];

    iii) That although the appellant has many  family  members  and  friends
         here, and has lived here for most of the last 20  years,  they  did
         not accept that he had no-one to turn to in Nigeria [62];

     iv) That the appellant could not succeed under paragraphs 399 (a),  399
         (b) or 399A of the Immigration Rules [63],[64];

      v) That there was a strong public interest in deporting the  appellant
         [70], [71]; that it was in K's best interests to have  a  committed
         father in her life [76], but that her interests were in  this  case
         outweighed by the public interest in deporting him [79];

 9. The appellant sought permission to appeal against this decision on  the
    grounds that the First-tier Tribunal had erred on four grounds:

      i) Ground 1: In failing to note that as the appellant had  in  meeting
         the terms of the  Regularisation  of  Overstayers  scheme  shown  a
         successful article 8 claim and thus for the 10 years prior  to  the
         grant to him in 2003 of ILR, his residence  had  been  lawful  [9];
         and, had erred in failing to take the basis of  the  grant  of  ILR
         into account in assessing the nature  of  the  appellant's  private
         life [10]

     ii)  Ground  2:  In  failing  properly  to  apply  Uner  v  Netherlands
         (46410/99), as by its proper application [13] 20 years residence is
         sufficient to render removal disproportionate;

    iii) Ground 3: In failing to identify or apply  properly  the  principle
         established in Maslov [2008] ECHR  546  at  [75]  that  "a  settled
         migrant who has lawfully spent all or the major part of his or  her
         childhood and youth in the host country, very serious  reasons  are
         required to justify expulsion" and  thus  rendering  the  balancing
         exercise under article 8 flawed [21];

     iv) Ground 4: In failing to make an adequate finding whether there  was
         a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship   between   the
         appellant  and  child;  and,  in  failing  thus  to   give   proper
         consideration to the best interests of the child,  and  failing  to
         consider the impact on her over and above the fact that there would
         be a parent within the United Kingdom to care  for  her,  and  thus
         failing properly to apply Ogundimu (article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria
         [2013] UKUT 60 (IAC).

10. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Frankish on 1 August 2013 on all grounds. Subsequent  to
    that, on 2  September  2013,  the  respondent  replied  to  the  grant,
    challenging each specific ground.

Submissions

11. Ms Jegarajah formally withdrew Ground 2  of  her  grounds.  Turning  to
    ground 1, she submitted that  the  First-tier  tribunal  had  erred  in
    failing to taken into account the quality of the  appellant's  life  in
    the United Kingdom, as well as its length, and that fact  that  it  had
    been recognised by  the  grant  of  ILR  under  the  Regularisation  of
    Overstayers Scheme was important as it flowed from  this  that  he  had
    established  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  respondent  that  he   had
    sufficient ties to the United Kingdom.

12. Ms Jegarajah submitted that the panel had erred in failing to  consider
    the dicta in Maslov that there needed to be very serious reasons why  a
    person resident for 20 years should be deported, and  that  in  such  a
    case, the respondent's case must be all the stronger.

13. Ms Jegarajah sought permission to expand Ground 4 to  which  request  I
    acceded in the absence of any objection on the part of the  respondent.
    The ground was expanded to permit  the  argument  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  had  erred  in  failing  to   enquire   properly   into   the
    circumstances of the child, K, and in particular, failing to take  into
    account the effect that her father's deportation would have on her. She
    was, however, unable to direct me beyond the letter from  Ms  Winfield,
    or the mother's statement, as to what had been put  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, if anything, in respect of  this  issue.  She  did,  however,
    submit that they had considered too narrow a framework, and that it was
    reasonable to have concluded that, were the appellant to  remain  here,
    that there would be emotional and financial stability for the family.

14. Mr Deller submitted that, relying on D v SSHD [2012]  EWCA  Civ  39  at
    [32], the appellant's presence here  was  either  lawful  or  unlawful,
    asking me to note that Ms Jegarajah had accepted that the grant of  ILR
    in 2003 did not render lawful the appellant's  residence  between  1993
    and 2003.    He submitted further that this was not a Maslov case,  and
    that the First-tier Tribunal had correctly distinguished it.

15. Turning to Ground 4, Mr Deller submitted that the  adverse  credibility
    findings should be borne in mind, and the strong indications  that  the
    family would not remain as a unit. He  submitted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had taken a proper view of the interests of the children,  and
    that it needs to be borne in mind that best interests of the  children,
    even if they do suffer, can be outweighed by the public interest.

16. In reply, Ms Jegarajah submitted that looking at the case as  a  whole,
    the First-tier Tribunal had not properly assessed the  situation  of  K
    who is a vulnerable child. She submitted further that, given the nature
    of the section 55  duty  as  enunciated  in  SS  (Sri  Lanka)  v  SSHD,
    safeguarding that child is something with which I should  be  concerned
    and that additional evidence, including a report from a  social  worker
    which is now available, should be taken into account.

Does the determination of the First-tier Tribunal involve the making  of  an
error of law?

17. I turn first to Ms Jegarajah's final submissions first.  In  MA  (Fresh
    evidence)  Sri  Lanka  *  [2004]  UKIAT  00161the  IAT  stated,   after
    considering E v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 49:-

           23(ii) New evidence will normally be admitted only in accordance
           with 'Ladd v Marshall principles' (see Ladd v Marshall [1954]  1
           WLR 1489), applied with some additional  flexibility  under  the
           CPR (see Hertfordshire Investments Ltd v Bubb [2000] 1 WLR 2318,
           2325; White Book para 52.11.2). The Ladd v  Marshall  principles
           are, in summary: first, that the fresh evidence could  not  have
           been obtained with reasonable diligence for use  at  the  trial;
           secondly, that if given, it probably would have had an important
           influence on the result; and, thirdly,  that  it  is  apparently
           credible although not necessarily incontrovertible. As a general
           rule, the fact that the failure to adduce the evidence was  that
           of the party's legal advisers provides no excuse: see Al-Mehdawi
           v Home Secretary [1990] 1AC 876."
   1. The Court of Appeal pointed out that  it  was  not  dealing  with  the
      current jurisdiction of the Tribunal which is limited  to  hearing  an
      appeal on a point of law. However, we see no reason  why  the  general
      principles governing the reception of evidence which  was  not  before
      the Adjudicator should be different. There is no reason why the  first
      and third principles should be changed. The application of the  second
      principle will be different. When applied in the context of an  appeal
      on the ground of error of fact or law, the fresh evidence  has  to  be
      such that it would probably have had an  important  influence  on  the
      result of the factual or legal conclusions of  the  Adjudicator.  When
      applied in the context of  error  of  law  alone,  the  test  for  the
      relevance of fresh evidence which could and should  have  been  before
      the Adjudicator cannot now be that it assists a challenge  to  factual
      conclusions  such  as   credibility   findings   or   other   personal
      circumstances which are very much matters  for  the  Adjudicator.  The
      application of the second principle now requires that the evidence  be
      relevant to showing that the Adjudicator made an error of  law,  which
      probably had an important influence on the result.

18. Whilst there is a duty on the Upper Tribunal when considering the  best
    interests of a child to treat those as a primary consideration, what is
    in issue here is whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law, I do not
    accept that any positive duty towards the rights of the child K in this
    case are such that, in the light of these principles, I should consider
    evidence not before the First-tier Tribunal. I do not consider that the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in SS (Sri Lanka) v  SSHD  [2012]  EWCA
    Civ 945 is  authority  for  that  proposition  or  that  that  case  is
    authority for the proposition that either the First-tier or  the  Upper
    Tribunal have a duty pursuant to section 55 of the UK Borders Act. On a
    proper analysis, the decision is authority  only  for  the  proposition
    that the Tribunal should have considered  the  best  interests  of  the
    child which, in SS (Sri Lanka) they had not done. Here, they did so. In
    the circumstances, therefore, I have not considered any of the material
    submitted which was not before the First-tier Tribunal.

19. I turn next to the grounds of appeal (as  amended)  in  turn,  omitting
    Ground 2 which has been withdrawn

    Ground 1

20. The Regularisation of Overstayers Scheme was introduced to preserve the
    rights of those who were,  at  the  commencement  of  the  Immigration,
    Nationality and Asylum Act 1999, overstayers, and who,  prior  to  that
    would have faced deportation under section 3 (5) (a) of the 1971 Act as
    originally  enacted.  The  factors   set   out   in   the   Immigration
    (Regularisation Period for Overstayers) Regulations 2009 simply  repeat
    the factors that the respondent  would  have  had  to  consider  before
    deciding to deport such a person.  Those factors  overlap  considerably
    with an article 8 consideration, but are not co-terminous, contrary  to
    Ms Jegarajah's submissions.

21. The First-tier Tribunal records [73]:

    This appellant has been I this country since he was  aged  12  and  was
    here lawfully, so far as we can ascertain, until 2012, a period  of  19
    years. The majority of his childhood and youth was spent in Nigeria..."

22. The  Tribunal,  therefore,  as  Mr  Deller  submitted,  considered  the
    appellant's case as higher than it was, given that as Ms Jegarajah  has
    effectively accepted that the appellant did not have leave between  the
    first six months of his time here, and 2003, a gap of roughly 9 to 9  �
    years. In the light of D v SSHD at [17], I consider it is not  arguable
    that the appellant's presence in this country was  lawful  between  his
    initial leave to enter and the grant of ILR in 2003.

    Ground 3

23. It follows from the above that the appellant  had  not  spent  anything
    like 20 years lawfully resident in the United Kingdom.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not err in failing to consider the dicta at [75]  set  out
    at  paragraph  9  above.  They  gave  adequate  consideration  to   the
    appellant's private life, attaching weight to it in their determination
    [80]. I consider that the panel  gave  adequate  consideration  to  the
    appellant's private  life  and  its  content,  given  the  unchallenged
    negative findings regarding his credibility.

    Ground 4

24. The First-tier Tribunal found that the appellant has a family life with
    K [74]; that there were no concerns with  regard  to  her  safeguarding
    [75]; and, that it is in her interest that she had a  committed  father
    in her  life  [76].  They  then  directed  themselves  properly  as  to
    assessing the interests of K, taking specific note of section  1(3)  of
    the Children Act 1989 [76].  They noted also that [79]  that  K's  life
    will be unable to develop as it would if the appellant had remained  in
    this country.

25. Contrary to Ms Jegarajah's forceful submissions on this issue,  is  not
    evident from the letters from Ms Winfield or Ms K  M  that,  given  the
    findings the panel had reached about the appellant, that they erred  in
    failing properly to  take  into  account  any  issue  regarding  K.  Ms
    Jegarajah was unable to take me to any specific issue which was raised,
    and I do not consider that it was incumbent on the First-tier  Tribunal
    to undertake an inquisitorial role as she submitted. It is not  evident
    that it was put to the Tribunal that K's emotional situation  would  be
    more stable, or that the family's situation would be better. There  are
    a  substantial  number  of  issues  which  would  have  to  have   been
    considered, not all of them in the appellant's favour; The panel  found
    [59] that the appellant was not committed to Ms KM. That finding is not
    challenged, and it is not arguable that the continuing stability of the
    family or potential earnings from the appellant of Ms K  M  would  have
    contributed to that.

26. In summary, the First-tier Tribunal did not err in their evaluation  of
    K's  best  interests,  treating  them  as  they  did   as   a   primary
    consideration in line with SS (Nigeria). The Tribunal  directed  itself
    properly as to the law, attaching appropriate and permissible weight to
    the factors to be taken into account, and reached  a  conclusion  which
    was open to them on the facts and for which they gave adequate reasons.



27. Accordingly, the determination did not involve the making of  an  error
    of law by the First-tier Tribunal capable of affecting the outcome  and
    I uphold it.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

 1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making
    of an error of law capable of affecting the outcome of  the  appeal.  I
    uphold the determination of the First-tier Tribunal
