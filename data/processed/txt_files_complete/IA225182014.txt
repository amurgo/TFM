                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the claimant: Mr P Collins, instructed by David A Grand
For the respondent:    MS A Weller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Lawrencia Aboagye, date of birth 14.11.78, is  a  citizen
    of Ghana.

 2. This is the remaking of  the  decision  in  the  appeal  following  the
    successful appeal of the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Metzer  promulgated  15.1.15,  allowing  on
    Article 8 human  rights  grounds  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State, dated 14.5.14, to  refuse  to  vary
    leave to enter or remain and to remove  her  from  the  UK  by  way  of
    directions under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
    Act 2006 .  The First-tier Tribunal Judge heard the appeal on 16.12.14.



 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.2.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 14.7.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  For the  reasons  set  out  in  my  error  of  law  decision
    promulgated 31.7.15 I found such error of law  in  the  making  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal that it should  be  set  aside  and
    remade.

 5. In summary, I found that the judge failed to explain why relocation  to
    Ghana would be unreasonable, or why the decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State was disproportionate. The judge incorrectly focused  on  why  the
    family should not leave the UK rather than asking what would happen  on
    return. The  judge  also  gave  incorrect  weight  to  factors  in  the
    proportionality balancing exercise and failed  to  address  the  public
    interest factors of section 117B of  the  2002  Act.   The  judge  also
    failed to address the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  before
    going on to consider family life under Article 8 ECHR and identified no
    compelling reasons for doing so.

 6. The appeal came back before me as  a  resumed/continuation  hearing  on
    28.8.15 for the remaking of the decision in the appeal.  The  appellant
    served a revised bundle comprising 302  pages,  together  with  witness
    statements. I confirm that I have carefully considered all the evidence
    before me, including the oral evidence and submissions of  the  parties
    before reaching any of the findings or conclusions.

 7. The full chronology  and  background  is  set  out  in  Judge  Metzer's
    decision. In essence, the claimant first had leave to enter and  remain
    as the spouse of a student migrant. She made an application in 2010 for
    an EEA residence card on the basis of what  was  a  bogus  marriage  to
    Alusine Sesay, a French national,  despite  remaining  married  to  her
    husband Richard Aboagye. An imposter used Mr Sesay's identity card, the
    fraud was discovered and the application was refused. Nevertheless, the
    claimant was granted discretionary leave to remain  outside  the  Rules
    until 31.12.13 for the express  purpose  of  being  a  witness  in  the
    prosecution of the immigration  fraud  involving  bogus  marriages.  It
    transpired through questioning of Mr Aboagye at the hearing  before  me
    that he was also involved in a bogus marriage application, claiming  to
    be married to an EEA national. His application was also refused.

 8. During the latter period of leave referred to  above,  on  16.7.13  the
    claimant made an application for  leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of
    Article  8  family  life  with  Mr  Aboagye  and  her  children.   That
    application and a subsequent application made on 5.12.13, which is  the
    subject of this appeal, were refused. At the date  of  application  the
    claimant, Mr Aboagye, and their children all had leave  to  remain.  Mr
    Aboagye had leave to remain under an EEA Residence  Card.  He  has  now
    made a separate human rights application and is awaiting  the  decision
    of the Secretary of State.

 9. The claimant and her family members have been in the UK for a period in
    excess of 10 years. Their daughter Chelsea has been in the UK since the
    age of 3 and is now 14 years of age. The other children  were  born  in
    the UK.

10. From the witness statements and oral evidence of the  claimant  and  Mr
    Aboagaye, a full note of which is with the  case  papers,  I  find  the
    follow particularly significant. It is asserted that the family has set
    down significant roots in the UK and the claimant suggests that removal
    of Chelsea  would  have  a  significant  impact  with  emotional  harm,
    detrimental to their well-being. Reference is made the documents in the
    appeal bundle, including school reports, letters and  other  documents,
    as well as photographs. I take into  account  that  Chelsea  will  have
    little recollection of Ghana and the younger children know only the UK,
    but they will have the association and support of their family  in  the
    transition to life in Ghana. It is a common feature of modern life that
    children frequently have to relocate, changing schools, leaving  behind
    friends and the environment they know,  when  parents  relocate  either
    within the UK or abroad.

11. It is also relevant  that  both  the  claimant  and  Mr  Aboagaye  have
    extensive family remaining in  Ghana,  including  parents  and  several
    siblings. I found the  claimant's  evidence  suggesting  that  she  had
    limited contact with her family not credible. She claims that she  last
    spoke to her siblings some 6 months ago, because they are busy and  all
    over the place. She claimed that they could not live  with  or  receive
    support from any of the family because they are all over the place. She
    also stated that she could not return to live with her father or mother
    as he had sexually abused her in the past. She claimed she didn't  know
    when her husband last had any contact with his parents.

12. Neither the claimant nor Mr Aboagaye are currently employed in the  UK.
    They are dependent on financial  support  from  friends  and  a  church
    organisation. He stated that his father is almost  80  and  has  had  a
    stroke and his mother, 67, has a stomach  ulcer  and  requires  serious
    medication. His sisters have all moved abroad. He said he would not  be
    able to find employment in Ghana because he had never worked there  and
    came to the UK as a student. He said it  would  be  difficult  to  find
    accommodation and living costs were expensive in  Ghana.  Contradicting
    his wife's evidence, he said that she does speak to them and they phone
    her regularly.

13. I am required by section 55 to have regard to the best interests of the
    children as a primary consideration, taking into account the extent  of
    their integration  into  life  in  the  UK.  However,  in  making  that
    assessment I have to take account of the recent case law bearing on the
    best interests of children, notably Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC  74,  EV
    (Philippines) & Ors v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874,  and  Azimi-Moayed  and
    others (decisions  affecting  children;  onward  appeals)  [2013]  UKUT
    197(IAC).

14. In Azimi-Moyed the Upper  Tribunal  in  considering  the  case  law  in
    relation to  decisions  affecting  children  identified  the  following
    principles to assist in the determination of appeals where children are
    affected by the appealed decisions:

         "i) As a starting point it is in the best interests of children  to
         be with both their parents and if both parents  are  being  removed
         from the United Kingdom then the starting point  suggests  that  so
         should dependent children who form part of their  household  unless
         there are reasons to the contrary.

         ii) It is generally in the  interests  of  children  to  have  both
         stability and continuity of social and  educational  provision  and
         the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of the  society  to
         which they belong.

         iii) Lengthy residence in a country other than the state of  origin
         can lead to development of social  cultural  and  educational  ties
         that it would be  inappropriate  to  disrupt,  in  the  absence  of
         compelling  reason  to  the  contrary.  What  amounts  to   lengthy
         residence is not clear cut  but  past  and  present  policies  have
         identified seven years as a relevant period.

         iv) Apart from the terms  of  published  policies  and  rules,  the
         Tribunal notes that seven years from age four is likely to be  more
         significant to a child than the first seven  years  of  life.  Very
         young children are focussed on  their  parents  rather  than  their
         peers and are adaptable.

         v) Short periods of residence, particularly ones without  leave  or
         the reasonable expectation of  leave  to  enter  or  remain,  while
         claims are promptly  considered,  are  unlikely  to  give  rise  to
         private life deserving of respect in  the  absence  of  exceptional
         factors. In any event, protection of  the  economic  well-being  of
         society amply justifies removal in such cases."

15. In Zoumbas v SSHD, the fact that the children were not British citizens
    and thus had no right to future education and health care  in  the  UK,
    together with the assessment of other factors, did not  create  such  a
    strong case for the children that their interest in remaining in the UK
    could have outweighed the considerations on which  the  Home  Secretary
    had relied in striking the balance  in  the  proportionality  exercise.
    There was in that case no irrationality in the conclusion that  it  was
    in the children's best interests  to  go  with  their  parents  to  the
    Republic of Congo.

         "No doubt it would have been possible to have  stated  that,  other
         things being equal, it was in the best interests  of  the  children
         that they and their parents stayed in the UK  so  that  they  could
         obtain such  benefits  as  health  care  and  education  which  the
         decision-maker recognised might be of a higher standard than  would
         be available in the Congo. But other things were  not  equal.  They
         were not British citizens. They had no right  to  future  education
         and health care in this country. They were  part  of  a  close-knot
         family with highly educated parents and were of an age  when  their
         emotional needs could only be fully met within the immediate family
         unit. Such integration as had occurred in  UK  society  would  have
         been predominantly in the context of the family unit."

16. It was also stated in that case that it was legitimate for the decision-
    maker to ask first whether it would have been proportionate  to  remove
    the parents if they had no children, and then, in considering the  best
    interests of the children in the proportionality exercise, ask  whether
    their well-being altered that provisional balance.

17. In EV (Philippines) & Ors, the Court of Appeal held that  in  answering
    the question whether it is in the best interests of a child  to  remain
    the longer the child has been in the UK the  greater  the  weight  that
    falls into one side of the scales. But, "In the balance  on  the  other
    side there falls to be taken into account the strong weight to be given
    to the need to maintain immigration control in pursuit of the  economic
    well-being of  the  country  and  the  fact  that,  ex  hyopthesi,  the
    applicants have no entitlement to remain. "If it is overwhelmingly  the
    child's best interests that he should not return, the need to  maintain
    immigration control may well not tip the balance. By contrast, if it is
    in the child's best interests to remain, but only on balance (with some
    factors pointing the other way), the result may be the opposite."

18. The Court of Appeal pointed out at �60 that the facts of the case  were
    a long way from those of ZH (Tanzania):

         "In our case none of the family is a British citizen. None has  the
         right to remain in this country. If  the  mother  is  removed,  the
         father has no independent right  to  remain.  If  the  parents  are
         removed, then it is entirely reasonable to expect the  children  to
         go with them. As the immigration judge found  it  is  obviously  in
         their best interests to remain with their parents. Although it  is,
         of course a question of fact for the Tribunal, I  cannot  see  that
         the desirability of being educated at public expense in the UK  can
         outweigh the benefit  to  the  children  of  remaining  with  their
         parents. Just as we cannot provide medical treatment for the world,
         so we cannot educate the world."

19. At �61, the Court continued,

         "In fact the immigration judge weighed the best  interests  of  the
         children as  a  primary  consideration,  and  set  against  it  the
         economic well-being of the country. As Maurice Kay LJ  pointed  out
         in AE (Algeria) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 653, at  [9]  in  conducting
         that exercise it would have been appropriate to consider  the  cost
         to the public purse in providing education to  these  children.  In
         fact that was not something that the immigration  judge  explicitly
         considered. If anything, therefore, the immigration  judge  adopted
         an approach too favourable to the appellant."

20. Whilst I take account of their integration with life,  and  society  in
    the UK, and the  education  the  children  have  received  here,  fully
    accepting that they are doing well at school, I must also take  account
    of the guidance in EA (Article 8 - best interests of the child) Nigeria
    [2011] UKUT 315, where the Upper Tribunal held that the analysis of the
    best interests of the children entirely through the prism of the  right
    to education was too narrow an approach. I bear in mind that whilst the
    elder child has lived in the UK some 10 years from the age of 3 and the
    two younger children were born in the UK, they are not British citizens
    and have no right to  residence  or  education  in  the  UK  except  in
    compliance with immigration rules. As stated above, in Zoumbas v  SSHD,
    the fact that the children were not British citizens and  thus  had  no
    right to future education and health care in the UK, together with  the
    assessment of other factors, did not create such a strong case for  the
    children that  their  interest  in  remaining  in  the  UK  could  have
    outweighed the considerations on which the Home Secretary had relied in
    striking the balance in the proportionality exercise.

21. In Mundeba (s55 & Parap 297) [2013] UKUT 88 (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal
    held that if parents are being removed the starting point  is  that  so
    should the children, unless there are reasons to the contrary.

22. In the light of the case guidance set out above,  taking  into  account
    those factors identified in the evidence before me,  I  find  that  the
    best interests of each of the children are to remain with their parents
    in a single family unit, whether that is in Ghana or the UK.  There  is
    no question here of splitting the family. Put another way,  if  any  of
    the children can succeed in establishing a right to remain in  the  UK,
    then the rest of the family must also be allowed to remain.  I  do  not
    find that the circumstances of any of the children either  individually
    or collectively are such as to render their best interests to remain in
    the UK despite the fact, as found below, that  their  parents  have  no
    legitimate basis for doing so.

23. I take into account that neither the claimant nor  any  member  of  the
    family can meet the Immigration Rules for leave to remain on the  basis
    of either Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules,  as
    accepted by Mr Collins.

24. In relation to private life under paragraph 276ADE of  the  Immigration
    Rules, neither the claimant nor Mr Aboagaye can meet the  requirements.
    The first reason they fail under this provision is that both fall  foul
    of the suitability  requirement.  Their  presence  in  the  UK  is  not
    conducive to the public good because their conduct  and  character,  in
    attempting to deceive the authorities by bogus EEA applications,  makes
    it undesirable to allow them to remain in the UK. Further, they  cannot
    demonstrate that they have lost all ties to  Ghana,  including  family,
    cultural or social, or that there are  very  significant  obstacles  to
    their integration in Ghana. They have both spent the majority of  their
    lives in Ghana, where they have family members.

25. In relation to the children, the oldest child Chelsea meets the  7-year
    threshold  requirement  under  paragraph  276ADE,  but  it  has  to  be
    demonstrated that it would be unreasonable to expect her to  leave  the
    UK with her family. In this regard, in addition to  those  matters  set
    out elsewhere herein, I  have  to  bear  in  mind  that  she  would  be
    returning to Ghana with her family members,  to  a  country  where  the
    language is English and there is a functioning education  system.  They
    have no right to education or continued residence in the UK.  There  is
    no reason why Chelsea or her siblings would not  be  able  to  continue
    education in Ghana whilst having the full support of the  rest  of  the
    family unit. In the circumstances, there is nothing to demonstrate that
    it would be unreasonable to expect her to leave the UK with her family.



26. The refusal decision explains that it was up to the  Crown  Prosecution
    Service to make application for the claimant to remain in  the  UK  for
    the purpose of the proposed prosecution, but no  such  application  was
    made and thus the need for discretionary leave to  remain  outside  the
    Rules no longer applies.

27. In his submissions Mr Collins accepted that neither  the  claimant  nor
    any of her family members can meet the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules for leave to remain. That is a highly relevant factor  that  must
    be taken into account in any Article 8 assessment. There is a route for
    leave  to  remain,  but  they  have  not  been  able  to   meet   those
    requirements. Any Article 8 assessment has to be seen through the prism
    of the Immigration Rules, which form the Secretary of State's  response
    to private and family life rights under the ECHR.

28. Before considering Article 8 family and private life outside the Rules,
    I have to consider whether the private and family life circumstances of
    the  claimant  and  her  family   members   are   so   compelling   and
    insufficiently recognised in the Rules so as to render the decision  of
    the  Secretary  of  State  unjustifiably  harsh  so  as   to   require,
    exceptionally, the appeal to be allowed outside the Rules on the  basis
    of Article 8 ECHR. In that  regard,  I  have  taken  into  account  the
    principles set out in both SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and  Singh  v
    SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74. Whilst the Court of Appeal has held that there
    is no threshold or intermediary requirement  of  arguability  before  a
    decision maker moves to consider  the  second  stage  of  consideration
    outside the Rules on the basis of Article 8 ECHR, whether  that  second
    stage is required will depend on  whether  all  the  issues  have  been
    adequately addressed under the Rules. In other words, there is no  need
    to conduct a full separate examination of Article 8 outside  the  Rules
    where in the circumstances of a particular case, all issues  have  been
    addressed in the consideration under the Rules.

29. Leave to remain outside the Rules is not reserved to exceptional cases,
    but the Rules provide significant evidence about  the  relevant  public
    interest considerations, which should  be  brought  into  account  when
    striking the proper balance of interests under Article 8. Although  the
    claimant could not get to the  stage  of  consideration  of  EX1  under
    Appendix FM, the  proportionality  test  set  out  therein  is  one  of
    insurmountable obstacles, defined in EX2 as very significant  obstacles
    to continuing family life outside the UK which cannot  be  overcome  or
    which would entail very  serious  hardship  for  the  claimant  or  her
    partner. On the evidence in this case there is nothing  to  demonstrate
    that the difficulties  they  would  face  on  returning  to  Ghana  are
    insurmountable or otherwise meet the requirements under Appendix FM. In
    the circumstances, the claimant could not meet the Rules, even  if  she
    were not subject to the suitability requirements. Neither the Rules nor
    Article 8 guarantee the same standard of life or education  as  in  the
    UK. The family is not entitled to remain in the UK  just  because  they
    have no accommodation or employment lined up for them in Ghana. Article
    8 is not a shortcut to compliance with the Rules and does not represent
    a lower standard for those who fail to meet the  Rules.  Further,  they
    must be taken to have had no legitimate expectation to  remain  in  the
    UK, except in accordance with Immigration Rules, and that  they  would,
    eventually, have to return to continue their private and family life in
    Ghana.

30. Similarly, although both the claimant and her partner cannot reach  the
    very significant obstacles test under paragraph 276ADE,  again  because
    of the suitability requirements, it is relevant to note  that  even  if
    that stage could be reached they have failed to demonstrate that either
    they have lost all ties to Ghana, the older test applied in the refusal
    decision, or that there are very significant obstacles  to  integration
    in Ghana, taking into account their life there before coming to the UK.
    Mr Collins conceded this at the hearing before me.

31. As held in SS(Congo), I am required to give the  Rules  greater  weight
    than merely  as  a  starting  point  for  consideration  of  Article  8
    proportionality. Although a test of exceptionality does  not  apply  in
    every case, the Court of Appeal stated at �33 "..it is accurate to stay
    that the  general  position  outside  the  sorts  of  special  contexts
    referred to above is that compelling circumstances  would  need  to  be
    identified to support a claim for a grant of LTR outside the new  Rules
    in Appendix FM." The Court of Appeal went on to  state  that  whilst  a
    requirement of very compelling circumstances or exceptionality is not a
    requirement,  a   requirement   of   compelling   circumstances   gives
    appropriate weight to the  focused  consideration  of  public  interest
    factors under Appendix FM.

32. On the facts of this case, notwithstanding  the  circumstances  of  the
    children,  I  am  not  satisfied  that   there   are   any   compelling
    circumstances in this case to  justify  consideration  of  family  life
    outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of Article 8 ECHR.

33. However, even if I went on to consider Article 8 outside the Rules,  in
    the Razgar proportionality balancing exercise between on the  one  hand
    the rights of the claimant and her family members and on the other  the
    legitimate and necessary aim of protecting the economic  well-being  of
    the UK through immigration control I would be required to take  account
    of section 117B of the 2002 Act. In particular I have to  take  account
    of the following factors: that immigration control  is  in  the  public
    interest; that it is in the public interest that persons  who  seek  to
    remain in the UK are financially independent, which  the  claimant  and
    her family are not; and that little  weight  should  be  given  to  any
    private life developed in the UK whilst the immigration status  of  the
    claimant and her family members was entirely precarious. I  would  also
    have to add to the weight of public interest factors  balanced  against
    the rights of the claimant and her family members that both she and her
    husband have engaged in fraudulent criminal  conduct  such  that  their
    presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good. Whilst  section
    117B(6) provides that the public interest does not require the  removal
    of  a  person  where  there  is  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
    relationship with a qualifying child, and that Chelsea is a  qualifying
    child because she has lived in the UK for  a  continuous  period  of  7
    years or more, and it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to
    leave the UK. That is the same test as  under  276ADE.  In  AM  (S117B)
    Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260  (IAC),  the  Upper  Tribunal  held  that  this
    question must be posed and answered in the proper context of whether it
    was reasonable to expect the child  to  follow  its  parents  to  their
    country of origin, citing EV (Philippines), and it is  not  a  question
    that needs to be posed and answered in relation to each child more than
    once. I have already addressed this  question  and  concluded  that  it
    would be reasonable to  expect  the  children,  including  Chelsea,  to
    accompany their parents to Ghana, where those parents have no right  to
    remain in the UK and are to be removed.

34. There are, therefore, very significant public  interest  considerations
    weighing in the balance against the desires of  the  claimant  and  her
    family to remain in the UK, where they have been now for some 10  years
    or so.

35. To be added to the above, there are the considerations  from  the  best
    interest of the children cases set out above. None of the family  is  a
    British citizen and none have any right to remain or be educated in  or
    financially supported by the UK. None  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules. There would be a very significant cost to the public
    purse in allowing this family to remain in the UK. The conduct  of  the
    parents should not be visited as a  punishment  on  the  children,  but
    their conduct strongly tips the balance in favour  of  removal  of  the
    parents. Where the parents should be removed  the  starting  point  for
    consideration of the children  is  that  they  should  accompany  their
    parents back to Ghana, unless there are  compelling  circumstances  why
    any one or more of those children should  not  be  removed  along  with
    their parents. I have given full account to their integration into life
    in the UK and that three of the four are in full-time education in  the
    UK. I take account of the disruption there will  be  at  being  removed
    from schooling and returning or going to Ghana where  they  have  never
    lived. On the other hand education in English is available for them  in
    Ghana, where they have a wide family network  from  both  maternal  and
    paternal families, compared with the  UK  where  they  have  no  family
    members. I also bear in  mind  the  education  and  qualifications  the
    parents have both obtained whilst studying in the UK, which will  stand
    them in good stead on returning to Ghana. I have  in  particular  given
    careful  consideration  to  the  factors  set  out   at   �35   of   EV
    (Philippines), including the length of time they have been in  the  UK,
    particularly Chelsea; the stage of education reached by Chelsea, now in
    secondary school; their lack of familiarity with Ghana; and  that  they
    are not going to  have  linguistic,  medical  or  other  particular  or
    special difficulties in adapting to life in Ghana. Weighing  all  these
    matters, together with all those urged  upon  me  in  Mr  Collins  oral
    submissions, I find that if an Article 8 ECHR  assessment  were  to  be
    carried out outside the Rules, the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    would be found to be entirely proportionate and not disproportionate to
    the collective or individual rights of  the  claimant  and  her  family
    members.

Conclusion and decision:

36. For the reasons set out herein, the appeal must  be  dismissed  on  all
    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. The First-tier Tribunal  did  not  make  an  order.  No
submissions were made on the issue.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
