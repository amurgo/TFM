Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Mannan, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on 28 July  1970.  He  has
      been given permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge White dismissing his appeal  against  the  respondent's
      decision to refuse his human rights claim.

   2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom in September 2003 with  leave
      to enter as a student and was subsequently granted further periods  of
      leave to remain as a student until 31 October 2008. His wife,  also  a
      Nigerian national, joined him in the UK as his dependant on 15 January
      2008. Their first child, Williams, was born here on  4  October  2008.
      Following  an  unsuccessful  application  for  leave  to  remain,  the
      appellant was granted leave to remain as a student  until  31  October
      2009  with  his  wife  and  child  as  his  dependants.  He  made   an
      unsuccessful application for further leave to remain as a student  but
      then successfully applied for, and was granted, Tier 1 leave until  21
      September 2012. A second child, Michelle, was born on 24 July 2010.


   3. On 20 September 2012 the appellant applied, together with his wife and
      children, for leave to remain outside the immigration rules,  but  his
      application was rejected on 25 October 2012. Two further  applications
      were refused on 30 August 2013 and 5 December 2013, by  which  time  a
      third child, Nicole, had been born on 5 September 2013. The respondent
      agreed to reconsider the appellant's application following the  threat
      of judicial review, but refused it again on 15 December 2015.


   4. In refusing that  application,  the  respondent  considered  that  the
      appellant did not meet the eligibility requirements  in  paragraph  R-
      LTRP.1.1(d) of Appendix FM as his partner was not British and was  not
      settled in the UK.  It  was  considered  that  he  did  not  meet  the
      eligibility requirements as a parent for the purposes of paragraph  R-
      LTRPT.1.1(d) since, whilst his eldest child had been living in the  UK
      for more than 7 years, it was not unreasonable to expect the  children
      to return with him  to  Nigeria  as  a  family  unit.  The  respondent
      considered, in  addition,  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
      criteria in paragraph 276ADE(1) on the basis of private life and  that
      there were no exceptional circumstances justifying a  grant  of  leave
      outside the immigration rules.

   5. The appellant appealed against that decision. His appeal was heard  by
      First-tier Tribunal Judge White on 19 April 2017, by  which  time  the
      children were aged 8�, 6 � and 3�. The  judge  recorded  that  it  was
      accepted by the  appellant's  representative  that  the  eldest  child
      Williams had not been in the UK  for  7  years  at  the  date  of  the
      application and the appeal was therefore focussed on Article 8 outside
      the  immigration  rules  and  whether  there   were   any   compelling
      circumstances justifying a grant  of  leave  outside  the  immigration
      rules. The judge found that it  was  in  the  best  interests  of  the
      children to stay together and with their parents. In the case  of  the
      younger two, he considered that that could be in any country,  but  in
      the case of the eldest Williams he found that if  his  best  interests
      were in remaining in  the  UK,  it  was  only  marginally.  The  judge
      concluded, however, that it was reasonable to expect Williams to leave
      the UK with the rest of his family and he found that the  respondent's
      decision to remove the family to Nigeria was therefore  proportionate.
      He accordingly dismissed the appeal on human rights grounds.

   6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by the appellant
      on the grounds that the judge had failed to  distinguish  between  the
      adults and the children, that there had been no separate consideration
      of the children under  section  117B(1)  -  (5)  of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and that there had been  an  error  in
      the consideration of section 117B(6).


   7. Permission was initially refused in the First-tier Tribunal,  but  was
      subsequently granted by the Upper Tribunal on the basis that the judge
      had arguably failed to attach significant  weight  to  the  qualifying
      child's length of residence in determining reasonableness pursuant  to
      the guidance in MA (Pakistan) & Ors, R (on the application of) v Upper
      Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) & Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 705.

Appeal Hearing

   8. At the hearing both parties made submissions.

   9. Mr Mannan's submission was that the judge had given inadequate  weight
      to factors which should have been accorded significant weight,  namely
      the length of time the eldest child Williams had been in  the  UK  and
      his integration into the UK in terms of language  and  education.  The
      judge had erred by placing too much weight on the fact that the family
      would be kept together if removed to Nigeria.


  10. Ms Pal submitted that the judge's approach was correct, that  he  took
      account of all relevant matters and that the matter of weight was  for
      him to decide.


Consideration and findings

  11. I find no error of law in the judge's decision.  The  decision  is  in
      fact a detailed and careful one which addresses all relevant  matters,
      correctly applies relevant caselaw and provides  detailed  and  cogent
      reasoning. There is no merit in the suggestion that the judge erred by
      failing to follow the approach in MA. On  the  contrary,  the  judge's
      decision was entirely consistent with the approach  set  out  in  that
      case. The judge commenced, as he was supposed to  do,  by  considering
      the best interests of the children.  In  so  doing  he  had  full  and
      careful regard to the circumstances of all three  children,  including
      their education and level of integration into the UK and the fact that
      the eldest child had been in  the  UK  for  more  than  7  years.  His
      conclusion, set out at [19],  was  that  the  best  interests  of  the
      children were to remain with their parents as a family unit  and  that
      that could be in any country in the case of the youngest two.  In  the
      case of  the  eldest  child  he  concluded  that  his  best  interests
      marginally lay in remaining in the UK with his  family.  He  explained
      why that was so and was fully and properly entitled to conclude as  he
      did.

  12. The grounds of challenge and Mr Mannan's submissions are  that,  given
      the eldest child's  length  of  residence  in  the  UK  and  level  of
      integration, and given the finding as to his best  interests,  it  was
      then for the respondent to demonstrate exceptional reasons as  to  why
      he should not be removed from the UK, which she had not  done.  It  is
      suggested that that was the correct approach as set out in MA. However
      it seems to me that the judge followed what was the  correct  approach
      in MA, as he set out at [9], namely to consider the best interests  of
      the children, in particular  the  eldest  child,  as  a  significantly
      weighty matter but to then go on and consider  all  other  matters  in
      assessing  reasonableness,  including  the  relevant  public  interest
      considerations. That is precisely what the judge did at [20] and [21].
      He was perfectly entitled to consider the immigration history  of  the
      appellant and his wife as part of the reasonableness assessment and to
      conclude that it was reasonable to expect the eldest  child  to  leave
      the UK with his parents and return to Nigeria as a family unit. Such a
      conclusion was supported by detailed  and  cogent  reasoning  and  was
      entirely open to the judge on the evidence before him. The  judge  was
      therefore entitled to conclude that section 117B(6) did not assist the
      appellant and, having again considered the family's  circumstances  in
      the UK and in Nigeria, to conclude that the respondent's decision  was
      a proportionate one and did not breach the appellant's Article 8 human
      rights.

  13. Accordingly the judge was entitled to dismiss the appeal on the  basis
      that he did. I find no errors of law in his decision, which I uphold.

DECISION

  14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      an error on a point of law. I do  not  set  aside  the  decision.  The
      decision to dismiss the appeal stands.
