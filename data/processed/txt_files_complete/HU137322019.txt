Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Ahmed, Counsel on behalf of the appellant.
For the Respondent:    Ms Pettersen, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


      1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Lodato (hereinafter referred  to  as  the
         "FtTJ") promulgated on the 5 October 2020, in which the appellant's
         appeal against the decision to refuse  her  application  for  entry
         clearance on Article grounds was dismissed.


      2. The FtTJ did not make an anonymity order  and  no  application  was
         made for such an order before the Upper Tribunal.

      3. The hearing took place on 21  May  2021,  by  means  of  Skype  for
         Business. which has been consented to and not objected  to  by  the
         parties. A face- to- face hearing was not held because it  was  not
         practicable, and both parties  agreed  that  all  issues  could  be
         determined in a remote hearing. The advocates attended remotely via
         video as did the appellant's father who was able to  see  and  hear
         the proceedings. There were  no  issues  regarding  sound,  and  no
         problematic technical problems were encountered during the  hearing
         and  I  am  satisfied  both  advocates  were  able  to  make  their
         respective cases by the chosen means.

      4. I am  grateful  to  Mr  Ahmed  and  Ms  Pettersen  for  their  oral
         submissions.

The background:

      5. The factual history is not  in  dispute  and  is  set  out  in  the
         decision of the FtTJ.

      6. I shall summarise the background to this appeal. The appellant is a
         national of Sri Lanka born in 1997. The appellant's father came  to
         the UK in November 2008 and her mother and younger sibling  entered
         the United Kingdom in  March  2009  and  made  an  application  for
         asylum. Their  application  for  asylum  was  refused  however  her
         parents and her younger sibling were granted discretionary leave to
         remain in the UK.

      7. The appellant and  the  other  remaining  sibling  (born  in  2001)
         remained in Sri Lanka within the care of the  elderly  grandparents
         who had been suffering various age-related health conditions.

      8.  As  the  appellant's  parents  and  her  minor  sibling  were  not
         recognised as refugees the appellant and her other sibling did  not
         qualify for family reunion. Despite  this  the  appellant  and  her
         sibling made application to the respondent to join their parents in
         the UK. The applications are supported by the parents' local MP  in
         the UK. Each application was refused as  the  respondent  took  the
         view that there was nothing exceptional under article 8 of the ECHR
         and the appellant's parents did not have settled status to  sponsor
         the appellant and her sibling to join them in the UK.

      9. The appellant's father obtained indefinite leave to remain  in  the
         UK and following this the appellant and her  sibling  on  18  April
         2019 made an application to join their parents in the  UK,  relying
         on Paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules. The appellant's  sibling
         was under the age of 18 therefore his application  was  granted  as
         the respondent was satisfied that he met all  the  requirements  of
         the relevant Rule. The appellant's sibling is now in the UK.

     10. The appellant's application was refused in a decision taken  on  31
         July 2019.

     11. The decision letter begins with a consideration of Paragraph 297 of
         the Immigration Rules. The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (hereinafter
         referred to as the "ECO") noted that  while  both  the  appellant's
         parents were  present  and  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the
         appellant could not meet paragraph 297 (ii)  which  states  that  a
         person seeking indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom as  the
         child of a parent is under the age of 18. As the appellant was over
         the age of 18 at the time of the application, it was refused.

     12. The ECO considered the case outside of the rules but concluded that
         on the information provided he was not  satisfied  that  a  refusal
         would lead to  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for  either  the
         appellant or her family. In doing so, it was stated  that  the  ECO
         had  considered  the  relevant  factors   both   individually   and
         cumulatively and a key consideration was whether a refusal would be
         justified  by  the  public  interest  which  included   maintaining
         effective immigration control. The ECO took into account  that  her
         parents moved to the UK in 2009 and that the appellant was able  to
         demonstrate she could  maintain  a  relationship  with  her  family
         members throughout that time. Thus, he concluded as  an  adult  her
         desire to live in the UK rather than Sri Lanka did not represent  a
         relevant factor. As article 8 does not oblige the UK to permit  all
         other family  members  to  relocate,  he  was  satisfied  that  the
         decision was proportionate under article 8 (2) of the ECHR.

The decision of the FtTJ:

     13. The appellant appealed that decision, and it came before the FtT on
         24 September 2020 before FtTJ Lodato. In a decision promulgated  on
         5 October 2020 the appellant's appeal was dismissed.  At  paragraph
         [2] the FtTJ set out the issues to be determined; it  was  accepted
         that the application fell outside of the Immigration Rules and  the
         primary issues to be resolved were whether family life was  engaged
         and if so, whether  the  interference  was  disproportionate  under
         article 8 of the ECHR.  The  FtTJ  set  out  the  applicable  legal
         framework at paragraphs [3]-[13].

     14. The FtTJ heard oral evidence from the appellant's father  and  also
         from her brother which the judge summarised at paragraphs [18]-[19]
         of his decision. The judge also was provided with written  evidence
         which he summarised  at  [14]  and  [17  -  23]  which  included  a
         statement from the appellant which described the distress  she  had
         suffered as a result of the decision (at  [17])  and  also  letters
         from the younger siblings (at [20]).  Further  supporting  evidence
         from medical professionals was assessed at [21] - [22] alongside  a
         series of money transfers from 2012 - 2020 and  supportive  letters
         from their local MP.

     15. Having summarised the arguments advanced by each  of  the  parties,
         the FtTJ set out his analysis and assessment at [29] - [41].

     16. He began his analysis by undertaking  an  assessment  of  the  best
         interests of the relevant children affected by the decision and  in
         this context took into account the letters by the children in which
         they described their sadness at not sharing  the  family  household
         with  their  elder  sister,  the  appellant.  However,  the   judge
         concluded that "there was very little evidence touching upon  their
         best interests. It is unsurprising that they would like to live  in
         the same home as their older sister. I  have  seen  nothing  beyond
         expressions of sadness that would lead  me  to  conclude  that  the
         development, progress or well-being the children would be adversely
         affected by the respondent's decision." The judge took into account
         that the appellant had not lived  in  the  same  household  as  her
         immediate family since 2009 that he found  the  appellant  had  not
         proved on the balance of probabilities that the best  interests  of
         children would be adversely impacted by the  "continuation  of  the
         long-standing situation of her living in Sri Lanka.".

     17. The FtTJ then turned to  the  issue  of  whether  family  life  was
         engaged. Having in mind the legal guidance which  he  had  set  out
         earlier in his decision, he observed that it was "too simplistic to
         find that family life is not engaged simply because  the  appellant
         is now an adult." He directed himself that "it is worth bearing  in
         mind that many of the authorities which have emphasise  that  adult
         hood is not necessarily a decisive factor, relate  to  cases  where
         the adult child  lived  or  recently  lived,  in  the  family  home
         together with the immediate family. This is not such a case as  the
         appellant has not lived in the  same  household  as  her  immediate
         family since 2009, when her parents left  Sri  Lanka  for  the  UK.
         "Notwithstanding that feature, the judge  was  satisfied  that  the
         appellant's article 8 rights were engaged and that there  had  been
         interference of such gravity as to potentially  engage  article  8.
         The judge also noted that the decision had resulted in the  further
         "splintering of the appellant's immediate family in Sri Lanka. Both
         siblings have described how they relied upon each other  to  ensure
         the emotional suffering of being separated from their  parents  and
         siblings in 2009." Accordingly, the judge also  took  into  account
         the further separation between the appellant  and  her  brother  as
         further interference of family life sufficient to engage article 8.
         Thus, he found that this dimension of the appellant's  family  life
         went "well beyond mere ties of love and affection."


     18. At [32] the judge addressed an argument advanced on behalf  of  the
         appellant that it must be inferred that paragraph  297  would  have
         been satisfied were it not for her age. The FtTJ concluded that the
         respondent had not directed herself to the wrong provisions nor was
         paragraph 297 misapplied in the appellant's case. The appellant was
         over 18 years old at the time the decision was made  and  therefore
         could not meet the requirements of  the  gateway  to  obtain  entry
         clearance. He rejected the  argument  advanced  on  behalf  of  the
         appellant that it must be inferred that the rule  would  have  been
         satisfied if it were not for her age taking into account  that  "an
         additional factor that must be considered is whether the  appellant
         lives an independent  life."  The  judge  found  that  it  did  not
         necessarily  follow  that  because  the  appellant's  brother   was
         considered to be the sole responsibility of their parents the  same
         conclusion will be reached for  the  appellant  who  was  an  adult
         sibling who attended university and lived independent of her family
         during term time. Thus, the judge was satisfied that  the  decision
         when applying paragraph 297 was in accordance with the law.

     19. At paragraphs [33] - [41], the FtTJ undertook  the  proportionality
         balance, identifying the factors in favour  of  the  appellant  and
         those against the appellant thus undertaking  the  "balance  sheet"
         approach. In doing so, the judge took into account the section 117B
         public interest considerations (at [34]).

     20. The judge took into account in support of the respondent's decision
         that the appellant's parents made a conscious decision to establish
         family life in the UK and although an asylum claim was  made  after
         the initial arrival, this had failed. He  also  took  into  account
         that the grant of indefinite leave to remain  was  not  based  upon
         international protection and based on the sponsor's  evidence  that
         he frequently travelled to Sri  Lanka  there  was  no  evidence  to
         indicate that the family could not live together with the appellant
         there. He found that the appellant's parents had made a  choice  to
         live in the UK in circumstances when they could have chosen to live
         in Sri Lanka, and he found that to be a  factor  "weighing  against
         the appellant in conducting the balancing exercise" (at [35]).

     21. At [36] is a further factor weighing against the appellant was that
         she was to some degree leading an independent life. The judge  took
         into account that she was a student at  university  a  considerable
         distance  from  her  grandparents'   home   and   that   in   those
         circumstances "it would be difficult to conclude that the appellant
         is wholly dependent or, as the appellant's counsel argued, the sole
         responsibility of the parents. For much of the year, the  appellant
         would appear to live independently as an adult." The judge did  not
         accept that all key life decisions were taken on her behalf by  her
         parents as this was "difficult to reconcile  with  her  life  as  a
         university student living some distance from  her  grandparents  to
         whom the sponsor entrusted to her care when she was a  child."  The
         judge also found that it was "a powerful factor" that the appellant
         was now an adult and had not lived in the  same  household  as  her
         parents for 11 years.

     22.  The  judge  did  however  take  into  account  that  she  had  not
         established own family unit and that she was "only just  an  adult"
         (at [37]). At [38] the FtTJ took into  account  in  favour  of  the
         appellant the nature of her relationship with her brother. He  took
         into account that she adopted something of a "mother figure" to her
         younger brother after the rest of the family left the UK  and  that
         this  had  had  a  "profoundly  distressing  impact"  both  in  the
         appellant and the younger brother. He also took  into  account  the
         medical  evidence  relating  to  the  appellant  which   had   been
         exacerbated by the departure of her brother. At [39]  he  undertook
         an  analysis  of  the  evidence   relating   to   the   appellant's
         grandparents which he accepted demonstrated that they  become  less
         equipped over time to provide the kind of emotional  and  practical
         support that would be given by her family and again that this was a
         factor in the appellant's favour.

     23. At [40] the FtTJ considered the  impact  of  continuing  separation
         upon other members of the family in accordance with  the  case  law
         taking into account the appellant's father, her brother and  mother
         and also the other minor children.

     24. At [41] the FtTJ set out his conclusion. He stated that this was  a
         case where it would be "difficult not to be sympathetic towards the
         appellant and her immediate family. They all fervently wish to live
         together in the same household in the same country."  However,  the
         judge  stated  that  he  must  "balance  whether  the  respondent's
         decision is proportionate in the circumstances. There  are  aspects
         of the case weighing  for  and  against  the  decision,  but  I  am
         satisfied that the factors weighing for outweigh those against. The
         appellant  is  now  an  adult  enjoying  some  independence  as   a
         university student. She has not lived in the same household as  her
         immediate family for many years, and it is clear that a choice  was
         made by her parents to live in the UK in full knowledge that it may
         mean being separated from her. I find the most powerful  factor  in
         the appellant's favourite is the  disruption  to  her  relationship
         with  her  brother  which   inevitably   morphed   into   something
         approaching a parental relationship while they  lived  together  in
         Sri Lanka. However, on balance I conclude that the factors weighing
         against the appellant outweigh those in her  favour."  Accordingly,
         the judge found that there were no unjustifiably harsh consequences
         as a result of the decision and the appeal was dismissed.

     25. Permission to appeal was issued on the 21 October 2020  and  on  24
         February 2021, permission to appeal was granted by FtTJ Grant.

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal:

     26. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic  the  Upper  Tribunal  issued
         directions indicating that it was provisionally of  the  view  that
         the error of law issue could be determined without a face- to- face
         hearing and directions were given for  a  remote  hearing  to  take
         place and that this could take place via Skype. Both  parties  have
         indicated that they were content for the hearing to proceed by this
         method. Therefore, the Tribunal listed the hearing to  enable  oral
         submissions to be given by each of the parties with the  assistance
         of their advocates.

     27. Mr Ahmed on behalf of the appellant relied upon the written grounds
         of appeal.

     28. Mr Ahmed submitted that  the  FtTJ  accepted  that  article  8  was
         engaged and appeared to accept that  the  appellant's  family  life
         went beyond mere ties of affection. Thus, it was submitted that the
         appellant satisfied the high threshold  set  out  in  the  case  of
         Kugathas. Having made such a finding, he submitted on behalf of the
         appellant that the judge failed to properly give sufficient  weight
         to this when carrying out the balancing exercise  under  article  8
         and that this failure amounted to material error.

     29. Paragraph 6 of the grounds state that it was reasonable  to  submit
         and infer that Rule 297 would have been satisfied were it  not  for
         her age.  In  his  oral  submissions  Mr  Ahmed  stated  that  this
         submission was made because  as  soon  as  the  appellant's  father
         obtained indefinite leave to remain in the UK the appellant and her
         sibling on 18 April 2019 made an application to join their  parents
         in the UK relying on that Immigration Rule. The appellant's sibling
         was under the age of 18  and  thus  the  application  was  granted.
         However, the appellant's application was refused  because  she  was
         over the age of 18. Based on those facts,  it  was  submitted  that
         this was a significant material factor to take  into  account  when
         conducting the article 8 proportionality assessment.  At  [32]  the
         judge did not accept the submission and failed to give  any  cogent
         reasons for doing so.

     30. The grounds further assert that the judge gave too much  weight  to
         the  fact  that  the  appellant  attended  university   and   lived
         independently of her family during term. In this context  Mr  Ahmed
         submitted that judge failed  to  take  into  account  the  case  of
         Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy)  Nepal  [2012]  UKUT
         160. He  submitted  that  despite  the  appellant  living  away  at
         university it did not mean that less weight should be attached when
         carrying out the proportionality assessment.

     31.  It  is  further  submitted  that  the  judge  failed  to  properly
         consider/apply the proportionality test and it  is  not  clear  how
         much weight (if any) the FtTJ attached to the factors in favour  of
         the appellant.

     32. At paragraph 10 of the grounds, it  is  submitted  that  the  judge
         attached more weight to  the  factors  against  the  appellant  and
         therefore erred in the proportionality balancing exercise.

     33. The grounds cite the decision in Sezen v Netherlands (2006) EHRR 30
         where the court stated at [49] "the court has previously held  that
         domestic measures which prevent family members from living together
         constitute an interference with the right protected by article 8 of
         the convention and that split up a family is an interference  of  a
         very serious order." No further part of that decision was cited  in
         the oral submissions.

     34. It is submitted that the judge failed to properly consider  whether
         it would be proportionate to the appellant to remain in  Sri  Lanka
         and be separated from her immediate family  when  family  life  was
         engaged, and it was accepted  that  the  case  satisfies  the  high
         threshold set out in Kugathas.  He therefore invited  the  tribunal
         to find a material error of law and set aside the decision.

     35. Ms Pettersen relied upon the Rule 24 response filed  on  behalf  of
         the respondent dated 17  May  2021.   The  respondent  opposes  the
         appellant's appeal.  In summary, the respondent submitted that  the
         judge of the First-tier Tribunal directed himself appropriately.

     36. The respondent further submits that the grounds  of  appeal  are  a
         disagreement about the weight given by the FTT Judge to the factors
         in carrying out  the  proportionality  balancing  exercise.  It  is
         asserted that the Judge gave to much weight  to  the  factors  that
         went against the appellant. However, the Judge thoroughly  reviewed
         all the factors, both for and against the appellant  in  coming  to
         the conclusion that the decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance  was
         proportionate. Ms Pettersen therefore invited the court  to  uphold
         the decision.

     37. At the conclusion of the hearing, I reserved my  decision  which  I
         now give.



Discussion:

     38. I have given careful consideration to the grounds of  challenge  in
         the context of the decision of the FtTJ and the evidence before the
         tribunal.

     39. The grounds seek to challenge  the  assessment  of  proportionality
         carried out by the FtTJ by reference to particular factors relevant
         to the balancing exercise.

     40. Mr Ahmed submitted by reference to paragraphs [24] and [32] of  the
         decision that the judge failed to take into account  a  significant
         material factor in the proportionality balance and that had it  not
         been for the appellant's age,  paragraph  297  of  the  Immigration
         Rules would have been satisfied.

     41. Mr Ahmed submitted that as soon as the appellant's father  obtained
         indefinite leave to remain then the appellant and her sibling  made
         an application to join their parents in the UK relying on paragraph
         297. As the appellant's sibling was under 18  the  application  was
         granted as the  respondent  was  satisfied  that  he  met  all  the
         requirements. The appellant's application was refused  because  she
         was over 18. He submitted that this was an argument advanced before
         the judge and that he had failed to give  cogent  reasons  for  not
         taking that into account.

     42. Having considered that submission, I am satisfied there is no merit
         to it. The judge plainly engaged with this submission. At paragraph
         [24] the FtTJ recorded the submission in full and at [32] addressed
         the submission by giving cogent and sustainable reasons why such  a
         submission made that "it must be inferred that rule 297 would  have
         been satisfied were it not for her age" did not apply.

     43. As the FtTJ correctly identified, the framework for decision-making
         was provided by the Immigration Rules and as set out, there was  no
         suggestion that the respondent  wrongly  directed  herself  to  the
         substance of Paragraph 297. The appellant was over 18 years of  age
         and therefore was an adult at the time the decision  was  made  and
         therefore could not meet the requirements of the gateway to  obtain
         entry clearance. This argument was akin to a "near miss"  argument.
         As Ms Pettersen submitted the appellant's age was 21  �  years  and
         thus could not properly be characterised  as  a  "near  miss"  when
         looking at her age. As the  decision  in  Patel  confirms  at  [56[
         whilst  the  "context  of  the  Rules  may  be  relevant   to   the
         consideration,  proportionality  this  cannot  be  equated  with  a
         formalised "near miss" or "sliding scale approach".

     44. A related point relied upon by Mr Ahmed was that the judge did  not
         address the inconsistency between the decision made in relation  to
         the appellant's brother (who was under 18) and  the  appellant  and
         that but for her age she would have met the relevant  rule.  Again,
         this submission was addressed by the FtTJ at [32]  and  within  the
         proportionality balance itself, the judge was plainly aware of  the
         circumstances of the applicant and considered it in the context  of
         the family history. The judge was entitled  to  take  into  account
         when addressing the circumstances of the appellant and her  brother
         that on  the  facts  as  he  found  them  to  be,  the  appellant's
         circumstances could be distinguished  from  those  of  her  younger
         sibling and that she had been leading an independent life.

     45. The judge therefore addressed the point made by Mr Ahmed  that  the
         appellant's younger brother satisfied the rule because he was under
         18 and because the respondent was satisfied that the parents in the
         UK had sole responsibility for him, but the judge found that it did
         not necessarily follow that because  the  appellant's  brother  was
         considered to be the sole responsibility of his  parents  that  the
         same conclusion could be reached in relation to the  appellant.  On
         the factual findings the judge  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
         appellant's circumstances differed, not only by reason of  her  age
         but also because she was to some degree leading an independent life
         (at [36]). The judge found that the appellant was at  university  a
         considerable geographical distance from her grandparents' home  and
         therefore it was not the case as  Mr  Ahmed  had  argued  that  the
         appellant was wholly dependent or the sole  responsibility  of  her
         parents. The judge  also  rejected  the  submission  that  all  key
         decisions were taken on her behalf in  the  light  of  the  factual
         circumstances  where  the  appellant  was  an   adult,   living   a
         considerable distance away from her grandparents and  living  as  a
         university student and not having lived with  her  parents  for  11
         years.

     46. This leads me to the next paragraph of the grounds relied upon  set
         out at paragraph 7 where it is submitted that the  judge  gave  too
         much weight to the fact that the appellant attended university  and
         was living independently of her family during term  time.  In  this
         context Mr Ahmed referred to the decision in Ghising  although  the
         tribunal was not directed  to  any  particular  paragraph  of  that
         decision. It was submitted that despite living away  at  university
         it did not mean that less weight should be attached to this in  the
         proportionality assessment.

     47. Again, I am satisfied that there is no merit in the submission. The
         FtTJ carefully considered the circumstances of  the  appellant  and
         expressly her age. At [37] he took into account that  she  had  not
         started or established her own family  unit  and  that  at  age  21
         �years she was only just an adult but not  withstanding  that,  the
         judge was entitled to  take  into  account  as  a  factor  weighing
         against the appellant that to  some  degree,  she  was  leading  an
         independent life for the reasons he set out at [36].

     48. The grounds at paragraph (7) and  (10)  both  refer  to  the  judge
         giving too much weight to the  fact  that  the  appellant  attended
         university and was living independently of her family  during  term
         time. It is further submitted at paragraph 10 of the judge attached
         more weight to the factors against the appellant and erred  in  the
         balancing exercise. In my judgement these submissions are  properly
         characterised as mere disagreements about the weight to be accorded
         to the evidence which is a matter for the judge and should  not  be
         characterised as an error of law (see decision in  Herrera  v  SSHD
         [2018] EWCA Civ 412 at [18]).

     49. Contrary to the grounds (at paragraph 9 and the oral submissions) a
         careful reading of the decision demonstrates that  it  is  entirely
         clear  how  the  FtTJ  undertook  the   proportionality   balancing
         exercise. When considering article 8 outside of the rules the judge
         lawfully  applied  R(Agyarko)  [2017]   UKSC   17   which   demands
         consideration of whether there are unjustifiably harsh consequences
         and a proportionality balance between the public  and  individual's
         interests.

     50. At paragraph [35] the FtTJ expressly directed himself in accordance
         with the  law  and  that  "in  deciding  whether  the  respondent's
         decision was disproportionate I must carefully balance the  factors
         weighing in favour of the decision and those weighing against." The
         judge addressed as a primary consideration the  best  interests  of
         the relevant children affected by the decision  at  paragraph  [30]
         and the finding that the appellant had not proved on the balance of
         probabilities that the best  interests  of  the  relevant  children
         would  be  adversely  impacted   by   the   continuation   of   her
         circumstances described as a "long standing situation of  a  living
         and Sri Lanka" has not been challenged in the  grounds.  The  judge
         considered proportionality in accordance with the  public  interest
         considerations set out in S117B and was not  in  error  in  placing
         weight on the fact that the appellant could not succeed  under  the
         rules in assessing proportionality; the policy of the Secretary  of
         State expressed in the rules is not to be  ignored  and  is  to  be
         granted weight in the proportionality balance.

     51. The FtTJ in addition took into account on the respondent's side  of
         the balance that the appellant's parents made a conscious  decision
         to establish family life in the UK and that the asylum claim failed
         after their initial arrival and  it  was  the  family's  choice  to
         remain and in the  light  of  the  knowledge  that  they  would  be
         separated from the appellant who had remained  in  Sri  Lanka.  The
         FtTJ was entitled to place weight on the well-established principle
         that article 8 does not provide complete freedom for  a  family  to
         choose the country in which they wish to live.

     52. Furthermore, the judge was entitled to place weight upon the factor
         that there was no evidence that the family could not live  together
         in Sri Lanka (see paragraph [35]). The FtTJ found that the family's
         grant of leave  was  not  based  on  any  international  protection
         grounds and that the sponsor's evidence was that he had  frequently
         travelled to Sri Lanka and had done so as recently as August 2019.

     53.  Whilst reliance is placed on  the  decision  of  Sezen  (as  cited
         earlier), the quotation set out in the grounds is  not  a  complete
         citation of paragraph 49 which goes on to state "having  regard  to
         its finding... That the second appellant and the children cannot be
         expected to follow the first applicant to Turkey, the effect of the
         family being split up therefore remains the same (as when a 10-year
         exclusion order remained in force) as long as the  first  applicant
         continues to be denied the right to  reside  in  the  Netherlands."
         Sezen is cited in the decision of Beouku- Betts v SSHD [2008]  UKHL
         38 as is the decision of Huang which refer to the guiding principle
         as being whether family life  can  reasonably  be  expected  to  be
         enjoyed elsewhere (Huang at  [20]).  This  was  an  issue  properly
         addressed by the judge and factored into his assessment as set  out
         at paragraph [35].

     54. In addition, the judge identified  a  number  of  factors  weighing
         against the appellant and that she was to some  degree  leading  an
         independent life as  a  student  at  a  university  a  considerable
         distance from the grandparents' home and that for much of the  year
         lived independently as an adult. The judge  was  also  entitled  to
         take into account that "it is also a powerful factor in  this  case
         that the appellant is now an adult and has not lived  in  the  same
         household as her parents for 11 years" (at [36]).

     55. At paragraphs [38  -  41]  the  FtTJ  also  addressed  the  factors
         weighing in favour of the appellant and contrary to the grounds and
         the grant of permission, properly  took  into  account  and  placed
         weight on the nature of the relationship between the appellant  and
         her brother. The judge was acutely aware of the  strength  of  that
         relationship and  the  effect  of  the  separation  caused  by  the
         decision of the respondent including that  as  reflected  upon  the
         appellant's medical health and the loneliness  that  she  described
         feeling since her brother left. The judge  took  into  account  the
         circumstances of the appellant's grandparents and  their  advancing
         years as a factor in favour of the appellant (at  paragraph  [39]),
         and properly applied the ratio of Beouku-Betts and the  impact  the
         decision would have upon the appellant and also the members of  her
         family. At [40] the judge addressed the issue by reference  to  the
         appellant's family members including the appellant's father, mother
         and brother and made reference to the  best  interest's  assessment
         that he had earlier made at [30].

     56. At [41] is the FtTJ returned to the  balancing  exercise  observing
         that there were aspects  of  the  case  weighing  for  against  the
         decision but that he was satisfied that the  factors  weighing  for
         the appellant were outweighed by those against and in reaching that
         decision he plainly accorded significant weight to  the  disruption
         of the relationship with her brother  which  he  considered  was  a
         "powerful factor". However,  on  balance  he  concluded  "that  the
         factors weighing against the appellant were outweighed those in her
         favour."

     57. This was a carefully reasoned decision by a judge who  was  plainly
         aware of the circumstances of the appellant. As he observed at [41]
         it was a case where it would be difficult  not  to  be  sympathetic
         towards the appellant and her immediate family. I consider that the
         decision reached by the  FtTJ  demonstrates  that  he  undertook  a
         lawful evaluative  assessment  of  proportionality  which  patently
         engaged  with  the  material  issues  raised.  The  assessment   of
         proportionality has not been shown to be one that was not available
         to the FtTJ  on  the  evidence  and  the  findings  are  adequately
         reasoned and are not shown to be outside the  range  of  reasonable
         findings open to the judge.

     58. I remind myself of the words of Baroness Hale in AS (Sudan) at [34]
         that an "appellate court should not rush to find such  misdirection
         simply because they might reach a different conclusion on the facts
         or express themselves differently".

     59. I am satisfied that the FtTJ addressed all the material factors  in
         the balancing exercise and reached an outcome that  was  rationally
         open to him to make. Accordingly, there is no error of law  in  the
         decision of the FtTJ.



Notice of Decision.


     60. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making
         of an error on a point of law and therefore the decision of the FtT
         shall stand.
