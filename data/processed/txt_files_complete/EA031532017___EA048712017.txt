                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS

     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge White promulgated on 22 May 2018 in which the  Judge
        dismissed the appellants appeal.




Background


     2. The appellant is a citizen of  Nigeria  born  on  1  May  1982  who
        entered the United Kingdom as  a  student.  On  21  July  2011  the
        appellant married a Portuguese citizen who  was  exercising  treaty
        rights in the  United  Kingdom  by  way  of  a  customary  marriage
        conducted by proxy in Nigeria. On  5  October  2012  the  appellant
        married the same person in a civil ceremony in the  United  Kingdom
        following which, on 4 July 2013, he was  issued  with  a  residence
        card as a family  member  of  an  EEA  national  exercising  treaty
        rights. The couple, however, separated and  on  11  July  2016  the
        marriage was dissolved.

     3. On 30 August 2016 the appellant applied for a  permanent  residence
        card as a family member who retained  the  right  of  residence  on
        divorce having completed 5 years residence in accordance  with  the
        regulations. The application was refused on 11 March  2017.  On  22
        March 2017 the respondent revoked the  appellant's  residence  card
        against which the appellant appealed to  the  First-Tier  Tribunal.
        The Judge noted that whilst  the  above  appeals  are  pending  the
        appellant made four further applications for a  residence  card  on
        the basis of a retained right  of  residence,  two  of  which  were
        rejected for procedural defects and two refused on  the  basis  the
        appellant had been  unable  to  provide  an  original  passport  ID
        document for the EEA national.

     4. The Judge  sets  out  findings  from  [8]  of  the  decision  under
        challenge in which it was found there was no  doubt  the  appellant
        was a family member of the EEA national for  the  purposes  of  the
        regulations [9].

     5. The Judge records at [14] "the  real  issue  in  these  appeals  is
        whether Ms Dionisio was exercising treaty rights up to and  at  the
        date of divorce. If she was not exercising  treaty  rights  over  a
        continuous period prior to the divorce the appellant would not have
        been residing continuously in accordance with the 2006 Regulations,
        which he needs to have done for a total of 5 years. If she was  not
        exercising treaty rights at the date of the divorce he  would  have
        no right capable of being retained at that point, and nothing  that
        happened before or afterwards could remedy that."

     6. The Judge considered the evidence provided of  the  EEA  national's
        work and self-employment at [15 - 17] before concluding  at  [18  -
        21]:

             "18.     It is not necessary, to be regarded as  a  worker  or
                  self-employed person, to  earn  an  amount  equal  to  the
                  minimum wage,  or  an  amount  sufficient  for  one's  own
                  maintenance.  It  is  necessary  to  show  involvement  in
                  genuine  and  effective  economic  activity,  rather  than
                  something which  generates  what  might  be  described  as
                  pocket money. I have no doubt that Ms  [D]'s  earnings  in
                  2013/14 were a result of genuine economic activity. It  is
                  certainly arguable that her earnings in the  two  previous
                  years should also be so classed. It  is  less  clear  that
                  this is true of 2014/15, when the earnings  evidenced  are
                  less than �3000 for the year - it  is  possible  that  she
                  also did some work for New Dawn,  given  that  she  worked
                  extensively for them the year before and still did a  very
                  small amount in the period after, but that is supposition.
                  I have no evidence for it. When I come to the period  from
                  6 April 2015 the evidence indicates that she was  employed
                  for about 4 months, earning �2900, which would seem to  be
                  genuine  economic  activity.  She  then  turned  to  self-
                  employment from the end of July,  with  the  income  noted
                  above. I note what the appellant said about seeing clients
                  2 to 3 times a week, but the evidence of  the  figures  is
                  that she was earning a  tiny  amount,  significantly  less
                  than the income support level. I  am  not  persuaded  that
                  this can be classed as genuine economic activity.

             19.  I am accordingly satisfied that Ms Dionisio was no longer
                  a worker after about July 2015 but I am not satisfied that
                  she could be described as  self-employed  thereafter.  She
                  was not, therefore, a qualified person during  the  period
                  of roughly a year up to and including the  divorce.  I  am
                  also not satisfied that it has been shown that she  was  a
                  qualified person for a continuous period of 5 years  prior
                  to stopping work in July 2015, and I do not therefore find
                  that  she  had  already  acquired  a  right  of  permanent
                  residence herself. The effect  is  that  at  the  date  of
                  divorce she was not a qualified person and  the  appellant
                  had no right of residence which he could retain. Since  he
                  cannot show  the  acquisition  of  a  right  of  permanent
                  residence prior  to  that  he  was  not  entitled  to  the
                  permanent residence card for which he applied.

             20.  It further follows that the  respondent  was  correct  to
                  conclude that on divorce he ceased  to  have  a  right  to
                  reside. The conditions for  revocation  of  his  residence
                  card was therefore made out. Mr  Goldborough  referred  to
                  the respondent's guidance on revocation in  support  of  a
                  submission that such a course is not automatic, but I  can
                  see nothing in the guidance to suggest reasons why a  card
                  should not be revoked once it becomes clear that the right
                  to reside has been lost.

             21.  I therefore find  that  the  respondent  was  correct  to
                  refuse the application, and correct to revoke the existing
                  residence card, and that both appeals, under the 2006  and
                  2016 Regulations, must fail."

     7. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
        another judge of the First-Tier Tribunal on 20 August 2018.

Error of Law


     8. The appellant challenges the decision on two grounds the  first  of
        which is an assertion the Judge erred in dismissing the appeal  "on
        immigration grounds" as this is an application under  the  European
        Directive and not under domestic immigration provisions. The  Judge
        at [23] states "this appeal is dismissed on  immigration  grounds".
        This is not a decision to dismiss the appeal under the  Immigration
        Rules, as the appellant  clearly  interprets  that  statement,  but
        rather  a  generic  statement  by  the  Judge.  A  reading  of  the
        determination clearly shows the Judge was not assessing the  merits
        of the appeal by reference to the Immigration Rules  and  notes  at
        [2] that the appeal is made pursuant to  the  relevant  Immigration
        (European Economic  Area)  Regulations.  No  arguable  legal  error
        arises on this point.

     9. The second ground asserts the  assessment  of  the  EEA  national's
        position as a  qualified  person  or  entitlement  to  a  right  of
        permanent residence at the date of divorce is flawed;  arguing  the
        Judge posed his own question rather than the current one  which  is
        whether based upon the  evidence  provided  the  EEA  national,  Ms
        Dionisio, was a qualified person at the date of divorce and whether
        she had acquired a right of permanent  residence  at  the  date  of
        divorce. The appellant challenges the Judges finding that  the  EEA
        national was not a qualified person  at  the  date  of  divorce  by
        reason of non-genuine economic activity when  the  evidence  showed
        the EEA national was self-employed on  the  basis  of  tax  returns
        dated August 2016 which showed a declared turnover was  �2460  i.e.
        profit of �45 a week.  The  appellant's  case  is  this  shows  the
        business was failing but did not show that  the  economic  activity
        was marginal nor non-genuine nor just providing pocket  money.  The
        appellant asserts the EEA national had also  acquired  a  right  of
        permanent residence as she had been residing in the United  Kingdom
        since 25 April 2008 and had worked both on an  employed  and  self-
        employed basis. Tax returns have been provided from 2010 showing an
        acquisition of a right to permanently reside at  the  time  of  the
        divorce, supporting the appellant's contention that has a  retained
        a right of residence at the date of divorce  and  that  the  appeal
        should have been allowed.

    10. Mr Goldborough was asked to confirm the relevant 5-year  period  in
        this appeal which he claimed was from 5 October 2012  to  issue  in
        February 2016. He argued that the evidence showed that EEA national
        was economically active during the relevant  period  and  that  the
        Judge misunderstood the evidence, making a material error of law.

    11. It is settled law that for a person to satisfy the definition of  a
        'worker' in the Regulations there is a  requirement  for  the  work
        being  undertaken  to  be  "genuine  and  effective"  rather   than
        "marginal  or  ancillary"  which  is  a  question  of  fact  to  be
        determined in each case. The  relationship  between  the  level  of
        income and work undertaken  can  be  assessed  by  establishing  an
        economic  measurement  of  effectiveness  although  this  need  not
        demonstrate a person is self-sufficient or any relationship to  the
        level of the minimum or living wage. It is important  also  with  a
        person who is self-employed that in addition to periods  of  actual
        work  and  remuneration  there  is  a  requirement   to   undertake
        administrative,  marketing   and   related   business   development
        activities all  of  which,  if  evidenced,  should  be  taken  into
        account.

    12. It is not made out on the evidence made available to the First-Tier
        Tribunal that any claim was made in relation to  the  EEA  national
        other than that of direct economic activity.

    13. The Judge considered the period of the tax years 2015/16 at  [17  -
        19] of the decision under challenge. The period 2014/15 appears  on
        the evidence to be the last tax year during which the EEA  national
        was employed as a worker. From April 2015  to  the  period  of  the
        divorce the EEA national was employed for  a  period  of  4  months
        only, which is not disputed.

    14. The difficulty recognised by the Judge is that from  11  July  2015
        the EEA national claims to have become self-employed but failed  to
        disclose evidence of genuine economic activity on the facts. It  is
        not made out this conclusion is arguably perverse,  irrational,  or
        contrary to the evidence, and was  arguably  within  the  range  of
        findings open to the Judge on that  evidence.  In  the  absence  of
        further evidence from the EEA national as to what she was  actually
        doing during this relevant period no arguable legal error  is  made
        out.

    15. Mr Wilding referred in his submissions to the fact there  is  still
        no evidence, even now, showing the EEA nationals  business  was  up
        and running to support the claim it was a starter business  or  one
        during a period of development when orders  and  levels  of  income
        would  understandably  be  reduced,  or  one  that  was  a   viable
        successful commercial  entity  that  was  failing.  It  is  not  an
        arguably irrational finding to conclude that the evidence  did  not
        demonstrate a business  in  its  infancy  with  a  slow  start  but
        relevant economic activity.

    16. I find no arguable error in the conclusion  reached  by  the  Judge
        which  answers  the  first  question  the  Judge  was  required  to
        consider, whether the EEA national was a qualified  person  at  the
        date of divorce, which is that she was not.

    17. It follows that if the appellant had no right under the regulations
        at the date of divorce proceedings or even decree absolute  he  had
        no right to retain as he had not established that the EEA  national
        was a qualified person for the relevant period. The status  of  the
        EEA national not establishing a right that existed at the  relevant
        period that the appellant could retain on divorce is  the  relevant
        point at which the Judge finds against the appellant.

    18. If the appellant has not demonstrated a  right  to  remain  in  the
        United Kingdom under the regulations it is  arguably  rational  for
        the respondent to  conclude  that  the  residence  card  previously
        issued as recognition of such a right could lawfully be revoked.

    19. The evidence required for the appellant to establish his claim  had
        simply not been produced to the Judge.

    20. The challenge to the removal  of  the  applicant  from  the  United
        Kingdom does not make out arguable legal error.  As  the  appellant
        has no right to remain in the United Kingdom on any basis operation
        of law requires his removal. If the appellant claims he  should  be
        entitled to remain on the basis of the length of time he  has  been
        in the United Kingdom, which must equate to a private  life  claim,
        it is open to him to make a fresh application for leave  to  remain
        on such basis.




Decision

    21. There is no material error of law  in  the  Judge's  decision.  The
        determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.

    22. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.

I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.
