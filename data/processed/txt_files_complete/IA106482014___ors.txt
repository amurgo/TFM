Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr P Richardson, Counsel instructed by Morgan Mark
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Specialist Appeals Team

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing the appeals  of  the  first  and  fourth
    appellants against the decision by the Secretary of State to refuse  to
    grant them leave to remain as Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrants  on  the
    grounds that they had not shown they were  genuine  entrepreneurs.  The
    First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and I  do  not
    consider that such a direction is warranted for  these  proceedings  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The second and third appellants are related to the first appellant,  Mr
    Shah, as wife and daughter respectively.  They joined in the appeal  of
    Mr Shah as his dependants.

 3. Mr Shah and Mr Khalil are both nationals of Pakistan.  They applied for
    Tier 1 entrepreneur status as fellow directors of SM  Global  Financial
    Limited, a company  which  had  been  set  up  to  provide  bookkeeping
    services.  In support of their respective applications, they relied  on
    a Barclays Bank account  statement  showing  a  balance  in  excess  of
    �50,000 as of 10 July 2013; and a supply of services agreement  between
    SM Global Financial Limited and Afro Hair and Beauty (Halston)  Limited
    dated 15 August 2013.

 4. The appellants made their application on 15 July 2013,  and  they  were
    interviewed about their application on  16  October  2013.   They  were
    asked questions about the source of the funds which they said they were
    going to invest in the business, and about their business plan.

 5. In February 2014 the Secretary of State gave her reasons  for  refusing
    the applications.  The  reasons  were  contained  in  separate  refusal
    letters, but the grounds of refusal were to the same or similar effect.
     The Secretary of State was not satisfied that the appellants genuinely
    intended and were able to take over or become a director of one or more
    businesses within the next six months; or that they genuinely  intended
    to invest the money referred to  in  Table  4  of  Appendix  A  in  the
    Immigration Rules in their business or businesses; or  that  the  money
    referred to in Table 4 of Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration  Rules  was
    genuinely available to them and would remain available  to  them  until
    such time as it was spent by their business or businesses.

 6. In the refusal letter, the respondent referred to paragraph 245DD(i) of
    the Rule which stated that, in making the  assessment  in  subparagraph
    (h) of paragraph 245DD, the Home Office might  take  into  account  the
    following factors:

    (i)  the evidence the applicant has submitted;

    (ii)     the viability and credibility  of  the  source  of  the  money
         referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;

    (iii)    the viability and  credibility  of  the  applicant's  business
         plans and market research into their chosen business sector;

    (iv)     the applicant's previous educational and  business  experience
         (or lack thereof);

    ...

    (vii)    any other relevant information.

 7. On the topic of the viability and credibility  of  the  source  of  the
    money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A, the respondent referred  to
    the conflicting  answers  which  the  appellants  had  given  in  their
    respective interviews.  When asked in interview how he had obtained the
    funding of �50,000, Mr Khalil said the money was from his own  savings,
    and it came from Pakistan.  But after checking through his current bank
    account statements, there was no evidence  that  he  had  received  any
    money  from  Pakistan  as  claimed.   According  to  Mr  Khalil's  bank
    statements, he received a modest  monthly  salary  from  his  job  with
    Manpower.  So the respondent did not find it credible that he would  be
    able to save �25,000 as his half stake in his proposed business  whilst
    living and maintaining himself in the UK.  Also, looking  at  his  bank
    statements he had a total of �20,000 that had  been  deposited  in  his
    Barclays Bank  account  from  Mobile  -  Channel  FT.   When  asked  in
    interview where these funds had come from, he replied he did not  know,
    it could be his cousin's account.   The  respondent  did  not  find  it
    credible that neither he nor Mr Shah would  know  where  a  deposit  of
    �20,000 into the joint bank account originated from.

 8. Under the heading of the viability and credibility of  the  applicants'
    business plans and market research in their chosen business sector, the
    respondent said that  the  business  plan  was  heavily  based  on  the
    business plans found on various online websites, including  a  business
    plan for MIK Enterprise Limited and then KNOJ Limited, copies of  which
    had been copied and included with the refusal notice.  This  undermined
    the credibility of their business plan, which they claimed to  lay  out
    their business strategy for the operation of their  proposed  business.
    After checking  Yell.com,  the  respondent  found  at  least  40  other
    bookkeeping services within a two mile radius of their current  trading
    address.  Mr Khalil had stated in interview that he  had  one  contract
    for �1,500 from Afro Hair and Beauty in Halston,  and  had  received  a
    payment of �500 already.  But there was no deposit or payment from  the
    above named business into the company bank account.  He also stated  he
    had breached the contract, as he was  unable  to  fulfil  the  contract
    while he was awaiting a visa.  Looking at the contract, the wording  on
    the contract had the same wording as that  used  in  the  advertisement
    which he had placed in the Daily Jang.  The  respondent  therefore  did
    not find the contract supplied with the application to be credible. The
    chances of the business  being  successful  when  faced  with  so  many
    competitors  in  the  existing  area  seemed  unlikely  at  best.   The
    respondent did not see what his proposed  business  would  offer  which
    would  result  in  customers  of  other  bookkeeping  businesses  being
    attracted into becoming customers  of  the  appellants'  business.   It
    seemed that they had no clear idea of how their business would operate.
     Their answers at interview relating to their proposed business and the
    market research  were  generally  poor  and  lacking  in  detail.   The
    respondent was not satisfied that  the  appellants  had  a  viable  and
    credible business plan.





The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The appeal eventually came before Judge J D L Edwards  sitting  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal at Richmond Magistrates' Court on 24 November 2014.
     The judge was invited to take  into  account  a  bundle  of  documents
    compiled by the appellants' solicitors running to 142 pages.  The judge
    also received oral evidence from both Mr  Shah  and  Mr  Khalil,  whose
    evidence in rebuttal of the concerns raised in the refusal  letters  is
    summarised in  paragraphs  [20]  to  [22]  of  the  judge's  subsequent
    decision.

10. In the course of the hearing, Mr Richardson referred the judge  to  the
    case of Ahmed (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014]  UKUT  365.   The  head
    note of this decision reads as follows:

         1.   Where a provision of the Rules  (such  as  that  in  paragraph
             245DD(k)) provides that points will  not  be  awarded  if  the
             decision maker is not  satisfied  as  to  another  (non-points
             scoring) aspect of the Rule, the non-points scoring aspect and
             the requirement for points are inextricably linked.

         2.   As a result, the prohibition on new evidence in s85A(4) of the
             Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  applies  to  the
             non-points scoring aspect of the Rule: the prohibition  is  in
             relation to new evidence that goes to the scoring of points.

11. In his subsequent decision, the judge referred to  Ahmed  at  paragraph
    [7].  He summarised the effect of the decision as being  that  where  a
    PBS application is made and refused, the assessment of the judge is  to
    be made on the material that was before the decision maker, rather than
    a new consideration of new material.  It must not be on the basis  that
    a different way of presenting the application  would  have  produced  a
    different result.  He recorded Mr Richardson as  protesting  that  this
    was unfair and unappealable, but that  he  was  constrained  to  follow
    Ahmed.

12. The judge's findings were set out from paragraph [25] onwards.  He  did
    not find Mr Khalil and Shah to be the most impressive witnesses,  being
    prone to long rambling answers that were not  responsive  to  questions
    asked of them.

13. At paragraph [26] he did not accept Mr  Richardson's  proposition  that
    the respondent was precluded from asking questions about the source  of
    funds in a bank statement relied on by the applicants:

         In this case Mr Khalil and Mr Shah have both  given  unsatisfactory
         answers touching their income and,  particularly  expenditure  over
         the years so as to allow them to build up the level of savings they
         claim.  It would appear that for substantial periods both have been
         remarkably  parsimonious  on  the  amounts  they  have   spent   on
         themselves.

14. At paragraph [27], the judge said he was troubled by  one  of  the  pay
    slips at page 88 of the appellants' bundle.  At paragraph [28] he  said
    there was a further problem with the profit and loss account  allegedly
    prepared by the appellants' accountants.  He noted  that  it  had  been
    altered  in  manuscript,  and  he  did  not  accept  that  a  competent
    accountant would act in this way.  At paragraph [29], he  said  he  was
    further troubled by the contradictory answers given by Mr Shah  and  Mr
    Khalil in interview as to how they knew each other.  One said they were
    cousins, but the other made no mention of the family relationship.   At
    paragraph [30], he said that, looking  at  the  business  plan  in  the
    round, Mr Shah and Mr Khalil had  some  academic  training  that  might
    transfer to their sphere of work.  But there was little before  him  to
    confirm what the extent of the market  for  their  services  might  be,
    other  than  one  small  contract.   He  did  not  accept  that   local
    accountants would be prepared to subcontract work to  them,  in  effect
    acting against their own best interests.  He  did  not  accept  that  a
    rebate of 50p an hour over a trained accountant's fee would act  as  an
    incentive to transfer custom; and in any event �10  an  hour  seemed  a
    remarkably cheap rate for an accountant anyway.

15. He concluded at paragraph [31]  that  the  appellants  had  not  placed
    before  him  sufficient  evidence  to  establish  on   a   balance   of
    probabilities that they met all the requirements of the Rules.

16. The judge went on to dismiss the appeal under the Rules, and also under
    Article 8 ECHR.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

17. Mr Richardson settled an application for permission to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal on behalf of the appellants.   Ground  1  was  that  the
    judge had failed to approach the evidence that  was  before  him  in  a
    consistent way, and had failed to make it clear upon what  evidence  he
    was basing his conclusions.  On the assumption that Ahmed was correctly
    decided, which was not accepted by Mr Richardson, it followed that  the
    judge could only have regard  to  the  evidence  that  was  before  the
    decision maker when determining the  appeal.   Accordingly,  the  judge
    could not have any regard to the new evidence in the 142 page bundle to
    which he referred in paragraph  [7]  of  his  decision.   It  was  also
    submitted that, if Ahmed was correct, the judge could not  have  regard
    to the oral evidence of the appellants about the genuineness  of  their
    intentions and the availability of funds.  Accordingly,  the  reasoning
    in paragraphs [25] and [26] of the decision was materially flawed.  The
    Tribunal could not have its cake  and  eat  it.   If  new  evidence  is
    prohibited, a judge could not cherry  pick  those  parts  of  such  new
    evidence that he felt harmed an  appellant's  case,  and  ignore  those
    parts which assisted the appellant's case.

18. Ground 2 was that the judge had failed to address a point of  law  that
    Mr Richardson had raised at the hearing.   If  Ahmed  was  correct,  it
    followed that the appellants were the victims of common law unfairness,
    applying Naveed (Student - fairness - notice of points) [2012] UKUT 14,
    as the effect of Ahmed was to deprive the appellants of the opportunity
    to provide further evidence of the genuineness of their business or  of
    the provenance of the funds that  they  intended  to  invest  in  their
    business.  If it is right that they could not produce such evidence  on
    appeal, the decision of the Secretary of State was "common law unfair",
    and the First-tier Tribunal Judge should have so ruled.

19. Ground 3 was that the reasoning of the judge in paragraphs  [27],  [29]
    and [31] was flawed.  It was  particularly  unfair  for  the  judge  to
    criticise the appellants in  paragraph  [31]  for  not  putting  enough
    evidence before him.  Firstly, the judge would not have been  permitted
    to look at the same  (applying  Ahmed)  and  secondly,  the  judge  had
    ignored nearly all the new evidence that had been placed before him.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

20. On 27 January 2015  Designated  Judge  Garratt  granted  permission  to
    appeal on grounds 1 and 2 for the following reasons:

         Whilst the third ground appears to be no more than  a  disagreement
         with the reasoned findings of the judge the first two grounds  have
         arguable merit.  That is because the  decision  does  not  make  it
         clear how the judge approached evidence submitted by the  appellant
         which post-dated the application, such as the pay slip  and  profit
         and loss account referred  to  in  paragraphs  27  and  28  of  the
         decision.  Further, although the judge appears to  have  considered
         the appeal  on  the  basis  of  the  genuineness  of  the  proposed
         business, it is not explained why the specific aspects of paragraph
         245D of the  Immigration  Rules,  to  which  the  judge  refers  in
         paragraph 4, had not been met by the appellants.

The Rule 24 Response

21. John Parkinson of  the  Specialist  Appeals  Team  settled  a  Rule  24
    response opposing the appeal. He observed that it was  somewhat  ironic
    that the appellants were relying on s85A to disqualify the  judge  from
    considering evidence that they had submitted. Any error of law was  not
    material:

         Given  the  appellants'  clear  inability  to  demonstrate  to  the
         respondent on the evidence that they met the rules the appeal would
         have fallen to be dismissed.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

22. At the hearing before me, Mr Bramble agreed with Mr Richardson that the
    effect of Ahmed was to render inadmissible some of the evidence  relied
    on by the judge as undermining the appellants' case.   But  Mr  Bramble
    submitted that the judge's reasoning in paragraph [26]  was  sufficient
    to sustain the conclusion that the appellants had  not  discharged  the
    burden of proving that the Secretary of State had been wrong to  refuse
    their application by reference to subparagraph (h) of paragraph  245DD.



23. Mr Richardson accepted that the judge's  reasoning  in  paragraph  [26]
    related to what the appellants had said in interview, and was therefore
    admissible evidence.  But he submitted that the  judge  had  not  given
    adequate  reasons  at  paragraph  [26],  as  he  had  not  listed   the
    unsatisfactory answers by Mr  Khalil  and  Mr  Shah  to  which  he  was
    referring.

24. He submitted that the judge had not adequately addressed  the  specific
    points advanced against the appellants in the  refusal  decisions,  and
    that the appellants had thereby been deprived of a fair hearing in  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Consequentially, he submitted that  the  decision
    should be set aside in its entirety, and  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a de novo hearing.  In addition, Mr Shah had  now  accrued
    ten years' lawful residence in the United Kingdom, and he invited me to
    direct the respondent to decide whether Mr Shah qualified for leave  to
    remain on the grounds of long residence.

25. Mr Richardson agreed that, in the light of  the  stance  which  he  was
    taking by way of appeal to the UT, the rehearing of the Tier 1  appeals
    in the FTT would be a  submissions  only  hearing.   He  would  not  be
    calling the appellants as witnesses, and he would not be relying on any
    documentary evidence that was not before the Secretary of State at  the
    time of decision.  In the circumstances, Mr Bramble submitted  that  it
    would be appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to remake the decision,  if
    an error of law was found.

26. I reserved my decision on whether there was a  material  error  of  law
    such that the decision should  be  set  aside;  and,  if  there  was  a
    material error of law, the  forum  in  which  the  decision  should  be
    remade.

Discussion

     Grounds 1 and 3

27. It is agreed by the parties that most of the reasons given by the judge
    for dismissing the appeal do not stand up to scrutiny.  This is  either
    because the reasons relate to new evidence tendered by way  of  appeal,
    which is inadmissible following Ahmed, or, in  the  case  of  paragraph
    [29], because the criticism does not stand up  to  scrutiny.   Although
    the  refusal  letters  accused  Mr  Shah  and  Mr  Khalil   of   giving
    contradictory answers on the question of how they knew each  other,  Mr
    Bramble accepts that on a fair reading  of  the  interview  transcripts
    this particular allegation is without merit.

28. However, one of the two  main  reasons  given  by  the  respondent  for
    disputing  that  the  appellants  are  genuine  entrepreneurs  was  the
    credibility of the source of  their  investment  funds.   Although  the
    judge does not detail "the unsatisfactory answers" given by Mr Shah and
    Mr Khalil in their respective interviews, they are clearly set  out  in
    the refusal decisions. The discrepancies  highlighted  in  the  refusal
    letters are  unanswerable  and  will  remain  so,  as  Mr  Richardson's
    position is that the appellants cannot and will not adduce any evidence
    which addresses them. Of particular note is that neither Mr Khalil  nor
    Mr Shah was able to explain  the  deposit  of  �20,000  from  Mobile  -
    Channel FT.  This sum represented 40% of the funds said to be available
    for investment, and the inability of either entrepreneurial team member
    to explain the origin of these funds reasonably led to  the  conclusion
    that they had not shown that �50,000 of investment funds was  genuinely
    available to them.

29. It may be the case that the appellants did not receive a  fair  hearing
    on the new evidence relied on at the hearing, but that is now  accepted
    to be irrelevant.  So I have not reviewed the new evidence  to  see  to
    what extent it retrospectively bolsters the appellants' credibility.

30. I have however reviewed the interview record on  which  the  respondent
    based her adverse decision. I have not been shown, nor am I  persuaded,
    that the appellants did not receive a fair hearing  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the crucial question of whether the Secretary of State  was
    right to refuse the application on  credibility  grounds,  based  inter
    alia on the appellants' performance in interview.

31. The other main ground for disputing that the  appellants  were  genuine
    entrepreneurs was the viability and credibility of their business plan.
     Although the business plan was not apparently put before the judge, it
    was not disputed that the plan  was  plagiarised  from  business  plans
    published  on  the  internet,  including  the  business  plan  for  MIK
    Enterprise Limited.  In argument before me, Mr Richardson accepted that
    the role of the judicial decision maker in an appeal such  as  this  is
    more than simply discharging a reviewing function, as would be the case
    in an application for judicial review.  Accordingly,  it  was  open  to
    Judge Edwards to endorse  any  concerns  expressed  by  the  respondent
    regarding the viability and credibility  of  the  appellants'  business
    plan and market research into their chosen business  sector,  which  he
    does in paragraph [31].

32. I do not consider that Ahmed prevents the judicial decision maker  from
    taking into account evidence which is adduced, or  elicited  in  cross-
    examination, on the topic of a  business  plan  whose  credibility  and
    viability has been discussed and challenged in the refusal decision.

33. In conclusion, although much of the reasoning  of  the  judge  must  be
    disregarded, there is a sufficient body of sustainable reasoning  going
    to the two main concerns ventilated in the refusal decision such as  to
    constitute adequate reasons for dismissing the appeals of Mr  Shah  and
    Mr Khalil.

    Ground 2

34. In Ahmed, the First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed the appeal of the  Tier
    1 entrepreneurs because  the  new  evidence  which  they  had  provided
    persuaded her that they were genuine entrepreneurs.   After  the  Upper
    Tribunal set  aside  her  decision  as  being  erroneous  in  law,  the
    representative for the entrepreneurs informed the UT  that  they  would
    like to withdraw their appeal, rather than have it remade, on the basis
    that they were instead going to make a new application supported by the
    new evidence which had become available to them, "no doubt  during  the
    course of the business which they have been seeking to run  ever  since
    they set it up at the end of 2012".

35. It is open to the appellants to make a new application, relying on  new
    evidence which addresses the concerns raised by the respondent  in  the
    refusal letters.

36. This is a partial answer to Ground 2.  The  UT  in  Ahmed  saw  nothing
    unfair in the  applicants  being  refused  on  credibility  grounds  by
    reference to the pre-decision evidence, and not being able  to  succeed
    in their appeal by reference to post-decision evidence, even though  it
    retrospectively established that they had  been  genuine  entrepreneurs
    all along.

37. These cases are  distinguishable  from  the  paradigm  case  of  Naveed
    because the grounds of refusal  cannot  reasonably  be  categorised  as
    grounds "of which he did not know and could not have known". The  rules
    specify the specific matters which are taken into account by  the  SSHD
    in assessing whether a Tier 1 entrepreneur application is genuine,  and
    the fact that the appellants were invited to an interview carried  with
    it the implied threat  that  they  might  be  subsequently  refused  on
    credibility grounds if their performance in interview was deemed to  be
    unsatisfactory.

38. So the decisions appealed against were in accordance with the law,  and
    the appellants were not victims of common law unfairness.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  These appeals against the  refusal  of
leave to remain, and against concomitant removal decisions under Section  47
of the 2006 Act, are dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.



Signed                              Date
