                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

      1. I have considered whether any parties require the protection of  an
         anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in
         respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the  circumstances
         and evidence I do not consider it necessary to  make  an  anonymity
         direction.

      2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-
         tier Tribunal Judge Holt  promulgated  on  9  February  2015  which
         dismissed the Appellant's appeal on all grounds.




Background

      3. The Appellant was born on 11 May 1993 and is a  national  of  South
         Africa.

      4. On 29 October 2009 the Appellant applied for asylum.  On  22  March
         2010 the asylum application  was  refused  but  the  Appellant  was
         granted discretionary leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  until
         11 November 2010 when he reached 17 ï¿½.  On  10  November  2010  the
         Appellant made an application for further leave to remain and  this
         was refused on 9 February 2011 and was  reconsidered  on  23  March
         2011 and refused on 12 July 2011 and reconsidered on 26 August 2011
         and refused again. The Appellant lodged  a  further  appeal  on  21
         September 2011 and then the refusal decision was  withdrawn  to  be
         reconsidered and the decision subject of this appeal was made on 10
         November 2014.  The  reasons  for  refusal  can  be  summarised  as
         follows:

          a) The claim that he would have no where to live is not one which
             engages the convention.

          b)  The  Appellant  had  given  contradictory  accounts  of   his
             relationship with his family in South Africa and therefore  it
             was not accepted that he had no where to go.

          c) The Appellant had produced  a  further  witness  statement  in
             support of his further application for  leave  addressing  the
             contradictions but it was noted that the Appellant  would  now
             be returning as an adult and it was still asserted that he had
             family there.

          d) The failure of the Respondent in trying to  trace  his  family
             had not disadvantaged the Appellant.

          e) The Appellant does not have a  British  partner  or  child  so
             cannot meet the requirements of Appendix FM.

          f) The Appellant has family in  South  Africa  and  therefore  he
             failed to demonstrate that he had no

The Judge's Decision

      5.  The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and   was
         unrepresented at the appeal. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Holt  ("the
         Judge") dismissed the appeal against the Respondent's decision. The
         Judge found :

          a) The Appellant and his sister Albertina  gave  evidence  before
             the Judge who found them 'pleasant and polite' and found  that
             they did not exaggerate and she had a degree of  sympathy  for
             them.

          b) The Appellant in evidence admitted he had no basis for fearing
             torture , inhuman or degrading treatment.

          c) His claim was based on the fact that he had lived  in  the  UK
             since 2009 with his grandmother Lucy who he described  as  his
             mother, and his sister Albertina.

          d) The Appellant gave evidence that it would  be  very  difficult
             for him to adapt to life in South Africa.

          e) He admitted that he had relatives there  including  his  birth
             mother and an aunt but they were living in precarious economic
             circumstances and would not be able to care for him.

          f) The Judge found that he would not qualify under Appendix FM or
             paragraph 276 ADE and therefore concluded that this was a case
             for consideration under Article 8 outside the Rules.

          g) She set out the five questions under  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27
             against  that  factual  background  and  determined  that  the
             assessment came down to proportionality  and  found  that  the
             decision was proportionate.

      6. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that the reasoning in respect
         of paragraph 276 ADE (vi) was not sufficiently reasoned; there were
         no findings about the testimony of the second witness.

      7.  On 4 March 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson gave  permission
         to appeal on both grounds.

      8. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Moksud on behalf of  the
         Appellant that :

          a) The reasons why the Appellant could not meet the provisions of
             paragraph 276ADE were not adequately reasoned.

          b) When asked which provision he could arguably meet  that  would
             make tgis error material Mr Moksud conceded that he could  not
             meet any of them but the reasons for this were not set out.

          c) He stated that the Judge failed to discuss or give  weight  to
             the evidence of the Appellant's sister's evidence. He accepted
             that this may have made no difference to the  outcome  of  the
             case but it may have but was unable to articulate for me  what
             evidence she gave might have made a difference and why.

      9. On behalf of the Respondent  Ms Johnson submitted that :

          a) At the time of the application the Appellant was  16years  old
             and given the period he had lived in the  United  Kingdom  the
             provisions of paragraph 276ADE could not be met.

          b) The Judge looked at Article 8 outside the Rules.

          c) The sister was an adult. There was no evidence that given that
             they could not continue their family life in South Africa.

Legal Framework

     10. It is now generally accepted that the new IRs  do  not  provide  in
         advance for every  nuance  in  the  application  of  Article  8  in
         individual cases. At para 30 of Nagre, Sales J said:

         "30.     ... if, after the process of applying the  new  rules  and
             finding that the claim for leave to remain under  them  fails,
             the relevant official or tribunal judge considers it is  clear
             that the consideration under the Rules has fully addressed any
             family life or private life issues arising under Article 8, it
             would be sufficient simply to say that; they would not have to
             go on, in addition, to consider the case separately  from  the
             Rules. If there is no arguable case that  there  may  be  good
             grounds for granting leave to  remain  outside  the  Rules  by
             reference to Article 8, there would be no point in introducing
             full separate consideration of Article 8  again  after  having
             reached a decision on application of the Rules."

     11. This was also endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Singh  and  Khalid
         where Underhill LJ said (at para 64):

         "64.      ...  there  is  no  need  to  conduct  a  full   separate
             examination of article 8  outside  the  Rules  where,  in  the
             circumstances of a particular case, all the issues  have  been
             addressed in the consideration under the Rules."

     12. More recently the Court of Appeal in SS Congo [2015] EWCA  Civ  387
         stated in paragraph 33:

             "In our judgment, even though a test  of  exceptionality  does
             not apply in every case falling within the scope  of  Appendix
             FM, it is accurate to say that the  general  position  outside
             the sorts of  special  contexts  referred  to  above  is  that
             compelling  circumstances  would  need  to  be  identified  to
             support a claim for grant of LTR  outside  the  new  Rules  in
             Appendix FM. In our view, that is a formulation which  is  not
             as strict as a test of  exceptionality  or  a  requirement  of
             "very compelling reasons" (as referred to in MF  (Nigeria)  in
             the context of the Rules applicable to foreign criminals), but
             which gives appropriate weight to the focused consideration of
             public interest factors as finds expression in  the  Secretary
             of State's formulation of the new Rules  in  Appendix  FM.  It
             also reflects the formulation in Nagre at  para.  [29],  which
             has been tested and has survived scrutiny in this court:  see,
             e.g., Haleemudeen at [44], per Beatson LJ."(my bold)

     13. In an Article 8 assessment  the  Tribunal  is  also  to  take  into
         account  Section 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
         Act 2002 (as amended by the Immigration Act 2014)  which  sets  out
         the public interest considerations that I must have  regard  to  in
         determining proportionality.

Finding on Material Error

     14. Having heard those submissions I reached the  conclusion  that  the
         Tribunal made no material errors of law.

     15. I remind myself of what was said in Shizad (sufficiency of reasons:
         set aside) Afghanistan [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC) about  the  requirement
         for sufficient reasons to be given in a decision in  headnote  (1):
         "Although there is a legal duty to give a brief explanation of  the
         conclusions on the central issue on which an appeal is  determined,
         those reasons need not be extensive if  the  decision  as  a  whole
         makes sense, having regard to the material accepted by the judge."

     16. The first challenge to the Judge's decision was  that  insufficient
         reasons were given as to why  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the
         private life requirements of paragraph 276ADE  of  the  Immigration
         Rules.

     17. Mr Moksud was unable to advance an argument that failure to set out
         why the Appellant could not meet the private life requirements  was
         material to this decision on the basis that it was arguable that he
         could meet any of the provisions. I am satisfied that in  fact  the
         Appellant could not meet any of the provisions that would have  led
         to success under this  Rule.   The  undisputed  background  to  the
         Appellant's application was that he had come to the United  Kingdom
         in 2009 when he was 16 years old made the application  for  further
         leave in 2010 when he was 17 years old. Paragraph 276 ADE sets  out
         various avenues by which an applicant can rely on private  life  in
         the United Kingdom under the Rules. While not explicitly  referring
         to each route the Appellant had not lived in the United Kingdom for
         over 20 years and therefore could not fulfil the criteria  for  276
         ADE(iii) ); while under 18 had not lived in the United Kingdom  for
         7 years and therefore 276ADE(iv) did not assist; while under 18 and
         under 25 he had not spent at least half  his  life  in  the  United
         Kingdom and therefore 276ADE (v) did not apply and finally  he  was
         not over 18 at the time of  application  and  therefore  could  not
         benefit from 276ADE(vi). Perhaps the Judge could have set  out  her
         reasoning more fully but  it  could  not  have  made  any  material
         difference to the outcome as  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the
         requirements of the Rule.

     18. It was suggested that there was no finding about the  testimony  of
         the second Appellant who  was  the  Appellant's  sister.  Again  Mr
         Moksud failed to articulate it what way this was material  or  what
         aspect of her evidence could have made a difference to the  outcome
         in this case. The only issue in the case  was  whether  there  were
         compelling reasons not covered by the Rules that warranted a  grant
         of leave outside the Rules. In so  far  as  the  sister's  evidence
         might be of relevance that was  the  issue  it  would  have  to  be
         relevant to.I further remind myself that as a matter  of  principle
         the Judge is not required to summarise or indeed make  findings  in
         relation to every witness in the case.

     19.  The Judge rightly concluded that this case was an assessment under
         Article 8 outside the Rules and carried out a  detailed  assessment
         by reference to the questions posed by  Razgar.  Indeed  the  Judge
         while not particularly detailed the Judge  took  into  account  the
         sisters evidence at paragraph 5 and at paragraph 14. She  concluded
         that given that the sister's status in the United  Kingdom  was  by
         her own evidence something that could be categorised as  precarious
         she was likely to be returning to South Africa also. Given that the
         assessment of proportionality involves  an  assessment  of  whether
         family life can reasonably be enjoyed elsewhere in  this  case  she
         took  into  account  that  the  relationship  between  these  adult
         siblings could in all likelihood continue in South Africa.

     20. I am also bound to  say  that  in  assessing  the  public  interest
         factors the Judge should have considered (but did  not  explicitly)
         those matters set out in paragraph 117B of the  Nationality  Asylum
         and Immigration act 2002 which would have included,  amongst  other
         things, a finding that little weight should be given to  a  private
         life  established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when  the   person's
         immigration status is precarious.  So  again  it  is  difficult  to
         determine in what way the evidence of a sister that the Judge found
         was also likely to be returning to South Africa could have  made  a
         difference to the outcome.

     21. I was therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when  read
         as a whole set out findings that were sustainable and  sufficiently
         detailed and based on cogent reasoning.

CONCLUSION

     22. I therefore found that no errors of law have been  established  and
         that the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

     23. The appeal is dismissed.
