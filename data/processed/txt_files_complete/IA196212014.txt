For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appellant's appeal against a decision  made  by  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Abebrese) promulgated on 28  April  2015  in  which  he
    dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  on   immigration   grounds   under
    paragraph 245ZH.  In a determination the First-tier Tribunal dealt with
    a preliminary issue as to whether or not there was a  right  of  appeal
    and that was dealt with in the appellant's favour.

2.   The issue before the Tribunal was whether or not the appellant  had  in
    fact spent three years studying on courses  below  degree  level.   The
    First-tier Tribunal found that the appellant had not studied on courses
    at or above degree level and found that  the  courses  were  below  and
    therefore could not meet the requirements of 245ZX(h).  The  First-tier
    Tribunal went on to consider whether paragraph 276ADE and/or Article  8
    outside of the Rules applied and dismissed the appeal.

3.    The  grounds  of  the  application  for  permission  argued  that  the
    respondent failed to explain how the three years studying below  degree
    level was worked out and reference was made in the Reasons for  Refusal
    Letter to a period of two years and some  months  not  specified.   The
    First-tier Tribunal failed to explain  the  reasons  for  reaching  its
    conclusion that there was a period of three years studying below degree
    level.

4.   Permission was then granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Osborne on  16
    July 2015 who found an arguable error of law with reference to an Ofqal
    diagram  which  accompanied  the  grounds  showing  that  level  7  was
    equivalent to postgraduate course.

5.   This afternoon I have heard submissions from  Miss  Jones  and  briefly
    from Mr Walker who agreed with Miss Jones' submissions and the proposed
    outcome.  I am satisfied that there was an error of law in the Tribunal
    decision and indeed in the original reasons for refusal. The  Secretary
    of State did not specify in terms of years or studies how it  was  that
    the appellant did not meet the requirements of the relevant  Rules.   I
    have evidence in the form of CAS documentation in a bundle produced for
    today's hearing which shows and  I  find  that  the  appellant  studied
    initially on a level 7 course and further that in fact  the  length  of
    the non-degree studies was two years.

Notice of Decision

6.   I find that there was a material error of law in the decision  which  I
    set aside.  I remake the decision and substitute a  decision  to  allow
    the appeal on immigration grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of ï¿½140.00 for the following reason.  The refusal  decision  made  was
wrong in fact and the Tribunal Judge failed to consider the same.
