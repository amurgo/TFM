                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Khan promulgated on 22 July 2015 brought with the permission of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett granted on 2 December 2015.


2.   Although before me the Secretary of  State  is  the  appellant  and  Mr
    Oskorus is the  respondent,  for  the  sake  of  consistency  with  the
    proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal I shall hereafter  refer  to
    Mr Oskorus  as  the  Appellant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    Respondent.


3.   The Appellant is  a  citizen  of  Singapore,  born  on  1  April  1988.
    Although it is not abundantly clear on the papers,  I  have  been  told
    today that he acquired his citizenship of Singapore in 2008.  Prior  to
    that he had been a citizen of Serbia, but his parents had relocated  to
    Singapore in 1995 (when the Appellant was  7)  and  the  Appellant  had
    remained living there up until the time that he  acquired  citizenship,
    at which point he also renounced his Serbian citizenship - it  is  said
    that the renouncement of his previous citizenship was  a  condition  of
    the acquisition of Singaporean citizenship. The Appellant's parents are
    not nationals of Singapore  and  currently  live  in  Dubai,  with  his
    sister.


4.   The Appellant was schooled in Singapore  and  formed  the  ambition  to
    study acting with a view to pursuing acting as a career.  To  this  end
    he came to the United Kingdom for two  relatively  short  courses,  and
    then later again entered the United Kingdom on 4 January  2009  with  a
    student visa to pursue a degree in acting.   Towards  the  end  of  his
    period of leave on 17 November 2014 the Appellant made  an  application
    to remain on the basis of his private life.


5.   The background to the Appellant's case is set out in some  considerable
    detail in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  is  otherwise  a
    matter of record on file. I do not propose to rehearse again  all  such
    details, but will  make  reference  to  matters  as  is  necessary  and
    incidental to my considerations.


Consideration: Error of Law

6.   In making his application  the  Appellant  was  asked  on  the  FLR(FP)
    application form to which country he would go if required to leave  the
    United Kingdom.  He specified Singapore.  He had also indicated on  his
    application form amongst other things that  he  had  visited  Singapore
    last in December 2011 (see section  10.3  at  A28)  and  amongst  other
    languages spoke Malaysian (see section 10.4).  He also stated  that  he
    has "some friends but no relatives in Singapore"  (see  section  10.5),
    his parents and sister having departed to  take  up  residence  in  the
    United Arab Emirates.


7.   In a letter of representation submitted in support of  the  Appellant's
    application,  and  a   statement   enclosed   with   that   letter   of
    representation, further details were given of the  Appellant's  history
    which included the fact that he had visited  Singapore  whilst  in  the
    United Kingdom "usually for Christmas and New Year's celebration, 2010,
    2011, 2012".  Further reference was made to  friends  in  Singapore  in
    these terms:

         "I have some friends in Singapore with whom I grew up with but they
         have their own lives, couple of them  are  married  and  busy  with
         their own lives and others were offshore for seven to eight months,
         none of them are in the acting professions in which all my  current
         close friendships are."


8.   The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  in  considering  the  Appellant's  case
    allowed the appeal pursuant  to  paragraph  276ADE(1)  with  particular
    reference to subparagraph (vi).   In  the  alternative  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge also allowed  the  appeal  by  reference  to  Article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules.


9.   As regards the Immigration Rules the  Judge  correctly  identified  the
    relevant test at paragraph 11 of his decision in the following terms:

         "The Appellant has to prove that being aged 18 years or  above  and
         having lived continuously in the UK for  less  than  twenty  years,
         there would be very significant obstacles to his  integration  into
         the country to which he would have to go if required to  leave  the
         UK, namely Singapore."




10.  The Appellant's case was put to the Judge in this regard on  the  basis
    of the factors summarised at paragraph 9 of the determination which  to
    a substantial extent the Judge  accepted  in  his  own  conclusions  at
    paragraph 13.  Paragraph 13 is in these terms:

         "I find that very significant obstacles do exist for the  following
         reasons, namely that the Appellant left Singapore in 2008 and he no
         longer retains any connections with that country.  His  parents  no
         longer live there and do not intend to return as  they  are  living
         and working in Dubai.  After the length of time that the  Appellant
         has been away from Singapore, I find that he has no longer retained
         any ties to the country.  He would have to pursue his career as  an
         actor in Singapore which would be extremely difficult because there
         would be a very limited opportunity to do theatre work, if any.  In
         relation to film work, this would be Asian based and the  Appellant
         has a very limited knowledge of any  of  the  indigenous  languages
         spoken in Singapore.  He went to an English speaking school."


11.   In  my  judgment  none  of  those  factors,  either  individually   or
    cumulatively, approach evidence of very significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's integration into Singapore.  Indeed much of the emphasis of
    the decision - both in terms of the evidence presented and the findings
    of the Judge - relate to the Appellant's chosen career of acting.   For
    my part I do not consider that not being able to pursue a chosen career
    is of itself capable of amounting to 'an obstacle  to  integration'  in
    the absence of compelling evidence to suggest  that  an  individual  is
    insufficiently  capable  to  adapt  to  finding  some  other  means  of
    supporting themselves economically.  It simply means that the Appellant
    would have to find some other process by  which  he  could  financially
    support himself in the country of his  nationality.   Not  becoming  an
    actor - which in the precarious nature of that profession is a possible
    outcome anywhere in the world - will not  in  the  ordinary  course  of
    events prevent this Appellant (or any other frustrated  thespian)  from
    forming a social group, or finding  employment,  in  the  same  way  as
    failing to become a lawyer, an accountant or a mechanic  could  not  be
    considered to be an obstacle to integration per se.


12.  As regards the fact that the Appellant has been absent  from  Singapore
    for a period of time, I note that he has nonetheless  made  visits  and
    has referred to the continuing presence of some friends there.  It  may
    be that he has not in recent times had close  contact  with  them,  but
    there is nothing to suggest here that he would not be able to re-awaken
    such contact or, in any event,  seek  to  integrate  himself  into  the
    country in which he lived for so many of his  formative  years  and  in
    respect of  which  he  has  performed  military  service  and  acquired
    nationality.  It seems to me that the submissions advanced at paragraph
    9, and the acceptance of those submissions at paragraph 13, are both  -
    with all due respect - fundamentally flawed and do not go to  the  real
    question posed by the Rule,  which  is  the  question  of  integration.
    Rather they address matters such as ties and preference.


13.  For those reasons I have  little  hesitation  in  concluding  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge has erred in law in his  approach  under  the
    Immigration Rules.


14.  As regards the approach in respect of Article 8,  Ms  Daykin  has  very
    fairly today acknowledged that there is substance to the  Secretary  of
    State's challenge.  In particular she acknowledges that the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge has not had due and proper regard to section 117B(5)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  She also very fairly
    and properly acknowledges that she is not able to suggest that such  an
    omission is anything other  than  material  to  the  overall  balancing
    exercise under Article 8, and to that extent she acknowledges that  she
    is in difficulty in resisting the Secretary of State's challenge.


15.  In those circumstances it is unnecessary  for  me  to  explore  in  any
    greater detail the substance of the decision in respect of  Article  8:
    suffice it to say it is acknowledged, and  I  accept,  that  the  Judge
    erred in law.


16.  It follows that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  must  be
    set aside and requires to be re-made.




Remaking the decision in the appeal

17.  After a brief discussion with the representatives it was common  ground
    that it was possible to re-make  the  decision  on  the  basis  of  the
    documentary evidence that has been filed in this  appeal,  the  primary
    findings of fact  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  and  the
    submissions of the representatives - without the need to  hear  further
    oral evidence. I heard submissions accordingly.


18.  In the circumstances of my  reasoning  and  conclusion  in  respect  of
    'error of law' under the Immigration Rules I find that the appeal under
    the Rules must be  dismissed.   However  the  appeal  under  Article  8
    requires further consideration.


19.  The Appellant's case under Article 8 is  based  on  his  private  life.
    Whilst, in  the  usual  way,  he  has  made  acquaintances  and  formed
    friendships whilst studying in the UK, it is not apparent that there is
    anything unusual or  particularly  compelling  about  such  matters  in
    themselves. That is not to disregard them, but to observe that they are
    not favourably determinative; nonetheless in the overall balance I have
    accorded  some  favourable  weight  to  the  significant   numbers   of
    supporting letters from friends that speak fondly of the  Appellant  in
    personal terms, and appreciatively about him in terms of his dedication
    to his craft.


20.  However, the particular matters in this case that set  the  Appellant's
    case apart from the circumstances of so many other students  who  might
    seek to remain in the UK beyond the period of  their  studies,  is  the
    essentially vocational nature  of  the  Appellant's  studies,  and  the
    inability to pursue that vocation in the country of his nationality.


21.  In this context I note in particular the following matters:

    (i) The Appellant's parents describe  the  Appellant  as  demonstrating
    early talent at the age of 4 by imitating various singers'  voices  and
    choreographies; in kindergarten he would take key roles in performances
    put on for parents; and from an early age expressed a desire to  be  an
    actor.

    (ii) The Appellant has studied acting from the  age  of  11,  attending
    London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) courses in Singapore.

    (iii) In 2008 the Appellant attended a 6 months  Foundation  Course  in
    Acting at The Oxford School of Drama in Woodstock in the UK.


    (iv) In 2009 he returned to the UK for  a  three-month  course  at  the
    London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.


    (v) The Appellant's Tier 4 (General) Student Visa was granted in  order
    for him to study a BA (Honours) degree course in Professional Acting at
    LAMDA,  which  he  completed  in  July  2014.  This  is  an   extremely
    competitive course: the Appellant suggests that out of 4000  applicants
    only 28 are successful.

    (v) The Principal of LAMDA, Ms Joanna Read, has written in  support  of
    the Appellant stating him to be "a  hard-working  industrious  student"
    and to have "the potential for a sustainable career as an actor in  the
    UK and to succeed in his profession".


    (vi) One of the teachers on his course, Ms Judith Phillips, writes that
    the Appellant is a "committed person, with a strong  desire  to  pursue
    his career in acting", in addition to referring to "his  dreams  as  an
    actor", and his hard work "to fulfil his aim".


    (vii) There is evidence of limited scope for the Appellant to pursue an
    acting career in Singapore. The focus is in an  Eastern  audience,  and
    insofar as more Western productions might be put on they are  performed
    in 'Singlish' with Asian actors being preferred.


22.  In my judgement it  is  clear  that  there  is  a  powerful  vocational
    element to the Appellant's wish to pursue an acting career: the  desire
    to  act  is  an  important  aspect  of   his   identity,   a   defining
    characteristic as to who he is. He described acting in his own words as
    "my passion which has consumed me for most of my life".


23.  I accept that he has pursued  his  vocation  for  as  long  as  he  can
    remember, from early childhood to the present. I also  accept  that  he
    has done so with a focus on the English language and theatre as  it  is
    performed in the West. I accept that he has no realistic  opportunities
    to pursue his acting dreams in Singapore. Accordingly  the  removal  of
    the  Appellant  in  consequence  of  the  Respondent's  decision  would
    constitute a grave interference with that  aspect  of  the  Appellant's
    identity by which he fundamentally seeks to define himself, and  around
    which he has shaped the rest of his life.


24.  There is a further unusual element in this  appeal.  The  Appellant  is
    not by origin Singaporean. He came to reside in that country by  reason
    of his parents' temporary relocation, and only acquired citizenship  as
    recently as 2008. When the Appellant reached the age of 18  because  he
    was the child of someone with Singapore residence he  was  required  to
    undertake military service; upon  completion  of  his  service  he  was
    offered citizenship on the  condition  that  he  renounce  his  Serbian
    citizenship; it appears that  he  opted  for  this  citizenship  as  he
    thought there would be fewer travel  restrictions  for  a  national  of
    Singapore compared to a national of Serbia. Whilst it  cannot  be  said
    that the Appellant does  not  have  connections  in  Singapore,  in  my
    judgement he cannot be said to  be  a  'patrial'  -  in  the  sense  of
    'belonging' to Singapore. Indeed it is to be noted that after attending
    a short course in the UK in early 2009 he left for Dubai to reside with
    his parents for about 2� years until returning to the UK  in  September
    2011 as a Tier 4 student  migrant.  The  Appellant  has  not  lived  in
    Singapore since 2008 - leaving shortly after acquiring citizenship.


25.  Whilst this 'nationality profile' is not in any way  determinative,  in
    my judgement it is nonetheless a  reasonably  significant  factor  that
    adds weight favourable to the Appellant in the overall  proportionality
    balance. The Appellant is to some extent rootless, and as  such  it  is
    perhaps not surprising that he feels a  particular  bond  and  affinity
    with the UK where he has not only enjoyed the opportunity  of  pursuing
    his vocational studies, but has been able to form friendships with like-
    minded persons at the same time as exploring for  the  first  time  his
    independence. It is also to be noted that although  the  Appellant  was
    educated in Singapore he attended schools with  a  British  curriculum,
    learned English from a young age, and sat exams set by  UK  examination
    boards. In  any  event,  the  Appellant  effectively  finds  himself  a
    national of a country that is unable to support him in  his  vocational
    endeavour.


26.  In all such circumstances I have little  hesitation  in  answering  the
    first two Razgar questions in the Appellant's favour. There is no issue
    between  the  parties  in  respect  of  the  third  and  fourth  Razgar
    questions.


27.  In respect of the fifth Razgar question - proportionality - I have  had
    regard to Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.
    I approach the 'public interest considerations' under section  117B  on
    the basis that no particular consideration is determinative,  and  that
    the listed considerations are not exhaustive of the factors that may be
    relevant in any particular case. Pursuant to section 117B(1) I take  as
    a starting point that the maintenance of effective immigration  control
    is in the public  interest  -  and  in  particular  by  the  consistent
    application of a published set of Rules.


28.  The Appellant is able to speak English (section  117B(2));  given  also
    that he has had an education that is essentially English in nature, and
    is steeped in the cultural heritage of English  theatre,  there  is  no
    obstacle to integration. Indeed the supporting letters indicate a  very
    high level of integration has already been achieved.


29.  There does not appear to have been any issue raised in respect  of  the
    Appellant's financial independence. Whilst studying in the  UK  he  has
    been supported primarily by his parents with remittances from  Dubai  -
    though he has also worked part-time in the UK. His mother attended  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal and gave evidence in support  of
    the appeal; she was found to be an entirely  credible  witness.  It  is
    part of her evidence - and the  written  evidence  of  the  Appellant's
    father - that they are prepared to continue to  support  him,  and  are
    financially able to provide  additional  funding  over  and  above  the
    regular monthly remittances in the event of any particular  need.  Both
    work in the construction industry in  senior  positions  in  Dubai  and
    there is on file supporting evidence of their financial  circumstances.
    I am satisfied that the Appellant is financially  independent  (section
    117B(3)).


30.  The private life that the Appellant has established has been at a  time
    when he has been present in the UK lawfully, but precariously  (section
    117B(4)(5)).


31.  In my judgement the public interest is outweighed on the facts of  this
    particular case by the extent and gravity of the interference with  the
    Appellant's private life in the event that he is required to leave  the
    UK. It should be understood that this is not  a  finding  that  anybody
    wishing to pursue a career in theatre, or otherwise as an actor, should
    be able to resist removal. This case  is  determined  on  its  specific
    facts  by  reference  to:  the  very  particular  significance  to  the
    Appellant of his wish to pursue a career in acting; in combination with
    the very unusual circumstance of the limited nature of association with
    his country of origin including that it does not provide  a  meaningful
    opportunity to him to  give  expression  to  the  calling  that  is  an
    integral part of his identity; and supported by extensive  evidence  in
    respect of his potential  professional  capabilities,  and  -  of  less
    though still positive significance - his social circle.


32.  I conclude that the Appellant's removal from the UK in  consequence  of
    the  Respondent's  decision   would   constitute   a   disproportionate
    interference  with  his  Article  8  rights.  The  appeal  is   allowed
    accordingly.


Notice of Decision

33.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law and is set aside.


34.  I remake the decision in the appeal. The appeal is allowed.


35.  No anonymity order is sought or made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  I  have
considered making a fee award. I have decided to make a whole fee  award  of
�140: the Appellant's application was meritorious and he  has  appropriately
pursued his appeal to a favourable conclusion.

(Although I have determined the substance of the appeal in my capacity as  a
Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge, I make the Fee Award in my capacity as a First-
tier Tribunal Judge.)
