Representation:

For the Respondent:    Miss F Shaw, counsel, instructed by Adam Bernard
Solicitors
For the Appellant:     Mr Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is a material error of law in the decision of Designated Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal J M Lewis ("the DJ") promulgated on 16 November
    2015, in which he allowed the appellants' appeals against the  refusals
    of further leave to remain in the UK.


 2. Notwithstanding it is the Secretary of State who pursues this appeal, I
    refer to the parties as they were in the  First-tier  Tribunal,  namely
    with the Secretary of State at the respondent, for ease of reference.


 3. No anonymity direction was made in the First-tier Tribunal but  I  make
    an anonymity order now.

Background

 4. The appellants are husband and wife and citizens of Pakistan. The first
    appellant sought leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
    under the points based scheme.  The second appellant is his  dependant;
    the outcome of her appeal depended on that of her husband.


 5. The first appellant's application was refused by reference to paragraph
    245DD on various grounds including concerns about  the  genuineness  of
    the business, the first appellant's  intentions  with  regard  to  that
    business and the availability of funds.  The  appellants  appealed  and
    the DJ found that  the  claimed  funds  were  available  to  the  first
    appellant and that the business was  a  genuine  one.  He  allowed  the
    appeals.

 6. Permission to appeal was sought by the Secretary of State  and  granted
    in the following terms:


         "It is arguable, as asserted in the grounds, that the  Judge  erred
         in finding the financial requirements met on the  evidence  and  in
         light of the Secretary of state's power contained in paragraph  245
         DD(j)  allowing  the  Secretary  of  State  to  require  additional
         evidence and to refuse the application if it  is  not  forthcoming.
         It is also arguable that the Judge erred in taking into account the
         oral  evidence  of  the  Appellant  which  is  precluded  by  s.85A
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.".

 7. Hence the matter comes before me.

Submissions

 8. Mr Avery submitted,  for  the  respondent,  that  the  DJ  had  made  a
    fundamental mistake in his approach; it had  not  been  a  question  of
    whether or not the first appellant had  provided  the  respondent  with
    evidence  initially  but  whether  he  continued  to  have  the   funds
    available.  Mr  Avery  submitted  that  the  first  appellant  had  not
    provided the evidence requested.  This  was  one  of  the  reasons  the
    application had been refused. The DJ had failed to engage with that.

 9. Mr Avery submitted that the DJ had not made it clear what evidence  had
    been admissible and what was not.  Oral evidence had been given but was
    not admissible per Ahmed & Or (PBS: admissible  evidence)  [2014]  UKUT
    00365 (IAC).  The issues in Ahmed were not dissimilar to  those  before
    the DJ: an assessment of the genuineness and viability of the  business
    was required. He referred me to paragraphs 2 and 5 in particular.  Only
    the evidence before the respondent should have been considered. Oral or
    documentary evidence which was not before the  respondent  should  have
    been ignored. It was, in any event, unclear what the DJ had taken  into
    account, irrespective of the admissibility issues.

10. Miss Shaw submitted that it had  not  been  necessary  for  the  DJ  to
    identify  all  the  evidence  before  him.  The  respondent   had   not
    "specifically challenged" the appellant's oral evidence at the hearing;
    oral evidence had been  given  to  clarify/challenge  the  grounds  for
    refusal.  To that extent,  the  oral  evidence  and  first  appellant's
    witness statement were admissible. Otherwise there would be no  purpose
    to  the  appeal  hearing.   She  accepted,  nonetheless,   that   post-
    application evidence was not  admissible.  That  could,  she  said,  be
    distinguished from the first appellant's oral evidence.


11. Miss Shaw submitted  the  DJ  had  recognised  he  was  precluded  from
    considering post-application evidence: paragraphs 3, 12 and 15.  The DJ
    had noted that the first appellant had provided  bank  statements  with
    his application (paragraph 10); this  reflected  the  application  form
    content.  The DJ found that the statements  must  have  been  submitted
    because the refusal  letter  made  no  reference  to  their  not  being
    submitted (paragraph 13).  Furthermore, the first appellant had said at
    the hearing that the bank statements had been submitted (paragraph  8).
    That reflected the interview evidence given on 13 January  2015,  prior
    to the date of decision, that the first appellant had  invested  funds.
    That was not new evidence.  The DJ was entitled to rely  on  the  first
    appellant's interview evidence that the "rest are in account" (question
    33 in interview).

12. With regard to paragraph 245DD(j), both parties' representatives agreed
    that this  provided  at  the  date  of  decision,  that  the  requested
    documents must be received by the respondent within 28 working days  of
    the date of the request.  The respondent wrote to the  first  appellant
    on 5 February 2015 stating that  the  documents  must  be  sent  by  12
    February 2015; that gave the first appellant only five working days  to
    provide the additional documents when the rule provided that he  should
    be given 28 working days.

Discussion

13. This appeal is pursued by the Secretary of State on three grounds and I
    take each in turn.


14. The respondent claims that, at paragraph 13, the DJ "makes the  finding
    that "I conclude on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant did
    submit with his application...." It is submitted that it is  not  clear
    from the decision what evidence was before the respondent and how  this
    evidence established that the appellant had demonstrate  he  still  had
    the �25,000 available.  It is argued that there is inadequate reasoning
    on the issue.

15. The DJ finds that "the decision does not assert that the Appellant  did
    not submit financial evidence with his  application.  It  asserts  only
    that evidence had not been received from him to  demonstrate  that  his
    share of the funds had remained available to the company since the time
    of the application. The application refers to  bank  statements  having
    been submitted. Had they not been, it is not on balance  probable  that
    the appellant would have been granted the requisite points award in the
    category of maintenance (funds)." That finding is not challenged by the
    respondent before me.  Nor could the respondent challenge  the  finding
    that "I conclude on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant did
    submit with his application evidence that the �25,000  attributable  to
    him was available to the company ...".  The respondent's issue is  with
    the remainder of that sentence: "... and  that,  by  the  date  of  the
    decision, part of that money had been invested and the balance remained
    available".  The DJ refers in paragraph 11 of his decision to  evidence
    given by the first appellant in interview that "part of the monies  had
    been spent and rest were in the account (questions 29 to 34)".  The  DJ
    also refers in paragraph 8 to oral evidence of the first appellant that
    funds had been invested by the time the respondent wrote to him  asking
    him to provide personal bank statements  covering  the  previous  three
    months to demonstrate that funds had remained available to his company.
     The DJ noted that, according to his record (questions 2-4), the  first
    appellant had said he had invested about �17,500.   I  agree  with  the
    respondent that the oral evidence  on  the  availability  of  funds  is
    inadmissible, being in contravention of s85A. However,  this  error  of
    law is not material because the  DJ  also  based  his  finding  on  the
    evidence  of  the  first  appellant  in  interview  and  that  was   an
    appropriate finding.


16. Whilst the DJ does not specifically deal with the impact  of  paragraph
    245DD(j), I note the representatives  now  agree  that  the  respondent
    should, according to the version of that paragraph in force at the date
    of decision, have given the first appellant 28 working days in which to
    respond to the respondent's request for  evidence  to  demonstrate  his
    share of the funds remained available to the company since the date  of
    application.   Given  the  respondent  had  not  complied   with   that
    timeframe, it was inappropriate for her to draw an  adverse  conclusion
    as to the availability of funds.  However, that is not an  issue  which
    was addressed by  the  DJ  and  he  found  nonetheless,  in  the  first
    appellant's favour, that the funds remained available. For the  reasons
    I have identified there is no material error of law in that finding.

17. The second ground of appeal relates to paragraph  15.   It  is  claimed
    that the DJ's reasons are inadequate for  finding  that  "some  of  the
    documents are admissible and some not. He does not  ...  explain  which
    documents are admissible, why they are admissible  and  what  they  add
    tothe  [sic]  appeal".    Ms   Shaw   submitted   that   the   parties'
    representatives had, before the DJ, agreed which  documentary  evidence
    was admissible and which was not.  However, this is not  noted  in  the
    decision.  Nor is the documentary evidence produced by  the  appellant,
    either to the respondent or at the hearing, specifically identified  in
    the DJ's decision.  On the other hand, there is  no  reference  in  the
    decision to the parties being in dispute as to  those  documents  which
    were admissible and those which were not and this  is  consistent  with
    Miss Shaw's submission to me.  Mr Avery was unable to comment  on  this
    because the Home Office Presenting Officer (HOPO) had made no  note  of
    any such discussion or agreement; nonetheless he did not  dispute  such
    an agreement might have been reached.   Given  Ms  Shaw's  submissions,
    which are not challenged by Mr Avery, I am unable to find that  the  DJ
    should have given reasons  for  finding  that  certain  documents  were
    admissible or otherwise. The DJ made it clear that  he  recognised  the
    impact of s85A and that he had borne in mind the issue of admissibility
    throughout his decision-making.

18. The third ground of appeal to this tribunal also relates  to  paragraph
    15.  It is claimed that s85A of the 2002 Act precludes consideration of
    the first appellant's oral evidence given at the hearing.  According to
    his decision, the DJ  took  into  account  not  only  that  documentary
    evidence which he considered admissible but also the first  appellant's
    oral evidence.  The oral evidence has not been set out in the  decision
    and the reader is unable therefore to identify it or  those  issues  to
    which it relates.  It  is  said  in  the  decision  that  it  was  "not
    specifically challenged. It  is  essentially  consistent,  and  derives
    support from a  significant  quantity  of  documentary  evidence.   The
    Appellant appeared to me to  be  a  witness  of  truth.  I  accept  his
    evidence, and refer to it as far  as  necessary.".   It  is  not  clear
    whether, in making that  assessment  the  DJ  was  assessing  the  oral
    evidence against only the admissible documentary  evidence  or  against
    all the documentary evidence.

19. The DJ notes the reasons the respondent did not accept the business was
    genuine. He then goes on to state:

         "15. The appellant has submitted substantial documentary  evidence.
         For the reason stated, some is admissible and some is not.  At  the
         hearing he gave evidence on these matters. It is sufficient for  me
         to conclude, from  the  totality  of  his  oral  evidence  and  the
         admissible documentary evidence, that I accept the  genuineness  of
         each of the  contracts  and  of  the  advertising  and  accept  the
         explanations of the appellant in relation  to  these  matters,  the
         company website,  its  insurance  and  the  appellant's  education,
         qualifications and business experience.  Assessing  the  admissible
         evidence as a whole, I find on the balance  of  probabilities  that
         the business is a genuine one and that the Appellant was a  genuine
         entrepreneur. ..."


20. Thus the DJ's decision that the business was genuine was based  on  the
    "totality of his oral evidence" as well as the "admissible  documentary
    evidence". By inference, the DJ had not considered whether or  not  the
    first appellant's oral evidence was admissible under s85A.  The DJ went
    on to accept "the explanations" of the first appellant with  regard  to
    the concerns of the respondent.  There is no indication in the decision
    as to the nature of those explanations and the respondent  is  entitled
    to know the basis on which the DJ found that the business was a genuine
    one and to know that the DJ had not taken into account  evidence  which
    was not before the decision-maker (Ahmed). That is not clear  from  the
    decision.  The DJ  goes  on  to  say  that  "assessing  the  admissible
    evidence as a whole I find on the balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    business was a genuine one ...".  Thus in this sentence he has referred
    to making his decision on  the  basis  of  admissible  evidence  alone,
    whereas earlier in the paragraph he refers to relying on "the  totality
    of his oral evidence and  the  admissible  documentary  evidence"  when
    making his finding as to the genuineness of the business.  I  can  only
    infer that the DJ concluded that all the oral evidence was  admissible.
    However, in paragraph 8 the DJ cited a figure for investment, given  in
    oral evidence, which was higher than that given in interview. This  was
    new evidence and inadmissible. On this basis, I find that, at least  to
    some extent, the oral evidence of  the  first  appellant  included  new
    material.  It follows therefore  that  the  DJ  made  his  findings  in
    paragraph 15  partly  on  the  basis  of  new  material  in  the  first
    appellant's oral evidence.  This had a bearing on the  outcome  of  the
    appeal and  is  therefore  a  material  error  of  law.   I  set  aside
    paragraphs 15 and 16 of his decision.

21. Mr Avery submitted that, in this event, I should remake  the  decision.
    Miss Shaw's primary submission was that the matter should  be  remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal because it was  "fiddly"  but  she  accepted
    that it may be more appropriate for me to remake the  decision  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  She said there was no need for the first appellant  to
    give oral evidence for the decision to be remade.

22. I therefore remake the decision with regard to the genuineness  of  the
    first appellant's business. In doing so, I take into account  the  DJ's
    findings with regard to the availability of funds and his acceptance of
    the first appellant's evidence in interview that he had invested  funds
    in the business.

23. I  disregard  the  failure  of  the  appellant  to  provide  additional
    documents with regard to the availability of funds in response  to  the
    respondent's letter to him of  5  February  2015.  The  representatives
    agree that the version of paragraph  245DD(j)  in  force  at  the  time
    provided that the respondent should have given the appellant 28 working
    days to respond to the  request.  The  respondent  gave  him  until  12
    February 2015, a considerably shorter period.  The decision  to  refuse
    the application was taken before the expiry of the period  required  in
    paragraph 245DD(j).

24. I make the following findings with regard to  the  genuineness  of  the
    business.  According to  the  Company  Register  Information  form  the
    company was incorporated on  17  January  2014.   The  two  consultancy
    agreements with Care Link UK Trust and Southwest Surplus Tools are each
    dated only three days later: 20 January 2014. The application which  is
    the subject of this appeal is dated 22  January  2014,  only  two  days
    after those agreements were signed.  The  first  appellant's  leave  to
    remain was due to expire about two weeks later. The mere fact that  the
    business was created relatively shortly before the expiry of his  leave
    to remain does not of itself  indicate  that  the  business  is  not  a
    genuine one but it  suggests  that  the  creation  of  the  documentary
    evidence was not unconnected with the  imminent  expiry  of  the  first
    appellant's leave to remain. I consider it in the round.

25. The respondent does not dispute the existence of Care Link UK Trust and
    acknowledges it is registered with the Charities Commission.  The  fact
    the agreement with Care Link UK Trust has not been signed by  a  person
    who is identified on that organisation's  website  as  an  officeholder
    does not render the agreement invalid.

26. The first appellant's evidence in interview in January 2015 is that his
    company "held some marriage ceremonies for people" and that the biggest
    event arranged so far (at the date of interview) was a "wedding event".
     However, the first appellant also said in interview that they had  not
    taken out any insurance at that time. He acknowledged that professional
    indemnity insurance was needed and that it was  "under  way".  He  said
    that, as they did not have premises yet, they did not  need  "liability
    or insurance".  Thus the evidence of the first appellant  in  interview
    is, on the face of it, contradictory.   Furthermore, it  is  remarkable
    that the first appellant, on the one hand, acknowledged the  importance
    of insurance cover yet had contracted  to  arrange  a  "wedding  event"
    without it.  I consider a person who  is  running  a  genuine  business
    would not take the risk of providing a service such as the planning and
    provision of third party catering without such insurance in place.   In
    interview the first appellant said the company had received �1,800  for
    that wedding event and that their income to date was about �8,000.   It
    is not credible that the first appellant  would  embark  on  a  genuine
    business without putting insurance cover in place,  particularly  given
    the level of income received to date and  the  public  liability  risks
    arising from the provision of such services.  It is also relevant that,
    by this stage,  funds  had  been  invested  in  the  company  and  were
    available for the purchase of insurance cover.


27. I have similar concerns about the  lack  of  insurance  cover  for  the
    product launch event for Southwest Surplus Tools which  was  contracted
    to be held on 12 February 2014.  I find it incredible that  the  owners
    of a genuine business would not, by the date of  interview  in  January
    2015, have purchased insurance cover for  a  business  which  had  been
    operating for over a year.


28. I agree with  the  respondent  that  the  nature  of  the  business  as
    described by the first appellant in interview is at odds with the  aims
    and objectives of Care  Link  UK  Trust,  including  reducing  domestic
    abuse.  The organisation of wedding events is not, on the face  of  it,
    consistent  with  that  organisation's  aims.   The  first  appellant's
    answers to questions in interview about the company's  engagement  with
    Care Link UK are also vague and lacking in detail.

29. Given that the business had been up and running for about a year by the
    date of interview, I would expect the first appellant to have been in a
    position to provide considerable detail in  that  interview  about  the
    activities and operations of the company in the previous year.  Instead
    his answers are vague, hesitant and lacking in detail.  He should  have
    been in a  position  to  provide  considerable  information  about  the
    running of the business, the business objectives and other aspects. For
    example, although he mentioned  issuing  questionnaires  in  connection
    with market research, he failed to explain the outcome of that research
    and how it impacted on their management of the business. He  said  only
    "from that data we based  our  business".   By  that  time,  the  first
    appellant and his business partner had had sufficient time  to  analyse
    the outcome of their  market  research  and  to  formulate  a  business
    strategy accordingly.

30. The respondent has noted that although the first appellant  claimed  in
    interview to organise wedding events, there was no mention of this type
    of event in his advertising material on free websites  such  as  Scoot,
    TouchLocal,  The  Sun  directory  and  The  Independent  directory;  if
    anything, the business targeted other businesses as customers. This  is
    a significant inconsistency as regards the business' client base.

31. There are further inconsistencies in the evidence given in interview by
    the first appellant and his business partner. For  example,  the  first
    appellant  referred   to   having   had   about   8-10   responses   to
    advertisements, whereas his  business  partner,  when  asked  the  same
    question, said he could not remember.   Given  the  limited  number  of
    responses claimed by the first appellant, I would expect his partner to
    be able to comment on the level of response, even if he were  not  able
    to recall a number.

32. The interview provided the first  appellant  with  the  opportunity  to
    address fully any anomalies arising from his application, yet he failed
    to do so.  If  anything,  his  evidence  in  interview  raised  further
    concerns. This was despite the fact that, by  then,  the  business  had
    allegedly been operating for nearly a year.

33. Taking the first appellant's evidence as  a  whole,  I  find  that  the
    respondent's decision is not in breach of  paragraph  245DD(h),  taking
    into  account  the  factors  at  paragraph  245(i),  particularly   the
    viability and credibility of the applicant's business plans and  market
    research into their chosen business sector (sub-paragraph (iii)).

34. The second appellant's  appeal  is  dependent  on  that  of  the  first
    appellant. It follows that the respondent's decision on her appeal  was
    not in breach of the Rules either.

Decision

35. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  a
    material error of law, as set out above.


36. I set aside the DJ's findings at paragraphs 15 and 16 of his  decision.



37. I remake the  DJ's  decision  by  dismissing  both  appeals  under  the
    Immigration Rules.
