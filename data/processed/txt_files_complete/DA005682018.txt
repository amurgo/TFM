Practitioners & Co Ltd


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the Respondent as the Appellant as he was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Lithuania. His date of birth  is  6  June
    1966.  The Appellant came to the UK on 1 January 2014 with his wife and
    daughter.  On 14 September 2014 the Appellant committed an  offence  of
    theft (shoplifting) for which he was, on 28 July 2016 ordered to pay  a
    fine.  Between 5 December 2015 and 21 August 2016 he committed 25 fraud
    offences. He was convicted of these offences on 22 August 2016.  He was
    sentenced to imprisonment of 24 weeks  suspended  for  24  months.   In
    addition, he was ordered to pay compensation of ï¿½987.35.  On  26  March
    2018 he was convicted of  nineteen  fraud  offences  and  breach  of  a
    suspended sentence.  The fraud offences were committed between 12  June
    2017 and 25 August 2017.  On 27 August 2018 he  was  sentenced  by  the
    Crown Court to 32 weeks' imprisonment on each count to run concurrently
    and 24 months for breach of a suspended sentence which was  reduced  to
    twelve weeks' imprisonment. In total he  was  sentenced  to  44  weeks'
    imprisonment.

 3. The Secretary of State made an order pursuant to Regulation 23(6)(b) of
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016  ("the  2016
    Regulations") to deport the Appellant.  The Appellant appealed  against
    that decision.   The  Appellant's  appeal  was  allowed  by  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Kainth.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Saffer   granted
    permission on 14 June 2019 to the Secretary of State, having  concluded
    that it was arguable that the judge had  not  adequately  assessed  the
    adverse impact on society of the Appellant's criminality and  may  have
    erred regarding the extent to which a fundamental interest  of  society
    being protected from a prolific offender  was  engaged.   He  concluded
    that all grounds may be argued.

The decision of the FTT

 4. The parties agreed at the hearing that the Appellant  was  entitled  to
    the basic level of protection under the 2016 Regulations.  He had  been
    here since January  2014,  however,  taking  into  account  periods  of
    imprisonment he was not entitled to permanent residence.

 5. The judge heard evidence from the  Appellant,  his  wife  (Mrs  Zinalda
    Satkiene) and their adult daughter (Miss Zydrune Satkiene).  The  judge
    recorded the Appellant's evidence at [22] as follows:

         "22. He apologised with regards  to  his  offending  behaviour  and
             explained that it took place during a very turbulent  time  in
             his personal life.  His employer had become bankrupt, his wife
             had lost her  job  and  his  daughter  who  was  pregnant  had
             separated from her partner.  He had learnt a  valuable  lesson
             during  his  period  of  incarceration  in  prison.   He   was
             assaulted on two separate occasions sustaining  a  broken  jaw
             for which he still  receives  treatment.   He  disputed  under
             cross-examination that he actually fallen out of the top  bunk
             which resulted in the injury sustained  as  opposed  to  being
             assaulted by a fellow inmate.  He did not recall  an  incident
             as recorded within the prison log that on 11th  June  2018  he
             was involved in an altercation and a prison officer had  noted
             that the appellant had cuts to his finger and knuckles".

 6. He recorded the Appellant's wife's evidence at [23] as follows:

         "23. His wife adopted her witness statement taken  at  court.   She
             was asked no supplementary  questions  and  was  tendered  for
             cross-examination.  In summary her evidence was that  she  was
             not aware of her husband's offending.  That he is an  integral
             part of the family unit and provides  support  to  her,  their
             younger daughter and their two older children.  They no longer
             have property in  Lithuania.   She  repeated  the  appellant's
             explanation with respect to the  difficulties  that  they  had
             experienced as a family unit when the offending took place".

 7. The judge found that the Appellant and the witnesses were credible  and
    said as follows at [27]:

         "27. There was no dispute that the appellant was in a  genuine  and
             subsisting relationship with his wife and adult  children.   I
             found the appellant and his witnesses to be  credible  in  the
             evidence they provided in their witness statements and orally.
              In carrying out the balancing exercise required, I must  take
             account of the fundamental rights at stake, in particular  the
             right to respect for private and family life and  ensure  that
             the principle of proportionality is observed.   The  principal
             concept of  public  policy  and  public  security  provides  a
             legitimate aim which can justify an  interference  with  those
             fundamental rights.  For example, the fight against  crime  in
             connection with drug trafficking as part of an organised group
             will be included within the concept of public security as will
             the fight against  terrorism.   Expulsion  decisions  must  be
             found on the existence of a genuine, present and  sufficiently
             serious threat to the requirements of public policy or  public
             security, in view of the criminal offences  committed  by  the
             appellant".

 8. The judge directed himself in relation to the law and the  Respondent's
    guidance at [28] and [29]:

         "28. In R v Bouchereau 1978 QB 732 (ECJ) 760 it was said  that  the
             presence or conduct of  the  individual  should  constitute  a
             genuine and sufficiently serious threat to public policy.   In
             SSHD v Straszewski and SSHD v Kersys [2015] EWCA Civ 1245, the
             Court of Appeal noted that  Regulation  21(5)  provided  their
             decision to remove an EEA national with a permanent  right  of
             residence must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of
             the person concerned and matters that did not directly  relate
             to the particular case or which related to  considerations  of
             general prevention did not justify a  removal  decision.   The
             Court  of  Appeal  also  noted  in  R  v  Bouchereau  that  in
             exceptional cases, where the personal conduct of an alien  had
             caused deep  public  revulsion,  public  policy  required  his
             removal.   This  was  an  element  of   pragmatism   and   the
             recognition of the right to deport those who had committed the
             most heinous of crimes, which was at odds with the  principles
             of the Citizens' Directive.

         29.  The respondent's own guidance with respect  to  EEA  decisions
             taken on grounds of public policy reads;

                  'Present - the threat must exist but it does not  need  to
                  be imminent.   An  indication  of  a  present  threat  may
                  include intelligence or any other  precautionary  measures
                  which have been imposed on the individual  for  example  a
                  licence condition imposed because there is a  genuine  and
                  present risk.  Even a low risk can  constitute  a  present
                  threat, especially where the consequences of  any  offence
                  could be serious.  An argument by the individual that they
                  pose a low risk of  offending  should  not  be  determined
                  automatically in their favour when making a public  policy
                  decision.  For the purpose of determining whether a person
                  is a present threat while they are detained, the fact that
                  they are detained should not be taken into  account.   The
                  threat does not need  to  be  imminent  at  the  point  of
                  release'".

 9. At [37] he further directed himself:

         "37. As I have already indicated, despite the appellant having been
             sentenced  before  the  Magistrates'  Court  to  a   suspended
             sentence and the Crown Court, I would  have  expected  a  pre-
             sentence report to have been prepared  for  at  least  one  of
             those hearings more  likely  the  former  as  opposed  to  the
             latter.  Because the appellant received a  custodial  term  of
             under twelve months, he  would  have  been  subject  to  post-
             licence conditions for a period of twelve months as issued  by
             the Probation Services.  It was  not  suggested  that  he  had
             breached such conditions".

10. The judge acknowledged that the Appellant had previous convictions  for
    dishonesty.  The judge set out the  sentencing  remarks  of  the  Crown
    Court Judge at [31] of his decision as follows:

         "On 26th March you were sent to this court to be  sentenced  for  a
         catalogue of nineteen fraud by false representation charges  and  a
         breach of a suspended sentence order.  On  23rd  good  police  work
         took them to the Asda fuel station in Gillingham... You were  found
         with a vehicle and a pump - or the noise of a pump was heard.  You,
         claimed not to be able to get access to the back of the vehicle but
         the police got into the back of the vehicle and discovered a  1,000
         litre tank inside with 800 litres of  fuel.   This  tank  had  been
         filled via the filler neck leading from the outside of the  vehicle
         and the vehicle was fitted with  stolen  number  plates...  Between
         12th June 2017 and 24th August 2017 you had committed no fewer than
         nineteen offences of fraud by obtaining  fuel  using  foreign  bank
         cards which were not honoured by the relevant banks.  You used  two
         vehicles to carry out this fraud, the overall loss was ï¿½757.

         This was quite a sophisticated  fraud  with  multiple  offences  on
         several occasions... Regrettably, it was  not  your  first  venture
         into criminal activity.  On 22nd August 2016 you had been convicted
         of no less than 25 similar offences, using  the  same  scheme,  the
         same technique to obtain fuel from Asda in  Stevenage  between  5th
         December 2015  and  21st  August  2016.   For  those  offences  you
         received what I would consider  a  lenient  sentence,  a  suspended
         sentence order for 24 weeks suspended for two years  and  you  were
         ordered to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work.   I  give  you  some
         small credit for completing the hours of  unpaid  work  but  it  is
         clear that you took  no  notice  of  the  terms  of  the  suspended
         sentence..."

11. The judge set out the Respondent's case at [32].  The Respondent's case
    was that the Appellant offended during a suspended sentence and had not
    taken heed of the original sentence which was imposed as  a  deterrent.
    Furthermore, it was asserted that the Appellant had not undertaken  the
    necessary rehabilitation to  reduce  offending  and  that  he  was  not
    genuinely remorseful.  It was asserted that his convictions established
    a pattern of repeated offending within a  relatively  short  period  of
    time and that there was a propensity to commit  like  offences  in  the
    future.

12. The judge set out his findings at [33] to [45].  He said  that  he  was
    not provided with a pre-sentence report and was not aware one  existed.
    He did not have a copy of any post-licence  conditions  that  may  have
    been imposed.  The judge stated that the Appellant's entire family  are
    in the UK and settled, that he  has  regular  contact  with  his  adult
    children and grandchildren for whom  he  has  caring  responsibilities.
    The judge recorded that prior to coming to the UK  the  Appellant  sold
    what assets he had in order to start a new life here.

13. The judge made the following findings:

         "34. The respondent takes the view that in light of the appellant's
             criminality and the risk that he may commit  further  offences
             in the UK, the decision  to  deport  him  is  a  proportionate
             measure and that his presence in the  United  Kingdom  is  not
             conducive to the public good.  At first  blush,  that  may  be
             correct, but it does not take into account that the 240  hours
             of unpaid work that were imposed by the Magistrates' Court  in
             August 2016 had all been completed before the appellant  found
             himself in violation of the suspended custodial term.   In  my
             assessment, that indicates that the appellant was aware of the
             consequences of finding  himself  in  breach  and  accordingly
             undertook the  community  aspect  of  the  suspended  sentence
             requirement.   It  clearly  does  not  demonstrate   that   he
             continued to offend in a like nature.

         ...

         37.  As I have already indicated, despite the appellant having been
             sentenced  before  the  Magistrates'  Court  to  a   suspended
             sentence and the Crown Court, I would  have  expected  a  pre-
             sentence report to have been prepared  for  at  least  one  of
             those hearings more  likely  the  former  as  opposed  to  the
             latter.  Because the appellant received a  custodial  term  of
             under twelve months, he  would  have  been  subject  to  post-
             licence conditions for a period of twelve months as issued  by
             the Probation Services.  It was  not  suggested  that  he  had
             breached such conditions.

         38.  I note that the loss in financial terms equated to  ï¿½757.   Ms
             Tobin at paragraph 12 of  her  skeleton  argument  highlighted
             that the  Crown  Court  Judge  when  applying  the  sentencing
             counsel's guidelines placed the appellant's offending  in  the
             lowest category because the loss caused by the  appellant  was
             low.  The appellant received maximum credit by way of sentence
             reduction in light of his early  guilty  plea  (committal  for
             sentence).  The appellant continues to play a  committed  role
             within his close-knit family  unit.   He  has  re-entered  the
             workforce and in his oral evidence came  across  as  extremely
             apologetic and remorseful.

         39.  Because the sentence was a term not exceeding  twelve  months,
             the practise is that the appellant would not  be  eligible  to
             undertake any type of rehabilitation programme in prison.  The
             respondent's assertion and the absence of the  same  indicates
             that the appellant continues to have a  propensity  to  commit
             like offences is misconceived.

         40.  The appellant's previous convictions in themselves are  not  a
             sufficient basis for his deportation.  There must be a risk of
             re-offending and in light of the appellant's evidence which  I
             find credible, I accept that he  has  learnt  a  valuable  and
             solitary lesson and is now shameful for his past  criminality.



         ...

         42.  Even if I am wrong with respect to that assessment, under  the
             umbrella of proportionality, there was  no  dispute  that  the
             appellant's younger daughter suffers from  gross  motor  delay
             which continues to have an impact on her and  she  is  heavily
             dependent upon both her parents for  support.   The  appellant
             continues  to  have  an  active  role  with  respect  to   his
             grandchildren.  None of this evidence was challenged."

14. The relevant law is contained in Regulation 27 and Schedule  1  of  the
    2016 Regulations

                      is in the best interests of the person concerned,  as
                      provided for in the Convention on the Rights  of  the
                      Child adopted by the General Assembly of  the  United

                      genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
                      affecting  one  of  the  fundamental   interests   of
                      society, taking into  account  past  conduct  of  the
                      person and that  the  threat  does  not  need  to  be
                      imminent;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                      which relate to considerations of general  prevention
                      do not justify the decision;

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                      themselves justify the decision;

                  (f)  the decision may be taken  on  preventative  grounds,
                      even  in  the  absence   of   a   previous   criminal
                      conviction, provided the grounds are specific to  the
                      person.

             (6)  Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
                  public policy and public security in relation to a  person
                  ("P") who is resident in the United Kingdom, the  decision
                  maker must take account of considerations such as the age,
                  state of health, family and economic situation of  P,  P's
                  length of residence in the United Kingdom, P's social  and
                  cultural integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
                  extent of P's links with P's country of origin.

             (7)  In the case of a relevant decision taken  on  grounds  of
                  public health-

                  (a)  a disease that does not have  epidemic  potential  as
                      defined by the  relevant  instruments  of  the  World
                      Health Organisation or is not  a  disease  listed  in
                      Schedule 1 to the  Health  Protection  (Notification)
                      Regulations 2010(2); or

                  (b)  if the person concerned is in the United Kingdom, any
                      disease  occurring  after  the  three  month   period
                      beginning on the date on which the person arrived  in
                      the United Kingdom,

                  does not constitute grounds for the decision.

             (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether the  requirements
                  of this regulation  are  met  must  (in  particular)  have
                  regard to  the  considerations  contained  in  Schedule  1
                  (considerations of public policy, public security and  the
                  fundamental interests of society etc.).'

                                    -----

                                 'SCHEDULE 1

    CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, PUBLIC SECURITY AND THE FUNDAMENTAL
                          INTERESTS OF SOCIETY ETC.

         Considerations of public policy and public security

         1.   The EU Treaties do not impose a uniform scale of public policy
             or public security values: member  States  enjoy  considerable
             discretion,  acting  within  the  parameters  set  by  the  EU
             Treaties, applied where relevant  by  the  EEA  agreement,  to
             define  their  own  standards  of  public  policy  and  public
             security, for purposes tailored to their individual  contexts,
             from time to time.




         Application of paragraph 1 to the United Kingdom

         2.   An EEA national or the family member of an EEA national having
             extensive familial and societal links with persons of the same
             nationality or language does not amount to integration in  the
             United Kingdom; a significant degree  of  wider  cultural  and
             societal integration must be present before a  person  may  be
             regarded as integrated in the United Kingdom.

         3.   Where an EEA national or the family member of an EEA  national
             has  received  a  custodial  sentence,  or  is  a   persistent
             offender, the longer the sentence, or the  more  numerous  the
             convictions, the greater the likelihood that the  individual's
             continued presence in the United Kingdom represents a genuine,
             present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  of  the
             fundamental interests of society.

         4.   Little weight is to be attached to the integration of  an  EEA
             national or the family member of an EEA  national  within  the
             United Kingdom if the alleged integrating links were formed at
             or around the same time as-

             (a)  the commission of a criminal offence;

             (b)  an act otherwise affecting the fundamental  interests  of
                  society;

             (c)  the EEA national or family member of an EEA national  was
                  in custody.

         5.   The removal from the United Kingdom of an EEA national or  the
             family member of an  EEA  national  who  is  able  to  provide
             substantive  evidence  of  not  demonstrating  a  threat  (for
             example, through demonstrating that the EEA  national  or  the
             family member of an EEA national has successfully reformed  or
             rehabilitated) is less likely to be proportionate.

         6.   It is  consistent  with  public  policy  and  public  security
             requirements in the United Kingdom that EEA decisions  may  be
             taken in order to refuse,  terminate  or  withdraw  any  right
             otherwise conferred by these Regulations in the case of  abuse
             of rights or fraud, including-

             (a)  entering, attempting to enter or assisting another person
                  to enter  or  to  attempt  to  enter,  a  marriage,  civil
                  partnership or durable partnership of convenience; or

             (b)   fraudulently  obtaining  or  attempting  to  obtain,  or
                  assisting another to obtain or to  attempt  to  obtain,  a
                  right to reside under these Regulations.

         The fundamental interests of society

         7.    For  the  purposes  of  these  Regulations,  the  fundamental
             interests of society in the United Kingdom include-

             (a)   preventing  unlawful  immigration  and  abuse   of   the
                  immigration  laws,  and  maintaining  the  integrity   and
                  effectiveness of the immigration control system (including
                  under these Regulations) and of the Common Travel Area;

             (b)  maintaining public order;

             (c)  preventing social harm;

             (d)  preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;

             (e)  protecting public services;

             (f)  excluding or removing an EEA national or family member of
                  an EEA national with a  conviction  (including  where  the
                  conduct of that person is likely to cause, or has in  fact
                  caused, public offence) and maintaining public  confidence
                  in the ability of the relevant authorities  to  take  such
                  action;

             (g)  tackling offences likely to cause harm to  society  where
                  an immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify
                  but where there is wider societal harm (such  as  offences
                  related to the misuse of drugs  or  crime  with  a  cross-
                  border dimension as mentioned  in  Article  83(1)  of  the
                  Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union);

             (h)    combating   the   effects   of   persistent   offending
                  (particularly in relation to offences, which if  taken  in
                  isolation,  may  otherwise  be  unlikely   to   meet   the
                  requirements of regulation 27);

             (i)   protecting  the   rights   and   freedoms   of   others,
                  particularly from exploitation and trafficking;

             (j)  protecting the public;

             (k)  acting in the best interests of a child (including  where
                  doing so entails refusing a child admission to the  United
                  Kingdom, or otherwise taking an  EEA  decision  against  a
                  child);

             (l)  countering terrorism and extremism and protecting  shared
                  values.'

 Conclusions

15.  The  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  of  appeal  are   insufficiently
    particularised.  I was provided with  a  skeleton  argument  which  was
    served on 8 August 2019.  This effectively repeats the grounds. I heard
    oral submissions from both representatives.

16. The grounds comprise twelve paragraphs. Paragraphs 4 to 12,  under  the
    heading "making a material misdirection of  law/inadequate  reasoning,"
    assert that the judge made a number of errors.

17. I shall deal firstly with [4] and [5] of the grounds and the submission
    that the judge  has  not  properly  applied  the  law.  The  judge  was
    unarguably aware of the test that had to be applied to  this  Appellant
    within the relevant hierarchy of the Regulations.  I refer specifically
    to the decision of the  judge  at  [13],  [17]  and  [27].   The  judge
    concluded that the Appellant did not  present  such  a  threat,  having
    lawfully attached weight to his early guilty plea, the evidence of  the
    Appellant and witnesses who were found credible, the absence of a  pre-
    sentence report and  that  the  Appellant  completed  the  unpaid  work
    element of the suspended sentence.   The  judge  rationally  took  into
    account that despite having breached a suspended sentence, there was no
    suggestion that the  Appellant  had  breached  post-licence  conditions
    following his release from prison. In addition,  the  judge  rationally
    attached weight to the sentencing Counsel's guidelines which placed the
    offending in the lowest category (because the loss caused was low)  and
    that the Appellant received maximum credit because of his guilty  plea.



18. As properly observed by the judge there  is  limited  case  law  giving
    guidance  on  what  constitutes  serious  grounds  of  public   policy.
    However, the judge properly directed himself on  the  law.  Whilst  the
    cases he referred to, at [28], relate to the test applied to  different
    levels of within the hierarchy, the principles identified by the  judge
    applied equally  to  the  Appellant.   It  is,  in  any  event,  wholly
    unarguable that the judge assessed threat posed by the Appellant on the
    basis that he was entitled to a greater level of protection.

19. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the grounds assert that the judge did not make  a
    proper assessment of risk, that the decision is inadequately  reasoned,
    and credibility findings are flawed.  On any reading  of  the  decision
    the judge  unarguably  assessed  the  threat  and  risk  posed  by  the
    Appellant.  The grounds amount to a disagreement with that  assessment.
    The judge understood the Appellant's criminality and the extent of  it.
    He was wholly aware  that  he  had  repeated  offences  which  involved
    dishonesty and that he had breached a suspended sentence. He was  aware
    that the Appellant had deceived his family who was  not  aware  of  his
    criminality at the time of the offending.  All these matters were taken
    in to account.

20. The judge found that the Appellant was credible.   The  grounds  assert
    there is no adequate reasoning for this, particularly in the  light  of
    the Appellant's criminality involving dishonesty.  It is also  asserted
    that the sentencing remarks were not taken into account in  so  far  as
    they commented on  the  Appellant  having  deceived  his  family.   The
    grounds ignore that the judge heard evidence from  the  Appellant,  his
    wife and daughter (set out above).  Whilst there was a challenge to how
    the Appellant broke his jaw in custody, see [22], this is not a  matter
    raised in the grounds. The grounds do  not  assert  that  there  was  a
    challenge of material significance to the evidence of the Appellant and
    witnesses which was not resolved by the judge.

21. The judge accepted the Appellant's oral evidence  of  contrition  which
    was supported by the evidence of his wife.  The  judge  was  unarguably
    aware that the Appellant had not been straight with  his  family  about
    his criminality at the time of offending.  The judge had the benefit of
    hearing the Appellant and witnesses give evidence. He was  entitled  to
    accept it and to find at [38] that "his oral evidence  came  across  as
    extremely apologetic and remorseful."  The grounds do not  take  proper
    account of the  burden  of  proof.   Whilst  the  Appellant's  criminal
    conduct tells part of the story, it was incumbent on the judge to  make
    an overall assessment of risk, taking into account all the evidence.  I
    am satisfied that he did this.

22. A proper reading of [40] of  the  decision  discloses  that  the  judge
    assessed risk and found that the  Respondent  had  not  discharged  the
    burden of establishing that the conduct of the Appellant represented  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.  The ground that there was an absence
    of  a  proper  assessment  is  without  substance.  The  findings   are
    adequately reasoned.

23. At [8] of the grounds the issue of rehabilitation is  raised;  however,
    there is no proper identification of an error of law.  It  is  asserted
    that it has not been shown what, if any, attempts  have  been  made  at
    rehabilitation.  This is repeated at [13] of the skeleton argument with
    reference to [36] of the judge's decision.  At  [39]  of  the  decision
    the judge assumed that because the sentence of imprisonment  was  under
    twelve months, the Appellant would  not  be  eligible  to  undertake  a
    rehabilitation programme in prison.  It is  not  clear  the  source  of
    this; however, it is not challenged  in  the  grounds.  The  judge  was
    entitled to conclude that the absence of a rehabilitation programme  in
    prison was not material to his assessment of this Appellant.  There  is
    no legal requirement for the Appellant to complete  a  programme  or  a
    course in order to establish rehabilitation.   The judge was unarguably
    aware that the Appellant had breached a suspended sentence which led to
    a twelve- week sentence and which unarguably established that  when  he
    committed the second tranche of  offences  he  was  not  rehabilitated.
    Time had moved on and the judge had to assess the  Appellant's  conduct
    at the hearing before him which was after the Appellant had received  a
    custodial sentence for the  breach.   What  weight  to  attach  to  the
    evidence, that the Appellant had in fact completed the community aspect
    of a suspended sentence, in this case unpaid work, was a matter for the
    judge.  The judge was entitled to conclude at [40] that  the  Appellant
    "has learnt a valuable and solitary (sic) lesson and  is  now  shameful
    for his past criminality". The judge was unarguably entitled to proceed
    on the basis that the Appellant had not breached the conditions of  his
    licence in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

24. Paragraph 9 of the grounds assert that [34] of the decision is unclear.
    It also repeats that  the  judge  erred  in  attaching  weight  to  the
    Appellant having completed community service before re-offending, which
    according to the Respondent is an immaterial  matter  because  he  went
    onto reoffend.  Whilst I accept that the last two sentences of [34] are
    not entirely clear, as was accepted by Ms Tobin  in  oral  submissions,
    there is nothing unlawful in attaching weight to the  Appellant  having
    completed unpaid work when assessing the threat that he  presents.   It
    was a factor in favour of the Appellant notwithstanding  that  he  went
    onto re-offend. What weight to attach to the matter was for  the  judge
    to decide. In any event, it was not a finding which is determinative of
    the outcome. Any lack of clarity in [34] does not amount to an error of
    law.

25. The grounds at [10] assert that the judge did not take into account the
    overall financial implications  of  the  Appellant's  criminality.   Ms
    Jones did not expand on this in oral submissions.   The  issue  can  be
    dealt with  briefly.   It  is  unarguable  that  the  judge  would  not
    understand the  "overall  financial  implications"  of  a  prosecution.
    Moreover, he was similarly entitled to attach weight to the loss to the
    victim as a result of the offences.

26. At [11] of the grounds the issue of proportionality is raised. There is
    a challenge to the assessment made by the judge.  I conclude  that  the
    judge did not make an error of law when assessing risk and  the  threat
    posed by the Appellant. It follows that it is not necessary for  me  to
    engage with the grounds in so far as they challenge the proportionality
    decision.

27. I was not assisted by  the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds.  They  are
    diffuse. They do not properly identify  an  error  of  law  capable  of
    making a difference to the outcome in this case. The skeleton  argument
    does not improve on the grounds.  The grounds are an attempt to reargue
    the case and amount to  nothing  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
    findings of the judge.   The  findings  are  unarguably  rational.  The
    overall conclusion was open to him on the evidence before him.

28. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the Appellant's appeal
    is maintained.

No anonymity direction is made.
