Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr Y Darboe, Toltops Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Gambia, born on 19  November  1979.  She
    appeals with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    promulgated on 2 July 2018 dismissing her application for  a  permanent
    residence card as a person with a retained right of residence under the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.


 2.  Mr  Darboe,  who  represented  the  appellant  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, submitted that the Judge erred  by  misconstruing  Regulation
    10(5) and 10(6) of the 2016 Regulations  as  limiting  the  appellant's
    ability to retain a right of residence on her  ex-husband's  attainment
    of a permanent right of residence.


 3. She qualifies for a retained right of residence under Regulation  10(5)
    and (6) if she can prove that she was married to an EEA national  which
    lasted for three years, and on the date of their divorce her ex-husband
    was exercising Treaty rights in the UK and that she is also  exercising
    Treaty rights in the UK as an EEA national.


 4. It is also contended that the Judge relied heavily on the  respondent's
    contention, cited at [13] that the appellant failed to provide evidence
    that her ex-husband was in employment between 2011 and 2013.


 5.  Although  it  is  conceded  that  this  period  was  relevant  to  the
    appellant's five years' continuous residence consideration, at the date
    of the respondent's consideration of the appellant's application,  this
    was not significant and relevant to the Judge's  considerations  as  at
    the date of appeal,  as  the  appellant  can  rely  on  any  five  year
    continuous period between  2011  and  2018  to  qualify  for  permanent
    residence.


 6. He submitted that the appellant's  ex-husband  was  pursuing  a  degree
    course at university where he obtained a  Bachelor's  degree  in  2016.
    Further, he had the relevant comprehensive health insurance cover. That
    period amounts to continuous residence of five years in accordance with
    the regulations, which is sufficient to meet  the  permanent  residence
    requirements under Regulation 15(1)(f).


 7. In further written submissions, Mr Darboe  submitted  that  the  period
    spent after she retained the right of residence, namely, 2016  to  June
    2018, should be counted in addition to the period spent by  her  former
    spouse as a student, being from 2013 until 2016 in order  to  meet  the
    five  years'  continuous  residence  for  permanent   residence   under
    Regulation 15(1)(f) of the 2016 Regulations.


 8. On behalf of the respondent,  Ms  Pal  submitted  that  the  issue  was
    whether the appellant's ex-spouse exercised Treaty rights between  2012
    until 2016.


 9. She referred to the  evidence  relating  to  his  education  over  that
    period. He attended  Harrow  College  and  was  awarded  a  certificate
    relating to the completion of five modules. This was awarded on 20 July
    2013. He was at the Moulton College attending a course  in  Agriculture
    for the period 2013 to 2015. He  was  awarded  a  BSc  (Hons)  in  Land
    Management by the University of  Northampton  dated  6  September  2016
    (pages 17-18).


10. Further, the appellant was granted a five  year  residence  card  as  a
    family member on 31 May 2012. The marriage broke down in 2014.


11. Finally, there was a confirmation of medical insurance cover issued  to
    her ex- husband on 2 April 2018, confirming that the cover available to
    him is valid worldwide, which was to expire on 31 December 2018 and  be
    due for renewal on 1 January 2019.


12. In the circumstances, Ms  Pal  conceded  that  the  appellant's  former
    spouse had been exercising Treaty rights for the required period.


Assessment


13. I find that Ms Pals  concession  was  properly  made.  The  appellant's
    former spouse has pursued education resulting finally in the award of a
    Bachelor's degree  in  2016.  He  has  also  had  comprehensive  health
    insurance cover.


14. Having regard to the evidence as a whole, I find that the appellant has
    discharged the burden of proof that she meets the requirements for  the
    issue of a permanent residence card.


    Notice of Decision


    The appeal is allowed.


    Anonymity direction not made.
