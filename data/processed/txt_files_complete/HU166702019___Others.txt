Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr R de Mello, Counsel, instructed by Kingswood
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The  appellants  are  citizens  of  Pakistan.   The  first  and  second
    appellants are married to each other.  They were  both  born  in  1990.
    The third appellant is their daughter.  She was born in  October  2017.
    They appeal a decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  on  5
    December 2019 dismissing  their  appeals  against  a  decision  of  the
    respondent on 25 September 2019 refusing them leave to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom on human rights grounds.

 2. The grounds of appeal are, I find, subtle  and  I  begin  by  examining
    carefully the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to see  exactly  what
    was decided and the reasons for the decision.

 3. This shows that the appellants applied for leave to remain  on  1  July
    2019 on the basis of their private and family lives.  In each  case  it
    was the respondent's decision that  the  appellant  could  not  succeed
    under Appendix FM because none of  the  appellants  had  satisfied  the
    immigration status requirements.  The second appellant had lived in the
    United Kingdom for only nine years and there were no  very  significant
    obstacles to his reintegration into Pakistan.  The first appellant  had
    lived in the United Kingdom for only two years and similarly  faced  no
    very significant obstacle to her integration.  The third appellant  was
    born in the United Kingdom but had clearly not lived  there  for  seven
    years because she was born in October 2017.  Further the  Secretary  of
    State decided there were no  exceptional  circumstances  to  justify  a
    grant of leave outside the Rules.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge gave appropriate self-directions  in  law
    and then set out his findings beginning at paragraph 37 of the Decision
    and Reasons.

 5. The second appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in January 2010 with
    entry clearance as a student valid until October 2012.  His  leave  was
    extended until August 2014.  During the currency of that leave,  on  29
    April 2014, he  applied  for  further  leave  as  a  student  but  that
    application was refused.  He appealed the decision and the  appeal  was
    allowed.  He was subsequently granted leave to remain outside the Rules
    for 60 days, expiring on 7 June 2016.

 6. It is an unhappy fact in this case that the second  appellant's  mother
    died on 12 March 2016 and he visited Pakistan after her  death  to  pay
    his respects.

 7. He returned to the United Kingdom and on 7 June 2016  he  purported  to
    make a timely application for  further  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Rules. If he had made a valid application then  his  leave  would  have
    been extended by operation of law until the application was  determined
    and, if the application were refused,  until  his  appeal  rights  were
    exhausted.

 8. It is plain from a letter from the respondent  dated  22  January  2018
    that the application was not supported by the appellant's passport and,
    by letter dated 23 August 2016, the respondent  asked  the  appellant's
    representatives for his passport. The  passport  was  not  produced  in
    response to the letter and, according  to  respondent's  letter  of  22
    January 2018, the application of 7 June 2016 was rejected as  "invalid"
    on 13 December 2016 with the result, that  the  applicant's  leave  had
    expired on 7 June 2016 and was not extended  by  his  making  a  timely
    application for further leave because, whatever the appellant may  have
    intended, there was no such application.

 9. The second appellant does not accept this analysis.

10. According to paragraph 40 of  the  Decision  and  Reasons,  the  second
    appellant married the first appellant in Pakistan in April  2016.   She
    entered the United Kingdom on 9 October 2016 with entry clearance as  a
    Tier 4 Student valid until January 2018 and the second appellant varied
    his application of 7 June  2016  to  an  application  for  leave  as  a
    dependant partner. However it is clear from the context that the  Judge
    was not ruling that the second appellant had varied a valid application
    but was recording what the appellant purported to have done.

11. On 13 December 2017 the  second  appellant's  application  for  further
    leave to remain as the partner of a  migrant  under  the  points  based
    system was refused.  The "Immigration History" set out in  the  Reasons
    for Refusal dated 25 September 2019 reads as  if  the  decision  on  13
    September 2017 answered the application of for leave outside the  rules
    on 7 June 2016 that was varied to an application for leave as a Tier  4
    Dependant Partner on  23  December  2016.  However,  according  to  the
    "Reasons for Decision"  dated  13  December  2017  the  application  it
    decided was made on 10 May 2017. It is apparent  from  further  reading
    that the application of 10 May 2017 was a variation of  an  application
    made on 23 December 2016.

12. Reasons were given for the refusal. First there was a  "general  reason
    for refusal". According to the respondent,  the  second  appellant  had
    used deception in a language test and relied on the test result when he
    made an application in October 2012.  He denies  any  such  wrongdoing.
    Second, the second appellant was said to have  overstayed  because  the
    application made on 7 June 2016 had been  rejected  as  invalid  on  13
    December 2016. The second appellant had "resubmitted"  the  application
    on 23 December 2016 but by then  he  had  no  continuing  leave  to  be
    extended by reason of the application having been made.

13. The letter dated 13 December 2017 explains (page 12 in  the  Tribunal's
    bundle):

         "Your leave to remain expired on 07 June 2016 and you submitted a
         further application on 7 June 2016. Although this date was prior to
         the expiry of your previous leave, this application was then
         rejected as invalid on 13 December 2016. An invalid application
         does not extend leave under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.

         As you made your current application on 23 December 2016 and varied
         on the 10 May 2017 that is not within 28 days of your leave
         expiring."

14. According to the letter, the attempted application of 7 June  2016  was
    not made good by the variation accompanied by the passport.  Rather  an
    out of time application, dated 23 December 2016, was varied on  10  May
    2017.

15. An additional, adverse,  finding  about  funds  was  not  sustained  on
    administrative review but the refusal on both grounds identified above,
    that is that the second appellant was a TOEIC cheat and that he was  an
    overstayer, was upheld on administrative review.

16. The administrative review decision is dated 22 January 2018 and  on  26
    January 2018 the second appellant applied for further leave  to  remain
    as a dependent  partner.   That  was  refused  on  22  March  2018  and
    maintained on administrative review on 4 May 2018.

17. It is apparent from the above that the decision  made  on  13  December
    2017 was not an answer to the application that the appellant  purported
    to make on 7 June 2016. That application was rejected  on  13  December
    2016. According to the decision letter, the decision dated 13  December
    2017 answered an application made on 23 December 2016 and varied on  10
    May 2017. (For the avoidance of doubt I have checked  these  dates.  By
    coincidence decisions were made on 13 December in successive years.)

18. At paragraph 41 of the Decision and  Reasons  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    referred to the application on 7 June 2016 being "rejected  as  invalid
    on 13 December 2016" and being "resubmitted" on 23 December 2016.

19. At paragraph 41 and 42 the Judge found that the decision on 13 December
    2017 was maintained on both grounds  on  administrative  review  on  22
    January 2018 and on 26  January  2018  the  appellant  make  a  further
    application which was refused and then subject to  an  application  for
    judicial review leading to a consent order. Following the initiation of
    judicial review proceedings the respondent acknowledged that the second
    appellant had made a  human  rights  application  which  would  not  be
    certified as "clearly unfounded" so there was an opportunity for an in-
    country appeal.  The respondent also agreed that the  second  appellant
    would be sent within fourteen days a "Section 120  'one  stop'  notice"
    and within 60 days the second appellant  sent  a  fully  particularised
    human rights claim.  The particulars were sent in July 2019 and  on  25
    September 2019 the application in its final form was  refused.  As  set
    out above, the appeal before me concerned the decision of 25  September
    2019.

20. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted that the refusal  of  25  September
    2019 made no mention of, and did not rely in any way on, allegations of
    dishonesty.

21. It is important to appreciate that the application finally  decided  on
    25 September 2019 was made on 26 January  2018,  a  few  days  after  a
    decision made on 22 January 2018 on administrative review. The decision
    made on 22 January and meant that the  second  appellant  had  not  had
    leave since 7 June 2016. The application made on 26 January was  not  a
    variation of an existing but invalid application that was not made good
    by variation but which was followed by a valid but late application for
    further leave.

22. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted that the "outcome letters" dated 22
    March 2018 and 4 May 2018, answering the application on 26 January 2018
    for further leave to remain  as  a  dependant  partner,  had  not  been
    provided but he regarded it as  undisputed  that  the  application  was
    refused at least in part because the second appellant was regarded as a
    TOEIC cheat.

23. At paragraph 14 of the Decision and Reasons the Judge noted that it was
    Mr de Mello's contention that the decision on 22 January 2018 to refuse
    the application made in 2017 should not have been made. It depended  on
    a finding of dishonesty by the second appellant that was not  justified
    and so by  refusing  the  application  made  on  26  January  2018  the
    respondent was relying, indirectly, on her wrong decision to refuse the
    application on 22 January 2018. Had she not  refused  that  application
    there would have been no need for an application on 26 January 2018.

24. The first appellant applied in time successfully for her  leave  to  be
    extended and she was given leave until 12 September 2018.  On that  day
    she made an application for further  leave  outside  the  Rules.   That
    application was refused on 23 May 2019.  On 12 June 2019  she  applied
    for that decision to be reconsidered and the outcome of that led to the
    appeal in her case.

25. The first appellant has worked in Pakistan as a chemistry teacher for a
    year where she had been awarded an MSc.  Subsequently she  was  awarded
    an MSc in the United Kingdom.

26. The second appellant left Pakistan aged 18 and  at  19  and  has  never
    worked there but was educated in the  United  Kingdom  in  early  adult
    life.

27. The third appellant is a dependent  child  and  applied  for  leave  to
    remain in that capacity.  The application was refused  but  on  1  July
    2019 the third appellant submitted further information  in  support  of
    her human rights claim and it is the refusal of that  application  that
    founds her appeal.

28. The judge found that the  adult  appellants  have  a  close  family  in
    Pakistan. The second appellant said he could  not  return  to  Pakistan
    when his mother was ill and this  had  strained  relationships  in  his
    family.  The judge did not accept this had led to a significant  family
    rift, in particular because the second appellant did return to Pakistan
    when he could albeit after his mother had  then  died  and  the  second
    appellant had been able to provide a death certificate which, the judge
    found, suggested that the second appellant was able to communicate with
    his relatives and that therefore family relationships  had  not  broken
    down completely.

29. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the private  and  family  life
    elements established in the United Kingdom in the case of the first and
    third appellants were nominal and refusal of leave  and  removal  would
    not engage Article 8 at all.  In the  case  of  the  second  appellant,
    given the length of time he had had in the United  Kingdom,  the  judge
    accepted that removal would interfere with his private and family  life
    but the judge found the decision was in accordance  with  the  law  and
    proportionate.

30. The judge noted at paragraph 50 that it was then the  appellants'  case
    the  decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law.   It  was  the
    appellants' case that the Secretary of State was trying to benefit from
    her own wrongdoing.

31. It was said that the respondent had  no  lawful  basis  to  refuse  the
    second appellant's  application  and  so  should  have  approached  the
    present application on the basis that the earlier applications had been
    granted.

32. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found "a number of  fundamental  problems
    with that submission".  He set them out.

33. First, he said, at paragraph 52 of the Decision and  Reasons  that  the
    second appellant's application in 2016 (decided on 22 January 2018) was
    refused on two grounds, alleged dishonesty  and  being  an  overstayer,
    having initially submitted an invalid  application.   The  judge  found
    nothing before  him  to  suggest  that  the  finding  that  the  second
    appellant was an overstayer was wrong or not a reason for  refusal  and
    so he  concluded  that  the  respondent  was  entitled  to  refuse  the
    application  in  2016  and   therefore   the   subsequent   application
    notwithstanding  equivocation  about  the  second  appellant's  alleged
    dishonesty.

34. Alternatively, at paragraph 53 of the Decision and Reasons,  the  Judge
    found that even if the  respondent  ought  to  have  given  the  second
    appellant leave to remain as  a  partner  the  leave  would  have  been
    limited to the length of the partner's leave, i.e. until  12  September
    2018.  Although the respondent does not  seem  to  have  withdrawn  her
    allegation that the second appellant obtained his language  certificate
    irregularly, the decision on 25  September  2019  was  refused  without
    reliance on dishonesty. The decision letter is clear  that  the  second
    appellant was not considered "unsuitable". According to the  Judge,  it
    follows that there was no effort on the part of the Secretary of  State
    to benefit  from  her  wrongdoing  even  if  her  approach  to  finding
    dishonesty was flawed.

35. Further the judge found that  even  if  he  had  been  wrong  in  those
    findings the decision was sound given  that  the  application  was  for
    leave outside the Rules.  The judge found the finding was in accordance
    with  the  law.   It  was  in  furtherance  of  a  legitimate  aim  and
    proportionate. The adult appellants were able to work.  There  were  no
    aggravating factors, such as criminality or inability to speak  English
    or inability to work but they were not entitled to remain in the United
    Kingdom.  The third appellant's interests lay in being with her parents
    and the judge concluded that it was in her  best  interests  to  remain
    with them in her country of nationality.

36. The judge noted that the appellants always had precarious status in the
    United Kingdom and in the case of the first and third appellants it was
    short lived.  Even if things had  worked  out  better  for  the  second
    appellant, they could not have worked out better than his  being  given
    leave until 12 September 2018 when the first appellant's leave ran  out
    and there was no reason to extend the leave of any  of  the  appellants
    beyond then.

37. This decision was criticised.  I have read the grounds of  appeal.   It
    is perhaps helpful to mention here that in the case of  the  first  and
    third appellants they were  given  permission  later  than  the  second
    appellant because it appears that they had  been  overlooked  when  the
    grounds were first settled and the application for permission made.  Be
    that as it may, it is clear they all had permission to appeal. As  well
    as the oral submissions, I have considered particularly Mr  de  Mello's
    skeleton argument.  I confirm  that  I  looked  at  the  document  that
    extends to 23 paragraphs and this was  intended  to  supersede  a  very
    similar but different document that extended to only 21 paragraphs.

38. Mr de Mello summarised the relevant  background  facts.   He  explained
    that the second appellant applied for leave to remain outside the Rules
    on 7 June 2016 and, he said, varied that  application  on  23  November
    2016 for leave to remain as a partner.  When he made the application on
    7 June 2016 he did not submit his passport.  It was his  case  that  he
    had mislaid this passport and he explained that to the respondent.

39. However in the application submitted on 23 November 2016 he did  submit
    his passport.  The 7 June 2016 application was refused on  13 December
    2017 on the grounds that the second appellant was  a  TOEIC  cheat  and
    because he had overstayed for more than 28 days as he had submitted  an
    invalid application on 7 June 2016.  On 16 December 2016 he was told by
    his solicitors that the  application  made  on  23  November  2016  was
    rejected.  The subsequent refusal of leave to remain was on  the  basis
    that the application of 7 June 2016 was invalid.

40. It was the second appellant's case that the second appellant  was  not,
    and should not be treated as, an overstayer. The application made on  7
    June 2016 was not  supported  by  the  passport  as  required  but  the
    passport was produced before  the  application  was  decided  when  the
    second appellant sought to vary the basis of his  claim.  Mr  de  Mello
    relied particularly on paragraph 5 of the Application for Permission to
    Appeal to the Upper Tribunal. This states:

         "As to para 52 the ground was neither raised  by  the  Home  Office
         recent refusal [sic, "Reasons for Refusal?] nor relied upon by  the
         presenting Officer. In any event the ground is fact  sensitive  and
         the FtT failed to  explore  these  facts.  As  per  the  facts  the
         applicant made an in-time application on 07 June 2016 and submitted
         submissions to vary the same application on 23  November  2011(sic,
         this must be a mistake).  The  Home  office  did  not  process  the
         variation in time and invalidated the 07 June 2016  application  on
         13 December 2016. However, 3 days later, on 16  December  2016  the
         Home Office sent an acknowledgment to the  applicant  stating  that
         the  23  November  variation   has   not   been   considered.   The
         acknowledgement failed to establish as to why the variation was not
         granted and why evidential flexibility rule was not  exercised  for
         that application. In this case the FtT  merely  endorsed  the  Home
         Office previous refusal."

41. The refusal dated 25 September 2019 which led to the appeal  did  refer
    to the second appellant being an overstayer from 7 June 2016 but not to
    his application for leave being rejected as invalid.

42. According to paragraph 7 of the  skeleton  argument  dated  19  January
    2021:

         "No submissions were made by either party to the FtT on  the  point
         that the 7 June 2016 application was invalid or the reason why such
         a decision was or could be wrong."

43. The refusal of 13 December 2017 did allege that  the  second  appellant
    was a TOEIC cheat. Judicial review  proceedings  were  brought  against
    that decision and the decision was remade giving the second appellant a
    right of appeal.

44. At paragraph 12 of the skeleton argument it is asserted that:

         "The respondent did not, following the consent order,  maintain  in
         the decision dated 25 September 2019 that the appellant cheated  in
         obtaining his ETS or that he breached paragraph 322, HC  395.   See
         the decision letter."

45. I look at that decision letter now.

46. In summary that letter does indeed confirm that the  respondent  stated
    on 25 September 2019 stated that the application  "does  not  fall  for
    refusal on grounds of suitability under Section S-LTR of Appendix FM".

47. However the second appellant did not meet the eligibility  relationship
    requirements because his partner was not a British citizen  or  settled
    in the United Kingdom or  a  refugee  or  a  person  with  humanitarian
    protection and he did  not  meet  the  immigration  status  eligibility
    requirements because he had been in the United  Kingdom  without  valid
    leave for 1205 days, his leave having ended on 7 June 2016.

48. The Secretary of State found no exceptional reasons within  or  outside
    the Rules to allow the application.

49. Mr de Mello argued that  there  were  special  circumstances  here  and
    particularly that the Secretary of State had breached a basic principle
    of common law.  At paragraph 15 of the skeleton argument he said:

         "The Respondent failed to acknowledge that the cheating  allegation
         in relation to TOEIC was a wrong one which affected his immigration
         status and this was material to  the  decision  on  exceptionality.
         The reference to the Appellant being an overstayer from 7 June 2016
         was to be examined from the  point  of  view  that  the  respondent
         wrongly characterised his application as being invalid  given  that
         the respondent had the first appellant's passport at  the  time  of
         refusing his application".

50. Other points are made.

51. There  is  a  very  pertinent  passage  in  the  refusal  letter  dated
    13 December 2017. It is exhibited at page 12  of  respondent's  bundle
    prepared for the First-tier Tribunal.  It states:

         "Your leave to remain expired on 7 June 2016 and  you  submitted  a
         further application on 7 June 2016.  Although this date  was  prior
         to the expiry of your previous leave,  this  application  was  then
         rejected as invalid on 13 December 2016.   An  invalid  application
         does not extend leave under Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.

         As you made your current application on 23 December 2016 and varied
         on 10 May 2017 this is not within 28 days of your  leave  expiring.
         In  addition,  your  leave  was  not  extended  under  any  of  the
         provisions listed in the Immigration Rules.

         In light of this the Secretary of State has deemed that refusal  is
         appropriate under paragraph 319C(j).  You do not,  therefore,  meet
         the requirements specified in the Immigration Rules in order to  be
         granted leave as a partner of a Points-Based System."

52. The important point is that,  according  to  the  Refusal  Letter,  the
    second appellant's leave expired on 7 June 2016.  He  did  not  make  a
    valid application to extend his leave.

53. However it is plain from the grounds of appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    that the second appellant maintains that this is  wrong  and  that  the
    defect in the application was cured by his varying the application  and
    supplying the passport before the application of 7 June 2016  had  been
    determined.

54. It is less clear to me that this point was ever made to the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge. It does not feature in the grounds  of  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal. It is asserted in Further Submissions at page  A13
    of  the  respondent's  bundle,  paragraph  IV  that  the  "Home  Office
    shouldn't  have  invalidated  his  application"  and  the  "Immigration
    History" at paragraph 5 (page B2) of the reasons for the decision of 25
    September 2019 says of the application of 7 June 2016 that "You  varied
    this application to one for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  Dependant
    Partner on 23 December 2016".

55. It is however plain that, rightly or wrongly, the application to remain
    as a Tier 4 Dependant Partner was refused and the  decision  upheld  on
    administrative review  on  22  January  2018.  That  decision  was  not
    appealed but prompted a further application on 26 January 2018. By then
    any leave that might have been extended by the application  made  on  7
    June 2016 had lapsed and there was no leave existing so  no  leave  was
    extended by the application of 26 January 2018.  It  follows  that  the
    appellant had no leave when he made the application on 26 January  2018
    that, eventually, led to the decision  complained  of  in  the  present
    proceedings.

56. Mr de Mello's intriguing argument that, for the purposes of the present
    appeal, the second appellant should have been treated as a person  with
    leave because that is what he should have been, rather  than  a  person
    without leave, even though this is what he was, suffers  from  lack  of
    evidence to support the solicitors' no doubt honest but not necessarily
    well founded believe that the respondent had changed her mind about the
    effect of the intended  variation  of  leave  and  the  lack  of  clear
    evidence that the complaint was ever made in these proceedings  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal. The uncertainty that exists now rather  underlines
    the importance of challenging decisions in good time when the necessary
    papers are likely to be available. I am not ruling that failures of the
    kind alleged by Mr de Mello cannot be  considered  but  the  evidential
    basis has to be clear and the only clarity here  is  that  the  parties
    disagree about what happened.

57. This was plainly appreciated by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  because
    he said at paragraph 52 of the Decision and Reasons:

         "First, the [Second] Appellant's application in  2016  was  refused
         not only on the grounds of alleged dishonesty but also  because  he
         was  an  overstayer,  having   initially   submitted   an   invalid
         application. I have heard nothing today to suggest that the  latter
         ground was baseless. Therefore it would appear that the  Respondent
         was  entitled  in  any  event  to  refuse  the   application   and,
         consequently, the subsequent application in 2018."

58. I have decided after much, maybe too much, reflection that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal did err because the Judge did not  resolve  the  apparent
    issue between the parties concerning the status  of  the  7  June  2016
    application, namely, "was it an invalid application that was made  good
    by the late production of the passport or was it an invalid application
    so that the second appellant had no leave when  he  later  applied  for
    leave as a dependant?" I remain uncertain about how much  was  made  of
    this before the First-tier Tribunal.

59. If it is established that the second appellant was treated, rightly, as
    a person without leave there is nothing to criticise at any level.

60. However even the Judge was wrong and even if he should  have  concluded
    that the second appellant did have existing leave when he  applied  for
    leave as a husband, and, in the circumstances, that he should have  had
    leave a dependant partner the appeal had to be dismissed.

61. It may well be that the appellants all wish to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom and it may well  be  they  would  contribute  significantly  to
    society if they were permitted  to  remain;  certainly  the  first  and
    second  appellants  appear  to  be  industrious  and  educated  people.
    However, these things are not normally  enough  to  establish  a  human
    right to remain in the United Kingdom. They have not shown  exceptional
    circumstances that would permit a decision to be made outside the Rules
    and they are clearly  in  reasonable  circumstances  in  Pakistan  with
    supportive families.  There  is  no  allowable  case  on  human  rights
    grounds.

62. As Mr Kotas emphasised in his submissions the appellants clearly do not
    satisfy the requirements of the "ten year" Rule.

63. The judge did carry out an article 8  balancing  exercise.  It  is  not
    challenged in the grounds  and  it  should  not  have  been  challenged
    because it is, at the very least, sufficient.

64. I reject any lurking suggestion that reliance on the (allegedly)  false
    contention that the second appellant had made a late application  means
    that the decision on article 8 grounds was "not in accordance with  the
    law". The requirement that a decision refusing leave is "in  accordance
    with the law" is a requirement that there is  a  legal  basis  for  the
    decision rather than the decision being capricious. The assertion  that
    the respondent was wrong to find  that  the  second  appellant  was  an
    overstayer, even if made out, does not make the decision complained  of
    a decision that is "not in accordance with the law".

65. It is right to note that the first and  third  appellants  really  have
    nothing to add to the mix.  The way the case was  presented  before  me
    was that if the second  appellant's  appeal  was  dismissed  there  was
    nothing more to be said.

66. There is no material error and I dismiss these appeals.
