                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellants,  mother  and  son,  appeal,  with  permission,  against  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing  their  appeals  against  the
respondent's decision to refuse  to  issue  them  with  permanent  residence
cards under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  ("the
EEA Regulations"), in the first appellant's case  on  the  basis  of  having
retained a right of residence as the former spouse of an  EEA  national  and
in the second appellant's case as the family member of an EEA national.

The appellants are citizens of the Ivory Coast born  on  19  September  1983
and 4 September 2008 respectively. It is not known when they arrived in  the
UK, but on 20 May 2009 they first applied for residence cards under the  EEA
Regulations following the first appellant's marriage  to  the  sponsor,  Aly
[S], on 14 June 2008 and the birth of her child, the second appellant, on  4
September 2008. The second appellant's father was not the  sponsor,  but  he
was Mamadou [D], a British citizen.

The background to the application, as claimed by the first appellant, is  as
follows. She met Mamadou  [D]  in  the  Ivory  Coast  in  January  2007  and
commenced a relationship with him.  She  became  pregnant  with  the  second
appellant and, as a result of her pregnancy, Mamadou [D] left her. She  then
met the EEA national sponsor Aly [S] in December 2007  in  the  Ivory  Coast
and their relationship began in January 2008. They got married  on  14  June
2008, by proxy, and lived together in the UK  from  2009  to  2012.  In  the
meantime the second appellant's father, Mamadou [D], made contact  with  her
in 2011 as he wanted to see his son. That  led  to  problems  in  the  first
appellant's  marriage  with  the  EEA  sponsor  and  she  then  resumed  her
relationship with Mamadou [D] and had a  daughter  with  him  on  12  August
2012, [MD]. The first appellant then divorced her EEA national husband.  The
divorce was finalised on 11 March 2016. According to  the  first  appellant,
Mamadou [D] has since died in the Ivory Coast.

The first appellant applied for an EEA residence card on 20  May  2009,  but
her application was refused as the sponsor's ID card had  been  reported  as
lost/ stolen. On 20 January 2011 she applied  again  for  an  EEA  residence
card as the family member of Aly [S].  The  documentation  produced  by  the
first appellant shows that she was issued with an EEA residence card  on  20
April 2011, valid until 20 April 2016,  as  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
national. On  4  April  2016  the  first  appellant  applied  for  permanent
residence  cards  for  herself  and  her  son  the  second  appellant.   The
applications were refused on 3 October 2016.

The respondent, in refusing the applications, did not accept that the  first
appellant's marriage to Aly [S] was genuine, as it was considered  that  her
real partner was  Mamadou  [D]  who  was,  according  to  the  documentation
produced, living with her and their children at that  time.  The  respondent
considered that Mamadou [D] was the father of the two children and  believed
that the first appellant's relationship with him was ongoing  and  that  the
marriage to Aly [S] had been entered into  for  immigration  purposes  only.
The respondent concluded that the first  appellant's  marriage  to  the  EEA
national sponsor was  one  of  convenience  and  therefore  she  was  not  a
"spouse" for the purposes  of  Regulation  2  of  the  EEA  Regulations.  In
addition, the respondent noted that the sponsor's  registration  certificate
was revoked on 30 June 2016 on the basis that he  had  been  found  to  have
been  involved  in  an  organised  criminal  network,  following   a   joint
investigation between HMRC and DWP and the Home  Office,  which  facilitated
the entry of French nationals to the UK to participate in  bogus  proxy  and
customary marriages with non-EU nationals and which involved  benefit  fraud
leading to the DWP  being  defrauded  of  ï¿½3.45  million  in  bogus  benefit
payments. The leader of the organised criminal network  had  been  sentenced
to six years imprisonment on 26 April 2016. Further,  the  sponsor's  French
ID card, which had been  submitted  to  the  Home  Office  as  part  of  the
application in  2009,  had  been  reported  by  the  French  authorities  as
lost/stolen in October 2008. As a result of  the  deception  the  respondent
was not satisfied that the evidence  of  the  sponsor's  treaty  rights  was
genuine. The respondent  considered  that  even  if  the  first  appellant's
marriage had been genuine, the respondent could not be  satisfied  that  the
sponsor was a qualified person. The respondent therefore  refused  to  issue
the  appellants  with  residence  cards  under  regulation   15(1)(f)   with
reference to regulation 10(5) and regulation 2 of the EEA Regulations 2006.

The appellants appealed against that decision and their appeals  were  heard
on 15 February 2018 by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Shaerf.  At  the
hearing the judge heard  from  the  first  appellant  who  denied  that  her
marriage to the EEA national sponsor, Aly [S], had been one  of  convenience
and denied knowledge of his criminal activities. The  first  appellant  said
that her children's father, Mr [D], had died in  the  Ivory  Coast  but  had
been a British  national  at  the  time  their  son  was  born.  By  way  of
submissions the appellants' representative, Mr  Khan,  maintained  that  the
first appellant's marriage to the sponsor  had  been  genuine  but  he  also
suggested that the Tribunal could consider the appellants' appeal by way  of
reference to regulation 15A of the EEA Regulations.

Designated Judge Shaerf  rejected  the  first  appellant's  claim  that  her
marriage had been genuine and concluded that the respondent  had  discharged
the burden of proving that it was a marriage of convenience. He found  that,
in any event, the first appellant could not qualify for permanent  residence
on the basis of her own employment and the employment of Aly [S]. The  judge
found there to be no evidence to show that there was a  viable  claim  under
regulation 15A and he dismissed the appeal under the EEA Regulations.

The appellant sought permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the
basis that the judge had failed to consider the full  matrix  of  the  first
appellant's relationship with her  EEA  national  ex-husband  and  that  the
judge had failed to consider all the evidence showing that the  requirements
of regulation 16 of the EEA Regulations 2016 were met on the  basis  of  her
being the primary carer of a British national child.

 Permission was initially  refused,  but  was  subsequently  granted  on  21
September 2018, on the sole ground that the judge  had  arguably  failed  to
consider regulation 16.

Appeal hearing and submissions

At the hearing it was agreed that the only ground of appeal was in  relation
to regulation 16. Mr Khan submitted that the judge had  failed  to  consider
regulation 16 when he had adequate evidence before him to allow  the  appeal
on that basis. Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted  that  regulation  16  was  not
part of the appellants' application  and  was  therefore  not  part  of  the
matrix considered by the respondent. The respondent's decision  focussed  on
regulation 10 as the application had been made on the basis  of  a  retained
right of residence upon divorce. This was therefore a new matter  raised  at
the Tribunal and the provisions of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
Act 2002 applied so that the judge  had  no  jurisdiction  to  consider  the
matter.  Mr Khan replied that the relevant parts of the  2002  Act  did  not
apply to cases under the EEA Regulations and in  any  event  the  respondent
was on notice that the first  appellant  had  a  British  child.  The  judge
ought, therefore, to have considered the matter.

Consideration and findings.

It was Ms Willocks-Briscoe's submission that the judge had  no  jurisdiction
to consider the new matter of regulation 16.  In  that  respect  she  relied
upon  section  85  of  the  NIAA  2002  and  regulation  26(7)  of  the  EEA
Regulations 2006/ Regulation 36(10) of the  EEA  Regulations  2016.  However
whether or not the terms of s85 applied, no  objection  was  raised  by  the
respondent at the hearing despite the matter being raised  in  the  skeleton
argument and, as Mr Khan submitted, the respondent was  already  aware  that
the first appellant had a British child. In addition it is relevant to  note
that no challenge had been made by the respondent to  the  judge's  decision
in that respect prior  to  Ms  Willocks-Briscoe's  submission  and  that  is
particularly relevant  given  that  that  was  the  only  basis  upon  which
permission was granted to the appellants. Accordingly I  find  no  merit  in
the suggestion that the judge had no jurisdiction to consider the matter.

As for the grant of permission itself, whilst the  judge  did  not  consider
regulation 16 of the EEA  Regulations  2016,  he  did  indeed  consider  the
question of a derivative right of residence  under  regulation  15A  of  the
2006 Regulations which Mr Khan accepted were  the  relevant  regulations  in
this case. In any event the relevant criteria are almost identical  in  both
sets of regulations in regulation 15A(4A) and (5) of  the  2006  Regulations
and regulation 16(5) and (6) of the 2016 Regulations.  The  judge  made  his
findings in that respect at [28] of his decision, concluding as follows:

    "There was no evidence before the Tribunal of the type which could show
    the Appellant had any viable claim under Reg  15(A)  of  the  EEA  Regs
    other than the bio-data page of her daughter's passport. There  was  no
    evidence that went anywhere near satisfying the evidential requirements
    outlined in Nilay Patel v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 2028 and  in  particular
    at paras. 23 and 26 and 72-78."

The ground of appeal seeking to challenge the judge's findings  at  [28]  is
that the appellants' appeal bundle contained all the  relevant  evidence  to
show that the requirements of regulation 16 were  met  and  that  the  judge
erred by failing to apply  the  relevant  criteria  in  the  light  of  that
evidence. The  relevant  evidence  referred  to  in  the  ground  of  appeal
consisted of the fact that the first  appellant  was  a  lone  parent  (with
reference to the death certificate  of  the  children's  father),  that  her
daughter was only 5 years of age and was in full-time  education  at  school
and relied on her mother for emotional, parental and financial care.

However it seems to me that the judge was  perfectly  entitled  to  conclude
that there was insufficient evidence to show that the  requirements  of  the
regulations were met. He referred in particular to paragraphs 23, 26 and 72-
78 of Patel, which confirmed that the  relevant  question  was  whether  the
child would, in practice,  be  compelled  to  leave  the  EU  if  the  first
appellant was obliged to leave, and which included the question  of  whether
the child was legally, financially or emotionally  dependent  on  the  first
appellant. Paragraph 25 of Patel makes  it  clear  that  the  third  country
national bears the evidential burden of establishing that the child  citizen
will, in practice, be compelled to leave the EU.  Turning  to  the  evidence
before the judge, there was the  bio-data  page  of  the  first  appellant's
daughter's British passport, a photocopy of a document referred  to  as  the
death certificate of Mamadou [D], and the first  appellant's  claim  in  her
statement to be a  single  mother.  The  judge  was  perfectly  entitled  to
consider that evidence in the context of the fact that the  application  had
not been made on the basis of derivative rights but  on  entirely  different
basis and that the appeal itself focussed almost exclusively upon the  issue
of retained rights of residence. The oral evidence was only  concerned  with
the first appellant's relationship with the EEA sponsor,  with  no  evidence
of her relationship with her children and issues of  their  dependency  upon
her. In view of the fact  that  the  first  appellant  had  relied,  in  her
application, upon a sham marriage linked to a fraud perpetrated on  a  large
scale, the judge could not be expected in any way to  take  at  face  value,
and on the basis of a photocopied document, the claim  that  the  children's
father had died and that they were wholly dependent upon her such  that  the
British child would be forced to leave the EU if she had to leave.

The judge was, in my view, perfectly entitled to conclude as he did,  namely
that the evidence  did  not  go  anywhere  near  satisfying  the  evidential
requirements outlined in Patel and that there was no evidence  of  the  type
required to  show  that  the  first  appellant  had  a  viable  claim  under
regulation 15A. Of course if the first appellant has  such  evidence  it  is
open to her to make an application under the relevant EEA  Regulations,  but
for the purposes of this appeal,  the  judge  was  fully  entitled,  on  the
limited evidence before him and for the reasons cogently  given,  to  reject
the claim and dismiss the appeals. Accordingly I  find  that  there  are  no
errors of law in the judge's decision.

DECISION

The appellants' appeal is accordingly dismissed. The making of the  decision
of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve an error on a point of law. I  do
not set aside the decision. The decision to dismiss the  appellants'  appeal
therefore stands.
