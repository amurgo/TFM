                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
           granted by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge  McClure  on  19
           May 2014 against the determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
           Flynn who had dismissed  the  Respondent's  appeal  against  the
           Appellant's decision dated 20 August 2013 to refuse to grant the
           Respondent leave to remain under Appendix FM of the  Immigration
           Rules (as a spouse), but had allowed her appeal under Article  8
           ECHR in a determination promulgated on 8 April 2014.


      2.    The Respondent is a national of South Africa, born on  31  March
           1964.   Her application for a variation of leave  to  remain  on
           the basis of her private and family life under  Article  8  ECHR
           had been refused because the requirements of Appendix FM had not
           been met.  The Respondent had not shown that her sponsor  was  a
           British Citizen and  so  had  not  complied  with  paragraph  R-
           LRTP.1.1(d)  or  E-LTRP.1.2.   Nor  did  the   Respondent   meet
           paragraph 276ADE in respect of her private life.


      3.    Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  as  sought  by  the
           Appellant was granted because Gulshan (Article 8 - new  rules  -
           correct  approach)  [2013]  UKUT   00640   (IAC)   and   related
           authorities such as Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) cast doubt  on
           whether  Judge  Flynn's  approach  to   Article   8   ECHR   was
           sustainable.   It was arguable  that  the  judge  had  erred  in
           finding that there were compelling circumstances.


      4.    Directions were made by the Upper Tribunal in standard form.




      Submissions - error of law


      5.    Mrs Kenny for the Appellant relied on the grounds and the  grant
           of  permission  to  appeal.   The  decision   was   inadequately
           reasoned.  No exceptional circumstances had been  identified  by
           the judge which would have caused refusal of  the  variation  of
           leave application to result in an unjustifiably  harsh  outcome,
           i.e., a disproportionate breach of  Article  8  ECHR.    Gulshan
           (above) and Nagre (above) had not been followed.  Nothing in the
           judge's findings of fact showed exceptional circumstances or  an
           unjustifiably harsh outcome as  a  consequence  of  the  refusal
           decision.  The Respondent had simply to return home to  make  an
           entry clearance application in the usual way.


      6.    Counsel for the Respondent sought to argue that the  Appellant's
           grounds amounted to no more than a disagreement with a  thorough
           and carefully reasoned  decision,  which  took  account  of  the
           relevant authorities and which had been open to  the  judge.  It
           was  a  factor  in  the  proportionality  assessment  that   the
           Respondent  would  have  to  make  a   fresh   entry   clearance
           application, incur  further  expenses  and  suffer  delay.   The
           application had been made before 5 July  2012  and  that  should
           have been taken into account, i.e.,  the  previous  approach  to
           Article 8 ECHR should have been taken by the Secretary of State.
            The judge had identified compelling circumstances, such as  the
           difficulties which the Respondent would  face  in  returning  to
           South Africa.  She also had a rï¿½le in caring for  her  sponsor's
           elderly parents.  The determination should stand.


      7.    It was not necessary to call upon Ms Kenny in reply.




      The error of law finding


      8.    The tribunal gave its decision at the hearing that the Secretary
           of State's appeal would be  allowed  and  reserved  its  reasons
           which now follow.  The determination was a full and careful  one
           but, the tribunal must find that  the  judge  had  inadvertently
           fallen into material error of law, as the grant of permission to
           appeal indicated.  There was, of course,  no  dispute  that  the
           appeal was bound to fail under the  Immigration  Rules  and  was
           correctly dismissed.


      9.    The failure to comply with the Immigration  Rules  was,  as  the
           judge  correctly  observed,  largely  technical.    Some   might
           consider that the Secretary of  State  might  have  relented  or
           reconsidered once  it  had  been  shown  that  the  Respondent's
           sponsor was a British Citizen, settled and easily able  to  meet
           the stringent financial requirements of Appendix FM.  But  there
           is, of course, no "near miss" principle (see Miah and ors v SSHD
           [2012] EWCA Civ 261), nor did the judge suggest otherwise.


      10.   The difficulty with the  judge's  conscientious  decision  under
           Article 8 ECHR was, as Mrs Kenny submitted, the fact that  there
           was no evidence before the judge  anywhere  near  sufficient  to
           justify her conclusion that there were compelling  circumstances
           applicable to either the Respondent or her sponsor. The guidance
           from Gulshan (above) and related authorities may  be  summarised
           as being that only  if  there  are  arguably  good  grounds  for
           granting leave outside of the Immigration Rules  (i.e.,  in  the
           discretion of the Secretary of State) is it  necessary  for  the
           First-tier Tribunal to go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are
           compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.


      11.   The judge found (see [67] and [68]) that it would  be  possible,
           indeed  by  inference  from  her  determination,  a   relatively
           straightforward matter, for the Respondent and  her  sponsor  to
           provide the specified  evidence  in  a  future  entry  clearance
           application and thus meet the Immigration Rules.  The Respondent
           and her sponsor were  not  in  the  position  of  needing  leave
           outside the Immigration Rules to respect their family  life,  as
           they were able to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
           Rules.  Thus, as the judge recognised at [63], the crux  of  the
           matter was whether it was reasonable to expect the Respondent to
           return  to  South  Africa  to   seek   entry   clearance.    The
           alternative, i.e., the Respondent  and  her  sponsor  moving  to
           South Africa, was not a realistic proposition  for  all  of  the
           reasons the judge  identified.   Indeed,  it  was  so  obviously
           unrealistic and contrary to the relevant parties' wishes that it
           warranted no serious consideration.


      12.   No evidence was identified by the judge to show that there would
           be any undue delay in  the  processing  of  an  entry  clearance
           application from South Africa.  No evidence  was  identified  by
           the judge to show that the sponsor could not travel  there  with
           her for at least part of the time needed.   [85]  to  [87]  show
           that the sponsor's brother is able to assist in the care of  the
           sponsor's elderly parents.  The judge's conclusions at [78]  and
           [79] amount  to  no  more  than  a  finding  that  it  might  be
           inconvenient for the Respondent to return to  South  Africa  for
           the purpose of making an entry clearance application.  The judge
           stated that the Respondent did not know whether the friends with
           whom she stayed in 2012  would  offer  accommodation  again  and
           would ask them only reluctantly.  There was no evidence  of  any
           change of  circumstance  affecting  the  friends.   The  obvious
           inference is that the friends  would  again  assist,  not  least
           because the Respondent would naturally reciprocate in due course
           once she was settled in  the  United  Kingdom.    There  was  no
           suggestion that the sponsor would be unable to assist  with  the
           expense of the journey if required.   The  burden  of  proof  of
           showing insurmountable obstacles, i.e., an  unreasonable  degree
           of difficulty, was on the  Respondent  and  she  had  failed  to
           discharge it.


      13.   The judge was also mistaken at [88]  to  state  that  "there  is
           nothing to suggest that allowing the [Respondent] to remain with
           her partner and his family in the United Kingdom will  interfere
           with the [Appellant's] overall control of immigration."  Control
           of immigration, with respect to the judge, is determined by  the
           Immigration Rules and is a  matter  for  the  executive  arm  of
           government.


      14.   In the tribunal's view, the question of whether the variation of
           leave application should have been considered under  the  pre  9
           July 2012  regime  in  relation  to  Article  8  ECHR  makes  no
           practical difference.  The judge was addressed on the basis that
           the post 9 July 2012 regime applied to Article  8  ECHR.   There
           was no claim that the  Respondent  had  shown  by  the  evidence
           presented with her variation of leave application that  she  was
           able to meet paragraph 284 of the  Immigration  Rules.  Edgehill
           [2014] EWCA Civ 402, decided after the judge's determination and
           not cited to her, indicates that the previous rules apply, i.e.,
           that the Secretary of State was not entitled to base her refusal
           on the new rules, but that can make no difference to the present
           appeal  which  has  always  turned  on  Article   8   ECHR   and
           proportionality.  The  proportionality  outcome  on  the   facts
           properly understood of the  present  appeal  is  the  same  when
           public and  private  interests  are  weighed  in  the  balancing
           exercise.


      15.    For  all  of  these  reasons,  the  tribunal  finds  that   the
           determination contains material errors of law, such that it must
           be set aside and remade.  The Secretary of State's appeal to the
           Upper Tribunal is allowed.




      Discussion and fresh decision


      16.   The submissions by both parties made in relation to  the  errors
           of  law  embraced  all  relevant  arguments   and   no   further
           submissions were needed to dispose of the appeal.


      17.   The issue in this human rights appeal is  proportionality.   The
           legitimate aim included in Article 8.2  ECHR  which  is  usually
           summarised  as  immigration  control  embraces  many   important
           matters,  most  if  not  all  of  which  are  ultimately  policy
           decisions for government: for further recent discussion of  such
           issues see Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
           (IAC).


      18.   Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT
           00640 (IAC) indicates that the tribunal has no power  to  avoid,
           waive or circumvent the Immigration Rules by in effect resorting
           to Article 8 ECHR save in exceptional circumstances, i.e., where
           the consequences of such refusal would be so unduly  harsh  that
           they would amount to a disproportionate failure by the state  to
           respect private or family life of a relevant person affected  by
           such refusal.  This amounts to no more than a restatement of the
           essential principles of proportionality,  and  directly  recalls
           [20] of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.


      19.   As  appears  from  the  discussion  above,  there  was  no  such
           evidence.  The Respondent and her partner's  private  interests,
           temporary  inconvenience  and  possibly  a  modest   period   of
           separation, are substantially outweighed by the public  interest
           in maintaining effective and fairly applied immigration control.
           The First-tier Tribunal's decision can only  be  remade  in  one
           way, that is, that the appeal against the Secretary  of  State's
           decision must be dismissed.


      DECISION


      The making of the previous decision involve the making of an error  on
a     point of law.  The appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  allowed.   The
decision    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Flynn is set aside  and  remade  as
follows:

      The appeal under the Immigration Rules is DISMISSED

      The appeal under Article 8 ECHR is DISMISSED

      Signed                                 Dated


      Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Manuell








      TO THE RESPONDENT
      FEE AWARD


      The appeal was dismissed and so there can be no fee award


      Signed                                  Dated
