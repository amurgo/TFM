                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The Appellant is a citizen of Algeria who has been  granted  leave  to
      appeal to the Tribunal against the determination  of  an  Adjudicator,
      Mrs L H S Verity, who dismissed his appeal  against  the  Respondent's
      decision giving directions for his removal from the United Kingdom and
      refusing to grant asylum.


   2. The hearing before us took place on 27 June 2002.  Mr G  Hodgetts  for
      Irving & Co. appeared on behalf of the Appellant, and Mr R  Holmes  of
      the Home Office Presenting Officer's Unit appeared on  behalf  of  the
      Respondent.

   3. Mr Hodgetts put an amended skeleton argument  before  us.   He  argued
      that the Appellant was at risk on return to Algeria on account of  the
      fact that his passport would show, in effect, that he had been refused
      asylum in the United Kingdom.  Mr Joffe,  in  his  first  report,  had
      expressed the view that the Algerian perception of the United  Kingdom
      is that there was an extensive network of  fundamentalists  here.   He
      would be detained under the terrorist legislation  which  allowed  for
      twelve days being held in detention incommunicado.  The  Secretary  of
      State had  agreed  in  other  cases  that  detention  and  questioning
      occurred on return to Algeria.  There was  some  indication  that  the
      period of twelve days was in practice exceeded.  The case was not just
      based on an unlawful extension of detention, but that  any  period  of
      detention on return would be unlawful under Article  5  of  the  Human
      Rights Convention.  The lowest submission was that any detention, even
      without mistreatment, would be unlawful under Article 5,  and  it  was
      argued that, although there had to be a flagrant denial of the  rights
      secured by the Convention, as had been held  was  the  requirement  in
      Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702 (starred) that would be the  case  here,
      given the facts.  The detention did not fall within any exceptions  to
      Article 5(1).  A detention which was completely unlawful  would  be  a
      flagrant denial of the Appellant's rights.  There were both procedural
      and substantive aspects  to  this.   If  the  substantive  right  were
      breached, it was flagrant as the very essence of the  right  would  be
      taken away.  It could  not  properly  be  argued  that  the  exception
      contained in Article 5(1)(c) was applicable.  This was  a  consequence
      of the Adjudicator's findings concerning the Appellant's  history,  at
      paragraph 31 of her determination.  The Tribunal was referred  to  the
      various judgments of the European Court of Human Rights set out in the
      skeleton argument.  There could  be  no  reasonable  suspicion  on  an
      objective basis that he had committed an offence and in effect,  since
      there could be no reasonable suspicion of him,  holding  him  for  the
      purpose simply  of  obtaining  information  would  be  unlawful.   The
      question of the period of detention was also relevant.


   4. It was also the case that there would be a  breach  under  Article  3.
      Here the decision in Ribitsch v Austria [1995] 21EHRR573  showed  that
      any use of physical force would be a violation of Article 3 unless  it
      was as a consequence of something in the Appellant's own conduct.

   5. There was a lack of direct  evidence  about  abuse  of  failed  asylum
      seekers, but there was evidence that there were  no  complaints  as  a
      consequence of fears of reprisals  and  also  fears  on  the  part  of
      lawyers of reprisals and this could be seen from the State  Department
      report.  There was a culture in Algeria of police ill-treating  people
      in custody generally.  People would be unlikely to go to  lawyers  and
      make official complaints.  As regards the suggestion in  the  document
      produced by Mr Holmes that there had been  hundreds  of  returns  from
      other European countries, that was not  disputed,  but  there  was  no
      evidence of any returns  from  the  United  Kingdom  and  therefore  a
      distinction had to be drawn, particularly in the light of  the  events
      of 11 September 2001 and their aftermath.  General inferences could be
      drawn from the human rights situation in the country in  question,  as
      had been said by the court in Juma.

   6. In his submissions, Mr Holmes argued that the case was very much  tied
      in with the particular facts.  The Appellant was a married man  of  46
      who had no history of involvement  with  terrorists  or  suspicion  of
      involvement with terrorists and no criminal record.  He had a properly
      issued Algerian passport.  He had previously travelled  to  Spain  and
      returned on  that  passport.   He  had  been  exempted  from  military
      service.  There was no reason to believe that the Algerian authorities
      had any interest in him when he left Algeria.  He  did  not  claim  to
      have any sympathy with fundamentalists and the  only  factor  was  the
      refusal of leave to enter on 29 January 2000.  The original report  of
      Mr Joffe was four years old and Mr Roberts' report was two years  old.
      They  involved  people  with  very  different  histories   from   this
      Appellant.  Professor Seddon's report was  opinion  and  not  concrete
      facts.  It was not clear how often he  had  been  to  Algeria  or  how
      recently.  In contrast,  the  UNHCR  were  based  on  the  ground  and
      concerned on an ongoing basis.  The Canadian  report  produced  by  Mr
      Holmes was of significance.  If there were widespread mistreatment  of
      failed asylum seekers, it was most unlikely the UNHCR or  the  various
      countries who returned people would be unaware.  The Appellant was not
      a person who had been rejected on the basis of the  exclusion  clauses
      and this was the only category which concerned the  UNHCR.   Professor
      Seddon also referred to the good intelligence record keeping system in
      Algeria, and therefore it was unlikely that there would be significant
      delays in establishing that the Appellant was of no  interest.   There
      would be no file on him and therefore no suspicion  and  he  would  be
      less likely to be held for long or mistreated.


   7. As regards Article  3,  it  was  the  case  that  the  nature  of  any
      mistreatment was relevant in the  context  of  the  situation  of  the
      individual.  As regards the Article 5  argument,  it  was  clear  from
      paragraphs 107 to 112  in  Devaseelan  that  different  criteria  were
      appropriate where a person  was  being  returned  to  a  non-signatory
      state, rather than the  nature  of  the  obligations  owed  under  the
      Convention by signatory states.

   8. By way of reply, Mr Hodgetts referred to the report  of  the  Research
      Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Ottawa,  including
      the comment both from the local UNHCR office and the Algerian  Foreign
      Ministry that persons returned to Algeria did not encounter  problems.
      It was unclear what was meant by  "problems".   The  Foreign  Minister
      would be unlikely to detail problems in any  event.   There  was  also
      reference to the desirability of seeking guarantees from the  Algerian
      government for returnees, and that had not been  done  in  this  case.
      The earlier report of Mr Joffe and that of Mr Roberts  made  it  clear
      that there were risks to failed asylum  seekers  on  return,  and  the
      Joffe report had in any event now been updated.  The authorities  were
      more likely to be keen to question UK  returnees  since  11  September
      2001.

   9. We reserved our determination.

  10. This appeal comes before us as a consequence of remittal by the  Court
      of Appeal of an earlier determination of the  Tribunal.   In  essence,
      the Court of Appeal remitted the case on the  basis,  as  set  out  at
      paragraph 27 of its judgment, that the Appellant  was  entitled  to  a
      properly reasoned decision upon the question of whether  he  would  be
      subjected to the garde � vue procedure, and if it were concluded  that
      he might, he was entitled also to a properly  reasoned  decision  upon
      the  question  of  whether  he  might  suffer  treatment  that   would
      constitute a violation of his rights under  Article  3  of  the  Human
      Rights Convention.

  11. In essence, the Appellant's claim is that as failed asylum  seeker  he
      would be at risk on return to  Algeria  since  the  authorities  would
      realise he was a failed asylum seeker.  He is  aged  approximately  46
      and has a wife and three children who presently live in  Algeria.   He
      has never had an interest in politics and has never shown sympathy for
      or joined a terrorist group.  It appears that he experienced  problems
      from three unidentified men who demanded what in effect was protection
      money from him from his business and he paid this for over five  years
      but claimed never to have established the identity of  the  group  who
      were extorting money from him.  The Adjudicator did not accept that he
      had left  Algeria  because  he  feared  persecution  from  either  the
      authorities or  an  Islamic  fundamentalist  group.   The  Appellant's
      passport contains a refusal of leave to enter stamp which, it has been
      argued, and which was  previously  accepted  by  the  Tribunal,  would
      identify the Appellant on return to  the  Algerian  authorities  as  a
      failed asylum seeker.

  12. The Tribunal has before it two reports  of  Professor  Seddon  of  the
      University of East Anglia, the more recent of which  was  prepared  in
      the light of the Tribunal's  early  determination  and  the  Court  of
      Appeal's decision, and was designed to deal with various issues raised
      during those proceedings.  There are also two reports from  Mr  Joffe,
      the earlier one some four years old and the more recent one some three
      months old, the latter updating the former.  There is also a report of
      a Dr Hugh Roberts dated 30 April 2000.  The claim has in essence  been
      argued under the Human Rights Convention, in particular Articles 3 and
      5.

  13. In his earlier report,  dated  26  September  2001,  Professor  Seddon
      expressed the view that failed asylum seekers were  highly  likely  on
      their return to Algeria to be detained by the Immigration and Security
      Services for further questioning as to the reasons  for  being  abroad
      and for having sought asylum.  The reports of Mr Joffe and Dr  Roberts
      bore this likelihood out.  Professor Seddon went on to say that  those
      who  are  detained  for  questioning  may  be   held   garde   �   vue
      (incommunicado) for up to a week or so in order to allow stories to be
      checked and records consulted.  He notes that the Algerian authorities
      have a good intelligence  and  record  keeping  system  which  usually
      allows them to identify those who have been, for  example,  identified
      as suspected political activists with  one  of  the  illegal  Islamist
      movements or paramilitary groups, or as deserters from the  army.   He
      goes  on  to  say  that  individuals  with  suspicious   or   criminal
      backgrounds are still highly likely to be held in detention or  passed
      swiftly to the appropriate military authorities and detention  centres
      respectively.  He says that in detention there remains a  strong  risk
      that  they  will  be  subjected  to  brutal,  inhuman  and   degrading
      treatment.  Those without a  file  with  the  authorities,  those  not
      providing any basis for being  suspected  of  "undesirable"  political
      affiliations, and those whose military service status is regular,  are
      less likely to be held for long and are less likely to  be  beaten  or
      brutally treated while in detention.  He considers, however, that  the
      very fact that they have sought asylum in the first place puts them at
      risk and refers to cases known to him from former asylum cases refused
      by the Home Office where returnees have been  subjected  to  prolonged
      detention and very rough interrogation.


  14. In his supplementary report, which is dated 13 June 2002, he  comments
      among other things, at page 81 of the bundle,  that  those  without  a
      file with the authorities, those not providing  any  basis  for  being
      suspected of "undesirable"  political  affiliations  and  those  whose
      military service status is regular are less likely to be held for long
      and less likely to be beaten or brutally treated whilst in  detention.
      Nevertheless, there is a real risk that such people will  be  detained
      for further interrogation and a real risk of brutal treatment.

  15. As against this, we note from the CIPU  country  assessment  of  April
      2002, it is reported that the UNHCR has not called for a  ban  on  the
      return of rejected asylum seekers. The basis for this is a paper  from
      the Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Ottawa,
      to which we shall return in due course, and also a UNHCR letter  dated
      13 March 2000 which is referred to in the index.  There  is  reference
      in the Research  Directorate  Board  paper  that  every  year  several
      European countries, including France, Spain, Germany, Belgium,  Sweden
      and Denmark, return hundreds of persons to  Algeria,  either  under  a
      formal agreement with Algeria or on a case by  case  basis.   We  note
      also a reference at paragraph 5C4 of the CIPU report to  a  report  of
      the Netherlands Immigration Department on the  situation  in  Algeria,
      dated July 2001, that applying for asylum abroad is  not  regarded  by
      the Algerian authorities as a political act, that an Algerian  has  no
      need to fear persecution on return solely on the grounds of submitting
      an asylum application, and that Western countries do  not  regard  the
      overall situation in Algeria as a reason not to deport  rejected  non-
      suited asylum seekers and other inadmissible persons to that country.


  16. The point is also made in the Research Directorate of the  Immigration
      and Refugee Board of Ottawa report that whereas none of the  countries
      from Europe appears to have carried out a formal study of what happens
      to "deportees", they all believe they would have heard had persons who
      were returned to Algeria encountered serious difficulties.  The  point
      is made that such deportees sometimes contact the embassies  concerned
      to sort out administrative matters relating to the time spent  in  the
      other country and none have ever complained of their treatment by  the
      Algerian authorities upon their return to Algeria.  The point is  also
      made that it could be expected that the relatives of such people would
      in some cases make it known if a person suffered at the hands  of  the
      Algerian authorities, but there has been no incident of this sort ever
      brought to the attention of the embassies concerned.  Against that, Mr
      Hodgetts makes the point that there is  some  evidence  in  the  State
      Department report of fear of reporting problems both by deportees  and
      their lawyers, for fear of reprisals.  He also refers  to  Mr  Joffe's
      report that the Algerian authorities regard  European  laxity  as  the
      reason for the persistence of terrorism and primarily  accuse  Britain
      and Germany of this.  We  also  note  from  the  Research  Directorate
      Report that the UNHCR office  in  Algiers  and  the  Algerian  Foreign
      Ministry both reported  that  persons  returned  to  Algeria  did  not
      encounter problems.  There is a reference also to  UNHCR  recommending
      guarantees being sought from the Algerian government  in  relation  to
      proposed returnees and there should be extreme  reluctance  to  return
      rejected applicants where the exclusion clause has been  applied.   We
      note that the sources for Mr Joffe's report, as  set  out  in  his  11
      March  2002  report,  include  the  statement  that  the   information
      concerning the end of the  triage  process  on  travel  documents  was
      provided from official sources within the Algerian diplomatic  service
      and that information coming from security sources  has  been  used  in
      assessing the treatment of returned asylum seekers.  Professor  Seddon
      describes  his  observations  with  respect  to  the   identification,
      detention  and  questioning  of  "suspicious  individuals"   including
      returned asylum seekers are  based  on  the  known  behaviour  of  the
      Algerian Embassy in the United Kingdom and of immigration officials in
      Algeria as reported by various  sources  including  other  experts  on
      Algeria (i.e. Mr Joffe and Dr Roberts).  He states that these  sources
      include  the  Algerian  Immigration  Procedures  reports  by  Algerian
      academic and professional friends and colleagues who have observed the
      procedures involved at first  hand  on  arrival  at  Immigration  when
      returning  themselves  after  having  been  legitimately  out  of  the
      country.


  17. We  consider  that  there  is  weight  to  Mr  Holmes'  argument  that
      particular significance has to be attached to reports  on  the  ground
      and, in particular, from the UNHCR.  We bear in mind also  that  there
      is no indication as to the histories  of  those  persons  to  whom  Mr
      Seddon refers  at  page  24  of  the  bundle  in  his  earlier  report
      concerning the substantiation by various reports from personal friends
      and colleagues who have observed the process of people being  detained
      and interrogated on return as failed  asylum  seekers.   There  is  no
      indication as to whether these people fell into any of the  categories
      that would be likely to cause them to be of particular concern to  the
      Algerian authorities.

  18. In our view, the evidence is sufficiently  clear  that  the  Appellant
      would be questioned  on  return  to  Algeria.   This  would  be  as  a
      consequence of the fact that he would be identified as a failed asylum
      seeker from his passport.  We do not consider, however,  that  it  has
      been  shown  that  there  is  a  real  risk  that  he  would  be  held
      incommunicado for his story to be checked.  We accept that  of  course
      his story would require to be checked by the authorities but  equally,
      as Professor Seddon points out in his report, the Algerian authorities
      have a good intelligence and record keeping system which would  enable
      them to identify whether he fell into one of the suspected categories.
       We attach particular significance  to  the  report  of  the  Research
      Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Ottawa, the author
      of which met with the local UNHCR office, and also to  the  quotations
      that we have set  out  from  the  Netherlands  Immigration  Department
      report on the situation in Algeria as of July 2001.  We accept that it
      would have been preferable if we had had the entirety of  that  report
      before us, but consider that the quotations that  have  been  provided
      serve as a helpful indication of the views taken by that body  of  the
      relevant issues.  We  accept  that  there  might  be  some  reluctance
      amongst people returned and  their  representatives  to  complain,  we
      cannot ignore the apparent  entire  absence  of  any  complaint  being
      recorded by or on behalf of anybody who has been returned to  Algeria.
      The fact that a number of  countries  return  hundreds  of  people  to
      Algeria and the absence of any  reported  complaints  must  speak  for
      itself.  Whereas there might be some slightly  enhanced  suspicion  of
      the Appellant as a consequence  of  coming  from  the  United  Kingdom
      rather than one of the other European  countries  named,  we  consider
      that in the light of the good information services  available  to  the
      Algerian authorities, it would be a relatively speedy and easy  matter
      to check his history and to discover that he is not a  person  who  is
      likely  to  be  regarded  as  causing  any  threat  to  the   Algerian
      authorities or the Algerian state or people.


  19. We go on, however, to consider what the situation would be if we  were
      wrong and he were at real risk of being held incommunicado.   We  bear
      in mind the conclusions of the Tribunal in  Devaseelan,  to  which  we
      have referred above concerning Article 5.  It is important to bear  in
      mind when considering the relevant case law that, as was  pointed  out
      by the Tribunal at paragraphs 107 to 111 in Devaseelan, in  particular
      at paragraph 109, the  Appellant's  situation  on  return  to  Algeria
      cannot be judged by the standards that  would  apply  in  a  signatory
      state, because a signatory state would not be obliged to remain silent
      in the face of the claim.  As a consequence, as Mr Hodgetts  accepted,
      it is only if there would be a flagrant denial or gross  violation  of
      the Appellant's Convention rights that we would  be  able  to  find  a
      breach of his Article 5 rights on return if held incommunicado  for  a
      week or so as it was described by Prof Seddon.  The point was made  at
      paragraph 111 in Devaseelan that as regards the  case  of  a  flagrant
      denial or gross violation of the Appellant's rights this  would  occur
      were the right to be completely denied or nullified in the destination
      country.  The fact that the Adjudicator concluded  that  she  did  not
      find the Appellant's claim credible does not in  any  sense  bind  the
      Algerian authorities when  considering  the  Appellant  on  return  to
      Algeria.  As a failed asylum seeker returning to a country  which  has
      had very significant problems  with  terrorism  in  recent  years,  we
      consider that his detention could be  properly  regarded  as  being  a
      consequence  of  reasonable  suspicion  of  him  having  committed  an
      offence.  In our view, in a state with the recent political history of
      Algeria, it would be far from unreasonable for a person to be held for
      a period of time for such checks to be kept out, even if this were  to
      be the case that he were held incommunicado.  We emphasise the context
      in the country of return as was the case in  Devaseelan.   We  do  not
      consider that there would be a complete denial or nullification of his
      Article 5 rights, were he to be held as  was  described  by  Professor
      Seddon in his first report as being held incommunicado  for  up  to  a
      week or so to enable his  story  to  be  checked  and  records  to  be
      consulted.  We consider that in the context, detaining  him  for  that
      period would not be an excessive period such as  to  give  rise  to  a
      breach of his human rights.  We do not consider that it can reasonably
      be said that he  would  be  being  held  purely  for  the  purpose  of
      effective internment as is argued in the amended paragraph 12  of  the
      skeleton argument.  We  bear  in  mind  that  the  various  quotations
      contained in the skeleton argument are almost exclusively  from  cases
      involving complaints of breaches of the  Human  Rights  Convention  by
      signatory states, and again we emphasise the importance of bearing  in
      mind that Algeria is not a signatory to  the  European  Convention  on
      Human Rights and cannot be judged by the same standards applicable  to
      a signatory state.


  20. Nor do we consider that the evidence bears out the contention that the
      Appellant faces a real risk of prohibited ill-treatment in  detention.
      We bear in mind the background evidence  concerning  what  happens  to
      detainees in Algeria and accept that there is to a degree a culture of
      violence towards suspects there.  This has to be seen in  the  context
      of the Appellant's history as would relatively speedily  be  revealed,
      in our view.  We do not see the objective  evidence  as  showing  that
      there is such a degree of regularity of mistreatment of a  significant
      nature of detainees as to give rise to a real risk of  breach  of  the
      Appellant's Article 3 rights on return.  We note the various  comments
      of the experts as set out at paragraph 5 of the skeleton argument and,
      in particular, the quotation from Dr Roberts, albeit it in a  somewhat
      different context from this case.  We note his comment that  a  failed
      asylum seeker would have that fact held against him and it could  have
      consequences prejudicial to his safety.  We do not see that as  giving
      rise to an arguable real risk that this  Appellant  with  his  history
      will be significantly mistreated on  return.   We  note  Mr  Hodgett's
      argument, based on the quotation from Ribitsch, that any  recourse  to
      physical force which has not  been  made  strictly  necessary  by  the
      person's own conduct is in principle an infringement of the Article  3
      rights of that person.  We bear in mind also the more  recent  comment
      at paragraph 91 of the judgment of the European Court of Human  Rights
      in Kudlav, Poland, that ill-treatment must attain a minimum  level  of
      severity to fall within the scope of Article 3.  We do  not  find  the
      objective evidence to show that there is  a  real  risk  of  treatment
      amounting to a breach of Article 3 being meted out to  this  Appellant
      on return.


  21. In conclusion therefore, we do not consider the case as being made out
      that the Appellant faces a real risk of being  held  incommunicado  in
      the garde � vue procedure by the  Algerian  authorities.   If  we  are
      wrong in that regard, we consider that even if he were held  it  would
      be in the course of detention for the period of checking his  identity
      and any records.  We do not consider that the evidence shows that such
      a period of detention would be such or in such conditions as  to  give
      rise to his Article 5 rights, nor that there is a real  risk  that  in
      the course of that detention he will be subjected to treatment of  the
      kind giving rise to breach of his Article 3 rights.

  22. This appeal is dismissed.
