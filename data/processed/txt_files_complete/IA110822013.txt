Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs F McCrae of Counsel instructed by Fursdon
Knapper Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J Kingham, a Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was  born  on  23rd  January,
    1984.  The appellant obtained entry clearance as a Tier 4  Student  for
    the period 4th October, 2011 to 30th September, 2012  and  entered  the
    United Kingdom on 7th October, 2011.  In an application  which  appears
    to have been submitted to the respondent on 26th September,  2012,  the
    appellant applied for a variation of his leave to enter or remain.   On
    23rd March, 2013 the respondent refused to vary leave and the appellant
    appealed that decision.

2.   The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Moore  at
    North Shields on 28th  June,  2013.   In  a  determination  promulgated
    following that hearing  on  15th  July,  2013,  the  Immigration  Judge
    dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    dismissed  the  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds.   The  grounds   of
    application relied on the judgment of the Administrative  Court  in  MM
    [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) and assert that if the  judge  had  taken  the
    approach suggested in MM he would have allowed the  appellant's  appeal
    on Article 8 human rights grounds.  The  appellant  could  not  show  a
    gross annual income of at least �18,600 or that the exemption  criteria
    on compassionate  grounds  warranted  a  grant  of  leave  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  The judge found that the appellant did not meet the
    requirement of paragraph 276ADE and dismissed the appeal.

3.   The grounds suggested that  the  judge  failed  to  take  into  account
    additional income that was being provided  by  the  appellant's  mother
    which amounted to a further �4,000 per annum and the judge also  failed
    to take account of the fact that  the  appellant  had  been  awarded  a
    degree in applied business computing and, therefore had reasonable  job
    prospects.

4.   Counsel relied on the grounds and suggested that the  judge  had  erred
    by not applying the decision of the Administrative Court in MM.  It was
    accepted that the appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Counsel suggested that the  judge  found  that  the
    appellant's income was �1,464.28, but the judge made no findings as  to
    the amount of support the appellant received from his mother.   Counsel
    suggested that where one considers what Blake J said at paragraphs  122
    to  126  the   decision   of   the   Immigration   Judge   is   clearly
    disproportionate.

5.   The appellant was not in employment at the  time  of  the  application,
    but he had previously been employed until January, 2013 on  an  ad  hoc
    basis.  No evidence was adduced,  however,  at  the  hearing  that  the
    appellant had been seeking employment.

6.   The judge dealt with the question of employment at paragraph 25 of  the
    determination and noted  that  the  appellant  had  not  studied  since
    September, 2012 although he claimed to have done some part-time factory
    work.  There was, however, Mrs McCrae submitted, no primary finding  as
    to the support given by the appellant's mother which the  judge  should
    have considered.  The judge also should have considered the appellant's
    job prospects.  He has a third class honours degree in applied business
    computing.

7.   The Presenting Officer suggested that the grounds were misguided.   The
    judge said at paragraph 22 of the determination that  it  would  appear
    that an annual income of �14,664.23 had been demonstrated by  reference
    to payslips from the appellant's  spouse  from  her  employer  2  Touch
    Limited and the appellant's  bank  statement  from  GT  Bank.   However
    monies from GT Bank included her mother's support.

8.   MM was an entry clearance application and at paragraphs 123 to 124  the
    court make it clear that it was actually a combination of one  or  more
    of five features of the Rules  which  made  it  onerous  and  therefore
    unjustified and disproportionate.  The five features  were  first,  the
    setting of the minimum income level above the sum of �13,400 identified
    by  the  Migration  Advisory  Committee  as  the   lowest   maintenance
    threshold, the requirement of �16,000 of savings, the use of a 30 month
    period for forward income projection, the disregard  of  even  credible
    and reliable evidence of undertaking of third party support and finally
    the disregard of the spouse's own earning capacity during the 30  month
    period of the initial entry.

9    However, the  Presenting  Officer  pointed  out,  in  this  appeal  the
    spouse's income had been taken into account and third party support was
    allowed in certain circumstances.

10.  In effect, in this appeal only one  of  the  features  which  had  been
    identified in MM applied, namely the minimum income level.

11.  As for the question of job offers, the Home Office  Presenting  Officer
    pointed out that  there  was  no  evidence  of  any  job  offers.   The
    appellant's previous work  history  was  not  at  all  helpful  as  the
    Immigration Judge pointed out.  As to whether or not the  decision  was
    disproportionate, the Secretary of State had withdrawn the decision  to
    remove the appellant.

12.  Counsel suggested that the decision of the  judge  did  not  take  into
    account the support offered to the appellant by his mother.  The income
    referred to at paragraph 22 of the determination dealt  only  with  the
    appellant's spouse's income and the appellant's savings in his GT  Bank
    account.  I reserved my decision.

13.  Since 9th July, 2012 the Immigration Rules governing applications  made
    by a spouse impose a mandatory financial requirement to be met  by  the
    sponsor of a minimum income of �18,600 per annum gross.  E-LTRP3.1, 3.2
    and 3.3 provide as follows:-

         "E-LTRP.3.1. The applicant must provide specified evidence, from
         the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2., of-
         (a) a specified gross annual income of at least-
         (i) �18,600;
         (ii) an additional �3,800 for the first child; and
         (iii) an additional �2,400 for each additional child; alone or in
         combination with
         (b) specified savings of-
         (i) �16,000; and
         (ii) additional savings of an amount equivalent to 2.5 times the
         amount which is the difference between the gross annual income from
         the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2.(a)-(f) and the total
         amount required under paragraph E-LTRP.3.1.(a); or

         (c) the requirements in paragraph E-LTRP.3.3.being met, unless
         paragraph EX.1. applies.
         In this paragraph "child" means a dependent child of the applicant
      who is-
         (a) under the age of 18 years, or who was under the age of 18 years
         when they were first granted entry under this route;
         (b) applying for entry clearance or is in the UK as a dependant of
         the applicant;
         (c) not a British Citizen or settled in the UK; and
         (d) not an EEA national with a right to remain in the UK under the
         Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.
         E-LTRP.3.2. When determining whether the financial requirement in
      paragraph ELTRP.
         3.1. is met only the following sources may be taken into account-
         (a) income of the partner from specified employment or self-
         employment;
         (b) income of the applicant from specified employment or self-
         employment unless they are working illegally;
         (c) specified pension income of the applicant and partner;
         (d) any specified maternity allowance or bereavement benefit
         received by the applicant and partner in the UK;
         (e) other specified income of the applicant and partner;
         (f) income from the sources at (b), (d) or (e) of a dependent child
         of the applicant under paragraph E-LTRP.3.1. who is aged 18 years
         or over; and
         (g) specified savings of the applicant, partner and a dependent
         child of the applicant under paragraph E-LTRP.3.1. who is aged 18
         years or over.
         E-LTRP.3.3. The requirements to meet this paragraph are-
         (a) the applicant's partner must be receiving one or more of the
      following -
         (i) disability living allowance;
         (ii) severe disablement allowance;
         (iii) industrial injury disablement benefit;
         (iv) attendance allowance;
         (v) carer's allowance; or
         (vi) personal independence payment; and
         (b) the applicant must provide evidence that their partner is able
         to maintain and accommodate themselves, the applicant and any
         dependants adequately in the UK without recourse to public funds. "

13.  The requirements for limited leave to remain as a partner are  set  out
    in R-LTRP1.1 as follows:-

         "R-LTRP.1.1. The requirements to be met for limited leave to remain
    as a partner are-
         (a) the applicant and their partner must be in the UK;
         (b) the applicant must have made a valid application for limited or
         indefinite leave to remain as a partner; and either
         (c)  (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under Section S-
         LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
             (ii) the applicant meets all of the requirements of Section E-
          LTRP:
         Eligibility for leave to remain as a partner; or
         (d) (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under Section S-
         LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
         (ii) the applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs E-LTRP.1.2-
      1.12. and E-LTRP.2.1.; and
         (iii) paragraph EX.1. applies."

14.  The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain  on  the
    grounds of private life are set out in paragraph  276ADE  as  follows:-



         "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on the
         grounds of private life
         276ADE. The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
         remain on the
         grounds of private life in the UK are that at the date of
         application, the applicant:
         (i) does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in Section S-
         LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. in Appendix FM; and
         (ii) has made a valid application for leave to remain on the
         grounds of private life in the UK; and
         (iii) has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years
         (discounting any period of imprisonment); or
         (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in the
         UK for at least 7 years (discounting any period of imprisonment)
         and it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to leave the
         UK; or
         (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent at
         least half of his life living continuously in the UK (discounting
         any period of imprisonment); or
         (vi) is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in the UK
         for less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but
         has no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the country
         to which he would have to go if required to leave the United
         Kingdom."

15.  The evidence before the  judge  is  slightly  confusing.   Lloyds  Bank
    statements were submitted by the appellant and  he  claimed  that  they
    showed that he was supported by his mother.  The judge records that the
    evidence of the appellant was that his mother supported him "every  now
    and then".  Monies were paid to the appellant in the United Kingdom and
    his mother gave him approximately �150 per  month  and  occasionally  a
    further  �150  towards  the  middle  of  each  month.   The   appellant
    maintained that he would receive at least a total of �350 a month  from
    his mother.  Whilst he had been at university his mother sent him  �550
    per month, but that was reduced to �350 a month made up of roughly  two
    payments of �150.  The difficulty before the judge was that the  Lloyds
    Bank statements which he submitted did  not  show  transfers  from  the
    appellant's mother.  A  payment  was  made  into  the  account  on  4th
    November, 2011 of �350.  Under the heading activity this was  described
    as being, "DEP Sunderland".  The only other two large payments made  in
    around that time were on 23rd December when the activity was  described
    as being "BGC Temp Recruitment L" amounting  to  �133.76  and  on  29th
    December, 2011 "DEP Rye Lane Peckham" �150.  On 11th January, 2012 �165
    was paid into his account which bore  the  activity  "DEP  Sunderland".
    There was a similar entry for 23rd January, 2012  when  �150  was  paid
    into his account.  On 5th March, 2012 �1,950 was paid into the  account
    but this was described as being "TFR J Afolayan" suggesting that it was
    a transfer from another  account  maintained  by  the  appellant.   Two
    further similar entries appeared in March, 2012, one for  �30  and  one
    for �140.  According to a subsequent statement  there  were  five  more
    transfers during March of �360.  Subsequent bank statements  showed  no
    deposits into the account; all subsequent entries appeared to be  as  a
    result of transfers from J Afolayan.  The appellant did have a  Halifax
    account which showed deposits in between 19th March, 2012 and  payments
    out between 8th June, 2012 for �1,000.   Subsequent  movements  on  the
    account showed it being overdrawn from time to time to the extent  that
    by August, 2012 it was overdrawn by more than �390.  The  last  balance
    on 10th September showed the account overdrawn by �290.

16.  There were payslips for the appellant  produced  with  his  application
    and in giving evidence to the First-tier Tribunal Judge claimed to have
    no memory of doing any work  since  the  beginning  of  2013.   At  the
    hearing before the judge the appellant  relied  on  payslips  from  the
    appellant's  spouse  which  the  judge  found  showed  an   income   of
    �14,664.28.

17.  Before  the  Immigration  Judge  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
    withdrew the removal decision under  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

18.  In MM Blake J considered whether the minimum income provisions  of  the
    maintenance Rules when applied to sponsors who are British citizens  or
    refugees whose incomes and savings combined do  not  meet  them  are  a
    disproportionate interference with the  right  to  respect  for  family
    life.  As Mr Kingham pointed out, MM  dealt  with  an  entry  clearance
    application and at paragraphs 122 to 126 Blake J said this:-

          "Justification of interference
         122. I can now finally turn to what I consider the central question
              in  this  challenge,  namely  whether   the   minimum   income
              provisions of the maintenance rules when applied  to  sponsors
              who are British citizens or refugees whose incomes and savings
              combined do not meet them are a disproportionate  interference
              with the right to respect for family life?
         123. Although there may be sound reasons in favour of some  of  the
              individual requirements taken in isolation,  I  conclude  that
              when applied to either recognised refugees or British citizens
              the combination  of  more  than  one  of  the  following  five
              features of the rules to be so onerous in effect as to  be  an
              unjustified and disproportionate interference with  a  genuine
              spousal relationship. In particular that it likely to  be  the
              case where the minimum income requirement is combined with one
              or more than one of the other  requirements  discussed  below.
              The consequences are so excessive in impact as to be beyond  a
              reasonable means of giving effect to the legitimate aim.
         124. The five features are:
            i. The setting of the minimum income level to  be  provided  by
            the sponsor at  above  the  �13,400  level  identified  by  the
            Migration  Advisory  Committee  as   the   lowest   maintenance
            threshold  under  the  benefits   and   net   fiscal   approach
            (Conclusion 5.3). Such a level would  be  close  to  the  adult
            minimum wage for a 40 hour week.  Further  the  claimants  have
            shown through by their experts  that  of  the  422  occupations
            listed in the 2011 UK Earnings Index, only 301 were  above  the
            �18,600 threshold[16].
            ii. The requirement of �16,000 before savings can  be  said  to
            contribute to rectify an income shortfall.
            iii.  The  use  of  a  30  month  period  for  forward   income
            projection, as opposed to a twelve month period that  could  be
            applied in a borderline case of ability to maintain.
            iv. The disregard of even credible  and  reliable  evidence  of
            undertakings of  third  party  support  effected  by  deed  and
            supported by evidence of ability to fund.
            v. The disregard of the spouse's own  earning  capacity  during
            the thirty month period of initial entry.
        125. In reaching my conclusions I understand and have given  weight
            to  the  wide  discretionary  area  of  judgment  open  to  the
            Secretary of State in making economic and social  judgments  in
            the context of immigration. In particular I recognise that  the
            figure of �18,600 was the lower of the two  options  identified
            by  the  Migration  Advisory  Committee  in  their  report  and
            represented the level at which a two person household would  be
            completely ineligible for housing benefit. I  accept  that  the
            policy aim was to identify a figure above mere subsistence  and
            from which future recourse to any form of benefit would be made
            impossible for all practical purposes (thus savings of  �16,000
            excludes a person from any claim to income support). I  further
            recognise that Parliament must have been aware of  the  minimum
            income  figure  when  expressing  its  satisfaction  with   the
            Secretary of State's policies.
        126. Nevertheless, to set the figure significantly higher than even
            the �13,400 gross annual wage effectively denies  young  people
            and many thousands of low-wage earners in full time  employment
            the ability to be joined by their non-EEA spouses  from  abroad
            unless they happen to have wealthy relatives or to have won the
            lottery. This frustrates the  right  of  refugees  and  British
            citizens to live with their chosen partner and found  a  family
            unless such  modest  earnings  could  be  supplemented  by  any
            reasonably substantial savings,  third  party  support  or  the
            future earnings or the spouse seeking admission. The  executive
            can hardly be heard to say that the minimum  adult  wage  is  a
            manifestly inadequate sum to provide a basic standard of living
            over  the  subsistence  threshold  for  a   household   without
            dependent children."
19.  At paragraph 123, the court was  clear  in  finding  that  it  was  the
    combination of one or more of the features set  out  in  paragraph  124
    which made the Rules so onerous as to  be  unjustified  and  amount  to
    disproportionate interference.  In this appeal, of  course,  the  judge
    was not dealing with an entry clearance application, but a variation of
    leave.  He took into account  the  sponsor's  income,  because  despite
    having a third class honours degree, the appellant  had  no  income  at
    all.  He could not recall having worked during 2013 at all and when  he
    did work his most recent employment had been with a company called  Sir
    John Fitzgerald Limited and his gross pay appeared to vary between �145
    per week and, on one occasion �400  per  week.   Whilst  the  appellant
    claimed that his mother supported him, there appeared to be very little
    evidence confirming this in the appellant's own bank statements,  since
    most of the credits into the  appellant's  disclosed  Lloyds  TSB  Bank
    account appeared to be  transfers  from  an  account  maintained  by  J
    Afolayan.  Reference was made by the judge to the  appellant  having  a
    bank account with GT Bank but there appeared to be no  evidence  before
    me of any account with GT Bank.

20.  I have concluded that the judge did not err in law by failing to  apply
    MM and Others.  The five features identified in MM  any  one  of  which
    taken with the minimum income provisions was found  to  be  unjustified
    and disproportionate were not present in this appeal; indeed the  judge
    did take into account the sponsor's own earnings.  The claimed payments
    of cash into his account said to be from his mother and totalling  �350
    per month were not evidenced by the bank statements which  showed  very
    few cash deposits into the account.  The judge did  not  fail  to  take
    into account third party support.

21.  The making of the decision by the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error of law.  His  determination  is  upheld.
    The appellant's appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules and  is
    dismissed on human rights grounds.
