                                     and

               The Secretary of State for the Home Department

Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr H Rasheed of Counsel
                       Instructed by A M Law Associates

For the Respondent:    Mr B O'Leary
                       Home Office Presenting Officer

Paragraph 276B defines 'lawful residence' for the purpose of paragraph 276B
(a).  Where, as here, an appellant has entered the United Kingdom
unlawfully, and has never had any leave to enter or remain since that
entry, he cannot be regarded as accruing 'lawful residence' whilst an
application for leave to remain is pending.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is the reconsideration, with permission granted to the Secretary  of
   State, of the determination of Immigration Judge Moore, who  allowed  the
   appellant's appeal against his refusal of leave to remain under paragraph
   276B of HC 395 (as amended).  The Immigration Judge found as a fact  that
   the appellant had been in the United Kingdom since 1993 (i.e.  less  than
   14 years) but did not believe  his  allegation  that  he  had  originally
   entered lawfully.

2.   Senior   Immigration   Judge   Goldstein   granted    permission    for
   reconsideration because he considered  that  the  Immigration  Judge  had
   arguably erred in law in finding that the appellant could be  treated  as
   lawfully resident, having entered the United Kingdom unlawfully,  because
   of his pending application to regularise his position.

3. The appellant seeks the benefit of the 10-year long residence  rule.   He
   does  not  now  seek  to  come  within  the  14-year  unlawful  residence
   provisions.  In essence, the Secretary of  State  contends  that  as  the
   appellant had not entered the United Kingdom lawfully, his residence here
   remained  unlawful  and  the  10-year  provision  was  not  open  to  the
   Immigration Judge.

4. for the Secretary of State, Mr O'Leary relied on the  letter  of  refusal
   of 18 July 2006, save in relation to the  erroneous  statement  that  the
   Secretary of State has no record of the 1993  or  2001  applications  for
   leave to remain made by the appellant.  That letter, and  the  notice  of
   removal decision which accompany it, 'stop the clock' at  July  2006  for
   the purpose of paragraph 276 and the long residence concession.

5. In submissions for the appellant, Mr Rasheed argued that it was  possible
   to accrue 10 years' continuous lawful residence even where  an  appellant
   had entered the United Kingdom unlawfully.   The  Immigration  Judge  had
   accepted as a fact that the appellant's first settlement application  had
   been pending since February 1993, and in addition, that  he  had  made  a
   subsequent application for indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
   Kingdom in January 2001.

6. Mr Rasheed was unable to produce any authority for the  proposition  that
   a person awaiting the outcome of any application, no matter how  unlawful
   his entry, could be treated as lawfully in the United Kingdom while  that
   application  was  pending.   He  contended  that  further  evidence   was
   available (but not produced or the subject of a counter notice) and asked
   that the appeal be adjourned for second stage reconsideration.

7. I reserved my determination, which I now give. I  now  remind  myself  of
   the relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules  and  the  task  of  the
   tribunal in  considering  reconsiderations.   In  DK  (Serbia)  &  Ors  v
   Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1747,  per
   Latham LJ  -
   "25.   Accordingly, as far as the scope of reconsideration is  concerned,
      the Tribunal is entitled  to  approach  it,  and  to  give  directions
      accordingly,  on  the  basis  that  the  reconsideration  will   first
      determine whether or not there are any identifiable errors of law  and
      will then consider the effect of any  such  error  or  errors  on  the
      original decision. That assessment should prima facie  take  place  on
      the basis of the findings of fact and the conclusions of the  original
      Tribunal, save and in so  far  as  they  have  been  infected  by  the
      identified error or errors of law. If they have not been  infected  by
      any error or errors of law, the Tribunal should only re-visit them  if
      there is new evidence or material which  should  be  received  in  the
      interest  of  justice  and  which  could  affect  those  findings  and
      conclusions or if there  are  other  exceptional  circumstances  which
      justify reopening them...
   1. Whatever decision the  Tribunal  makes  as  to  the  procedure  to  be
      followed  on  reconsideration,  the  parties  will  have   had   their
      opportunity to make submissions. It seems to  me,  however,  that  the
      practice direction quite rightly starts from the assumption  that  the
      reconsideration should be dealt with at one hearing unless good reason
      is shown to the contrary. ...If a party has not filed a  rule  32  (2)
      notice, the Tribunal is entitled to assume that there  is  no  further
      evidence or material it wishes to put  before  the  Tribunal  for  the
      purposes of the reconsideration. And if he has not filed a reply,  the
      Tribunal is entitled to assume that the party other than  the  one  on
      whose application the reconsideration was ordered  does  not  wish  to
      rely on any arguments or material other  than  those  upon  which  the
      original decision was based."

8. Absent any respondent's notice, or indication of what 'further  evidence'
   the appellant has, there is therefore no need for me to adjourn for it to
   be considered. The burden is on the appellant and he has  not  discharged
   it.  the question  therefore  is  a  narrow  one:   can  the  appellant's
   residence while these applications were pending (although we do not  know
   on what basis) amount to 'lawful residence' entitling him to the  benefit
   of the 10-year provision in paragraph 276B.  So far as relevant, the long
   residence requirement of the Immigration Rules is as follows -


      "276B. The requirements to be met by an applicant for indefinite leave
      to remain on the ground of long residence in the United Kingdom are
      that:


      (i)(a) he has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence in the
      United Kingdom; ...and
      (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons why it
      would be undesirable for him to be given indefinite leave to remain on
      the ground of long residence, taking into account his:
     a)  age; and
     b)  strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and
     c)  personal history, including character, conduct, associations and
        employment record; and
     d)  domestic circumstances; and
     e)  previous criminal record and the nature of any offence of which
        the person has been convicted; and
     f) compassionate circumstances; and
     g) any representations received on the person's behalf."

9. There was no documentary  evidence  of  the  1993  application,  but  the
   Presenting Officer acknowledged that the application had been made.   The
   appellant  was  able  to  produce  an  acknowledgment   of   the   second
   application.  The letter of refusal of 18 July 2006 contended that  there
   had been no such applications but the  Immigration  Judge  accepted  that
   there  had,  on  the  basis  of  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer's
   concession and the acknowledgment from the  Secretary  of  State  in  the
   appellant's bundle.

10. If the 1993 application existed, then clearly  there  has  been  a  very
   long delay in processing it.  It is not entirely clear what was the basis
   of that application.  What is clear is that it was not an application for
   asylum (though that was  what  the  appellant  asked  his  solicitors  to
   prepare) as something to do with one of his passport stamps  appeared  to
   his solicitors to give him the  right  to  immediately  claim  indefinite
   leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  It is a pity that we do not  know
   why.  Similarly, the basis of the 2001 application for  indefinite  leave
   to remain in the United Kingdom remains unclear.

11. The  delay  alone  cannot  avail  the  appellant.   In   HB  and  others
   (Ethopia) [2006] EWCA Civ 1713, Buxton LJ summarised the present  law  on
   delay and said, in relation to delay in immigration matters -

      "24.  (v)  Where  the  applicant  has  no   potential   rights   under
      specifically immigration law, and therefore has to rely on his  rights
      under article 8(1), delay in dealing with a previous claim for  asylum
      will be a relevant factor under article 8(2), but it  must  have  very
      substantial effects if it is  to  influence  the  outcome  [Strbac  at
      ï¿½25]."

12. The question is whether the appellant's  mere  presence  in  the  United
   Kingdom with an application of some sort for indefinite leave  to  remain
   pending is enough for 'lawful residence'.  The facts  accepted  are  that
   the appellant was in the United Kingdom in February  2003  and  thus  has
   over 13 years, but less than 14  years'  residence  for  the  purpose  of
   paragraph 276B. The Respondent's letter of  refusal,  by  reason  of  the
   notice of removal decision accompanying it, 'stops  the  clock'  at  July
   2006 for the purpose of paragraph 276 and the long residence  concession.



13. The definition of 'lawfully resident' for the purpose of  rule  276B  is
   set out at paragraph 276A(b) -

   "276A.   For the purposes of paragraphs 276B to 276E:
      ... (b)     "Lawful residence" means residence which is continuous
      residence pursuant to:
           (i) Existing leave to enter or remain; or
           (ii) Temporary admission within section 11 of the 1971 Act where
           leave to enter or remain is subsequently granted; or
           (iii) An exemption from immigration control, including where an
           exemption ceases to apply if it is immediately followed by a
           grant of leave to enter or remain."

14. The appellant cannot comply with subparagraphs (i),  (ii)  or  (iii)  of
   that paragraph, giving the words their natural meaning,  and  Mr  Rasheed
   has not produced any authority  for  the  proposition  that  these  words
   should be given any interpretation  other  than  their  natural  meaning.
   Accordingly, I find that the appellant cannot be regarded as ever  having
   been 'lawfully resident' and that it was  not  open  to  the  Immigration
   Judge to proceed to  consider  the  public  interest  and  other  matters
   pertaining to  the  proportionality  of  allowing  him  to  remain:   the
   appellant simply does not come within the long  residence  concession  at
   all, and his appeal  ought  to  have  been  dismissed.   I  substitute  a
   decision dismissing the appeal.

      DECISION


      The original Tribunal made a material error of law.


      The following decision is accordingly substituted:

     1. The appeal under the Immigration Rules is dismissed, and

     2. The appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.


      Signed
