                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) The appellant appeals against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Scobbie, promulgated on 3 March 2014, dismissing her appeal against
   refusal of entry clearance as the spouse of a recognised refugee  in  the
   UK.  It was acknowledged that  the  case  could  not  succeed  under  the
   Immigration Rules, because the marriage was not  legally  complete  until
   after the sponsor left Afghanistan.  The case was argued on the basis  of
   compelling and compassionate circumstances outwith the Rules.  The  judge
   did not find that such circumstances existed.

2) The appellant and sponsor are both Afghan citizens.  It is common  ground
   that since the sponsor was granted refugee status,  they  have  completed
   their marriage and have spent significant periods  of  time  together  in
   Pakistan.

3) The grounds of appeal and submissions were  along  the  following  lines.
   Firstly, issue was taken with the findings that the  appellant  lives  in
   Pakistan, and that there is no reason why the appellant and sponsor could
   not live together  there.   The  judge  incorrectly  concluded  that  the
   appellant lives in Pakistan, when she has been there only as  a  visitor.
   The matter of the Pakistani address given in  the  application  form  was
   dealt with by the sponsor's evidence during the hearing.  The  judge  did
   not give fair notice of his findings, and had no evidence to justify  his
   conclusions.  He overlooked the submission  that  neither  appellant  nor
   sponsor has any rights of residence in Pakistan.   In  stating  that  the
   sponsor could afford  to  go  to  Pakistan  "...  occasionally,  I  would
   imagine" (�24) he made an unjustified assumption.  Mr Ruddy said that the
   overall sense of the evidence was that the appellant and  sponsor  stayed
   (temporarily) with relatives resident in Pakistan.  His fundamental point
   was that neither of them appeared to have any right of  residence  there.
   The appeal should have been allowed.

4) Mrs Saddiq submitted that the judge was entitled  to  conclude  from  the
   evidence that the appellant did live in Pakistan, which  was  her  stated
   address in her visa application form.  The findings were all justified by
   the information from the appellant and by the  sponsor's  evidence.   The
   matter of the address in Pakistan was specifically addressed  during  the
   oral evidence and in submissions.  There was no error  of  law,  and  the
   determination should stand.

5) The visa application form at Item  3.1  asks  for  the  applicant's  full
   residential address and postal code.  The appellant supplies  an  address
   in Peshawar, Pakistan (although I note it is a "care of" address.)   Item
   3.2 asks how long she has lived there, to which she  replies,  "For  long
   time".

6) In course of submissions the following matters emerged from the notes  of
   proceedings kept on both sides in the First-tier Tribunal.  Neither  side
   suggested that there is any error in those records.

7) Mr Ruddy acknowledged that the sponsor  was  asked  in  cross-examination
   about the address on the form.   His record of the  reply  was,  "It  was
   probably because of my second visit, when I stayed there for 6 months".


8) Mrs Saddiq advised me from the note kept by her colleague that  when  the
   sponsor was asked about the appellant's address, he replied,  "She  meets
   me in Pakistan".


9) It further emerged from Mr Ruddy's note that the sponsor was asked  about
   the appellant having said she had lived at the Pakistan address "for long
   time", and he replied, "We have other family who live in Pakistan".

10) I do not find there to be anything in the  ground  based  on  the  judge
   failing to give fair notice of the issues concerning him.   Issues  about
   the appellant's address and residence  were  plainly  live.   It  is  not
   suggested that there is any further evidence or argument  which  she  was
   denied a fair opportunity of placing before the FtT.

11) The phrase "I would imagine" suggests speculation  and  assumption,  but
   that is to lift it out of context.  The fact is that the sponsor  in  the
   course of a few years made  several  lengthy  visits  to  Pakistan.   The
   conclusion that he is likely to continue to do so is hardly  speculative.
   Rather, it seems to be a very probable forecast.

12) The judge at �21 noted the submission that there was  no  evidence  that
   the parties could live together in Pakistan.  I see nothing wrong in  his
   observation that he was "not so sure  about  this."   On  any  view,  the
   evidence showed at least some scope for living together in Pakistan.  The
   observation at that stage was tentative.

13) The  conclusion  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  at  �23  that  the
   appellant in fact does live in  Pakistan  is  based  on  her  giving  her
   address there and saying she has stayed there for a long time.   Although
   there was some evidence from the sponsor pointing  the  other  way,  that
   appears to me to be a conclusion open to the judge for the reasons given.
     The  conclusion  that  the  sponsor  could  visit  Pakistan  at   least
   occasionally was also well within the scope  of  the  judge.   Any  other
   conclusion would be difficult to reach.

14) At �26 the judge said it was "open to the [sponsor] to  go  to  Pakistan
   if he wishes and it is possible that some form of work could be  arranged
   there".  Matters are more finely  balanced  over  that  conclusion.   The
   judge is not entirely clear whether  it  is  determinative,  or  only  an
   alternative basis  of  decision.   The  determination  suggests  that  he
   thought his overall conclusion justified even on  the  basis  of  ongoing
   visits.  Article 8 is not  a  guarantee  of  a  couple's  right  to  live
   together permanently, in any country, irrespective  of  the  Rules.   The
   point about longer term residence together  in  Pakistan  should  not  be
   assumed to be decisive.  The judge supports his conclusion  about  longer
   term residence by the sponsor himself seeing no good reason why he  might
   not do so and by his having a relative (or relatives) living there.   The
   evidence was of substantial connection with relatives living  permanently
   in Pakistan.  On this point also, I think the conclusion reached was open
   to the judge and that legally adequate reasons are given.  I am  also  of
   the  view  that  it  was  not  crucial  to   the   final   judgement   on
   proportionality.

15) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
