For the respondent:    Mr M Davidson


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator, Mrs N J  Gladstone,
   sitting at Birmingham on 28 April 2003, in which she dismissed an appeal
   against refusal of a husband visa on the basis  that  the  accommodation
   requirement was not met.

2. The accommodation point had been taken by the entry clearance officer in
   the notice of refusal, though on the basis that there was no evidence of
   security of tenure.   This is no longer in issue.  However, the physical
   adequacy of the accommodation was dealt with in a surveyor's  report  by
   Mr J H Brown FRICS,  sent  to  the  entry  clearance  officer  by  those
   representing the appellant.

3. The surveyor described the house in question, which is  a  fairly  small
   three-bedroomed terrace house.  On the ground floor  there  is  what  is
   described as a "through-lounge", measuring 26' x 12', and a kitchen  and
   bathroom.  On the first floor, the first bedroom measures 11'3" x 13'4",
   the second 11'1" x 7'10", and the third 11'1" x 8'3".

4. The adjudicator dealt in some detail with the accommodation requirements
   at paragraph 18:

   In  relation  to  accommodation,  the  documentary  evidence   submitted
   confirms ownership and mortgage payments.  I am aware an expert's report
   is not required to confirm adequacy of accommodation.  As set in Rehman,
   the adequacy must be  assessed  in  the  light  of  the  facts  of  each
   individual case.  The report from the surveyors is dated 23 April  2002.
   The children's ages in that are given as 9, 4�, 2� and 10 months.  These
   do not accord with the ages over a year on given by the sponsor.

   We pause at that point to note that the adjudicator  should  have  dealt
   with the situation as it was at the date of the decision.

5. The adjudicator went on:

   However, I reiterate that regardless of the requirements of the  report,
   there is no evidence  in  relation  to  the  number  of  units  for  the
   property.  In practical terms two adult couples, a ten year old boy  and
   three other children will be sharing a three-bedroomed property.   I  do
   not consider that the through-lounge is adequate in relation to sleeping
   accommodation as it  is  not  self-contained.   It  has  an  open  tread
   staircase leading to the first floor.  It seems also that  there  is  no
   hallway, so access to the kitchen and bathroom on the ground  floor  are
   through that room.  On balance I am not satisfied  that  there  will  be
   adequate accommodation at 62 Chapel Street for  the  appellant  and  his
   sponsor in accordance with the Rules.

6. Leave to appeal was given in general terms.  The grounds of appeal  were
   based on the provisions of the Housing  Act  1985,  to  which  we  shall
   return, and on the decision in Nighat Sultana (19228) (written by Mrs RN
   Mannion) of which we have been presented  with  only  a  brief  summary.
   There is also the authority  referred  to  by  the  adjudicator,  Rehman
   (16671), (written by Mr HJE Latter,  vice-president)  again  in  summary
   only; and a further letter faxed by the surveyor dated 4  June  2003  in
   which he says:

   Having regard to the Section of the Housing  Act  1985  I  consider  the
   accommodation as at the date  of  inspection  to  be  adequate  for  the
   occupant as stated together with the applicant although congested.

   The surveyor gives no reference to the section of  the  Housing  Act  to
   which he refers; nor details of any calculations. This falls well  below
   the standards to be expected of any  professional  expert  witness.   We
   have had to do those calculations ourselves, in  collaboration  with  Mr
   Sheikh and Mr Davidson.

7. The position on the authorities to which we were referred  seems  to  be
   this.  So far as Rehman is concerned, neither the absence  of  a  letter
   from the local authority indicating the lack of overcrowding, nor on the
   other hand evidence  that  there  is  not  going  to  be  any  statutory
   overcrowding, is to be regarded as conclusive in a case  of  this  kind.
   As the Tribunal said, what the appellate authorities are concerned  with
   is "the adequacy of accommodation, which must be assessed in  the  light
   of the facts of each individual case".

8. So far as the Tribunal in Nighat Sultana may  appear  to  be  suggesting
   that any accommodation which was not statutorily overcrowded, and so did
   not give rise to any entitlement to  public  housing,  was  adequate  in
   terms  of  the  Immigration  Rules,   we   prefer   Rehman.    Statutory
   overcrowding, or the lack of it, is certainly a relevant point,  and  we
   do accept that the Housing  Act  may  provide  some  guide  to  what  is
   adequate and what is not.  The relevant provisions are sections 325  and
   326.  However, we bear in mind that that part of the statute goes on, at
   section 327, to impose criminal penalties on the occupier of a  dwelling
   who causes or permits it to be overcrowded.  So in that context, a  high
   degree of certainty was clearly required. In  the  immigration  context,
   however,  the  expression  used  in  the  Rules  is  simply   "adequate"
   accommodation, which we have no doubt was intended  as  a  point  to  be
   assessed on the facts  of  the  individual  case,  first  by  the  entry
   clearance officer and then by the appellate authorities

9. We shall look at the situation in this case as it was at the date of the
   decision, and, since the  entry  clearance  officer  was  not  asked  to
   consider this point, base our views on the ages of the children on those
   given by the surveyor. The two smaller bedrooms in the house in question
   (second and third) are each of 70 sq ft or more, but less than 90 sq ft,
   resulting in a capacity in each case of one grown-up person.   The  only
   practical solution would have been for each of the couples, the  sponsor
   and appellant and the other couple,  to  occupy  one  of  those  smaller
   bedrooms, which would not have been adequate, even in statutory terms.

10. There is then a larger bedroom (the first one mentioned),  which  is  of
   150 sq ft and would therefore have been adequate for two units (grown-up
   persons).  The smallest child, going on the surveyor's evidence, was  at
   the date of decision less than a year old, so did not fall to  be  taken
   into account at all.  On that basis those four small children could  all
   have been put in that bedroom, 11'3" x 13'4" as they would only total 1�
   units in all.

11. Mr Sheikh has very realistically  conceded  that,  in  practical  terms,
   this would not normally have been regarded as an acceptable solution  in
   this country.  The accommodation that he points to  as  being  available
   for the children, or whichever of them could not be accommodated in  the
   larger bedroom, is in the "through lounge".  That is certainly  quite  a
   large room.  The adjudicator gives some of its salient features  in  her
   paragraph 18, which we have quoted.  She says it would not be  adequate,
   as not being self-contained, with an open-tread staircase leading to the
   first floor, and being  in  effect  the  corridor  to  the  kitchen  and
   bathroom.   Those are not statutory requirements.  However, in our view,
   they were points which she was entitled to take into account in deciding
   whether the accommodation as a whole was in fact adequate on  the  facts
   of the individual case.

12. The adjudicator's decision went out before 8 June last  year,  so  there
   is no question of it having to be shown that she was wrong on some point
   of law. Nor does the result depend on anything which she  was  specially
   better-equipped to judge than us, such as the credibility  of  witnesses
   who gave oral evidence.  However, the primary decision in the  case  was
   for the adjudicator.  It is not for us simply to substitute our own view
   of what might or might not have been adequate. We should  only  overrule
   her on the accepted principles relating to any appeal on  the  facts  if
   she can be shown to be clearly wrong.

13. For the reasons which we have given,  which  are  essentially  those  of
   practicality,  the  mistake  which  she  did  make  about  the  date  of
   assessment of the children's ages does not make any real difference, the
   essential point being the one we have quoted about the lounge not  being
   self-contained  as  sleeping  accommodation,  including  its  use  as  a
   passageway to the kitchen and bathroom. It also has  to  be  said  that,
   even if the lounge were to be taken into account, neither of the smaller
   bedrooms is really adequate for a couple, either on a statutory, or,  in
   our view, a common-sense basis. In our view, the adjudicator  cannot  be
   said to have been  clearly  wrong  in  rejecting  the  adequacy  of  the
   accommodation put forward as she did; and it follows  that  although  Mr
   Sheikh has taken an entirely realistic attitude to the  issues  on  this
   appeal, it must be dismissed.

                                                                       [pic]
