For the Appellant:     Mrs Zahoor
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. On 2 April 2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kempton  dismissed  the
       appellant's appeal  against  the  respondent's  decision  of  the  17
       October 2014 refusing to issue a Residence Card in recognition of the
       appellant's entitlement to reside in the United Kingdom on the  basis
       of a retained right of residence on divorce.

    2. The respondent states that the appellant failed to present sufficient
       evidence  to  show  he  qualified  under  Regulation  10(5)  of   the
       Immigration  (European  Economic   area)   Regulations   2006   ('the
       Regulations') by failing to show that his EEA  family  member  was  a
       qualified person at the  point  of  divorce  or  that  the  appellant
       resided with her for at least one year during the marriage in the UK.

Background


    3. At paragraph 19 of the determination the Judge refers  to  a  written
       request having been made by the  appellant's  representative  for  an
       order against the Department of Works and Pensions (DWP) to  disclose
       details of the sponsor's benefits in payment from  the  time  of  the
       separation/divorce. The Judge records that as the sponsor  is  not  a
       party to the proceedings, and would have no notice of such a request,
       no such order could be made as it would be a gross  invasion  of  the
       sponsor's privacy.

    4. The Judge noted the appellant's evidence that  his  former  wife  was
       working at a company named Inventive when they were together and that
       a witness stated he dropped her off  sometimes  at  this  place.  The
       appellant stated that in 2011 his wife became ill with  epilepsy  and
       claimed Disability Living Allowance (DLA) as a result of her  illness
       [20].

    5. The Judge did not dispute the fact the  named  company  existed.  The
       issue was the lack of any  'concrete'  evidence  of  the  appellant's
       former wife's circumstances in the period  up  to  the  divorce.  The
       Judge analyses the evidence from HMRC referring to a  benefits  claim
       and the fact that Employment Support Allowance (ESA) for  the  former
       wife ended from 29 December 2010, meaning the ex-wife would have been
       required from this period to either claim Job Seekers Allowance (JSA)
       or find employment [25].

    6. In paragraphs 26-28 the Judge finds:
           "26.   Accordingly, there is no evidence  of  economic  activity
           from early 2011  onwards.  There  is  no     evidence  that  the
           sponsor was either working or made a fresh claim for  ESA  after
           it was refused at the end of 2010.
           27.    Further evidence could have been obtained to  assist  the
           appellant.  In particular a witness order could have been sought
           to cite the sponsor's brother and  employer  to  give  evidence.
           Other relatives of the couple could have been cited as witnesses
           to give evidence about the sponsor's financial circumstances.
           28.     Regrettably  in  all  the  circumstances,  I   have   no
           alternative but to refuse the appeal again on the basis  of  the
           information before me. However, it may  be  that  the  appellant
           will take legal advice in relation to what now  requires  to  be
           done in order to make a successful application in the future."

    7. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal in the following terms:
           "3.    Arguably the  Judge's  approach  [19]  to  the  issue  of
           whether the Appellant should be  granted  the  order  sought  in
           relation to the DWP records of benefits paid was  wrong.  It  is
           arguable that the judge did not make any clear finding  of  fact
           as to whether or not she  accepted  that  Appellant's  assertion
           that he could not contact his former spouse, or, in  that  event
           consider whether  she  should  exercise  her  powers  under  the
           Procedure  Rules  to  require  the  Respondent  to  provide  the
           information that might be necessary  to  determine  the  appeal,
           even if there was no primary obligation upon the  Respondent  to
           make enquiries of other government departments; Amos [2011] EWCA
           Civ 552 @ para 40-2."

Discussion


    8. The application for disclose was not renewed to the Judge on the day,
       Mrs Zahoor stating to the Upper Tribunal that she just took  it  that
       the statement by Judge Kempton that there was no need to  pursue  the
       disclose application was  the  decision  of  the  court.  No  further
       submissions were made as a result.

    9. In relation to the application for disclosure  the  appellant  relied
       upon  rule  15  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier   Tribunal)
       (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 which states:
           'Summoning  or  citation  of  witnesses  and  orders  to  answer
           questions or produce documents
           15.-
           (1)    On the application of a party or on its  own  initiative,
           the Tribunal may-
                (a)    by summons (or, in Scotland,  citation)  require  any
                person to attend as a witness at a hearing at the  time  and
                place specified in the summons or citation; or
                (b)    order any person to answer any questions  or  produce
                any documents in that person's possession or  control  which
                relate to any issue in the proceedings.
           (2)    A summons or citation under paragraph (1)(a) must-
                (a)    give the person required to attend 14 days' notice of
                the hearing or such  shorter  period  as  the  Tribunal  may
                direct; and
                (b)     where the person is not a party, make provision  for
                the person's necessary expenses of attendance  to  be  paid,
                and state who is to pay them.
           (3)    No person may  be  compelled  to  give  any  evidence  or
           produce any document that the person could not be  compelled  to
           give or produce on a trial of an action in a court of law in the
           part of the United Kingdom  where  the  proceedings  are  to  be
           determined.
           (4)    A summons, citation or order under this rule must-
                (a)    state that the person  on  whom  the  requirement  is
                imposed may apply to the Tribunal to vary or set  aside  the
                summons,  citation  or  order,  if  they  have  not  had  an
                opportunity to object to it; and
                (b)    state the consequences of failure to comply with  the
                summons, citation or order.'

   10. One issue that arises is that the application is made to  compel  the
       DWP to disclose the information. The DWP is a department of State and
       not a person. It was not made out that the DWP has a  separate  legal
       persona in the same way as a limited company. The application did not
       seek the order against any named official of the DWP or the  Minister
       of State. It was not made out that rule 15 which applies to a  person
       and the ability to compel them to provide evidence  can  be  used  to
       compel a government department. Mrs Zahoor accepted  that  it  should
       have been an official of the DWP who was named in the application.

   11. Mrs Zahoor also submitted the tax documents provided at paged M1  and
       M2 of the respondents  bundle  were  incorrect.  This  is  a  witness
       statement provided by a named official of HMRC in relation  to  Anisa
       Razaq,  the  appellants  former  spouse,  in  which   the   following
       information is provided:

|                |benefits.        |               |                |
|2012/13         |No employment    |               |                |

|                |show claim for   |               |                |
|                |benefits.        |               |                |
|2013/14         |No employment    |               |                |
|                |record. Records  |               |                |

|                |benefits.        |               |                |

   12. The appellants claim is not made out as the witness  statement  shows
       the information held in the records of HMRC.  If no  income  tax  was
       paid there will be no record of employment or related  tax  receipts.
       The Judge was entitled to put  weight  upon  this  document  from  an
       official source in the absence of evidence rebutting  the  indication
       the EEA national was not employed until 23 June 2014.

   13. It was also submitted that Ms Razaq was a qualified person exercising
       treaty rights as she was not able to work following the diagnosis  of
       epilepsy. She had worked in 2007 but ceased  work  in  2011.  It  was
       argued Ms Raza was a qualified person as a worker unable to  work  at
       the date of the decree absolute, said to be 18 January 2013.  It  was
       submitted the final finding in paragraph 25 is 'mere speculation'.

   14. The appellant has  failed  to  establish  any  arguable  legal  error
       material to the decision to dismiss the appeal.

   15. If the point in relation to the status of  the  DPW  is  correct  the
       application for disclose was defective and no procedural error arises
       in the decision of the Judge in relation to this matter.   The  Judge
       refers in paragraph 27 to the option available to  the  appellant  of
       calling family members to provide the  required  evidence  which  the
       appellant failed to do. HMRC provided details of the information they
       held to the respondent who disclosed it to the  Tribunal.  The  Judge
       accepted the named company existed but the evidence was that for  the
       majority of the relevant period  there  was  no  record  of  the  EAA
       national having an employment record and to be in receipt of benefits
       and no evidence of the exercise of  treaty  rights  at  the  date  of
       divorce.

   16. There is no evidence of an application  being  made  to  summons  the
       appellant's former wife either.

   17. In Amos v Secretary of State for the Home  Department;  Theophilus  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA  Civ  552  the
       Court of Appeal held that a divorced spouse had to establish that  he
       or she had the  right  of  residence  before  the  question  whether,
       notwithstanding the divorce, the right had been retained  by  Article
       13 of the Citizens Directive could  be  determined.  In  relation  to
       evidential issues, it  must  be  shown  that  the  EEA  national  was
       working, or otherwise exercising Treaty rights, until the termination
       of the marriage.   It  is  accepted  that  if  the  couple  separated
       acrimoniously and have not stayed in touch with each other  that  can
       be difficult.  Lord Justice  Stanley  Burnton  rejected  an  argument
       that, in such a case, the Secretary of State should assist the  third
       country national to obtain the missing information about the divorced
       EEA national.  His Lordship stressed  the  "essentially  adversarial"
       nature of immigration appeals, as opposed to the inquisitorial nature
       of welfare benefits adjudication.  Even in a benefits case, there was
       no authority for the contention that the department concerned  had  a
       duty to obtain information from other government  departments.   Just
       so, in a case under the EEA Regulations, the Home Office could not be
       expected to ask HM Revenue & Customs or the Department for  Work  and
       Pensions whether the EEA national was working or  was  self-employed.
       His Lordship does allude, however, to the possibility of the  non-EEA
       national former spouse asking the Tribunal, on an appeal against  the
       refusal of a permanent residence card, to issue a witness summons for
       the attendance of the EEA national under rule  50  of  the  Procedure
       Rules 2005.  This is a power which  is  very  rarely  exercised,  but
       there is no reason why it should not be in a case such as this.   Tim
       Eicke QC also mentioned the possibility of seeking a direction  under
       rule 45 for  the  Secretary  of  State  to  provide  any  information
       necessary for the determination of  the  appeal.   But  as  the  Home
       Office cannot be forced to obtain information from  other  government
       departments, such a direction would only yield the information  which
       the Home Office happens to have itself, and there might be nothing at
       all on the uncooperative former spouse.

   18. The appellant has failed to establish any legal obligation  upon  the
       Secretary of State for the Home Department, who is  a  party  to  the
       proceedings, to approach the DWP for additional evidence. Mr  McVeety
       also stated that he was unaware if the arrangement between  HMRC  and
       the Home Office, which provides a system for the Home Office to  make
       a limited number of request for  information  held  by  HMRC,  exists
       between the Home Office and DWP. It was also submitted by Mr  McVeety
       that if the appellants had not taken all steps to secure the evidence
       himself there can be no duty upon the Secretary of State for the Home
       Department to help.

   19. It has not been made out that the  statement  by  the  Judge  in  the
       concluding part of paragraph 25 of the decision is  speculative.  The
       evidence shows Ms Razaq was refused ESA meaning she has no income and
       no evidence of exercising treaty rights  unless  she  claims  JSA  or
       works. That is factually correct. It is also noted that DLA is a  non
       means contribution benefit which allows a person to meet  their  care
       and disability needs and still work.

   20. Ms Razaq came off ESA in 2010 creating the need for her to prove  she
       was a genuine jobseeker or had obtained a job.  If no  job  had  been
       secured it was necessary to show there was a reasonable  prospect  of
       employment. No evidence was provided of the same.  If  Ms  Razaq  was
       doing neither of these things, and doing nothing, she could not  show
       she was a qualified  person.  On  the  basis  of  the  evidence  made
       available to the Judge the finding that it  had  not  been  shown  Ms
       Razaq was exercising treaty rights  for  the  relevant  period  is  a
       decision that has been shown to be one reasonable open to  the  Judge
       on the evidence.

   21. The submission in reply by Mrs Zahoor  that  the  application  should
       have been "treated pragmatically" is noted but there is no evidential
       burden upon the DWP to assist, steps could have  been  taken  by  the
       appellant but were not, and the  claim  the  respondent  should  have
       assisted more than she did is not made out.

   22. No legal error material to the decision is  made  out.  The  decision
       shall stand.

Decision

   23. There is no material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's
       decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.

   24. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
