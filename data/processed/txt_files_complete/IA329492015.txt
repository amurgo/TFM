                          AMUDALATA TEMITOPE AMODU
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The Upper Tribunal granted the appellant permission to appeal  against
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge N. M. Paul, who dismissed her
    appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse to issue a residence
    card as the extended family member of an EEA national with reference to
    the Upper Tribunal decision in Sala (EFMs: right of appeal) [2016] UKUT
    0411.

2.    Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt granted permission  in  an  order  dated  21
    December 2017 because the Court of Appeal in Khan v  SSHD  [2017]  EWCA
    Civ 1755 found that Sala was wrongly decided. She was minded to find an
    error of law, set aside the decision and remit the case to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal gave the parties seven days from  the
    date her decision was sent to file  an  objection  to  this  course  of
    action in writing. No objections to this course  of  action  have  been
    received.

3.    The Tribunal finds that the First-tier Tribunal  decision  to  dismiss
    the appeal for want of jurisdiction  in  light  of  Sala  involved  the
    making of an error of law.

4.    The decision is set aside and the  appeal  will  be  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

5.    The hearing listed in the Upper Tribunal on 31 January  2018  will  be
    vacated.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
of law

The decision is set aside and the  appeal  will  be  remitted  for  a  fresh
hearing
