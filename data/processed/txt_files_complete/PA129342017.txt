Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms H Salmon, Central England Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. An anonymity direction has previously been made by the Upper Tribunal.
       For the avoidance of any doubt that direction continues.  Unless and
      until a Tribunal or Court directs otherwise, FN is granted anonymity.
      No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify
      her or any member of her family.  This direction applies amongst
      others to all parties. Failure to comply with this direction could
      lead to contempt of court proceedings.


   2. The appellant is a national of Burundi.  She is the subject of a
      deportation order that was signed on 21st April 2010.  On 17th
      November 2017 the respondent considered representations made on behalf
      of the appellant between April 2013 and September 2017 and rejected
      the appellant's account that she would be at risk upon return to
      Burundi and rejected her claim that her deportation to Burundi would
      be in breach of Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human
      Rights, and would be in breach of her daughter's Article 8 rights. The
      respondent refused to revoke the deportation order.  The appellant's
      appeal against that decision was allowed  on Article 8 ECHR grounds
      only, for the reasons set out in a decision of First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Chapman promulgated on 16th March 2018.  First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Chapman dismissed the appeal on refugee, humanitarian protection
      and Article 2 and 3 grounds.  The respondent was granted permission to
      appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge Dineen on 12th April 2018.


   3. A Rule 24 response was filed on behalf of the appellant and as Upper
      Tribunal Judge Coker noted in her 'error of law' decision, the
      appellant did not seek to challenge the findings made by First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Chapman that she is not entitled to international
      protection.  Upper Tribunal Judge Coker was however satisfied that the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in failing to make adequate findings
      on the Article 8 issues, in particular as to the impact of the
      appellant's deportation, upon her daughter.  The decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Chapman was set aside by Upper Tribunal Judge
      Coker for reasons set out in a decision promulgated on 16th July 2019.
       It was directed that the decision would be remade in the Upper
      Tribunal.


   4. The matter was listed before me on 16th December 2019, and after
      hearing evidence I reserved my decision. I informed the parties that
      my decision would follow in writing. I now give my decision with my
      reasons.


The Background


   5. The appellant arrived in the UK on 10th October 2003 and claimed
      asylum. That claim was refused by the respondent for reasons set out
      in a decision dated 31st October 2003. The appellant's appeal against
      that decision was dismissed for the reasons set out in a decision
      promulgated on 16th February 2004.


   6. The appellant entered into a relationship with a Sudanese national
      ("RA") and there is a child of that relationship ("JA") who was born
      on 4th December 2007.


   7. On 5th January 2009 the appellant was convicted of a number of
      offences at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. For the offence of using a
      false instrument, she was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment. For the
      offence of obtaining pecuniary advantage for self by deception, she
      was given a 15-month sentence of imprisonment. She was also convicted
      of three counts of dishonestly making false representations to make
      gain for self/another or cause loss to other/expose other to risk, for
      which she received two 10-month sentences of imprisonment and one 15-
      month sentence of imprisonment. Each of the sentences of imprisonment
      were to run concurrently.  It is helpful at this point to record the
      sentencing remarks made by His Honour Judge Glenn:


         "... Your dishonesty spanned a significant period, about two years
         and four months, and involves a good deal of money. You earned in
         excess of �45,000. You came to this country illegally and sought
         asylum. You had failed in your initial asylum application and
         apparently exhausted your appeal rights by 2003.

         You got your job by tendering false documents. This sort of
         offending is, your solicitor has already said, indeed very
         prevalent. But not content with the income from that paid
         employment, you also claimed support on the basis that you were
         destitute, and you received a significant amount of benefits in
         response to that claim. And still in September 2008, you were
         denying being in any paid employment at all. That wasn't
         desperation; that was greed. Your dishonesty was sustained. You
         gave no explanation in interview for where the money went nor
         really have you done so today as to where the bulk of this money
         went to.

         I give you full credit for your guilty pleas and I will reduce the
         otherwise appropriate sentences by one third. I take account of the
         fact that you have no convictions. I have taken account of what is
         said in the pre-sentence report. I've no doubt that you worked very
         hard and very well. I've also taken account of the fact that you
         have a young child and plainly have medical problems and I direct
         that the document prepared by Dr Bodah Singh should be sent to the
         prison governor.

         You knew what you were doing was wrong. This wasn't just a case of
         surviving. You had a significant income. The offences are plainly
         so serious that only custody is appropriate. I have considered the
         Court of Appeal authorities....

         I have also had regard to totality because technically the claim
         for the Home Office support would have merited a consecutive
         sentence but to keep the sentences short as I can, I'm going to
         make all the sentences concurrent. On count one the sentence is six
         months imprisonment. On counts two and three, the sentence is 15
         months imprisonment. On counts four and five, the sentence is 10
         months imprisonment. As I've said they are all concurrent...."

   8. In March 2009 the appellant was informed that in light of her
      convictions she is liable to deportation under the Immigration Act
      1971 and may be subject to automatic deportation in accordance with
      s32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007, unless one of the exceptions apply.
      The appellant was invited to set out any reasons she has for believing
      that the exceptions do apply. The appellant responded in April 2009
      and on 21st April 2010 a deportation order was signed against her.
      The appellant was served with the reasons for deportation on 23rd
      April 2010.  The appellant's appeal against that decision was heard by
      Immigration Judge Frankish on 25th June 2010 and dismissed for reasons
      set out in a decision promulgated on 7th July 2010.


   9. At the hearing of that appeal, Immigration Judge Frankish heard
      evidence from the appellant and her partner, RA.  Insofar as the
      appellant claimed that her removal in pursuance of the deportation
      order would breach the United Kingdom's obligations under the refugee
      Convention, Immigration Judge Frankish stated:


         "16. ...So far as asylum is concerned, the appellant relies upon
         the rather speculative suggestion that election violence in
         connection with the election as of today, the date of drafting, is
         such as to place her at risk. Her asylum claim was considered in
         detail on appeal on 16 February 2004 (AS/59039/2003). It was
         accepted that she was a citizen of Burundi but, for the detailed
         reasons given (paragraph 31), she was not credible. The appeal was
         rejected. The 2003 country case of N (Burundi) UKIAT 00065, has
         since dropped off the country guidance list. It dealt with the post-
         war civil situation and found that conditions, although bad, did
         not cross the threshold as to necessitate international
         protection...

         ...

         18.  We were not taken to any new facts, any new political
         developments, any new case law country guidance to suggest that it
         would be wrong to diverge from the previous findings in accordance
         with Devaseelan...... so far as asylum is concerned, we find no
         reason to diverge from the findings in the previous determination
         in accordance with Devaseelan..."

  10. Immigration Judge Frankish also considered the appellant' Article 8
      claim, noting that the human rights of third parties, i.e., the
      appellants partner and daughter, must also be considered.  Immigration
      Judge Frankish concluded, at [27], as follows:


         "The appellant is subject to automatic deportation, having been
         sentenced to more than one year of custody, subject to the
         considerations above. The guidance of EO indicates that the two
         Conventions should be considered first. Having found the appellant
         not to fall under either Convention, however, it is difficult to
         see how a breach of the rules will apply by removal of the
         appellant. She has ties to the UK but would be taking those ties
         with her, certainly the daughter and the husband (actually partner)
         would be free to join her. She came to the UK with no right to do
         so and has derived considerable benefit, largely to which she was
         not entitled. The partnership she has formed and the child she has
         conceived have all taken place in the knowledge that she had no
         right to be in the UK, nor indeed did her partner. It is not
         possible to conclude that there is any breach under the rules by
         reason of automatic deportation."

  11. The appellant remained in the UK unlawfully and made further
      submissions on 21st February 2014, 28th March 2014, 20th August 2015,
      14th August 2017 and 26th September 2017, that were addressed by the
      respondent in the decision to refuse the protection and human rights
      claims, served on 21st November 2017.


The respondent's decision of 21st November 2017


  12. The respondent has set out in the decision, the appellant's
      immigration and offending history.  The respondent refers to the
      sentencing remarks made by His Honour Judge Glenn on 5th February
      2009.  The respondent refers to the claim made by the appellant that
      she will not return to Burundi with her daughter because she has a
      genuine fear of returning to Burundi and it would be unsafe for her
      daughter.  The respondent refers to the adverse credibility findings
      previously by Adjudicator, Mr Coates in the decision promulgated on
      25th February 2004, and rejected the appellant's claim that she would
      be at risk in Burundi due to her father's political profile. The
      respondent concluded that neither the appellant nor her daughter,
      would be at risk upon return due to the appellant's imputed political
      opinion, returning as a single woman or due to a fear of being
      trafficked.


  13. The respondent addressed the Article 8 claim made by the appellant,
      relying upon her relationship with RA, and their daughter who was born
      in the UK. The respondent accepted the appellant has a genuine and
      subsisting relationship with her daughter.  Having considered the
      evidence relied upon by the appellant the respondent concluded that it
      would not be unduly harsh for the appellant's daughter to live in
      Burundi with the appellant should the appellant and her partner decide
      it would be in the child's best interest to do so.  The respondent
      noted the appellant's daughter is likely to experience significant
      emotional upheaval and a sense of loss following the appellant's
      deportation if she were to remain in the UK without the appellant. The
      respondent concluded the appellant's daughter would continue to be
      cared for by her father and would continue to receive assistance and
      support regarding her education and healthcare. The respondent
      concluded that although deportation of the appellant would initially
      have a significant impact on her daughter given the appellant's close
      relationship with her, the appellant's daughter could maintain contact
      with the appellant should she remain in the UK with her father.  The
      respondent concluded the child's day-to-day needs could be provided
      for by her father, and the impact upon the child does not outweigh the
      strong public interest in deportation of the appellant.


  14. The respondent also considered the impact of deportation upon the
      appellant's relationship with RA.  The respondent accepted the
      appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with RA.  The
      respondent accepted the appellant does not live with RA purely due to
      the appellant being provided with NASS support.  The respondent
      concluded the appellant's relationship with RA was formed at a time
      when the appellant was in the UK unlawfully and her immigration status
      was precarious.  The respondent concluded that in any event, it would
      be open for RA to live in Burundi with the appellant.


  15. The respondent did not accept the appellant is socially and culturally
      integrated in the UK and on the evidence available, the respondent
      concluded there are no other very compelling circumstances to
      sufficiently outweigh the significant public interest in the
      appellant's deportation.


  16. The respondent also considered the medical evidence relied upon by the
      appellant and concluded that suitable medical treatment would be
      available to the appellant in Burundi. The respondent concluded that
      the appellant's removal would not be in breach of Article 3 ECHR.
      Having considered the claim made by the appellant, the respondent
      concluded there are no grounds on which to revoke the deportation
      order.


The issue in the appeal


  17. As I have already set out, First-tier Tribunal Judge Chapman dismissed
      the appellant's appeal on refugee, humanitarian protection and Article
      2 and 3 grounds, and as Upper Tribunal Judge Coker noted in her 'error
      of law' decision, the appellant did not seek to challenge those
      findings made by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chapman.  The issue in the
      appeal before me is limited to whether the removal of the appellant in
      pursuance of the deportation order would be in breach of her Article 8
      rights.


  18. At the outset of the hearing before me, Ms Salmon confirmed the
      appellant's case is essentially that the public interest in her
      deportation is outweighed by the appellant's right to a family life,
      taking into account the best interests of the appellant's daughter.
      For his part, Mr Mills confirmed that the respondent accepts the
      appellant's daughter has lived in the UK continuously for at least
      seven years and it would be unduly harsh for her to live in Burundi.
      The respondent's case is that it would not however, be unduly harsh
      for the appellant's daughter to remain in the UK without the
      appellant.


The Law


   19. Section 3(5) of the Immigration Act 1971 provides that a person who
       is not a British citizen is liable to deportation from the United
       Kingdom if inter alia, the Secretary of State deems his deportation
       to be conducive to the public good.  Section 32 of the UK Borders Act
       2007 ("the 2007 Act") defines a foreign criminal, a person not a
       British citizen who is convicted in the UK of an offence and, inter
       alia, sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months.
       Section 32(4) of the 2007 Act sets outs out the clear proposition
       that deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the public
       good. That is a statement of public policy enacted by the
       legislature, which the courts and tribunals are obliged to respect.
       Section 32(5) of the 2007 Act requires the Secretary of State to make
       a deportation order in respect of every foreign criminal, subject to
       the exceptions set out in  section 33.  Insofar as is relevant that
       is:


         "(2)  Exception 1 is where removal of the foreign criminal in
         pursuance of the deportation order would breach-

             (a)  a person's Convention rights, or

             (b)  the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee
         Convention.

         ...

         (7) The application of an exception-

             (a) does not prevent the making of a deportation order;

             (b) results in it being assumed neither that deportation of
             the person concerned is conducive to the public good nor that
             it is not conducive to the public good;

         but section 32(4) applies despite the application of Exception 1 or
    4.".



20. Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 NIAA 2002
    informs the decision making in relation to the application of the
    section 33 exceptions. Section 117A in Part 5A provides that, when a
    court or tribunal is required to determine whether a decision made
    under the Immigration Acts breaches a person's right to respect for
    private and family life under Article 8, and, as a result, would be
    unlawful under section 6 of the HRA 1998, the court, in considering the
    public interest question, must (in particular) have regard to the
    considerations listed in section 117B and, additionally, in cases
    concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, to the considerations
    listed in section 117C.  So far as is material to this appeal, the
    following provisions set out in s117C are relevant:


         "Article 8: additional considerations in  cases  involving  foreign
         criminals

         (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.



         (2) The more serious the offence committed by a  foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3) In the case of a  foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4) Exception 1 applies where-

             (a) C has been lawfully resident in  the  United  Kingdom  for
         most of C's life,

             (b) C is socially and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
         Kingdom, and

             (c)  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5) Exception 2 applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2

         (7)The considerations in subsections (1) to (6)  are  to  be  taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted."

21. The Immigration Rules set out the approach to be followed by the
    Secretary of State where a foreign criminal liable to deportation
    claims that the deportation would be contrary to the United Kingdom's
    obligations under Article 8 ECHR.  So far as relevant to this appeal,
    the immigration rules state:


    Revocation of deportation order

        390. An application for revocation of a deportation order will be
        considered in the light of all the circumstances including the
        following:

           (i) the grounds on which the order was made;

           (ii) any representations made in support of revocation;

           (iii) the interests of the community, including the maintenance
           of an effective immigration control;

           (iv) the interests of the applicant, including any compassionate
           circumstances.

         390A. Where paragraph 398 applies the Secretary of State will
         consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not,
         it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public
         interest in maintaining the deportation order will be outweighed by
         other factors.

         ...

         391A. In other cases, revocation of the order will not normally be
         authorised unless the situation has been materially altered, either
         by a change of circumstances since the order was made, or by fresh
         information coming to light which was not before the appellate
         authorities or the Secretary of State. The passage of time since
         the person was deported may also in itself amount to such a change
         of circumstances as to warrant revocation of the order.

         ...

         396. Where a person is liable to deportation the presumption shall
         be that the public interest requires deportation. It is in the
         public interest to deport where the Secretary of State must make a
         deportation order in accordance with section 32 of the UK Borders
         Act 2007.

         397. A deportation order will not be made if the person's removal
         pursuant to the order would be contrary to the UK's obligations
         under the Refugee Convention or the Human Rights Convention. Where
         deportation would not be contrary to these obligations, it will
         only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in
         deportation is outweighed.

         Deportation and Article 8

         A398. These rules apply where:

             (a) a foreign criminal liable to deportation claims that his
             deportation would be contrary to the United Kingdom's
             obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;

             (b) a foreign criminal applies for a deportation order made
             against him to be revoked.

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
         to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights
         Convention, and

             (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
             the public good and in the public interest because they have
             been convicted of an offence for which they have been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

             (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
             the public good and in the public interest because they have
             been convicted of an offence for which they have been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but
             at least 12 months; or

             (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
             the public good and in the public interest because, in the
             view of the Secretary of State, their offending has caused
             serious harm or they are a persistent offender who shows a
             particular disregard for the law, the Secretary of State in
             assessing that claim will consider whether paragraph 399 or
             399A applies and, if it does not, the public interest in
             deportation will only be outweighed by other factors where
             there are very compelling circumstances over and above those
             described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

        399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c) applies
      if -

             (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
             relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is in
             the UK, and

                (i) the child is a British Citizen; or

                (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least
                the 7 years immediately preceding the date of the
                immigration decision; and in either case

                  (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
                  country to which the person is to be deported; and

                  (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in
                  the UK without the person who is to be deported; or

             (b) the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
             a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled
             in the UK, and

               (i) the relationship was formed at a time when the person
               (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration
               status was not precarious; and

               (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in
               the country to which the person is to be deported, because
               of compelling circumstances over and above those described
               in paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

               (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain in
               the UK without the person who is to be deported.

         399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies
if -

             (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for most
         of his life; and

             (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and



             (c) there would be very significant obstacles to his
             integration into the country to which it is proposed he is
             deported.

   22.    As is apparent, Exception 1 as set out in s117C(4) of the 2002 Act
       replicates the same conditions as those set out in paragraph 399A of
       the Immigration Rules.


The evidence


   23. I have been provided with a bundle comprising of some 184 pages, that
       is relied upon by the appellant. The appellant's evidence is set out
       in section A of that bundle.  Section B has within it, background
       material concerning Burundi, and at section C, there are copies of
       authorities relied upon by the appellant.


   24. I heard oral evidence from the appellant, and RA, Reverend Gaston and
       Mrs Annette Haywood.  I heard submissions made by the party's
       representatives. A full record of the evidence and submissions is set
       out in my record of proceedings and has been carefully considered by
       me in reaching my decision. I have also had regard to the
       respondent's bundle. For the avoidance of any doubt, I have had
       regard to all the evidence whether it is referred to in this decision
       not.


The evidence of the appellant


   25. The appellant adopted her witness statement that is to be found at
       pages 1 to 4 of the appellant's bundle and was signed by the
       appellant on 8th November 2019.  She confirmed that she and her
       daughter have lived apart from RA for about two years and that her
       daughter has now been granted indefinite leave to remain. She
       confirmed that the only reason they live apart is that she remains in
       NASS accommodation and RA is not permitted to stay at the address.
       She confirmed that RA spends a lot of time with their daughter and
       that he takes her to school on his days off, and when she is on
       holiday, he will spend time with her whenever he can, although their
       daughter never stays with him overnight.  The appellant confirmed
       that RA helps out financially by buying any uniform that their
       daughter needs, paying for school meals and for their daughter's
       transport to and from school. He also assists financially when their
       daughter needs clothes, shoes and trainers.


   26. The appellant's evidence is that her daughter has told her she does
       not know how she is going to cope if the appellant is deported, and
       she has been unable to speak to other adults such as her teachers
       about her fears, because feels shameful and is worried that others
       will make fun of her.


   27. The appellant said that the only time she has been apart from her
       daughter was when she was in prison, but at that time, her daughter
       was very young.  The appellant believes that her deportation will
       affect her daughter psychologically, emotionally and mentally.  The
       appellant said that the ongoing uncertainty is affecting her daughter
       who worries a lot. She said that she could not leave her daughter in
       the UK and if she is deported she will take her daughter with her,
       because "... she is my everything ...".  When Ms Salmon asked the
       appellant whether her daughter had said what she wants to do if the
       appellant is deported, the appellant replied that her daughter hadn't
       said anything "... other than she will come with me. She said that
       she cannot stay here without me ...".  The appellant stated that her
       daughter's aspirations for the future are that she would like to be a
       midwife.


   28. In cross-examination, the appellant confirmed that she considers
       herself to remain in a relationship with RA, and since he moved out
       about two years ago, she has been unable to live with him because he
       only has a one bedroom flat. She said that RA had applied for council
       housing, but they could not be accommodated together because the
       appellant has no lawful status in the UK.  She did not know whether
       RA had made any application for two-bedroom accommodation, so that
       their daughter could live with him.  She said that she had not spoken
       to her daughter about the possibility of remaining in the UK with her
       father, because she has said before that she does not want to stay
       with her father and has said that she would go to Burundi with the
       appellant.


   29. The appellant was referred to her witness statement in which she
       confirms that her daughter is a good sensible girl who often acts
       like an older person and tries to protect others.  Mr Mills suggested
       to the appellant that as a capable resilient child, she would be able
       to manage if she had to stay in the United Kingdom with her father.
       The appellant replied that that would not be possible because her
       daughter is so used to her, and as a teenage girl, she needs to have
       her mother around. The appellant acknowledged that her daughter has a
       godmother but said that her godmother would be unable to help because
       she already has grandchildren and a lot of other responsibilities.
       Her evidence was that her daughter can be a private person who does
       not like to share things with other people.  For example she has not
       spoken to her teachers about the possibility of the appellant's
       deportation and has not even discussed her puberty with them.  The
       appellant acknowledged that she herself has spoken to the school, but
       she had not told her daughter about that because she does not want
       her daughter to feel bad about it.


   30. The appellant confirmed that in Burundi she had attended school up to
       secondary education and then worked as a care assistant. She was an
       only child with no siblings and both of her parents passed away.  She
       said that she does not have any communication with any uncles or
       aunts.  She confirmed that she has a maternal uncle and a paternal
       uncle, and one maternal aunt and two paternal aunts, all of whom
       lived in Bujumbura previously.


The evidence of the appellant's partner, RA


   31. The appellant's partner, RA, adopted his witness statement that is to
       be found at pages 9 to 10 of the appellant's bundle and was signed by
       him on 14th November 2019.  He confirmed that he sees his daughter
       approximately two to three days each week and he helps her with her
       homework.  When he is at home at weekends he also takes her to
       church.  He confirmed that he works 12 hour shifts and earns
       �8.25/hour.  He lives in a one-bedroom flat that is rented from
       Wolverhampton City Council..  He confirms that his daughter has never
       stayed at the flat overnight because it only has one bedroom.


   32. His evidence was that life would be very difficult for him if the
       appellant is deported. He said that his daughter is now a teenager
       and needs her mum.  Because of the long hours that he works, he could
       not be around for her all of the time. He described that he leaves
       home to go to work at about 07:15 to 07:30 each morning and returns
       at 20:30 to 20:45 each night.  His evidence was that if his daughter
       were to live with him he would have to bid for accommodation and his
       daughter could not live with him in the one-bedroom flat that he
       currently occupies. He said that he would have to work more hours to
       meet the additional costs that would be associated with his daughter
       living with all the time.


   33. RA said that he has spoken to his daughter about things like bullying
       and about the appellant being deported to Burundi. It makes her very
       anxious.  He said that even when the appellant goes shopping, if his
       daughter is with him, she gets anxious if the appellant has been away
       for too long and will ask him to telephone her mother to see where
       she is.


   34. In cross-examination, RA confirmed that he was granted indefinite
       leave to remain in September 2017, and that was on the basis that
       their daughter had been registered as a British citizen. He said that
       he had been unable to obtain two-bedroom accommodation because his
       daughter lives with her mother and he was told at the time that he
       should get a one-bedroom flat and then register for a two-bedroom
       flat. He confirmed that despite that advice, he had not looked into
       securing a two-bedroom flat.  He said that at the moment he lives
       about 15 to 20 minutes' walk away from the appellant and his
       daughter.  RA confirmed that he had looked after his daughter when
       the appellant was in prison. However she was 8 to 9 months old at the
       time, and he was able to look after her for about eight months.  He
       said that he was able to cope at the time because his daughter was
       very young and that now she is a teenager and needs her mum.  Before
       he had been looking after a toddler, and his daughter is now at a
       very different stage in her life. He explained that, culturally, he
       would not be able to discuss personal issues, such as puberty and
       'dating boyfriends', with his daughter.  He said there is no one else
       he can turn to that could help him discuss those kinds of matters
       with his daughter.  Although there are individuals at the church that
       they attend, those individuals could only provide limited support,
       but he does not know whether there would be anyone willing to sit
       down and discuss personal matters with his daughter.  He accepted
       that he could change and modify the hours that he works, but that
       would not address the problem, because he could not cope with his
       daughter on his own.


The evidence of Reverend Gaston


   35. Reverend Gaston, a vicar in the Parish of Central Wolverhampton also
       gave evidence and adopted his witness statement dated 7th November
       2019.  In cross-examination he said that in his view, RA would have
       difficulty coping with his daughter given her age.  He said that RA
       would be left looking after his daughter at a time when he would also
       have to cope with the appellant being deported and is likely to be
       overwhelmed.  His view is that the impact of the appellant's
       deportation upon her daughter would be, in his words, "astronomic".
       He said that the appellant and her daughter have a very close
       relationship and go everywhere together. The appellant's daughter was
       described by him as an "exceptional child", and he attributes that to
       the role the appellant has played in her daughter's life.  He said
       that the church would always be supportive but would be unable to
       replace the support that is provided by the appellant to her
       daughter. He was unable to say whether other members of the
       congregation could assist when the appellant's daughter requires
       personal support regarding matters that she may feel unable to speak
       to her father about.


The evidence of Annette Haywood


   36. Finally I heard evidence from Mrs Annette Haywood, who is JA's
       godmother and a member of the congregation of the church attended by
       the appellant's daughter. In cross-examination she was asked about
       the support that she could provide if the appellant's daughter was
       living with her father.  She said that the support would be limited
       and no more than the support that is provided at the moment. That is
       because she does not live in the area and is 40 to 50 minutes away by
       car. She could support the appellant's daughter, with matters such as
       puberty, but that would only be by talking to her on the phone, and
       that would obviously not be the same as being available and there,
       when support is needed. Her evidence was that she tries to catch up
       with the appellant every month or two by telephone and she will speak
       to the appellant's daughter if she is around. They see each other
       face-to-face, perhaps once or twice a year for 2 to 3 hours.


The evidence of JA


   37. In the appellant's bundle I also have a statement made by the
       appellant's daughter dated 31st October 2019. I have carefully read
       the content of that statement in which JA describes her mother as the
       person that she is closest to in her life.  She explains that she
       loves her father and sees him each week but cannot stay with him
       because he lives in a one-bedroom flat and there is often no food in
       his home when she visits. She refers to the long hours worked by her
       father, that often prevents her seeing him.  In her statement she
       confirms that she now attends a secondary school that is supportive,
       and she is aware that her mother has spoken to the headteacher about
       what is happening, but she has still not told any of her friends. She
       refers to the difficulties that she would have in speaking to her
       father about changes to her body as she gets older. She describes a
       typical day in her life and says that if she is separated from her
       mother " I think I will stop seeing colour, everything will be black
       and white and dull. When I am with my mum I wake up feeling happy. If
       she was not here I feel heartbroken every single morning. I will
       never be able to understand why my mum has been taken away from me
       and sent to Burundi.".


Other evidence


   38. I have in the appellant's bundle, a letter from the headteacher at St
       Lukes Church of England School dated 18th July 2019.  That letter was
       written at a time when the appellant's daughter was transitioning to
       secondary school.  The letter confirms that the appellant and her
       daughter have a very close relationship and that as JA enters
       puberty, with all the physical, emotional and hormonal changes that
       this brings, she will be looking to her mother. The headteacher
       states that the appellant's daughter is usually a positive child but
       the uncertainty surrounding her mother is having a negative impact
       which in turn is affecting her education and will undoubtedly have a
       negative impact on her progress and future attainment.


The evidence of the independent social worker


   39. I have also been provided with an Independent Social Work report
       prepared by Sarah Edwards, dated 15th October 2019.  Her conclusions
       are summarised in section 2 of her report.  She considers that it is
       in the best interests of JA for her mother to remain in the UK and in
       her opinion, the deportation of the appellant will have a significant
       detrimental impact upon the appellant's daughter. She concludes that
       it is in JA's best interests to remain in the UK with both of her
       parents, rather than face the option of having to choose between one
       of them and either leave the UK with her mum or remain in the UK with
       her dad. She expresses concern that the burden emotionally for JA, if
       she were to remain in the care of her father following deportation of
       her mother, is likely to be excessive and have a significant impact
       on her. There will plainly be an impact upon her emotionally because
       of the limited contact that she would be able to have with her
       mother, and Ms Edwards expresses the opinion that that is likely to
       have a significant detrimental impact towards her emotional well-
       being and stability.  There is also likely to be a financial impact
       if RA has sole responsibility for his daughter.  Ms Edwards refers to
       the care provided by RA in the past but notes that the current
       developmental stage for JA is likely to be more challenging for RA,
       as he himself appears to recognise. Ms Edwards refers to the
       relationship that JA has with her mother, the support that is
       provided, and states that it is clear that the loss of the appellant
       at this crucial stage within JA's life will have an impact upon her.


The parties' submissions


  40. Mr Mills accepts the appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental
      relationship with her daughter and the issue in this appeal is whether
      it would be unduly harsh for the appellant's daughter to remain in the
      UK without the appellant.  He submits that the test requires a degree
      of harshness going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any
      child faced with the deportation of a parent.  He refers to the
      decision of Lord Carnwath in KO (Nigeria),  that the terms of
      Exception 2 in s117C(5) do not require a balancing of the relative
      levels of severity of the offence, other than is inherent in the
      distinction drawn by the section itself by reference to length of
      sentence.  Mr Mills submits there is a close relationship between the
      appellant and her daughter.  The appellant remains in a relationship
      with her partner and he is only absent because of the particular
      circumstances that prevent them living together.  Mr Mills submits the
      appellant and RA enjoy a good relationship and he continues to play a
      full and active role in his daughter's life limited only by his work
      commitments.  There is no evidence that RA is unable to look after his
      daughter and there should be no assumption that the appellant is best
      placed to care for the child.  The reality is that there are single
      fathers who bring up a daughter, and they are perfectly able to cope
      with the demands placed upon them.  There are sources of support like
      teachers, the church family and others such as the godmother, that can
      provide some support and step in and fill a gap when needed.  Mr Mills
      accepts that support will not equate to the care and support that the
      appellant gives, but that is not to say that the effect of the
      appellant's deportation on her daughter would be unduly harsh.  There
      will plainly be an impact upon the appellant's daughter but that in
      itself is not enough.  Here, the evidence points to the appellant's
      daughter being a bright and resilient child.  Mr Mills submits that
      the more competent and capable a child, the harder it is to say that
      it will be unduly harsh.  Mr Mills submits the appellant's daughter is
      better able to cope than other children in the same situation might,
      and the Tribunal is  entitled to work on the basis that, if needed,
      social services would perform their duties under the law.


   41. On behalf of the appellant, Ms Salmon submits that the evidence
       establishes that it would be unduly harsh for the appellant's
       daughter to remain in the UK without the appellant.  She submits RA
       was clearly embarrassed about discussing personal matters regarding
       his daughter and her puberty, and the appellant's absence would mean
       that JA would be unable to discuss matters of a personal nature with
       her father.  Even if she felt able to approach her father, Ms Salmon
       submits RA would be unable to assist her for cultural reasons, and he
       would find it very difficult to seek support from others.


   42. Ms Salmon acknowledges that the deportation of foreign criminals is
       in the public interest and the more serious the offence committed,
       the greater is the public interest in the deportation.  Mrs Salmon
       submits the offences for which the appellant has been convicted are
       not offences involving violence, and that in the end, the appellant
       was in prison for a period of 7� months and that was now over 10
       years ago.  Mrs Salmon submits the appellant has conducted herself
       impeccably since her conviction and release, and the public interest
       in her deportation has reduced with the passage of time.  Ms Salmon
       submits there is no doubt the appellant has a genuine and subsisting
       relationship with her partner and daughter, and with the exception of
       the 7� months that the appellant was apart from her daughter when she
       was in prison, the appellant has been the primary carer of her
       daughter.  She submits the separation of the family and their
       inability to live together is something that has been forced upon
       them, but the appellant is the person that her daughter has the
       closest relationship with.  Her daughter is now aged 12, has started
       secondary school and is at a critical stage of her physical and
       educational development. There is no-one else that the appellant's
       daughter can meaningfully turn to, particularly when matters such as
       puberty and relationships arise.  Mrs Salmon submits the loss of the
       support from her mother will have a profound effect upon the
       appellant's daughter and as the independent social worker has said,
       the appellant's daughter would be left having to choose between
       leaving the UK with her mother or remaining in the UK with her
       father.  The independent social worker refers to the added pressure
       that the appellant's daughter would have, worrying about her mum
       which will have a detrimental impact upon her.


   43.  The appellant's daughter has set out in her own words how she would
       feel, and Mrs Salmon submits, this is an excessively oblique position
       for a 12-year-old girl to find herself in.  There will inevitably be
       an impact upon RA too.  He has previously looked after his daughter
       when the appellant was in prison but, as he acknowledges, that was
       when his daughter was a toddler, and she is now at a very different
       stage in her life and development.  Although it might be possible for
       him to adjust his working hours, there are likely to be financial
       implications as noted by the social worker. Mrs Salmon submits the
       evidence establishes that the effect of the appellant's deportation
       on her daughter in particular, would be unduly harsh.


Decision and Reasons


   44. The respondent accepts the appellant is in a genuine and subsisting
       relationship with RA, but he is not a "qualifying partner".  He is
       neither a British citizen nor settled in the United Kingdom.  In
       determining for the purposes of section 117C(5) whether the effect of
       the appellant's deportation on the child would be unduly harsh, I
       look at the position on the basis that the appellant's daughter would
       remain in the UK with her father.  The respondent accepts the
       appellant's daughter has lived in the UK continuously for at least
       seven years and it would be unduly harsh for her to live in Burundi.
       There is however nothing preventing the appellant's daughter living
       with the appellant in Burundi, if that is the choice that is made by
       the family.


   45. I have carefully considered the matters set out in the report of
       Sarah Edwards, the independent social worker.  She expresses the
       opinion that even with a planned transition for the appellant and her
       daughter, there is likely to be an impact upon the appellant's
       daughter and the process of forced deportation and removal, will
       continue to have an impact upon her. She confirms that if the
       appellant's daughter remains in the UK, she would have the added
       pressure of worrying about her mother which will have a detrimental
       impact upon her.  She expresses the opinion that if the appellant
       were to be deported, and her daughter were to remain within the UK,
       RA will have to fulfil the supportive role the appellant plays in her
       daughter's education, whilst also completing his full-time job within
       a challenging environment. Her overall conclusion is that it is in
       the best interests of the appellant's daughter for her to remain
       living in the UK with both of her parents, rather than face the
       option of having to choose between one of them, and either leave the
       UK with her mum or remain in the UK with her dad.  She notes the
       appellant's daughter is likely to lose day-to-day contact with one of
       her care givers given the constraints of either of her parents to be
       able to contact the other regularly, and this is likely to have an
       impact upon how she is able to experience and consider one aspect of
       her culture.  She recognises that remaining in the UK is likely to be
       of greater benefit to JA than moving to live in Burundi.  By
       remaining in the UK she will benefit from stability, possible
       security and educational prospects, but the impact upon the family
       emotionally and the limited contact that JA would be able to have
       with her mother, is likely to have a significant detrimental impact
       towards her emotional well-being and stability.


   46. Having carefully considered the evidence before me, I am satisfied
       that there is an extremely close bond between the appellant and her
       daughter.  That is plainly apparent from the report of the
       independent social worker and has been confirmed by each of the
       witnesses that gave evidence before me.  I am also quite satisfied
       that apart from the period during which the appellant was
       incarcerated for a period of about 7� months, the appellant's
       daughter has lived with the appellant.  I find that the appellant
       lived with her daughter and RA until September 2017, when RA moved
       into his own accommodation after he was granted leave to remain in
       the UK.  I accept that the separate living arrangements have been
       caused by the circumstances that the appellant and RA find themselves
       in, and that the appellant and RA have always played an important
       part in the life of JA.  Despite the current living arrangements, RA
       continues to play a positive role in his daughter's life, maintaining
       regular contact with his daughter, helping with school-work and other
       activities, and making a positive emotional and financial
       contribution whenever he is able to do so.  The evidence of the
       appellant, RA and indeed their daughter confirms the relationship
       that RA has with his daughter is a good one and having heard RA give
       evidence, I am satisfied that he will do whatever he can to assist
       his daughter and would be quite prepared to care for his daughter
       notwithstanding the challenges that that would bring.  He would be
       able to make arrangements for her accommodation with him and he would
       be able to make adjustments to his working pattern so that he is
       available to care for his daughter.  He already assists his daughter
       with her homework, ensures that she is able to attend church
       regularly and buys her what she needs.


   47. It would in my judgement undoubtedly be in the best interests of the
       appellant's daughter to continue to live with both of her parents
       together in the UK.  I acknowledge that the best interests of the
       child are a primary factor in my ultimate decision, however it is not
       the determinative factor.


   48. I have no reason to doubt the evidence given by Reverend Gaston that
       the appellant and her daughter have a very close relationship and the
       deportation of the appellant will have a significant impact upon her
       daughter.  I also accept his evidence that RA would have difficulty
       coping with his daughter given her age.  His evidence is consistent
       with the opinions expressed by the independent social worker.
       However, the difficulties that RA will undoubtedly encounter, are
       much the same as the difficulties that any single parent would
       encounter when dealing with adolescence and the transitional phase of
       growth and development between childhood and adulthood.  The
       appellant's daughter will undoubtedly require some support regarding
       her emotional and physical development and although I accept that
       relying upon the support of others is not the same as the support
       that the appellant could provide to her daughter, there is
       nevertheless some wider support available to the appellant's daughter
       from her teachers, the church community and her godmother.


   49. I must take into account the Article 8 rights of the appellant, RA
       and their daughter and the public interest in deportation as
       expressed in the immigration rules and s117C of the 2002 Act.  I have
       carefully considered whether there is anything within the evidence
       and in particular, the report of the independent social worker, that
       establishes a degree of harshness going beyond what would necessarily
       be involved for any child faced with the deportation of a parent
       reminding myself that it is an elevated threshold denoting something
       severe or bleak to be evaluated exclusively from the effect on the
       child.  Having carefully considered the evidence, in my judgment
       there simply is not the evidence on which I can properly conclude
       that the deportation of the appellant would lead to her daughter
       suffering a degree of harshness beyond what would necessarily be
       involved for any child of a foreign criminal facing deportation. I
       have no doubt that the appellant's daughter will initially feel a
       sense of loss because of her close relationship with her mother.
       That is apparent from the moving terms in which the appellant's
       daughter describes how she would feel if the appellant was required
       to leave the UK.  I have no doubt that the consequences of the
       appellant's deportation will be harsh.  The evidence establishes that
       the appellant's daughter is bright and resilient and has had a
       successful transition into secondary school.  The 'commonplace'
       distress caused by separation from a parent is insufficient to meet
       the test.  The appellant's daughter will continue to receive the
       love, care and support that she needs from her father in the United
       Kingdom.


   50. I accept the opinion of the independent social worker that reliance
       upon modern means of communication is no substitute for physical
       presence and face-to-face contact. However, I do not believe that in
       the event of the appellant's deportation, such face-to-face contact
       would not be possible. The appellant's daughter has expressed a
       willingness to travel to Burundi to be with her mother and there is
       nothing in the evidence before me to establish that some, albeit
       limited, face to face contact would not be possible from time to
       time.  It would in my judgement be entirely possible for the
       appellant to see both her partner and daughter in Burundi during
       visits and to maintain regular communication in between.


   51. The appellant's deportation will undoubtedly mean that RA will have
       to arrange suitable accommodation and make changes to his work
       pattern. It will undoubtedly be difficult for RA and the appellant's
       daughter in the short term, but in my judgment the evidence simply
       does not provide a basis upon which the appellant can establish
       Exception 2 under s.117C(5) of the 2002 Act and paragraph 399 of the
       Immigration Rules.


   52. In NA (Pakistan) -v- SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 662, Lord Justice Jackson
       held that the fall back protection set out in s117C(6) also avails
       those who fall outside Exceptions 1 and 2 and that on a proper
       construction of section 117C(3), the public interest requires the
       person's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies or
       unless there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those
       described in Exceptions 1 and 2.  As to the meaning of "very
       compelling circumstances" over and above those described in
       Exceptions 1 and 2, Lord Justice Jackson said:


          "28.    ... The new para. 398 uses the same language as section
          117C(6) . It refers to "very compelling circumstances, over and
          above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A." Paragraphs 399
          and 399A of the 2014 rules refer to the same subject matter as
          Exceptions 1 and 2 in section 117C , but they do so in greater
          detail.

          29. In our view, the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in JZ
          (Zambia) applies to those provisions. The phrase used in section
          117C(6) , in para. 398 of the 2014 rules and which we have held is
          to be read into section 117C(3) does not mean that a foreign
          criminal facing deportation is altogether disentitled from seeking
          to rely on matters falling within the scope of the circumstances
          described in Exceptions 1 and 2 when seeking to contend that
          "there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those
          described in Exceptions 1 and 2". As we have indicated above, a
          foreign criminal is entitled to rely upon such matters, but he
          would need to be able to point to features of his case of a kind
          mentioned in Exceptions 1 and 2 (and in paras. 399 or 399A of the
          2014 rules), or features falling outside the circumstances
          described in those Exceptions and those paragraphs, which made his
          claim based on Article 8 especially strong.

   53. Whether there are "very compelling circumstances" is a demanding
       test, but nonetheless requires a wide-ranging assessment, so as to
       ensure that Part 5A produces a result compatible with Article 8.


   54. I have noted the appellant's offending history and have set out the
       sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge Glenn following the
       appellant's convictions in January 2009.  I accept the appellant was
       not convicted of a crime of violence, and I note that the appellant's
       sentence of imprisonment is at the bottom of the range covered by
       section 117C(3).  That however does not undermine the seriousness of
       her offending reflected in the sentencing remarks and the sentence of
       imprisonment imposed.  I also accept the appellant has not offended
       again, but she has been the subject of a deportation order since
       April 2010 and has failed to leave the UK despite an appeal having
       been dismissed in July 2010, in which her human rights claim was
       considered by the Tribunal. She arrived in the UK and made a claim
       for asylum in October 2003 that was swiftly refused by the respondent
       and an appeal against that decision was dismissed in February 2004.


   55. The best interests of the appellant's daughter certainly carry great
       weight because of the passage of time, nevertheless, it is a
       consequence of criminal conduct that an offender may be separated
       from their child for many years, contrary to the best interests of
       the child.  The desirability of children being with both parents is a
       commonplace of family life. That is not usually a sufficiently
       compelling circumstance to outweigh the high public interest in
       deporting foreign criminals. As Rafferty LJ observed in SSHD -v- CT
       (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 488 at [38]:


           "Neither the British nationality of the respondent's children
           nor their likely separation from their father for a long time
           are exceptional circumstances which outweigh the public interest
           in his deportation."

   56. I acknowledge that the public interest in the deportation of a
       foreign criminal is not set in stone and must be approached flexibly,
       recognising that there will be cases where the person's circumstances
       outweigh the strong public interest in removal.  I have had regard
       inter alia to the appellant's length of residence in the UK, the
       close ties that she retains with her partner and daughter, her
       immigration and offending history, and the family circumstances
       described in the report of the independent social worker.  However,
       there are in my judgment no very compelling circumstances which make
       her claim based on Article 8 especially strong.  It follows that in
       my judgement, the deportation of the appellant is in the public
       interest and not disproportionate to the legitimate aim.


Decision


  57. I dismiss the appeal.
