Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1.  The  Appellant  is  a  citizen  of  India  who  appealed  against  the
    Respondent's decision of 24th November 2014  to  refuse  to  grant  him
    leave to remain here as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  A  subsequent
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal Judge Whiltcombe was dismissed  in  a
    decision promulgated on 17th June 2015.  Grounds  of  application  were
    lodged.  A summary of the grounds is presented on page 1 of the grounds
    and I repeat them here:-

         "(a)     The FtTJ's erred in law by  not  considering  IR  and  its
             mandatory requirements for T-1(E) visa and  wrongly  concluded
             that the date of start of business undermined  seriousness  of
             the business venture, however there is no such requirement  in
             the relevant IR's;

         (b) The FtTJ has cited many  reasons  for  refusal  by  identifying
             those requirements as mandatory/quasi mandatory for there  are
             no  such  mandatory/quasi  mandatory   requirements   in   the
             Immigration Rules, policy guidance  or  even  in  any  of  the
             documents of Home Office in public domain;

         (c)   The  FTJ's  failure  to  consider  the   published   guidance
             describing interview procedure before conducting an  interview
             and Respondent's failure to abide by it;

         (d)  FtTJ's failure to consider the business venture is by  a  team
             and there is another person in the team who is responsible for
             business  strategies  and  A  is  only  responsible  for   the
             Marketing and HR aspect of the business;

         (e)  The FTJ failed  to  consider  Shebl  (Entrepreneur:  proof  of
             contracts) [2014] UKUT 216 (IAC) especially accepting that the
             contracts entered by A's company to be genuine."

 2. The grounds then go on to elaborate on these points.

 3. Permission to appeal was initially refused on the basis that there  was
    no arguable error of law but in the grounds' further points  were  made
    to the Upper Tribunal and permission granted by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Reeds.

 4. Judge Reeds pointed out that the business partner's appeal was heard on
    the day before the Appellant's but no attempt was made for the  appeals
    to be heard  together  despite  the  fact  that  information  would  be
    relevant  to  both  appeals.   The  Appellant's  business  partner  was
    successful in his appeal and as the decision in  MM  (Unfairness:  E&R)
    Sudan [2014] UKUT demonstrated, an error of  law  may  be  found  where
    material evidence was not considered and thus it is arguable that there
    was relevant evidence relating to the business  partner  available  and
    also that had it been taken into account it  may  have  resulted  in  a
    different outcome.

 5. It was also said that the other grounds were also arguable.

 6. A Rule 24 notice was lodged. It was submitted inter alia that the judge
    directed himself appropriately.  For example, it was submitted that the
    Appellant's complaint that it was irrational for the judge to take into
    account  the  Appellant's  other  employment  was  without  merit.   In
    considering genuineness under 245DD(h)(iv) the Secretary of State  must
    be satisfied that the Appellant will not take employment other than the
    terms of paragraph 245DE. That issue  was  raised  in  the  RFRL.   The
    judge's findings were reasoned.  The  Appellant's  complaint  that  the
    judge failed to consider and apply  245AA  was  wholly  without  merit.
    245AA is specific to "specified documents", the discretion  to  request
    further evidence at the date of decision is found under Rule 245DD(j).

 7. There was no duty on the Secretary of State to request post-application
    evidence. The Appellant's complaint that he was not asked  for  further
    evidence to rebut issues arising from his interview fails to  recognise
    the terms of the discretion under rule  245DD(j)  and  ignores  Section
    85A(4) and the reasoning in Ahmad.

 8. Thus the matter came before me on the above date.

Submissions

 9. The first complaint from Mr Karim was that the judge had made  findings
    on the Appellant's oral evidence which should  not  have  been  allowed
    given that this was a points-based system case - see Ahmed and  Another
    (PBS: admissible evidence)  [2014]  UKUT  00365  (IAC).   There  was  a
    prohibition in relation to new evidence.

10. Secondly, the judge had looked at  circumstances  as  at  the  date  of
    hearing which was well beyond  the  date  of  decision  taken  on  20th
    November 2014.  He had therefore erred in law.

11. The decision of the business partner was heard before the appeal of the
    Appellant and the judge had  failed  to  take  into  account  that  the
    application was from a team, and not just the Appellant.  This was  the
    most important error.

12. Thirdly, prior to refusal of the application, the  Secretary  of  State
    should have provided the Appellant with an  opportunity  to  deal  with
    points of concern and this was a breach of the common law obligation of
    fairness.

13. In terms of Article 8, reliance was placed on  the  grounds.   Firstly,
    there was a prohibition on hearing oral  evidence.  Secondly,  although
    the judge may not have been at  fault  in  not  having  regard  to  the
    position of the business partner, there was a material error of  law  -
    reliance was placed on MM (Unfairness; E&R)  Sudan  [2014]  UKUT  00105
    (IAC).

14. In response to observations from the Home Office Mr Karim referred to a
    bank statements in the Appellant's bundle which did  suggest,  contrary
    to the judge's findings at paragraph 39 that money had  been  spent  on
    business development etc.; the bank statements showed  that  there  had
    been transactions. There were therefore errors of law in  the  decision
    and the matter would have to be reheard at First-tier Tribunal level.

15. For the Home Office it was said that the judge had given cogent reasons
    for not accepting the Appellant's account.

16. It was the responsibility of the Appellant's representatives to present
    the evidence of the Appellant's  business  partner.   They  could  have
    asked that the cases be linked or adjourned but there was no submission
    that this had been  done.

17. The facts in MM were fundamentally different to  the  case  before  me.
    Various principles were set out in that case to allow  evidence  to  be
    admitted, part of which was that a  procedural  failure  caused  by  an
    Appellant's own representative did not  lead  to  an  appeal  being  in
    breach of the Rules of natural justice - see  paragraph  25.   In  this
    case there had been a failing by  the  representatives  to  adjourn  or
    conjoin the two cases.

18. There was no procedural unfairness. There was no duty on the  Secretary
    of State to request further information from the Appellant.

19. There being no error of law the appeal should be dismissed.

20. I reserved my decision.

Conclusions

21. The judge found that the timing of  the  incorporation  undermined  the
    contention that it was a serious  business  venture  and  he  therefore
    looked closely at the evidence that it was trading  and  developing  as
    might be expected of a genuine business (paragraph 20). The judge noted
    at paragraph 24 that it became  clear  in  cross-examination  that  the
    Appellant's involvement in "talent hunt" was  limited  to  interviewing
    applicants for employment shortlisted by Costa Coffees  HR  department.
    The  Appellant  accepted  in  cross-examination  that  he   interviewed
    applicants for employment about six times a year and the judge  made  a
    finding  that  his  involvement  with  training  and  recruitment   was
    extremely limited.  He noted that neither the Appellant nor Mr D  Patel
    (his business partner) had left their employment  in  order  to  commit
    their time wholly to the business "Start 2 End Solutions Limited".   He
    found that this undermined the contention that "Start 2  End  Solutions
    Limited" was a genuine business.

22. The judge  observed  that  he  had  had  heard  no  evidence  that  the
    Appellant's degree gave  him  any  expertise  in  his  human  resources
    planning.  He noted that Mr D Patel's  specialism  would  be  "business
    strategy, IT and business procedure" but pointed out he had  not  heard
    any evidence which substantiated his expertise in those areas.

23. He went on to note that the business had one client. He pointed out  in
    paragraph 31 that it was the commercial substance of the contract which
    was questionable, not its legality or enforceability.   He  noted  that
    the Appellant had struggled to describe  precisely  what  services  his
    business had performed for Mr N Patel and went on to say that a genuine
    start-up business would seek  more  than  one  contract  with  a  small
    convenience store (paragraph 35).

24. He noted that the business was advertised  on  the  well-known  Gumtree
    classified ads website and it had approximately 150 views. That, in the
    judge's assessment, was a very small number even for a genuine start-up
    business.

25. He noted that the advertisement contained numerous grammatical errors.

26. In terms of the investment by the Appellant of  �50,000  he  said  that
    "not a single penny" had been spent on  business  development  etc."  I
    interpose here that prima facie the bank statements referred to do  not
    show that money had been spent on business development.   The judge was
    critical of the  financial projections given that the Appellant said he
    expected his company to turn over �1,000 to �3,000 in its next year  of
    trading and he noted why the projections contained no specific  targets
    for productions which the Appellant was not able to  answer.   For  all
    the reasons given the judge found that the business plans were  neither
    viable nor credible.

27. It cannot be said that any of these findings are perverse or irrational
    or were not conclusions the judge was entitled to make except  that  he
    did consider matters at the date of the hearing as opposed to  what  he
    should have done, the  date  of  decision  dated  24th  November  2014.
    However it does not seem to me that this had a material bearing on  the
    outcome on the appeal  nor  was  it  submitted  that  it  did;  in  the
    circumstances it does not constitute a material error in law.

28. Mr Karim relied on Ahmed for the proposition that the judge should  not
    have taken into account oral evidence given by the Appellant.  That  is
    not an attractive proposition particularly  given  that  the  Appellant
    elected to give evidence which of course most applicants do, as if they
    did not their appeal would probably  fail  for  reasons  given  in  the
    refusal letter.  It is also a misunderstanding of Ahmed - that decision
    does not say that oral evidence given by an Appellant may not be  taken
    into account but rather there is  a  prohibition  in  relation  to  new
    evidence - an  entirely  different  proposition.  It  is  difficult  to
    understand the merit of a submission when a decision is taken  to  lead
    an Appellant in evidence and then to complain when the  Tribunal  takes
    account of what the Appellant has said.   I find that the reasoning  in
    Ahmed does not assist the Appellant.

29. Secondly, while it was said that the judge was not  at  fault  for  not
    considering the position of the business partner  it  was  nevertheless
    argued that there was an error in law conform to what was  said  in  MM
    and indeed that this was the most important error.   In  my  view  this
    submission is unsound.  It was for  the  Appellant  through  his  legal
    advisors to decide how to  deal  with  the  evidence  of  the  business
    partner. On the face of it these appeals could have  been  consolidated
    in that the Tribunal could have been invited to hear them on  the  same
    day before the same judge. Certainly, with the benefit of legal advice,
    the Appellant could readily have made such a motion to that  effect  or
    move that the  case  should  be  adjourned  or  alternatively  led  the
    business partner, Mr Patel, in evidence. None of these steps were taken
    and Mr Karim had no explanation as to why not. The  facts  in  MM  were
    very different to the facts in this case  and  in  this  case,  as  put
    forward  by  the  Home  Office,  the  Appellant  or  his  advisor  were
    responsible for the apparent mistake (if that is  what  it  was)  which
    arose in proceeding with the case in the  absence  of  the  Appellant's
    business partner.  As noted above, the jurisprudence  establishes  that
    the procedural failure caused by the Appellant's  representatives  does
    not lead to an appeal being in breach of the Rules of natural justice.

30. No doubt some judges would have raised this issue with the  Appellant's
    agents at the commencement of the hearing but there was  no  obligation
    on the judge to do that and he did not. It may be, of course and in the
    absence of any explanation to the contrary that it was a deliberate and
    measured decision by the Agents not to involve the business partner  in
    this appeal but for whatever reason (none was forthcoming) that  was  a
    matter for them.  There is no merit in this ground of appeal.

31. In these circumstances there was no breach of the common  law  duty  of
    fairness to the Appellant. There is no authority which  says  that  the
    Secretary of State is obliged to return to the Appellant in  the  event
    that that they had concerns on the merits of his application. There  is
    no breach of Rule 245AA.

32. In all these circumstances there is no error of  law  in  the  decision
    which must stand.  There is no need for an anonymity order.

Notice of Decision

33. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

34. I do not set aside the decision.
