Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of  Mr  Abubakkar  Sanugondla  brought  against  the
    decision of Judge Symes following a determination made on the papers at
    Richmond on 4th February 2016.

 2. In his determination, the judge set out the immigration history of  the
    appellant.

 3. He was granted leave to enter as a student from 22nd January  2006  and
    again  on  28th  June  2007,  receiving  extensions  of  leave  in  the
    international graduate scheme  until  16th  July  2009.   He  was  then
    granted leave to enter as a post-study migrant on 11th July 2009  until
    16th July 2010, by which time he had made a further  application  under
    Tier 1, on 29th March 2010 which was refused with no right of appeal on
    11th June 2010.

 4. A further application was again refused, including on the grounds  that
    the appellant had submitted a false document, but subsequently  allowed
    on appeal, in July 2012, by Immigration Judge Mailer.  Leave  was  then
    granted from 10th January 2013 until 10th January 2015.

 5. Immigration Judge Symes said that the application for further leave  to
    remain, leading to the appeal before him, was refused  because  he  had
    previously relied in his applications from 2010 on an MBA qualification
    evidenced by a  certificate  from  Andhra  University  which  had  been
    verified as not genuine. The appellant had nevertheless claimed in  the
    present application that he had never used deception  in  any  previous
    application.   He  had  therefore  not  disclosed  a   previous   false
    representation and his  application  fell  to  be  refused  under  Rule
    322(1)(a) and 322(2).

 6. The judge set out Rule 322(2) and said that the  respondent  had  fully
    evidenced the underlying enquiry which led to her conclusion  that  the
    application for leave to remain was without merit and no contrary  case
    had been put by the appellant.  He concluded that  the  respondent  had
    discharged the burden of proof  upon  her  to  demonstrate  that  false
    representations had been made, and dismissed the appeal.

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal which was  granted  by  Judge
    Holmes on 15th December 2016.  Judge Holmes said that it  was  arguable
    that the judge had overlooked the content of documents,  filed  by  the
    appellant on 21st October 2015, which were on  the  Tribunal  file,  to
    which no reference was made.  They were  relevant  to  the  appellant's
    explanation for what had occurred  in  previous  applications  and  his
    evidence that he was not guilty of any deception.

 8. I have checked the file but I cannot find the documents to which  Judge
    Holmes was referring.  Nevertheless they clearly were there.

 9. At the hearing Mr Sanugondla  provided  the  determination  from  Judge
    Mailer, promulgated on 23rd July 2012.

10. Judge Mailer said at paragraph 4 of the determination

      a) "At the hearing on  1st  June  2012  Mr  Colombo,  (the  Presenting
         Officer), at the outset stated that he was not  seeking  to  uphold
         the respondent's refusal on that  ground.   No  evidence  has  been
         submitted.  Accordingly the respondent has failed to discharge  the
         burden of proof resting on her on the balance of probabilities.

11. Mr Tufan sensibly acknowledged that this determination  made  it  clear
    that there was no basis upon which he  could  argue  that  the  refusal
    under paragraph 320 should stand.   He  simply  observed  that  it  was
    probably not before the decision-maker.

12. Be that as it may, the judge clearly erred in law. He either failed  to
    have regard to relevant evidence in the file before him or, if  due  to
    administrative error it was not, by making a mistake  of  fact.  It  is
    quite clear that from 2012, the respondent  was  no  longer  making  an
    allegation of deception.

13. The determination is therefore set aside.

14. Mr Tufan did not seek to argue anything other than the appeal ought  to
    be allowed.  The following decision is therefore substituted.

15. The appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision
