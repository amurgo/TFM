                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr F Abe, Legal representative, Atlantic, Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Miss J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are all citizens of Nigeria who applied  on  11th  April
    2014 for leave to remain under the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) route.

 2.  The  Respondent  refused  the  application  on  13th  May  2014.   The
    subsequent appeal to First-tier Tribunal Judge Oliver was allowed in  a
    determination promulgated on 8th October 2014.

 3. The judge noted that the respondent refused the application on 13th May
    2014 because the evidence submitted of his access to �55,000  in  funds
    showed that the money was already in an account in  the  name  of  "The
    Director, Elta Spring Limited" and accordingly the  funds  fell  to  be
    considered as "invested".  In this  situation   the  applicant  had  to
    submit the specified documents listed under paragraph 46-SD of Appendix
    A.  None of that evidence had been submitted.  Accordingly the  �51,360
    had been discounted from the Respondent's assessment of the funds  that
    he had claimed to have access to.

 4. The judge noted the evidence of the first Appellant,  Mr  Maku  (who  I
    shall refer to as the Appellant), and his  wife  who  had  submitted  a
    corroborative statement.

 5. The Home Office Presenting Officer had argued that  because  the  funds
    had been credited to the business account on 9th April 2014  they  were
    in fact "invested" by the time of the application on  11th  April  2014
    and therefore needed to satisfy the separate  criterion  and  specified
    documents required for funds under the investment route.   The  company
    had a legal entity separate from  the  Appellant  and  the  funds  were
    therefore not his to dispose of as he pleased.

 6.  The  judge  noted  that  in  some  circumstances  there  would  be   a
    considerable difference between the availability of funds placed, where
    the money was placed and the availability  of  money  "utilised"  in  a
    separate entity; for example where the money had been wholly or  partly
    invested in  a  completely  separate  enterprise.   In  this  case  the
    Appellant was the sole director of the company and the  money  had  not
    been in any way "utilised".  It was, in  reality,  totally  accessible,
    certainly for the purposes of the entrepreneurial aim, even if  it  was
    also "invested".  It is  in  the  current  account  of  the  investment
    vehicle and is therefore loan capital repayable on  demand.   In  those
    circumstances the judge found that  the  Appellant  could  satisfy  the
    requirements by submitting the specified documents under paragraph  41-
    SD.

 7. The grounds  of  application  submit  that  the  judge  failed  in  his
    understanding of Rule 41-SD.  It was also said that Rule 46-SD  applied
    the terms of which were set out.  The  grounds  say  it  is  plain  the
    Appellant had invested for the purpose of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    that the judge acted unlawfully in finding otherwise.

 8. The grounds were found to be arguable  and thus the matter came  before
    me on the above date.

 9. Before me Miss Isherwood for the Home Office relied on the grounds  but
    also submitted that it was fundamental that all the documents had to be
    lodged at the time of application, and while not a point taken  in  the
    grounds it was taken under the refusal letter dated 13th May 2014 where
    it was said  that  the  applicant  had  supplied  "none  of  the  above
    evidence".  Being a points-based application the  Tribunal  could  only
    consider evidence submitted at the time of making of  the  application.
    The fact that there were missing documents was confirmed by  the  front
    sheet on the Home Office bundle which noted  what  documents  had  been
    annexed.  On this basis the judge had been wrong to allow  the  appeal.
    Miss Isherwood submitted that, allied to what was said in  the  grounds
    of application the  judge  had  fallen  into  material  error  and  the
    decision should be set aside and the appeal dismissed.

10. For the Appellant Mr Abe submitted that  all  necessary  documents  had
    been  provided in the original application.  Mr Abe indicated  that  it
    was not feasible to produce audited accounts because the  business  had
    been trading for less than  four  months  before  the  application.   A
    letter from the accountant was provided.  In short there was  no  error
    of law in the judge's decision  which should stand.

11. I reserved my decision.

Conclusions

12. The Secretary of State noted that paragraph 45 of  Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules states that where an applicant is  relying  on  funds
    which have already been invested, the specified documents listed  under
    paragraph 46-SD must be submitted.  A significant part of the  argument
    put forward by Miss Isherwood was that the documents under  Rule  46-SD
    had not been lodged.  Judge Oliver focused on the issue of  whether  or
    not the money could  be said to be  "invested"  or  merely  "utilised".
    Looking at what is stated in paragraph 10 of his determination  he  was
    saying that given the Appellant was a sole director of the company,  it
    was totally accessible and the Appellant could satisfy the requirements
    by submitting the specified documents under paragraph  41-SD.   He  was
    therefore not requiring the Appellant to produce documents under 46-SD.
     He was  finding  that  the  Appellant  satisfied  Rule  41-SD  because
    Appellant was showing he had the  money in cash, that he had permission
    to use  the  money  and  it  was  held  in  a  UK  regulated  financial
    institution that was available to the Appellant.

13. It is a clear inference from the judge's findings that he was accepting
    the evidence of the Appellant (and his wife) that  he  had  lodged  the
    necessary documents  under  paragraph  Rule  41  -  SD  and  that  this
    fundamental requirement had been complied with.  There  was  sufficient
    evidence to allow him to do so and it is notable that  the  grounds  of
    application do not suggest otherwise.

14. What the grounds do say is that the failure of the Appellant to produce
    the documents under Rule 46 means that  the  appeal  should  have  been
    dismissed -  plainly  the  judge's  interpretation  of  the  rules  was
    otherwise. It seems to me that it is worthwhile noting the  heading  to
    Rule 46 which reads "Investment and business activity: notes".

15. It is clearly anticipated by the Secretary of State  in  Rule  46  that
    this section is intended to cover the situation where  there  has  been
    investment and business activity and  the  narrative  goes  on  to  say
    evidence must be provided of any investment and business activity  that
    did take place. Such a requirement is entirely logical - the  Secretary
    of State demands to know that the way the investment  and  business  is
    being conducted reaches the appropriate standard. Either the  documents
    produced will reflect that in which case the application is  likely  to
    be granted or if they do not then it likely to be  refused.  Each  case
    will be fact sensitive and will depend on what documents  are  actually
    produced which in turn  will  depend  on  what  actual  investment  and
    business has taken place. If there has  been  no  such  investment  and
    business it follows  that  that  there  will  be  no  documents  to  be
    produced as clearly no such documents will exist.

16. What the judge was finding in this case  that  there  was  no  evidence
    before him that that there had been such investment and business;  from
    what was said to me in submissions it is not suggested by the Secretary
    of State there was any such trading  which  would  have  compelled  the
    lodgement of documents under the section. The judge was taking the view
    that by lodging the appropriate documents  with  the  application   the
    Appellant had satisfied the evidential  requirements of paragraph 41-SD
    and no more was required of him.

17. On the basis of the evidence  submitted  to  him  these  findings  were
    entirely open to the judge and it follows that there is no error in law
    in the judge coming to such a conclusion. The decision must stand.

Decision

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

19. I do not set aside the decision.
