                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                               JENNIFER ANINO

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ian Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:  absent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as  they  were  in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  M  J  Gillespie,  promulgated  on  20
March 2015, which allowed the appellant's appeal on article 8  ECHR  grounds
only.

Background

3. The appellant was born on 23 August 1979. She is a national of Nigeria.


4     On 16 July 2014, the respondent refused  the  appellant's  application
for a derivative residence card as confirmation of  a  derivative  right  of
residence in the UK as the primary carer of a dependent who is  resident  in
the UK.


The Judge's Decision


5     The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First  Tier  Tribunal.  First  Tier
Tribunal Judge M J Gillespie ("the judge") dismissed the appellant's  appeal
under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006  but  allowed  the  appellant's
appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.


6     Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 12 May 2015, First Tier  Tribunal
Judge J Grant Hutchison gave permission to appeal, stating inter alia:


   "It is arguable that the judge misdirected himself in law by allowing the
   application which was made under the provisions of  the  EEA  Regulations
   2006 on the basis of Article 8 when no "one stop" Section 120  notice  of
   the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  and  no   removal
   directions have been served."


7     This appeal originally called before the Upper Tier on 28  July  2015.
That hearing was adjourned to a for mention hearing because the decision  in
the case of Amirteymour & others (EEA appeals;  Human  Rights)  [2015]  UKUT
00466 was awaited which, it was thought,  might  be  determinative  of  this
appeal. When this case called before me for mention on  17  September  2015,
the appellant was neither present nor represented. The case file contains  a
letter dated 16 September 2015 from the appellant's  solicitors  (Kingscourt
Solicitors) stating "Kindly  note  that  our  client  will  not  attend  the
mentioning hearing scheduled for Thursday 17 September 2015...at  10am".  By
letter dated 16 September 2015,  the  appellant's  solicitors  wrote  saying
that they would not attend the hearing on 17 September and went  on  to  say
"In our appeal hearing to  the  Upper  Tribunal  we  wish  to  rely  on  the
skeleton argument and witness statement used in the  hearing  of  the  First
Tier Tribunal. We will also mention the decision of  the  President  of  the
Upper Tribunal, the Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey dated 23 July 2015".

8. Neither the appellant nor her representative was present. I am  satisfied
that due  notice  of  the  appeal  was  served  on  the  appellant  and  her
solicitors. I am satisfied that both the appellant and her  solicitors  made
a conscious decision not to attend the hearing. I consider Paragraph  38  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. It is in  the  interests
of justice to proceed with consideration of this appeal in  the  appellant's
absence.


9     I heard submissions from Mr  Jarvis,  senior  Home  Office  presenting
officer, who quite simply relied on the case of Amirteymour and  invited  me
to allow the judge's decision to dismiss the application  in  terms  of  the
Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 to stand, but  to  find  that  the  judge
could not go further than consideration of the 2006 Regulations, and  so  to
set aside the decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 ECHR.



Analysis

10. In Amirteymour and others (EEA appeals; human rights) [2015] UKUT 00466
 it was held that where no notice under section 120 of  the  2002  Act  has
been served and where no EEA decision to remove has been made, an appellant
cannot bring a Human Rights challenge to removal in an appeal under the EEA
Regulations. Neither the factual matrix nor the reasoning in  JM  (Liberia)
[2006] EWCA Civ 1402 has any application to appeals of this nature.

11    The respondent's decision of 16  July  2014  refused  the  appellant's
application by reference to the  2006  Regulations  alone.  No  section  120
notice was served on the appellant and there are no removal directions.


12     The  judge's  decision  that  the   appellant   cannot   fulfil   the
requirements   of   the   Immigration   (EEA)   Regulations   2006   remains
unchallenged. The appellant has not appealed the decision promulgated on  20
March 2015. The only challenge in this  case  is  to  the  consideration  of
Article 8 ECHR. Having considered the decision  as  a  whole,  I  find  that
there are no material  errors  of  law  contained  in  [2]  to  [8]  of  the
determination and that the judge's decision to dismiss the appeal under  the
Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 does not disclose  a  material  error  in
law and must stand.


13    However, I find that the  judge's  consideration  of  Article  8  ECHR
constitutes a clear material error in law. In the last sentence  of  [1]  of
the decision promulgated on 20 March 2015, the judge incorrectly  refers  to
the appellant's "...rights of private and family life". From  [9]  to  [12],
the judge embarks on an  exercise  considering  the  appellant's  rights  in
terms of Article 8 ECHR. It is  beyond  dispute  that  there  is  neither  a
Section 120 notice  nor  removal  directions  in  this  case.  The  case  of
Amirteymour  makes  is  quite  clear  that  Article  8  ECHR   was   not   a
consideration in this case and was not a matter which could  competently  be
considered by the judge.


Conclusion


14    I therefore find that the determination contains a material  error  of
law and must be set aside.


Decision


15    The decision promulgated on 20 March 2015 is  tainted  by  a  material
error of law in regard to the consideration of Article 8 ECHR  and  must  be
set aside.


16    I consider the case of new and substitute the following decision.


17    The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations  2006.


Signed:
                                           Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Doyle
