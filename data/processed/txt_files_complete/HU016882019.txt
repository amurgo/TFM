For the Respondent:    Mrs Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1     This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  of  the
    First tier Tribunal  Fox  dated  26  June  2019,  in  which  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appellant's  human  rights  appeal.  The  appellant,  a
    national of India, had made an  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on the grounds of long residence. The appellant  had  originally
    arrived in the United Kingdom on 6 October 2007 with entry clearance as
    a student, valid until 31 January 2009. He had obtained further periods
    of leave to remain: as a student, until 8 August 2009; as a Tier 1 Post
    Study Migrant until 13 July 2011; and then as a Tier 1 Migrant until 23
    May 2013, and then 7 June 2016. On 6 June 2016  the  appellant  applied
    for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant. On 31 October  2017
    he varied that application to an application for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on the basis of 10  years  residence.  The  appellant  has  been
    employed in the UK as a business analyst, on a self employed basis/as a
    director of his own company, and also as an employee of Barclays Bank.

2     As part of the process of considering the appellant's application  for
    leave  to  remain,  the  respondent  issued  the   appellant   with   a
    questionnaire regarding his employment  during  his  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom, and asking, at question 14, if he had  ever  needed  to
    correct or resubmit tax returns for the financial years  for  which  he
    had gained leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  appellant
    completed and signed the questionnaire on 7 April 2017.  He  stated  at
    question two that he had been self-employed during the year  2010/2011,
    and the director of a limited company during the years  2012/2013,  and
    2013/2014.

3      The  appellant  explained  at  question  14(a)  that   his   previous
    accountant had made a mistake in the completion of his tax returns.  He
    explained as follows:

         "My  previous  accountant,  Cahinia,  stated  they  prepared   self
         assessment to include for 12 month period (11/11/2010 - 30/10/2011)
         to submit in January 2013. Therefore, they did not include the self-
         employment  figures  in  January  2012  tax  return.  However,  the
         accounting firm confirms they inadvertently forgot to submit it  in
         January 2013. I was not available due to my severe  illness  caused
         due to epilepsy seizures. I had multiple  incidences  of  epileptic
         fits and was sentenced to A&E  emergency  department.  This  caused
         loss of consciousness  and  loss  of  memory  to  me.  The  medical
         condition affected my  level  of  awareness  and  caused  long-term
         depression to me. This made difficult  for  me  to  keep  track  of
         business and filing precisely." (sic)

4     In his decision of 10 January 2019,  refusing  leave  to  remain,  and
    refusing the appellant's human rights  claim,  the  respondent  averred
    that  the  appellant  had  been  dishonest  in  his  tax  affairs.  The
    respondent noted that for the tax year 2010/11 information provided  to
    HMRC showed that the appellant had an earned (PAYE) income  of  �14,420
    gross, and for the same period, earned self employed  income  of  minus
    �1470. The respondent asserted that these details had been  filed  with
    HMRC on 3 January 2012. However, the respondent noted that HMRC records
    for that tax year showed that an updated income of �32,606 was filed on
    4 March 2016, not long before the application for ILR made  on  6  June
    2016.   The  respondent  noted  that  the  appellant  had  provided  an
    explanation for the rectification of his tax return for 2010/2011,  but
    asserted that the appellant had only sought to rectify his tax  returns
    in 2016, in the knowledge that he would be called to  account  for  his
    previous tax returns when applying for indefinite leave to  remain.  It
    was asserted that the appellant's explanation for why  he  provided  an
    amended return had not been accepted. The respondent asserted that  the
    appellant had either falsely declared his earnings to the UKVI in order
    to gain leave to remain and then filed tax returns to HMRC at  a  later
    date prior to making an application  where  previous  earnings  may  be
    investigated, or, that he had in fact had legitimate earnings from self
    employment which he had declared to UKVI  but  deliberately  failed  to
    declare them to HMRC and a later date  remedied  this  to  avoid  being
    penalized.

5     The  respondent  averred  that  in  either  scenario  the  appellant's
    character and conduct was considered questionable and  found  that  the
    appellant's character and conduct was such that it would be undesirable
    to allow the him to remain in the United Kingdom,  and  the  respondent
    invoked the general grounds for refusal  at  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    immigration rules.

6     The respondent also considered the requirements of paragraph 276B  for
    indefinite leave to remain, and  asserted  by  reference  to  paragraph
    276B(ii)(c)  that  the  appellant's  personal  history,  including  his
    character, conduct, associations and employment record were  such  that
    leave to remain ought not be granted. Further, as paragraph  322(5)  of
    the  rules  had  been  invoked  (general  grounds  for  refusal),   the
    requirement in paragraph 276B(iii) was not met.

7     The appellant appealed against the decision, his appeal coming  before
    the judge at the Birmingham hearing centre on 11 June 2019.

8     The appellant relied upon a witness statement dated  5  June  2019  in
    which he provided as follows  regarding  his  amended  tax  return  for
    2010/2011:

         "10.     You will note from  the  questionnaire  that  my  previous
         accountants,  Cahinia,  advised  me  that  rather  than   including
         earnings for a five month period [01.11.10- 30.03.11] in  my  self-
         assessment tax return I should include earnings for a  twelve-month
         period (11.11.10 - 30.10.11).

         11.      Cahinia confirmed to me they would prepare and submit  the
         relevant self-assessment tax return for me in January 2013 (sic). I
         followed their advice in good faith. I had no reason to doubt  that
         they would act in accordance with my instructions.

         12.      However, when my current accountants, SAI Accountants Ltd,
         went through my earnings  for  the  relevant  five-year  period  in
         January 2011 it was discovered  that  my  previous  accountant  had
         failed to act in accordance with my instructions.  It  is  apparent
         that Cahinia  entered  the  details  for  my  earnings  from  self-
         employment incorrectly in the self-assessment tax return of January
         2012.

         ...

         14.      Since submitting my appeal,  the  accountant  to  question
         (EN), of  Cahinia  Accountancy  &  Business  Advisory  Service  has
         emailed me to confirm that a member of staff 'made an error' on the
         tax return for  the  year  ending  31.03.11  and  the  I  was  'not
         available to review' the self-assessment  tax  return  'before  the
         return was filed due to ill ill health (sic)'. This email  supports
         my version of events.

         15.      I asked him to explain exactly how the error occurred  but
         he was not able to confirm this as the mistake had been made  by  a
         member of staff who had since left the firm. He speculated that  it
         was data entry error. He was unwilling to go into any  more  detail
         than in his email of 29.05.19.

         16.      I have been asking (EN) for confirmation of the events  in
         writing for months but he kept  putting  it  off.  He  was  clearly
         anxious to admit fault as it could open him up  to  a  professional
         negligence claim. I asked him if he was willing to give evidence in
         person at my hearing that he declined. He even refused to  put  his
         explanation on the firm's letterhead paper."

9     Also relevant within the appellant's statement is his  description  of
    his health. He provides as follows:

         "21.     I have suffered from a number seizures which have  led  to
         me being hospitalised and on one occasion to have  serious  surgery
         on my arm. I am still taking  regular  medication  and  despite  my
         health difficulties I have established a successful life for myself
         in the UK. I submitted my medical records under cover of  my  legal
         representatives' letter dated 07.04.17 to corroborate this."

10    In his decision, the judge directed himself at [7] that the burden  of
    proof lay with the  respondent  as  he  was  alleging  dishonesty,  and
    referred to the authorities of  Khan,  R  (on  the  application  of)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,
    paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) ('Khan'), and Balajigari v SSHD
    [2019] EWCA Civ 673 ('Balajigari').

11    The judge referred to the evidence before him from [25]  onwards,  and
    set out his findings from [43], stating:

         "The  respondent  has  satisfied  the  burden  upon  him.  I  apply
         Balajigari and Khan as part of my decision."

12    The judge held  at  [45],  (and  also  at  [72]  and  [86])  that  the
    appellant had 'failed to provide an innocent explanation'; and at  [50]
    that 'the respondent was entitled to arrive at his  decision  that  the
    appellant  had  acted  dishonestly  in  relation   to   the   offending
    application when the available evidence is considered  in  the  round.'
    The judge set out certain  reasons  for  those  findings  at  [51]-[69]
    before concluding  at  [70]  that  'For  all  the  reasons  stated  the
    respondent was entitled to apply Rule 322(5) of the Immigration Rules'.
    The judge referred at [73]-[74] to the consequences that were likely to
    flow for the appellant following the judge's findings but held at  [76]
    that the appellant was excluded from relying on the  Immigration  Rules
    on the basis of Rule 322(5). Further, no significant obstacles  existed
    in relation to his integration in India [77]. The judge  considered  at
    [87]-[93]  whether  the  decision  to  refuse  leave  to  remain  would
    represent a disproportionate interference with the appellant's  private
    life rights under Article 8 ECHR, and concluded that it  did  not.  The
    appeal was dismissed.

13    The appellant sought permission to  appeal  against  the  decision  in
    grounds of appeal dated 5 July 2019, arguing that the  judge  erred  in
    law, in summary, as follows (and adopting the  paragraph  numbering  in
    the appellant's grounds of appeal):

    4(a)   making a material misdirection in law  by  failing  to  consider
         that an evidential burden only fell upon the appellant, not a legal
         burden, such burden being to raise an innocent explanation for  the
         discrepancy in his tax returns which satisfied the minimum level of
         plausibility (Muhandiramge  (section  S-LTR.1.7)  [2015]  UKUT  675
         (IAC) and Shen (paper appeals; proving dishonesty) [2014] UKUT  236
         (IAC);

    4(b)   making  an  irrational  finding/material  mistake  of  fact,  in
         purporting to find at [56]  that  the  appellant  had  set  up  his
         business activity which conflicted directly  with  his  employment,
         such finding having no evidential or rational foundation, and was a
         matter which was not put to the appellant and the  judge  proceeded
         unfairly by making such a finding;

    4(c)   failing to consider  properly  the  content  of  an  email  from
         Cahinia  accountants  in  the  appellant's  bundle  at   page   464
         explaining how the accounting error took place;

    4(d)    failing  to  consider  material  matters/making  an  irrational
         finding - speculating at [62] that the appellant was alleging  that
         his previous accountant  had  forged  his  signature  or  the  HMRC
         accepted  the  tax  return  without  a  signed  declaration;   such
         hypotheses being irrational, as the appellant had instructed  those
         accountants as authorized agent to handle his tax affairs and could
         submit a tax return on his behalf;

    4(e)   proceeding under  a  material  mistake  of  fact;  appearing  to
         believe that the appellant had ceased trading after  the  offending
         application had been submitted to HMRC, whereas that  was  not  the
         case;

    4(f)   misdirecting himself in law, as to  the  arguments  advanced  on
         behalf of the appellant, by suggesting at [67] that  the  appellant
         had not asserted that HMRC's decision not to penalise  him  was  of
         any probative value in the appeal; that proposition was denied; the
         appellant had, through his Counsel, sought to rely  upon  the  fact
         that HMRC had not penalised the  appellant  in  2016  following  an
         amended tax return, as  a  relevant  consideration  as  to  whether
         dishonesty had been employed by the appellant in 2012 (indeed  this
         is clear from the appellant's addendum skeleton argument, para 15);

    4(g)   failing to consider material matters:  at  [65]-[66]  the  judge
         referred to the appellant's  health  but  had  failed  properly  to
         engage with  evidence  relating  to  the  appellant's  health  when
         previously considering  whether  or  not  the  appellant  had  been
         dishonest;

    4(h)   misdirecting himself in law, when suggesting at  [76]  that  the
         alleged deception in 2012 resulted in the appellant's  last  lawful
         leave expiring on 13 July 2011, as  all  further  grants  of  leave
         followed on from that application.

14    Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First  tier  Tribunal
    Simpson on 5 August 2019.

    Submissions

15    I heard submissions from Mr. Pipe on  behalf  of  the  appellant,  who
    expanded upon the grounds, and Ms Aboni,  who  defended  the  decision,
    arguing that the decision was open to the judge on the evidence  before
    him and that the  judge  gave  reasons  for  the  decision  which  were
    adequate in law.

    Discussion

    Ground 4(a): burden of proof

16    In its judgment in Balajigari, the Court of  Appeal  agreed  with  the
    proposition that the application of paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration
    Rules involves a two  stage  analysis;  the  first  being  that  it  is
    'undesirable' to grant leave to  remain,  in  the  light  of  specified
    matters, and a second stage, to decide,  as  a  matter  of  discretion,
    whether leave to remain should be refused on the basis if it.

17    The first stage itself requires a three stage analysis. There must  be
    (i) reliable evidence, of (ii) sufficiently reprehensible conduct,  and
    (iii) an assessment taking proper account of all relevant circumstances
    known about the applicant at the date of decision, of  whether  his  or
    her presence in the UK is undesirable (Balajigari,  paras  33-34).  The
    Court also agreed at  [35],  that  in  an  earnings  discrepancy  case,
    sufficiently reprehensible conduct would only  be  established  if  the
    discrepancy was as a result of dishonesty on the part of the applicant.



18    It is also  appropriate  to  set  out  paragraph  42  of  the  Court's
    judgement:

         "Although Martin  Spencer  J  clearly  makes  the  point  that  the
         Secretary of State must carefully consider any case  advanced  that
         the  discrepancy  is  the  result  of  carelessness   rather   than
         dishonesty, there is in our view a danger that his "starting-point"
         mis-states  the  position.  A  discrepancy  between  the   earnings
         declared to HMRC and to the Home Office may justifiably  give  rise
         to a suspicion that it is the result of dishonesty but it does  not
         by itself justify a conclusion to that effect. What it does  is  to
         call for an explanation. If  an  explanation  once  sought  is  not
         forthcoming, or is unconvincing, it may at that point be legitimate
         for the Secretary of State to infer dishonesty; but  even  in  that
         case the position is not that  there  is  a  legal  burden  on  the
         applicant to disprove  dishonesty.  The  Secretary  of  State  must
         simply decide, considering the discrepancy  in  the  light  of  the
         explanation (or lack of it),  whether  he  is  satisfied  that  the
         applicant has been dishonest." (Emphasis added)

19    Although the authority of Muhandiramge does not appear  to  have  been
    considered by the Court in its judgment, I am of the view that there is
    nothing in  the  Court's  judgment,  in  particular  having  regard  to
    paragraph [42] of the judgment,  set  out  above,  which  disturbs  the
    guidance given in Muhandiramge at paragraph 10:

         "One of the more recent reported decisions belonging to this stable
         is that of Shen (Paper Appeals: Proving Dishonesty) [2014] UKUT 236
         (IAC). This decision is  illustrative  of  the  moderately  complex
         exercise required of tribunals from time to time.  Here  the  Upper
         Tribunal held, in  harmony  with  established  principle,  that  in
         certain contexts the evidential pendulum swings three times and  in
         three different directions:

         (a)      First, where  the  Secretary  of  State  alleges  that  an
         applicant has practised dishonesty or deception in  an  application
         for leave to remain, there is an evidential burden on the Secretary
         of State. This requires that  sufficient  evidence  be  adduced  to
         raise an issue as to the existence or non-existence of  a  fact  in
         issue: for example, by producing the completed application which is
         prima facie deceitful in some material fashion.

         (b)      The spotlight thereby switches to  the  applicant.  If  he
         discharges the burden - again, an evidential one -  of  raising  an
         innocent explanation, namely an account which satisfies the minimum
         level of plausibility, a further transfer of the  burden  of  proof
         occurs.

         (c)      Where (b) is satisfied, the burden rests on the  Secretary
         of State to establish, on the balance of  probabilities,  that  the
         Appellant's prima facie innocent explanation is  to  be  rejected."
         (Emphasis added)

20    Mr Pipe's submission is that it  was  not  evident  from  the  judge's
    decision that he was considering whether the appellant's explanation as
    to the earnings  discrepancy  for  the  relevant  year  represented  an
    account which satisfied 'the minimum level of plausibility'  so  as  to
    transfer the burden to the respondent to  establish  to  a  balance  of
    probabilities that the prima  facie  innocent  explanation  was  to  be
    rejected.

21    Although it is correct to note that the judge  does  not  specifically
    direct himself in law as to the terms of  Muhandiramge,  and  does  not
    explicitly state that  the  burden  on  the  appellant  to  provide  an
    innocent explanation was an evidential one, not a legal one,  I  am  of
    the view that it has not been established that  the  judge  misdirected
    himself in law as to the shifting burdens of proof that may apply in  a
    case such as the  present.  The  judge  referred  to  the  most  recent
    authorities relating to earnings discrepancy cases, and  I  cannot  see
    that he has failed to apply  them.   It  was  clear  from  the  judge's
    decision at [7], [49], [50], and [70] that he was aware that the  legal
    burden to establish dishonesty lay on the respondent. No error  of  law
    arises.

22    Even if I am wrong about that, it is sufficiently clear,  reading  the
    judge's decision as a whole,  that  the  judge  was  finding  that  the
    appellant's explanation did not meet  the  requirement  to  provide  an
    innocent explanation which met even a minimum  level  of  plausibility.
    Thus, any failure to make direct reference to  Muhandiramge  or  as  to
    whether the burden on the appellant was an evidential one, or  a  legal
    one, did not represent an error of law that was material to the outcome
    of the appeal.

23    I find no material error of law in relation to the  appellant's  first
    ground.

    Ground 4(b): irrational finding that appellant worked in conflict  with
    his paid employment

24    I agree with the appellant that  there  does  not  appear  to  be  any
    proper  evidential  basis  for  finding  that  the   appellant's   self
    employment as  a  business  analyst  necessarily  represented  business
    activity which conflicted directly with the business activities of  his
    employer. There was no evidence that the appellant  was,  for  example,
    poaching clients from Barclays Bank. However, even if the judge thought
    that there was some conflict between the  business  activities  of  the
    appellant and his employer, I cannot see that such  a  finding  was  in
    fact relied upon by the judge  in  any  material  way  in  support  the
    judge's overall finding that the appellant had been  dishonest  in  his
    dealings with the respondent and/or the HMRC. It was  not  in  dispute,
    for example, that the appellant had in fact been  employed  on  both  a
    self employed basis, and on an employed basis, at  the  relevant  time.
    The judge's comment was in reality not relevant to  the  issues  before
    him, but I cannot in any event see that the comment actually played any
    part in the judge's overall decision making.

    Ground 4(c): failing to consider properly the accountant's  explanation
    for the accounting error

25    The judge referred to the evidence relating  to  the  actions  of  the
    appellant, his accountant, and the accountant's explanation at  various
    points of the decision, in particular at [28], [32],  [40],  and  [60].
    It is  unsustainable  to  assert  that  the  judge  did  not  take  the
    explanation from Cahinia into account. Insofar as the  appellant  avers
    that the judge was incorrect in  law  to  describe  the  evidence  from
    Cahinia as a 'bare admission of error', I find no error of law  in  the
    judge describing Cahinia's explanation in those terms: the  email  from
    Cahinia within the appellant's bundle at  [464],  referred  to  by  the
    judge at [60], provides that:

         "This is to confirm that during the preparation of Self  Assessment
         Tax Return for Kailash Bora for the year ended 31 March 2011 one of
         my staff at that time made an error on the Tax Return.

         Mr Bora was not available to review the Self Assessment before  the
         return was filed due to ill health."

26    The email then points out that the appellant had  informed  them  that
    the appellant had later had his tax return corrected by the appellant's
    new  accountants.  The  explanation  quoted  above  could  properly  be
    described as a bare admission of error. There is no explanation of what
    the nature of the error was, what was done, what should have been done,
    what instructions had been provided by the appellant  at  the  relevant
    time, or any kind of explanation as to how any error arose. There is no
    error in the judge's assessment of  the  explanation  provided  by  the
    appellant's accountants. Insofar as  Mr  Pipe  argues  that  the  judge
    failed to have regard to evidence in an email  from  the  appellant  at
    [462] as to the difficulty that he had in obtaining a response from his
    former accountants, it is to  be  noted  that  the  judge  specifically
    recorded at [40] that  the  appellant  relied  on  the  email  exchange
    between the appellant and Cahinia,  at  [462-464]  of  the  appellant's
    bundle.

27    The judge was not obliged to set out within his decision  the  content
    of every document taken into account by him. He  clearly  records  that
    his attention  was  drawn  to  the  appellant's  email  at  [462].  The
    appellant was there attempting to secure written confirmation from  the
    accountant of the alleged content of a conversation between Cahinia and
    the appellant's solicitor in which Cahinia is  said  to  have  accepted
    that the person completing the tax return in January 2012 had 'lack  of
    experience'. Even without referring directly to the appellant's attempt
    to obtain  a  further  explanation  from  Cahinia,  there  was  nothing
    erroneous in law in the judge ultimately finding at [60] that "There is
    no  reasonable  explanation  for  this  significant  oversight  of  why
    Cahinia's  practices  fell  so  short  of  an  acceptable  professional
    standard ..."

    Ground  4(d);  speculating  at  [62]  that  Cahinia  had   forged   the
    appellant's  signature/erring  in  finding  'not  credible'  that  HMRC
    accepted the tax return without a signed declaration

28    I agree that  there  was  no  evidential  basis  which  supported  any
    finding that Cahinia forged the appellant's signature, and I cannot see
    any evidence to suggest  that  the  appellant  accused  them  of  that.
    Furthermore, insofar as  the  judge  appears  to  find  in  the  second
    sentence of [62] that it was 'not credible' that HMRC  accepted  a  tax
    return without a signed declaration by the appellant, I  take  judicial
    notice of the fact that on-line tax returns do not require  a  physical
    signature; the submission of the form on line represents  an  assertion
    that the contents are true; and the appellant's  accountants  had  been
    instructed to file a tax return. Thus, the judge appears to have  erred
    in law, in making a finding which was not supported  by  evidence,  and
    which, in relation to this issue, was at least potentially  capable  of
    affecting  the  judge's   overall   assessment   of   the   appellant's
    credibility.

29    I return below to the question as to whether such error  was  actually
    material to the outcome of the appeal.

    Ground 4(e): proceeding under a material mistake of fact; appearing  to
    believe that the appellant  had  ceased  trading  after  the  offending
    application had been submitted to HMRC

30    The judge appeared to find at [55] that the appellant  ceased  trading
    at the time he submitted 'the offending application' and held  at  [64]
    that 'it is reasonable to conclude that the  appellant  has  failed  to
    provide reliable evidence of the reason  he  ceased  trading  once  the
    offending application had been submitted and the reasons why he amended
    his tax records in the period immediately prior to his application  for
    indefinite leave to remain'.

31    Mr Pipe argues that the judge proceeded under a mistake of  fact.  The
    appellant's grounds of  appeal  assert  that  the  appellant  was  self
    employed as a sole trader for the year 2010-2011, and set up a  limited
    company from which he earned dividends, for the  tax  years  2012-2014.
    Reference  is  made  to  paragraph  [19]  of  the  appellant's  witness
    statement,  in  which  it  was  said  the  appellant  referred  to  tax
    calculation  summaries  for  the  years  2012-2016,  showing  that   he
    consistently earned �35,000 for each year.

32    In fact, paragraph [19] of the appellant's  witness  statement  refers
    to tax calculation summaries 'for the years ending 05.04.12,  05.04.13,
    05.04.14, 05.04.15  and  05.04.16  [see  pages  330-333  of  my  appeal
    bundle]". However, the appellant's tax calculation summary for the year
    ending 05.04.12 does not appear in the page range  [330]-[333]  of  the
    appellant's bundle, but rather, at page  [329].  This  shows  that  the
    appellant's declared income from all employments for the  year  2011-12
    was �19,739, with tax payable of �2,452. There is no reference in  that
    document to income from dividends and his income was clearly less  than
    �35,000  as  apparently  asserted  by  the  appellant  in  his  witness
    statement.

33    Further, the appellant accepts in his responses to the question  9(d)-
    (e) of the questionnaire dated 7 April 2017  that  had  traded  for  23
    months, from Nov 2010-March 2011, and from October 2012 -  April  2014.
    There was clearly a break in his trading, and he ceased  trading  as  a
    self employed sole trader in March 2011.

34    I find that it has not  been  established  that  the  judge  proceeded
    under any mistake of relevant  fact  when  he  held  that  '...  it  is
    reasonable to  conclude  that  the  appellant  has  failed  to  provide
    reliable evidence of the reason he ceased trading  once  the  offending
    application had been submitted ...'

    Ground 4(f): misdirection/failure  to  take  into  account  a  relevant
    factor; that HMRC had not penalized the appellant in 2016 following  an
    amended tax return

35    Having had regard to Counsel's addendum skeleton argument  before  the
    judge, it is apparent that the appellant did argue that the  fact  that
    HMRC did not impose any penalty against the appellant  in  relation  to
    his amended tax return for 2010/2011, was a relevant  consideration  in
    the assessment of whether the  appellant  ahead  acted  dishonestly  in
    relation to his tax affairs.

36    I accept that the judge therefore misrepresented the appellant's  case
    as  to  relevant  considerations  he  sought  to  rely  upon,   and   I
    additionally find that the fact that HMRC did not  impose  any  penalty
    was indeed capable of being a relevant consideration in the  assessment
    of the appellant's honesty. Whilst at paragraph 66  of  Balajigari  the
    Court of Appeal appear to reject the proposition that the absence of  a
    penalty imposed by HMRC is determinative that an  error  was  innocent,
    the Court appears to proceed in the last 2 lines of [74]  that  such  a
    consideration would remain relevant to the assessment of an applicant's
    explanation for an inaccurate tax return.

37    The judge thus errs in law and failed to take into account a  material
    consideration.

38    I return below to the question of whether such error was  material  to
    the outcome of the appeal.

    Ground  4(g):  failure  to  consider  the   appellant's   health   when
    considering whether or not the appellant had been dishonest

39     This  submission  is  not  made  out.  The  judge  referred  to   the
    appellant's health, in particular the lack of any  real  evidence  that
    the appellant suffered from any material ill health at  the  time  that
    the tax return for 2010-11 was filed in January 2012, in  his  decision
    at [56], [57], [58],  and  [65].  There  was  nothing  in  any  of  the
    documents that Mr Pipe referred me to in submissions which demonstrated
    that the judge had left any relevant evidence regarding the appellant's
    health out of account.

    Ground 4(h): misdirecting himself in law, when at [76]  the  judge  had
    suggested that the alleged deception  in  2012  resulted  in  his  last
    lawful leave expiring on 13 July 2011, as all further grants  of  leave
    followed from that application.

40    I agree that the judge erred in law in appearing to find  that,  as  a
    consequence  of  the  judge's  finding  that  the  appellant  had  been
    dishonest in his application for leave to remain  in  March  2011,  his
    lawful leave to remain should be considered to have expired on 13  July
    2011 (leave granted to him on 13 July 2009).

41    This is an erroneous suggestion. The  respondent  has  not  sought  to
    curtail any period of leave to remain, and the judge himself  noted  at
    the outset of the decision at [24] that the  parties  agreed  that  the
    outcome of the  appeal  depended  on  the  judge's  assessment  of  the
    applicability of para 322(5) of the Immigration Rules; it is  impliedly
    accepted  within  that  acknowledgment  that  the  appellant  otherwise
    satisfied the requirements for indefinite leave  to  remain,  including
    his possession of lawful leave to remain for the relevant period.

42    However, I find that the judge's comment at [76],  that  the  apparent
    result of his decision that the appellant had  been  dishonest  in  his
    application for leave to remain in 2011, was that  he  had  no  further
    lawful leave thereafter, was not  relevant  to  the  finding  that  the
    appellant had employed dishonesty, which the judge had clearly  already
    made, for the reasons previously set out in his  decision  before  para
    [76]. The judge's erroneous comment was irrelevant to the issues in the
    appeal  and  had  no  effect  upon  the  judge's   decision   regarding
    dishonesty.

    Materiality

43    I have found above that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in  a  number  of
    respects. However, I have found that  the  only  errors  that  had  any
    arguable potential to be material to the outcome of the appeal were the
    following:

    (i)    making a finding which  was  not  supported  by  evidence  (that
         Cahinia had potentially forged the  appellant's  signature,  and/or
         that it was 'not credible' that HMRC accepted a tax return  without
         a signed declaration by the appellant); and

    (ii)   failing to take into account  the  material  consideration  that
         HMRC did not penalise the appellant in 2016 following  his  amended
         tax return.

44    I find that due to the preponderance of other  reasons  given  by  the
    judge for finding that the appellant had acted dishonestly in  relation
    to his tax return of January 2012/his application for leave  to  remain
    in March 2011, that such errors were not material to the outcome of the
    appeal, and the judge would inevitably have dismissed the  appeal,  had
    he not erred as he did.

45    The judge relied upon the following factors in support of his  finding
    that the appellant had acted dishonestly:

    (i)    the judge did not accept that the appellant did not  have  sight
         of his tax return [51];

    (ii)   in relation to his tax return for the year  2010/2011,  and  his
         application for leave to remain made on 31 March 2011, it  was  not
         credible that the appellant would be  capable  of  making  reliable
         representations to the respondent, but incapable of making reliable
         representations to HMRC, on the same material matters [52];

    (iii)  having regard to the appellant's qualifications, and the  nature
         of his work as a professional business analyst, and holding himself
         out as an expert for the purpose of business  analysis  consultancy
         services, it was reasonable  to  expect  the  appellant  to  notice
         Cahinia's error before 2016 [53]-[54];

    (iv)   in relation to the alleged ill health which the appellant relied
         upon to excuse his overlooking a declared loss by  Cahinia  to  the
         HMRC, there was no  reliable  evidence  that  his  health  problems
         affected his ability to  continue  in  his  main  employment  (with
         Barclays Bank); although there was  evidence  of  absence  for  ill
         health from Barclays Bank in October 2014, there  was  no  reliable
         evidence to demonstrate that the appellant's alleged medical  needs
         affected his employment and activities with  Barclays  in  2011  or
         2012 as claimed [57]-[58];

    (v)    family and friends, said to have assisted the  appellant  during
         his period of alleged incapacity, had not noticed  Cahinia's  error
         [59];

    (vi)   Cahinia's explanation was a bare admission  of  error,  with  no
         reasonable explanation for the error [60];

    (vii)  there was no evidence of any complaint made by the appellant  to
         Cahinia's regulator, or any demand by the  appellant  that  Cahinia
         pay for the audit that the appellant's  later  accountants  carried
         out on the appellant's accounts [61];

    (viii) the appellant had failed to provide  reliable  evidence  of  the
         reason why he amended his tax  return,  immediately  prior  to  his
         application for indefinite   leave  to  remain  [64],  taking  into
         account that the appellant had relied upon his historic ill  health
         as the reason for his uncertainty that caused him to doubt that  he
         had made accurate representations to the respondent; the  appellant
         was therefore aware of the potential for misrepresentations to form
         part of his immigration history [65];

    (ix)   the appellant was vague and evasive in his oral evidence [68];

    (x)    the appellant was unable or unwilling to confirm whether he paid
         his tax contributions directly to HMRC [69].

46    I therefore find that any error of law on the part of  the  judge  was
    not material to the outcome of the appeal.




    Decision

    I find that the decision did not involve the  making  of  any  material
    error of law.

    The appellant's appeal is dismissed.
