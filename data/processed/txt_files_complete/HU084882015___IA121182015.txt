Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Biggs, Counsel, instructed by JKR Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Wylie promulgated on 11 May 2016 allowing the appeals of
    Mr & Mrs Majid, as I shall call them.  I shall refer to Mr & Mrs  Majid
    as the appellants as they were before the First-tier Tribunal. They are
    both nationals of Bangladesh and they have a child who is  called  Raem
    Sabahat Waquar, who was born on 16 December 2013.

 2. The immigration history has been set out in the determination.   It  is
    broadly this: that the appellant, Mr Majid, entered the United  Kingdom
    on 1 August 2005 as a student and he was granted successive periods  of
    leave until 30 November 2009. He  then  appealed  during  a  period  of
    extant leave on 18 November 2009 for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student. That application was rejected on 13  March  2010  on
    the basis that the relevant fee had not been paid and he applied  on  6
    May 2010 as a Tier 1 (Post-Study) Visa holder which was granted from 21
    May 2010 until May 2012. Thereafter there  were  subsequent  grants  of
    leave.  The application that he eventually made was on the  basis  that
    he had established ten continuous years of lawful residence.

 3. The issue that is before me concerns the period which  exists  from  13
    March 2010 to 6 May 2010, a period of about two and a half  months,  70
    days, during which he did not apparently have further leave to  remain.



 4. If the  application  he  had  made  on  13  March  2010  been  a  valid
    application (indeed, had the fee in relation to that  application  been
    paid), then he would have been able to establish the all-important  ten
    years'  continuous  lawful  residence  in  order  to  make   good   his
    application for indefinite leave to remain.  On the other hand  if  the
    application had failed for the reason because that the fee had not been
    paid then, in those circumstances,  there  would  be  a  break  in  the
    continuity.

 5. It also has to be said that it would now  be  much  more  difficult,  I
    suspect, for him to establish a right to indefinite leave to remain  as
    a result of Rule changes that have happened.  Accordingly a great  deal
    hinges on whether or not there was a period of  unsanctioned  leave  or
    whether the application that he made on 18 November 2009  was  lawfully
    rejected in the decision made on 13 March 2010.

 6. The evidence in relation to this is found  in  a  bundle  of  documents
    provided by the appellant.  Page 15 and page 15A is the  decision  made
    by the Secretary of State on 13 March 2010 and that  indicated  in  the
    relevant passage, page 15A, that

         "Although credit/debit card details have been provided, the issuing
         bank rejected the payment. There may have been  insufficient  funds
         in  the  account  or  the  details  provided  did  not  match   the
         information held by  the  bank.   For  security  reasons  the  card
         holder's name, address, expiry date and issue  number  supplied  on
         the payment form must correspond with the information held  by  the
         issuing bank. If the details fail to match, the  bank  will  reject
         the payment.  The fresh  application  should  be  returned  to  the
         address given on the application form."

 7. That was, of course, the first indication  provided  to  the  appellant
    that the application that he had made was in some way flawed and so  he
    took action by writing to the bank.  We do not know quite when he wrote
    to the bank but it was clearly within a day  or  so  of  receiving  the
    letter of rejection from the Secretary  of  State  because  the  bank's
    reply is dated 22 March 2010.  That is a letter (which it  is  accepted
    is a genuine letter) from the personal banking manager  of  Mr  Majid's
    account who says this [page 16]:

         "I am writing to confirm that Mr Waquar Majid  has  held  at  least
         �1,623.44 in his account within the month of  November  2010.   The
         Home  Office  letter  states  that  the  bank  has   declined   the
         transaction on 18 November 2009 in  which  you  have  attempted  to
         debit �407 from his account using the card number ending 5924 where
         the customer was in credit by �1,669.89.  I have looked into  notes
         and did not  find  any  information  about  the  transaction  being
         declined within the month of November 2009.  I  have  also  advised
         the customer to make a cheque payment instead."

 8. That letter from the bank prompted the applicant to send a letter which
    we see at [page 40] of the bundle to the Secretary of State saying

         "Thank you for your letter  dated  13  March  2010.   I  have  been
         informed via your letter that the bank rejected to clear my payment
         in relation to my application and I asked my bank about your  issue
         and hereby I would take the opportunity to inform me that  my  bank
         has declined such allegation that any  request  made  to  take  the
         payment by the UKBA in relation to the fees."

 9. He then also explained that he had become the holder of a  BSc  Honours
    in international  tourism  and  hospitality  and  consequently  he  was
    intending to change his application to a  post-study  work  application
    rather than the Tier 4 application that had originally been made.

10. The Secretary of State did not respond to that application and  it  was
    taken up when the appellant made his further application on 6 May  2010
    where he reiterated the fact that he had written a letter on  29  March
    2010 as to what he should do.  He also indicated that the  college  had
    advised him to apply for a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)  application  since
    he had already got his degree.  That would have been done if the normal
    course of things (as I understand it) as a variation  of  the  original
    application.

11. In support of his appeal the appellant provided a witness statement and
    that is found at page 1 of the bundle and it is paragraphs 4 - 11 which
    are the material passages.  In it he sets out the history largely as  I
    have set out and importantly he gave information as to the steps he had
    taken to try and formalise  the  position  as  a  result  of  what  had
    occurred. He said at paragraph 11 [page 3]:

         "At that stage I  decided  to  write  to  the  UKBA  explaining  my
         situation and in particular informing their  fault  in  failing  to
         take money from my card.  I did so as I was so advised  by  one  Mr
         Poddar who to  my  knowledge  was  a  law  graduate  and  had  some
         experience as immigration advisor and who agreed to write a  letter
         for me to be sent to UKBA as I  asked  his  asistance.   Mr  Poddar
         wrote the letter on my instruction and sent it  to  me  through  my
         email.  I posted the same on the following day, on 29  March  2010,
         with enclosures."

12. The enclosures which are referred to in the letter of 29 March 2010 are
    a copy of his results and  letters  from  the  college.   They  do  not
    therefore appear to include the  all-important  letter  from  the  bank
    although it is said, as I have already  recited,  at  the  top  of  the
    letter that he had been informed that the bank had not rejected payment
    as a result of anything the appellant had done.

13. The decision of the Immigration Judge was  made  by  reference  to  the
    Tribunal decision of Basnet  (Validity  of  application  -  respondent)
    [2012] UKUT 00113.  That has some bearing  on  the  issue  of  how  the
    Secretary of State or an appellant is to proceed in a case where  there
    is an issue as to the  payment  of  the  relevant  fee.  However,  that
    decision has been the subject of re-examination in the subsequent  case
    of Mitchell (Basnet  revisited)  [2015]  UKUT  00562  where  the  Upper
    Tribunal stated that the decision in Basnet should be the subject of  a
    slightly more nuanced decision-making  process and that what  was  said
    in Basnet was rather too broad.  It would have been  better  of  course
    had the case of Mitchell (Basnet revisited) been  referred  to  by  the
    judge. I am sure that it was not an intentional omission on the part of
    the advocate, rather than his simply unaware of the later decision. But
    it is perfectly right that the judge should have  considered  what  was
    said in Basnet in light of the Upper Tribunal's comments in Mitchell.

14. However the upshot would not have been  any  different  because  it  is
    clear that the judge had to make findings of fact as to who was or  who
    was responsible for the non-payment of the fee. At that  stage  in  the
    course  of  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  the
    respondent did not appear and was not represented.  So it was  for  the
    judge to make what he could of the  appellant's  evidence  and  he  set
    about making findings of fact.  The relevant findings of fact are found
    in the determination.

15. At paragraph 27 the judge found that the appellant was  a  genuine  and
    reliable witness.  He recorded the  fact  which  was  probably  not  in
    dispute that he was an intelligent man studying at degree level and  he
    recorded the appellant's evidence that he had carefully  completed  the
    application form, had twice checked the information provided by him and
    had taken the form to the student welfare advisor  to  check.   All  of
    this evidence was accepted by the judge including the evidence about Mr
    Poddar  who  had  checked  the  form.  Throughout  the  period  of  the
    appellant's residence, the judge continued

         "He had made timeous applications to extend his leave to remain. He
         was a person who was aware of the importance of such  applications.
         He had sufficient funds in his account throughout the period.

         I concluded that it was more probable than not that he had provided
         the correct information."

16. The reference to sufficient funds in his account throughout the  period
    was supported by bank statements and consequently the judge  was  faced
    with this dilemma. The appellant did not have the material that he  had
    completed on the application form that he had sent to the Secretary  of
    State.  It was only the Secretary of State that had  this  information.
    However, he had checked with the bank and the bank had  confirmed  that
    he had got funds and the bank statement itself shows  that  there  were
    funds in the relevant period.

17. The decision that was made to reject the application as  being  invalid
    was because payment had been declined, but we do not know on what basis
    that it had been declined.  We  know  that  there  were  funds  in  the
    account and so it was either because the appellant himself had provided
    inadvertently wrong information on the claim form or it was because the
    Secretary of State's official had  made an application using the  wrong
    information or the bank had itself made  a  mistake  when  it  declined
    payment when it should not have done so.

18. I think that, of those three possibilities, the bank's error appears to
    be less likely than any other because they  obviously  checked  through
    their records when they were asked to do so and I  am  sure  that,  had
    they made an error, then they would have readily admitted that.

19. So it was then a conflict between whether the Secretary of State was at
    fault or whether it was the appellant who was at  fault.   It  is  true
    that after the long passage of time the documentary evidence  has  been
    destroyed by the respondent but at the  relevant  time  the  respondent
    knew that there was an issue that was being taken about the payment  of
    money and it would therefore have been open to the Secretary  of  State
    to look at the form and to have seen whether it was the  appellant  who
    got it wrong or whether it was the Secretary of State who got it wrong.
     In either case, had the matter been actioned there and then, it  would
    have been possible to have remedied it within the time frame  which  is
    set out by the respondent for carrying out these checks.  Had that been
    the case, then there is no reason at all to doubt  that  the  appellant
    would have affected payment in the correct way as he had the  funds  to
    do so and every incentive to provide a valid mandate to  his  bank  for
    payment.

20. Hence the conclusion that was reached by the judge in paragraph 28 that
    it was more probable than not that he provided the correct  information
    was one which was open to the  judge.   But,  in  any  event,  had  the
    appellant made a mistake then it was a mistake he could have  rectified
    within the time permitted, had he known the circumstances in which  the
    payment was declined.

21. In these circumstances I am satisfied that it was open to the judge  to
    conclude that the public interest in refusing him leave to  remain  was
    limited and that it was proportionate to allow the appeal  outside  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis of circumstances as the judge had found.

22. For these reasons I do not accept the Secretary of  State's  contention
    in the grounds of appeal that the judge materially erred.  He was  able
    to resolve the issue as to payment and  did  so.   The  conclusion  was
    properly open to him.  Not only are his findings of  fact  unassailable
    but his conclusions on Article 8 are also sustainable.



DECISION

The Judge made no error on a point of law and the original determination  of
the appeal shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
