Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. V Mokal, instructed by Malik & Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against a decision  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Clarke promulgated on 29th September 2015, in which  he  allowed  the
       appeal by Mr. Sribalaratnam against the decision of the Secretary  of
       State for the Home Department of 7th January 2014 to refuse  to  vary
       his leave to remain in the UK.


    2. The appellant before me is  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department and the respondent to this appeal, is  Mr.  Sribalaratnam.
       However for ease of reference, in the course of this determination  I
       shall adopt the parties' status  as  it  was  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.  I shall in this determination, refer to  Mr  Sribalaratnam
       as the appellant, and the Secretary of State as the respondent.


Background


    3. The appellant is a national of  Sri  Lanka.   He  first  entered  the
       United Kingdom on 24th September  2007  with  leave  to  enter  as  a
       student until 31st January 2011. He was then granted further leave to
       remain as a Tier 1 Post Study Migrant until 21st  of  February  2013.
       On 21st February 2013 the appellant made an application for leave  to
       remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  under  the
       points based system. On 7th January  2014  a  decision  was  made  to
       refuse to vary leave to remain in the United Kingdom  and  to  remove
       the appellant by way of directions under  s.47  of  the  Immigration,
       Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The respondent awarded the appellant
       0 points under Appendix C (Maintenance (Funds))  of  the  Immigration
       Rules.  The respondent was not satisfied that the documents  provided
       by the appellant demonstrated that  he  has  been  in  possession  of
       sufficient funds for the specified period set out in Appendix C.  The
       respondent noted  that  the  appellant  had  provided  Barclays  Bank
       statements to demonstrate that he has been in possession of at  least
       �900.00 for a consecutive 90 day period, but  the  most  recent  bank
       statement provided by the appellant, was dated more than one calendar
       month prior to the date of  application.   The  respondent  concluded
       that the documents do not therefore meet the requirements of Appendix
       C.  That is, the documents do not show that the appellant   has  been
       in possession of sufficient funds for the required period.


    4. It was the decision of 7th January 2015 that was the subject  of  the
       appeal before the First-tier tribunal.





The decision of the First-tier Tribunal


    5. At paragraph [15] of his decision, the Judge notes that the issue for
       him to determine is whether, on the  balance  of  probabilities,  the
       appellant had at least �900.00  available  to  him  at  the  date  of
       application  as  required  by  paragraph  245DD(d)  and  Appendix   C
       paragraphs 1A (a) and (b).    The  Judge  reminds  himself  that  the
       appellant must have the funds available to him, and must have had the
       funds available to him for a consecutive 90-day period of time.   The
       Judge records at paragraph [16] of his decision the  submission  made
       on behalf of the respondent that the Immigration Rules  provide  that
       the end date of the 90-day period must be no  earlier  than  31  days
       before the date of application.


    6. The Judge refers to the evidence set out in the respondent's  bundle.
       He found at paragraph [20] of his decision that the  appellant  fails
       to meet the  requirements  the  requirements  of  paragraph  1(h)  of
       Appendix C.  That finding is not challenged  by  the  appellant.   At
       paragraph [21] of his decision the Judge refers to paragraph 245AA of
       the Immigration Rules and at paragraph [22] he refers to the evidence
       of the appellant that  he  had  sent  all  his  bank  statements  and
       documents to the respondent.  At paragraph [27] the Judge states:


             "27.  On the balance of probabilities, I  do  not  accept  the
             appellants  evidence  that  he  submitted  a   printout   that
             subsequently became lost. I fail to see why the appellant  did
             not go to his branch before he submitted his full application,
             obtain  the  crucial  printout  and  submit  all  three   bank
             statements together. I also find that the grounds of appeal do
             not raise that the crucial bank statement has  been  lost.  If
             the  appellant  had  submitted  the  printout,  I  would  have
             expected him to have identified the issue in  the  grounds  of
             appeal and to raise the issue  specifically  at  the  earliest
             opportunity....."


    7. Again, the finding set out at paragraph [27] of the decision  is  not
       challenged by the appellant.  At paragraphs [28] and [29]  the  Judge
       rejected  the  submission  made  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that
       paragraph 245AA(a) of the Immigration Rules applies because the  bank
       statements were a sequence of documents and the respondent  ought  to
       have requested the missing bank statement.  Again, that is a  finding
       that is not challenged by the appellant.


    8. At paragraph [30] of his decision, the Judge sets out the  submission
       made by the appellant that  the respondent should  have  enquired  if
       there was a later statement  to  show  that  he  had  access  to  the
       requisite funds at the date of application in  accordance  with  Home
       Office policy.   The Judge refers to a series of  letters  that  were
       set out in the appellants bundle addressed to other individuals,  but
       relied upon by the appellant to demonstrate that the respondent  does
       in fact to make requests for additional information before a decision
       is made. At paragraph [31] of his decision, the Judge states:


             "31.  ...  I  place  great  weight  on  the  said  letters  as
             indicative  of  a  policy  within  the  Home  Office  to  seek
             additional information in certain cases. I  remind  myself  of
             the respondents evidential flexibility  policy  which  ran  in
             tandem with Paragraph 245AA and I find that the  appellant  in
             line with the said policy should have been asked if he  had  a
             further bank statements to cover the relevant period.  I  find
             that having satisfied the requirements  of  the  points  based
             system it would not have been speculative on the part  of  the
             respondent to ask for additional bank statements  pursuant  to
             the respondents policy that was clearly being applied in other
             cases."


    9. The Judge allowed the appeal to the limited extent that the  impugned
       decision is not in accordance with the law and he remitted the matter
       back to the respondent for a lawful decision to be made.


The appeal before me


   10. The respondent appeals on the grounds that the  Judge  erred  in  two
       respects.  First, the Judge erred in placing any  reliance  upon  the
       letters  relied  upon  by  the  appellant  to  demonstrate  that  the
       respondent does in fact  make  requests  for  additional  information
       before a decision is made.  The respondent submits that  the  letters
       relied upon by the appellant are inadmissible and that in any  event,
       it is impossible to tell from the production of the letters,  why  an
       official acting on behalf of the  respondent  might  have  asked  for
       further documentation.  Second, paragraph 245AA  of  the  Immigration
       Rules was introduced as a  substitute  for  the  previous  evidential
       flexibility policy that was  operated,  to  ensure  transparency  and
       consistency of decision making.


   11. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Hollingworth on 12th February 2016. The matter  comes  before  me  to
       consider whether or not  the  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Clarke involved the making of a material error of law,  and  if
       so, to remake the decision.


   12. Before me, Mr Whitwell adopts the  respondent's  grounds  of  appeal.
       He provided me with a copy of the "Points - based system - evidential
       flexibility" guidance, version 5 that was  valid  from  7th  November
       2013 until 28th March 2014.   He submits that the letters  that  were
       relied upon by the appellant are entirely irrelevant to this  appeal,
       and that the Judge erred in  placing  so  much  reliance  upon  those
       letters as being indicative of a policy within  the  Home  Office  to
       seek additional information in certain cases.   Mr  Whitwell  submits
       that there are certain circumstances in which additional  information
       might be asked for, but every  decision  is  fact  specific  and  one
       should not assume that just because information  is  requested  in  a
       particular case, it will be should  be  sought  in  every  case.   He
       submits that the policy is in the same terms as  paragraph  245AA  of
       the  Immigration  Rules  and  makes  provision  for  a  request   for
       additional evidence if there is reason  to believe that the  evidence
       exists. However it is limited to cases where  documents  are  missing
       from a series,  photocopies  of  the  required  documents  have  been
       received, or where a document is in the wrong format.


   13. Mr Whitwell submits that at paragraphs [28] and [29] of his decision,
       the Judge rejected the submission advanced on behalf of the appellant
       that paragraph 245AA of the immigration rules  apply  such  that  the
       respondent ought to have requested the missing bank  statement.    He
       submits that having found that  a  request  for  new  and  additional
       information is not covered under the provisions  of  paragraph  245AA
       immigration rules, that should have been the end of  the  matter  and
       the appeal should have been dismissed.   Mr  Whitwell  refers  me  to
       paragraphs [26] to [28] of the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in
       Mandalia -v- SSHD [2015] UKSC 59.  The Supreme Court referred to  the
       policy and at paragraph [28] Lord Wilson noted:


             "28. In that Mr Mandalia's application was made on 7  February
             2012, it is agreed that the  process  instruction  represented
             agency policy which in principle applied to it.  It should  be
             noted, however, that, in respect of all applications  made  on
             or  after  6  September  2012,  the  process  instruction  was
             withdrawn and the facility for a caseworker  to  seek  further
             information or evidence prior to  determining  an  application
             was instead  governed  by  a  new  rule,  namely  rule  245AA,
             inserted into the rules. The new rule, which was amended  with
             effect from 13 December 2012 and re-amended with effect from 1
             October 2013, seems to  give  caseworkers  substantially  less
             flexibility  than  did  the  process  instruction.   But   the
             encouragement to contact an applicant survives if  "[s]ome  of
             the documents in a sequence have been omitted (for example, if
             one bank statement from a series is missing)".


   14. In reply, Mr Mokal submits that paragraph [29] of the decision of the
       First-tier Tribunal Judge is not determinative  of  the  appeal.   He
       submits that in Gu -v- SSHD [2014] EWHC 1634, the process instruction
       had been withdrawn and the Court had to consider whether  a  document
       was omitted from a sequence or a bank statement, as here, was missing
       from a "series".


Decision as to Error of Law


   15. In my judgement, the Judge erred in placing  "great  weight"  on  the
       letters relied upon by the appellant as indicative of a policy within
       the Home Office to seek additional information in certain cases.   It
       is impossible in my judgement to discern  from  any  of  the  letters
       relied upon by the appellant, why it was that in the circumstances of
       those individual cases, a request for further information  was  made.
       The respondent, and the Tribunal on appeal, is required  to  consider
       whether the requirements of the immigration  rules  are  met  in  the
       particular application or appeal being considered.  It  adds  nothing
       to say that another application that is entirely unconnected  to  the
       application under consideration, has been dealt with in a  particular
       way, without some detailed scrutiny of the facts and circumstances of
       that other application.


   16. However,  the  evidential  flexibility  policy  relied  upon  by  the
       appellant was in force as at the date of the respondent's decision on
       7th January 2014.  The policy came into force in  March  2013,  which
       was a month after the appellant's application had been made,  and  it
       was in force when the respondent made her decision.


   17. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found at paragraph [29] of his decision
       that the two bank statements that were  submitted  by  the  appellant
       were freestanding and not part of a sequence in a larger bundle.  The
       judge found that a request for new and additional information was not
       covered under the provisions of paragraph 245AA.


   18. I reject the submission that the finding by the  Judge  at  paragraph
       [29] of the decision, that paragraph 245AA of the  Immigration  Rules
       was not  met,  was  determinative  of  the  appeal.   The  evidential
       flexibility policy that the  Judge  went  on  to  consider  expressly
       states that the policy  is  about  evidential  flexibility  "when  an
       application has missing evidence or there is  a  minor  error  on  an
       application". This, in my judgement, is  much  wider  than  the  very
       particular  circumstances  set  out  in  paragraph   245AA   of   the
       Immigration Rules.  I reject the submission that paragraph  245AA  of
       the Immigration Rules was introduced as a substitute for the previous
       evidential flexibility policy.  It is plain  that  the  guidance  has
       remained in place,  and  indeed  has  been  updated  as  guidance  to
       caseworkers after  paragraph  245AA  of  the  Immigration  Rules  was
       introduced.


   19.  The  Judge  found  at  paragraph  [31]  of  his  decision  that  the
       respondent, in line with her policy, should have asked the  appellant
       if he had a further bank statement to submit, to cover  the  relevant
       period.  The Judge found that the appellant had satisfied  the  other
       requirements of the points based system, and thus it would  not  have
       been speculative on the  part  of  the  respondent  to  ask  for  the
       additional bank statement.


   20. The Judge erred in concluding that the letters  relied  upon  by  the
       appellant were indicative of a policy within the Home Officer to seek
       additional information in certain cases, but in my judgement that  is
       not a material error because the Judge was entitled to have regard to
       the evidential flexibility policy.  The approach and decision of  the
       Judge is consistent  with  the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in
       Mandalia -v- SSHD [2015] UKSC 59.  The Supreme Court  held  that  the
       respondent had acted unlawfully in refusing an application for  leave
       to remain on  the  grounds  that  bank  statements  provided  by  the
       applicant showed that he had held sufficient funds for a period of 22
       consecutive days rather than the 28 days required by the  Immigration
       Rules.  The  Supreme  Court  held  that  properly  interpreted,   the
       respondent's instructions to caseworkers obliged them first  to  have
       invited the applicant to repair the deficit in his evidence.


   21. It follows that the appeal by the  Secretary  of  State  against  the
       decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Clarke is dismissed
