Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Coleman of Counsel instructed by Nandy & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Cameron promulgated on 4 July 2018  dismissing  the  Appellant's  human
    rights appeal against a decision of the Respondent dated 28  June  2017
    refusing leave to remain in the United Kingdom.


2.   The Appellant is a citizen of Kenya born on 30 September 1962.  She  is
    married to Mr Benson Gitonga.  The couple were married in Kenya  on  15
    May 1983.  They have had four children who are all now grown up and, as
    far as I am aware, continue to reside in Kenya - they do not reside  in
    the United Kingdom.


3.   Mr Gitonga arrived in the United Kingdom in November 1995  and  made  a
    claim for asylum.  Nothing is said in any of the materials before me as
    to the outcome of that application for asylum, but  nonetheless  it  is
    not disputed that he  was  subsequently  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom on 28 January 2003. He is  now  a  British
    citizen.


4.   The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 14  March  2003  and  on
    the following day claimed  asylum.   The  application  for  asylum  was
    refused on 23 March 2003 and a subsequent appeal dismissed in May 2003.
     The Appellant became 'appeal rights exhausted' on 4 June 2003.  It was
    not until November 2011 that the Appellant made further submissions  in
    respect of her status in the United Kingdom.   These  submissions  were
    rejected on  5  September  2014.   The  Appellant  again  made  further
    submissions, treated as a human  rights  claim,  on  8  December  2014,
    culminating in the decision that is the subject of these proceedings.


5.   The Appellant's human rights claim was refused for reasons set  out  in
    the Respondent's 'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL')  dated  28  June
    2017.


6.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


7.   The appeal was dismissed for the reasons out in the Decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Cameron promulgated on 4 July 2018.


8.   The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.   The
    application was refused in the first instance  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Buchanan on 27 September 2018.  However, permission to appeal was
    then granted by Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam on 3 December 2018.


9.   The grant of permission to appeal was on a  relatively  narrow  ground.
    In material part the grant of permission is in these terms:

         "It is not arguable that there is contradiction in the Judge having
         accepted that the Appellant and husband were credible and that  the
         evidence did not establish insurmountable obstacles.


         It may be that the judge was not assisted  by  the  representative,
         however, it arguable that the judge accepted that the appellant met
         the substantive maintenance requirements of the rules at  the  date
         of the hearing and it is arguable that the  judge  did  not  factor
         this into the assessment of proportionality.  Permission is granted
         on this ground only".




10.  In this context I note the grounds of appeal  which  in  material  part
    are in the following terms:

         "The Judge found the witnesses truthful.  The  Appellant's  husband
         gave evidence of earnings over �2,000 per month (see paragraph 30).
          This was supported by bank statements.  Whilst  evidence  of  this
         level of earning was for the 3 months  prior  to  the  hearing  the
         Judge was not bound by consideration of specified  evidence.   This
         was an appeal outside the Rules and as such  it  was  open  to  the
         Judge to consider  whether  the  Appellant's  husband  earned  over
         �18,600 from the  available  evidence  and  not  from  required  to
         satisfy Appendix FM.  Having accepted the Appellant's  evidence  of
         his earnings as truthful it was not open to the Judge  to  conclude
         that the claim as to the  level  of  earnings  was  not  made  out.
         Simply put the Appellant's husband said he earned enough to satisfy
         the financial requirement.  The Judge believed him and this  should
         have been enough.


         This error has arguably had a material effect in  relation  to  the
         Agyarko and Chikwamba submission.  Having  found  that  the  couple
         were in a subsisting relationship, lawfully  married  and  able  to
         satisfy the financial Rules the Judge may have gone on to allow the
         appeal" (Grounds at paragraph 3).


11.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge heard evidence from  the  Appellant,  her
    husband and a further witness who  had  known  the  Appellant  and  the
    husband for fifteen years.  In what in  my  judgment  is  a  manifestly
    careful and thorough decision, the Judge fully reviewed  the  materials
    before him, and made findings of primary fact which were in large  part
    favourable to the  Appellant's  case.   Indeed  there  is  no  specific
    challenge to any of the Judge's  primary  findings,  and  there  is  no
    suggestion in the grounds of  appeal  to  the  effect  that  the  Judge
    omitted any material evidence.


12.  It may be seen that the Judge was satisfied in respect of the  couple's
    relationship and the financial support that Mr Gitonga provided:

         "Taking into account all of the  evidence  available  to  me  I  am
         satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant and Mr
         Gitonga are married and that they are in a genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship.  I accept his evidence that  he  fully  supports  his
         wife" (paragraph 43).




13.  At paragraphs 44 and 45 the Judge discounted the possibility  that  the
    Appellant had benefited from public funds by reference to NHS treatment
    or otherwise.

         "On the evidence available to me I cannot make a finding  that  she
         has received public benefits when she was  not  entitled  to  them"
         (paragraph 45).
    (In this context  see  the  Appellant's  assertion  that  she  had  not
    received benefits recorded at paragraph 37.)


14.  Notwithstanding these favourable findings of primary  fact,  the  Judge
    did not accept the contention that there were insurmountable  obstacles
    to family life together in Kenya, and did  not  accept  the  contention
    that there were significant obstacles to the Appellant's  reintegration
    to Kenya: see  paragraphs  54  and  57.   As  noted  in  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal, there  is  no  inconsistency  between  the  Judge
    accepting the credibility of the Appellant and her husband  in  respect
    of their relationship and  circumstances,  but  not  finding  in  their
    favour in  respect  of  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  or
    significant obstacles to reintegration.


15.  The Judge, having considered these matters in  respect  of  the  Rules,
    then directed himself to an evaluation  pursuant  to  the  five  Razgar
    questions: see  paragraph  58.   The  Judge  then  made  the  following
    observations:

         "59. The public interest is in general in the removal of those here
             who have no lawful right to remain.   Although  the  Appellant
             has been in this country for over 15 years she  came  to  this
             country  using  a  false  passport  and   after   her   asylum
             application was refused she did not  seek  to  regularise  her
             status until 2010.   The  Appellant's  position  is  therefore
             precarious in the terms of section 117B.


         60.  The Appellant's partner was aware of her  precarious  position
             when she came to this country".




16.  I pause to note that although it was no part of the basis of the  grant
    of permission to appeal,  there  was  nonetheless  a  brief  discussion
    before me in respect of the relevance of 'precariousness' in  light  of
    the particular wording of section 117B(4) and section  117B(5)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   In  particular,  my
    attention was directed to the wording of section 117B(4)(b) -   "Little
    weight should be given to ... a relationship formed with  a  qualifying
    partner that is established by a person at a time when the person is in
    the United Kingdom unlawfully".  In this regard Mr  Coleman  questioned
    whether or not it could be  said  that  the  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and her husband was 'formed' at a time when the Appellant was
    in the United Kingdom unlawfully in circumstances  where  the  marriage
    had taken place a considerable number of years prior to the Appellant's
    entry to the United Kingdom. Mr Tufan  directed  my  attention  to  the
    observations of the Tribunal in respect of these provisions in the case
    of Rajendran [2016] UKUT 138 (IAC), to the effect  that  precariousness
    is an established part of Article  8  jurisprudence;  accordingly,  the
    fact that any particular relationship does not come within the  express
    ambit of the  provisions  under  section  117B  would  not  negate  the
    relevance of considering the 'precarious' or unlawful status of a party
    to a relationship.  On that basis, and in any event,  in  my  judgement
    even if it might be said  that  the  Appellant's  relationship  is  not
    within the ambit of the wording  of  section  117B(4),  the  precarious
    nature  of  her  status  is  still  relevant  to  a  consideration   of
    proportionality, and is anyway within the ambit of  section  117B(1)  -
    the public interest in the maintenance of effective immigration control
    weighs against  advantage  being  secured  pursuant  to  precarious  or
    unlawful presence absent very particular reasons or circumstances.


17.  In the alternative I would  have  been  minded  to  accept  Mr  Tufan's
    submission  that  the  reference  to   the   'establishment'   of   the
    relationship in the United Kingdom -  "a  relationship  formed  with  a
    qualifying partner that is established by a person at a time  when  the
    person is  in  the  United  Kingdom"  -  would  cover  the  Appellant's
    circumstances where she had been apart from her husband  at  least  for
    the period from November 1995  until  March  2003.  There  had  been  a
    significant fracture in the relationship in  terms  of  being  in  each
    other's presence  until  after  the  Appellant's  arrival  in  the  UK;
    thereafter mutual family life was established in the UK, but at a  time
    when the Appellant's status  at  the  very  least  precarious,  if  not
    unlawful.  However, ultimately this diverting discussion forms no  part
    of my overall conclusion herein because it is not within the  ambit  of
    the grant of permission to appeal.


18.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge, having made reference  to  such  matters
    at paragraphs 59 and 60 (as quoted above),  went  on  to  give  further
    consideration to the Appellant's case under Article 8 as a freestanding
    provision, before reaching the following conclusions:

         "67. After taking into account all of the factors  put  forward  on
             behalf of the Appellant  and  also  taking  into  account  the
             references in support from friends but taking into account the
             fact that the Appellant spent her  formative  years  in  Kenya
             including a period of some seven  or  eight  years  after  her
             husband came to this country and that both she and her husband
             were aware of her precarious immigration status when she  came
             to this country using a false passport, together with the fact
             that I do  not  accept  that  there  would  be  insurmountable
             obstacles to them being able to continue their family life  in
             Kenya should that be his wish, I am  not  satisfied  that  the
             Appellant has shown that there  are  compelling  circumstances
             which would warrant a grant of leave outside of the Rules.


         68.  I am satisfied that the  Respondent's  decision  is  itself  a
             lawful one  and  that  when  the  factors  in  favour  of  the
             Appellant are balanced against the Respondent's legitimate aim
             that the balance falls in favour of the  Respondent  and  that
             the  decision  to  refuse  the  Appellant's   application   is
             proportionate to their legitimate aim of the maintenance of an
             effective immigration policy".




19.  The challenge that  is  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  pursuant  to  the
    limited basis of the grant  of  permission  to  appeal  is  focused  on
    paragraphs 65 and 66 of the Decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  which
    are in these terms:

         "65. I have taken into account the factors set out in  relation  to
             exceptional  circumstances  by  the  court  in  Agyarko   from
             paragraphs  54  of  the  decision.   It  is  stated  that  her
             husband's earnings are in excess of the financial requirements
             and Mr Coleman has referred me to  entries  in  the  husband's
             recent bank statements.  Unfortunately, there is not with  the
             bundle before me wage slips to support  the  current  earnings
             and the P60 provided within the bundle for tax year to 5 April
             2018 shows his earnings at �9,096 which is clearly well  below
             the financial limits.


         66.   I  am  not  satisfied  that  I  have  been  given  sufficient
             information which would enable me to make a finding  that  the
             principles set out in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL  40  would  apply.
             If the husband's position is now such that  he  can  meet  the
             requirements of the Rules this is something which he can  show
             on an application made by the Appellant from Kenya.  I am  not
             satisfied that the evidence before me indicates that it  would
             be unreasonable to expect the Appellant to return to Kenya  to
             make such an application notwithstanding the  disruption  that
             this would cause to their current lifestyle".


20.  Further to this, it may be helpful if I make some  brief  reference  to
    what is said in respect of Chikwamba in the case of Agyarko [2017] UKSC
    11, bearing in mind that the grounds of appeal argue any error  on  the
    part of the Judge may be material  "in  relation  to  the  Agyarko  and
    Chikwamba submission".


         (i) Per Lord Justice Sales, giving the judgment  of  the  Court  of
         Appeal in Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440:

             "In Chikwamba, the House of Lords found that there would be  a
             violation of Article 8 if the applicant for leave to remain in
             that case were removed from the United Kingdom and  forced  to
             make an out-of-country application for leave  to  enter  which
             would  clearly  be  successful,  in  circumstances  where  the
             interference with her family life with her husband  associated
             with the removal could not be said to serve any good  purpose.
             It is possible to envisage a Chikwamba type  case  arising  in
             which Article 8 might require that leave to remain be  granted
             outside the Rules, even though it could not be said that there
             were insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  applicant  and  their
             spouse or partner continuing their family life overseas.   But
             in a case  involving  precarious  family  life,  it  would  be
             necessary   to   establish   that   there   were   exceptional
             circumstances to warrant such a  conclusion".  (paragraph  31)




         (ii) Per Lord Reed, giving the unanimous decision  of  the  Supreme
    Court:

             "Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or is entitled
             to  remain  in  the  UK   only   temporarily,   however,   the
             significance of this consideration depends on what the outcome
             of immigration control might otherwise be.  For example, if an
             applicant would  otherwise  be  automatically  deported  as  a
             foreign criminal, then the weight of the  public  interest  in
             his or her removal will generally be very  considerable.   If,
             on the other hand, an applicant - even if residing in  the  UK
             unlawfully - was otherwise certain  to  be  granted  leave  to
             enter, at least if an application were made from  outside  the
             UK, then there might be no  public  interest  in  his  or  her
             removal.   The  point  is  illustrated  by  the  decision   in
             Chikwamba v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department".
             (paragraph 51).




         (iii) 'Exceptional circumstances' are otherwise considered  by  the
         Supreme Court at paragraph 54 et seq..


21.  I have considerable reservations as to the  form  of  the  pleading  at
    paragraph 3 of the Grounds (quoted  above).  The  ground  is  seemingly
    premised on an assertion that the  Judge  accepted  that  Mr  Gitonga's
    earnings met the  required  level:  "Having  accepted  the  appellant's
    evidence of his [Mr Gitonga's] earnings  as  truthful...".   I  do  not
    accept that a careful reading of the Decision bears out such a premise:
    it seems to me that the favourable reference to the credibility of  the
    witnesses at paragraph 41 of the Decision appears primarily  to  be  in
    the context of the nature and history of the relationship  between  the
    Appellant and her husband; it  does  not  follow  that  the  Judge  was
    obliged to accept without more what was being advanced  in  respect  of
    the Appellant's husband's income; moreover, the contents  of  paragraph
    65 read as if the Judge felt he was unable to be satisfied  in  respect
    of the  claimed  level  of  earnings  in  the  absence  of  documentary
    evidence; this is reinforced by the observations at paragraph 66 to the
    effect that the Judge was not satisfied he had  been  given  sufficient
    information in respect of the essential point relied upon under.


22.  Be that as it may, it seems to me that this is not  really  the  point.
    What the Judge was  embarked  upon  at  paragraphs  65  and  66  was  a
    consideration of whether or not it could be said  that  an  application
    for leave to enter by the Appellant would "clearly be  successful",  or
    she would be "certain to be granted leave to enter"  -  to  borrow  the
    wording respectively of the Court of Appeal and the  Supreme  Court  in
    Agyarko. The materials relied upon before the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    this regard did not establish  the  requisite  premise  for  the  clear
    reasons identified by the First-tier Tribunal Judge at paragraph 65.


23.  Mr Coleman has taken me to the same materials during the course of  the
    hearing.

         (i) My attention was directed in the first instance to the  witness
         statement of the Appellant's husband  signed  on  24  May  2018  at
         paragraph 6 (Appellant's bundle before the First-tier  Tribunal  at
         pages 108-110).  It is  stated  that  the  Appellant's  husband  is
         currently employed as a security officer for a named company and is
         "in receipt of a substantial salary". However, the  salary  is  not
         specified.


         (ii) A letter from the employer dated  13  March  2017  (page  113)
         whilst confirming the fact of employment is silent on the  rate  of
         pay.


         (iii) I was also taken to the bank statements that were before  the
         First-tier Tribunal.  These are in two sections: there is a set  of
         statements covering the period from 3 December 2016 to 3 March 2017
         (pages 118-126); a second set of bank statements for the same  bank
         account covers the period from 3 March 2018 to 22 May  2018  (pages
         127-132).


         (iv) It may be seen that there is a gap of one  year  in  the  bank
         statements.


         (v) My  attention  was  directed  to  credits  to  the  Appellant's
         husband's account on 6 January,  16  February  and  3  March  2017,
         seemingly from the Appellant's husband's employer.  Necessarily  in
         circumstances  where  there  is  a  substantial  gap  in  the  bank
         statements and that employment is of some relative  history,  those
         matters are not directly pertinent  and  indeed  it  is  not  these
         particular payments but the ones shown in the second  set  of  bank
         statements to which Mr Coleman directed the attention of the First-
         tier Tribunal Judge.


         (vi) The latter statements show credits on 5 March 2018 in the  sum
         of �2,436, on 29 March 2018 for �200, on 6 April 2018  for  �1,532,
         on 19 April 2018 for �450, on 4 May 2018 for  �1,133,  and  11  May
         2018 for �547.  This shows an apparent income between 5 March  2018
         and 11 May 2018 of approximately �7,000.


         (vii) However, the First-tier Tribunal Judge noted the P60 for  the
         tax year ending April 2018 (page 114)  that  confirms  income  from
         employment in the period to 5 April 2018  of  �9,096.   Bearing  in
         mind the payment that appears in the bank  statements  on  5  March
         2018 was �2,436, this would suggest that  the  Appellant's  husband
         only earned something of the  order  of  �6,500  in  the  preceding
         eleven  months  (a  period  for  which  no  bank  statements   were
         produced).


         (viii) It may also be seen that there is no obvious  regularity  to
         the amounts being paid, or the dates of payment for the Appellant's
         husband's employment.  This  suggests  casual  rather  than  steady
         employment.


24.      Mr  Coleman  acknowledged  that  were  the  Appellant  to  make  an
    application for entry clearance from abroad it would be  necessary  not
    only to meet the Rules in respect of specified  evidence  but  also  to
    provide evidence of her sponsor's income for a period of at  least  six
    months.  The  materials  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  -
    irrespective of the specified evidence requirement - establish that the
    Appellant's husband had been earning over a period of six months  at  a
    rate commensurate with the  �18,600  threshold  under  the  Immigration
    Rules. In the circumstances it seems to me entirely unobjectionable for
    the Judge to have stated that he considered that he had not "been given
    sufficient information which would enable him to make  a  finding  that
    the principles set out in Chikwamba would apply".


25.  Further to  the  above,  and  for  the  avoidance  of  any  doubt,  the
    Appellant's husband's particular level of income at or about  the  date
    of the  hearing  was  seemingly  relied  upon  in  the  context  of  an
    'exceptional  circumstances'  Agyarko/Chikwamba  submission  -  as   is
    reinforced by the  pleading  in  the  grounds  of  appeal.   The  Judge
    otherwise accepted that the couple  were  essentially  self-supporting,
    that the Appellant's husband was able to support her without additional
    recourse to public funds, and that there had been no recourse to public
    funds. Accordingly, in the context of the overall Article 8  evaluation
    to  the  Judge  did  not  consider  it  an  adverse  feature  that  the
    Appellant's husband's income had not been demonstrated to be at a level
    and in a manner required to satisfy the  entry  clearance  Rules.   The
    specific  level  of  income  was  only  relevant  to  the  'exceptional
    circumstances'  consideration,  and  in  my  judgment  the   First-tier
    Tribunal Judge dealt with the matter entirely adequately.


26.  In the circumstances, and bearing in  mind  the  narrow  basis  of  the
    grant of permission to appeal, I can identify no error  of  law  and  I
    reject the challenge to the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.
