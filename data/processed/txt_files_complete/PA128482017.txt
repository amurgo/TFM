                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr Karnik, Whiterose Blackmans Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Algeria. He was born in 1977.

 2. The Respondent seeks to deport the Appellant because he has twice  been
    convicted of  using  a  false  instrument  (viz  using  fake  documents
    enabling him to work  illegally).    On  the  latter  occasion  he  was
    sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, a  sentence  which  triggered  the
    'automatic deportation' provisions in s32 of the United Kingdom Borders
    Act 2007.

 3. Before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Rose)  the  Appellant  sought  to
    resist  deportation  on  the  grounds  that  two  of  the  'exceptions'
    contained in s33 of the Act applied to him. First, he submitted that he
    has a well-founded fear of persecution in Algeria on grounds of a)  his
    membership of a particular social group (he is a gay man)  and  b)  his
    religious  belief  (he  has  converted  from  Sunni  to  Shi'a  Islam).
    Second,  he  submitted  that  his  deportation  would   amount   to   a
    disproportionate interference with his Article 8 private life, since he
    has lived in this country since 1997.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal on all  grounds.  For  the
    Appellant Mr Holt, who appeared at  the  initial  hearing  in  December
    2019,  conceded that he was unable to challenge the decision insofar as
    it relates to the Appellant's Article 8 rights, since he was unable  to
    show that the Appellant's long  residence  in  this  country  has  been
    lawful. This appeal is therefore solely concerned with  the  protection
    claim.




    Risk Arising from Homosexuality

 5. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the protection claim  insofar  as  it
    relates to the Appellant's sexuality.  Although it  accepted  that  the
    Appellant is gay, it found that the risk to LGBT individuals in Algeria
    comes principally from "third parties, specifically family members". It
    concluded:

          "While I  accept  that  Algeria  is  a  socially  and  religiously
         conservative country, the evidence before  me  indicates  that  the
         threat posed to LGBT individuals by the State or  Algerian  society
         at large does not reach the test for persecution"

 6. The Tribunal was further satisfied that the Appellant chooses to live a
    discreet lifestyle for reasons unrelated to a fear of  persecution  and
    the appeal was thereby dismissed on HJ (Iran) grounds.

 7. I am satisfied that in respect of both of these findings the First-tier
    Tribunal erred.

 8. The operative country guidance is OO (Gay Men) Algeria CG  [2016]  UKUT
    00065 (IAC). The Upper Tribunal there held that in  general  terms  the
    risk to gay men arises  only  from  their  family,  in  'honour'  based
    violence. The Tribunal did not consider that  the  level  of  hostility
    from society in general would reach the threshold of  persecution.   It
    was presumably this that the First-tier Tribunal was  referring  to  at
    its ï¿½31  when  it  referred  to  "third  parties,  specifically  family
    members".  So far so good.

 9. Two error arise thereafter. The first is that the  Tribunal  manifestly
    failed to address new evidence relied upon by the Appellant which  post
    dated OO by some three years, namely a report by Professor David Seddon
    which details recent instances of gay men  being  subject  to  "extreme
    physical  violence"  in  homophobic   attacks.    The   Appellant   had
    specifically relied on this  expert  evidence,  commissioned  for  this
    appeal, and yet no findings are made on it. It is an error  of  law  to
    fail to take material evidence into account.

10. The second error arises in the  failure  to  even  apply  the  existing
    country guidance:

         "a gay man from Algeria will be entitled  to  be  recognised  as  a
         refugee only if he shows that, due to his  personal  circumstances,
         it would be unreasonable and unduly harsh to expect him to relocate
         within Algeria to avoid persecution from family members, or because
         he has a  particular  characteristics  that  might,  unusually  and
         contrary to what is generally to be expected, give rise to  a  risk
         of attracting disapproval at the  highest  level  of  the  possible
         range of adverse responses from  those  seeking  to  express  their
         disapproval of the fact of his sexual orientation".

11. No clear findings  are  made  on  whether  the  Tribunal  accepted  the
    Appellant's account of being subject to severe beatings by  his  family
    in Algeria as a young teenager, violence inflicted  solely  because  of
    his sexual orientation. Although the Tribunal refers  to  the  evidence
    that the Appellant's parents had moved to  Syria  as  refugees  in  the
    1990s, the risk  assessment  is  still  incomplete  as  the  Appellants
    remaining family are still in Algiers.  No finding is made  on  whether
    he would be at risk from those family  members  today,  or  whether  he
    could reasonably be expected to internally relocate.  I would add  that
    there  was  here  a  further  discrete  error  of  fact  in  that   for
    understandable reasons the Appellant's parents  have  long  since  left
    Syria and returned to Algeria.

12. As to whether the Appellant would avoid any persecution in  Algeria  by
    acting "discreetly" here too the Tribunal fell into error. In  reaching
    its conclusion that he would do so it failed to have regard to material
    evidence in that in this country the Appellant is an active  member  of
    the gay community. It was his evidence that he  regularly  attends  gay
    bars and events and makes no attempt to hide  either  his  identity  or
    sexuality.   Further it also failed to notice that it  is  an  entirely
    moot point since his family already know  that  he  is  gay,  and  have
    already subjected him to serious harm as a result.

13. I therefore set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, in respect  of
    the risk arising from the Appellant's membership of a particular social
    group, aside.

14. In remaking the decision I direct myself to the questions posed by Lord
    Rodger at paragraph 82 of HJ (Iran)(FC) v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2010] UKSC 31:

         82. When an applicant applies for asylum on the ground of  a  well-
         founded fear of persecution because he is gay,  the  tribunal  must
         first ask itself whether it is satisfied on the evidence that he is
         gay, or that he would be treated as gay by potential persecutors in
         his country of nationality.

         If so, the tribunal must then ask itself whether it is satisfied on
         the available evidence that gay people who lived  openly  would  be
         liable to persecution in the applicant's country of nationality.

         If so, the tribunal must go on  to  consider  what  the  individual
         applicant would do if he were returned  to  that  country.  If  the
         applicant would in fact live openly and thereby  be  exposed  to  a
         real risk of persecution,  then  he  has  a  well-founded  fear  of
         persecution  -  even  if  he  could  avoid  the  risk   by   living
         "discreetly". If, on the other hand, the  tribunal  concludes  that
         the  applicant  would  in  fact  live  discreetly  and   so   avoid
         persecution, it must go on to ask itself why he would do so. If the
         tribunal  concludes  that  the  applicant  would  choose  to   live
         discreetly simply because that was how he  himself  would  wish  to
         live, or because of social pressures, e g, not wanting to  distress
         his parents or embarrass his friends, then his  application  should
         be rejected. Social  pressures  of  that  kind  do  not  amount  to
         persecution and the Convention does not  offer  protection  against
         them. Such  a  person  has  no  well-founded  fear  of  persecution
         because, for reasons that have nothing  to  do  with  any  fear  of
         persecution, he himself chooses to adopt a way of life which  means
         that he is not in fact liable to be persecuted because he  is  gay.
         If, on the other hand,  the  tribunal  concludes  that  a  material
         reason for the applicant living discreetly on his return would be a
         fear of the persecution which would  follow  if  he  were  to  live
         openly  as  a  gay  man,  then,  other  things  being  equal,   his
         application should be accepted. Such a person  has  a  well-founded
         fear of persecution. To reject his application on the  ground  that
         he could avoid the persecution by living  discreetly  would  be  to
         defeat the very right which the Convention exists to protect -  his
         right to live freely and openly  as  a  gay  man  without  fear  of
         persecution. By admitting him to asylum and allowing  him  to  live
         freely and openly as a gay man without  fear  of  persecution,  the
         receiving state  gives  effect  to  that  right  by  affording  the
         applicant a surrogate for the protection from persecution which his
         country of nationality should have afforded him.

15. The first matter to be determined is whether the Appellant is gay.  The
    First-tier Tribunal found that he was, and having  had  regard  to  the
    totality of the evidence before me, I am in complete agreement.

16. The next question is whether, having regard to the  country  background
    material, it could be said that gay people who try to  live  openly  in
    Algeria would face persecution.  The Tribunal in OO found that although
    homosexuality is  prohibited  by  law  in  Algeria  the  chance  of  an
    individual facing prosecution  is  negligible.  It  further  found  the
    evidence of gay men being assaulted by the police, or by  a  member  of
    the public in a homophobic attack to be "scant" and concluded:

         "The only risk of ill-treatment at a level  to  become  persecution
         likely to be encountered by a gay man in Algeria is at the hands of
         his own family, after they have discovered that he is gay".

17. That there is a risk of harm  from  family  members  is  a  proposition
    supported by  the  evidence  in  this  case.  In  the  Appellant's  own
    particular experience, the answer to Lord Rodger's second  question  is
    clearly yes. As a teenager he had been subjected to a continuous  month
    of severe beatings at the hands  of  his  father  and  family;  he  had
    thereafter been admitted to a mental hospital in an attempt  to  'cure'
    him.  He avoided further  harm  by  leaving  home  for  France.    What
    however, is the answer to Lord Rodger's question more generally?

18. To answer this question the Appellant relies on  evidence  which  post-
    dates OO. He submits that the situation  there  is  today  demonstrably
    very difficult for gay men, who as  well  as  continuing  to  face  the
    harassment and discrimination detailed in OO, do face physical abuse at
    the hands of hostile members of society. He  relies  on  the  following
    evidence:

              i) The report of Dr Seddon dated 26th July 2018. Dr Seddon was
                 the the witness in OO.  Although the Tribunal in that  case
                 did not accept all of his conclusions on the  evidence,  it
                 did accept that he is a well-placed expert:  he  has  given
                 evidence in a number  of  country  guidance  cases  and  in
                 matters before SIAC.  He is  a  social  scientist  who  has
                 specialised in Africa and the Middle East, with an emphasis
                 on the  Maghreb,  for  over  40  years.   He  has  spent  a
                 considerable amount of time in  Algeria,  and  maintains  a
                 network of Algerian contacts; he speaks French  and  Arabic
                 and to prepare his report Dr Seddon has drawn upon his  own
                 knowledge, the views of his contacts, contemporary articles
                 and reports including in the local press in  Algeria.    Dr
                 Seddon expressly states that he is aware of his  duties  to
                 the court and the application of the Ikarian Reefer test.

                 Dr Seddon  accepts  that  verifiable  reports  of  violence
                 against gay men are hard to find, precisely because of  the
                 nature  of  those  attacks,  where  the  perpetrators   are
                 unlikely  to  acknowledge  them,  and   the   victims   are
                 understandably reluctant to risk further harm by  reporting
                 them.  He draws however  on  reporting  from  a  number  of
                 sources to conclude that although hard  to  document,  such
                 violence is in fact occurring.  His  primary  source  is  a
                 report  recently  compiled   by   a   LGBTQI   organisation
                 (TransHomosDZ) alongside an  Algerian  human  rights  group
                 (the  Arab  Foundation  for  Freedoms  and  Equality).  The
                 central conclusions of  this  joint  report  are  that  gay
                 people in Algeria experience violence on a daily basis.  Dr
                 Seddon notes that examples are given of physical and sexual
                 violence occurring in a wide  range  of  contexts:  in  the
                 family, in public spaces, in  universities,  the  workplace
                 and in prison.  Dr Seddon suggests that it is evidence such
                 as this which has resulted in a number of  positive  first-
                 instance  asylum  decisions  in  Algerian  gay  cases,  the
                 guidance in  OO  notwithstanding  (he  lists  a  number  of
                 examples including that of Mr AL  who  was  attacked  by  a
                 group of men in a park in Algiers; he was beaten, called  a
                 prostitute and slashed with a razor blade)

             ii) Human Rights Watch World Report  2018  which  states  inter
                 alia that during 2015 several individuals were arrested for
                 same-sex  relations  and  that  anti-LGBT   rhetoric   from
                 politicians has led to an increase in homophobic harassment
                 and violence. Many LGBT leaders have fled the country,  and
                 instances of violence have been recorded  in  universities,
                 on the streets and in prisons as well as within families

            iii) An ILGA report dated 19th  March  2019  states  that  LGBTI
                 people are "repeatedly arrested for engaging in  consensual
                 same-sex acts, suffer abuse by  police  officers,  and  are
                 discriminated against in health and employment"

             iv) The United States' State Department report for 2017  states
                 that there were multiple arrests during the year for  same-
                 sex activity.  (This is of particular significance,  points
                 out Dr Seddon, because the US State Department have changed
                 their view on this matter  since  the  publication  of  the
                 report that was before the Tribunal in OO)

              v) Various news articles from December 2019 detailing how  the
                 Interior Minister Salahedine used the  epithets  "perverts"
                 "queers" and "homosexuals"  interchangeably  whilst  taking
                 about political opponents.

             vi) An article from the Jerusalem Post (and the 'LGBT Rights in
                 Algeria' Wikipedia page  which  cites  French  news  items)
                 concerning the February 2019 murder of bi-sexual university
                 student Asil Balata whose dormitory walls were  smeared  in
                 blood with the words 'he is gay' after his killing  by  two
                 men

19. I am satisfied, having had regard to  this  material  before  me,  that
    homosexual men  openly  identifying  as  such  in  Algeria  would  face
    persecution.  I appreciate that the careful analysis conducted  by  the
    Tribunal in OO led to the conclusion that there are very few verifiable
    attacks. The evidence before  me,  some  four  years  later,  tends  to
    indicate that there are two reasons for that. First that there are  few
    precisely  because  homosexual  men   are   concealing   their   sexual
    orientation from society in fear inter alia of such attack, and  second
    because when such violence does occur the victims will very often  stay
    silent because  they  are  fearful  of  the  consequences  should  they
    approach the authorities for protection.   This leads me to  the  final
    question posed by Lord Rodger.

20. The Appellant himself has  spent  the  past  twenty-five  years  living
    openly as a gay man, first in Paris and then in  London.  He  does  not
    conceal his sexual identity in any way.  He  has  formed  relationships
    here with a number of men, although to his regret none  of  these  have
    been long-term, something he attributes  to  his  lack  of  immigration
    status and the fact that he has had to lead a 'double  life'  with  the
    assumption of the false identity which led to his convictions.

21. The Appellant was unequivocal in his evidence before me  about  how  he
    would behave should he be returned to Algeria. He could not contemplate
    living his life there as he does  here,  for  fear  that  he  would  be
    physically attacked or  even  killed.   Such  subjective  fear  is  not
    fanciful, as the murder of Asil Balata illustrates.  Accordingly I find
    that the tests in HJ, applied to  this  matter,  demonstrate  that  the
    Appellant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Algeria for reasons
    of his membership of a particular social group.

22. If I am wrong and the evidence before me  does  not  justify  departure
    from the country guidance in OO, I am nevertheless satisfied  that  the
    Appellant qualifies for refugee status. That is because he has a  well-
    founded fear of persecution by  his  family.  There  is  no  reason  to
    believe that the animus they exhibited towards him as a teenager  would
    have diminished - his family subjected  him  to  a  number  of  extreme
    serious  harms  including   prolonged   and   severe   beating,   false
    imprisonment and committal to a mental  institution.   I  am  satisfied
    that there is good reason to believe that  such  harms  remain  a  real
    risk.  I am further satisfied that the Appellant  would  be  unable  to
    turn to the Algerian authorities for assistance and protection in these
    circumstances: indeed the Respondent expressly accepts that  to  be  so
    [see paragraph 42 OO].  There remains the matter  of  internal  flight.
    The Appellant is an individual who has suffered  extreme  serious  harm
    because of his sexual orientation. In addition  to  the  harms  visited
    upon him by members of his own family, the Appellant was at the age  of
    16 raped by an older man, an assault for which he received  no  redress
    or recovery assistance, and which continues to haunt him today.  He  is
    someone who has escaped that traumatic past to rebuild his  life  in  a
    country where he can be open about who he is. In assessing  whether  it
    would be 'unduly harsh' to expect him to relocate within Algeria  these
    are the personal characteristics that I  must  take  into  account.  In
    contrast to the 'average' Algerian gay man discussed in OO,  who  might
    reasonably be expected to tolerate living 'discreetly' this  is  a  gay
    man who has suffered direct and serious violence as  a  result  of  his
    sexuality, and knows full well what it is  like  to  be  able  to  live
    openly without fear of such harm. The personal consequences for him  of
    going to live in a strange town in Algeria, and repressing his identity
    once more, are likely to be profound. He may be able  to  work  and  to
    find somewhere to live but his life would  be  far  from  what  he  now
    regards as 'normal'. In all of the circumstances that would  be  unduly
    harsh.  I therefore re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing  the
    Appellant's appeal on this ground.




    Risk Arising from Religious Affiliation

23. It is the Appellant's evidence that  he  was  brought  up  as  a  Sunni
    Muslim, but since he has come to live in  the  United  Kingdom  he  now
    regards himself as Shi'a.   Permission to appeal to this  Tribunal  was
    granted  specifically  on  the  grounds  challenging   the   First-tier
    Tribunal's approach to this matter.  At  ï¿½34  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    accepts that the Appellant has converted to Shi'a Islam; it goes on  to
    find that he "could and would" live  discreetly  in  this  capacity  in
    Algeria.   At no point does the Tribunal appear  to  consider  why  the
    Appellant might choose to do so. In doing so it fails to ask the second
    of the questions posed by Lord Rodger in  the  'tests'  in  HJ  (Iran):
    would the claimant  face  persecution  if  he  chose  to  live  openly?
    Without undertaking that  analysis  the  Tribunal  could  not  sensibly
    address the subsequent question of whether the  threat  of  persecution
    played a material part in the Appellant's choice to  conceal  his  true
    faith from others around him.  Was that error material?

24. There does not appear to be any dispute that the Appellant now  regards
    himself as Shi'a, although by his own estimation this appears to  be  a
    cultural affiliation rather than a deeply religious  one:  in  fact  he
    describes himself as "more of an atheist". There is no evidence that he
    attends mosque or Shi'a prayers regularly. Nor is  there  any  evidence
    before me that Shi'a Muslims  experience  persecution  in  Algeria.  Dr
    Seddon writes that they are socially discriminated against, and that in
    the case of the Appellant the confluence of his sexual orientation  and
    religious adherence may lead  to  "particular  hostility"  towards  the
    latter.  Accordingly I find that whilst the Appellant is Shi'a, he  has
    not demonstrated that living openly as a Shi'a in  Algeria  would  give
    rise to a real risk of serious harm. I accept  Dr  Seddon's  view  that
    Shi'a Muslims face discrimination and harassment,  and  that  this  may
    well contribute towards any internal flight alternative  being  'unduly
    harsh' (see above) but I dismiss the appeal under this discrete head.




    Anonymity

25. The Appellant is entitled to refugee status.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decision and Directions

26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for error of law  and
    I set it aside.




27. I remake the decision in the appeal as follows: "the appeal is  allowed
    on protection grounds".



28. There is an order for anonymity.
