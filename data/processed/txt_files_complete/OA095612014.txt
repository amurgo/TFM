For the Appellant:     Mr A Islam, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. For ease of comprehension, the parties are referred to by their  status
    before the First-tier Tribunal.






 2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Khawar  allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the Entry Clearance Officer's  decision  dated  6  August  2014
    notifying the Appellant of the refusal of her application for leave  to
    enter as the spouse of a settled  partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    immigration rules. That decision was appealed by way of section  82  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.






 3.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  its  decision   allowing   the
    Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision on 12 August 2015.







 4.  The  Respondent  appealed  against  that  decision  and  was   granted
    permission to appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson. The  grounds
    upon which permission to  appeal  was  granted  may  be  summarised  as
    follows:


      a) It is arguable that  the  judge  should  not  have  considered  the
         Appellant's oral evidence that he receives wages  from  his  second
         job in cash as only wages paid into a bank account and appearing on
         the bank statements  may  be  counted  towards  his  gross  income,
         whereas the P60s and the summary of the sponsor's annual tax return
         had not been submitted with the application and were not before the
         decision maker.






 5. It is of note that both parties were represented before the  First-tier
    Tribunal, and neither party, particularly the  Respondent  raised  this
    issue prior to these grounds of appeal.





Error of Law


 6. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.  My decision is  that
    there is no error of law in the First-tier Judge's  determination.   My
    reasons for so finding are as follows.






 7. The Respondent argues in her sole ground of appeal that  the  Appellant
    may only  rely  on  the  Sponsor's  income  which  is  demonstrated  by
    specified evidence contained in Appendix FM-SE.  At  paragraph  14  the
    judge is complained to have had regard to the Sponsor's  evidence  that
    he receives his wages from his second job with Deshi Catering  in  cash
    but that this is not  paid  into  his  bank  account.   The  Respondent
    submitted that only wages paid into  a  bank  account  and  which  also
    appear on the statement may be  counted  towards  the  Sponsor's  gross
    income and as specified documentary evidence. The key to  this  appeal,
    as Ms Fijiwala made clear, is whether bank statements are not specified
    evidence because if they show one form of employed income paid via bank
    transfer (i.e. BACS), but cease to be specified evidence  because  they
    do not show entries for income paid in cash, because  the  cash  income
    was not deposited.






 8. Based upon  that  premise,  the  Respondent  also  complained  that  at
    paragraph 18 of the determination the judge had regard to  P60s  and  a
    computation summary of the Appellant's annual tax return for  the  year
    ended 2013 to 2014 but that it was not open to  the  judge  to  make  a
    finding that the income threshold requirement was met  based  on  those
    documents or the credibility of the Sponsor because  neither  of  those
    could make up for  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  had  not  submitted
    specified documentary evidence.






 9. In reply to my questions Ms Fijiwala accepted that but for the lack  of
    a bank statement showing the cash income being paid into  that  account
    the consideration of other documents such as  a  P60  as  well  as  the
    Sponsor's evidence regarding his gross income could in  fact  be  taken
    into account given that it pertained to the  date  of  the  application
    and/or the date of the decision.






10. Mr Islam in reply relied upon Appendix  FM-SE  1(k)  and  1(m)  but  Ms
    Fijiwala maintained that this could not assist the Appellant.






11. Appendix FM-SE 1(k) states as follows:


         Where the gross (pre-tax) amount of any income cannot  be  properly
         evidenced, the net (post-tax) amount  will  be  counted,  including
         towards a gross income requirement.





12. Subparagraph 1(m) of Appendix FM-SE reads as follows:


         Cash income on which the correct tax has been paid may  be  counted
         as income under this Appendix, subject to the  relevant  evidential
         requirements of this Appendix.





13. Mr Islam further relied upon an alternate paragraph of  Appendix  FM-SE
    which he submitted evidenced the ability to exercise  discretion  which
    the Entry Clearance Officer had failed to do and  which  supported  the
    judge's decision.  That is to be found at paragraph D(e) of Appendix FM-
    SE which states as follows:


         Where the decision maker is satisfied that there is a valid  reason
         why a specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g. because it  is
         not issued in a particular country or has been permanently lost, he
         or she may exercise discretion not to apply the requirement for the
         document(s) or to request alternative or additional information  or
         document(s) be submitted by the applicant.





14. Dealing with those rules in turn, in respect of paragraph 1(k) Mr Islam
    was unable to provide exact figures as to the net post-tax amount  that
    could be counted towards a gross income  requirement  and  consequently
    that submission can go no further.






15. In relation to paragraph 1(m) and the cash income on which correct  tax
    has been paid, in that regard I note in particular that  at  paragraphs
    18 and 19  of  the  determination  the  judge  did  consider  that  the
    Appellant's computation/summary of his annual tax return for  the  year
    ended 2013-14 shows that his gross income for that year was �19,770.48.
     The judge also noted in particular that there was no challenge to  the
    information contained in those documents by the Home Office  Presenting
    Officer. The judge went on to also note that the Presenting Officer did
    not seek to challenge the submission that the Sponsor had paid his  tax
    in accordance with the aforesaid tax  summary  for  2013-14.   In  that
    regard cash income as is stated in paragraph 1(m) on which tax has been
    paid may be counted as income under this  Appendix.   Consequently  the
    cash income contributing towards the gross figure of  �19,770.48  could
    have been counted towards this income but only subject to the  relevant
    evidential requirements of this Appendix.






16. That brings me back to  Ms  Fijiwala's  submission  that  the  evidence
    contained in the bank statement, solely for  want  of  entries  showing
    deposits of cash income (notwithstanding that it contained entries  for
    alternate employment), was  for  that  reason  alone  not  a  specified
    document.






17. In my view this submission is  wholly  misguided.  That  is  because  a
    document is specified by virtue of the fact that it appears in the list
    of documents that is to be submitted.  Appendix FM-SE in this regard at
    paragraph 2C refers to personal bank statements, correspondence for the
    same periods as the payslips at paragraph 2A (which Ms Fijiwala accepts
    were submitted) showing that the salary had been paid into  an  account
    in the name of the person or the name of the person and  their  partner
    jointly.  Whilst the salary paid in the account is shown only  for  one
    employment, the  personal  bank  statement  does  not  cease  to  be  a
    specified document merely because it does not show  salary  being  paid
    into the account for the second employment.  That  would  result  in  a
    confused  and  discrepant  scenario  whereby  the  document  could   be
    specified for one income but not specified for the other  income.  This
    would have the unattractive effect of convoluting the Immigration Rules
    and distorting the simple concept of a specified document by  reference
    to what it contained as opposed to what it actually is. It has been oft
    complained by the Court of Appeal that the Rules do  not  require  such
    assistance given that they are already  "byzantine"  (see  Pokhriyal  v
    Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home   Department [2013]   EWCA   Civ
    1568 per Jackson, LJ at [4]) and "rebarbative" in nature (see Singh v
    Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home   Department [2015]   EWCA   Civ
    74 per Underhill LJ at [59]).






18. Consequently, in light of my view that the specified documents were not
    missing as the Entry Clearance Officer believed, the decision  is  free
    from material error and should stand.






19. Even if I am wrong in that regard and a document is specified only when
    it is in a form  showing  that  a  bank  statement  containing  audited
    financial entries for a second form of salaried income was not provided
    (even though it was specified for the first form of income where it did
    contain evidence of deposits from that salaried employment),  paragraph
    D(e) of Appendix FM-SE, which Mr Islam relies upon, makes clear that if
    there is a valid reason why a specified document  cannot  be  supplied;
    and in this case I find in the alternative that a  valid  reason  would
    clearly be that the document  is  not  specified  purely  for  want  of
    showing entries for cash  deposits  given  that  the  sponsor  did  not
    deposit his income into the account, can and clearly  should  be  taken
    into account by an Entry Clearance Officer given that they can exercise
    a discretion not to apply the requirement for such a document.






20. If the requirement is of such a specific  nature  and  more  convoluted
    than the Rules appear to suggest at FM-SE  2(c)  then  I  am  fortified
    further in this decision.






21. I also add that the entire basis for the document not  being  specified
    according to Ms Fijiwala was that  there  is  a  need  which  the  rule
    provides for, according  to  the  Immigration  Directorate  Instruction
    Appendix FM Section 1.7 at paragraph 3.1.5 which states as follows:


         "...those wishing to rely on cash income to sponsor an  application
         subject to the financial requirement may need  to  change  the  way
         they manage their money and bank the full net amount so  that  they
         can then rely on the gross amount of that income in sponsoring  the
         application".





22. If, as the paragraph  indicates,  there  is  a  need  to  maintain  the
    integrity of the system for all genuine Applicants  and  Sponsors  that
    their cash income from employment be corroborated, this in my view will
    not apply to paragraph 1(m) of Appendix FM-SE (as opposed to 1(n) of FM-
    SE) for the reason that 1(m) makes clear that it applies to cash income
    on which the correct tax has been paid. That is why  cash  income  upon
    which tax has been paid may nonetheless be counted as income under this
    Appendix despite this need.  This must follow given that the payment of
    tax upon the cash income (which was not deposited into a bank  account)
    has nonetheless been verified by HMRC and tax was paid upon  the  gross
    income, which addresses the need that Ms  Fijiwala  submits  implicitly
    exists at paragraph 1(n).






23. Given  my  references  to  the  judge's  determination  concerning  the
    acceptance of correct payment of tax, which was not challenged  by  the
    Respondent, this reinforces the fact that cash income was rightly taken
    into account by the First-tier Judge under the Rules.






24. As noted above, Ms Fijiwala on behalf of the Respondent submitted  that
    the sole issue was the lack  of  a  specified  document  and  that  the
    Appellant could submit a further application now that the  sponsor  has
    begun depositing his cash income. However, given that the  Sponsor  has
    changed his way of banking and deposited his cash income, Ms Fijiwala's
    submission belies the fact that the sponsor and Appellant's family life
    will undoubtedly be interrupted were there to be a further  application
    and a further delay which does not sit well  with  the  fact  that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer can and  ought  to  have  exercised  discretion
    under Appendix FM-SE D(e).





Decision


25. The decision of the First-tier shall stand and is hereby affirmed.






26. The First-tier Tribunal did not make a fee award and I  have  not  been
    asked to depart from that decision.
