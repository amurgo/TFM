                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Frankish, promulgated on 25th August 2016, following a hearing at
    Bennett  House,  Stoke-on-Trent  on   18th   August   2016.    In   the
    determination, the judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon
    the Respondent Secretary of State, subsequently applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Afghanistan, who was born on [  ]
    1997.  He appeals against the decision of the Respondent  Secretary  of
    State dated 16th July 2015, on the basis of having a  British  citizen
    child, J, born of a British citizen mother, D L M, with whom he  is  no
    longer in a relationship.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is (see paragraph 7 of the determination) that he
    has a British citizen son, J, who was born on [ ] 2014, to his  British
    citizen mother, D L M. However, the relationship with the mother  ended
    in April 2014, and the Appellant now has contact with the child from  1
    p.m. to 3 p.m. on Tuesdays.  Second, the Appellant has  entered  a  new
    relationship with a C M, to whom he has  been  Islamically  married  on
    22nd December 2014, having met  her  in  May  2014,  and  she  has  two
    daughters, S and A, who were born in 2006 and 2007 respectively, and it
    would not be feasible for the Appellant's wife to live in  Afghanistan,
    which is unstable, and the children would be disrupted, and she is also
    furthermore of Bengali heritage, and would not be  able  to  speak  the
    language there.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge heard evidence both from the Appellant and  from  C  M.   The
    judge concluded that, although there had been  a  history  of  domestic
    abuse  on  the  part  of  the  Appellant  in  relation  to  his   first
    relationship with D L M, "there is not a shred of evidence of  domestic
    abuse in the current relationship" (paragraph 28).  The  Appellant  has
    been living in the household with C M, and the two stepdaughters.   The
    judge also recounted how the Appellant arrived in the UK  when  he  had
    reached the Afghan school leaving age,  with  no  prospect  of  gainful
    employment, and he had the support of the UK policy  of  educating  him
    until he was 18, following which he submitted his current  application.
    However, "it cannot be said that the Appellant's  life  has  ever  been
    anything other than precarious (Section 117(5))" (paragraph  33).   The
    judge also observed that, despite the length of time that he  had  been
    in this country, his English remained poor,  and  the  judge  concluded
    that, "I have not accepted the depth and quality  of  the  relationship
    with the stepchildren claimed on  the  Appellant's  behalf"  (paragraph
    33).  However, the judge, nevertheless, in the same breath, went on  to
    say that "he does  have  a  (step)  parental  relationship  with  those
    children and they cannot be  expected  to  go  to  his  homeland.   For
    different reasons from those advanced, therefore, it  can  be  accepted
    that the Section 117 presumption falls away" (paragraph 33).  The judge
    went on to conclude (at paragraph 36) that, "having found  there  is  a
    form of (step)  parental  relationship  and  not  having  rejected  the
    marriage as a sham, the Appellant succeeds under EX.1.2(ii) ... ...".

 5. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The Grounds of Appeal stated that the judge erred in finding  that  the
    couple were partners since they could not meet the definition found  in
    GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM.  The judge  also  erred  in  finding  that  the
    Appellant had  a  genuine  parental  relationship  with  his  partner's
    children, in that his findings were contrary to the  findings  that  he
    had earlier made.  Furthermore, at paragraphs 27 to 31, the judge  fell
    into error by making  conflicting  findings  that  a  genuine  parental
    relationship had been established.  The judge also fell into  error  in
    failing to consider whether the Appellant was a "partner" in accordance
    with GEN.1.2.

 7. On 2nd December 2016, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 9th May 2017, Mr Mills, appearing on behalf
    of the Respondent Secretary  of  State,  relied  upon  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal.  First, that the judge had allowed  the  appeal  wrongly  under
    EX.1, finding that there were insurmountable obstacles to  family  life
    if the Appellant's current  partner  returned  with  him  to  his  home
    country  in  Afghanistan.   However,  since  the  Appellant's   current
    partner, C M, was his wife by way of an  Islamic  marriage  only,  with
    whom he commenced cohabitation subsequent  to  the  submission  of  his
    application, the criteria set out  in  GEN.1.2,  for  the  purposes  of
    defining a "partner" were not met.  The partner had to be

      i) the applicant's spouse;

     ii) the applicant's civil partner;

    iii) the applicant's fiancï¿½e or proposed civil partner; or

     iv) a person who has been living  together  with  the  applicant  in  a
         relationship akin to marriage for at least two years prior  to  the
         date of the application.

 9. Accordingly, the judge was  bound  to  find  that  EX.1  could  not  be
    considered in this appeal.  The judge allowed the appeal  at  paragraph
    36 on this basis when he should not have done so.

10. Second, the judge also erred in consideration of Section  117B  of  the
    NIA Act 2002 because at paragraph 33 and 36  of  the  determination  he
    found that the Appellant had a genuine parental relationship  with  the
    children of his partner, but these conclusions  runs  contrary  to  the
    previous findings made about the quality of those relationships,  which
    he found at paragraphs 27 to 31.

11. Third, the reference to "genuine and subsisting parental  relationship"
    as found in Section 117B(6) must mean something more than  cohabitation
    with the child.  This is  clearly  set  out  at  RK  (Section  117B(6);
    "parental relationship")  IJR  [2016]  UKUT  00031,  which  requires  a
    relationship of some depth and quality.  That decision makes  it  clear
    that the role that this individual must play should establish  that  he
    or she has "stepped into the shoes" of a parent.  This was not the case
    here on the very findings of the judge himself at paragraphs 27 to  31.



12. Finally, the judge was wrong to have concluded (at paragraph  33)  that
    "the Section 117B presumption falls away, because  this  suggests  that
    other parts of Section 117B which go against the Appellant  are  to  be
    disregarded".  This could not be right.

13. For his  part,  Mr  Ali  submitted  that,  in  what  was  a  clear  and
    comprehensive determination, this  amounted  to  nothing  more  than  a
    "simple quarrel" with the findings of  the  judge  below.   First,  the
    Respondent at the hearing did not take the "partner" point against  the
    Appellant at the hearing,  and  no  arguments  were  presented  on  it.
    Second, the judge was considering Article 8 within and outside  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  With this in mind, it is clear that the  judge  was
    right in suggesting that, although there had been violence against  the
    former partner "there is not a shred of evidence of domestic  abuse  in
    the  current  relationship"  (paragraph  28).   Thereafter,  the  judge
    considered the evidence in a balanced and fair way (see  paragraphs  29
    to 30).  Second, in so doing, the judge came  to  the  firm  conclusion
    (see paragraphs 33 and 36) that  the  Appellant  "does  have  a  (step)
    parental relationship with those children and they cannot  be  expected
    to go  to  his  homeland".   Third,  if  the  judge  had  set  out  his
    reservations as to the strength and depth of the relationship, this was
    a matter that he was perfectly entitled to do,  and  only  demonstrated
    the care and sensitivity he showed with respect  to  the  facts  before
    him.

Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

15.  First,  and  despite  Mr  Ali's  courageous  efforts  to  persuade  me
    otherwise, the judge's main conclusions are not at paragraph 33  (where
    he states that, "although I have not accepted the depth and quality  of
    the relationship with the stepchildren ..."), but at paragraph  28  and
    31.  At paragraph 28, the judge observes that the Appellant  "is  known
    to the police for domestic abuse" (such that even Miss C  M  "finds  it
    necessary to keep away from the Appellant when he is in a  bad  mood");
    that he declined to engage with therapeutic training for which  he  was
    referred; and that, "neither, in a number of other  respects,  does  he
    emerge in a favourable light from the social work report".

16. Second,  there  is  the  social  worker's  report  that  the  Appellant
    prioritises his own needs  as  opposed  to  those  of  the  child,  and
    although he claims to have a relationship with his son  J,  the  social
    worker observes that, "it brings into question the true nature  of  his
    wish to care for A and S".  The judge himself concludes from this that,
    "those antecedents serve to give rise to the same question  in  respect
    of the Appellant's stepdaughters".  The clear implication here is  that
    the Appellant does not have the requisite relationship, such that he is
    able to step in the shoes of a natural parent, that he is  expected  to
    have.  Indeed, the judge is quite clear that, "my  conclusion  is  that
    the Appellant's role is such that it is not vital to the best interests
    of the girls" (paragraph 31).  So much  so  that  the  judge  concludes
    that, "I do not find the Appellant to be either as  significant  or  as
    beneficial to his stepdaughters as he has claimed" (paragraph 31).

17. Third, insofar as the judge then concludes that  there  is  a  parental
    relationship between him and the stepdaughters,  this  is  based  on  a
    misunderstanding of the Tribunal decision  in  RK  [2016]  UKUT  00031,
    which stated that, "it is not  necessary  for  an  individual  to  have
    'parental  responsibility'  in  law  for  there  to  exist  a  parental
    relationship, but this was subject to the caveat  that  the  individual
    establishes that he or she has 'stepped into the shoes' of  a  parent".
    This was plainly not the case here.  Indeed, at paragraph 33, the judge
    records that, "although I have not accepted the depth  and  quality  of
    the relationship with  the  stepchildren  claimed  on  the  Appellant's
    behalf, he does have a (step) parental relationship with those children
    and they cannot be expected  to  go  to  his  homeland",  which  is  an
    entirely separate matter.  Just because the Appellant is living in  the
    same household, and under the same roof as the  stepchildren  does  not
    suggest that he has stepped into the shoes of a parent.   In  the  same
    way, just because the children cannot be expected to go to  Afghanistan
    with him, does not suggest that his claim is made out.

18.  Fourth,  to  suggest  that  "there  is  a  form  of  'step)   parental
    relationship" (at paragraph 36), does not suffice to  demonstrate  that
    the Appellant has "stepped into the shoes" of a parent.

19. Finally, as far as the position of the Appellant's current  partner,  C
    M, is concerned, the judge was also wrong to have  allowed  the  appeal
    under EX.1.12(ii) because she was  not  his  "partner"  as  defined  in
    GEN.1.2, there having been only an  Islamic  marriage,  and  where  the
    cohabitation between the two of them only began after the  application.



Remaking the Decision

20. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am mindful of the fact that Mr Ali submitted that, were I  to
    make a finding of an error of law, this matter should be remitted  back
    to the First-tier Tribunal, or  at  any  rate  provision  be  made  for
    further evidence to be heard because events had moved on,  not  one  of
    which was the fact that Miss C M's former husband had now remarried  in
    Bangladesh, but I note the provisions of practice statement  7.2  which
    is to the effect that, "the Upper Tribunal is likely on  each  occasion
    to proceed to remake the decision, instead of remitting the case to the
    First-tier Tribunal".   This  is  so,  unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
    satisfied that the nature or extent of  the  judicial  fact-finding  is
    such that it is appropriate to remit the case.  I am not satisfied that
    this is the case.

21. I have particular regard to practice statement 7.3 which makes it clear
    that, "remaking rather than remitting will nevertheless constitute  the
    normal approach to determining appeals where an error of law is  found,
    even if some further fact-finding is necessary".  Whatever may  be  the
    position in relation to Miss C M's former partner having now  remarried
    in Bangladesh, two things remain absolutely clear.

22. First, that she was not a "partner" for the purposes of GEN1.2, so that
    the appeal could not have been allowed under EX1.1. or  under  (2)(ii).
    Second, that the Appellant did not have a parental relationship, in the
    sense that he could not demonstrate  that  he  had  "stepped  into  the
    shoes" of a parent, given the clear findings  of  the  judge  that  his
    "role is such that it is not vital to the best interests of the  girls"
    and that he tended to prioritise his own needs as opposed to  those  of
    his own child.

23. This being so, I am refusing this appeal for the reasons that have been
    set out above.

Notice of Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    dismissed.

25. An anonymity direction is made.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
