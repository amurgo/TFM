                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the respondent and the respondent  as
    the appellant (as they  appeared  respectively  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal).  The appellant was born on  26  June  1984  and  is  a  male
    citizen of Pakistan.  The appellant applied for entry clearance to  the
    United Kingdom  as  a  partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  HC  395.   His
    application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO)  Islamabad
    on 11  September  2014.   The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Hillis) which, in a decision promulgated 27 April  2015
    allowed the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer
    now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2.  The  parties  agree  that  the  appellant  was  unable  to  meet   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules as regards income.  The appellant
    and his wife (the sponsor) were required to have an income  of  �18,600
    per annum.  It appears that the wife now has an  income  in  excess  of
    that sum but was not  able  to  prove  this,  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules, at the date of the application  and  decision.   The
    judge noted at [20] that the wife's new gross annual income of  �18,720
    was referred to in a contract with her employer  dated  5  April  2014.
    Her salary began to be paid on 1 April 2014.  That date was  after  the
    date of the application made by the  appellant.   Notwithstanding  that
    fact, the judge found [21] that the  respondent  had  evidence  in  her
    possession at the date of decision which, "on the face of it" indicated
    the appellant's sponsor met the minimum income requirement of  �18,600.
    The judge found that there had been "a not insignificant delay" in  the
    ECO reaching a decision which had been delayed pending the judgment  of
    the Court of Appeal in MM [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985.   Unaccountably,  the
    judge went on to find that "this delay, in practical terms,  prohibited
    the appellant from making a fresh application in  June  2014  when  his
    sponsor would be able to  submit  the  relevant  six  month  period  of
    documentation to meet the Rules".  As the grounds point out, there  was
    nothing to prevent the applicant withdrawing her  existing  application
    when making a new one based upon the sponsor's new, increased income.

 3. In addition, the judge's reasoning for his decision to allow the appeal
    on Article 8 grounds is not, in my opinion, sound.  At [22]  the  judge
    noted that a further application for entry clearance would "lead  to  a
    further delay and considerable expense".  The judge took the view  that
    the respondent could have indicated that the delay in waiting  for  the
    decision in MM "was an interference  with  the  appellant's  Article  8
    rights and could easily be  rectified  by  some  basic  and  non-costly
    enquiries to check the new employment details were genuine".  Again,  I
    am not entirely certain what the judge means by  this  statement.   The
    judge  appears  to  believe  that  the  ECO  should,  contrary  to  the
    procedures which he or she is obliged to  follow,  have  granted  entry
    clearance to the appellant notwithstanding the fact that he was  unable
    to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The  ECO's  failure
    to follow such a course of action appears to  have  led  the  judge  to
    consider that the  decision  was  disproportionate  in  the  Article  8
    analysis.  Indeed,  the  judge  went  on  [23]  to  find  that  it  was
    disproportionate  to  expect  the  appellant  "to   submit   the   same
    documentation of his sponsor's income which she knows, on the  face  of
    it, meets the Immigration Rules ..."   The  judge  also  makes  passing
    reference to Section 117B of the 2002 Act (as amended) at [24] but does
    not indicate how he has taken that Section into account  and  makes  an
    assertion in the same paragraph that "it cannot be said  ...  that  the
    respondent's decision was made to protect the economic wellbeing of the
    UK economy or the maintenance of immigration control".  If the decision
    was not made for any of those reasons, the judge does not  indicate  on
    what basis he considers the decision was made.

 4. Throughout the decision, the reasoning of the  judge  is  difficult  to
    follow and, at times, confused.  As Designated Judge  Lewis  stated  in
    granting permission to the respondent, the considerations under Article
    8 which I have outlined above

         "... would arguably have  been  irrelevant  or  marginal  at  best.
         Since the appellant was not able to meet the  requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules, the judge did not articulate why  he  considered
         an Article 8 proportionality assessment as appropriate."

    Indeed, the judge has made no effort to show why the  circumstances  in
    this appeal were so exceptional that the appeal should be allowed under
    Article 8.  This is a case in which the judge has  (for  understandable
    reasons) felt sympathy for the appellant and  sponsor  and  has  simply
    used Article 8 to provide them relief where  the  appellant  could  not
    succeed under the Immigration Rules.  That is not,  in  my  opinion,  a
    legitimate use of Article 8.  I agree with the ECO that it was open  to
    the appellant to withdraw his application when it became apparent  that
    he would not succeed under the Immigration Rules but when his wife  had
    increased her income and when that a fresh  application  (supported  by
    the necessary documentation) stood a good  chance  of  exceeding.   The
    appellant chose not to follow that course of  action.   Thereafter,  it
    was not for Judge Hillis to put matters right for the appellant. In the
    circumstances, I set aside Judge Hillis's decision and have remade  the
    decision.  The appeal against the  immigration  decision  is  dismissed
    under the Immigration Rules  and  on  human  rights  (Article  8  ECHR)
    grounds.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 27 April 2015 is  set
aside.  I have remade the decision.  The appeal  of  the  appellant  against
the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer  dated  11  September  2014  is
dismissed under the Immigration Rules and on human rights  grounds  (Article
8 ECHR).

No anonymity direction is made.
