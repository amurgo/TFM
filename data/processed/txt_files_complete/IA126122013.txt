                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe, born on 5 April  2013.   He
         applied on 24 January  2013  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
         (General)  Migrant  under  the  Points  based  System  (PBS).   The
         respondent refused his application on 5 April  2013,  referring  to
         paragraph 245CA and Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  The first
         reason was that the appellant had not last been  granted  leave  in
         any of the categories required by  paragraph  245CA  (f)  (i)-(iv).
         This was not a points-based issue and  was  decisive  on  its  own.
         Secondly, the appellant had supplied only  2  payslips  covering  2
         months' earnings totalling �3000, which fell short of requirements,
         and so would not be entitled to points either for previous earnings
         or for UK experience.

      2. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Rather  than
         alleging error by the respondent in evaluating his application, his
         grounds are an expression of dissatisfaction with the changing  and
         confusing requirements of the Rules.

      3. First-tier Tribunal Judge McGavin heard the appellant's  appeal  on
         11 September 2013.  The appellant attended, without representation.
         Mrs Siddique was the Presenting  Officer.   In  her  determination,
         promulgated on 24 September 2013, the Judge said that although  the
         appellant understandably felt aggrieved, she could find nothing  to
         permit the appeal to be allowed under  the  rules,  on  grounds  of
         "fairness", or on human rights grounds.

      4. The appellant submitted self-prepared  grounds  of  appeal  to  the
         Upper Tribunal.  Some parts of the  grounds  are  critical  of  the
         Judge's conduct of the hearing.   On  29  January  2014  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Gibb granted permission to appeal, because  although
         the assertions about conduct  of  the  hearing  were  made  without
         supporting evidence or a response from the Judge, "... issues of an
         unrepresented appellant being seen  to  have  a  fair  hearing  are
         important in themselves, even if the eventual outcome  is  unlikely
         to be different."

      5. In view of the nature of the grounds, Judge McGavin  was  asked  to
         provide her response to what was  said  to  have  happened  at  the
         hearing before her.  She provided that in  a  note  dated  6  March
         2014.  Her typed record of the proceedings, made on  the  day,  was
         already on file.  The Judge said that she had  probably  asked  the
         appellant not to use documents before him as a prompt; that  during
         any period when she was with the Presenting Officer in his absence,
         there was no discussion of his case; and that his  nationality  had
         no bearing on her decision.

      6. The case came before Judge Macleman at a "for mention"  hearing  on
         22 July 2014.  Unfortunately, the record of proceedings  and  Judge
         McGavin's response to the grounds had not been issued to parties in
         advance.  The UT supplied copies, and gave  parties  some  time  to
         consider them.  The appellant said he might have preferred  the  UT
         to go ahead and resolve his case without fixing a further  hearing.
         That was not possible, because the same Presenting Officer  was  in
         attendance.  The  grounds  bore  on  her  involvement  in  the  FtT
         hearing, so it would not have been appropriate for her to conduct a
         full hearing in the UT.

      7. The appellant said he was satisfied with the answers to some of his
         points, but not to others.  I  suggested  that  he  might  wish  to
         explain his position further in writing before the next hearing.  I
         also explained to him that allegations of bias against a Judge  are
         treated very seriously, and that in all respects it was for him  to
         establish his grounds of appeal.  He said that he had a sponsor  to
         enable him to make another application, but he knew that  in  order
         for that to be considered he would have to withdraw this appeal.  I
         told him that was a matter entirely for him, on which the UT  could
         not offer any advice.

      8. The case was next listed to come before UTJ's Macleman  and  Dawson
         on 10 September 2014.

      9. The appellant submitted a document dated 2  September  2014,  which
         mainly repeats his original grounds of appeal.  He says that he  is
         asking for the chance to complete his professional qualification in
         architecture.  He also says that he has made  another  application,
         but the respondent  rejected  it  because  he  has  an  outstanding
         appeal.

     10. Mr Kumire relied upon his statements and grounds.

     11. Mrs O'Brien submitted that there was nothing  to  substantiate  the
         allegations of  bias  or  of  procedural  unfairness.   As  to  the
         Immigration Rules, the application was always doomed to  fail,  for
         the various reasons mentioned above.   There  was  no  dispensation
         under article 8 of the ECHR for applicants who failed  under  their
         chosen routes of study or work through the Rules.

     12. Mr Kumire said that when he applied, it was on the  basis  that  he
         could switch into another category.  If there were no  transitional
         provisions to allow him to switch, the refusal decision should  not
         have dealt with points scoring.   The  record  confirmed  that  the
         Presenting  Officer  said  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
         application should have been rejected  as  invalid.   However,  the
         Home office had gone ahead to deal with it, so it should have  been
         accepted that it was a valid application.  The judge had overlooked
         that point.  He never claimed to be at any  risk  in  Zimbabwe,  so
         that should not have been mentioned.  The  determination  was  also
         wrong (�12) in saying that he received advice from the  respondent.
         He had consulted solicitors in Aberdeen after the refusal decision,
         but never obtained advice from the Home Office.

     13. We explained to Mr Kumire that Patel, to which Mrs O'Brien had made
         brief reference, is an authority of the Supreme Court to the effect
         that article 8 of the ECHR confers no general dispensing  power  to
         enable students to complete their courses or qualifications.

     14. Neither party had anything further to add.

     15. We advised Mr Kumire that his appeal would be  dismissed.   Nothing
         he said amounted to a tenable argument that the First-tier Tribunal
         Judge made  any  material  error,  or  that  under  the  Rules  his
         application could possibly have succeeded.   While  he  might  feel
         aggrieved that a particular route under the Rules had  been  closed
         off, the Tribunal had  no  power  to  re-write  the  Rules  out  of
         sympathy so as to provide him with another outcome.  There  was  no
         substance in his submissions  that  anything  untoward  might  have
         taken  place  between  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   and   the
         Presenting Officer.  The proceedings and the determination did  not
         show any bias or unfairness.

     16. We mentioned to the appellant that while we could not give him  any
         formal advice, and any further application would be decided by  the
         respondent on its own merits, he should be careful, if he did  make
         any further application, to do so as soon as possible, and no  less
         than 28 days from the expiry of his leave as currently extended  by
         these  proceedings  (which  Mrs  O'Brien  confirmed   to   be   the
         appropriate period.)

     17. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
         involve the making of an error on  a  point  of  law,  such  as  to
         require it to be set aside, so that determination shall stand.
