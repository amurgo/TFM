                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on the 3rd October 1989.
        On the 21st February 2017 his appeal under the Immigration (European
       Economic Area) Regulations  2006  was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal on the grounds that pursuant to the decision in Sala  (EFMs:
       right of appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC) there was no jurisdiction.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor  on
       the 18th December 2017.  Judge  O'Connor  indicated  that  the  Upper
       Tribunal was minded, following the decision in Khan  v  Secretary  of
       State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 to find  an  error
       of law and remit the matter for hearing de novo before the First-tier
       Tribunal. Judge O'Connor  directed  that  this  would  be  the  final
       disposal of the matter in the Upper Tribunal unless submissions  were
       received to the contrary within 7 working days of his decision  being
       sent.

    3. No such representations having been  received  I  therefore  set  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside and remit  the  matter  for
       hearing de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.

                                                                       [pic]
