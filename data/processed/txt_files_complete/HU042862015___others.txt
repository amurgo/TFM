                                  Anonymity


I make an order under r.14(1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any  matter  likely
to lead members of the public to identify the minor appellants. I  take  the
view that disclosure of the adult appellants'  names  risks  disclosing  the
identities of the minor appellants. I therefore  issue  an  anonymity  order
which  extends  to  the  adult  appellants  (i.e.  the  first   and   second
appellants).  No report of these proceedings shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify them or any of the minor appellants.   This  direction  applies  to
both the appellants and to the  respondent.  Failure  to  comply  with  this
direction could lead to  contempt  of  court  proceedings.  The  parties  at
liberty to apply to discharge this order, with reasons.

Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms S Iqbal, of Counsel, instructed by Arona St James
Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction:


 1. The appellants are nationals of Algeria. The first appellant,  born  on
    15 May 1970, is the husband of the second appellant, born on 23  August
    1971. The third  and  fifth  appellants  are  their  sons.  The  fourth
    appellant is their daughter. All three children were born in the United
    Kingdom, the third appellant on 2 February 2009, the  fourth  appellant
    on 26 May 2011 and the fifth appellant on 25 September 2013.

 2. The appellants have been granted permission to appeal the  decision  of
    Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Malone  who,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 18 January  2017,  dismissed  their  appeals  under  the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds against a decision of the
    respondent of 31 July 2015 to refuse  their  representations  on  human
    rights grounds of 14 May 2012 supplemented  by  a  questionnaire  which
    they completed and which the respondent received on 3 April 2014 and  a
    "Statement of Additional Grounds" dated 16 April 2014.

 3. The respondent  refused  these  representations  on  1  May  2014.  The
    appellants appealed  the  refusal.  Their  appeals  were  heard  before
    Immigration Judge Wilsher who, in a  determination  promulgated  on  16
    February 2015, allowed the appeals  to  the  extent  of  remitting  the
    matter to the respondent for her further proper consideration. This led
    to the decision of 31 July 2015 which was  the  decision  that  is  the
    subject of the instant appeals.

 4. It follows that the decision of 31 July 2015  was  a  decision  on  the
    representations of  14  May  2012  supplemented  by  the  questionnaire
    received by the respondent on  3  April  2014  and  the  "Statement  of
    Additional Grounds" dated 16 April 2014. As at  each  of  these  dates,
    none of the children had lived in the UK continuously for a  period  of
    at least 7 years.

 5. By the date of the hearing before Judge Malone, the third appellant was
    nearly 7 years 11 months old and had lived in the UK continuously since
    birth.

 6. I shall hereafter refer to Judge Malone as the judge,  unless  I  state
    otherwise.

 7. Although it will be necessary  to  consider  the  judge's  decision  in
    greater detail later on in this decision, it suffices to  say  for  the
    present that the judge had evidence that the  fifth  appellant  suffers
    from Bilaterial Congenital  Talipes  Equivarus,  also  known  as  'club
    foot'. The judge had evidence from a Dr Manoj Ramachandran,  the  fifth
    appellant's consultant, including a letter dated 27 May 2015  in  which
    Dr Ramachandran said that the fifth appellant's prognosis was excellent
    if he continued to receive treatment but that  "If  the  treatment  was
    unavailable to him, the condition will recur in virtually all cases and
    would need further casting and probable surgery, so it is  better  that
    he remains here and is treated in the UK". The judge  also  had  before
    him a note dated 4 May 2016 from Dr Ramachandran  to  the  effect  that
    there was "no equivalent non-operative treatment available in  Algeria"
    for the fifth appellant.

The issues

 8. The issues in this appeal may be summarised as follows:

      i)    (Ground 1) Whether the judge erred in law by failing to  decide
        whether the third appellant  satisfied  the  requirements  of  para
        276ADE(1)(iv) of the Immigration Rules.

      ii)   (Ground 2) Whether the judge erred in law in  his  consideration
        of the best interests of the children. The grounds contend that the
        judge erred in the following ways:

            a)   The judge erred by failing to consider whether  there  were
             "considerations of substantial moment" for the  minor  children
             not to be granted leave to remain on the basis of their  rights
             to private lives.

            b)   The judge erred in  taking  into  account  the  immigration
             histories of the first and second appellants  when  considering
             the Article 8 claims of the three children.

      iii)  (Ground 3) Whether the judge erred in law in  his  consideration
        of the medical evidence in relation to  the  fifth  appellant.  The
        grounds contend that the judge erred in the following ways:

            a)   At para 33 of his decision, the  judge  said  that  he  was
             unable  to  attach  "any  real  weight"  to  the  view  of   Dr
             Ramachandran in the note dated 4 May 2016 that  there  was  "no
             equivalent non-operative treatment available  in  Algeria"  for
             the fifth appellant in Algeria because he had  no  evidence  to
             indicate how Dr Ramachandran  was  competent  to  make  such  a
             statement and on what evidence he had based his opinion.

                 The grounds contend that the  judge  erred  in  failing  to
             order  the  respondent  to  disclose   a   document   that   Dr
             Ramachandran had completed in response to a Home Office  letter
             dated 27 April 2017 which the respondent had  not  provided  to
             the judge. The judge therefore failed to consider whether  this
             document would have  contained  evidence  to  indicate  how  Dr
             Ramachandran was competent to make such a statement and on what
             evidence he had based his opinion.

            b)   The judge erred in failing to give sufficient  reasons  for
             preferring the evidence of the NHS Choices  website  concerning
             the treatment available in Algeria for the fifth appellant over
             the evidence Dr Ramachandran.

Assessment

 9. The judge's decision was a very detailed and careful assessment of  the
    Article 8 claims of  the  appellants.  I  shall  only  quote  from  his
    decision to the extent necessary in order to deal with the grounds.  As
    the grounds  do  not  challenge  significant  aspects  of  the  judge's
    reasoning and findings, my approach means that the reader will not  get
    a full and proper understanding of the judge's reasoning  and  approach
    from reading my decision in isolation. I stress that it is necessary to
    read the judge's decision in full  in  order  to  appreciate  that  his
    assessment of the Article 8 claims  was  not  only  very  detailed  and
    careful but well-rounded and unassailable. In my judgement,  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal should never have been granted. I  make
    it clear that I reached this conclusion only after I had considered the
    grounds and submissions for the appellants.

10. I turn to deal with the grounds and submissions.

11. Ground 1 is the single ground upon which permission to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal was granted  by  a  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    granted permission.

12. Ground 1 is hopeless, for reasons which I will now give.

13. A child who is under the age of 18 years  and  who  has  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom continuously for  a  period  of  at  least  7  years  is
    eligible for consideration under para 276ADE(1)(iv) of the  Immigration
    Rules and s.117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    (the "2002 Act") taken together  with  the  definition  of  "qualifying
    child" in s.117D of the 2002 Act. These provide as follows:


             Para 276ADE(1)(iv) of the Immigration Rules:


             "276ADE (1). The requirements to be met  by  an  applicant  for
             leave to remain on the grounds of private life in  the  UK  are
             that at the date of application, the applicant:


                       ...


             (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in
                 the UK for at least 7  years  (discounting  any  period  of
                 imprisonment) and it would not be reasonable to expect  the
                 applicant to leave the UK; or"

            (my emphasis")


            Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act:


            "(6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
                 the public interest does not require the  person's  removal
                 where-


                  (a)  the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                       relationship with a qualifying child, and
                  (b)  it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
     leave the United Kingdom.


            Section 117D of the 2002 Act:


            "117D Interpretation of this Part


            (1)   In this Part-


            ...


            "qualifying child" means a person who is under the age of 18 and
     who-


            (a)   is a British citizen, or
            (b)   has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of
     seven years or more; ..."

14. It is therefore plain that para 276ADE(1)(iv) specifically requires the
    qualifying period  of  7  years'  continuous  residence  to  have  been
    accumulated as at the date of application  whereas  there  is  no  such
    limitation in the case of s.117B(6) of the 2002 Act.  In  the  case  of
    s.117B(6), the qualifying period of 7 years' continuous  residence  can
    be accumulated at the date of the hearing before a judge.

15. As I have said at para 4 above, the decision of 31  July  2015  in  the
    instant case was a decision on  the  representations  of  14  May  2012
    supplemented by the questionnaire received by the respondent on 3 April
    2014 and the "Statement of Additional Grounds" dated 16 April 2014.

16. Accordingly, whether the date of application was 14 May 2012 or 3 April
    2014 or 16 April 2014, none  of  the  children  had  lived  in  the  UK
    continuously for a period of at  least  7  years  as  at  the  date  of
    application. It  follows  that  the  third  appellant  was  simply  not
    eligible for consideration under para 276ADE(1)(iv) of the  Immigration
    Rules.

17. Accordingly, the judge did not err in law when he said, at para  17  of
    his decision, that none of  the  appellants  could  succeed  under  the
    Article 8 provisions contained in the Immigration Rules.

18. For the reasons given above,  ground  1  as  advanced  in  the  written
    grounds is misconceived.

19. Since the third appellant had lived in the United Kingdom  continuously
    for a period of nearly 7 years 11 months as at the date of the hearing,
    the judge correctly considered his case under  s.117B(6)  of  the  2002
    Act. He found, at para 67, that it would be reasonable  to  expect  the
    third appellant to leave the United Kingdom, making it clear  that,  in
    reaching this finding, he had taken into  account  the  fact  that  the
    first and second appellants  had  never  been  in  the  United  Kingdom
    lawfully (para 67) and that  he  had  taken  into  account  the  public
    interest factors (para 65).

20. At the hearing, Ms Iqbal sought to expand the  scope  of  ground  1  as
    follows. She drew my attention to the provisions of GEN.1.9(a)(iii)  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. This provides:

            "GEN.1.9 In this Appendix:

            (a)  the requirement to  make  a  valid  application  will   not
                 apply when the Article 8 claim is raised:

                 (i)   ...;

                 (ii)  ...;

                 (iii)       in an appeal (subject to  the  consent  of  the
                       Secretary of State where applicable); ..."

21. In reliance upon GEN.1.9(a)(iii), Ms Iqbal  submitted  that  the  judge
    should have considered the position of the third  appellant  under  the
    Immigration Rules and not merely outside the Rules under  s.117B(6)  of
    the 2002 Act.

22. However, GEN.1.9(a)(iii) simply does not assist the appellants for  the
    following reasons:

23. Firstly, it is evident from the wording of  GEN.1.9(a)(iii)  that  some
    sort of application, even if not a valid one, needs to be made for this
    provision to apply, whereas there was nothing before me  to  show  that
    the  appellants  had  made  any  application  at  all  other  than  the
    "application" (i.e. the representations of 14 May 2012 supplemented  as
    stated at my para 4 above) that was the subject of the decision  of  31
    July 2015. However, even if this is wrong,  the  Secretary  of  State's
    consent is needed where applicable. Ms Iqbal did  not  explain  whether
    this was one of those cases in which the Secretary of  State's  consent
    was required.

24. Secondly, and in any event, this point was plainly  not  argued  before
    the judge. Accordingly, I cannot see how the judge can be said to  have
    erred in law by failing to deal with an issue not  relied  upon  before
    him.

25. I turn to ground 2.

26. I shall deal first with ground 2(b),  i.e.  that  the  judge  erred  in
    taking into account the immigration histories of the first  and  second
    appellants when considering the Article 8 claims of the three children.



27. Ground 2(b) is plainly misconceived, as it ignores the judgment of  the
    Court of Appeal in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 from which  it  is
    clear that the immigration histories of a child's parents do fall to be
    taken into account in deciding whether it is reasonable for  the  child
    to leave the United Kingdom. Ms Iqbal accepted  that  ground  2(b)  was
    simply wrong.

28. I turn to ground 2(a), i.e. that the judge erred by failing to consider
    whether there were "considerations of substantial moment" for the minor
    appellants not to be granted leave to remain  on  the  basis  of  their
    rights to private lives.

29. The phrase "considerations of substantial  moment"  emanates  from  the
    judgment of Lord Kerr in ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4 at para 46,
    which reads:

      "It is a universal theme of the  various  international  and  domestic
             instruments to which Lady Hale has referred that,  in  reaching
             decisions that will affect a child,  a  primacy  of  importance
             must be accorded to his or her best interests. This is not,  it
             is agreed, a factor of limitless importance in the  sense  that
             it will prevail over all other considerations. It is a  factor,
             however, that must rank higher than any other. It is not merely
             one consideration that weighs in the  balance  alongside  other
             competing factors.  Where  the  best  interests  of  the  child
             clearly favour a certain course, that course should be followed
             unless countervailing reasons of  considerable  force  displace
             them. It is not  necessary  to  express  this  in  terms  of  a
             presumption but the primacy of this consideration needs  to  be
             made clear in emphatic terms. What is determined  to  be  in  a
             child's best interests should customarily dictate  the  outcome
             of cases such as the present, therefore, and  it  will  require
             considerations of substantial  moment  to  permit  a  different
             result."

            (my underlining)

30. The written grounds contend that, given that the  judge  had  found  at
    para 61 of his decision that "the best interests of the children points
    to their remaining in the United Kingdom", the judge erred in  applying
    the test of reasonableness and that he should instead  have  considered
    the different test of whether there were "considerations of substantial
    moment".

31. This ground is simply misconceived. Ms Iqbal accepted  that  Lord  Kerr
    did not intend to  set  out  a  different  test  in  using  the  phrase
    "considerations of substantial moment". Thus, insofar  as  the  grounds
    contend that  the  judge  applied  the  wrong  test,  they  are  simply
    misconceived.

32. Ms Iqbal advanced this aspect of the written grounds  as  follows.  She
    submitted that the judge failed to consider properly the best interests
    of the children and the issue of  whether  it  is  reasonable  for  the
    children to leave the United Kingdom.  When I asked her what errors  of
    law were in the judge's decision, she submitted that the judge erred as
    follows:

    i)      He placed undue weight on  the  immigration  histories  of  the
       first and second appellants.

    ii)     He simply  concluded  that  it  would  be  reasonable  for  the
       children to leave the United Kingdom and did  not  consider  whether
       there were strong reasons for  the  children  to  leave  the  United
       Kingdom.

33. Dealing first with Ms Iqbal's submission  that  the  judge  had  placed
    undue weight on the immigration  histories  of  the  first  and  second
    appellants, I consider that no authority is needed for the  proposition
    that weight was a matter for the judge, it not  having  been  suggested
    that the judge's decision was simply irrational or perverse.  There  is
    therefore nothing in the submission that the judge placed undue  weight
    on the immigration histories of the first and second appellants.

34. The submission that the judge had simply concluded  that  it  would  be
    reasonable for the children to leave the United  Kingdom  and  did  not
    consider whether there were strong reasons for the  children  to  leave
    the United Kingdom simply ignores  the  judge's  careful  and  detailed
    reasoning. His findings that it would be reasonable  for  each  of  the
    three children to leave the  United  Kingdom  were  made  not  only  by
    considering the individual circumstances of each child,  having  placed
    significant weight (in relation to the third  appellant)  on  the  fact
    that he had lived in the United Kingdom for a period  in  excess  of  7
    years, but also by considering the circumstances of this family and the
    extent of their private lives in the United Kingdom as  well  as  their
    circumstances  in Algeria if they were to leave the United Kingdom.

35. I said at my para 19 above, that the judge found, at  para  67  of  his
    decision, that it would be reasonable to expect the third appellant  to
    leave the United Kingdom,  making  it  clear  that,  in  reaching  this
    finding, he had taken into account the fact that the first  and  second
    appellants had never been in the United Kingdom lawfully (para 67)  and
    that he had taken into account the public interest factors  (para  65).
    Indeed, his reasons for concluding that it would be reasonable for  the
    third appellant to leave the United Kingdom begin at  para  18  of  his
    decision and cover a range of matters, as follows:

    i)      (Paras 18-21) the immigration  histories  of  the  parents.  He
        rejected their evidence of the dates of their  claimed  entry  into
        the United Kingdom.

    ii)     (Paras 22-23) He  found  that  the  first  appellant  has  been
        working illegally in the United Kingdom.

    iii)    (Paras 24-26, 28 and 41) He considered the evidence in relation
        to the second appellant's medical complaint (she  suffered  from  a
        congenital abnormality in her right ear) and the third  appellant's
        medical complaint (he suffers from  visual  impairment)  and  noted
        that the medical evidence was over five years old (in the  case  of
        the second appellant) and over three years old (in the case of  the
        third appellant) and that there was  no  evidence  that  they  were
        receiving ongoing treatment.

    iv)     (Para 27) He took into account the  school  reports  and  other
        documents before him all of which  he  said  showed  that  all  the
        children were doing well in the United Kingdom.

    v)      (Para 29) He noted that the fourth  appellant  did  not  suffer
        from health problems.

    vi)     (Paras 30-40 and 52) He  considered  the  medical  evidence  in
        relation  to  the  fifth  appellant  in  considerable  detail   and
        concluded that there would be treatment available to him in Algiers
        that was comparable to that available in  the  United  Kingdom  and
        that is free.

      vii)  (Paras 42-43) He considered the evidence as to how this  family
        had maintained and accommodated themselves in the United Kingdom.

    viii)   (Paras 44-45) He considered the evidence as  to  the  languages
        spoken within this family and found that it  was  likely  that  the
        third appellant speaks Arabic and French in addition to English and
        that it was likely that the fourth appellant did as well.

    ix)     He considered  the  family  ties  that  the  first  and  second
        appellants had in Algeria, their evidence that there  would  be  no
        home for them and the children in Algeria and no work for the first
        appellant. He found it likely that the financial support that  they
        were receiving from friends in the United  Kingdom  would  continue
        and likely that the siblings of the  first  and  second  appellants
        would rally around to help them (paras 46-49). He  therefore  found
        that the family would find accommodation and  the  first  appellant
        would find employment (para 57).

      x)    (Para 50) He noted that there was no evidence to show that  the
        children would not be able to access education in Algiers.

      xi)   He made it clear that he considered the best interests  of  the
        children as  a  paramount  consideration  (para  54),  taking  into
        account that they will reside with their parents and continue to be
        brought up in a loving atmosphere whatever decision is made in this
        appeal, that it was likely  that  the  children  speak  Arabic  and
        French, that it was probable that they have been  brought  up  with
        regard the Algerian and Islamic culture and, if removed to Algeria,
        they would be going to live in the  country  of  their  nationality
        (para 55); that the children were performing well at  school,  that
        only the fifth  appellant  had  a  condition  that  needed  regular
        monitoring but adequate treatment was available  in  Algiers  (para
        56); and that the family would find  accommodation  and  the  first
        appellant would find employment (para 57).

    xii)    At para 58, he said that he attached significant weight to  the
        fact that the third appellant had never lived anywhere  there  than
        the United Kingdom and had now  lived  here  for  more  than  seven
        years. He also said that he bore in mind that the  third  appellant
        was not yet 8 years old and that his private life to date will have
        been almost exclusively centred on his  parents  and  siblings.  He
        considered that the same reasoning  applied,  a  fortiori,  to  the
        fourth and fifth appellants.

    xiii)   He then said, at para 61, that he found that  "a  consideration
        of the children's best interests points to their remaining  in  the
        United Kingdom, but only just" (my underlining).

      xiv)  At para 62, the judge quoted para 46 of  the  judgment  of  the
        Court of Appeal in MA (Pakistan), where Elias LJ said, inter  alia,
        that, once the seven years'  residence  requirement  is  satisfied,
        there need to be "strong reasons" for refusing leave.

    xv)      At  paras  68-70,  the  judge  considered  the  delay  on  the
        respondent's part in refusing the application, this being the delay
        from 14 May 2012 to  1  May  2014,  but  he  also  noted  that  the
        appellants were refused leave on 26  May  2011  with  no  right  of
        appeal, that the parents have knowingly lived in the United Kingdom
        under the shadow of  removal,  that  the  second  appellant  speaks
        English and the first appellant does not and  that  the  first  and
        second appellants have never been financially independent.

    xvi)     The  judge  then  concluded  (para  71)  that  it   would   be
        proportionate to remove all of the appellants, that the maintenance
        of effective immigration control requires this to be done and there
        were no compelling circumstances as to why any  of  the  appellants
        should be granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom outside the
        Immigration Rules.

36. I accept that the judge did  not  state,  in  terms,  what  the  strong
    reasons were  for  concluding  that  the  decision  was  proportionate.
    However, it is plain that he did consider  whether  there  were  strong
    reasons, having quoted specifically  from  the  very  paragraph  in  MA
    (Pakistan) where the Court of Appeal specifically stated  the  need  to
    find strong reasons. It is clear, when the judge's decision is read  as
    a whole, that he did find there were strong reasons, beginning with the
    immigration histories of the parents,  that  the  first  appellant  had
    worked illegally in the United Kingdom, the evidence that  this  family
    was not financially independent and that the first appellant  does  not
    speak English. In relation to financial independence,  he  plainly  had
    evidence before him that the  fifth  appellant  was  receiving  medical
    treatment in the United Kingdom. There was no evidence before the judge
    that such treatment was being funded privately.

37. I therefore reject  Ms  Iqbal's  submission  that  the  judge  did  not
    consider whether there were strong reasons for the children,  including
    the third appellant, to leave  the  United  Kingdom.  He  did  consider
    whether there were strong  reasons  having  given  such  weight  as  he
    considered appropriate to the evidence  before  him  of  their  private
    lives and, in the case of the third appellant,  significant  weight  on
    the length of his residence in the United Kingdom.

38. At the  hearing,  Ms  Iqbal  referred  me  to  specific  pages  in  the
    appellants' bundle before the judge. There was a letter from the  third
    appellant at page 75; a letter  from  his  head  teacher  at  page  34,
    evidence of his certificates and  integration  at  pages  69-71  and  a
    school report at pages 76-78.  However, there is  no  reason  to  think
    that the judge did not take all of this evidence into account, as  well
    as the evidence concerning the fourth and fifth appellants.  The  judge
    said at para 27:

            "27. [The third appellant] is now just shy of 8 years old.  [The
              fourth appellant] is about 5  �.  [The  fifth  appellant]  is
              approximately 3 � . All the children were born in the  United
              Kingdom and none has left the United Kingdom. The  elder  two
              attend Thorpe Hall Primary School,  Walthamstow.  [The  fifth
              appellant] has started at  Thorpe  Hall  Nursery,  where  the
              other went as well. I had numerous school reports  and  other
              documents relating to their respective educational histories.
              It is clear they are all doing well."

            (My emphasis)

39. Judges are not obliged to refer in specific terms to every piece of the
    evidence before them. In the instant case, and given that it  is  clear
    from para 27 of his decision that he was aware of the existence of  the
    very documents that Ms Iqbal referred me to, I am  satisfied  that  the
    judge did take into account all of the material relied upon before  him
    in relation to the minor appellants.

40. There is therefore no substance in ground 2. I turn to ground 3.

41. There are two aspects to ground 3. The first contends  that  the  judge
    erred by failing to order the respondent to disclose a  document  which
    Dr Ramachandran had completed and  submitted  to  the  respondent.  The
    document in question is a document  completed  by  Dr  Ramachandran  in
    response to a Home Office letter  dated  27  April  2017.  The  grounds
    contend that the  judge  therefore  failed  to  consider  whether  this
    document would have contained evidence to indicate how Dr  Ramachandran
    was competent to make such a statement and  on  what  evidence  he  had
    based his opinion in the note dated 4  May  2016  that  there  was  "no
    equivalent non-operative treatment available in Algeria" for the  fifth
    appellant in Algeria.

42. I put to Ms Iqbal at the hearing that it was open  to  the  appellants'
    representative to have submitted the document in question to the judge.
    She did not disagree. In any event, it is simply speculation to suggest
    that the document contains some information of relevance to  the  issue
    whether Dr Ramachandran was competent to give the opinion he gave, that
    there was no equivalent non-operative treatment  available  in  Algeria
    for the fifth appellant in Algeria. It was open to  the  appellants  to
    have submitted the document for the hearing before me and no doubt that
    they would have been advised to do so if  the  document  contained  any
    relevant evidence. This was not done.

43. I therefore reject ground 3(a).

44. I turn to ground 3(b), which is that the judge erred in failing to give
    sufficient reasons for preferring  the  evidence  of  the  NHS  Choices
    website concerning the treatment available in  Algeria  for  the  fifth
    appellant over the evidence of Dr Ramachandran.

45.  The  judge  considered  the  medical  evidence  concerning  the  fifth
    appellant at pars 30-40 of his decision, which read:


        "30.     [The fifth appellant]  has  Bilateral  Congenital  Talipes
              Equivarus, right foot atypical. He has had six Ponseti  casts
              to date. He has bene treated with boots and bars to  be  worn
              23 hours out of 24 hours a day for three months. That was the
              situation as  at  2  January  2014.  He  had  had  tenometies
              performed in 2003. I had a letter from Dr. Manoj Ramachandran
              to the Home Office dated 27 May  2015.  Dr.  Ramachandran  is
              [the fifth appellant's] consultant.


        31.      The letter is short and  states  that  "the  prognosis  is
              excellent with minimal risk of recurrence of  he  [the  fifth
              appellant] continues to  receive  treatment  in  the  UK.  If
              treatment was unavailable to him the condition will recur  in
              virtually all cases and he would  need  further  casting  and
              probable surgery, so it is better that he remains here and is
              treated in the UK".


        32.      The letter  also  recorded:  "I  completed  your  enclosed
              document", referring to the Home Office's letter of 27  April
              2015. The completed document was not provided to  me  by  the
              Respondent. Mr. Singer submitted that that was unfortunate. I
              see no great significance in that omission,  particularly  as
              there is the further comment raised by Mr. Ramachandran in  a
              note dated 4 May 2016. That was to the effect that there  was
              "no equivalent non-operative treatment available in Algeria".


        33.      I  had  no  evidence  to  indicate  how  it  is  that  Mr.
              Ramachandran is competent to make such  a  statement  and  on
              what evidence he based his opinion. I am unable to attach any
              real weight to his observation.


        34.      [The second appellant] accepted,  in  her  oral  evidence,
              that there is a hospital in Algiers, the city from which  her
              and her husband's family comes. She told me that it does  not
              have the same "club foot" treatment as that  available  here.
              She told me she had been told this by a friend's family.  She
              told me that treatment  is  not  free  for  all  children  in
              Algeria. She told me "We know the situation".


        35.      I had background information  relating  to  the  treatment
              available to [the fifth  appellant]  in  Algiers.  I  had  an
              answer to a COI request. The answer was dated 21  July  2015.
              The request was  for  information  as  to  the  treatment  of
              Congenital Talipes Equivarus in Algeria.


        36.      The reply stated that "Outpatient  medical  treatment  and
              follow up by a paediatrician is available at Centre Hospitalo
              - Universitaire Mustapha Bacha in Algeria. Follow  up  by  an
              orthopaedist/orthopaedic  surgeon  was  also  available.  The
              services were provided through a "Public  Facility".  Medical
              devices, including ankle-foot orthosis, orthopaedic shoes and
              lower and upper limb arthoses were available at an identified
              Public Facility in Algiers.


        37.      An extract from "Our Africa" website stated "Free  medical
              care was introduced in Algeria in  the  1970s".  The  extract
              stated that this was  now  available  for  children  and  the
              elderly and those on low incomes. The extract  was  dated  23
              July 2015.


        38.      I also had a "NHS Choices" extract entitled  "Club  Foot".
              The following appeared under the heading "Outlook":


                       "The vast majority  of  children  treated  with  the
                   Ponseti method will have pain-free,  normal-looking  feet
                   that function well. Most children are able  to  learn  to
                   walk by the usual age and can participate  in  activities
                   such as sports when they're older.


                       Some children may be left with  a  slightly  shorter
                   leg and smaller foot on one side if  only  one  of  their
                   feet  is  affected.  This   won't   usually   cause   any
                   significant problems, but it may  mean  that  your  child
                   will be less mobile and may get tired quicker than  other
                   children."


        39.      The US Department of State report of 8 April  2010  stated
              that the Algerian government provided free medical  care  for
              all citizens - including children with disabilities -  albeit
              in generally rudimentary facilities.


        40.       I  therefore  conclude  that  there  would  be  treatment
              available to [the  fifth  appellant]  in  Algiers,  treatment
              comparable to that available in this country, that is free."

46. There was no attempt to engage with the judge's  reasoning  to  explain
    precisely why  it  is  said  that  he  gave  insufficient  reasons  for
    preferring the evidence of  the  NHS  Choices  website  concerning  the
    treatment available  in  Algeria  for  the  fifth  appellant  over  the
    evidence of Dr Ramachandran, nor did Ms Iqbal engage with  the  judge's
    reasoning at paras 30-40 of his decision.

47. Instead, Ms Iqbal referred me to the fact that Dr  Ramachandran  was  a
    specialist in his field, that he has been treating the fifth  appellant
    since birth, that the fifth appellant has six-monthly reviews  with  Dr
    Ramachandran, that Dr Ramachandran had specifically said that there was
    no equivalent  non-operative  treatment  for  the  fifth  appellant  in
    Algeria and that the second appellant had also said that there  was  no
    such treatment in Algeria, as recorded by the judge at para 34  of  his
    decision.

48. I have to say that Ms Iqbal's submissions  before  me  on  this  issue,
    which I have set out in full in the preceding paragraph, amount  to  no
    more than a disagreement with  the  judge's  reasoning.  They  did  not
    disclose any error of law on the part of the judge.

49. For all of the reasons given above, I am satisfied that the  judge  did
    not err  in  law.  The  written  grounds  were  simply  unarguable  and
    permission should not have been granted.

      Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.

Upper Tribunal Judge Gill
