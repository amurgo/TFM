                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge S J
    Clarke promulgated on 1st May 2014,  following  at  hearing  at  Hatton
    Cross on 11th April 2014.  In the determination,  the  judge  dismissed
    the appeal of Ms Yuxia Wang, who  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of China who was born on 27th February 1971.
     She appealed against the decision of the Respondent Secretary of State
    to refuse her a derivative residence card on 9th January  2013  on  the
    basis that she was a third country national, who stood to benefit  from
    the ECA judgment in Ruiz Zambrano (C-34/09), because she is the primary
    carer of her British citizen child, Zihao Xu.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that she is the mother of Zihao Xu, who  is  a
    British citizen child, and with whom she lives and whom she cares  for.
    Her husband, the father of Zihao Xu, did not want  the  child,  and  he
    wanted  the  Appellant  to  have  an  abortion,   which   ended   their
    relationship prior to the birth of the child.  He, Feng Xu, is  also  a
    British citizen having been naturalised in this country.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge had regard to a letter  written  by  the  Appellant  on  14th
    November 2012 that her  father  did  not  want  the  child,  had  never
    supported  her  or  the  child  financially  or  emotionally,  but  the
    Respondent Secretary of State did  not  accept  the  contents  of  this
    letter, and refused to grant the Appellant a derivative residence  card
    on 9th January 2013.

 5. At the hearing before the judge, there was evidence that the  Appellant
    had come to the UK for studies, which her  parents  had  financed  with
    some difficulty, and she supported herself with rental income from some
    of the properties that she owned in China, and also had  some  savings.
    The judge heard evidence that the Appellant  had  to  beg  the  child's
    father to attend the registration of the birth, which  he  did  attend,
    but he was not married and is not working at present.

 6. The last time they spoke was  in  2014  when  she  told  him  that  her
    application had been refused.  The only person who has looked after the
    Appellant and the child is the  child's  father's  stepfather  and  the
    Appellant telephones him when she is trying to phone the baby's  father
    or when she attempts to go to the home of the child's father.  He, Feng
    Xu, the child's father, has seen the child  only  four  or  five  times
    (paragraph 16).  He was ten  years  younger  than  the  Appellant  "and
    sometimes he behaves like a child" (paragraph 19).

 7. The judge's findings were that "In the absence of supporting  witnesses
    and cogent documentary evidence, especially  from  independent  sources
    such as the GP's surgery and the new  nurseries,  the  child  would  be
    attending", there were "inconsistencies in the account given to  me  by
    the Appellant, which was such that she was left with no option  but  to
    conclude that the burden of proof upon  her  had  not  been  discharged
    (paragraph 35).



Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that there was no cross-examination of
    the Appellant as to whether she was the mother or the primary carer  of
    the child.  This was essential given  the  decision  in  Zambrano  from
    which the Appellant stood to benefit had she been the primary carer.

 9. On 6th June  2014,  permission  to  appeal  was  granted  with  express
    reference to the case of Yoshikazu Iida v Stadt Ulm  (Case  No  C14/11)
    judgment (Third Chamber) of 8th November 2012.  Here it  was  said  (at
    paragraph 70) that a court "must examine whether  the  refusal  of  the
    right of residence undermines a right to respect for private and family
    life provided for in Article 7 of the charter".

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 22nd July 2014, I  had  the  benefit  of  a
    skeleton argument from Mr Francis Hoare, which adequately set  out  his
    submissions before me.  Mr Hoare began by pointing out that there  were
    a number of fundamental errors in the approach of the judge.  The  most
    important of these was a failure to actually decide that which  had  to
    be decided as a question of fact by the judge.   The  judge  had  ample
    evidence before her consisting, for example, of a number  of  witnesses
    (see paragraphs 28 to 30) in the form of witness statements, and  there
    was also the evidence of the Appellant herself, but the  judge  decided
    that, "In the absence of supporting witnesses  and  cogent  documentary
    evidence ..... I conclude that the inconsistencies in the account given
    to me by the Appellant is such that she has not discharged  the  burden
    of proof ..." (paragraph 35).

11. Inconsistencies, submitted Mr Hoare, are relevant to  the  findings  of
    reliability, but they are not decisive and there is no  requirement  of
    cogent documentary evidence to support what is  being  said.   In  fact
    this was a case where the Appellant had always  lived  with  her  child
    Xihao Xu, a British citizen, and if she  was  not  to  be  the  primary
    carer, it was difficult to see who would be the primary carer.

12. But most importantly, the fundamental question as to  whether  she  did
    care for her child was never put to  her  by  either  Counsel  for  the
    Respondent or by the judge herself.   At  the  same  time  the  refusal
    letter had accepted that, "This department ... believes that Mr Xu  has
    some parental contact with the child"  which  suggested  that  he,  the
    father, did not have full parental care of the child, or even  most  of
    it, because this language suggests that, the  child  was  being  looked
    after by someone else.  That person could only have been the  Appellant
    with whom the child was  living.   Furthermore,  no  consideration  was
    given to the child at  all  by  the  judge  and  to  what  the  child's
    requirements might have been.

13. Yet, submitted Mr Hoare, there was ample evidence before the judge that
    would have led her, on a balance of probabilities, to conclude that the
    Appellant was the primary carer of the child.  This was clear from  the
    tenancy agreement in the Appellant's name (see page 8 of  the  bundle);
    the letter from Riverview Primary School dated 21st March (at  page  15
    of the bundle); and a statement from the stepfather of the  Appellant's
    husband (at page 17).  What was remarkable was that although the  judge
    referred to letters of support of the Appellant (at paragraph  28),  no
    mention was  made  whatsoever  of  the  letter  at  page  17  from  the
    stepfather.

14. Had this been referred to, it would have discharged the burden of proof
    in favour of the Appellant.  It is true that three witnesses, who  gave
    witness statements but did not  attend,  were  not  subject  to  cross-
    examination, but they all collectively made the  same  point  that  the
    Appellant was a single mother who looked after her own child.

15. If there was any doubt about any of these matters, she should have been
    cross-examined on this specific point.  She was not.  The judge did not
    put any questions to her either.   Instead,  the  judge  held  that  he
    simply could not decide because of the inconsistencies.  Yet, there  is
    no allegation that the Appellant had been dishonest  in  what  she  was
    saying.

16. For his part, Mr Avery submitted that the inconsistencies were such  as
    to prevent the judge from coming  to  firm  findings.   The  judge  was
    entitled to conclude as she did.  Evidence had been considered  in  the
    round and the judge had concluded that she  was  not  a  primary  carer
    under EU law.  It was difficult to see what else the judge  could  have
    done.

17. In reply, Mr Hoare submitted that I should make a finding of  an  error
    of law and then I should remake the decision on  the  following  facts.
    First, the Appellant had always lived with her own  child,  who  was  a
    British citizen child,  and  the  evidence  was  there  to  show  this.
    Second, she had the tenancy of her residency in the agreement with her.
     Third, her father had almost nothing to do with  the  child  and  this
    evidence was before the judge.  All three of these  facts  were  before
    the judge, notwithstanding any credibility issues that remained for her
    to get around.  Fourth, the witness statement  of  the  stepfather  (at
    page 17) was of crucial significance and yet the failure to  take  into
    account was a fundamental error.  But most importantly,  it  was  never
    put to her that she was not  the  primary  carer  of  the  child.   The
    Secretary of State never so suggested in direct terms  in  the  refusal
    letter.  If she was a single mother  then  she  would  win  her  appeal
    because of the principles in ZH (Tanzania), which states no matter  how
    bad her immigration record, persons  could  not  be  visited  upon  her
    child, who she looked after.  I should allow the appeal.

Error of Law

18. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.  First, this is a case where  the
    single most  important  issue  before  the  Tribunal  was  whether  the
    Appellant was a primary carer of her child, a  British  citizen.   This
    question was not put to the Appellant either by the representative  for
    the Respondent or by the judge.  It is an  important  feature  of  this
    case that the Appellant lived with her own child and always  had  done.
    Second, it is an error to say  that  ""In  the  absence  of  supporting
    witnesses and cogent documentary evidence .....  I  conclude  that  the
    inconsistencies in the account given to me by  the  Appellant  is  such
    that she has not discharged the burden of proof  ..."  (paragraph  35),
    especially given that the  refusal  letter  had  accepted  that,  "This
    department ... believes that Mr Xu has some parental contact  with  the
    child" simply because of the inconsistencies.  It was very difficult to
    know from the findings made what the judge did decide in terms  of  the
    specific facts which were before the Tribunal.

Remaking the Decision

19. I remake the decision on the basis of  the  findings  of  the  original
    judge, the evidence before her, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the following reasons.

20. First, there is the evidence.   This  consisted  fundamentally  of  the
    evidence of the landlord of the Appellant, the evidence from the NHS of
    the Appellant's involvement as a mother in the life of her  child,  and
    the fact that the Appellant had day-to-day care of her child (something
    which is seemingly conceded in the refusal letter).

21. Second, there is the refusal letter itself.  This is  predicated  on  a
    false basis.  Its emphasis is very much on "whether the child would  be
    unable to remain in the UK should the Appellant be  forced  to  leave",
    which is not the issue which the Respondent had to  decide.   What  the
    Respondent had to  decide  was  whether  under  Regulation  18  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 the Appellant had
    the right to remain in the UK as a primary carer of her child.

22. The evidence also consisted  of  the  very  marginal  presence  of  the
    child's father in her life.  He had only  visited  the  child  on  four
    occasions.  These were on 21st  January  2011  when  he  was  still  in
    hospital after the birth of Zihao, when on 4th February 2011 he met the
    Appellant at the registration office for the registration of her birth,
    and when she got very ill at night with a fever, and when he met her on
    another occasion in 2013.  Therefore, he did not have primary  care  of
    the child.

23. That left the question of whether the stepfather, Chan Coong Phung, had
    a role to play in her  life.   The  Appellant  states  in  her  witness
    statement that she had visited Mr Xu's stepfather,  Chan  Coong  Phung,
    with Zihao on a number of occasions, but this was when Mr  Xu  was  not
    present, and Mr Xu had never visited her in her own house.   There  was
    no evidence, and none shown by  the  Respondent,  that  the  stepfather
    played the role of a primary carer for the child, Zihao.

24. The judge at first instance did not find that the Appellant was not the
    mother of the child Zihao.  There had never been  any  suggestion  that
    any other person cared for the child.  There were, on the  other  hand,
    letters produced from witnesses, whose identity was  not  impugned,  to
    the effect that the child, Zihao, lived with the Appellant alone.   One
    of these witnesses was the landlord.

25. I have no reason to believe that, taking the facts  as  a  whole,  that
    this evidence is not to be taken at face value.  The Appellant  herself
    lived in her own property of which she had a tenancy agreement and  she
    lived with the child, Zihao.  She was a  single  mother.   She  was  in
    receipt of regular payments of �2,000 into her account, and there is no
    reason to believe that these monies come in,  which  they  do,  in  any
    other way than what she maintains.

26. In Zambrano, the ECJ explained the application of Article 20  TFEU  and
    stated that this "precludes national measures which have the effect  of
    depriving citizens of  the  Union  of  the  genuine  enjoyment  of  the
    substance of the rights conferred by virtue of the status  as  citizens
    of the union" (paragraph 42).

27. The child, Zihao, is a citizen of the Union and she is entitled to  the
    "genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights" as a citizen of  the
    Union.  In Zambrano the ECJ also stated that,

         "A refusal to grant  a  right  of  residence  to  a  third  country
         national with dependent minor children in the  member  state  where
         those children are nationals and reside,  and  also  a  refusal  to
         grant such a person a work permit, has such an effect.   (Paragraph
         43)

28. On any view, a child who lives with her single mother, in that mother's
    tenanted property, with no other adult around her, is a dependent minor
    child on her mother, and there is no evidence to the contrary, and none
    was actually pinpointed in the refusal letter.

29. In circumstances where the father, Mr Xu,  has  only  been  around  the
    child, Zihao, when he has had to  be  there,  and  that  only  on  four
    occasions, I find that if this Appellant is required to return  to  her
    country, then, "it must be assumed that such a refusal would lead to  a
    situation where" the child, Zihao as a "citizen  of  the  Union,  would
    have to leave the territory of the Union in  order  to  accompany"  her
    mother (see paragraph 44 of Zambrano).

30. The effect of this would be that as a citizen of the Union,  the  child
    Zihao, would "be  unable  to  exercise  the  substance  of  the  rights
    conferred on them by virtue of their status as citizens of  the  Union"
    (see paragraph 44).  Accordingly, as a matter of treaty law this appeal
    must be allowed.   It  must  also  be  allowed  on  the  basis  of  the
    principles set out  with  respect  to  Article  8  ECHR  rights  in  ZH
    (Tanzania) where the Supreme Court found that the  "inevitable  result"
    of a mother being removed would be that the children would have to move
    with her, though I need not  decide  this  question  given  that  I  am
    allowing this appeal under Regulation 18 of the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  Were I to decide  it,  I  would  find
    that the "best interests" of the child, Zihao, are served by  remaining
    in this country, and if this was the case under Section 55  BCIA  2009,
    then this must be  a  relevant  consideration  for  the  assessment  of
    Article 8 ECHR rights, with respect to the child, Zihao.  However, as I
    have indicated, I do not decide this point.

Decision

31. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed.

32. No anonymity order is made.
