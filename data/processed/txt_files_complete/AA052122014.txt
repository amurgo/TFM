                                  Anonymity

       The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to  rule  45(4)(i)  of
       the Asylum and  Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

        I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008)  and  consequently,  this  determination
       identifies the appellant by initials only.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan who was born on 1st  January,
    1993.  His immigration history merits setting out in full.

Immigration History

2.   He entered the United Kingdom clandestinely on 20th May, 2008  and  was
    served with form IS151A and made an application for  asylum.   On  24th
    July,  2008  the  asylum  claim  was  refused,  but  he   was   granted
    discretionary leave until 1st July, 2010, as he  was  an  unaccompanied
    minor.  On 24th June 2010, he lodged application for further  leave  to
    remain which was considered and  refused  by  the  respondent  on  12th
    October, 2010.

2.   The appellant then lodged an appeal on 28th October, 2010, and on  19th
    January, 2011, his application was referred back to  the  Secretary  of
    State for reconsideration of some sort.  On  2nd  February,  2011,  the
    application was reconsidered and refused and the  appellant  lodged  an
    appeal on 17th February, 2011, which was heard on 17th March that  year
    and dismissed on 5th April, 2011.

The first appeal

3.   That was the determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Harris  ('the
    Harris  determination').   On  15th  April,  2011  the  appellant  made
    application for permission to appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  which
    was refused on 4th May, 2011.  He exhausted his appeal rights  on  18th
    May, 2011 and on 19th May  that  year  he  ceased  complying  with  his
    reporting conditions.  He was considered to be an immigration absconder
    on 10th November, 2011.

4.   On 31st August, 2012, the appellant was encountered trying  to  smuggle
    himself out of the United Kingdom in the rear of a freight vehicle.  He
    was detained as a person liable to removal from the United Kingdom  and
    served with directions for  his  removal.   On  12th  September,  2012,
    judicial review proceedings were sought  and  removal  directions  were
    subsequently deferred.  Further representations were considered by  the
    Secretary of State but  these  were  refused  on  26th  February  2013.
    Further representations were made on 18th June,  2014  and  these  were
    refused on 15th July, 2014.

The second appeal.

5.   On 28th July 2014, the appellant exercised his right under  Section  82
    of the 2002 Act and his  appeal  was  heard  at  Taylor  House  on  5th
    February, 2015, by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davidson.  The First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge  properly  referred  to  the  Harris  determination  and
    recognised that he was bound by the decision of the former  Immigration
    appeal  Tribunal  in  Devaseelan  (Second  Appeals  -  ECHR  -   Extra-
    Territorial Effect) Sri Lanka * [2002] UKIAT 00702.

6.   The First Tier Tribunal Judge purported to apply the  country  guidance
    case of GS  (Article  15(c)  indiscriminate  violence)  Afghanistan  CG
    [2009] UKIAT 00044 and considered evidence from  Amnesty  International
    and from Dr Giustozzi, an expert employed to produce a report on behalf
    of the appellant, but noted that neither the  Amnesty  report  nor  the
    expert report referred to the  case  of  GF  (Afghanistan)  and,  as  a
    result, the First Tier Tribunal Judge suggested that those reports were
    not deserving of full weight.  He dismissed the appellant's  appeal  on
    asylum grounds and on humanitarian  protection  grounds  and  concluded
    that the appellant would be able to relocate to Afghanistan.

7.   At the end of paragraph 43 of his determination, the  judge  says  that
    he has no evidence one way or the other in respect of  the  appellant's
    family members and therefore makes no finding as to whether or not  the
    appellant has a family in  Afghanistan.   At  paragraph  45  the  judge
    suggests that there  is  no  need  for  the  respondent  to  trace  the
    appellant's family, because the judge is persuaded that, "the appellant
    is now an adult and well able to establish contact with  them  himself,
    if he wants to.  Some of his family were obviously  concerned  for  his
    welfare since they sent him to the UK.  It is inconceivable that  those
    members of his family would not still be concerned for his welfare  and
    welcome him back on return to Afghanistan".  Apart from  anything  else
    that is a contradictory finding.

8.   The determination is challenged, however, firstly because it  fails  to
    take account of the more recent country guidance decision of the  Upper
    Tribunal in AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00163,  which
    in Section B of the head  note,  makes  it  clear  that  that  decision
    replaces GS.  Had the judge considered AK and in particular  paragraphs
    224 to 253 of it, he would have  realised  the  need  to  consider  the
    appellant's personal circumstances  and  would  have  realised  it  was
    insufficient to approach the question of relocation by asking if  there
    is evidence to depart from the  finding  in  GS.  That  was  the  wrong
    approach.  He also failed properly to consider the expert  evidence  by
    suggesting that it was not deserving of full weight because it referred
    to GS.

9.   Mr Jarvis has sought to persuade me that the conclusions in AK  and  GS
    are the same.  They are very similar but, with respect to him, they are
    not the same.  I have concluded  that  this  appeal  does  need  to  be
    reconsidered afresh.  I set aside the decision.

10.  In remaking  the  decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  will,  of
    course, be  bound  by  Devaseelan  (Second  Appeals  -  ECHR  -  Extra-
    Territorial Effect) Sri Lanka * [2002] UKIAT 00702, but insofar  as  he
    or she hears further evidence from the appellant,  they  will  have  to
    make their own findings of fact and they will also have to  assess  the
    appellant's credibility. It is only after having  considered  carefully
    the appellant's personal circumstances that the Tribunal will  then  be
    in a position to properly assess the risk to this appellant  on  return
    by applying AK (Afghanistan) and paying particular regard to paragraphs
    224 to 253 of it.



Notice of Decision

    I have decided that the appeal shall  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for hearing afresh before a First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other
    than First-tier Tribunal Davidson

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
