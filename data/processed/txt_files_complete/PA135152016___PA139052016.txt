                                                                  Appellants
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr E MacKay, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    David C Clapham SSC, promulgated on 21 March 2017.

 2. The grounds are detailed, running to 35 paragraphs over 8 � pages.

 3. On 28 July 2017 FtT Judge Kimnell granted permission:

      "The grounds are far too prolix.  The  essential  point  is  that  the
      judge arguably erred by not merely treating the findings of an earlier
      judge as a starting point on Devaseelan  principles,  but  also  as  a
      finishing point, without assessing  or  making  any  findings  on  the
      evidence in the current appeal and applying current  country  guidance
      to those findings."

 4. Mr Matthews conceded that  the  essential  point  in  the  grounds,  as
    extracted by the permission judge, had merit.   The  previous  decision
    was  reached  by  reference  to  guidance  then  current.   The   judge
    mistakenly thought that he should apply the old  and  not  the  updated
    guidance, and that the previous finding that the appellant's activities
    were "at a significantly low level" (�58) resolved the case.  That  was
    no longer the test. The error could not be corrected  by  applying  the
    guidance to the facts found, because the judge failed to make  findings
    on the further evidence and materials offered by the appellants.

 5. Parties agreed on the following outcome.

 6. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

 7. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 8. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge David C Clapham SSC.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
