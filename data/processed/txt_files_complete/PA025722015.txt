                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


 1. This is an appeal against a decision promulgated on  25  July  2016  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge C  M  Phillips.   The  decision  refused  the
    asylum and human rights claim of the appellant  in  the  context  of  a
    deportation order.

 2. The case has a somewhat complicated history. The appellant came to  the
    United Kingdom in 2001 as a dependant of his parents  and  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in line with them  on  15  July  2002.   His
    father had been recognised as a refugee and the other  members  of  the
    family granted leave in line with the father

 3. After having been granted indefinite leave  to  remain,  the  appellant
    commenced a series of  criminal  offences.   The  most  serious  was  a
    conviction on 24 May 2013 for robbery for which, on 11  July  2013,  he
    was sentenced to twenty months' imprisonment.

 4. The appellant claimed asylum on 9 October 2013.  That claim and a human
    rights claim based on his Article 8 rights were refused on  21  October
    2015.  The respondent made a deportation order against the appellant on
    22 October 2015.

 5. The appellant appealed against the refusal of his protection and  human
    rights claims.  In his  appeal  he  was  initially  represented  by  KQ
    Solicitors.  A hearing was listed for 25  April  2016.   The  appellant
    wrote to the Tribunal requesting an adjournment of that hearing  as  KQ
    Solicitors were asking for enhanced fees which he could not pay and  he
    needed time to find a legal representative who would charge  him  less.
    The appellant also maintained  that  KQ  Solicitors  were  refusing  to
    release important papers from his file unless he paid  �1,000.  He  was
    not prepared to pay them as  he  considered  their  services  had  been
    inadequate.  On the basis of that application the hearing of  25  April
    2016 was adjourned.  A new hearing was listed for 23 June 2016.

 6. The appellant then transferred instructions to Ratna & Co  on  14  June
    2016.  In a letter dated 15 June 2016 Ratna & Co  went  on  record  and
    indicated that there were ongoing difficulties  in  obtaining  original
    documents from the  asylum  claim  from  KQ  Solicitors  and  that  the
    appellant had made a formal complaint to the Legal Ombudsman.

 7. Ratna & Co wrote again to the Tribunal on 17 June 2016. They  requested
    an adjournment. The letter is at page 112  of  the  appellant's  bundle
    prepared for this hearing submitted under a cover letter dated 14  July
    2017. The letter of 17 June 2016 states as follows:

         "Our client has complained about the  services  received  from  his
         previous representative namely KQ Solicitors who  are  refusing  to
         release the original documents to our client and  also  refund  the
         payment he has made.  Our client has therefore  complained  to  the
         Legal Ombudsman who is currently investigating this matter.

         On checking the list of  documents  which  are  with  his  previous
         representatives,  we  note  there  are  some  documents  which  are
         important for his  Asylum  as  well  as  Human  Rights  Appeal,  we
         therefore seek adjournment  of  the  hearing  in  the  interest  of
         justice."

 8. The letter concluded by stating "if the  appeal  proceeds  without  the
    original documents, it may prejudice his Asylum as well as Human Rights
    claim."

 9. The adjournment request  was  refused.  It  was  renewed  before  Judge
    Phillips at the hearing on 23 June 2016. A  skeleton  argument  setting
    out the adjournment request was provided and oral submissions made. The
    skeleton argument referred to the missing documents  as  "crucial"  and
    set out the head note of Nwaigwe (adjournment:  fairness)  [2014]  UKUT
    00418 (IAC):

         "If a Tribunal refuses to accede to an  adjournment  request,  such
         decision could, in  principle,  be  erroneous  in  law  in  several
         respects: these include a failure to take into account all material
         considerations; permitting immaterial  considerations  to  intrude;
         denying the party concerned a fair hearing; failing  to  apply  the
         correct test; and acting irrationally.  In practice, in most  cases
         the question will be whether  the  refusal  deprived  the  affected
         party of his right to a fair hearing.  Where an adjournment refusal
         is challenged on fairness grounds, it  is  important  to  recognise
         that the question for the Upper Tribunal is  not  whether  the  FtT
         acted reasonably.  Rather, the  test  to  be  applied  is  that  of
         fairness:  was there any deprivation of the affected party's  right
         to a fair hearing? See SH (Afghanistan) v Secretary  of  State  for
         the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 1284."

10. Judge Phillips refused the adjournment request and proceeded to  refuse
    the appeal on all grounds.  The decision deals with the adjournment  in
    [13] to [20] of the decision:

         "13. Directions were sent to the appellant  and  respondent  on  22
             February 2016 for a hearing on 25 April 2016.   The  appellant
             wrote on 15  April  2016  requesting  an  adjournment  of  the
             hearing fixed for 25 April 2016 because his current  solicitor
             was demanding more money, which the appellant  cannot  afford.
             The appellant states that he is not in a position to pay �2500
             to his solicitor and needs time to find a  solicitor  that  he
             can afford.  The appellant  attached  an  e-mail  including  a
             letter from his representatives stating that a  fixed  fee  of
             �2500 was agreed and due to limited communication and lack  of
             instructions the appellant's bundle for the  appeal  had  been
             only  part  prepared.   The  appellant  was  advised  that  as
             discussed the representatives were unable to release the  file
             of papers until payment of �1000 was made for the work carried
             out  so  far.   Once  this   payment   was   made   then   the
             representatives would release  the  papers.   The  adjournment
             request was granted and the case relisted for 23 June 2016.

         14.  On 17 June 2016 new representatives wrote requesting a further
             adjournment stating that the appellant  has  complained  about
             the services of his previous representatives who are  refusing
             to release his papers.  The appellant has  complained  to  the
             Legal  Ombudsman,  who  is  investigating.   There  were  some
             documents, which were important, and it was submitted that the
             appeal could not proceed without these.  A list  of  documents
             was provided, which were said to be in the possession  of  the
             appellant's previous representative.  The adjournment  request
             was accompanied by a letter of complaint dated 07  June  2016,
             from the  appellant  to  his  previous  representatives.   The
             appellant also provided a letter dated 09 June 2016  from  the
             Legal Ombudsman intimating that the  complaint  could  not  be
             investigated because the  appellant  was  still  within  eight
             weeks of making his complaint.  The  adjournment  request  was
             refused b the Designated Immigration Judge with  reference  to
             Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT  00418  (IAC)  and
             the appellant's representative was informed.

         15.  The adjournment request was repeated at the hearing, which the
             appellant  attended  along  with   his   new   representative,
             instructed on 13 June 2016.  The appellant's bundle was lodged
             at court and the appellant's representative received a copy of
             the respondent's bundle.  There was a  Tamil  interpreter  and
             the appellant's parents attended,  both  of  whom  required  a
             Tamil interpreter.  The adjournment request was  made  on  the
             basis that the appellant's representative required  more  time
             to read the papers and take instructions; a formal request had
             been made and the release of the documents from  the  previous
             solicitors was  awaited;  the  previous  solicitors  will  not
             release the documents until  the  outstanding  fees  had  been
             paid; the appellant had made a  complaint;  crucial  documents
             were with the previous solicitor; the appellant's  bundle  had
             been prepared without  the  respondent's  bundle  and  despite
             directions no OASys Report had been provided.

         16.  I pointed out that the respondent  could  not  rely  upon  the
             findings if the OASys report had not been provided;  the  case
             had been adjourned in February at the appellant's request  and
             again in April when all the issues relied upon were the  same.
             The appellant confirmed that the issues were the  same  stated
             it had taken him 3 to 4 weeks to obtain a  new  representative
             and he had had difficulty instructing solicitors  due  to  the
             lack of documents.

         17.  The  adjournment  request  was  opposed  by  the  respondent's
             representative because of the history.  The onus  was  on  the
             appellant to obtain representation and pay the agreed fees.  A
             problem paying the fees did not provide a reason  to  adjourn.
             The respondent's representative had spoken to the  appellant's
             representative three days before and could have  provided  the
             respondent's bundle then, but was not asked to do so.  So  far
             as the medical documents of  the  parents  were  concerned  it
             would  be  expected  that  these  could  be   obtained.    The
             respondent accepts that the appellant's parents  have  asylum.
             The issue is the appellant's risk on return to Sri  Lanka  and
             the grant of asylum to the appellant's parents has no  bearing
             on this.  Article 8 has to be decided on  the  evidence.   The
             appellant's fianc�e had not attended and there is  no  medical
             evidence to show that she is unfit.  The  adjournment  request
             should be refused and the case proceed.

         18.  The  appellant's  representative  submitted  that  the  asylum
             documents  were  with  the   previous   representative.    The
             paperwork to support, Article 8, live in the UK was still with
             the previous representative.  There had been limited  time  to
             obtain documents relative to the appellant's  fianc�e.   There
             was no OASys Report despite directions asking  the  respondent
             to obtain this.  I pointed out that the dispute over access to
             papers could take months to resolve unless the appellant  paid
             the outstanding fees because the representatives were  holding
             the papers until payment was made and the  appellant  did  not
             intend to  pay.   The  appellant  was  clear  that  he  had  a
             complaint and did  not  intend  to  pay  the  fees.   I  tried
             unsuccessfully to find out what was missing, what  was  likely
             to be obtained if an adjournment granted and  from  this  what
             could be considered to be determinative.

         19.   The  appellant's  representative  had  prepared  a   skeleton
             argument in support of the application to adjourn.  In this my
             attention was drawn to Nwaigwe.

         20.  In all the circumstances I refused the adjournment request.  I
             had been provided with  an  appellant's  bundle,  including  a
             witness statement and I considered that I  was  empowered  and
             required to refuse the adjournment request  and  that  refusal
             was in keeping with the over-riding objective of fairness  and
             the 2014 Procedure Rules.  The appellant  had  instructed  his
             present representative 10 days before the hearing.  The issues
             in the refusal could all be pursued during the oral  evidence.
             I allowed the photocopying of some additional papers  produced
             on the day; and, allowed the appellant's  representative  time
             at  court  to  prepare  with  the  appellant,  before  hearing
             evidence when the appellant's representative indicated that he
             was ready to proceed."

11. The core decision on the adjournment is at [18] and [20].  In  my  view
    the reasoning fails to address  material  aspects  of  the  appellant's
    adjournment application.  It remained the position  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal that documents with potential materiality to  the  asylum
    and human rights case, some of them originals, were not available.  The
    First-tier Tribunal accepts this to be so at [18]. This was not  simply
    because the appellant refused to or could not pay �1,000 as set out  in
    [18]. The materials before the First-tier Tribunal indicated  that  the
    appellant considered that the level of service in the  preparation  and
    progression of his case by his  previous  advisers  was  such  that  he
    should not be expected to pay them �1,000 and his genuine  belief  that
    this was so  was  evidenced  by  the  formal  complaint  to  the  Legal
    Ombudsman.

12. In addition, his new legal representatives, had not been provided  with
    the full materials from his claim, including  originals  of  documents,
    and maintained that they were not in a position to compensate  for  the
    alleged shortcomings of the previous solicitors and  prepare  the  case
    adequately.  Those factors were not such that Ratna & Co could have but
    did not remedy them in the 10 days that they were instructed  prior  to
    the hearing. The reasons for finding that it was fair to  proceed  does
    not explain how that could be so if potentially  material  evidence  in
    the asylum and Article 8 claim was missing.

13. Whilst having some sympathy for the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  faced
    with the of a  number  of  witnesses  being  ready  to  be  heard,  the
    interpreter being ready and there having been an  earlier  adjournment,
    it is my conclusion  that  the  refusal  to  adjourn  did  deprive  the
    appellant of the right to a fair hearing, particularly where this is  a
    protection claim requiring anxious scrutiny.

14. If more were needed, the absence of some of the original  documents  is
    shown to have been a potentially material matter  by  the  findings  at
    [56] and [59]  on  the  appellant's  sur  place  claim  and  copies  of
    photographs to support that claim. The originals were not available and
    the copies were  not  found  to  be  sufficiently  clear  to  show  the
    appellant attending a  number  of  Tamil  Government  in  Exile  (TGTE,
    referred to in the decision as TNG).

15. For these reasons I found that the refusal of the  adjournment  request
    amounted to an error on a point of law such that the decision had to be
    set aside to be remade.  The parties were in agreement that  where  the
    appellant had not had a fair hearing the appeal should  be  re-made  in
    the First-tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error  on  a  point  of
law and is set aside to be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.

The appeal will be heard at Taylor House not before Judge C M Phillips
