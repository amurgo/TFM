JUDGMENT


UTJ GLEESON:  The applicant has permission to seek judicial  review  of  the
      respondent's decision on 22 June 2016 to refuse him  indefinite  leave
      to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant pursuant
      to paragraph 245CD of the Immigration Rules HC395 (as  amended),  with
      reference to paragraphs 19(i) and 19J(iv) of Appendix A and  paragraph
      322(5) of the general grounds for refusal in the Rules.

Background

   2. The applicant is a citizen of Pakistan born in 1984 and now  34  years
      old.  He entered the United Kingdom on 3 September 2007 age  24,  with
      student entry clearance  valid  until  31  October  2009.   Subsequent
      applications extended his student leave to 30 August 2010.  On 15 June
      2010, the applicant applied for leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (Post-
      Study Work) Migrant and was granted leave to remain until 6 July  2012
      on that basis.

   3. On 28 February 2011, the applicant made  an  unsuccessful  application
      for Tier 1 (General) Migrant status.  On 6 April 2011,  the  applicant
      reapplied for Tier 1 (General)  Migrant  status  and  was  successful:
      leave to remain was granted from 3 May 2011 to 3 May 2013.  On 5 April
      2013, the applicant applied for further leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
      (General) Migrant and was granted leave to remain from 21 May 2013  to
      21 May 2016.

   4. The applicant has made discrepant declarations  of  his  employed  and
      self-employed income for the tax year 2010/2011, as follows:

     a) On 6 April 2011 in his Tier 1 application,  the  applicant  claimed
        total earnings of �40,665.74, being �6070.74 from Euro Car Park and
        �37,850 from self-employment.

     b) In his HMRC tax return for the same year, the applicant claimed and
        paid tax on total earnings of �12,330, being �9557 salary and �2773
        for self-employment.

     c) On 13 January 2014, almost 3 years after filing his  incorrect  tax
        return, the applicant notified HMRC  of  an  under-declaration  for
        2010/2011.   He  now  declared  that  he  had  earned   �9557   for
        employment, but just �26,713 for self-employment,  not  �34,595  as
        asserted in his Tier 1 application in April 2011.

     d) A continuing discrepancy of �7,882 between  the  April  2011  self-
        employed income and  the  January  2014  adjustment  has  not  been
        declared or explained.

   5. HMRC chose not to prosecute the applicant for  the  incorrect  return.
      Instead, in a letter  dated  14  March  2014,  HMRC  acknowledged  the
      applicant's declaration of additional income, said to  be  related  to
      incorrect deductions.  The letter stated that it was too late to amend
      the return but HMRC served an additional  assessment  to  collect  the
      under-declared  tax,  interest  and  penalties.   The  applicant   had
      previously been assessed to pay �555 tax.   The  adjusted  amount  was
      �7022.84, leaving �6467.84 still  to  pay.   The  applicant  paid  the
      adjusted amount.

   6. The tax and salary details in the Tier 1 application on 17 April  2013
      matched the sums declared.

   7. The applicant's Tier 1 indefinite leave to remain application was made
      on 4 April 2016, before his existing leave  expired.   The  respondent
      refused further leave due to the discrepancy between  the  applicants'
      claimed income in 2010-2011 in the Tier  1  application  and  the  sum
      declared in his 2011 HMRC tax return.  A higher corrective declaration
      made in 2014 still leaves  a  difference  of  �7882  between  the  two
      figures.

Immigration Rules

   8. So far as relevant, paragraph 245CD is as follows:

      "245CD. Requirements for indefinite leave to remain

      To qualify for indefinite leave to remain, a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant
      must meet the requirements listed below. If the applicant meets  these
      requirements, indefinite leave to  remain  will  be  granted.  If  the
      applicant does not meet these requirements, the  application  will  be
      refused.

      Requirements:
      (a)   DELETED
      (b)   The applicant must  not  fall  for  refusal  under  the  general
           grounds for refusal (except that  paragraph  322(1C)  shall  not
           apply if the applicant  meets  the  conditions  in  (f)(i)-(iii)
           below), and must not be an illegal entrant.
      (c)   The applicant must have spent a continuous period  as  specified
           in (d) lawfully in the UK, of which the most recent period  must
           have been spent with leave as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, in any
           combination of the following categories:
           (i) as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, ...
       (d)  The continuous period in (c) is:
            (i)   [does not apply to this applicant]
            (ii)  5 years, in all other cases. ...
      [(e) and (f) do not apply to this applicant]
      (g)   In all cases other than those referred to in (e) or  (f)  above,
           the applicant must have 80 points under paragraphs 7  to  34  of
           Appendix A ...
      (m)   The application for indefinite leave to remain  must  have  been
           made before 6 April 2018."

   9.  In  Appendix  A,  the  respondent  relied  on  paragraph  19  and  in
      particular, sub-paragraphs 19(i) and 19(j)(iv):

      "19. ...(i) The Secretary of State must be satisfied that the earnings
           are from genuine employment. If the Secretary of  State  is  not
           satisfied, points for those earnings will not be awarded.

           (j)   In making the assessment in paragraph 19(i), the Secretary
                 of State will assess on the balance  of  probabilities  and
                 may take into account the following factors: ...

                 (iv)   verification  of  previous  earnings   claims   with
                 declarations made in respect  of  the  applicant  to  other
                 Government  Departments,  including  declarations  made  in
                 respect of earnings claimed by the  applicant  in  previous
                 applications;    ..."                             [Emphasis
                 added]

  10. Paragraph 322(5) of the general grounds for refusal, which is  one  of
      those where leave 'should normally be refused' is as follows:

      "Refusal of leave to remain, variation of leave to enter or remain  or
      curtailment of leave

      322.  In addition to the grounds for refusal of extension of stay  set
           out in Parts 2-8 of these Rules, the following provisions  apply
           in relation to the  refusal  of  an  application  for  leave  to
           remain,  variation  of  leave  to  enter  or  remain  or,  where
           appropriate, the curtailment of leave...

      Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave  to  enter  or
      remain in the United Kingdom should normally be refused

      (5)   the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to  remain
           in the United Kingdom in the light  of  his  conduct  (including
           convictions  which  do  not  fall  within   paragraph   322(1C),
           character or associations or  the  fact  that  he  represents  a
           threat to national security; ..."

Refusal letter

  11. The respondent considered the evidence of  the  applicant's  financial
      declarations against that structure,  taking  into  account  the  late
      declaration on 13 January 2014 of the under-declared  income  for  the
      tax year 2010/2011.  The respondent was satisfied that  the  applicant
      had made that declaration in order to match  and  justify  the  higher
      earnings claimed in his April 2011 application.  She  considered  that
      the applicant had been deceitful or dishonest  in  his  dealings  with
      either or both of the respondent and HMRC, either by under-declaration
      of genuine earnings for tax, or  by  falsely  representing  his  self-
      employed income to earn more points and obtain leave to remain.

  12. The respondent considered whether she should  exercise  her  paragraph
      322(5) discretion in the applicant's favour, but declined to do so  on
      the basis that she was not satisfied that the error was genuine.   She
      was not satisfied that a registered accountant would under-declare the
      applicant's earnings, or make an error in the  applicable  deductions,
      to the extent of almost �29,000.  Further, the  respondent  considered
      that it was the applicant's responsibility  to  ensure  that  his  tax
      return was correct and all his income was declared on time.

  13. The applicant was not awarded the 80 points needed  for  a  successful
      application.  The respondent gave him 20 points for his  age,  35  for
      his qualifications, but no  points  for  earnings  or  United  Kingdom
      experience (which is related).  The  applicant  was  awarded  only  55
      points and his application failed.

Administrative reviews

  14. There were two administrative reviews of  the  respondent's  decision,
      the first decided on 5 August 2016 and the second on 22  August  2016.
      In his application for administrative  review  on  9  July  2016,  the
      applicant said that the respondent's decision was procedurally  unfair
      and that the respondent should have disclosed the evidence relied upon
      underlying her conclusion  that  the  applicant  had  declared  higher
      earnings  in  order  to  reach  the  points  level  for  his  previous
      application.

  15. The respondent maintained her position that  it  was  the  applicant's
      responsibility to ensure that his tax return was correctly filed,  and
      that she did not believe that the applicant's  accountant  would  have
      made such a huge error, or that if he had,  the  applicant  would  not
      have noticed and corrected it.   The  administrative  review  decision
      concluded:

           "Please note that discretion is not mandatory. The  Home  Office
           has reasonable cause to doubt the genuineness of  your  earnings
           claim made in your previous leave  to  remain  application  and,
           therefore, we are not satisfied that  exercising  discretion  in
           your favour would be the appropriate course of action.
           In light of the above, the Secretary of State is not  satisfied,
           on the balance of probabilities, that your claims have not  been
           fabricated to allow you to achieve the required points  for  the
           income threshold. ...We have therefore maintained  the  original
           decision."

  16. The applicant challenged that decision and  a  further  administrative
      review decision  was  issued,  which  considered  a  letter  from  the
      applicant's accountants saying that he was 'not culpable  at  all  for
      the alleged discrepancy'.  The  applicant  pointed  out  that  he  had
      declared  the  problem  when  completing  a   questionnaire   at   his
      appointment in Croydon, albeit with little detail.  The  question  and
      answer were as follows:

           "Q:   Have you ever needed  to  correct  or  resubmit  your  tax
           returns?  If yes, please provide details and the reason why  the
           return was incorrectly submitted?
           A.    The profit figure was  miscalculated  when  it  was  first
              submitted."

  17. The respondent was not satisfied with that explanation.  She  did  not
      consider that such a large discrepancy could be a  miscalculation,  or
      'nothing more than an anomaly' as the applicant alleged.  She said  in
      the second administrative review letter:

           "We do not find it acceptable that you would declare earnings to
           UKVI to gain leave to remain and subsequently not  declare  your
           full earnings to HMRC."

  18. The respondent rejected the applicant's assertion that the decision by
      the caseworker was not in accordance with her policy or was  otherwise
      unfair or irrational. The refusal  decision  was  maintained  and  the
      applicant proceeded to utilise the Pre-Action  Protocol  and  then  to
      issue judicial review proceedings.



Grounds for review

  19. The grounds for  review  allege  that  the  respondent's  decision  is
      unreasonable,  irrational,  and  unlawful,  in  the  context  of   her
      Modernised Guidance on the general grounds for refusal at Section 4 in
      version 24.0 of 4 February 2016.

  20. The applicant asserted that the respondent's caseworker had failed  to
      address or discharge the burden of proof on the respondent  and  that,
      in particular, the outcome of the first administrative review was 'the
      epitome of vaguity'.   Many authorities  on  burden  and  standard  of
      proof are cited.  In the context of any implicit  assertion  that  the
      applicant  had  committed  deception,  the  applicant  relied  on   AA
      (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ
      773, which  he  argued  'confirms  that  falsity  may  be  equiparated
      [compared] with an intention to lie or deceive'.   I do not understand
      this submission to be to the applicant's advantage.

  21. The thrust of the lengthy grounds for review is  that  the  respondent
      has not discharged the evidential burden upon her and the decision  is
      unlawful.   There  is,  he  says,  no  evidence  that  he  deceived  a
      government department.  Clear evidence  of  deceit  or  dishonesty  is
      required, he contends.  He relied on the rebuttal  evidence  from  his
      accountants that the under-declaration was entirely their fault and he
      was not culpable in respect of it.   The respondent's conclusion  that
      he had used deception was  'mere  conjecture  and  speculation'.   The
      applicant relied on his voluntary correction  of  his  tax  return  in
      January 2014.   It had not been open to the respondent to conclude, as
      she had, that his previous earnings were not genuine.

  22. The applicant made submissions about his Article 8 ECHR rights at [57]-
      [58] in the grounds for review, which were repeated and expanded in Mr
      Gill's skeleton argument and his oral submissions.   I have had regard
      to those submissions.

Grant of permission

  23. Permission for judicial review was granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
      Grubb, who considered it arguable that the respondent had wrongly  and
      irrationally  applied  paragraph  322(5)  in  the  light  of  her  own
      guidance, the applicant's explanation, and his subsequent  conduct  in
      submitting revised tax returns which were accepted by HMRC.

  24. Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb considered that it was an  arguable  public
      law error for the respondent to look behind the HMRC's  acceptance  of
      the evidence of income retrospectively declared in January 2014,  when
      applying paragraph 19(i) and 19(j)(iv).

Application to file detailed grounds of defence out of time

  25. The Tribunal  gave  case  management  directions  which  required  the
      respondent, if he wished to contest  the  application,  to  lodge  and
      provide to the applicant and any other parties  detailed  grounds,  or
      additional grounds, not later than 35 days from the sending out of the
      decision on 5 January 2017. A detailed timetable for  the  applicant's
      Reply, if any, and for skeleton arguments and bundles,  completed  the
      directions.

  26. The applicant's application was struck out automatically  for  failure
      to pay the continuation fee, but reinstated on 6 April 2017, with  the
      35-day time limit varied to run from the  date  of  the  reinstatement
      order, expiring on 11 May 2017.  The respondent took no steps to  file
      her detailed grounds until 28 July 2017, just over  11  weeks  outside
      the extended time limit.

  27. By an application notice dated 28 July  2017,  the  respondent  sought
      permission to file a combined 'skeleton argument and detailed  grounds
      of defence'.  This is a practice which the respondent  seems  to  have
      adopted recently.  It is not a good  one.   The  purpose  of  detailed
      grounds of defence is to give the applicant an opportunity  to  refine
      his pleaded case in the light of what the respondent says.  A skeleton
      argument is a later document, to be filed when all  the  evidence  and
      pleadings have been received: its purpose is to assist the  Judge  and
      the other party by focusing the arguments to be considered during  the
      hearing.  It  is  not  appropriate  to  conflate  the  two  documents,
      particularly without permission. Nor was it appropriate  to  file  the
      key document (the detailed grounds) on 28 July, just 1  clear  working
      day before the substantive hearing.

  28. I heard evidence from the respondent's caseworker,  Mr  Williams,  who
      adopted the  contents  of  the  application  for  extension  of  time,
      supported by a statement of truth, as  his  evidence  in  chief.    Mr
      Williams  confirmed  that  the  respondent  had  been  aware  of   the
      reinstatement of the application in April 2017. He said  that  he  was
      not the original caseworker but had been given the file in  early  May
      2017 to pick up: by that time, the respondent was up  against  the  11
      May deadline.  He noticed then that the detailed grounds had not  been
      prepared.

  29. Mr Williams accepted that he had not made an application  for  an  in-
      time extension of time.  He accepted that there had been a  discussion
      in early July between himself and the applicant's solicitors, although
      he  had  kept  no  note  of  it.   There  were  some  solicitor-client
      discussions on the respondent's side as  to  whether  the  application
      should be settled.   By  early  July  2017,  it  was  clear  that  the
      respondent would defend the application, but Mr Williams accepted that
      he did not engage promptly with the judicial review proceedings then.

  30. There was no cross-examination.

  31. I considered the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (as
      amended) at rules 7(2) and 2.  Rule 7 permits the  Upper  Tribunal  to
      take such action as it considers just where  a  party  has  failed  to
      comply with a direction, including (save where the case is  an  asylum
      case or an immigration case) restricting a  party's  participation  in
      the proceedings.  The present application is neither  an  asylum  case
      nor an immigration case as defined in rule 1.   Rule  2  contains  the
      overriding objective.

  32. I am not satisfied by the respondent's explanation for the delay.   It
      is not a potentially valid explanation (see JA (Ghana) v The Secretary
      of State for  the  Home  Department  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1031 and  The
      Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo) &  Ors  [2015]
      EWCA Civ 387).  I am not satisfied that it  is  in  the  interests  of
      justice or of the overriding objective  to  allow  the  respondent  to
      disregard the Upper Tribunal's directions in this manner.

  33. I refused to admit the detailed grounds/skeleton argument or to  allow
      Mr Malik to participate in the  proceedings.   I  have,  however,  had
      regard to the summary grounds which accompanied the acknowledgment  of
      service.

Submissions

  34. Mr Gill  relied  on  his  skeleton  argument,  which  incorporated  by
      reference  the  judicial  review  grounds.   He  contended  that   the
      respondent had alleged criminal conduct by the applicant, a deliberate
      and  dishonest  fraud  on  the  respondent  and/or   HMRC.    A   full
      investigation  should  have  been  conducted   before   reaching   the
      conclusion that such  criminal  conduct  had  been  established.   The
      respondent's reasons were no more  than  a  bare  inference  from  the
      disparity.

  35. The applicant had not been  interviewed  by  the  respondent,  and  no
      reason had been given for her decision  not  to  do  so.   Many  other
      applicants in his circumstances were interviewed. The result was  that
      the applicant had not been  fairly  treated  nor  had  the  procedural
      protections which ought to have applied been available to him.

  36. The respondent had given no  weight  to  the  applicant's  actions  in
      January 2014 in correcting his under-declaration, over 2 years  before
      the  indefinite  leave  to  remain  application  was  made,  which  he
      contended pointed strongly away from dishonesty.  It was unclear what,
      if any, benefit he would have  accrued  in  the  long  run  by  under-
      declaring his income to HMRC.  The Upper Tribunal should not speculate
      as to what the applicant's reasons were, or his intention  to  achieve
      any benefit by his conduct.

  37. The applicant had disclosed the  error  and  its  resolution,  in  his
      response to the questionnaire concerning his previous returns and HMRC
      had accepted his amendment.  It was speculative  to  assert  that  the
      much lower tax he was asked to pay should  have  triggered  a  concern
      that his income had been under-declared. Mistakes occurred and it  was
      not open to the respondent to assume that this error was intentionally
      or recklessly made.  No such inference could lawfully be drawn on  the
      material before the respondent.  The primary burden of  proof  was  on
      the respondent, and had not been  discharged  to  the  requisite  high
      standard of proof.

  38. The Secretary of State had not demonstrated that it  was  more  likely
      than not that the applicant had been dishonest in his  2010/2011  HMRC
      tax return.  The respondent could have  asked  HMRC  for  its  opinion
      thereon: there had been the opportunity  to  do  so.   The  respondent
      should not be allowed to rely on the discrepancy alone,  otherwise  no
      claim of this type could  ever  succeed  and  the  underlying  factual
      matrix for paragraph 322(5) would always be established by the fact of
      such a discrepancy.  The burden was upon the respondent  to  establish
      dishonesty and it had never been discharged.  The applicant relied  on
      AA  (Nigeria)  and  argued  that  it  was  unreasonable  to  deny  the
      applicant, who had corrected the error over 2 years before the present
      application, the further leave to remain he sought.  Mr Gill contended
      that the respondent's exercise of her discretion or failure to  do  so
      was unlawful and the decision should be quashed.

Respondent's summary grounds

  39. Mr Malik asked me to look at the acknowledgment of service, which  was
      in the papers before me.  I have done so.  The  respondent  noted  the
      explanation for the discrepant declarations, which was that the profit
      figure  had  been  miscalculated  by  his  previous  accountant.   The
      respondent argued that this was no explanation at all as  to  why  two
      entirely different figures were submitted, for the same year, to  UKVI
      and HMRC.  That was not indicative of a genuine calculation  error.  I
      note that, although the respondent did not rely on it in  the  refusal
      letter, it appears that the applicant still has not declared  to  HMRC
      the full amount of the self-employed earnings relied upon in his  UKVI
      applications.  Even having regard to the higher sum declared in  2014,
      there remains a difference of �7882 between the  total  income  relied
      upon in the UKVI application, and the 2014 HMRC declaration.

  40. The respondent had identified a clear discrepancy between  information
      on his income provided with the April 2011 Tier  1  (General)  Migrant
      application and to HMRC's records of  the  income  declared  for  that
      year.  The vast majority of the self-employed earnings  had  not  been
      declared, and the respondent was entitled to give weight to that.  The
      respondent was further entitled to  consider  that  the  2014  partial
      declaration of the missing amounts did not relieve her concerns  about
      the applicant's character or conduct.

  41. As regards the general  grounds,  AA  (Nigeria)  was  a  case  on  the
      application  of  sub-paragraphs  322(1A),  322(2)  or  322(2A).    The
      respondent had not refused under any  of  those  sub-paragraphs:   the
      provision in question here was sub-paragraph  322(5).   There  was  no
      need thereunder to evidence deception or dishonesty, nor was there any
      requirement for a person to have been convicted of a criminal  offence
      for paragraph 322(5) to apply.

  42. As regards  the  failure  to  allow  the  applicant  to  explain,  the
      applicant had been given that opportunity in the questionnaire and his
      response had been taken into account.  Paragraph 245AA (the evidential
      flexibility policy) was not  applicable  here  because  there  was  no
      missing  document;  rather,  the  applicant  had  provided   incorrect
      information to either or both of UKVI and HMRC. The  applicant  had  a
      duty to provide  all  relevant  information  and  documents  with  his
      application.  The decision the respondent made on  the  basis  of  the
      information provided was correct and lawful.

  43.  The  respondent  observed  that  this  was  not  an  Article  8  ECHR
      application but a points-based system application for Tier 1 (General)
      Migrant status.  The applicant could make an Article  8  claim  if  he
      chose to do so. There was very little Article 8 evidence here, nowhere
      near the standard required to substantiate a private and  family  life
      claim.

  44. I reserved my decision.

Discussion

  45. I begin by considering the human rights element  of  the  grounds  for
      review.  It is right to say  that  permission  was  neither  expressly
      granted, nor excluded, on  this  element  of  the  grounds,  and  that
      therefore, Mr Gill was entitled to argue all the grounds.

  46. However, the decision  under  challenge  arises  from  a  points-based
      system application.  There is presently no  human  rights  application
      before the respondent and it is not the function of the Upper Tribunal
      on  judicial  review  to  act  as  primary  decision  maker  in  those
      circumstances.  There is very little to support a human  rights  claim
      in the grounds or the evidence before the respondent  in  this  claim,
      but if the applicant does have a valid human rights claim, it  remains
      open to him to make it to the respondent, if so advised.

  47. Since the applicant has an alternative remedy on Article  8,  judicial
      review is not appropriate and I do not  need  to  consider  the  human
      rights claims in detail.

  48. I turn next to the substance of this claim, that the respondent  erred
      in the refusal decision and both administrative reviews by concluding,
      without interviewing the applicant  or  contacting  HMRC  for  further
      comment, that sub-paragraph 322(5) of the general grounds for  refusal
      applied to this claim, and  by  refusing  to  exercise  discretion  in
      favour of the applicant regarding the discrepancies in  his  UKVI  and
      HMRC submissions.

  49. The applicant asserts that he inadvertently under-declared  his  self-
      employed income for 2010-2011 and that  he  (at  least  partially,  it
      seems) corrected that under-declaration in January  2014.  It  appears
      that he also overdeclared his earned  income  (�6070.74  in  the  UKVI
      application and �9557 in the HMRC  application).   The  difference  of
      �3486.36 over-declared to HMRC for his earned income on that return is
      not sufficient to account for the under-declaration of  �35,077  self-
      employed income.

  50. It is right that the applicant made some acknowledgment of the  under-
      declaration  to  HMRC  on  4  April  2016  in  his  response  to   the
      questionnaire he completed when  attending  the  respondent's  Croydon
      office to  submit  his  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  indefinite  leave
      application.   The  explanation  given  in   his   response   to   the
      questionnaire, that 'the profit figure was miscalculated when  it  was
      first submitted' does not really explain why  the  applicant  did  not
      consider  that  a  tax  liability  for  his  self-employment  of  �555
      accurately reflected earnings of about �38,000.

  51. The letter from the accountants accepting responsibility takes matters
      no further:  the responsibility for accounting properly for income  is
      always that of the taxpayer and the difference here is  so  huge  that
      the respondent was unarguably entitled to consider that the  applicant
      could not have overlooked it innocently. Nor is it the case  that  the
      applicant derived no advantage from the errors:  there is an advantage
      in giving a high figure for the self-employed income to UKVI, since it
      makes a substantial difference to the points awarded and thus  to  the
      success of the applicant's 2011 application, on which, in part, his 5-
      year qualification period for the Tier 1 indefinite  leave  to  remain
      application was based.   Conversely,  the  under-declaration  to  HMRC
      significantly reduced the amount the applicant was liable  to  pay  in
      tax in 2011:  even if the full amount of tax due was later  paid  (and
      on these figures, that is not certain), the ability to  pay  tax  from
      2010 in 2014 is an obvious benefit to the applicant.

  52.  HMRC  has  a  discretion  to  decide  how  to  proceed  in  cases  of
      underpayment of tax, and  in  particular,  whether  to  prosecute  the
      offender or  to  recover  the  underpaid  tax  and  penalties  without
      commencing proceedings,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Taxes
      Management Act 1970.  HMRC exercised its discretion in the applicant's
      favour.

  53. The respondent has a separate discretion under  sub-paragraph  322(5).
      The exercise by HMRC of its discretion is not related to the  exercise
      of  the  respondent's  sub-paragraph  322(5)  discretion,  nor  is  it
      probative of the matters which the respondent must decide  thereunder.
      The respondent must make  her  own  decision  as  to  the  applicant's
      conduct and character, and  whether  to  exercise  discretion  in  his
      favour.

  54. The respondent's reasons for not  exercising  her  discretion  in  his
      favour are proper and lawful.  There is no public  law  error  in  the
      conclusions she  drew  from  the  evidence  before  her  and  she  was
      unarguably entitled to conclude that sub-paragraph 322(5) was relevant
      and that she 'should normally', and in this case should, refuse  leave
      to remain thereunder, pursuant to rule 245CD(b) of the Rules.

  55. I refuse judicial review of  the  respondent's  decision,  which  will
      stand.



Costs

  56. For the respondent, Mr Malik argues that as the successful  party  she
      is entitled to her costs of these proceedings, up to but not including
      the detailed grounds of defence and attendance at the  Upper  Tribunal
      hearing.  He contends that the respondent's non-compliance began on 11
      May 2017, and that she is entitled to her costs up  to  and  including
      that date, to be assessed if not agreed, or at least, to her costs  of
      the acknowledgment of service.

  57. For the applicant, Mr Gill argues that the respondent should  pay  the
      applicant's costs, or at least a high percentage thereof, because  the
      respondent's conduct has been unreasonable, for the reasons set out at
      [25]-[33]  above.  Absent  any  response  from  the  respondent,   the
      applicant was not able properly to prepare her case for  the  hearing,
      and until the respondent filed and served a request for  extension  of
      time on 28 July 2017, it was not clear that the respondent did  intend
      to participate in the proceedings.

  58. Alternatively, the applicant contends that there should  be  no  order
      for costs.

  59. I remind myself of the principle set out in Mount Cook Land Ltd & Anor
      v Westminster City Council [2003] EWCA Civ 1346 as to the approach  to
      costs in judicial review  proceedings.  The  respondent  is  certainly
      entitled to her costs of the acknowledgment of service. In addition, I
      am satisfied that it is right to award her the costs to which  she  is
      entitled as the successful party, but only up to and including 11  May
      2017. Thereafter, by reason of the respondent's breach of  directions,
      I make no order for inter partes costs.

Application for permission to appeal

  60. Mr Gill in an email received on Friday 25 August 2017 stated that  his
      instructing solicitors were taking instructions  on  whether  to  seek
      permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  He was  instructed  that
      any such application would be made by noon of the  day  preceding  the
      hearing.  No such application has been received.

  61. I have considered for myself whether  I  should  grant  permission  to
      appeal, pursuant to paragraph 44(4B) of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as amended).  I refuse permission, because I  am
      not satisfied that there is any arguable error of law in the  judgment
      I have given in this application.
