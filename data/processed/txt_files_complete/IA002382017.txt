                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Burnett, promulgated on 21 May 2019. Permission to appeal  was  granted
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt on 16 July 2019.



Anonymity

 2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason  for  one
    now

Background

 3. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on  25  October  2009  with
    leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General) migrant  under  the  Points  Based
    System, which was valid until 31 December 2011. On 31 December 2011, he
    made an invalid application for further leave to  remain  in  the  same
    capacity. That application was returned  to  him  on  24  January  2012
    because he had not completed  mandatory  sections  of  the  application
    form. On 3 February 2012, the appellant resubmitted his application for
    further leave. He varied that application on 2 July 2013 because he had
    finished his previous course and  wished  to  study  a  new  course  at
    Academy De London College.  The appellant's application of  3  February
    2012 was refused on 18 November 2013 because he submitted a false  bank
    statement as evidence of his financial support. The respondent informed
    the appellant that he had no right of appeal because his leave  expired
    on 31 December 2011  and  he  had  no  valid  leave  at  the  time  the
    application was made.

 4. The appellant nonetheless appealed the decision of  18  November  2013,
    claiming that his  appeal  be  treated  as  valid,  relying  on  Basnet
    (validity of application - respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113 (IAC).   In  a
    decision promulgated on 11 December 2014 (IA/50547/2013), a  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Drabu, allowed his appeal to the limited extent that the
    respondent consider new evidence provided by the appellant and  make  a
    fresh  decision.  There  was   no   apparent   consideration   of   the
    jurisdictional issue.

 5.  The  respondent  refused  to  favourably  reconsider  the  appellant's
    application, according to the decision letter dated  19  February  2016
    for the following reasons. It was alleged that for the purposes of  his
    application dated 31 December 2011, the appellant gave  a  fraudulently
    obtained TOEIC certificate from Educational Testing  Service  (ETS)  to
    his sponsor for them to provide him with a Confirmation  of  Acceptance
    for Studies (CAS). ETS informed the respondent that a proxy test  taker
    had been used and declared the  appellant's  test  to  be  invalid  and
    cancelled his scores. The application for further leave  was  therefore
    refused under paragraph 322(1A) of  the  Immigration  Rules  for  using
    deception in "this" application as well as 322(2) as it was  considered
    that the appellant's presence was not conducive  to  the  public  good.
    Furthermore, the respondent  noted  that  the  Academy  De  London  who
    assigned the CAS were not listed on the Tier 4 Sponsor Register when it
    was checked on 19 February 2016. No points were, therefore, awarded for
    attributes or funds because the appellant had failed to provide a valid
    CAS.  The respondent  also  refused  the  application  under  paragraph
    322(9) of the Rules because the appellant failed to  produce  documents
    requested by the respondent (by letter dated  8  December  2015)  which
    were submitted in advance of the appellant's hearing before the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 25 November 2014. The decision letter also stated that
    there was no right of appeal because the appellant's leave  expired  on
    31 December 2011.

 6. The appellant unsuccessfully sought to judicially review the  decision.
    In refusing the renewed permission application on 25 July  2017,  Upper
    Tribunal Judge King decided that it must have been the case that  Judge
    Drabu accepted jurisdiction in 2014 and therefore the appellant had  an
    alternative remedy of appealing to the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. In appealing to the First-tier Tribunal, the grounds of appeal asserted
    that the application made on 31 December  2011  was  "returned  by  the
    respondent for payment issue." The  grounds  also  contended  that  the
    appellant had not been given a period of 60-days to find a new  Tier  4
    sponsor  following  his  allowed  appeal,  with  reference   to   Patel
    (revocation of sponsor licence -  fairness)  India  [2011]  UKUT  00211
    (IAC), that he had received no  communications  from  the  Home  Office
    regarding providing his documents and that he had not used deception.

 8. Owing to  the  respondent's  contention  that  the  appellant  was  not
    entitled to appeal, the First-tier Tribunal considered the validity  of
    the  appeal  on  11  October  2017  and  directed  that  the  issue  of
    jurisdiction be considered as a preliminary issue at  the  appeal.  The
    directions stated as follows:

         "Following the  decision  in  Basnet  (validity  of  application  -
         respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113 (IAC) the onus of  proof  is  on  the
         Respondent to show that the correct fee was not paid."

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 9. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, it  was  argued  on  the
    respondent's behalf that  the  application  of  31  December  2011  was
    rejected because the appellant had not completed mandatory sections  of
    the application form. Reference was made  to  the  respondent's  letter
    dated 24 January 2012 which rejected that application as  invalid.  The
    judge considered that the issue of jurisdiction was not dealt  with  by
    the previous judge; that the previous application was  not  invalidated
    owing to  a  fee  issue  but  that  the  respondent's  conduct  assumed
    jurisdiction  at  the  2014  Tribunal  hearing.  The   judge   accepted
    jurisdiction and determined the issue of deception,  finding  that  the
    appellant was not a credible witness and that he had  not  provided  an
    innocent explanation in relation to the allegation of deception.

The grounds of appeal

10. The grounds of appeal argued that the judge took into consideration  an
    irrelevant matter,  namely  that  the  appellant  had  been  untruthful
    regarding the reasons his application was returned by the Secretary  of
    State. It was further argued that the judge applied a higher test  than
    the "minimum level of plausibility" referred to in SM and Qadir (ETS  -
    Evidence-Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00228 (IAC). The judge's  finding
    that the appellant wrongly stated the number of  people  who  took  the
    test was said to be unsound.  Otherwise,  it  was  submitted  that  the
    appellant had discharged the evidential burden upon him by providing an
    account of having sat the test without using a proxy.

11. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis sought. In addition,  the
    grant of permission stated that  "the  appellant  maintained  that  the
    issue was not raised with him adequately prior to the hearing."

12. The respondent did not file a Rule 24 response.

The hearing

13. Mr Gilbert relied on the grounds,  except  for  the  matter  of  proper
    notice of the letter of 24 January 2012 which he said did not form part
    of the grounds and was not  an  issue.  He  argued  that  the  Tribunal
    misdirected itself as to the law where an allegation of fraud was  made
    in the following manner. At the second  stage,  the  Tribunal  did  not
    assess  whether  the  evidence   satisfied   the   minimum   level   of
    plausibility, applying SM and  Qadir  v  SSHD  (ETS-Evidence-Burden  of
    Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC) at [67].

14. The appellant was not given the benefit of the third stage because  his
    prima facie innocent explanation was rejected. Mr Gilbert accepted that
    the respondent had discharged the initial burden. He asked me  to  note
    that the appellant sat two TOEIC tests and only the first was  said  to
    be fraudulent.

15. Mr Gilbert argued that the judge failed to  consider  relevant  matters
    which were in the  appellant's  favour  and  taken  into  consideration
    irrelevant matters such as the inconsistency in the  number  of  people
    who took the test on the day in question. The respondent's evidence was
    that over 100 people took the test that day, but the appellant did  not
    witness the whole day but just one batch and the  judge  did  not  take
    this evidence into account. Mr Gilbert further argued  that  the  Judge
    did not weigh or consider the appellant's evidence  other  than  noting
    that he needed the highest score possible. Nor did the judge note  that
    the appellant sat  both  tests.  Mr  Gilbert  questioned  that  if  the
    appellant was paying for one test which was invalid, why would he  take
    a second test  other  than  for  the  reason  he  gave.  This  was  not
    considered by the judge in assessing the appellant's conduct. The judge
    noted that the second test scores were much better than the first  ones
    and it was plausible that they were. With reference to MA (ETS -  TOEIC
    testing) [2016] UKUT 00450 (IAC) at [46-48], Mr Gilbert emphasised  the
    requirement  for  a  fact-sensitive  analysis  which  would  include  a
    consideration  of  the  account  of  attendance  and  whether  it   was
    plausible. While the judge  noted  that  70  per  cent  of  tests  were
    invalidated, he did not consider that 30 per cent  of  candidates  were
    genuine.

16. Mr Gilbert considered it doubtful that the return  of  the  appellant's
    previous application could materially affect the second stage  even  if
    untruthful regarding the reason for invalidation. He stressed  that  he
    was not saying that the judge not entitled to  take  this  matter  into
    account but that he was only required to do so at the third stage.

17. Ms Isherwood argued that there was no material  error  of  law  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal. Referring to the application form submitted by the
    appellant in February 2012,  Ms  Isherwood  made  the  point  that  the
    appellant could not claim to be unaware of the reason  his  application
    of 31 December 2011 was  invalidated  because  he  submitted  the  same
    passport in both applications. The same passport having  been  returned
    to him along with the letter of 24 January 2012 which indicated why his
    application was invalidated. Thus, the  appellant  had  full  knowledge
    that the invalidity was not due to a fee issue.

18. Ms Isherwood contended that the judge was correct at [10] to  note  the
    respondent's position that the appellant has had  no  leave  to  remain
    since 31 December 2011.

19. Ms Isherwood characterised Mr Gilbert's submissions as  a  disagreement
    with the weight which was placed on the appellant's evidence. She  drew
    my attention to [35] of the decision, where the judge  noted  that  the
    appellant could not now remember why his application was  invalid.  She
    argued that this issue went to  the  appellant's  credibility  and  the
    judge was entitled to assess the appellant's explanation and reject it.
    Regarding the second TOEIC test, this was also termed invalid.

20. In reply Mr Gilbert accepted that the appellant enclosed  the  passport
    which was returned to him with the letter of 24 January 2012  with  his
    subsequent application. He emphasised  that  the  appellant  could  not
    remember the basis of the refusal given the amount of  time  which  had
    elapsed and that the judge's reliance on this issue was unsustainable.

21. At the end of the hearing, I reserved my decision  as  to  whether  the
    First-tier Tribunal made a material error of law and  give  my  reasons
    below.  Mr  Gilbert  requested  that  the  judge's  findings  regarding
    jurisdiction be maintained.

Decision on error of law

22. It is not in dispute that the respondent  met  the  initial  evidential
    burden of raising a case that requires  the  applicant  to  provide  an
    innocent explanation. This raises a prima facie case of fraud.

23.  The  first  ground  of  challenge  was  that  the  judge   took   into
    consideration that the appellant had been untruthful in relation to the
    reason that his 2011 application was returned  and  that  this  was  an
    irrelevant matter in considering whether he had put forward an innocent
    explanation in response to the allegation of deception.

24. The correct approach to determining whether a person engaged  in  TOEIC
    fraud was set out in Majumder v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 1167:

         "...in considering an allegation of dishonesty the relevant factors
         included the following: what the person accused had  to  gain  from
         being dishonest; what he had to  lose;  what  is  known  about  his
         character; the cultural environment in which he operated;  how  the
         individual accused of dishonesty performed under cross-examination,
         and whether the Tribunal's  assessment  of  that  person's  English
         language proficiency is commensurate with his or her TOEIC  scores;
         and whether his or her academic achievements are such that  it  was
         unnecessary or illogical for them to have cheated."

25.  The  judge's  approach  to  the  consideration  of   the   appellant's
    explanation was in accordance with  what  was  said  in  Majumder.  The
    judge's findings on the deception issue are set out from [39]  to  [55]
    of his decision and include the following. At [43], the judge considers
    the appellant's oral evidence as  to  the  circumstances  in  which  he
    states  he  took  the  TOEIC  tests;  at  [44]  the  judge  lists   the
    appellant's, somewhat limited, academic achievements; at [45] the judge
    finds that the appellant demonstrated a "fair command" of  the  English
    language and accepted that he  had  shown  that  he  had  passed  other
    examinations at around the time of the TOEIC tests. In short, the judge
    took into consideration all the factors which worked in the appellant's
    favour.

26. As is apparent from the above extract from Majumder, what is  known  of
    an appellant's character is also a relevant factor. The  judge  rightly
    noted that in his 2018 witness statement (paragraph 4),  the  appellant
    maintained that the respondent returned the 2011  application  "due  to
    some payment issue." Indeed, the  appellant  has  been  vigorously  and
    continuously challenging the respondent's claim that his  leave  lapsed
    on 31 December 2011 since 2013, solely on the basis that the respondent
    failed to correctly take the fee. It was only once  the  appellant  was
    confronted  with  the  evidence  that  his  fee   was   refunded,   the
    respondent's letter of 24 January 2012 and GCID  entries  which  showed
    that the  application  was  invalidated  owing  to  several  incomplete
    sections of the application form that the appellant changed his account
    during the hearing, stating that he could not remember the  reason  for
    the rejection of his application and could not remember his  fee  being
    refunded.

27. At [46] the judge rejects the appellant's oral evidence and finds  that
    the appellant would have been aware of why his application was returned
    and his fee refunded. The judge's finding on  this  matter  establishes
    that the appellant has been dishonest regarding a matter other than the
    allegation of deception in question. This is clearly a relevant matter.



28.  The  appellant  has  been  making  dishonest  claims  about  the  2011
    application for over 5 years and  has  pursued  that  claim  previously
    before the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal in the form of  a
    judicial review claim. He has had  at  least  two  different  firms  of
    solicitors representing him during  that  time.  The  judge  was  fully
    entitled to reach the conclusion he did as well  as  to  find  that  it
    reflected adversely on the appellant's credibility.

29. The judge did not simply rely on the appellant's  dishonesty  regarding
    the returned application in rejecting his  explanation  but  considered
    other matters including that the appellant  had  done  very  little  to
    assert and prove  his  claimed  innocence[48-49],   that  even  if  the
    appellant did not need to cheat this did not mean that he had not  done
    so [52] and  that  a  Project  Fa�ade  inquiry  into  Synergy  Business
    College, London referred to evidence of widespread  cheating.  At  this
    point, it is worth mentioning that the Project Fa�ade  document  stated
    that during audits pilots were observed to be taking the test on behalf
    of candidates who were located in a separate room. Of 4894 tests  taken
    between 24 November 2011 and 15 January 2013, 2410 were invalid and the
    remainder questionable. The appellant says he took the test in question
    on 16 November 2011 and on that date 113 tests were taken with  79  (70
    per cent) being invalid and the remainder questionable.

30. It is argued that the judge was wrong to take  into  consideration  the
    appellant's evidence as to the number of people who took the test on 16
    November 2011. At [47] the judge noted that the appellant described 10-
    15 people taking the test and  compared  that  with  the  significantly
    larger number of tests taken referred to in the respondent's  evidence.
    Mr Gilbert  suggested  that  there  would  have  been  tests  taken  at
    different times of the day and the  appellant  could  have  no  way  of
    knowing how many people took their tests in an  entire  day.  At  first
    there appeared to  be  some  merit  in  that  submission,  however  the
    appellant's witness statement is clear in that the  following  is  said
    about the test  on  16  November  2011  at  paragraph  20  "there  were
    approximately 10 to 15 candidates taking the examination on that day at
    that centre." Furthermore, the ETS data does not  give  any  indication
    that there were varying test times on 16 November 2011, indeed the test
    time section is blank. In these  circumstances,  the  judge  cannot  be
    criticised for taking this discrepancy into consideration.

31. There is no basis for the submission that the judge  applied  a  higher
    test than the "minimum level of plausibility" referred  to  in  SM  and
    Qadir (ETS - Evidence-Burden of Proof) [2016]  UKUT  00228  (IAC).  The
    judge appropriately directed himself on  the  relevant  authorities  at
    [28] of his decision and a fair reading of his decision showed that  he
    applied those authorities to the case at hand.

32. The judge's conclusion that  the  appellant  failed  to  discharge  the
    evidential burden upon him by providing an innocent explanation to  the
    allegation of deception was wholly sound and was not vitiated by errors
    of law.



Conclusion

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld.
