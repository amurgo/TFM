A Tier 4 (General) Student application  can  be  varied  by  virtue  of  the
provisions  in  s.  3C(5)  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971.   There  is   no
restriction in s.3C(5) on the number of occasions on which application  for
variation of the  original  application  can  be  made  provided  notice  of
variation is given prior to the respondent's decision  as  thereafter  there
would then be no application pending.

As to the date the respondent is required  to  take  into  account  for  the
purposes of determining the points to be awarded  under  Appendix  C,  where
there has been a variation substituting a new college, it  is  the  date  of
the most recent variation for the purposes of paragraph 1A(c).


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


INTRODUCTION

1.      In this determination we shall continue to refer for  the  sake  of
    clarity to Miss Qureshi as the appellant although it is  the  Secretary
    of State being the appellant before us and the Secretary  of  State  as
    the respondent.  The  appellant  is  a  national  of  Pakistan  born  7
    September 1974 and she applied on an application dated  6  August  2010
    for further leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  a  student  under
    the Tier 4 points-based scheme to study at Empire College London at its
    Birmingham Campus.  Her course title  was  BTEC  Advanced  Professional
    Diploma in Management Studies.  It had started on 15 February 2010  and
    was due to end on 21 January 2011.  A Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies (CAS) document  was  submitted  on  the  letterhead  of  Empire
    College London dated 6 August 2010 together with evidence of statements
    of the appellant's accounts with HSBC for the period 28 June to 27 July
    2010.

2.      The appellant had previously been granted leave to enter the United
    Kingdom on 3 February 2008 as a student until 31 May 2009.  On 14  July
    2009 she was granted further leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student until 16 August 2010.  Empire College London lost  its  Tier  4
    (General) Student sponsor licence in September 2010.   The  reason  for
    this and the precise date are not known.

3.       On 15  December  2010  the  appellant  wrote  to  the  Home  Office
    explaining that her course at Empire College London was to  end  on  21
    January 2011.  She went on to explain:

         "I have been  accepted  on  a  new  course  of  MSc  Management  at
         Birmingham City University, due  to  start  in  January  2011.   My
         student CAS information for the new course and institution has been
         enclosed with this letter.


         Please include this with my Tier 4 application.  I look forward  to
         hearing from you and thank you."


4.      On 12 January 2011 the appellant wrote again to the Home Office  and
    we quote her letter in full:

         "I am writing with reference to  my  above  Tier  4  application  -
         further to my telephone conversation with Jannet, calling time  was
         12.10pm on 12-01-11.  Jannet advised me to  send  this  letter  via
         fax.  My current course for a BTEC Advanced Professional Diploma in
         Management Studies at Empire College of London (Birmingham  Branch)
         is due to finish on January 21st Jan 2011.  I send  my  application
         for Tier 4 in August 2010 and i am still waiting  for  my  response
         from you.  My course will be finished on 12-01-11 so  i  have  been
         enrolled and have been accepted on a new course of  MSc  Management
         at Birmingham City University which is  due  to  start  in  January
         2011.  I have already sent my details of admission and CAS No.  and
         details to the university on this address on this dt: 18-12-10.

         these details with my Tier 4 application.  I look  forward  to  any
         response."


5.      Up-to-date statements of the appellant's one account with HSBC  were
    sent to the respondent on 17 January 2011.

6.      A decision was quickly reached and on 20  January  the  Home  Office
    wrote to the appellant refusing the  application.   The  appellant  was
    awarded 30 points claimed for Attributes - Confirmation  of  acceptance
    for Studies (CAS) on this basis:

    .                "We  considered  your   CAS   from   Birmingham   City
        University, assigned on 10 December 2010


    .               Points awarded as claimed"

7.     No points were awarded  however  for  maintenance  (Funds)  for  the
    following reasons:

    .             "You claimed 10 points for possessing the required  funds
        to maintain and accommodate yourself  without  recourse  to  public
        funds and to pay  the  remainder  of  your  tuition  fees  for  the
        academic year.


    .             Your CAS from Birmingham City University states that you
        owe �5,750 in tuition fees.  You  also  require  �1,200  in  living
        funds; �6,950 overall.


    .             To support your claim you provided bank statements  from
        two HSBC accounts.


    .             The combined total of funds in the two accounts  on  the
        last date of the statement is �6,518.31.  This figure does not meet
        the maintenance requirement and no points have been awarded in this
        area, in line with published guidance."

8.      It was further explained in the letter of 20  January  that  it  had
    been decided to refuse the application for leave to remain as a Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant under paragraph 245ZX(d) of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

9.      The appellant appealed arguing that she was able  to  score  the  10
    points sought.  She also argued that the decision was contrary  to  the
    Human Rights Act 1998.  She also relied on a  Statement  of  Additional
    Grounds which added nothing new of substance to  the  somewhat  general
    grounds already stated.


THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL

10.    Immigration Judge J Macdonald heard the appeal on 24 March 2011  when
    the appellant was represented by Mr  Malik.   There  was,  however,  no
    representation for the respondent.  He had before him  a  statement  by
    the appellant confirming her immigration history and the  circumstances
    surrounding the  change  to  her  application  in  order  to  study  at
    Birmingham City University.  He also had  a  copy  of  the  appellant's
    letter of 12 January 2011 but did not have (as confirmed  by  Mr  Tufan
    before us) the earlier letter of 15 December 2010.

11.    Mr Malik argued that the Home Office had  been  correct  to  consider
    the appellant's position based on her proposed  studies  at  Birmingham
    City University but was wrong to say that the date of  the  application
    was 12 August 2010 as it was only on 12 January 2011 the appellant  had
    advised the respondent of her acceptance on the  new  course.   It  was
    further submitted that the appellant had a balance of over  �6,900  for
    the period 16 December until 13 January  2011  (the  Immigration  Judge
    working on the date of receipt), a period of 28 days and  so  succeeded
    under the Immigration Rules.

12.   In contrast with the more modest sums required  for  her  studies  at
    Empire College London, the fees for the course at Birmingham City  were
    to be �6,750 of which the appellant had paid a contribution  of  �1,000
    in cash on 9 December 2010.  The outstanding balance coupled  with  the
    same maintenance requirements meant that she needed to demonstrate  the
    availability of �6,950 to achieve the 10 points required  by  paragraph
    245ZX(d) read with Appendix C of the Rules.

13.   Observing that there  was  no  dispute  over  the  respondent  having
    considered the application on the basis of studies at  Birmingham  City
    University, the Immigration Judge went on to state his  conclusions  in
    these terms:

         "16.   A  question  then  arises  as  to  what  was  the  date   of
             application.  It seems to  me  that  the  Home  Office  had  a
             choice; they could have considered the application  under  the
             University she was actually studying  at  when  she  made  her
             application,  namely   Empire   College   or,   alternatively,
             considered it under the University at which she  is  presently
             studying which is what the Home Office did.  Mr Malik said the
             Home Office were entirely correct to do that as it would  have
             been  artificial  in  the  extreme  to  have  considered   her
             application under  Empire  College  when  she  was  no  longer
             studying there.


         17.    The issue is important as, putting it shortly, if  the  date
             of application is held to be 12th August 2010 the appellant is
             short of funds and if 12th January 2011  (or  more  accurately
             13th January 2011 allowing for the date of  posting)  she  had
             sufficient funds.  The case then turns  on  the  date  of  the
             application, it being said on the appellant's behalf that  the
             Home Office could not really have it both  ways  -  Birmingham
             City University was not mentioned  in  the  application  dated
             12th August 2010.


         18.    Does the date of application remain the same even  if  there
             has been a time gap  of  several  months,  the  appellant  has
             changed University and that change  forms  the  basis  of  the
             decision?


         19.    It seems to me that what the Home Office were doing  was  to
             rely on the information  contained  in  the  letter  from  the
             appellant dated 12th January 2011 which  identified  that  she
             was now studying at Birmingham City University  -  this  makes
             entire sense as without that letter the Home Office would  not
             have been able to say she  was  studying  at  Birmingham  City
             University.  It seems fair to conclude that  the  Home  Office
             therefore treated the application as being dated 12th  January
             2011 because they based their decision on  what  was  said  in
             that letter - at which time  the  appellant  was  studying  at
             Birmingham City University and not at Empire College London.


         20.    Absent  any  jurisprudential  authority  on  this  point  it
             therefore seems to me to be reasonable to conclude that  there
             was, as has been submitted, a fresh date of application.


         21.    On that basis, looking at the HSBC account, the original  of
             which was presented to me, it can be seen that  the  appellant
             did have a sum at credit in her account of �6,900 for  the  28
             days period.  That being so it follows that this  appeal  must
             be allowed and it  is  not  necessary  to  consider  questions
             arising out of the appellant's fundamental but qualified right
             under Article 8."

PERMISSION TO APPEAL

14.   The  respondent  was  not  content  with  that  decision  and   made
    application for permission to appeal which was granted by SIJ  Chalkley
    on 15 April 2011 in these brief terms:

         "I  believe  that  for  the  succinct  reasons  set  out   in   the
         respondent's application it is properly arguable  that  Immigration
         Judge J G Macdonald  may  have  materially  erred  in  law  in  the
         determination."


15.   The grounds of application (after setting  out  the  history  of  the
    application by the appellant) state:

         "The problem for the (now) respondent,  succinctly  stated  by  the
         Immigration Judge at his paragraph 17, was that, if her application
         was on 12th August, she was  short  of  funds,  but  seemingly  had
         enough money if her letter of 12th  January  was  held  to  be  her
         application.


         The Immigration Judge errs in regarding her letter of 12th  January
         as an application, rather  than  as  a  letter  supplying  updating
         information.  Having made an in-time  application  on  12th  August
         2010, thus triggering Section 3C, the applicant  was  prevented  by
         Section 3C(4) from lodging a further application: that paragraph is
         cited here:-


             '(4)    A person may not make an application for variation  of
                  his leave to enter or remain in the United  Kingdom  while
                  that leave is extended by virtue of this section'.


         Section 3C(5), however, goes on to  permit  the  very  action,  of
         variation, which the appellant took:-


             '(5)    But subsection (4) does not prevent the  variation  of
                  the application mentioned in subsection(1)(a)'.


         The  content  of  an  application  may  thus  be  varied,  but  the
         application means that which was lodged in-time.  The  Tribunal  is
         asked to agree that  the  Judge  made  a  material  error,  and  to
         substitute their own decision, dismissing the appeal."


 LEGAL FRAMEWORK

16.    We have already referred  above  to  the  relevant  Immigration  Rule
    (245ZX(d)).  To achieve the 10 points, for  Maintenance  the  appellant
    needed to meet certain of the requirements of Appendix C.  We quote the
    relevant extracts as at the date of decision,  various  changes  having
    taken place on 4 July 2011 (HC 1148):
        "1A. In all cases where an applicant is required to obtain points
        under Appendix C, the applicant must meet the requirements listed
        below:
        (a)     The applicant must have the funds specified in the relevant
             part of Appendix C at the date of the application;
        (b)     ...
        (c)     If the applicant is applying for entry clearance or leave
             to remain as a Tier 4 Migrant, the applicant must have had the
             funds referred to in (a) above for a consecutive 28 day period
             of time, ending no earlier than one calendar month before the
             date of application.
        (d)     If the funds were obtained when the applicant was in the UK
             the funds must have been obtained while the applicant had valid
             leave and was not acting in breach of any conditions attached
             to that leave.
         (e)    The applicant must provide the specified documents.
        (f)      ...".
17.    Although not relevant to this decision,  we  note  that  one  of  the
    changes implemented on 4 July 2011 is that the 28 day period is  to  be
    taken as the date of the closing balance on  the  most  recent  of  the
    specified documents and must be no earlier than 31 days before the date
    of application  and  so  removing  the  more  generous  28  day  period
    previously provided.

18.    As to the level of funds, the provisions of Appendix C  in  force  at
    the time of the decision had this to say:

        "Tier 4 (General) Students
         10.    A Tier 4 (Child) Student must score 10 points for funds.
         11.    10 points will only be awarded if the funds shown in the
             table below are available to the applicant and the applicant
             provides the specified documents to show this.  Notes to
             accompany the table appear below the table:
|Criterion                                    |Points     |

|(iii)   ...                                  |           |
|(iv)   Where the applicant has an established|           |
|presence studying in the United Kingdom, the |      10   |

|course fees required either for the remaining|           |

|part-way through, or for the next academic   |           |
|year if the applicant will continue or       |           |
|commence a new course at the start of the    |           |

|two months.                                  |           |


        Notes


        12.    ...


        13.    ...


        14.    An applicant will have an established presence studying in
             the United Kingdom if the applicant has completed a course that
             was at least six months long within the last period of leave as
             a Tier 4 Migrant, a student or as a Postgraduate Doctor or
             Dentist, and this course finished within the last ....."


19.    Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 is in these terms:

         "3C   Continuation of leave pending variation decision


             (1)     This section applies if -
                  (a)     a person who has limited leave to enter or  remain
                      in the United Kingdom applies  to  the  Secretary  of
                      State for variation of that leave,


                  (b)     the application for variation is made  before  the
                      leave expires, and


                  (c)     the leave  expires  without  the  application  for
                      variation having been decided.


             (2)     The leave is extended by virtue of this Section  during
                 any period when -


                  (a)     the application for variation is  neither  decided
                      nor withdrawn,

                      against the decision on the application for variation
                      (ignoring any possibility of an appeal  out  of  time
                      with permission), or


                  (c)      an  appeal  under  that  Section   against   that
                      decision, [brought while  the  appellant  is  in  the
                      United Kingdom,] as pending (within  the  meaning  of
                      Section 104 of that Act).


             (3)     Leave extended by virtue of the Section shall lapse if
                  the applicant leaves the United Kingdom.


             (4)     A person may not make an application for variation  of
                  his leave to enter or remain in the United  Kingdom  while
                  that leave is extended by virtue of this Section.


             (5)     But subsection (4) does not prevent the  variation  of
                  the application mentioned in subsection 1(a).


             (6)     ...".


20.    We turn to the Immigration Rules in particular  paragraph  34E  which
    provides:

        "34E. If a person wishes to vary the purpose of an  application  or
              claim for leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  an
              application form is  specified  for  such  new  purpose,  the
              variation must comply with the requirements of paragraph  34A
              (as they apply at the date the variation is made) as  if  the
              variation were a new application or claim, or  the  variation
              will be invalid and will not be considered.


        34F.     Any valid variation of a leave to remain application  will
              be decided in accordance with the immigration rules in  force
              at the date such variation is made."

21.   In summary  the  requirements  of  paragraph  34A  require  where  an
    application form IT is  specified  that  it  must  be  used.   It  also
    provides for payment of fees and other ancillary matters.




THE ISSUES BEFORE US

22.    It is not disputed that the appellant  made  an  in-time  application
    for the purpose of further studies in the United Kingdom which he  then
    sought subsequently to vary in anticipation of that course expiring  or
    coming to an end on  21  January  2011.   At  the  time  she  made  the
    application dated 12 August 2010, it was for an extension of  leave  to
    remain in order to study at Empire College London.  Can it be said that
    when she wrote to explain she wished to  vary  the  application  for  a
    degree course at Birmingham City University, she  was  applying  for  a
    different purpose?  This is not a point taken by the  respondent.   The
    second issue is what was the  relevant  date  of  application  for  the
    purposes of Appendix C.  The appellant gave notification of her changed
    plans on 15 December 2010 and again on 12 January 2011.  Which of those
    dates is the relevant one?   In  the  alternative  is  it  open  to  an
    applicant to vary an application more than once whilst  it  is  pending
    before the respondent?

SUBMISSIONS

23.    Mr Tufan explained he  relied  on  the  grounds  of  application  but
    disclosed the difficulty that he had not seen the bundle  of  documents
    before the Immigration  Judge  which  included  the  statement  by  the
    appellant as to the history of her dealings with the  Home  Office  and
    her letter of 12 January 2011.  In the course of searching  his  files,
    he came across the letter of 15 December  2010.   Mr  Tufan  maintained
    that  it  was  incumbent  upon  the  appellant   to   demonstrate   the
    availability of the specified funds as at 12 August being the  date  of
    the  appellant's  application.   The  appellant  therefore  needed   to
    demonstrate �1,200 plus �1,595 in respect of the unpaid course fees  at
    Empire College London.  He accepted that evidence before the respondent
    showed that  this  funding  requirement  had  been  met.   Despite  the
    acknowledged illogicality in this approach, even taking account of  the
    appellant's decision to pursue the more expensive course at  Birmingham
    City University, Mr Tufan maintained 12 August as  the  effective  date
    even though the appellant would not have known of the costs of the  new
    course then.

24.    We expressed our  concerns  to  Mr  Tufan  with  his  interpretation.
    Section 3C(5) permitted variation of an application and that  being  so
    if an applicant  wished  to  pursue  a  more  expensive  course  as  an
    alternative, it would be  odd  if  all  he/she  had  to  show  was  the
    availability  of  funds  for  the  less  expensive  course  for   which
    application had originally been made.  Mr Tufan, however, could not  be
    persuaded to resile from his stated position.

25.    Mr Malik made three submissions.  The first was  that  based  on  the
    authority in AQ (Pakistan) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 833 the Secretary  of
    State is recorded to have made a significant concession in these  terms
    at paragraph 22:

         "For the Secretary of State, Mr Payne accepts that,  following  AS,
         the relevant date for the assessment of evidence is the date of the
         Secretary of State's decision and not, as may  have  appeared  from
         earlier Tribunal decisions, the date of  the  application  to  her.
         The  application  is  treated  as  continuing  until  the  date  of
         decision.  It is further accepted that the response to an  OSW  may
         in some circumstances include additional support for  the  original
         application as well as fresh grounds of application.  Moreover, the
         purpose of the statutory procedure, as stated by  the  majority  in
         AS, is accepted and asserted."


26.    Mr Malik referred us also to the conclusions of Pill LJ at  paragraph
    35:

        "In my judgment, the decision of the  Tribunal  in  this  case  was
        correct.  A tribunal's task is to 'look back at the position as  at
        the date of application [now decision]' as stated by  the  Tribunal
        in the present case at paragraph 14 or, as the Tribunal put  it  in
        MS, at paragraph 49, in cases where 'the rule in question specifies
        a fixed historic time-line."


27.    Pill LJ continued at paragraph 36:

         "Section 85(2), put by the appellant at  the  heart  of  his  case,
         concludes by referring to the availability  of  grounds  of  appeal
         'against the decision appealed against'.  I  agree  with  Mr  Payne
         that the focus is on the decision of the Secretary of State.  In my
         judgment, the 'decision' is clearly the decision of  the  Secretary
         of State.  In the present context, fresh matters may be raised  but
         are relevant only insofar as  they  challenge  that  decision.   As
         Sedley LJ recognised in Pankina at  paragraph  39,  there  will  be
         cases under the Rules which depend on the situation existing at the
         time of the Secretary of State's decision.   In  my  judgment  Rule
         245Z is one of those cases.  The points to be accumulated  must  be
         accumulated at the time of the Secretary of State's decision.  That
         includes, as is agreed, a requirement that the relevant degree  has
         been awarded."


28.    We note that the issue before the Court of Appeal  in  AQ  (Pakistan)
    was whether the  points  entitlement  arising  from  a  Masters  Degree
    counted towards the minimum required if the degree  was  awarded  after
    the Secretary of State's  decision  but  before  the  decision  of  the
    Tribunal.

29.    Mr Malik's second submission was  that  the  proper  construction  of
    Appendix C read with s.3C(5) was that the relevant date  was  when  the
    application was varied.  It would otherwise lead  to  a  nonsense.   He
    drew the extreme contrast between  the  cost  of  a  course  for  which
    application had first been made of �500 which was then varied to an MBA
    degree costing �30,000.  He sought to  distinguish  the  letter  of  15
    December 2010 as a notice of intention by the appellant to vary  rather
    than a notice of variation itself even though we reminded him that  the
    appellant had submitted a CAS letter.  He took  instructions  from  the
    appellant and established as she had confirmed in her statement  before
    the Immigration Judge that the bank statements had been sent  with  the
    letter of 12 January.  He accepted that if the letter  of  15  December
    2010 was taken as the date of variation his client would be  unable  to
    succeed.

30.    His third submission was that if  we  concluded  12  August  was  the
    relevant  date  for  the  purposes  of  Appendix  3C  the   maintenance
    requirements had been met in the light of, the evidence acknowledged by
    Mr Tufan for her studies at Empire College London.  That being  so  any
    error by the Immigration Judge is not treating 12 August as the date of
    application was not material.

31.    By way of response, Mr Tufan  referred  us  to  paragraph  30  of  AQ
    (Pakistan) in which Pill LJ refers to the  decision  of  Sedley  LJ  in
    Pankina v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 719; [2010] Imm AR 689 at paragraph 39:

         "Although argument has been directed to large issues  of  principle
         arising out of the phraseology of the legislation, the  answer  has
         in my judgment to be found in the provisions themselves.  The  rule
         as framed makes it clear that it is to the  Home  Office  that  the
         necessary proof must be  submitted.   The  argument  that  a  fresh
         opportunity arises on appeal is based on s.85(4) of the  2002  Act,
         which provides that on such an appeal the  Tribunal  'may  consider
         evidence about any matter which it thinks relevant to the substance
         of the decision including evidence which concerns a matter  arising
         after the date of the decision'.  There are many instances of rule-
         based issues which need to be appraised as they stand at the moment
         of the appeal hearing, but the question whether at the date of  the
         application the specified funds had been in  the  applicant's  bank
         account for three continuous months cannot intelligibly be answered
         by evidence that they had not, albeit they now have been."


32.    In the  course  of  submissions  we  were  referred  to  the  further
    authorities in JH (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 78; [2009]  Imm  AR
    499 which refers to the Tribunal decision in DA (Section 3C  -  meaning
    and effect) Ghana [2007] UKAIT 00043.  With reference to that decision,
    Richards LJ observed at paragraph 31:

         "The Tribunal adopted a restrictive approach to what can count as a
         variation.  The appellant in that  case  had  applied,  during  the
         currency of his leave to remain as a student, for further leave  to
         remain as a  student.   That  application  was  refused.   He  then
         applied for leave  to  remain  as  the  unmarried  partner  of  the
         sponsor.  The Tribunal held, and was undoubtedly correct  to  hold,
         that the second application could not be a variation of  the  first
         because the first application had  already  been  decided  and  the
         appellant had therefore ceased to have a pending  application  that
         could be varied.  Its  first  reason  for  dismissing  the  appeal,
         however, was that the second application was not capable of being a
         variation  of  the  first  because  the  two  were   different   in
         character."


33.    Richards LJ found arguments before  him  that  DA  (Ghana)  had  been
    wrongly decided on its interpretation of variation within  s.3C(5)  and
    he concluded at paragraph 35:

         "The key to the matter is an understanding of how s.3C operates.  I
         have set the section out  at  paragraph  10  above.   That  section
         applies, by subs.(1), where an  application  for  variation  of  an
         existing leave is made before that leave expires (and provided that
         there has been no decision on that  application  before  the  leave
         expires).   In  that  event  there  is,  by  subs.(2)  a  statutory
         extension of the  original  leave  until  (a)  the  application  is
         decided or withdrawn, or (b) if the application  has  been  decided
         and there is a right of appeal against that decision, the time  for
         appealing has expired, or (c), if an appeal has been brought,  that
         appeal is pending: I paraphrase the statutory  language,  but  that
         seems to me to be the effect of  it.   During  the  period  of  the
         statutory extension of the original leave, by subs.(4)  no  further
         application for variation of that leave can be made.   Thus,  there
         can only be one application for variation of  the  original  leave,
         and there can be only one  decision  (and,  where  applicable,  one
         appeal).  The possibility  of  a  series  of  further  applications
         leading to  an  indefinite  extension  of  the  original  leave  is
         excluded.  However, by subs.(5) it is  possible  to  vary  the  one
         permitted application.  If it is  varied,  any  decision  (and  any
         further appeal) will relate to the application as varied.  But once
         a decision has been  made,  no  variation  to  the  application  is
         possible since there is nothing left to vary."


34.    The Court of Appeal in AS (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ  1076;
    [2010] Imm AR 284 referred to the consideration  by  the  court  in  JH
    (Zimbabwe) with this succinct summary by Arden LJ at paragraph 14:

         "This section was recently considered [in]  the  decision  of  this
         court in JH (Zimbabwe)....  The effect of s.3C is that  the  person
         with limited leave to remain can make an application for  variation
         of his leave before his leave expires.  If he does  so,  his  leave
         will be extended until that application is determined.  However, he
         can make no further application to  vary  his  leave  to  enter  or
         remain  until  that  happens:  he  may  only  apply  to  vary   the
         application that he has already made (s.3C(4)).  Richards LJ,  with
         whom Laws and Wall LJJ agreed, held in JH (Zimbabwe) that this  was
         true interpretation of s.3C and that its  purpose  was  to  prevent
         abuse of the  system  by  the  making  of  successive  applications
         'leading to  a  successive  extension  of  the  original  leave  to
         remain'."


CONCLUSIONS

35.    It was not a point argued before us however  we  are  satisfied  that
    the endeavours by the appellant to vary her application  were  for  the
    same purpose which was for  further  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom in  order  to  pursue  studies.   We  are  satisfied  that  the
    variation sought by the appellant was not therefore one caught  by  the
    provisions in paragraph 34E of the Rules.  In any event the conclusions
    of the Court of Appeal in JH  (Zimbabwe)  would  appear  to  limit  the
    opportunity to  variation  of  the  application  made  rather  than  an
    entirely new application for a different purpose.  That however is  not
    a matter of concern in the appeal before us.

36.    We are not persuaded by  Mr  Malik's  argument  that  the  concession
    recorded in AQ (Pakistan) has a material impact where as  in  the  case
    before us, the Immigration Rules specifically require an  applicant  to
    demonstrate a state of affairs or  circumstances  as  at  the  date  of
    application.  In contrast with Appendix C,  Appendix  A  (the  relevant
    provision at the time of decision) required:

         "(1)   An applicant applying for entry clearance or leave to remain
             as a Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  must  score  75  points  for
             attributes."


37.    There is no indication that the Attributes needed to be in  place  at
    the time of application.  Appendix C requires an applicant to show  the
    specified funds at the date of application.  It is this timeline  which
    no doubt Sedley LJ had in mind in Pankina.

38.    We are satisfied that a Tier 4 (General) Student application  can  be
    varied by  virtue  of  the  opportunity  in  s.  3C(5).   There  is  no
    restriction in s. 3C(5) to the number of occasions on which application
    for variation of the original application can be made  provided  notice
    of variation is given prior to the respondent's decision as  thereafter
    there would then be  no  application  pending.   As  to  the  date  the
    respondent is required  to  take  into  account  for  the  purposes  of
    determining the points to be awarded under Appendix C, where there  has
    been a variation substituting a new college, it is the date of the most
    recent variation for the purposes of paragraph 1A(c).

39.    It is significant that the respondent did  not  seek  to  reject  the
    appellant's application on the basis that she  no  longer  intended  to
    study at Empire College in London for which application had  been  made
    but to pursue a court at Birmingham City University.   Although  we  do
    not agree with Mr Malik that the appellant's letter of 15 December 2010
    was not notification of a variation of an application when  clearly  it
    was, it was nevertheless open  to  the  appellant  to  fine  tune  that
    variation by the submission of bank statements in  order  to  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix C on 12 January 2011.  The effective  date  of
    application for the purposes of calculation of the funding requirements
    therefore is 12 January 2011 in  the  case  before  us.   There  is  no
    dispute as acknowledged by Mr Tufan that the funds the appellant needed
    to show of �6,950 had been in her account for the  preceding  28  days,
    that is to say calculated from 16 December and including  the  date  of
    application.  The Immigration Judge referred  to  13  January,  however
    this was the date of receipt of application and not  the  relevant  one
    for the purposes of calculation of funds under Appendix C.

40.    Our conclusion therefore is that the Immigration Judge made no  error
    of law in allowing the appeal on the basis of 12 January being the date
    on which the appellant needed to demonstrate available funds  and  also
    the date by reference to the 28 day requirement.   The  appeal  by  the
    Secretary of State is dismissed and the  decision  of  the  Immigration
    Judge stands.
