Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr B Owusu
For the Respondent:    Mr G Jack, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen  of  Ghana  who  has  appealed  against  the
    Respondent's decision dated 17th March 2014 to refuse  his  application
    for a residence card as confirmation of a right to reside in the United
    Kingdom as the spouse of an EEA national.  The appeal  was  allowed  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Coutts on 23rd June 2014.

 2. The Appellant  claims  to  have  entered  the  United  Kingdom  with  a
    visitor's visa on 28th October 2006.  He overstayed and has remained in
    the United Kingdom ever since.  He claims to have met  the  Sponsor,  a
    German citizen, on 22nd September  2012  at  a  party.   The  Appellant
    claims that he and the Sponsor were married by proxy in Ghana  on  20th
    April 2013.  The parties were represented by their respective  fathers.
    At the date of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  the  Sponsor
    was 50 years of age and the Appellant 27.

 3. Having heard evidence from the Appellant and the  Sponsor,  the  First-
    tier Judge concluded that they were both credible  witnesses.   He  was
    satisfied that they had validly contracted a customary  marriage  under
    Ghanaian law which is recognised in the United  Kingdom.   Accordingly,
    the judge concluded that the Appellant was entitled to a residence card
    under Regulation 17 of the 2006 Regulations.

 4. The Respondent's representative applied for permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal and permission was granted on 9th July 2014.  The First-
    tier Judge who granted permission  considered  that  it  was  "strongly
    arguable" that the First-tier Tribunal misdirected itself at paragraphs
    14 and 16 of the  determination,  by  focusing  upon  the  question  of
    whether the Appellant's proxy marriage was recognised  by  the  law  of
    England and Wales rather than by the law of the EEA national's  country
    and domicile.  The judge considered that it was further arguable,  that
    insofar as the Tribunal allowed the appeal  on  the  alternative  basis
    that the Appellant was the extended member of an EEA national by reason
    of his durable relationship with that person, then it ought not to have
    allowed the appeal outright but ought instead to have left it  open  to
    the Respondent to exercise her discretion under Regulation 17(4).

 5. That is the background against which the matter came before me  in  the
    Upper Tribunal on 28th August 2014.  Representation  was  as  mentioned
    above.

 6. For the Respondent, Mr Jack adopted the grounds submitted in support of
    the application for permission to appeal.  The grounds submit that  the
    First-tier Judge materially erred  in  law  by  failing  to  take  into
    account the guidance given in Kareem (Proxy marriage - EU law)  Nigeria
    [2014] UKUT 24 (IAC).  The head note states the following:

         "In such an appeal, the starting point will be to decide whether  a
         marriage was contracted between the  Appellant  and  the  qualified
         person according to the national law of  the  EEA  country  of  the
         qualified person's nationality".

     It is further submitted that the First-tier Judge has  focused  on  the
    validity of the marriage under  UK  law.   Following  the  findings  of
    Kareem, it is submitted that the  judge  materially  erred  in  law  by
    failing to consider if the proxy marriage conducted  by  the  Appellant
    was valid in accordance with German law.

 7. The grounds further submit that the First-tier Judge failed  to  follow
    the guidance given in YB (EEA Regulation 17(4), proper approach)  Ivory
    Coast [2008] UKAIT 0062 upon  finding  that  the  Appellant  was  in  a
    durable relationship.  It is submitted that the judge should  not  have
    allowed the appeal outright under the 2006  Regulations  as  Regulation
    17(4) is a discretionary power of the Respondent.  This  had  not  been
    exercised as the Appellant's application was as a spouse and not as  an
    extended family member.   As  such  it  is  submitted  that  the  judge
    materially erred in law by allowing the appeal under  the  Regulations.
    It is submitted that it was only in the judge's power to find that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law  as  the  discretion  under
    Regulation 17(4) had not been exercised.

 8. For the Appellant, Mr Owusu accepted that he  could  not  realistically
    contradict the Respondent's submission  relating  to  the  exercise  of
    discretion under Regulation 17(4).

 9. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  in  allowing
    the appeal outright  in  a  situation  where  a  discretion  under  the
    Regulations had not been exercised.  That amounts to a  material  error
    of law as a result of which the decision falls to be set aside.

DECISION

The making of the decision by the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of a material error on a point of law.  I set  aside  that  decision  and  I
make a fresh decision to allow the appeal to the  limited  extent  that  the
Respondent's decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  remains
outstanding.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal (albeit to a limited  extent),  and  because  a
fee has been paid I have decided to make a whole fee award of ï¿½140.
