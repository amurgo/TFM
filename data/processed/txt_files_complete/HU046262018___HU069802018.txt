Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms H Aboni, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Parkin, counsel instructed by Rayan Adams
solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Claimants are nationals of Pakistan born  respectively  on  19  May
    1982 and 24 September 1990.  They are  a  married  couple.   The  First
    Claimant came to the UK on 22 September 2006 as a student with leave to
    remain.  He  subsequently  made  a  number  of   successful   in   time
    applications for leave as a student and  subsequently  with  regard  to
    Tier 1 of the PBS under the Immigration Rules.  His wife came to the UK
    on 11 December 2010 as his dependant and was granted leave in line with
    her husband.  They subsequently had two children, both born in the  UK,
    but neither of whom are qualifying children.

 2. The first Claimant made an in-time application for leave to remain as a
    Tier 1 (General) Migrant on 13  April  2016,  however  he  varied  this
    application on 1 September 2016 to an application pursuant to paragraph
    276B of the Immigration  Rules  on  the  basis  of  ten  years'  lawful
    residence.  This application was refused in a decision dated 30 January
    2018, on the basis that the Secretary of State considered it  would  be
    undesirable for the First Claimant to remain  in  the  UK  pursuant  to
    paragraph 322(5) of the Rules, because he had misrepresented his income
    to the Secretary of State and HMRC for the purpose of  either  reducing
    his tax bill or to obtain leave to remain.

 3. It was asserted that in his 2011 Tier 1 application, the first Claimant
    had declared earned income of �36,226.95 consisting of �10,698.95  PAYE
    income and �25,528.00 self-employed income. However, in his tax  return
    for 2010-2011 he declared �13,538.00 PAYE income and  �12,351.00  self-
    employed income.  The  First  Claimant  subsequently  amended  his  tax
    return through an  accountant  in  February  2016  where  he  showed  a
    declared income of �40,620.00 consisting of �15,092.00 PAYE income  and
    �25,528.00 self-employed income.

 4. The Claimants appealed, in time, and their appeals came before Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Shanahan for hearing in Nottingham on  25  July
    2018.  In a Decision and Reasons promulgated on  23  August  2018,  the
    judge allowed the appeal with reference to the Claimants' human rights.
     The judge was satisfied that the first Claimant had given  a  truthful
    explanation for the error in his 2010-2011 tax return and it was not  a
    deliberate or intentional misrepresentation to either the Respondent or
    HMRC.

 5. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that:-

      1) the judge had failed to give adequate reasons for his findings.  In
         particular why there would be two different sets of figures and  in
         failing to engage with the lacunae of evidence regarding  purported
         contact with the previous accountant who prepared the 2010-2011 tax
         return and the alleged refusal to  subsequently  assist  the  First
         Claimant. Reliance  was  placed  on  the  judgment  in  R  (on  the
         application of Khan) JR/3097/2017 as to the fact the First Claimant
         was blaming his accountant: see [33] to  [34]  of  Khan).   It  was
         asserted the judge had  not  given  anxious  scrutiny  to  all  the
         relevant factors;

      2) Ground 2 asserted that the judge had failed to  give  consideration
         to the fact that the corrected tax return still fails to match  the
         figures provided to the Secretary of State;

      3) Ground 3 asserted that the judge  relied  on  the  fact  the  First
         Claimant had not suffered any penalty  from  HMRC  to  support  the
         conclusion that his actions were not dishonest.  However, this does
         not demonstrate that HMRC were  aware  of  the  difference  in  the
         application made to the Home Office and  that  in  respect  of  his
         income declared to HMRC;

      4) Ground 4 provides:-

             "Lastly, the judge's consideration of the policy implies  that
             only  if  the  circumstances  identified  exist  that  general
             grounds of refusal would apply.   If  the  above  errors  were
             established, it is  argued  that  such  an  interpretation  is
             narrower than the  policy  provides  (see  13  to  16  of  the
             Decision and Reasons).  The circumstances identified  are  not
             an exhaustive list and can encompass other circumstances  such
             as the Appellant's".

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman  in  a
    decision dated 13 December 2018 on the basis that:-

         "The grounds, based  on  Khan,  Shahbaz  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,
         paragraph  322(5))  [2018]  UKUT  384  (IAC)  are  arguable.   That
         decision came out on 3 May, and the presenting officer should  have
         been in a position to refer the judge to  it,  though  it  was  not
         reported till later".

     Rule 24 response

 7. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, Mr Parkin sought to rely on a
    Rule 24 response.  He set out the head note  from  Khan  and  submitted
    that although the existence of a significant discrepancy in an historic
    tax return did entitle the  Respondent  to  reach  adverse  suitability
    findings,  it  was  plainly  open  to  an  applicant  to   rebut   that
    presumption.  He submitted that the task  for  the  Tribunal  following
    Khan was to consider the factors set out at [6] which the judge did  at
    [12]. [6] of Khan provides:-

         "There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary of  State  to
         consider in reaching her decision in  these  cases  including  (but
         these are by no means exclusive):

         (i)  whether the explanation for the error  by  the  accountant  is
             plausible;

         (ii) whether the documentation which can be assumed to  exist,  for
             example  correspondence  between   the   applicant   and   his
             accountant at the time of the tax return has been disclosed or
             there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;

         (iii)    why the applicant did not realise that an error  had  been
             made because his liability to pay tax was less than he  should
             have expected;

         (iv) whether at any stage the applicant has taken steps  to  remedy
             the situation and if so when those steps were  taken  and  the
             explanation for any significant delay ...

         (vii)    in relation to any of the above matters the  Secretary  of
             State is likely to want to see evidence which goes beyond mere
             assertion: for example in a case such as the present where the
             explanation is  the  applicant  was  distracted  by  his  son,
             concern for his son's  health,  there  should  be  documentary
             evidence about the matter.  If there is then the Secretary  of
             State would need to weigh up whether  such  concern  genuinely
             excuses or explains the failure to account for tax or at least
             displaces  the  inference  that   the   applicant   is   being
             deceitful/dishonest.  The Secretary of State before making her
             decision should call for  the  evidence  which  she  considers
             ought to exist and may draw an unfavourable inference from any
             failure on the part of the applicant to produce it."

 8. The Rule 24 response further asserted that the Tribunal found the First
    Claimant's explanation to  be  plausible,  including  consideration  of
    appropriate documentary evidence.  The Tribunal accepted  that  he  had
    been self-employed only briefly and thus less likely to  know  what  to
    expect in terms of taxation and had taken reasonably swift measures  to
    put the situation right.  It was submitted that this was very plainly a
    decision which was in accordance with the judgment in Khan, albeit  not
    referring  to  it  explicitly,  and  was  well-within  the   range   of
    conclusions open to the Tribunal.  It was asserted that the appeal  was
    no more than a mere disagreement with the  Tribunal's  conclusions  and
    permission to appeal ought not to have been granted.

     Hearing

 9. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, Ms Aboni sought  to  rely  on
    the grounds of appeal.  She submitted that the judge had failed to give
    adequate reasons for finding that there were no discrepancies, that  it
    was a matter of record that there were different figures and the  First
    Claimant gave no explanation as to how his  accountants  had  different
    figures and failed to establish how these came to be submitted.  Whilst
    an accountant may be blamed for an error in  a  declaration  the  first
    Claimant has failed  to  provide  any  evidence  of  contact  with  his
    previous accountants or obtain an  explanation  from  them  as  to  the
    discrepancies and has disregarded that fact when finding that the first
    Claimant has given a reasonable explanation.  She  submitted  that  the
    first Claimant would have been aware of the errors at an earlier  stage
    because he would have had a reduced tax liability.

10. I put to Ms Aboni the  recent  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673, as to whether or not this  altered  the
    Tribunal's  position  in  Khan.   She  submitted  that  this  did   not
    materially affect this decision in terms of procedural fairness as  the
    first Claimant had an appeal before the Tribunal and the opportunity to
    address the issues raised.  Ms Aboni maintained that the first Claimant
    had used dishonesty in one or  more  of  his  declarations.   Ms  Aboni
    further submitted that the judge relied on  the  fact  that  the  First
    Claimant had not been given a penalty by HMRC. However, the  fact  that
    there was no penalty did not demonstrate an awareness of  discrepancies
    between the information submitted to HMRC and  that  submitted  to  the
    Secretary of State, nor that his corrected figures did not  match  what
    he claimed in his Tier 1 claim to the Home Office.  She  submitted  the
    judge had failed to give adequate reasons for accepting that the  First
    Claimant had given an explanation that he did not  use  dishonesty  and
    the judge had erred in finding that  the  general  grounds  of  refusal
    should not apply to the First Claimant.  She asked  that  the  Decision
    and Reasons be set aside.

11. In his submissions, Mr Parkin asserted that the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal  was  without  merit  and  amounted  to  no  more  than  a  mere
    disagreement with the judge's reasoning.  He  sought  to  rely  on  the
    judge's  findings  at  [12]  where  he  gave  a  careful   and   cogent
    consideration to the points raised, including the fact that  the  First
    Claimant was self-employed for a very short period of time with a clear
    implication that he had a lack of experience in tax affairs.  Mr Parkin
    submitted there was evidence of bank statements showing payments to the
    second accountant to make good the tax liability.  The judge  found  it
    was plausible that the First Claimant did not go  back  and  check  his
    previous returns until he was applying for a  mortgage  in  2016.   The
    judge heard the First Claimant give evidence and made findings on  this
    evidence and was entitled to make those findings.

12. In respect of the  assertion  that  there  was  a  failure  to  provide
    evidence of contact with the accountant the judge dealt  with  this  at
    [8] of the decision and there was an e-mail from the  Claimant  to  the
    previous accountant at page 27 of the bundle and also a payment made to
    that accountant, Malik Farid, on 26  January  2012  as  per  the  First
    Claimant's Lloyds Bank statement at pages 28 and at 29; and a  copy  of
    an e-mail from the First Claimant to his first  accountant  asking  for
    the cause of the error in preparing his tax return on 25  January  2012
    for the year 2010 to 2011.

13. Mr Parkin submitted the judge was entitled  to  place  weight  on  this
    evidence.  In respect of the  discrepancy  in  the  figures,  this  was
    caused by the fact that the tax year runs from April to April and  thus
    the figures submitted to HMRC related to the twelve months, April  2010
    to April 2011, and was submitted in January 2012.  However, the Tier  1
    application relied on the First Claimant's income for the twelve months
    prior to that application being made, which was of course  a  different
    timeframe and thus inevitably the income would be different  from  that
    declared to HMRC in respect of the previous tax  years.   Consequently,
    Mr Parkin submitted that there was no actual discrepancy in the amended
    figures prepared by the First Claimant's  second  accountants  and  the
    Tribunal were bound to conclude that there was  no  inconsistency.   Mr
    Parkin submitted that at [8] the judge notes the evidence submitted  to
    that effect.  Mr Parkin further submitted that the case law  had  moved
    on since Khan.  In Balajigari one of the issues raised was the  failure
    by the Secretary of State to  undertake  or  make  specific  dishonesty
    findings, which was the position here where the Secretary of State  had
    simply noted there was a discrepancy rather than that it was dishonest.



14. In reply Ms Aboni asserted that the judge's  decision  was  very  short
    when one considers the issues involved.  His findings  amount  to  only
    one paragraph and that he did not engage with the evidence relied  upon
    by the Respondent adequately.

     Findings and Reasons

15. I reserved my decision, which I now give with my reasons.

16. The judge found as follows at [12]:-

         "I have very carefully considered all the evidence and  submissions
         in this appeal.  The Respondent has refused the  application  under
         paragraph 276B on the basis that the Appellant deceived either HMRC
         or the Secretary of State in relation to his  income  in  2011.   I
         have carefully considered the Appellant's explanation and  evidence
         related to this.  I take into account that he was self-employed for
         a very short period and ceased this at the end of the 2010/2011 tax
         year.  I take into account  that  he  had  paid  an  accountant  to
         complete tax returns and there is evidence in his  bank  statements
         of this payment.  While I accept it is the  responsibility  of  the
         individual to check  his  returns,  I  also  acknowledge  that  not
         everyone follows this procedure.  I also accept that having  ceased
         self-employment at the end of that tax  year  it  is  plausible  he
         would not have thought to go back and check  previous  returns.   I
         also accept that when he made the application  for  a  mortgage  in
         2016 he would have been required to provide  evidence  of  previous
         earnings and it was at that stage he realised  an  error  had  been
         made.  I note from the documentary evidence that  he  very  quickly
         instructed another accountant to sort out this error and  paid  the
         outstanding tax.  On balance I am satisfied that the Appellant  has
         given a truthful explanation for the error  in  his  2010/2011  tax
         return and it was not a deliberate or intentional misrepresentation
         to either the Respondent or HMRC."

17. The judge then directed himself in respect of paragraph 276B(ii)(c) and
    the Respondent's guidance in respect of Long  residence,  Version  15.0
    which he found at [16] did not apply and the Home  Office  guidance  in
    respect of paragraph 322(5), General grounds  for  refusal  Section  4,
    version 29, published on 11 January 2018 which he found at  [18]  would
    not cover the First Claimant's situation.

18. The judge concluded at [19]:-

         "Therefore having considered all the evidence I am  satisfied  that
         the Appellant would have met the requirements of paragraph 276B for
         indefinite leave to remain.  However as  this  is  a  human  rights
         appeal I must consider whether he would be entitled to leave  under
         Article 8.  There is no argument that he can succeed under Appendix
         FM as neither his wife nor children were British  citizens  or  had
         settled or protection status and the children were under the age of
         7 years.  There was also no argument under paragraph 276ADE."

19. The judge then directed himself in respect of  Article  8  and  Section
    117B and concluded at [23] there was no public interest in refusing his
    application for ILR and that the appeal  should  be  allowed  on  human
    rights grounds

20. I have, when considering whether or not the Judge made a material error
    of law, taken careful account of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in
    Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673, which was handed down on 16 April 2019.
    This concerned four linked  judicial  review  applications,  where  the
    underlying refusal by the Secretary of State had been made with  regard
    to  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  due   to   earnings
    discrepancies. The Court held at [92], [105]-[106] as follows:

         "92. The principal substantive consequence of our finding that  the
         refusal of T1GM ILR  on  paragraph  322  grounds  will  (typically)
         engage article 8 is that in any legal challenge the  tribunal  will
         be obliged to reach its own conclusion on whether the  interference
         is justified, rather than conducting a rationality  review:  as  to
         this, see para. 104 below. In an  earnings  discrepancy  case  that
         means, principally, that it will have to decide for itself  whether
         the  discrepancy  was  the  result  of  dishonest  conduct  by  the
         applicant in the supplying of figures to either HMRC  or  the  Home
         Office.'

         105. The tribunal, as well as the Secretary of State, of course has
         an obligation to act with procedural fairness. Where the  Secretary
         of State has alleged dishonesty, that  will  normally  require  the
         tribunal - whether the FTT on an appeal, or the UT on a  claim  for
         judicial review - to give the claimant  an  opportunity  to  adduce
         evidence in rebuttal; and, given that credibility will be in issue,
         that will normally include an opportunity  to  give  oral  evidence
         himself or herself  and/or  call  relevant  witnesses  (e.g.  their
         accountant) to give oral evidence.

         106. Each case will depend on its own facts, but, where an earnings
         discrepancy is relied on (and without changing the burden of proof,
         which remains on the Secretary of State so  far  as  an  allegation
         that an applicant was dishonest is concerned), it is unlikely  that
         a tribunal will be prepared to accept  a  mere  assertion  from  an
         applicant or their accountant that the discrepancy on was simply "a
         mistake" without a full and particularised explanation of what  the
         mistake was and how it arose."

21. Owing to the fact that the Claimants exercised their right of appeal on
    human rights grounds, the first Claimant had the  opportunity  to  give
    oral evidence and to adduce evidence in support of his claim  that  the
    discrepancy in his tax return as compared to his Tier 1 application was
    not the result of dishonesty. The evidence submitted in support of that
    contention included evidence that  the  first  Claimant  instructed  an
    accountant, Malik Fareed, to  prepare  his  January  2012  tax  return;
    payment to him for his service and an email  of  complaint  as  to  the
    cause of the error in the submitted tax  return:  pages  27-29  of  the
    bundle refer. The first Claimant then instructed a different accountant
    and submitted an amended tax return, which was accurate: pages 26,  30-
    42 refer.

22. I find that the First tier Tribunal Judge gave careful consideration to
    the oral evidence of the first Claimant and the supporting  documentary
    evidence and it was open to him to conclude as he did at [12]  that  he
    was satisfied "on balance" that the first Claimant had given a truthful
    explanation for the error in his 2010/2011 tax return and had not  made
    a deliberate or intentional misrepresentation to either the  Respondent
    or HMRC.

23. Applying the principles set out at [6] of Khan it  is  clear  that  the
    Judge: (i) accepted that the first Claimant's explanation for the error
    by  the  accountant  is   plausible;   (ii)   documentation   such   as
    correspondence between the applicant and his accountant at the time  of
    the tax return had been disclosed; (iii) the  first  Claimant  did  not
    realise that an error had been made because  he  had  never  previously
    been self-employed and it was only discovered when he decided to  apply
    for a mortgage in 2016; (iv) he then took steps to remedy the situation
    by instructing a different accountant and submitted a  new  tax  return
    and (v) provided evidence in support of his assertions. I further  find
    that the Judge's findings are in accordance with the guidance  provided
    by the Court of Appeal in Balajigari.

24. I have concluded that the grounds of appeal, in truth, do not amount to
    more than a disagreement with the Judge's findings of fact, which  were
    open to him on the evidence and with his reasons,  which  I  find  were
    adequate. In particular, at Ground 2, there  is  no  acknowledgment  or
    engagement in the grounds of appeal with the  fact  that  the  relevant
    time period for assessing the income for the first  Claimant's  Tier  1
    application [�36,226.95] is different from that  relating  to  his  tax
    year [�40,620] therefore, the  figures  will  not  match  because  they
