For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the appellant against a decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal issued on 28 November 2013 dismissing his appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision of 26 June 2012 to make a deportation order under
    the provisions of s.32(5) of the UK  Borders  Act  2007  following  the
    appellant's conviction on 28 February 2012 at Carlisle Crown  Court  of
    fraudulent embezzlement for which he was sentenced to 1 year 6  months'
    imprisonment. Permission  to  appeal  was  refused  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal but granted by the Upper Tribunal on 24 June 2014.

 2. On 13 August 2014 DUTJ Garratt found that the First-tier  Tribunal  had
    erred in law such that its decision should be re-made on  human  rights
    grounds only. His reasons were as follows:

         1.   On 24th June 2014 Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt gave permission to
         the appellant to appeal against the determination of Judge  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal Lobo in which he dismissed the  appeal  on  all
         grounds  against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  to   make   a
         deportation order against him on the basis that  Section  32(5)  of
         the UK Borders Act 2007 applied.

         2.   The grounds of application before the Upper Tribunal rely upon
         grounds submitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  seeking  permission.
         Three points are argued.  First, that the judge misdirected himself
         as it was not true to say that the appellant had been  deported  to
         the United States "a few years ago" when this was in fact  in  July
         2012.  Second, it is argued that  the  judge's  assessment  of  the
         Article 8 rights of the appellant's two  British  citizen  children
         was flawed because the principle of citizenship referred to  in  ZH
         (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC  was  not  applied  nor  were  their  best
         interests considered on the basis set out in LD (Article 8  -  best
         interests of child) Zimbabwe [2010] UKUT 298. The judge had wrongly
         considered his own test about whether or  not  the  children  would
         lose their British citizenship in going  to  America.   Third,  the
         judge did not attach appropriate weight to the  appellant's  wife's
         private life rights.

         3.   In granting permission  Judge  Pitt  noted  that  the  judge's
         decision depended upon whether the Nigerian mother of  the  British
         children would take them either to Nigeria or  the  United  States.
         Assessing the case against that factual  matrix  was  not  correct.
         She therefore thought it arguable that  the  judge  had  failed  to
         assess  the  correct  outcome  of  the  deportation  in  which  the
         appellant remained in the United States separated from his children
         who  would  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  their   mother.
         Nevertheless, Judge Pitt also pointed out that only a "very  strong
         case indeed" could succeed because of the decision of the Court  of
         Appeal in SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550.

         4.   At the  hearing  before  me  I  heard  submissions  from  both
         representatives.

         5.   Mr Hart confirmed reliance upon the grounds I have  summarised
         above.  He emphasised that the judge failed to  consider  that  the
         appellant would remain in the United States and his children in the
         United Kingdom rather than wrongly  identifying  (paragraph  26(o))
         the issue as the disadvantage which the children  would  suffer  if
         they moved to America.

         6.   Mr Hart also contended that the judge should  have  considered
         that the appellant had returned to the United States following  the
         issue  of  the  deportation  order  against  him  because  he   was
         influenced by UKBA officials to do so. He therefore opted  for  the
         Facilitated Return Scheme instead  of  appealing  the  respondent's
         decision which wrongly indicated that he did not have an in-country
         right of appeal.  In this respect Mr Hart drew my attention to  the
         appellant's  second  supplementary  bundle  in  which  there  is  a
         statement by the appellant  of  18  July  2013  explaining  why  he
         returned voluntarily to the  United  States  (paragraph  12).   The
         judge  did  not  appear  to   have   taken   this   evidence   into
         consideration.  He also argued that there was insufficient evidence
         for the judge to reject the private life claim.  Particularly since
         there was  evidence  that  the  appellant's  wife  was  engaged  in
         business.

         7.   Mr Kandola confirmed  that  the  respondent  relied  upon  the
         response although this was prepared without sight  of  the  initial
         grounds of application.  He argued that the determination  did  not
         show a material error because, even if the judge had given  further
         consideration to the best interests of the appellant's children, it
         would not have been unreasonable to expect them to leave the United
         Kingdom or for the judge to consider the  possibility  of  life  in
         America for the whole family.  He reminded  me  that  the  children
         were 4 and almost 2 years of age so could readily adapt.  He quoted
         Zambrano to emphasise that  neither  of  the  appellant's  children
         would be forced to leave the  United  Kingdom  where  their  mother
         remains.  On this basis the judge was not wrong to consider removal
         to America.

         8.   In conclusion Mr Hart emphasised the  decision  of  the  Upper
         Tribunal in Sanade  and  Others  (British  children  -  Zambrano  -
         Dereci) [2012] UKUT 0048 (IAC)  emphasising  that  the  appellant's
         wife had not thought of going to the United States.  On this  basis
         an incorrect proportionality assessment had been made.

         9.   Mr Hart also added that, if  I  ordered  a  re-making  of  the
         determination, it would be necessary to adjourn the appeal as  some
         of the witnesses to be called were presently in Nigeria.

         Conclusions

         10.  Paragraph 25(e) of the determination suggests that  the  judge
         believed that the appellant only had a right of appeal from outside
         the United Kingdom  in  respect  of  the  respondent's  deportation
         decision.  He does not  comment  on  the  fact  that  the  decision
         appealed against, namely that Section 32(5) of the UK  Borders  Act
         2007 applied, should have given the appellant an  in-country  right
         of appeal but wrongly stated that such  an  appeal  could  only  be
         exercised from outside the United Kingdom.  That error coupled with
         the content of the appellant's statement in relation to his  reason
         for returning to the United States should have been the subject  of
         consideration  by  the  judge  before   reaching   the   conclusion
         (paragraph 25(g)) that the appellant had made the decision  to  use
         the Facilitated Return Scheme to enable  him  to  maintain  contact
         with his wife and family more easily.

         11.  Whilst that  error,  alone,  might  not  be  material  I  have
         concluded that the judge's approach to proportionality  issues  was
         also flawed.  The judge's  consideration  of  human  rights  issues
         should  have  been  guided  by  paragraphs  398  and  399  of   the
         Immigration Rules taking into consideration the best  interests  of
         his  British  children.   In  paragraph  26(o)  the   judge   gives
         consideration to the  potential  loss  by  the  children  of  their
         British citizenship if they relocate to America yet this was not an
         issue before him nor does there appear  to  be  any  evidence  upon
         which he based his conclusion that the children would not be  at  a
         disadvantage if they moved to America.  The  judge's  consideration
         of the Article 8 family life issues  relating  to  the  appellant's
         wife and children is therefore flawed because he failed to consider
         the "exceptional circumstances" test set out in  paragraph  398  of
         the Immigration Rules and it cannot be said that his  determination
         was otherwise comprehensive enough  for  such  an  omission  to  be
         immaterial.

         12.  The determination shows material errors on a point of  law  in
         relation  to  the  Article  8  claim   and   should   be   re-made.
         Nevertheless, representatives are reminded of the comment  set  out
         in the grant of permission by the Upper Tribunal that, in  applying
         SS (Nigeria), only a "very strong case indeed" can succeed.

         DECISION

         The determination of the First-tier Judge shows errors on points of
         law such that it should be re-made on human rights issues only.

         No anonymity direction is made."



 3. Directions were given for the re-making of  the  decision  and  it  was
    accordingly relisted on 24 October 2014.  Unfortunately  Judge  Garratt
    was not available to continue the hearing due  to  ill  health  and  in
    order to avoid unnecessary delay in re-making the decision, the parties
    agreed that a transfer order should be made so that the  hearing  could
    be completed.

 4. The appellant is a citizen of the United States born on 3 July 1980. He
    is of Nigerian origin. His wife is a citizen of Nigeria aged 33 at  the
    date of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal. She  has  lived  in
    the UK for 9 years since  she  was  24  having  originally  come  as  a
    student. She had indefinite leave  to  remain  and  in  June  2014  she
    acquired British citizenship. They have two children born on 10  August
    2009 and 25 January 2012 respectively who are both British citizens and
    they have lived all their lives in the UK. The appellant came to the UK
    in 2005. He and his wife married on 31 May 2008 and they lived together
    as a family prior to his conviction.

 5. The convictions were on four counts of fraud to a total value short  of
    �15,000. In his sentencing remarks the judge said:

         "You played your part in what was a sophisticated scam, whereby you
         arranged bookings in hotels around the country,  purporting  to  be
         somebody else, normally a Mr Richard Taylor, giving a false address
         and a variety of cloned payment cards. That was the first  step  in
         the fraud. The next was to arrange for a delivery of  good  quality
         wine from a local Majestic Wine Store to that hotel, and the  third
         stage was to arrange for couriers to go to the  hotel  and  collect
         the wine that had been innocently delivered, the bills for both the
         wine and the courier service being  again  paid  for  using  cloned
         credit cards. As soon as the fraud had worked, the booking and  the
         hotel would be cancelled. The wine, as has been established through
         careful investigation, was delivered to an address associated  with
         you. Just what you did with it remains  unclear,  but  this  was  a
         carefully planned and well executed operation. It is fortunate that
         it was caught at a relatively early stage,  and  that  the  overall
         figure that I am dealing with is little under �15,000, both  frauds
         successfully committed and attempted to be committed."

 6. The notice of decision and the deportation  order  indicates  that  the
    right of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  cannot  be  exercised  in-
    country. It was argued by Mr Hart that  that  was  in  fact  wrong  and
    explains why the appellant took advantage  of  the  facilitated  return
    scheme receiving �500  and  being  removed  under  that  scheme.  After
    removal he exercised his right of appeal  arguing  generally  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law, Home  Office  policy,  the
    immigration rules, was contrary to article 8 and more specifically that
    the respondent had failed to consider his family life in  the  UK  with
    his wife and  children  or  the  obstacles  that  prevented  them  from
    accompanying him to the United States. The grounds further  argue  that
    the fact that the appellant decided to return to the United  States  on
    early release should not prejudice his appeal as he  was  desperate  to
    get out of the confinements of prison.

The Evidence

 7. I heard oral evidence from the appellant's  wife  and  the  documentary
    evidence relied on is contained in four bundles, A, B, C and D.

Oral Evidence from the Appellant's Wife

 8. The appellant's wife confirmed the contents of  her  witness  statement
    dated 13 November 2012, 30 January 2013 and 18 July 2013 and said  that
    she had read and agreed with the appellant's statement  dated  18  July
    2013.

 9. She confirmed that she had an  appointment  for  counselling  from  her
    depression and had been prescribed Fluoxetin for depression and Codomal
    for tension headaches. She was now 12 weeks pregnant  and  her  husband
    was the father. Since her husband had been deported she had visited him
    on 3 occasions from December 2012 to January 2013 in Nigeria, in summer
    2013 from July to August in the United States and in summer  2014  when
    the family went to Nigeria when the appellant travelled there  for  his
    grandmother's funeral. She referred to the photographs  in  the  bundle
    from those trips. She also  referred  to  the  record  of  Skype  calls
    confirming that the appellant telephones and  speaks  to  the  children
    everyday both before they go to school and then before they go  to  bed
    at about 8-8.30pm. There was a  very  close  relationship  between  the
    children and their father. They missed him a lot and both wanted him to
    come back to the UK.

10. She confirmed that she became a British citizen in June this year.  She
    had come  to  this  country  in  September  2004  and  had  lived  here
    continuously. She referred to the evidence that their older  child  had
    been to nursery but had now moved on to school and  the  younger  child
    was now at the same nursery. She had come to the UK as  a  student  and
    had an MSc in computer  studies.  She  had  been  on  the  science  and
    engineering graduate scheme, had had leave under the HSM scheme for two
    years and then as a Tier 1 General Migrant. She had obtained indefinite
    leave to remain after working for five years.

11. Her husband come to the UK initially as a visitor, then  as  a  student
    and finally as her dependant from 2008. He had citizenship of both  the
    United States and Nigeria. She agreed that he had obtained  �500  under
    the Facilitated Return Scheme. He had been told he could apply for  the
    balance but he had not done so. He now worked at a  help  desk  with  a
    mobile phone network. He had a brother in the USA who lived in Atlanta.
    She was asked to consider what she would do if the  only  way  for  the
    family to be together was for her and the children to go to the  United
    States. She replied that she did not want to choose between her husband
    and going to the States; she did not know whether she would be able  to
    get work there.


Submissions

12. Mr Duffy submitted that the  appeal  should  be  considered  under  the
    current immigration rules  as  amended  and  taking  into  account  the
    principles set out in sections 117A-D of the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 following the amendments set  out  in  s19  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014. This was not a case  where  the  appellant  could
    meet the requirements of para 399(a) and in particular the  requirement
    to show undue harshness. He accepted  that  there  was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting family life but the reason for the current separation  arose
    from the fact that the appellant had committed a  crime  leading  to  a
    sentence of imprisonment. If the position was  looked  at  outside  the
    rules the public interest considerations in s117C needed  to  be  taken
    into account. The appellant could not meet either exceptions  1  or  2.
    When granting permission UTJ Pitt had referred to the Court  of  Appeal
    judgment in SS (Nigeria) v Secretary of State [2013] EWCA Civ 550  that
    only a "very strong case indeed" could  succeed  a  comment  echoed  by
    Judge Garratt in his decision. This appeal did not, so he argued,  fall
    into that category.

13. Mr Hart pointed out that this had not been a case  where  a  court  had
    recommended deportation  as  erroneously  recorded  on  the  notice  of
    decision and submitted that the appeal  should  be  approached  on  the
    basis that it was immaterial that the appellant was now in  the  United
    States. He had had an in-country right of appeal  but  had  decided  to
    take advantage of the facilitated return scheme not  appreciating  that
    he could have exercised his right of appeal in  country.  He  submitted
    that the fact that there were  two  British  citizen  children  was  an
    exceptional factor and that it would be unduly harsh for those children
    who had lived all their life in the UK and were settled here to have to
    move to the United States.

14. He further submitted that the appellant was entitled,  however,  to  be
    considered not only under the rules but also outside  the  rules  under
    the general jurisprudence relating to article 8. There were  mitigating
    factors in the pre-sentence report and the  appellant  had  received  a
    reduced sentence because of an early  plea.  These  factors  should  be
    weighed against the public interest in deportation. He referred to  and
    relied on ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 and LD (article 8, in events of a
    child) Zimbabwe [2010] UKUT 278. The rights of the appellant's wife and
    children had to be given full weight together with the private life  of
    his wife who had been here as a student. The  fact  that  she  was  now
    pregnant was also a strong factor. When these  issues  were  considered
    together, he submitted that this  was  a  case  where  deportation  was
    disproportionate.

Assessment of the Issues

15. It is common ground that the decision must be re-made on the  basis  of
    the current rules and the law as set out in the Immigration  Act  2014.
    Any doubts about that  have  been  resolved  by  the  Court  of  Appeal
    judgment in YM (Uganda) v Secretary  of  State  [2014]  EWCA  Civ.  The
    relevant deportation rules are set out in paras  398-399  of  HC395  as
    amended.

16. The judgments of the Court of Appeal in MF  (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of
    State [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and R (MM) v Secretary of State [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 985 have confirmed that  the  immigration  rules  are  intended  to
    provide a complete code for dealing with  Convention  rights  in  cases
    involving "foreign criminals". At [135] of R (MM) the Court said:

         "Where the relevant group of IRs [immigration  rules],  upon  their
         proper    construction provide a "complete code" when dealing  with
         a person's convention rights in the context of a particular  IR  or
         statutory provision, such as in the case  of  "foreign  criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with  that  code,  although  reference  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality exercise. But if the relevant group of IRs  is  not
         such a "complete code" then the proportionality test would be  more
         at large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and  UK  and  Strasbourg
         case law."


17. I must also  take  into  account  the  public  interest  considerations
    applicable in all cases set out in  s117B  and  more  particularly  the
    additional considerations  in  cases  involving  foreign  criminals  in
    s117C. These confirm that the deportation of foreign  criminals  is  in
    the public interest and the more serious the offence, the  greater  the
    public interest in deportation. It is then provided:

         "(3) In the case of  a  foreign  criminal  (C)  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 4 years or more the public
         interest requires his deportation unless exception 1 or exception 2
         applies.


          (4) Exception 1 applies where -(a) C has been lawfully resident in
         the United Kingdom for most of C's life,  (b)  C  is  socially  and
         culturally integrated in the United Kingdom, and (c) there would be
         very significant obstacles to C's integration into the  country  to
         which C is proposed to be deported.


          (5) Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh."


18. Mr Hart submitted and I accept that  I  should  not  draw  any  adverse
    inference from the  fact  that  appellant  has  been  removed  and  has
    exercised his right of appeal from abroad or that he made  use  of  the
    Facilitated Return Scheme. The position is  that  the  appellant  is  a
    citizen of the United States who lived in  the  United  Kingdom  for  7
    years from 2005 to 2012. Although he is of Nigerian  background  it  is
    clear from the information provided to the  Criminal  Case  Directorate
    that he was born in the United States  as  were  both  his  mother  and
    father. It is clear from these facts alone that he is  unable  to  meet
    the requirements of exception 1 at S117C (4).  In particular there  are
    no significant obstacles to his integration into the United States.

19. However, in relation to exception 2 it is equally clear that he  has  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with  his  wife  and  his
    children. I accept the evidence that his wife and children have visited
    him on three occasions since he was deported, twice in Nigeria and once
    in the United States. I also accept that he maintains  regular  contact
    by Skype speaking to his children twice a day. His wife is now pregnant
    following the most recent visit to Nigeria and she has  been  receiving
    treatment for  depression  and  tension  headaches.  The  children  are
    settled in school and at nursery. I  must  consider  where  their  best
    interests lie. It would be in their best interests  for  them  to  live
    with both their mother and  father  even  though  at  the  present  the
    relationship is being maintained  through  regular  contact  on  Skype.
    However,  the  test  under  statute  is  whether  the  effect  of   the
    appellant's deportation on his wife and children would be unduly harsh.

20. I am not satisfied that this test is met. No adequate reason  is  given
    why his wife and children would not be able to join him in  the  United
    States. There is no evidence of any legal obstacles to that  course  or
    to indicate that the children are not entitled to (even if they do  not
    already formally have) US citizenship. Under British law  there  is  no
    question of them losing their British citizenship if they move  to  the
    United States. When the appellant's wife was asked whether, if  it  was
    the only way for the family to be together, she would  be  prepared  to
    move to the United States, she replied that she did not want to  choose
    between her husband and going to the States and did  not  know  whether
    she would be able to get work.

21. Whilst I have every sympathy with the position she has found herself in
    following her husband's conviction, imprisonment and  deportation,  the
    evidence does not satisfy me that the effect of his deportation on  her
    or the children would be unduly harsh. It is clear from the appellant's
    own witness statement at [16] that he and his wife have chosen  not  to
    relocate their family to the United States which he describes as  being
    "the easy option" but the fact remains this is the choice that  he  and
    his wife have made. They have chosen that she and their children remain
    in the UK even though it would not be unduly harsh or even unreasonable
    for them to relocate in the United States. The appellant  is  therefore
    unable to meet the requirements of S117C (4) or  (5).   Similarly,  the
    appellant and his wife have made the choice  of  having  another  child
    knowing the risk of the appeal being unsuccessful and in  circumstances
    where the family could be together in the United States. This is a case
    where the public interest assessed in  accordance  with  the  statutory
    guidelines outweighs the interference  with  the  appellant's  and  his
    family's right to respect for their private and family life.

Decision

22. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and  the  decision  has  been  set
    aside. I  re-make  the  decision  by  dismissing  the  appeal  on  both
    immigration and human rights grounds against the decision to deport the
    appellant.
