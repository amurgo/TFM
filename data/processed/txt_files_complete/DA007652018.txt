                                     and

               the Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Not in attendance
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This decision follows the setting  aside  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision which allowed the  appellant's  appeal  on  12th  August  2019
    against the deportation order made by the Secretary of  State  on  27th
    November  2018  under  the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2016 ("the 2016 Regulations").  In the  same  decision  the
    Secretary of State also refused a human rights claim.  The Secretary of
    State appealed that First-tier Tribunal decision observing  that  there
    was a lack of evidence as to the length of residence in accordance with
    the 2016 Regulations and thus whether the enhanced protection  applied.
     An error of law was found because the judge legally erred in  applying
    the 'imperative  grounds'  test  under  the  2016  Regulations  without
    adequate analysis of the evidence.  There were no preserved findings.

 2. I note that the Secretary of State's deportation decision  of  November
    2018 was certified under regulation 33 but in view of  the  pursuit  of
    the appeal through the First-tier Tribunal and the  Upper  Tribunal,  I
    conclude that the Secretary of State has 'waived' that certification.

 3. Mr EKO failed to attend either the error of law hearing or the  resumed
    hearing before me.  On file were the notices  to  him  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal of the date, time and venue of the hearings on  20th  November
    2019 and 11th March 2020.  Indeed, the hearing of  20th  November  2019
    was adjourned to allow the appellant to attend the resumed hearing  and
    submit further evidence.    The court had also attempted to contact  Mr
    EKO on the day of the error  of  law  hearing  without  success.   With
    reference to the overriding  objective  under  The  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as  amended),  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    appellant has been  given  every  opportunity  to  attend  the  resumed
    hearing and failed to do so without explanation and it was fair and  in
    the interests of justice to proceed with the hearing and decision.

 4. As recorded in the error of law decision the appellant is a citizen  of
    Italy born in Modena on 21st March 1993.  He came to the UK as a  child
    with his mother in 2004.  She arrived on her  Ghanaian  passport  as  a
    visitor and the appellant was enrolled at Bishopsford Community  School
    at the age of 11 years.   He  was  at  school  for  five  years  before
    attending Nescot College where  he  studied  design  and  painting  and
    decorating and after that was in and out of work.  Sometimes he was  on
    JSA and sometimes he did agency work.   He  latterly  started  his  own
    business.  In his written appeal he stated that he had been in  the  UK
    for over fourteen years and had never been to Italy.  According to  his
    mother's written statement she and the  appellant  had  left  Italy  to
    escape an abusive relationship with  the  father.   Oral  evidence  was
    given before the First-tier Tribunal that the father came to the UK  "a
    few years after this" [their arrival] and the  appellant  remembered  a
    court ordered contact hearing.  There were very limited details.

 5. Mr EKO has been convicted of fifteen  offences  on  nine  occasions  as
    follows:-

      i. 4th October 2011 convicted of  theft  and  received  a  conditional
         discharge of twelve months.

     ii. On 2nd August 2012 convicted of being drunk and disorderly, failing
         to surrender and  breach  a  conditional  discharge  for  which  he
         received an attendance centre requirement of twenty hours.

    iii. On 25th November 2013 convicted of travelling on a railway  without
         paying a fare and fined.

     iv. On 14th October 2014 convicted  of  travelling  on  a  railway  and
         fined.

      v. On 19th October 2015 convicted  of  possessing  a  controlled  drug
         class B cannabis and received a conditional discharge.

     vi. On 8th July 2016 convicted of one count of possessing an  offensive
         weapon in a public place, received a community order and possessing
         a controlled class A drug cocaine, and received a  community  order
         and fined.

    vii. On 22nd September 2016 convicted of driving a motor vehicle with  a
         specified control drug above the specified  limit  and  received  a
         community order and driving a vehicle whilst uninsured and had  his
         driving licence endorsed.  He  was  also  convicted  of  possessing
         cannabis for which he received a community order.

   viii. On 12th October 2016 convicted of driving a motor  vehicle  with  a
         proportion of specified controlled drug above the  specified  limit
         and received a community order and disqualified  from  driving  for
         three years.

     ix. On 12th January 2017 convicted  of  possessing  a  controlled  drug
         class B cannabis and he received a fine.

 6. By the date of the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  August
    2019, the Police National Computer ("PNS") printout dated August  2019,
    showed the appellant had also been convicted of  a  further  and  tenth
    offence in March 2019 of driving a vehicle whilst uninsured  for  which
    he received a fine and endorsement on his driving licence.

 7. The Secretary of State in her decision specifically did not  accept  he
    had been resident in the United Kingdom in  accordance  with  the  2016
    Regulations for a continuous period of five years in  order  to  secure
    permanent residence.  Specifically, the appellant had  failed  to  show
    that his father was exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom  for
    a continuous period of five  years,  and  further  that  the  appellant
    himself had failed to  provide  evidence  of  his  claimed  periods  of
    education and employment.

    The hearing

 8. At the resumed hearing before me, Mr Tufan confirmed that there was  no
    evidence  that  the  appellant  had  been  removed  and  there  was  no
    notification that he had changed his address.  The appellant  benefited
    only from the lowest level of protection and albeit he had not received
    a custodial sentence he was a persistent offender.

 9. The first issue  is  whether  the  appellant's  presence  has  been  in
    accordance with the 2016 Regulations.

    Legal Framework

10. I have set out the relevant 2016 Regulations  and  underlined  specific
    parts applicable to the appellant.

11. Regulation 4 sets  out  the  provisions  in  relation  to  workers  and
    students as follows:

         4.-  "Worker", "self-employed person", "self-sufficient person" and
         "student"

             (1)  In these Regulations-

                  (a)  "worker" means a worker within the meaning of Article
                  45 of the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European
                  Union1;

                  (b)   "self-employed  person"  means  a  person   who   is
                  established in the  United  Kingdom  in  order  to  pursue
                  activity as a  self-employed  person  in  accordance  with
                  Article 49  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the
                  European Union2;

                  (c)  "self-sufficient person" means a person who has-

                      (i)  sufficient resources not to become a  burden  on
                      the social assistance system of  the  United  Kingdom
                      during the person's period of residence; and

                      (ii) comprehensive sickness insurance  cover  in  the
                      United Kingdom;

                  (d)  "student" means a person who-

                      (i)   is  enrolled,  for  the  principal  purpose  of
                      following a course  of  study  (including  vocational
                      training), at a public or private establishment which
                      is-

                           (aa) financed from public funds; or

                           (bb) otherwise recognised  by  the  Secretary  of
                           State  as  an  establishment   which   has   been
                           accredited for  the  purpose  of  providing  such
                           courses   or   training   within   the   law   or
                           administrative practice of the part of the United
                           Kingdom in which the establishment is located;

                      (ii) has comprehensive sickness  insurance  cover  in
                      the United Kingdom; and

                      (iii)    has assured the Secretary of State, by means
                      of a declaration, or by such equivalent means as  the
                      person may choose, that  the  person  has  sufficient
                      resources not  to  become  a  burden  on  the  social
                      assistance system of the United  Kingdom  during  the
                      person's intended period of residence.

             (2)  For  the  purposes  of  paragraphs  (3)  and  (4)  below,
             "relevant family member" means a  family  member  of  a  self-
             sufficient person or student who is  residing  in  the  United
             Kingdom and whose right to reside is dependent upon being  the
             family member of that student or self-sufficient person.

             (3)  In sub-paragraphs (1)(c) and (d)-

                  (a)  the requirement for  the  self-sufficient  person  or
                  student to have  sufficient  resources  not  to  become  a
                  burden on the  social  assistance  system  of  the  United
                  Kingdom during the intended period of  residence  is  only
                  satisfied if the resources available  to  the  student  or
                  self-sufficient person and any of  their  relevant  family
                  members are sufficient to avoid the self-sufficient person
                  or student and all  their  relevant  family  members  from
                  becoming such a burden; and

                  (b)  the requirement for the  student  or  self-sufficient
                  person to have comprehensive sickness insurance  cover  in
                  the United Kingdom is only satisfied if such cover extends
                  to cover both the student or  self-sufficient  person  and
                  all their relevant family members.

             (4)  In paragraph  (1)(c)  and  (d)  and  paragraph  (3),  the
             resources of the student or self-sufficient person and,  where
             applicable, any of their relevant family members,  are  to  be
             regarded as sufficient if-

                  (a)  they exceed the maximum level of resources  which  a
                  British citizen (including the resources of  the  British
                  citizen's family members)  may  possess  if  the  British
                  citizen is to become eligible for social assistance under
                  the United Kingdom benefit system; or

                  (b)  paragraph  (a)  does  not  apply  but,  taking  into
                  account  the  personal  circumstances   of   the   person
                  concerned  and,  where  applicable,  all  their  relevant
                  family members, it appears to the decision maker that the
                  resources of the person or persons  concerned  should  be
                  regarded as sufficient.

             (5)  For the purposes of regulation 16(2) (criteria for having
             a derivative right to reside), references in  this  regulation
             to "family members" includes a "primary carer" as  defined  in
             regulation 16(8).

12. Regulation 6 governs the provisions in relation to a "Qualified person"
    as follows:

         (1)  In these Regulations-

             "jobseeker" means an EEA national who satisfies conditions  A,
             B and, where relevant, C;

             "qualified person" means a person who is an EEA  national  and
             in the United Kingdom as-

                  (a)  a jobseeker;

                  (b)  a worker;

                  (c)  a self-employed person;

                  (d)  a self-sufficient person; or

                  (e)  a student;

             "relevant period" means-

                  (a)  in the case of a person retaining worker status under
                  paragraph (2)(b) [or  self-employed  person  status  under
                  paragraph (4)(b)]1, a continuous period of six months;

                  (b)  in the case  of  a  jobseeker,  91  days,  minus  the
                  cumulative total of  any  days  during  which  the  person
                  concerned previously  enjoyed  a  right  to  reside  as  a
                  jobseeker, not including any days prior  to  a  continuous
                  absence from the United Kingdom of at least 12 months.

         (2)  A person who is no longer working must continue to be  treated
         as a worker provided that the person-

             (a)  is temporarily unable to work as the result of an illness
             or accident;

             (b)  is in duly recorded involuntary unemployment after having
             been employed in the United Kingdom for  at  least  one  year,
             provided the person-

                  (i)  has registered  as  a  jobseeker  with  the  relevant

                  (i)  has registered  as  a  jobseeker  with  the  relevant
                  employment office; and

             paragraphs (b), (d) or (e)  of  the  definition  of  qualified
             person in paragraph (1) (disregarding any period during  which

             (c)).

         (6)  Condition B is that the person provides  evidence  of  seeking

             or 5(c)  a self-employed person under paragraph (4)(b);

         for longer than the relevant period  without  providing  compelling
         evidence of continuing to seek  employment  and  having  a  genuine
         chance of being engaged.

         (8)   Condition  C  applies  where  the   person   concerned   has,
         previously, enjoyed a right to reside under this  regulation  as  a
         result of satisfying conditions A and B or, as  the  case  may  be,
         conditions D and E -

             (a)  in the case of a person to whom paragraph (2)(b) or (c) [

             total,

         unless the person concerned has, since enjoying the above right  to

             (b)  condition B [ or, as the case may be, condition  E]8  has

 1. Under Regulation 14.-

         14. -    (1)  A qualified person  is  entitled  to  reside  in  the
             United Kingdom for as long as that person remains a  qualified

 2. Regulation 15 is headed "Right of permanent  residence"  and  provides,

                  period of five years;

                  (b)  a family member of an EEA national who is not an  EEA

             (a)  that person does not have or ceases to have  a  right  to
             reside under these Regulations;

             (b)  the Secretary of State  has  decided  that  the  person's
             removal is justified  on  grounds  of  public  policy,  public

14. Regulation 27 reads as follows:

         Decisions taken on grounds of public policy,  public  security  and
         public health

         27. -    (1)  In this regulation, a "relevant  decision"  means  an

             security or public health.

             (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken  to  serve  economic
             ends.

             (3)  A relevant decision may not be  taken  in  respect  of  a
             person with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15
             except  on  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  and   public
             security.

             (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

                  (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                  period of  at  least  ten  years  prior  to  the  relevant
                  decision; or

                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
                  is in the best  interests  of  the  person  concerned,  as
                  provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the  Child
                  adopted by the General Assembly of the United  Nations  on
                  20th November 1989 (17).

             (5)  The public policy and public security requirements of the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise  conferred
             by these Regulations  in  order  to  protect  the  fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision  is  taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-

                  (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                  proportionality;

                  (b)   the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                  personal conduct of the person concerned;

                  (c)  the personal conduct of the person must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision;

                  (f)  the decision may be taken  on  preventative  grounds,
                  even in the absence of  a  previous  criminal  conviction,
                  provided the grounds are specific to the person.

             (6)  Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
             public policy and public security  in  relation  to  a  person
             ("P") who is resident in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision
             maker must take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,
             state of health, family  and  economic  situation  of  P,  P's
             length of residence in the  United  Kingdom,  P's  social  and
             cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of
             P's links with P's country of origin.

             (7)  In the case of a relevant decision taken  on  grounds  of
             public health-

                  (a)  a disease that does not have  epidemic  potential  as
                  defined by the relevant instruments of  the  World  Health
                  Organisation or is not a disease listed in Schedule  1  to
                  the  Health  Protection  (Notification)  Regulations  2010
                  (18); or

                  (b)  if the person concerned is in the United Kingdom, any
                  disease occurring after the three month  period  beginning
                  on the date on which the  person  arrived  in  the  United
                  Kingdom, does not constitute grounds for the decision.

             (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether the  requirements
             of this regulation are met must (in particular) have regard to
             the considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations  of
             public policy, public security and the  fundamental  interests
             of society etc.)

    Analysis

15. The appellant had not shown that he had achieved  permanent  residence.
    He entered the UK when he was 11 years old.   He  produced  a  passport
    demonstrating he was an Italian national.  His  mother's  passport  and
    visit visa demonstrated that his mother had entered the UK in 2004 as a
    Ghanaian national with a visit visa valid from August  2004  to  August
    2006.  There is no evidence in the papers as to the whereabouts of  the
    father, said to be an Italian national, and whether he resided  in  the
    UK at all.  The statement of the mother confirmed that she and her  son
    the appellant relocated to the UK because of domestic violence and  the
    courts ordered the father not to 'come near us'.   She stated  she  was
    summonsed to the Family Court in Holborn but  the  only  record  is  an
    acknowledgment of a 'date of conciliation appointment' on 22nd November
    2006.  There is no indication of the parties, their location or whether
    this was instigated by representatives. There is no  confirmation  that
    the father was in the United  Kingdom  at  all  during  the  period  of
    residence of the appellant, rather the opposite  from  the  claim  that
    they had left the father to come to the UK  to  avoid,  understandably,
    his violence.

16. It is clear from the evidence provided and  the  school  documentation,
    that the appellant attended school in the UK from the age of  11  years
    onwards but under Regulation 4(1)(d)(ii) and (iii) he would be required
    to have comprehensive sickness insurance in the United  Kingdom  to  be
    deemed to be in the UK in his own right  and  in  order  to  reside  in
    accordance with the regulations.  He could not be construed as a family
    member of his father for whom there was no evidence of presence in  the
    UK. Thus, it cannot even be found  that  the  appellant  commenced  his
    studies as the family member  of  a  qualified  EEA  national  (ie  his
    father).   There  was  no  evidence  that  the  appellant  had   either
    sufficient resources - his mother was in the UK on  a  visit  visa  -or
    comprehensive sick insurance.

17. In order to determine the appellant's qualified status under  the  2016
    regulations his work record (or other qualifying status) needed  to  be
    considered under Regulation 6 reproduced above.  The appellant produced
    a tax calculation from HMRC dated 14th  December  2018  and  there  was
    evidence in the bundle that the appellant claimed Job Seekers Allowance
    ("JSA") in December 2012.

18. The tax records showed the following:

       . For the tax year 2013/2014 he claimed JSA between 18th January 2013
         to 22nd May 2013, was employed  between  23rd  May  2013  and  25th
         August 2013 earning �431 (nil tax paid) and claimed JSA between 3rd
         February 2014 and 14th May 2014.

       . For the tax year 2014 -2015 he claimed  JSA  between  3rd  February
         2014 and 14th May 2014 and again between  15th  May  2014  and  7th
         January 2015.  On 8th January 2015 to 14th January 2015 he  claimed
         Employment and Support Allowance from the Department  of  Work  and
         Pensions.

       . For the tax year 2015 to 2016 there was no record of employment and
         no record of being registered as a Jobseeker.

       . For the tax year 2016/2017 he is registered as being in  employment
         for approximately 4 � months between 12th  September  2016  to  6th
         January 2017 earning �2,930 paying �90.20 tax.

       . For the tax year 2017/2018 he was  employed  by  McDonalds  between
         15th February 2018 and 10th May 2018 earning �1,606 but  paying  no
         tax.  For the tax year 2018/2019 he is recorded as  being  employed
         by McDonalds between 15th February 2018 and 10th May 2018.

19. The appellant cannot comply with Regulation 6 in order to show  he  has
    resided in the UK in accordance with the Regulations  for  a  five-year
    period counting from his date of entry into the United Kingdom in order
    to qualify for permanent residence.    There is no  evidence  that  the
    appellant has worked for a period in excess of one year under  6(2)(b).
    From 2013 to 2016 he is recorded by HMRC as working for only 3 months.

20. Further to Regulation 6(2)(c), in 2014 he was on JSA for 10 months, and
    under Regulation 6(3) he cannot retain worker status for more than  six
    months.  In order to comply with regulation 6(2)(c) he must also fulfil
    Conditions A and B.  He cannot comply with Condition A under regulation
    6(5)(b).  He could not show that he was present in the  United  Kingdom
    seeking employment, immediately after enjoying a right to reside  under
    [sub-paragraphs (b), (d) or (e) of the definition of qualified  person.
    There is no evidence of any employment or registration as  a  Jobseeker
    from 14th January 2015 to 12th September 2016 and only sporadic working
    from 2016 to 2018.    Until 12th September 2016 he had  one  period  of
    employment for three months in 2013.

21. There was minimal evidence of tax returns for the period  during  which
    the appellant now states he is self-employed, but I accept that he  was
    working for McDonald's in the tax year 2018/2019 because  of  the  HMRC
    documentation.

22. Owing to the record of being a worker  and  jobseeking,  the  applicant
    cannot show that he has secured five years continuous  residence  under
    regulation 15 of the 2016 regulations. Whilst at school and in  college
    in 2011, he has not shown he resided in accordance with the Regulations
    and for the reasons given above he has not fulfilled the  criteria  for
    being a qualified person for a period of five years.

23. The enhanced levels of protection under Regulation 27  will  depend  on
    whether the person has acquired a permanent right  of  residence.   The
    decision can only be taken on "serious grounds  of  public  policy  and
    public security" if that is the case.  As held in SSHD v Vomero  [2019]
    UKSC 35 to secure the enhanced and highest level of protection  against
    deportation on 'imperative grounds' the appellant needed  to  establish
    he had permanent residence.  I find that he has not achieved  permanent
    residence owing to  the  intermittent  nature  of  his  employment  and
    jobseeking  activity.   He  cannot  therefore  secure  the  ten   years
    residence for the reasons given above.  At no  point  since  his  entry
    until September 2016 had the appellant resided in the UK in  accordance
    with the regulations. Therefore, on the limited  evidence  provided  by
    the appellant he has secured  the  lowest  level  of  protection  under
    Regulations 23 and 27(5) of the 2016 regulations.

24. The Secretary of State maintained that the appellant was  a  persistent
    offender who fell within the criteria of Regulation 27(5) and  Schedule
    1 (a) (h) and (j) so that deportation was proportionate.

25. As set out in the  decision  to  deport,  and  highlighted  above,  the
    appellant he had been convicted 9  times  for  15  offences  between  a
    period of 4th October 2011 and 12th January 2017 including theft, being
    drunk and disorderly, possessing a controlled drug  class  B  cannabis,
    possessing an offensive weapon in a  public,  possessing  a  controlled
    drug class A drug cocaine, driving a motor  vehicle  whilst  under  the
    influence of a specified controlled drug and  using  a  vehicle  whilst
    uninsured.  He has been  further  convicted  in  2019.   The  appellant
    demonstrates a trend of re-offending.

26. Schedule 1 (3) of the 2016 regulations sets out that

         1. - ...

             (3). Where an EEA national or the  family  member  of  an  EEA
             national has received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent
             offender, the longer the sentence, or the  more  numerous  the
             convictions, the greater the likelihood that the  individual's
             continued presence in the United Kingdom represents a genuine,
             present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  of  the
             fundamental interests of society.

27. Schedule 1 of the 2016 Regulations provides a  non-exhaustive  list  of
    the fundamental interests of society in the UK.  From the nature of the
    appellant's offences, it is clear that they contravene the  fundamental
    interests of society specifically set out  in  Schedule  1  (7),  which
    include [and I have underlined the relevant provisions]

         (a)  preventing unlawful immigration and abuse of  the  immigration
         laws, and  maintaining  the  integrity  and  effectiveness  of  the
         immigration control system (including under these Regulations)  and
         of the Common Travel Area;

         (b)  maintaining public order;

         (c)  preventing social harm;

         (d)  preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;

         (e)  protecting public services;

         (f)  excluding or removing an EEA national or family member  of  an
         EEA national with a conviction (including where the conduct of that
         person is likely to cause, or has in fact caused,  public  offence)
         and maintaining public confidence in the ability  of  the  relevant
         authorities to take such action;

         (g)  tackling offences likely to cause harm  to  society  where  an
         immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify  but  where
         there is wider societal harm  (such  as  offences  related  to  the
         misuse of drugs or crime with a cross-border dimension as mentioned
         in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the  European
         Union);

         (h)  combating the effects of persistent offending (particularly in
         relation to offences, which if taken in isolation, may otherwise be
         unlikely to meet the requirements of regulation 27);

         (i)  protecting the rights and  freedoms  of  others,  particularly
         from exploitation and trafficking;

         (j)  protecting the public;

         (k)  acting in the best interests of a child (including where doing
         so entails refusing a child admission to  the  United  Kingdom,  or
         otherwise taking an EEA decision against a child);

         (l)  countering  terrorism  and  extremism  and  protecting  shared
         values.

28. The appellant has been convicted on 9 occasions for  15  offences  from
    the age of eighteen years  onwards,  and  had  failed  consistently  to
    consider the impact on society.  His  offences  include  theft,  and  a
    failure to  pay  fares  (repeated),  drug  use  and  possession  of  an
    offensive weapon (a baton).  In addition, the appellant has twice  been
    convicted of using a vehicle whilst uninsured but also, twice,  driving
    a vehicle with 'the proportion of specified controlled drug  above  the
    specified limit'.  Although not identifying an individual victim  these
    offences are detrimental to the welfare  of  society  as  a  whole  and
    undermine the fabric and resources of society.   Driving  whilst  under
    the influence of drugs can have serious implications for  the  personal
    safety of all road users and has the potential to  cause  very  serious
    personal injury and damage to members of the public.  The appellant has
    continued to offend from 2011  until  shortly  before  his  deportation
    order was signed in 2018 and has continued to offend subsequently.   He
    asserted in the papers and before the First-tier Tribunal that  he  has
    not offended more recently (since 2016) but even that does not indicate
    that he is not a persistent offender.   Furthermore,  the  updated  PNC
    printout dated 16th August 2019 clearly shows that  the  appellant  had
    yet another conviction on 25th March 2019 for driving a vehicle  whilst
    uninsured.  The appellant has repeated  the  same  offence  which  adds
    weight to the finding that he is a persistent offender  and  apparently
    without remorse.

29. I conclude that the appellant is a persistent offender and despite  his
    protestations  that  his  criminal  offending  ceased  in  2016   those
    representations were misleading to the First-tier Tribunal. Even  prior
    to that date he had a long history of offending, and  even  though  the
    offences did not attract a custodial sanction, as  seen  above  have  a
    wider societal impact.

30. The approach under the 2016  Regulations  to  persistent  offending  is
    clearly set out in Schedule 1 (7) (h) and although none of the offences
    as characterised by the sentence given might  in  themselves  meet  the
    requirements  of  Regulation  27,  the  cumulative  effect   does   so.
    Preventing social harm and protecting public  services  are  particular
    features of the fundamental interests of society and which in this case
    would prompt the removal of the appellant.

31.  A  letter  from  the  Offending  Manager  at  the   London   community
    Rehabilitation Company (Probation Service) confirmed on  21st  December
    2018 that the appellant had successfully completed his Community Orders
    with  Unpaid  work  following  various  offences  and  had  no  further
    interaction with the Probation Service since 1st November 2017 but  'at
    that time he was assessed as posing a medium risk of harm to the public
    (mainly due  to  the  nature  of  his  offence),  and  Medium  risk  of
    reoffending'.  The appellant at that time advised that he  had  'turned
    his life around.  He states that he now has a partner, he is  gainfully
    employed, and he and his partner are expecting their first child'.

32. The appellant was nonetheless considered by the  Offending  Manager  to
    remain a medium risk of re-offending and the  nature  of  the  offences
    committed are a threat to the fundamental interests of  society.   That
    the offences ranged for a period of 8 years, from the age of  18  years
    onwards, indicate that to date  the  risk  he  will  re-offend  remains
    present.

33. I find that the Secretary of State has discharged the burden of proving
    that the conduct of the appellant in all the circumstances represents a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society, taking into account his past conduct,
    as per Arranz (EEA Regulations - deportation - test)  [2017]  UKUT  294
    (IAC).

34. Regulation 27(5)(a), however, states that any decision  to  remove  the
    appellant must comply with the principle of proportionality and further
    the considerations under Regulation 27(6) must be taken into account.

35. The appellant is now 27 years old and he appears to be in good  health.
    There is no indication of any serious irreversible harm  should  he  be
    deported to Italy.

36. With regard to his family situation, he claims to be in  a  partnership
    with a British national and that his mother is resident in the UK.  His
    mother is said to have Indefinite Leave to Remain but  no  confirmation
    of this was produced.  She submitted a statement in support of her  son
    but there is  no  indication  that  they  live  together  or  there  is
    dependency or that his removal would in any way affect her  immigration
    status and that said, the relationship between mother and son was  said
    in the letter of his legal advisors dated 15th August 2017  now  to  be
    'strained'.

37. The appellant confirmed in the papers in his statement  (undated)  that
    he is in a relationship but, although he produced a  birth  certificate
    indicating that she was born in  Kent  England  in  1997,  he  has  not
    produced his partner's passport  to  confirm  her  status  as  being  a
    British citizen.  The estimated date of delivery of the child, of  whom
    he was said to be the father, was April 2019 but there was  no  further
    mention of the child in the papers save for the obstetric records.

38. I make an overall assessment of his integration in the  United  Kingdom
    and his links with Italy.  The appellant asserts he came to the  UK  in
    2004 and although disputed by the  Secretary  of  State,  the  evidence
    stemming from the school indicates that he attended there from the  age
    of 11 years and thus in 2004. There is a reference in June 2006 end  of
    year report that 'he has had another good year in Key  Stage  3'  which
    would suggest he commenced the academic year  of  September  2004.    I
    accept his first arrival in the UK is likely to have been at the age of
    11 and he attended  school  and  further  education  college  where  he
    obtained employment qualifications in painting and decorating.  I  have
    explored his employment record above and  note  that  there  have  been
    substantial periods of inactivity, particularly  between  14th  January
    2015 and 12th September 2016 when it is not even clear that he  was  in
    the UK.  The fact of his schooling and college education would  suggest
    that  the  appellant  has  secured  integration  but   his   subsequent
    offending.   The severing of integrative links depends upon an  overall
    assessment of the individual's situation at the time of  the  expulsion
    decision. The papers before me did not indicate any contribution to  UK
    society and limited evidence  of  his  current  relationship  with  his
    family in the UK and his partner.

39. Although he maintains that he is now self employed  and  produced  some
    expense receipts for his business named EKO Removals, there was nothing
    by way of accounts, bank statements or financial receipts to show  this
    company is trading and that the appellant could be classified as  self-
    employed and receiving income although I accepted he  was  working  for
    McDonald's in the tax year 2018/2019.

40. He also gave evidence in his statement  to  the  court  that  his  last
    conviction was in 2016. As seen above, the updated PNC dated 2019 shows
    the conviction  on  25th  March  2019  for  driving  a  vehicle  whilst
    uninsured. His statement on file may have been compiled  prior  to  his
    attendance at court but the evidence given at court was that his  'last
    offence was in 2016' and accords with the written statement and  denial
    of further offending.  That was incorrect and although I accept he  did
    not receive a  custodial  sentence  this  shows  that  the  appellant's
    offending has continued which undermines his integration.

41. The appellant gave evidence in the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  he  had
    lived in Italy to the age of 10 years and  thus,  although  denied,  he
    must have some understanding of the Italian language.  With regard  his
    employment he has produced evidence of  qualifications  on  decorating,
    gained whilst in the UK, and these skills could be deployed in Italy to
    support himself and any family who chooses to relocate there with  him.
    It is his assertion that he has no family or contacts in Italy but even
    if that is the case I find that as a young fit healthy adult with  work
    experience and marketable qualifications in  the  form  of  decorating,
    could adapt and forge a life in Italy where he spent the first 10 years
    of his life.

42. There is very limited evidence  (the  Offending  Manager  made  passing
    reference  to  a  rehabilitation  course)  that   he   has   undertaken
    rehabilitative work in the United Kingdom.  His mother and any  partner
    and possible child have not prevented him from continuing to offend.  I
    am not persuaded that his  deportation  to  Italy  will  prejudice  his
    rehabilitation or  that  he  needs  to  remain  in  the  UK  to  become
    rehabilitated.

43. Overall I conclude that for the reasons set out above and  in  view  of
    the genuine present and sufficiently serious threat the appellant poses
    to the fundamental interests of UK society, the removal is justified on
    the grounds of public  policy  and  security  and  proportionate  under
    Regulation 27.

44. I turn to a consideration of the issues under Article 8 of the European
    Convention on Human Rights and whether his deportation would breach the
    UK's obligations thereunder.

45. The Immigration Rules in relation to deportation do not apply  directly
    to EEA nationals but the position of the Secretary of State in relation
    to the article 8 claims of those faced  with  deportation  is  set  out
    under those rules.  Parliament's  view  of  what  the  public  interest
    entails is set out  at  sections  117A  to  117D  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Section 117D (2) (c)(iii) states that
    the definition of a 'foreign criminal' includes  persistent  offenders.
    The appellant is not subject to automatic deportation  because  he  has
    not been given a year's custodial sentence.

46. SC (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2018] EWCA  Civ  929  at  paragraph  24,  largely
    adopted and condoned the approach in Chege [2016] UKUT 00187  (IAC)  at
    paragraphs 53 and 54 with regard persistent offenders

         53.  Put simply, a "persistent offender" is someone  who  keeps  on
         breaking the law. That does not mean, however, that he has to  keep
         on offending until the date of the relevant decision  or  up  to  a
         certain time before it, or that the  continuity  of  the  offending
         cannot be broken. ...Someone can be fairly described  as  a  person
         who keeps breaking the law even if he is not  currently  offending.
         The question whether he fits that description will  depend  on  the
         overall picture and  pattern  of  his  offending  over  his  entire
         offending history up to that date. Each case will turn on  its  own
         facts.

         54.  Plainly, a persistent  offender  is  not  simply  someone  who
         offends more than once. There has to be repeat offending  but  that
         repetition,  in  and  of  itself,  will  not  be  enough  to   show
         persistence. There has to be a history of repeated criminal conduct
         carried out over a sufficiently long period to  indicate  that  the
         person concerned is someone who  keeps  on  re-offending.  However,
         determining whether the offending  is  persistent  is  not  just  a
         mathematical exercise. How long a period and how many offences will
         be enough will depend very much on the facts of the particular case
         and the nature and circumstances of  the  offending.  The  criminal
         offences need not be the same, or even of  the  same  character  as
         each other. Persistence may be shown by  the  fact  that  a  person
         keeps committing the same type of offence, but it  may  equally  be
         shown by the fact that he has committed a wide variety of different
         offences over a period of time."

47. I refer to my  findings  above  and,  on  that  basis,  find  he  is  a
    persistent offender.

48. Section 117C (3) to (5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    reflects  the  approach  to  foreign  criminals  including   persistent
    offenders and that the public interest requires deportation  unless  an
    exception applies or  there  are  very  compelling  circumstances.  The
    structured approach to the additional  considerations  in  relation  to
    article 8 are as follows

         117C  Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be  taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted.

49. Guidance as to  the  meaning  of  the  expression  "unduly  harsh"  was
    provided by the decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  KO  (Nigeria)  v
    Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2018]  UKSC  53;  and
    subsequent caselaw has emphasised that the focus on whether the effects
    would go beyond the degree of  harshness  which  would  necessarily  be
    involved for any child or partner of any foreign  criminal  faced  with
    deportation.  'Unduly harsh' sets a very high  bar.   For  an  offender
    sentenced to less than 4 years imprisonment, even if Exceptions 1 and 2
    cannot be satisfied, the offender may still avoid deportation if  there
    are "very compelling circumstances" within subsection (6)  above.   The
    latter is a stringent test, NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662.

50. Under Paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
         to the UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
         Convention, and

         ...

         (c)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good  and  they  are  a  persistent  offender  who  shows  a
         particular disregard  for  the  law,  the  Secretary  of  State  in
         assessing that claim will consider whether paragraph  399  or  399A
         applies and, if it does not, the  public  interest  in  deportation
         will only be outweighed by  other  factors  where  there  are  very
         compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those   described   in
         paragraphs 399 and 399A




         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
         if -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
         with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and

             (i)  the child is a British Citizen; or

             (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for  at  least
             the 7 years immediately preceding the date of the  immigration
             decision; and in either case

                  (a)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
                  country to which the person is to be deported; and

                  (b)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to  remain  in
                  the UK without the person who is to be deported; or

         (b)  the person has a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled in the
         UK, and

             (i)  the relationship was formed at a  time  when  the  person
             (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration status
             was not precarious; and

             (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in  the
             country to which the person is  to  be  deported,  because  of
             compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
             paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

             (iii)    it would be unduly harsh for that partner  to  remain
             in the UK without the person who is to be deported.

51. There were no details about the  partner  or  child  and  very  limited
    evidence as to any  family  life  with  a  partner.   Albeit  the  best
    interests of the child are a primary consideration and a best interests
    assessment should be made in the case of a child further to section  55
    of the Borders Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009,  there  was  no
    information about the child and I note  none  given  either  about  the
    partner or child before the First-tier Tribunal save  for  the  limited
    documents in the bundle including obstetric records, birth  certificate
    and provisional driving licence of the partner, and a  few  photographs
    of the appellant and his partner.   There  was  no  independent  social
    worker report or any medical evidence.  It is  relevant  to  note  that
    neither partner nor child would be required  to  relocate  outside  the
    European Union.   As a consequence, the appellant  does  not  meet  the
    requirements for the exceptions under Section 117C or  the  Immigration
    Rules (Paragraph 398 and 399)  with  which  the  statutory  test  under
    Section 117C should be read consistently.

52. Even if there is family life, which I do not accept on the evidence, it
    is accepted that deportation may have a detrimental  effect  on  family
    life but nonetheless may remain proportionate even  though  the  family
    may be broken up because of  the  appellant's  bad  behaviour:  it  is,
    however, the  consequence  of  deportation.   That  approach  has  been
    recently  reiterated  in  PJ  (Jamaica)  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  1213  which
    identified that the issue was whether there was evidence  on  which  it
    was properly open  to  the  judge  to  find  that  deportation  of  the
    appellant would result for the partner and/or the children in a  degree
    of harshness going beyond what would necessarily be  involved  for  any
    partner or child of a foreign criminal facing deportation. There is  no
    evidence here that it would be unduly harsh for the partner to live  in
    Italy or that it would be unduly harsh for the partner to remain in the
    UK without the appellant.

53. The appellant has lived for more than half his life in the UK (although
    there is no record of his residence in the UK for a significant  period
    between 2015 and 2016) and I accept that he came to the UK as  a  young
    child at the age of 11 years.

54. As held in the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  v  Kamara
    [2016] EWCA Civ 813K

         "... integration' calls for a broad evaluative judgment to be  made
         as to whether the individual will be enough of an insider in  terms
         of understanding how life in the society in that other  country  is
         carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so  as  to  have  a
         reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to  operate
         on a day-to-day basis in that society and  to  build  up  within  a
         reasonable time a variety of human relationships to give  substance
         to the individual's private or family life."

    On a broad evaluative assessment of his social and cultural integration
    into the UK I accept that his integration is suggested by his schooling
    and family in the UK but I refer to the findings above in  relation  to
    his work record and his contribution to society, both of which are of a
    limited nature.  I am not persuaded that latterly he  has  demonstrated
    social or cultural  integration  and  his  offending  appears  to  have
    undermined what integration there was formerly.

55. With reference to the Immigration Rules at paragraph 399A the appellant
    has not shown very significant obstacles to his removal to Italy.   His
    father is an Italian national and without  further  evidence  from  the
    appellant to the contrary, I consider it likely having lived there  for
    10 years as  a  child,  he  would  have  contacts  in  Italy  and  some
    understanding of the language. Even if he does not, I conclude that  he
    would be able to adapt to life there using the skills he  has  obtained
    in the UK.  From his school reports  he  demonstrated  an  aptitude  at
    school.

56. No compelling circumstances were evidenced and the decision  to  deport
    the  appellant  is,  in  my  view,  a  proportionate  response  to  his
    offending.  In order to outweigh the very significant public  interests
    in deporting him he would need to provide strong article 8  claim  over
    and above the circumstances described in the exceptions to deportation.
     That has not been done.

57. I thus dismiss the appellant's appeal under the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 and the Immigration Rules and on  human
    rights grounds.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
