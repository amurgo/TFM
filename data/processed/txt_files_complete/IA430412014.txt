Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant in this case who  was  born  on  20  January  1980  is  a
    national of Pakistan.  He has been in this country with valid leave  to
    remain as a student and prior to  the  expiry  of  his  last  leave  he
    applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under
    the points-based system.  In order to satisfy the requirements  of  the
    Rules it is necessary save in circumstances to which I will refer below
    to  send  all  the  information  required  under  the  Rules  with  the
    application.  It is common ground in this case that with regard to  two
    matters that information was not supplied with the application.  It  is
    also common ground that this was a genuine application  in  that  other
    than with regard to these two matters to which I will  refer,  all  the
    requirements under the Rules were satisfied.  The respondent  does  not
    dispute either that the requisite funds were in fact available or  that
    the applicant was carrying out a genuine business.

 2. The two matters where it is said the requirements  were  not  satisfied
    and indeed they were not, were first that the letter showing  that  the
    appellant had the requisite funds of ï¿½50,000 did not spell out in terms
    that those funds were for his own use and  were  not  for  the  use  of
    anybody else.

 3. The second matter was that the appellant did not  supply  the  specific
    information confirming the domain website  which  he  needed  to  show.
    There are however circumstances in which the strict requirements of the
    Rules can be waived by the respondent.  These were at the relevant time
    set out at paragraph 245AA of the Immigration  Rules  and  under  these
    provisions the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  or  Immigration  Officer  or
    Secretary of State has a discretion to contact  the  applicant  or  his
    representative, in writing, in order to request the correct  documents.
    This discretion is set out at subparagraph (b)(iv) of paragraph  245AA.
    It is stated within the Rules that "the  requested  documents  must  be
    received at the address specified in the request within  seven  working
    days of the date of the request".

 4. In accordance with this provision the respondent wrote to the appellant
    on 2 October 2014 pointing out that the information supplied  from  the
    bank did not state, as it needed to, that "the third party has informed
    the institution of the amount they intend to make  available  and  that
    the institution is not aware of the third party having promised to make
    the money available to another person".  The appellant was  accordingly
    given seven days in which to provide  this  information  in  accordance
    with the provisions within the Rules.  This letter was  posted  to  the
    appellant because the respondent was unable to contact the  application
    by email and following receipt of the letter the appellant notified the
    respondent that although he would attempt to get the information within
    the time given he may be in difficulty  doing  so  because  he  had  to
    obtain the information from the bank which was in  Pakistan  and  seven
    days was  simply  not  a  sufficient  period  of  time  in  which  this
    information could be obtained.  Thereafter, the appellant obtained  the
    information which had been requested from the bank which he sent to the
    respondent on 16 October 2014.  Unfortunately for him on the  same  day
    as he posted this information on to the respondent, the respondent made
    a decision refusing his application, the reasons given being first that
    the necessary information from the bank had not been supplied but  also
    that the  appellant  had  failed  to  submit  evidence  of  the  domain
    ownership for his website.

 5. The appellant appealed against this decision and his appeal  was  heard
    at Taylor House before First-tier Tribunal Callow on 20 May  2015.   At
    that hearing the respondent  was  not  represented  and  I  have  heard
    evidence of what is said to have occurred at that hearing  to  which  I
    will make reference below.

 6. Subsequently, in a Decision and Reasons promulgated  on  9  July  2015,
    Judge Callow dismissed the appellant's appeal.   He  does  not  in  his
    decision deal with whether or not the appellant could  or  should  have
    been given further time to provide the requisite documents  but  merely
    states that the Rules are mandatory and include  the  requirement  that
    the consideration of evidence under the points-based system is  limited
    to consideration of the evidence submitted with an application  and  as
    required information had not been supplied, his application had  to  be
    rejected.  As he says at paragraph 11, "the requirements of  the  Rules
    addressing  an  application  for  leave  to  remain   as   a   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) are expressed in  mandatory  terms;  they  preclude  the
    exercise of a discretion" and in this regard he relies on the  reported
    decision of this Tribunal in NA and Others (Tier 1  post-study  work  -
    funds) [2009] UKAIT 00025.  As he correctly states, "there is no  near-
    miss principle".  Accordingly, as the judge found at paragraph 12:

         "As the appellant did not  submit  the  bank  letter,  meeting  the
         requirements of the Rules, in time and has failed  to  furnish  any
         evidence of domain ownership for the website in question it has not
         been  demonstrated,  on  a  balance  of  probabilities,  that   the
         appellant meets the requirements of the Rules to be awarded  points
         under provision (d) in the first row of Table 4 of Appendix A".

 7. The appellant now appeals against this decision with leave having  been
    granted by First-tier Tribunal J M Holmes on 2 November 2015.   One  of
    the grounds of appeal is that the judge had indicated  at  the  hearing
    that he intended to allow the appeal and that the  judge  changing  his
    mind was a procedural error which in the words  of  Judge  Holmes  when
    setting out his reasons for  granting  permission  to  appeal  arguably
    "identify a significant procedural error that raises an arguable ground
    of fairness".

 8. I can dispose of this ground relatively speedily.  The evidence in  the
    statement provided by Mr Al Arayn is very brief and  merely  states  at
    paragraph 3 that, "towards the  end  of  the  hearing,  the  FTT  judge
    indicated that he is minded to allow the  appeal  after  reviewing  the
    papers".  The judge was not asked to comment upon what he says happened
    at the hearing but in any event I asked for Mr Arayn to attend which he
    did and in the course of his evidence  before  this  Tribunal  he  very
    fairly admitted that although the judge had said that he was minded  to
    allow the appeal he had also indicated that he needed to  go  over  the
    documents and in Mr Al Arayn's words "there was a 'but'."  The Court of
    Appeal in SK (Sri  Lanka)  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  495  has  indicated  when
    considering a similar submission that a judgment is not made until such
    time as it is promulgated and there  is  nothing  intrinsically  unfair
    about a judge who having taken further time to make up his  mind,  then
    alters his provisional view. In this case I would not go so far  as  to
    say that where a judge expresses in very strong terms  that  an  appeal
    will be allowed and then changes his or her  mind  without  giving  the
    parties an opportunity of making further  submissions  that  can  never
    amount to a procedural error but I am satisfied in this case that  that
    is not what happened.  The judge may have expressed a provisional  view
    of what he was likely to do but it is clear from the  evidence  I  have
    heard that that was not a definitive view and that the  decision  would
    be given finally following further consideration of the papers.

 9. The other matters that are argued relate though to the  fairness  of  a
    decision once discretion was exercised to  limit  it  in  a  way  which
    prevented compliance with what the appellant was required to  do.   The
    difficulty with this argument is of course  the  provision  within  the
    Rules at paragraph 245AA(b)(iv that the requested  documents  "must  be
    received at the address specified in the request within 7 working  days
    of the date of the request".  What  is  stated  in  the  letter  is  as
    follows:

         "You have 7 days from the date of this letter to provide the below,
         no further extensions will be provided.

         Documents required:

         (1)  The bank letter you have provided from United  bank  does  not
             state that the bank is unaware of the funds being available to
             anyone else."

10. The first observation that must be made about this request is that this
    letter is not in accordance with the law.  The requirement  within  the
    Rules is that the requested document  "must  be  received...  within  7
    working days of the date of the  request".   The  request  is  for  the
    document to be given within 7 days, which would include weekends and of
    course it is right that the appellant  in  fact  did  not  provide  the
    documents even within 7  working  days  but  in  a  case  where  strict
    reliance upon the Rules is said to be mandatory it is perhaps  arguable
    that at the very least the respondent should be punctilious in ensuring
    that the Rules are correctly stated.  Otherwise what is being exercised
    is not just a discretion under the Rules  but  a  rather  more  general
    discretion which the respondent would have in particular  circumstances
    where they are required.  I will deal with this aspect  of  the  appeal
    below.

11. Although the refusal letter relies on the failure to  provide  evidence
    of the domain ownership for the website  used  in  the  course  of  the
    appellant's business the point is made on behalf of the appellant  that
    this information was available openly to anyone  who  searched  for  it
    which in fact  is  not  disputed.   Ms  Isherwood  with  her  customary
    fairness has made the  Tribunal  aware  of  the  fact  that  there  was
    evidence on the respondent's file  that  as  at  16  October  2015  the
    respondent had, it appears,  carried  out  a  search  of  this  website
    because a document within her file establishes that.  It is also  right
    to say that the respondent does not seek  to  challenge  the  assertion
    that as a  matter  of  fact  that  information  has  subsequently  been
    supplied and would or could have been available at that time.  Although
    no specific admission is made that this is the case, in the absence  of
    a challenge, I so find on the balance of probabilities.

12. With regard to whether or not the First-tier Tribunal Judge should have
    found that that  information  had  in  fact  been  made  known  to  the
    respondent before the date of decision, I have in mind what is set  out
    at paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules which were in force at  the
    relevant time as they are now with regard to "documents  not  submitted
    with applications" and in particular to what is set  out  at  paragraph
    245AA(c) which is as follows:

         "(c) Documents will not be requested where a specified document has
             not  been  submitted  (for   example   an   English   language
             certificate is missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer,
             Immigration  Officer  or  the  Secretary  of  State  does  not
             anticipate that addressing the omission or error  referred  to
             in  subparagraph  (b)  will  lead  to  a  grant  because   the
             application will be refused for other reasons."

13. It is remarkable in this case if indeed the respondent had  not  before
    writing the letter of 2 October 2014  been  satisfied  that  there  was
    sufficient evidence of domain ownership  for  the  appellant's  website
    that she did not either in that letter request the appellant to provide
    that document or alternatively simply dismiss the  application  on  the
    basis  that  that  evidence  had  not  been   provided.    What   seems
    incompatible with the Rule in question is for the respondent  to  write
    requesting the information from the bank in circumstances where if  the
    second objection is sustainable the request for further  evidence  from
    the bank could not have led to a grant because  the  application  would
    have to be refused in  any  event  because  of  the  lack  of  evidence
    regarding domain ownership for the website.  In these  circumstances  I
    am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the  respondent  must
    have appreciated at the date the letter was sent to the respondent  and
    certainly as at the date of the decision that this  objection  was  not
    sustainable.  In these circumstances I consider  that  the  failure  of
    Judge Callow to consider whether this was so was in  the  circumstances
    of the case an error of law and for reasons  which  follow  a  material
    one.

14. That leaves the question of whether or not the letter which  ultimately
    was provided from the appellant's bank in  Pakistan  should  have  been
    taken into consideration.  It should be  pointed  out  that  again  the
    respondent does not challenge the genuineness of this letter or that as
    a matter  of  fact  had  the  letter  been  provided  either  with  the
    application or before the decision was made, it is more likely than not
    that this ground of rejection would not have been maintained.

15. The  appeal  was  brought  under  Section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as it was  in  force  at  the  date  of
    appeal.  This Act has now been amended but  as  at  the  relevant  time
    Section 82(1) provided that "where an immigration decision is  made  in
    respect of a person he may appeal to the Tribunal" and Section 84  sets
    out the grounds on which such an appeal must be brought.  These grounds
    include under Section 84(1)(f) "that the  person  taking  the  decision
    should have exercised differently a discretion conferred by Immigration
    Rules" and it is on this basis that the decision has to be  considered.



16. If one looks at what is stated within the  Immigration  Rules  it  does
    provide that the requested documents must be received within 7  working
    days of the date of the request.  In this case of course the  documents
    were not provided within 7 working days of the date of request  and  it
    is  a  finely  balanced  decision  as  to  whether  or  not  in   these
    circumstances a Tribunal is limited  simply  to  finding  that  as  the
    technical requirements of the Rules have not been met the appeal has to
    be refused.  In the particular circumstances of this  case  which  will
    not be repeated because the Rules have been changed and  are,  I  would
    expect, very unusual I do not consider that the Rules can  be  read  in
    such a narrow manner.  In the first place as I have already stated  the
    Rules do not provide for receipt within 7 days but 7 working days; also
    we cannot say with any certainty when the request was actually received
    and, thirdly, having decided to exercise her discretion, it  is  in  my
    judgment on the facts of  this  case  not  reasonable  to  expect  this
    appellant to  be  able  to  write  to  Pakistan,  get  the  information
    requested and then post it to the respondent so that it is received  in
    the relevant department within 7  days  of  the  date  the  request  is
    actually sent out.  That is so unreasonable as to be  unlawful  in  the
    circumstances of this case; the respondent having decided  to  exercise
    her discretion was obliged to allow the appellant a reasonable time  in
    which to provide  the  information  required,  and  the  judge  made  a
    material error of law by failing to consider this aspect  of  the  case
    such that his decision must be set aside and re-made.

17. I had before me all the evidence relevant to this  appeal  and  so  the
    only question which remains is whether I am limited to finding that the
    decision was not in accordance with the law, the consequence  of  which
    would be that the respondent would have to reconsider  the  application
    or whether I am able to say that the respondent should  have  exercised
    differently a discretion conferred by Immigration Rules in which case I
    can re-make the decision.

18. Having heard further submissions from the parties I consider that  this
    is one of those very rare cases where the Tribunal is able  to  re-make
    the decision on the basis that on the evidence available there is  only
    one way in which the discretion can be exercised.  Although  no  formal
    concession has been made with regard to the evidence from the  bank  (I
    have already decided that the evidence regarding the domain name was on
    the balance of probabilities before the respondent) no  suggestion  has
    been made that the letter is not genuine and as I have already  decided
    that the respondent was obliged to allow  the  appellant  a  reasonable
    time in which to provide the information which had been  requested  and
    as that information shows that other  than  with  regard  to  when  the
    information was supplied the mandatory  requirements  under  the  Rules
    were satisfied, it follows that  had  the  respondent  considered  this
    information properly as she should she would have been bound  to  grant
    leave as sought.
