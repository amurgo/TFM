Representation
For the appellant: Mr T Tabori of Counsel
For the respondent: Mr I Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of India born on and 19 January 1971 and 18
    October 1976 respectively.  They  have  a  child  together  who  is  in
    education in this country. They appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    against the decision of  the  respondent  who  refused  to  grant  them
    further leave to remain in the United Kingdom  under  paragraph  276ADE
    and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights.  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge Freer in a decision dated 2 July  2018  dismissed  their
    appeals.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by First--tier  Tribunal  Judge  SP  J
    Buchanan on 27 September 2018 stating that  it  is  arguable  that  the
    Judge's decision contained a material error of  law  because  he  found
    that the tests in section 117B (6)  [it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the United Kingdom]  and  paragraph  276  ADE
    (1)(vi) [very significant obstacles to the applicant  integration  into
    the other country] mirror one another.

 3. The Judge found that the  appellants  cannot  satisfy  the  Immigration
    Rules because they are  not  any  significant  obstacles  for  them  to
    reintegrate into India. He found that their child who has lived in  the
    United Kingdom for more than seven years  is  an  Indian  national  can
    adapt to life in India with his  parents.  He  found  that  the  second
    appellant earns ï¿½1906 per month in the  United  Kingdom  and  there  is
    nothing to suggest that she cannot find work in India  and  look  after
    their child.

 4. In respect of Article 8 the Judge found that the child is preparing  to
    enter grammar school and is clearly bright and hard-working.  He  found
    that the best interests of the child are to live with  his  parents  in
    India. The Judge found that the child is at an age where he is about to
    change school anyway so will make  new  school  friends  in  India.  He
    further found that the child can learn his language and  adapt  to  his
    culture in India. The Judge found that he does not regard  the  child's
    schooling in this country as "a tipping point" and that "it  is  not  a
    strongly pro-appellant point" but arguably more or less neutral one  at
    his age. He considered the case of is Azimi Moyed in  relation  to  the
    appellant's age and said that the best interests of the child  are  his
    primary consideration but not without more likely to be a determinative
    one. He advised himself that after seven years of residence by a child,
    there needs to be a strong counter reason to remove, if that is  to  be
    outweighed.

 5. The reasons that the Judge gave as counter reasons was that the child's
    parents who have lived in this country unlawfully for a very long  time
    did not renewing the "search for a college to study at the  level  that
    they need to allow that  to  occur".  He  said  that  this  immigration
    conduct by the parents strongly undermines  the  best  point  that  the
    appellants had. The Judge further found that if the child's parents had
    prospered here through work, they would have funds and therefore it  is
    not easy to explain why they waited so  long  to  reapply  for  further
    leave. The Judge considered that this conduct of the parents reinforces
    the powerful weight to be given to the respondent's duty  of  upholding
    immigration controls according to law. The  Judge  found  that  section
    117B mirrors section 276 ADE (1) (vi).

 6. It was made clear in MA  Pakistan  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705  the  parents
    conduct is only relevant under the proportionality assessment  and  not
    for  the  reasonableness  of  return  test.  Therefore,   the   Judge's
    reasonableness assessment under the  immigration  rules  is  materially
    defective.  There  was  insufficient  and  consideration  of  the  best
    interests of the qualifying child by the Judge in this case.

 7. The Judge did not consider that strong and powerful reasons are  needed
    to require a qualifying child to leave the United  Kingdom.  The  Judge
    placed too much weight on  the  gravity  of  the  appellant's  parent's
    adverse immigration conduct  and  not  whether  there  are  strong  and
    powerful reasons which was the correct test to apply.

 8. In considering this appeal I have taken into  account  the  case  of R
    (Iran) v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 982, where Brooke LJ summarised  at  [9]
    the errors on points of law that will most frequently be encountered in
    practice:

         "9.      ...


             (i) making perverse or irrational  findings  on  a  matter  or
             matters that were material to the outcome;


             (ii)      failing to give reasons or any adequate reasons  for
             findings on material matters;


             (iii)      failing  to  take  into  account   and/or   resolve
             conflicts of fact or opinion on material matters;


             (iv)      giving weight to immaterial matters;


             (v) making a material misdirection  of  law  on  any  material
             matter;


             (vi)      committing  or  permitting  a  procedural  or  other
             irregularity capable of making a material  difference  to  the
             outcome or the fairness of the proceedings;


             (vii)     making a mistake as to a material fact  which  could
             be established by objective and uncontentious evidence,  where
             the appellant and/or his advisers were not responsible for the
             mistake, and where unfairness resulted from the  fact  that  a
             mistake was made."

 9. The Judge was required  to  make  an  adequate  legally  and  factually
    finding, a proper assessment of the best interests  of  the  qualifying
    child in that it must be based on a careful consideration of the likely
    circumstances of the qualified child, if returned as a  unit  to  India
    which was not adequately done.

10. Having considered the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, in the
    round, I am of the view that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  fall
    into material error by concentrating on the parents'  conduct  are  not
    the best interests of the child.

11. In the circumstances I direct that the appeal be remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal to be heard de novo  and  placed  before  any  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge other than Judge Freer.
