Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Knight (Legal Justice Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of BSM, a citizen of Afghanistan accepted born  25
       May 1983, against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  12
       August 2016 dismissing his appeal against the Home Office refusal  of
       his asylum claim of 30 November 2015.


    2. The Appellant's asylum claim, summarised in the refusal  letter,  was
       that he was a Sikh who had been attacked by the Taliban and  harassed
       by Muslims due to his religion; a few months before arriving  in  the
       UK he had been attacked and  beaten  by  Muslims  who  threatened  to
       kidnap his wife and convert her to Islam. His wife had also  suffered
       harassment. He feared they would be targeted  wherever  he  lived  in
       Afghanistan.

    3. His claim was refused because the Secretary of State considered  that
       his  account  of  past  events  contained   materially   inconsistent
       statements in that at interview he had stated that he was attacked by
       Muslims some months earlier and that there had been no other physical
       exchanges; but that in his witness  statement,  he  had  referred  to
       violence from both the Taliban and Muslims  in  different  incidents.
       This undermined his account of suffering actual violence, and it  was
       not accepted that in general Afghan Sikhs faced persecution  applying
       the relevant Country Guidelines.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal duly heard  the  appeal  that  the  Appellant
       lodged against that decision, hearing oral evidence from him and  his
       wife AMK, who was dependent upon his application. She explained  that
       her father had been killed by the Taliban,  and  confirmed  that  her
       husband's account of their experiences was  accurate.  The  Appellant
       gave further details of the problems they had suffered: he  had  been
       unable to study, had become ostracised from his parents who  resented
       the fact that his marriage and  the  consequent  arrival  of  another
       female into their community brought further  adverse  attention  from
       Muslims, and their home had been visited  by  both  the  Taliban  and
       other Muslims who had shouted verbal abuse at them.  Gurdwaras  could
       not provide them with  any  support  as  they  could  barely  subsist
       themselves given the ever-reducing numbers  of  remaining  Sikhs.  He
       felt that if he had children the cycle of fear would simply continue,
       destroying their well-being. As to the discrepancy as to  the  number
       of attacks he had suffered, he believed that must have arisen from  a
       mis-recording of an answer at his interview: had this been picked  up
       by his representatives, they would have raised it amongst  the  other
       matters they took up with the Home Office following  that  interview,
       when they addressed a number of interpreting errors.


    5. The First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appeal,  finding  that  the
       Appellant's evidence  was  not  credible,  because  of  a  number  of
       features of his account that it considered implausible,  and  because
       of the discrepancy identified by  the  Home  Office  in  the  refusal
       letter, which it thought too  serious  to  be  explained  away  by  a
       representative's oversight.

    6. Grounds of appeal alleged that  the  decision  failed  to  adequately
       evaluate the plight of the Appellant's wife or the diminished private
       life  that  the  couple  would  endure  in   Afghanistan,   and   was
       inconsistent with the prevailing Country Guidelines.

    7. Granting permission to appeal on 26 September 2016,  Judge  Gillespie
       for the First-tier Tribunal noted that no findings had been  made  on
       the oral evidence of the Appellant's  wife,  which  was  an  arguable
       error of law; additionally the failure to give adequate attention  to
       her circumstances might well undermine the reasoning on their private
       life on a return to Afghanistan.

    8. A response from the Secretary of State contended the decision  was  a
       lawful one that was rationally open to the First-tier Tribunal.

    9. Before me Mr  Knight  efficiently  summarised  the  original  grounds
       which, taken together  with  the  observations  of  Judge  Gillespie,
       effectively amounted to two arguments: that the failure  to  evaluate
       the  potentially  corroborative  effect  of  the   wife's   testimony
       fundamentally flawed the decision, and that the  Tribunal  below  had
       failed to take account  of  relevant  considerations  in  determining
       whether  there  were  very  significant  obstacles  to   the   pair's
       integration  in   Afghanistan   given   the   undoubtedly   difficult
       circumstances that faced Afghan Sikhs generally. Mr Richards accepted
       that both grounds had significant force and in the circumstances felt
       unable to defend the decision below.


Findings and reasons

   10. It seems to me that the parties were correct to agree before me  that
       the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was fundamentally flawed  and
       in those circumstances I can give my reasons relatively briefly.


   11. As to the asylum dimension of  the  claim,  making  findings  on  the
       evidence of a material witness is plainly a vital aspect of a  lawful
       decision. In this appeal the wife provided a witness statement  which
       she adopted before the First-tier Tribunal, and upon  which  she  was
       cross examined. The Country Guidelines determination of TG and others
       (Afghan Sikhs persecuted) (CG) [2015] UKUT 595 (IAC) sets out that:


           "(i)  Some  members  of  the  Sikh  and  Hindu  communities   in
           Afghanistan continue to suffer harassment at the hands of Muslim
           zealots.
           (ii) Members of the Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan do
           not face a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment such as  to
           entitle them to a grant of international protection on the basis
           of their ethnic or religious identity, per se. Neither can it be
           said that the cumulative impact of  discrimination  suffered  by
           the Sikh and Hindu communities in general reaches the  threshold
           of persecution.
           (iii) A consideration of whether an  individual  member  of  the
           Sikh and Hindu communities is at risk real of  persecution  upon
           return  to  Afghanistan  is  fact-sensitive.  All  the  relevant
           circumstances must be considered but careful attention should be
           paid to the following:
           a.  women  are  particularly  vulnerable  in  the   absence   of
           appropriate protection from a male member of the family;
           b. likely financial circumstances and ability  to  access  basic
           accommodation bearing in mind
           - Muslims are generally unlikely to employ a member of the  Sikh
           and Hindu communities
           - such individuals may  face  difficulties  (including  threats,
           extortion, seizure of land and acts of  violence)  in  retaining
           property and / or pursuing their remaining traditional  pursuit,
           that of a shopkeeper / trader
           - the traditional source of support for  such  individuals,  the
           Gurdwara is much less able to provide adequate support;
           c.  the  level  of  religious   devotion   and   the   practical
           accessibility to a suitable place of religious worship in  light
           of declining numbers  and  the  evidence  that  some  have  been
           subjected to harm and  threats  to  harm  whilst  accessing  the
           Gurdwara;
           d. access to appropriate education  for  children  in  light  of
           discrimination against Sikh and Hindu children and the  shortage
           of adequate education facilities for them.
           (iv) Although it appears there is a willingness at  governmental
           level to provide  protection,  it  is  not  established  on  the
           evidence that at a local level the police are willing,  even  if
           able, to provide the necessary level of protection  required  in
           Refugee  Convention/Qualification  Directive  terms,  to   those
           members of the Sikh and Hindu communities who experience serious
           harm or harassment amounting to persecution.
           (v)  Whether it is reasonable to expect a member of the Sikh  or
           Hindu communities to relocate is a  fact  sensitive  assessment.
           The relevant factors to be considered include those set  out  at
           (iii) above. Given their particular circumstances and  declining
           number, the practicability of settling elsewhere for members  of
           the Sikh and Hindu communities  must  be  carefully  considered.
           Those without access to an independent income are unlikely to be
           able  to  reasonably  relocate  because  of   depleted   support
           mechanisms."

   12. It can readily be seen that a number of themes identified as relevant
       by  those  conclusions  were  addressed  in   her   evidence,   which
       potentially corroborated aspects  of  the  Appellant's  account,  for
       example that his father-in-law (her own father) had died at the hands
       of the Taliban. Beyond that, the risks  she  faced,  via  threats  of
       kidnapping and the discrimination she had suffered as a  woman,  were
       plainly  relevant  to  the  overall  assessment   of   the   couple's
       circumstances.

   13. As to the private life aspect of the appeal, the relevant sub-limb of
       the relevant Rule is 276ADE(vi), ie  whether  "there  would  be  very
       significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into the country
       to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK." As  stated
       by Sales LJ in Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813, the concept of integration



           "is not confined to the mere ability to find a job or to sustain
           life while living in the other country. It is not appropriate to
           treat the statutory language as subject to  some  gloss  and  it
           will usually be sufficient for a court  or  tribunal  simply  to
           direct itself in the terms that Parliament has  chosen  to  use.
           The idea of "integration" calls for a broad evaluative  judgment
           to be made as to whether the individual will  be  enough  of  an
           insider in terms of understanding how life  in  the  society  in
           that other country is carried on and a capacity  to  participate
           in it, so as to have a reasonable  opportunity  to  be  accepted
           there, to be able to operate  on  a  day-to-day  basis  in  that
           society and to build up within a reasonable time  a  variety  of
           human  relationships  to  give  substance  to  the  individual's
           private or family life."

   14. The First-tier Tribunal states:

           "The Appellant has not shown that there would be very
           significant obstacles to his integration into Afghanistan ...
           The Appellant was born and brought up in Afghanistan and was
           engaged in gainful employment. He has spent all his life in
           Afghanistan. His wife is also a national of Afghanistan. He
           speaks the languages."


   15. That passage does not engage with the general background evidence, as
       evinced  in  the  findings  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  giving  Country
       Guidelines in TG, which noted that there was  ongoing  harassment  of
       and discrimination  against  some  members  of  the  Sikh  and  Hindu
       community in Afghanistan notwithstanding that it did not  in  general
       reach the  level  of  cumulative  intensity  required  to  constitute
       persecution.  At  �87  the  Tribunal  accepted  the  possibility   of
       discrimination at the hand of Muslim zealots. Such acts include  name
       calling, spitting, the throwing of stones and rocks, threats and acts
       of violence". Patently  circumstances  of  that  nature  represent  a
       potential barrier to integration that is relevant.


   16. This is not an appeal where there are meaningful findings upon  which
       the Upper Tribunal can build, and thus it is allowed  to  the  extent
       that it is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.

ANONYMITY ORDER

Although the matter was not raised  before  me  or  so  far  as  I  can  see
previously, the Appellant's claim involves asylum issues and so, unless  and
until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is  granted
anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family.  This direction  applies  both  to
the Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply with this  direction
could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
