                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This determination has been prepared following a resumed hearing in the
    Upper Tribunal at Field House.  By a decision dated 28 May 2014,  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Clive Lane found that the determination  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dated 27 March 2014 should be set aside.  The text of his
    decision and directions is set out below:

 2. The first appellant, BS, was born on 24  July  1981  and  is  a  female
    citizen of India.  The second, third  and  fourth  appellants  are  the
    children of the first appellant.  I shall refer to the first  appellant
    as "the appellant" throughout this determination.

 3. The appellant was convicted on 15 May 2012  and  sentenced  to  fifteen
    months' imprisonment  for  three  offences  relating  to  dealing  with
    criminal property and the third offence for possessing an  article  for
    use in fraud.   Her  co-defendant  in  the  criminal  proceedings,  her
    husband, was sentenced to ten years'  imprisonment  for  five  offences
    concerning fraud.

 4. The appellant had first entered the United Kingdom in July 2003 and all
    of her children (except for the second appellant)  were  born  in  this
    country.  On 15 April 2013, a decision was made to make  a  deportation
    order against the appellant under Section 5(1) of the  Immigration  Act
    1971.   Decisions  were  also  made  under  Section  3(5)(b)   of   the
    Immigration Act 1971 in respect of the three dependent  children.   The
    appellants appealed against those decisions to the First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Pullig; Mrs L Schmitt JP) which, in a determination  promulgated
    on 31 March 2014, dismissed the appeals.  The  appellants  now  appeal,
    with permission, granted by Judge Shimmin on  22  April  2014,  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 5. At the Upper Tribunal initial hearing, the appellants were  represented
    by Miss Jegarajah of Counsel  who  had  also  drafted  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  The first challenge to the Tribunal's  determination  concerns
    the appellant's assertion that she was  denied  a  fair  hearing.   The
    appellant had appeared without professional representatives before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal.   She  had,  however,  engaged   in   a   lengthy
    correspondence with the Tribunal  and  the  Presenting  Officers'  Unit
    concerning the documentary  evidence  upon  which  she  understood  the
    respondent intended to rely, but which she had not seen.  Judge  Pullig
    (who conducted the Case Management Review) helpfully prepared a note of
    that review dated 10 June  2013  in  which  he  gives  details  of  the
    problems which the appellant had experienced up to that date.  However,
    the respondent continued  to  file  evidence  in  connection  with  the
    appeal.  In its determination at [49], the Tribunal wrote:

    The respondent's supplementary bundle  had  been  submitted  some  time
    before the hearing.  This [the appellant] has since, in  January  2014,
    complained about, saying it had been served on her one hour before  the
    hearing.  We return to this later but note now that  no  complaint  was
    raised about it at the time.  Irrespective of the appellant's  lack  of
    knowledge of the Procedure Rules, the appellant did not mention at  the
    hearing that she had been served late with any documents that left  her
    unprepared or at any disadvantage.  We believe she  had  this  in  good
    time.  What was served later was a  respondent's  second  supplementary
    bundle and, as will be seen below, there was  nothing  in  that  bundle
    that would not have already been known to her.

 6. The judge goes on to  give  details  of  the  contents  of  the  second
    supplementary bundle at [50]:

    In this bundle, there is a twelve page summary prepared by Metropolitan
    Police officers,  from  SCD9  Operation  Swale  tasked  with  combating
    organised immigration crime.  This sets  out  further  details  of  the
    cases  against  the  appellant  and  her  husband  leading   to   their
    convictions.  This sets out much of the detail of the cases against the
    couple, albeit principally Mr S.

 7. The bundle also contained a case summary identifying the  appellant  as
    the account holder of several personal  bank  accounts,  together  with
    statements from a DC Curry and a Ms Rajshakha, a financial investigator
    with the National Crime Agency.  The grounds of appeal [12] assert that
    "the  bundle  comprised  materials  that  sought  to  incriminate   the
    appellant by implying that the appellant was currently or  had  benefit
    from the proceeds of crime and that she paid a far  greater  role  than
    that  for  which  she  was  originally  convicted."   As  the  Tribunal
    acknowledged [22], the confiscation proceedings had led  [in  September
    2013] to the making of a nominal order against the  appellant.   Whilst
    an order was made against her husband for ï¿½799,227.67 to be paid within
    six months.  Miss Jegarajah submitted that the papers submitted late by
    the  respondent  sought,  in  effect,  to  go  behind  that  order   by
    attributing  to  the   appellant   a   greater   degree   of   criminal
    responsibility in the money laundering and  other  fraud  offences  for
    which she and her husband had been convicted.  Miss Jegarajah submitted
    that a larger bundle of papers, upon which the  respondent  had  relied
    before the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  which  is  referred  to  in  the
    determination, had, in fact, never been sent to the  appellant  at  all
    and she had not seen it until May 2014.  Miss Jegarajah submitted  that
    the unusual nature of this appeal raised complex and difficult  matters
    (she admitted herself that she had received assistance from  colleagues
    who had explained to her  the  various  terms  used  in  the  documents
    relating to the criminal confiscation  proceedings)  and  that  it  was
    unfair for the judge to have proceeded with the hearing without  giving
    the unrepresented appellant the opportunity to consider all the papers.



 8. Mr Saunders, for the respondent, acknowledged  that  the  Tribunal  had
    considered  all  the  documentary  evidence,  including  those   papers
    submitted by the respondent immediately before the hearing; indeed,  he
    submitted that the Tribunal had been obliged to set out particulars  of
    all the evidence and had duly done so.  However, he submitted that  the
    Tribunal had restricted its determination of the appeal to the evidence
    concerning  the  appellant's  own  offending,  including  the   judge's
    sentencing remarks and to evidence concerning  the  likelihood  of  her
    reoffending.  Any prejudicial evidence had not,  therefore,  "infected"
    the ratio of the Tribunal's decision.

 9. Evidence of an appellant's conduct may be adduced  in  proceedings  for
    removal, including deportation, whilst the Tribunal is  not  restricted
    to considering evidence relating only to the index  offence  which  has
    given rise to the deportation decision.  However, the  Tribunal  has  a
    duty to ensure that a fair hearing takes place, adjourning  proceedings
    where necessary, to give an party sufficient time  to  study  documents
    and to respond.  These matters were addressed by the Upper Tribunal  in
    Farquharson (removal - proof of conduct) [2013] UKUT 00146 (IAC).   In
    that case, the Secretary of State had sought to rely upon  evidence  of
    the appellant's conduct which had not resulted in criminal  conviction.
    Much of the evidence was contained in  CRIS  reports  (Crime  Recording
    Information System).  In the present appeal, the respondent  has  filed
    at  the  Tribunal  and  served  upon  the  appellant  written  evidence
    (including the statements of witnesses who were then tendered for cross-
    examination  at  the  hearing)  of  investigations  peripheral  to  the
    appellant's conviction.  DC Curry had given evidence, as  the  Tribunal
    noted, regarding "the criminal aspects" of the case, in particular  the
    criminal  offending  of  the  appellant's   husband.    The   financial
    investigator, Ms Rajshakha, had given detailed evidence  regarding  the
    application for confiscation orders.  I am  satisfied,  notwithstanding
    the Tribunal's comments at [49] that the appellant did not receive  "in
    good time" all the written evidence upon which the respondent sought to
    rely. I am satisfied that the larger bundle of papers upon  which  the
    respondent  relied  had  not,  for  whatever  reason  (it  appears  the
    appellant changed address during the course of the  proceedings),  ever
    been seen by her prior to the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing.   I have
    considered those observations in the light of the  conclusions  of  the
    Tribunal in Farquharson as [88-93]:


    88.        We regret the passage of sixteen months  between  the  UKBA
    decision and the final determination of this appeal by the Tribunal, as
    the appellant has been in immigration detention throughout  this  time.
    We hope that there may be some lessons to be  learned  from  this  case
    that will make effective and  fair  decision  making  possible  in  the
    future within a significantly shortened time scale.


    89.        First, the UKBA must consider carefully what allegations of
    conduct it wishes to rely on in the absence of a  conviction  or  other
    authoritative finding of fact. In our judgement the agency  should  not
    allege conduct that it is not prepared  to  prove  to  the  appropriate
    civil standard. The decision in Bah demonstrates that conduct based on
    intelligence and crime reports can be relied on in immigration  appeals
    provided that there is  some  decree  of  transparency  about  how  the
    material is accumulated and what it consists of. If intelligence is  so
    sensitive that a sufficient gist of it cannot  be  disclosed,  then  it
    should not be raised in the appeal. Mere assertion will not be enough.


    90.        Second, where deportation or removal proceedings are  based
    on information derived from police sources, a police witness  statement
    should be made available enclosing the relevant  documentary  material.
    That material must fairly reflect the strengths and weaknesses  of  any
    assessment and should not be cherry picked to present one side only  if
    there is material that exculpates as well as inculpates.   The  witness
    statement should reveal that  this  exercise  has  been  undertaken  to
    obviate the need for third party disclosure requests  under  the  Upper
    Tribunal Rules. The judge must ensure that the hearing is fair.


    91.        Third, material is likely to be considered the more cogent,
    the greater the extent to which  it  is  supported  by  other  relevant
    documents. In the present case we have searched for  data  relating  to
    the incidents independent of  the  complainant's  narrative.  The  CRIS
    extracts might have  been  supported  by  witness  statements  made  by
    forensic medical examiners or eye-witnesses. This will  not  always  be
    necessary, and the Tribunal is not conducting a re-trial,  but  it  may
    well prove helpful. We anticipate that the CPS should be able to assist
    the UKBA and indeed the Tribunal  and,  where  material  is  sensitive,
    appropriate directions as  to  its  return  and  use  can  be  made  if
    requested in advance.


    92.        Fourth, the material relied  on  should  be  served  on  an
    appellant in good time so he can read it,  understand  it  and  prepare
    such response to it as is considered appropriate.  Thus, service of the
    witness statement of DC Mahmood on the day of the adjourned  First-tier
    hearing was far too late to give such a fair  opportunity.  Further  as
    the grounds of appeal stated and we agree, this statement  was  in  any
    event insufficient to enable the judge to reach independent conclusions
    without the supporting documentary material. The first tranche of  such
    material was only served on the appellant at the adjourned date of  the
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal; again that was far too late for this
    appellant to be able to absorb and respond  to  although  he  had  been
    aware of  DC Mahmood's witness statement for nearly a  year.  If  there
    has been a significant shift in the way a case is put from the original
    decision letter, a brief skeleton argument identifying the real  issues
    would be helpful to the Tribunal and opposing party.


    93.        Fifth, it is important that legal representation should  be
    available in such cases. The appellant told us that his reading ability
    is not great. He was able to read back parts of his statement to us  to
    our satisfaction, but absorbing the detail in the  CRIS  reports  would
    undoubtedly have been a challenge without professional assistance.  The
    appellant will also have been disadvantaged by a long  period  of  pre-
    appeal detention. We hope that legal aid is  granted  readily  in  such
    cases whatever the apparent weight of the case against him. Without  it
    there is a very real risk that his common law right to a  fair  hearing
    will be undermined.




10. I am not satisfied, to adopt the expression used  by  the  Tribunal  in
    Farquharson that the material relied upon by the respondent was "served
    on the appellant in good time [so that she could] read  it,  understand
    it and prepare such a response to it as is considered appropriate."   I
    considered the appellant's problems are compounded by the fact that she
    did not have  a  professional  representative;  indeed,  had  she  been
    represented it is likely an application for an adjournment  would  have
    been made so the documents might be considered.

11. In the circumstances, I  find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should be set aside.  However, the  onward  progress  of  this
    appeal presents a number of problems.  Miss Jegarajah's  second  ground
    of appeal raises the question  as  to  whether  the  documents  in  the
    respondent's supplementary and second supplementary bundles  should  be
    considered by the Tribunal in any event.  She relies on  an  unreported
    decision (AG (Ivory Coast) C5/2012/1442) in which permission to  appeal
    was granted by Sir Stephen Sedley in December 2012:

         It is cogently arguable that the introduction of highly prejudicial
         police intelligence  reports  was  procedurally  and  substantively
         impermissible.  ...  In the present case where the Maslov  question
         was critical, the reports are capable of having tipped the balance.



12. Miss Jegarajah  submitted  that  the  inclusion  of  the  case  summary
    exhibits and the admission of the  two  witnesses  for  the  respondent
    raise a similar issue.  Her grounds at [32] state:

    The  entire  case  against  the  appellant  in  these  [her   emphasis]
    proceedings related to whether the  appellant  was  telling  the  truth
    about whether she has benefited from criminal acts and to what  extent.
    But that has nothing to do with the case as advanced by the  respondent
    in writing.

13. I am satisfied  that  the  decision  should  be  remade  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  Mr Saunders told me that he would appreciate time to prepare
    his arguments in respect of this second limb of the appellant's grounds
    of appeal.  In the circumstances, I direct that the  appeal  should  be
    adjourned to a resumed hearing following which the Tribunal will remake
    the decision but at which the  Tribunal  will  first  consider  further
    argument from both parties as to  (a)  the  evidence  which  it  should
    consider in remaking the decision and; (b) which findings  of  fact  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (if any) shall stand.

14. I therefore direct as follows:

      i) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal dated 27 March 2014 is
         set aside.  The Upper Tribunal shall remake the decision  following
         a resumed hearing.

     ii) The parties shall file at the Tribunal and serve  upon  each  other
         skeleton arguments which shall, inter alia, deal with:

          a) the evidence the Upper Tribunal shall consider in the  appeal;
             and

          b) which findings of fact of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (if  any)
             shall stand.

         Skeleton arguments shall be filed and served  no  later  than  five
         working days prior to the resumed hearing.

15. At the resumed hearing at  Field  House  on  10  September  2014,  Miss
    Jegarajah of Counsel appeared for the appellants and  Mr  K  Norton,  a
    Senior Home Office Presenting Officer, appeared for the respondent.

16. Both parties had, belatedly, complied with the direction  to  file  and
    serve skeleton arguments.  We have had regard to those written skeleton
    arguments and also to the oral submissions made to us.  We have  remade
    the decision and dismissed the  appeal  of  the  appellants  under  the
    Immigration Rules and human rights grounds. Our reasons  for  doing  so
    are as follows:

17.  At  the  outset  of  the  resumed  hearing,   we   stressed   to   the
    representatives that an error of law had been found in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal determination only  in  relation  to  the  procedural  matter.
    Having regard to the  fact  that  the  first  appellant  had  been  not
    represented by professional advisers before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    the Upper Tribunal had found that a large volume of  new  material  had
    been provided by the Secretary  of  State  to  the  appellant  but  the
    appellant had not been given adequate time to consider  that  material.
    The Tribunal had not found an error of law in  relation  to  the  other
    grounds which the Tribunal had made clear by directions issued  to  the
    parties should be considered at the resumed hearing.  As  we  explained
    to the advocates, we  considered  that  the  purpose  of  that  resumed
    hearing was to determine whether (i) that the findings of fact  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal should stand; (ii) whether the Tribunal had  regard
    to prejudicial evidence which it should have excluded in  consideration
    in reaching its determination; (iii) whether the  Tribunal   based  its
    findings and conclusions upon that material and (iv) if it did  not  do
    so, whether the presence of that  material  before  it  "infected"  the
    Tribunal's reasoning in a manner which is unfair to the appellant.

18. The First-tier Tribunal considered  at  length  the  oral  and  written
    evidence of DC Curry and Mrs Rajshakha.  DC Curry was formerly  of  the
    Immigration Crime Team and  had  been  involved  in  investigating  the
    criminal activities of the appellant and her husband.  Mrs Rajshakha is
    a financial investigator with the National Crime Agency in  London  and
    had been involved in investigating the whereabouts of funds obtained by
    fraud.  Miss Jegarajah submitted that the evidence of DC Curry and Miss
    Rajshakha  should  have  been  excluded  entirely  by  the   First-tier
    Tribunal.  The Tribunal should have confined itself to consideration of
    the known facts, namely the appellant's conviction at  Isleworth  Crown
    Court in May 2012 for three offences relating to dealing with  criminal
    property and possessing an article for use in fraud for which  she  had
    received a term of imprisonment of fifteen  months.   Her  husband  had
    been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for five offences  of  fraud.
    Miss Jegarajah submitted that it  was  legitimate  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to have considered the judge's sentencing remarks but had,  in
    effect, treated  the  evidence  of  DC  Curry  and  Miss  Rajshakha  as
    established facts when there was nothing to suggest that  the  Criminal
    Court had accepted all that evidence as true.  Likewise,  the  evidence
    of Miss Rajshakha which had been used in the  compensation  proceedings
    was prejudicial to the appellant, given that she  had  ultimately  been
    ordered to repay only a nominal sum of ï¿½1.   Miss  Jegarajah  submitted
    that it had not  been  open  to  the  Tribunal  to  conclude  that  the
    appellant had lied to it by claiming not to know  whether  the  sum  of
    ï¿½460,000 illegally obtained by her husband had been spent or laundered.



19. We reject Miss Jegarajah's submission.  The Tribunal  has  set  out  at
    length the evidence of the witnesses (including the appellant)  but  we
    reject the submission that by doing so it has in some way elevated that
    evidence to the level of accepted fact. The appellant and her husband's
    criminal offending lies at the very heart of this  appeal  and  it  was
    entirely proper for  the  Tribunal  to  consider  evidence,  from  both
    parties, as to the whereabouts of missing fraudulently-obtained  funds;
    the Tribunal had no idea as to the details of the agreement subject  to
    which the confiscation proceedings had been settled and  there  was  no
    reason at all for the Tribunal to have refrained from  considering  the
    whereabouts of the missing funds simply because the appellant had  been
    ordered to make a nominal payment. Evidence as to the appellant's  life
    style and her conduct was relevant in enabling  the  Tribunal  to  test
    whether her claim that she did  not  know  what  had  happened  to  the
    missing funds was truthful. Indeed, as  the  Tribunal  noted  at  [112]
    neither  the  appellant  nor  her  husband  had   argued   "about   the
    confiscation of proceeds".

20. Furthermore, it is important to look at the actual findings of fact  of
    the Tribunal rather than at its account of the evidence it  heard.   At
    [138 - 144] the Tribunal dealt with the appellant's  credibility.   The
    Tribunal did not accept the appellant's claim that she had only limited
    knowledge of her husband's business and criminal offending or that  she
    did not know where the sum of ï¿½466,000 "had gone or what  it  had  been
    spent or how much is left".  The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  accept
    [141] that the appellant was telling the truth when  she  claimed  that
    her house had been purchased "by way of a loan from 40 or 50 people and
    that the ï¿½466,000 had been used or at least part of it had been used to
    repay them". The respondent had adduced evidence on  these  matters  as
    had the appellant and the  Tribunal  reached  the  legitimate  finding,
    supported by cogent reasons, that the appellant had  not  been  telling
    the truth. We find that there is no suggestion that  the  Tribunal  has
    simply accepted each and every part of  the  respondent's  evidence  as
    true; it has quite properly made findings  on  matters  which  were  in
    dispute. Indeed, the appellant herself had asserted that she  had  been
    telling the truth regarding  these  matters  and  no  doubt  sought  to
    advance her case before the  Tribunal  by  doing  so.  These  were  all
    matters which formed part of the appellant's circumstances to which the
    Tribunal properly had regard when considering Article 8 ECHR.

21. Significantly, the remaining paragraphs of the determination concerning
    the appellant's credibility deal with the appellant's claims  that  she
    and the children would suffer language and other problems  upon  return
    to India (which the Tribunal rejected) and the claim that she might  be
    at risk from those individuals whom  her  husband  had  defrauded.  The
    Tribunal rejected that claim also. Those were both matters  upon  which
    the disputed evidence adduced by  the  respondent  had  little  if  any
    bearing whatever.

22. In summary, Miss Jegarajah has failed to persuade us  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal should have excluded the evidence of DC  Curry  and  Miss
    Rajshakha or that the Tribunal has in any way conducted its analysis of
    the evidence by accepting the evidence of those witnesses as fact; that
    the findings as to the appellant's lack of credibility were reached  by
    anything other than a  proper  and  even-handed  analysis  of  all  the
    relevant evidence.

23. We also rejected Miss Jegarajah's  submission  that  the  Tribunal  has
    allowed the evidence of the appellant's husband's offending unfairly to
    influence its assessment of the appellant's own circumstances. We  find
    that the Tribunal was well aware of the possible pitfalls of permitting
    the husband's criminal offending to taint its analysis;  at  [187]  the
    Tribunal noted that;

    the appellant's conviction cannot be viewed in isolation  from that  of
    her husband.  Whilst we do not impute any of his guilt to  her,  we  do
    note that of which the appellant  was  convicted  was  ancillary  to  a
    fraudulent scheme specifically designed go circumvent  the  immigration
    control.  Public interest is significant for that  reason  even  though
    her offence is no greater than the sentence tells us.

    We consider that to be an entirely correct approach. The Tribunal  also
    correctly observed [188] that the appellant's  own  immigration  status
    had been obtained for her by her husband by fraud.  These  observations
    appear in a part of the determination  headed  "The  Public  Interest";
    there  is  no  mention  made  whatsoever  in  that   section   of   the
    determination to  the  disputed  evidence  upon  which  the  respondent
    relied.

24. Miss Jegarajah also submitted that the Tribunal had been "left  in  the
    dark  as  to  the  nature  and  extent  of   the   CPS/National   Crime
    Agency/Police involvement and engagement with the immigration process".
      She noted that this was an "Operation  Nexus"  case  involving  joint
    operations  between  the  police  and  the  immigration  services.  She
    complained that the exact nature of that  process  had  not  been  made
    clear to the  appellant.   Whatever  the  merits  of  Miss  Jegarajah's
    argument, we do not see  how  it  touches  upon  the  legality  of  the
    Tribunal's decision.  As we have stated, the Tribunal was  entitled  to
    consider the evidence of DC Curry and Miss  Rajshakha  and  we  do  not
    accept that it should have excluded the evidence  because  it  had  not
    been given details of Operation Nexus or of any interaction between the
    immigration services and the police.  Miss Jegarajah also  relied  upon
    the letter written by Lloyds PR Solicitors to the  appellant  which  is
    dated 7 June 2013 and deals with an application to vary the terms of  a
    restraint order at Isleworth Crown Court.  Recalling what had been said
    in court, the letter states that

    the prosecution Counsel said that the Crown hoped to effectively  force
    the defendant to leave the UK and return to India where the Crown could
    monitor her to see if she spent any of  the  hidden  assets  which  had
    allegedly been sent to India. He said that the deportation  order  made
    by the Home Office was separate and ought to be  allowed  to  take  its
    course.

25. Miss Jegarajah submitted that  the  deportation  proceedings  had  been
    employed by the Secretary of State for an improper purpose,  namely  to
    held other statutory bodies in the United Kingdom to "flush out"  funds
    which the appellant and/or her husband had hidden abroad".  We  do  not
    accept that submission.   It  may  well  assist  those  United  Kingdom
    enforcement authorities seeking confiscation of the  appellant  or  her
    husband's illegally-gained funds if the appellant is returned to  India
    but we do not see how that undermines or renders unlawful the Secretary
    of State's decision to remove the appellant  under  the  provisions  of
    Section 3(5) of the  Immigration  Act  1971.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    accepted that the appellant's deportation would  be  conducive  to  the
    public good; it matters not, in our opinion,  whether  her  deportation
    might also happen to promote the legitimate work of  crime  enforcement
    agencies.

26. For the reasons we have given above, we find that there is no reason to
    revisit the findings of fact of the First-tier  Tribunal.   Whilst  the
    Tribunal erred by not giving an unrepresented appellant  adequate  time
    to consider evidence adduced by the respondent at  very  short  notice,
    that evidence was properly accepted as  admissible  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Now that  the  appellant  and  her  advisers  have  had  the
    opportunity of considering the evidence, they  have  submitted  nothing
    which would lead us to conclude that the First-tier Tribunal's analysis
    and its decision should be reversed.

27. In the circumstances, therefore, we have remade the decision.  We  find
    that the appeal should be dismissed under both  the  Immigration  Rules
    and on human rights grounds.

DECISION

28. This appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

29. This appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.
