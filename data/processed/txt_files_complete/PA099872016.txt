                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. FS is a national of Iran born in 1985. On the 8th June 2017 the First-
       tier Tribunal (Judge Myers) allowed his appeal on protection grounds,
       finding as fact that FS had  converted  from  Islam  to  Christianity
       since his arrival in the UK and that as a result would be at risk  of
       persecution  in  Iran  for  reasons  of  his  religious  belief.  The
       Secretary of State for the Home  Department  now  has  permission  to
       appeal against that decision, inter alia  on  the  grounds  that  the
       First-tier Tribunal was not entitled to take the  alleged  conversion
       into account, it being a 'new matter' within the meaning of s85(5) of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended).

    2. There has been a some delay in the determination of this  appeal,  in
       part because further written submissions were sought from the parties
       after the  decision in Mahmud (s85 NIAA 2002 - 'new matters')  [2017]
       UKUT 488 (IAC)  was  promulgated.   As  to  the  delay  that  accrued
       thereafter, the parties have my apologies.

       Anonymity Direction

    3. This case concerns a claim for international protection.  Having  had
       regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
       2008 and the Presidential Guidance  Note  No  1  of  2013:  Anonymity
       Orders I therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the
       following terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  both  the
           Appellant and the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

       Background and First-tier Tribunal Decision

    4. On the 4th March 2016 FS made an 'in-country' claim  for  protection.
       The basis of his claim was that he was a researcher and  lecturer  in
       Neuro-Linguistic Programming and 'Erikson hypnotism', and  that  some
       of  his  work  was  perceived  to  have  fallen  outwith  the  strict
       boundaries  of  Islamic  education  as  approved   by   the   Iranian
       authorities. In interviews conducted on the 5th March  2016  and  the
       10th August 2016 he told officers that his  work  explored  the  area
       between science and faith and that as a result he was perceived as  a
       threat to the regime.   He  had  been  threatened  and  the  security
       services had raided  his  home.  When  they  had  done  so  they  had
       retrieved materials which confirmed their suspicions that FS was 'un-
       Islamic': these included a copy of the Bible, Zoroastrian  texts  and
       banned history books.

    5. Protection was refused by way of letter dated the 2nd September  2016
       and FS exercised his right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    6. On the 2nd February 2017 the First-tier  Tribunal  conducted  a  pre-
       hearing review. The form completed by the judge that day  notes  that
       FS intended to call at least one witness from a  church.   FS  lodged
       his appeal bundle on the 24th May 2017.  This  included  his  witness
       statement dated 23rd May 2017, a letter from Reverend  Pybon  of  the
       Spendmore Lane Methodist Church and  two  certificates:  one  showing
       that FS had been baptised on 'Easter  eve  2016'  at  Holy  Innocents
       Church in Fallowfield, the second showing that he  was  confirmed  in
       the same church on the 14th May 2017. I note  that  Easter  eve  2016
       fell on the 26th March 2016.

    7. The matter came before Judge Myers on the 31st May 2017. Counsel  for
       FS indicated that he wished to call  FS,  Dorodian  witness  Reverend
       Pybun, and a man named M, another  Iranian  who  had  introduced  the
       Appellant to church in the UK. The Home Office Presenting Officer  Mr
       Hunt-Jackson informed the Tribunal that  he  had  only  received  the
       appeal bundle that morning and that he had not  been  aware  that  FS
       intended to submit that  he  was  a  Christian.  He  applied  for  an
       adjournment.  The  determination  [at  ï¿½5]  explains  the  Tribunal's
       response:

           "I allowed Mr Hunt-Jackson some time to prepare the case and  to
           make inquiries about the Appellant's witness, however I  refused
           the request  for  an  adjournment  on  the  basis  that  in  all
           probability the Respondent would not take the opportunity to  re
           interview the Appellant and it was in the interests  of  justice
           to proceed because of the attendance of the witness".

    8. The Tribunal proceeded to hear the case and having done so  found  as
       fact that the Appellant had converted to  Christianity  and  that  he
       would be at risk for  that  reason  in  Iran.   Its  summary  of  his
       evidence noted that the Iranian security services had found  a  bible
       in his home, and that he had met M on his way to the UK. M claimed to
       be fleeing Iran because he had converted to  Christianity.   FS  told
       the Tribunal that whilst he had been living in Iran he had  developed
       an interest in Christianity, and felt a sense of salvation and  peace
       when he read the bible.  The Tribunal accepted his evidence, and that
       of his witnesses. It noted that he was a regular church-goer and that
       he had been since his arrival in the  UK.  As  to  the  most  obvious
       credibility point weighing against FS - his failure to mention any of
       this when interviewed - the Tribunal accepted that he had been  upset
       and stressed at the time and that he had not mentioned it because  he
       did not believe it to be relevant. It accepted the  explanation  that
       FS had thought he was only being asked about  events  in  Iran.   The
       appeal was allowed.

    9. Nothing in the determination, nor record of  proceedings,  gives  any
       indication that s85(5) or (6) of the NIAA 2002 were raised by  either
       party, nor considered by the Tribunal.

       The Challenge

   10. The Secretary of State for the Home Department submits that the First-
       tier Tribunal decision is flawed for the following material errors in
       approach:

             i) Unfairness. The  Secretary  of  State  had  good  reason  to
                request and  adjournment  and  its  refusal  prejudiced  her
                ability to properly prosecute her case. reliance  is  placed
                on Ngaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418;

            ii) The claimed conversion was plainly a  'new  matter'  falling
                within the ambit of s85 NIAA 2002 and as such  the  Tribunal
                had no jurisdiction to proceed without the  consent  of  the
                Secretary of State. The decision is therefore a nullity.

       The Defence

   11. Mr Eaton resisted the appeal on all grounds.   He submitted that  the
       conversion was not a 'new  matter'.  It  was  a  development  of  the
       factual matrix of the claim, but it was a not a  new  issue:  FS  had
       clearly expressed his antipathy towards Islam  whilst  in  Iran,  and
       signalled that he was interested in exploring  other  faiths  by  his
       possession of a bible. His conversion was therefore to be regarded as
       part of the same continuum.

   12. As to the adjournment he submitted that the Tribunal dealt  with  the
       matter fairly and with regard to  the  overriding  objective  of  the
       expeditious disposal of appeals. The HOPO  was  given  the  necessary
       time to read the bundle and make enquiries.  There was  therefore  no
       prejudice to her position nor, fairly, her  ability  to  present  her
       case.

       Discussion and Findings

   13. I heard submissions from both parties at the hearing in December.  On
       the 16th January 2018 I invited further submissions in light  of  the
       decision in Mahmud.   I have received no further submissions, nor any
       request to reconvene the hearing. I therefore  proceed  to  determine
       the appeal before me applying the principles set out in the  reported
       decision of Mahmud.

   14. The fact that the grounds  challenge  this  decision  on  two  fronts
       perhaps illustrates the limited utility of the new powers in s85.  If
       the mischief that parliament intended to remedy  is  the  unannounced
       appellate ambush, it is apparent from the  grounds,  and  indeed  the
       conduct of the Presenting Officer  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
       that it has always been open to the  Secretary  of  State  to  simply
       apply for an adjournment (or indeed to withdraw  the  decision  under
       appeal): see the commentary of the Presidential panel in Quaidoo (new
       matter: procedure/process) [2018] UKUT 00087 (IAC).  In this  case  I
       am however satisfied that the Secretary of State has  made  out  both
       limbs to her challenge.  I am satisfied that it was manifestly unfair
       that the First-tier Tribunal did not adjourn the appeal. I am further
       satisfied that the Tribunal erred  in  not  considering  whether  the
       conversion was a 'new matter'. Had  its  asked  itself  the  question
       there can be  little  doubt  that  it  would  have  answered  in  the
       affirmative.

   15. The operative part of Part V is the amended section 85:

           (1)   An appeal under section 82(1) against the  decision  shall
                be treated by the Tribunal as including  an  appeal  against
                any decision in respect of which the appellant has  a  right
                of appeal under section 82(1).

           (2)   If an appellant under  section  82(1)  makes  a  statement
                under section 120, the Tribunal shall  consider  any  matter
                raised in a statement which constitutes a ground  of  appeal
                of a  kind  listed  in  section  84  the  decision  appealed
                against.

           (3)   Subsection (2) applies to a statement made  under  section
                120 whether the statement  was  made  before  or  after  the
                appeal was commenced.

           (4)   On an appeal under section 82(1) ...  against  a  decision
                the Tribunal may consider...  any  matter  which  it  thinks
                relevant to the substance of the  decision,  including...  a
                matter arising after the date of decision.

           (5)   But the Tribunal must not consider a new matter unless the
                Secretary of Status has given the Tribunal consent to do so.

           (6)   A matter is a "new matter" if -

                (a)    it constitutes a ground of appeal of a kind listed in
                    section 84, and

                (b)    the Secretary of State has not previously  considered
                    the matter in the context of -

                    (i)      the decision mentioned in section 82(1), or

                    (ii)     a statement made by the appellant under section
                        120.

   16. In considering what a 'new matter' might be  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
       Mahmud held:

             1. Whether something is or is not a 'new matter'  goes  to  the
                jurisdiction of the First-tier Tribunal in  the  appeal  and
                the First-tier Tribunal must therefore determine for  itself
                the issue.

             2. A 'new matter' is a matter which  constitutes  a  ground  of
                appeal of a kind  listed  in  section  84,  as  required  by
                section 85(6)(a) of the 2002 Act.  Constituting a ground  of
                appeal means that it must contain a matter which could raise
                or establish a listed ground of appeal.   A  matter  is  the
                factual substance of a claim.  A ground  of  appeal  is  the
                legal basis on which the facts in  any  given  matter  could
                form the basis of a challenge to the decision under appeal.

             3. In practice, a new matter is a factual matrix which has  not
                previously been considered by the Secretary of State in  the
                context of the decision in section 82(1) or a statement made
                by the appellant  under  section  120.   This  requires  the
                matter to be factually distinct from that previously  raised
                by an appellant, as opposed to further or better evidence of
                an existing matter.  The  assessment  will  always  be  fact
                sensitive.

   17. By any reckoning, the conversion to Christianity was an entirely  new
       matter that the Secretary of State had not considered. True, it might
       be argued that she could have been alerted to the new element of  the
       case in February 2017 when FS indicated, at the CMR, that  he  wished
       to call an ordained minister as a witness in his appeal. It  was  not
       however clear at that stage what the evidence  would  be.  The  first
       real notice came with the lodging of the appeal bundles; for whatever
       reason the HOPO did not receive his until the day of the hearing.  It
       quite plainly prejudiced his ability to put the Secretary of  State's
       case. She had not had the chance to test FS's knowledge, nor  conduct
       the relevant  background  checks  on  the  witnesses.   Applying  the
       approach in Mahmud, it was a factually distinct matter from the claim
       as previously put. The Tribunal should have declared the issue a 'new
       matter' and sought the Secretary of State's consent.

   18. Mr Eaton submitted  in  defence  of  the  decision  that  the  formal
       conversion to Christianity was part of  a  'natural  progression'  in
       FS's case. He had on arrival  indicated  that  he  had  been  feeling
       ambivalent about Islam for some time, and that this had progressed to
       full-scale disenchantment. He had been in possession of a  bible  and
       this had been found by the authorities when they had raided his home.
       He had travelled across Europe in the company of M. That he had  then
       started attending church, and had been baptised, was simply a factual
       development. Had Mahmud been available to Mr Eaton at the hearing, he
       might have employed its  phrase:  it  was  "further  evidence  of  an
       existing matter".

   19. I am unable, on the facts,  to  accept  that  interpretation  of  the
       evidence. Whilst all the points made by Mr Eaton about the historical
       case are true, they are not the whole picture. Much of  the  evidence
       adduced prior to the refusal would  tend  to  indicate  that  FS  had
       become disillusioned with religion in general.  His evidence  on  his
       study  of  psychiatry,  Neuro-Linguistic  Programming  and   'Erikson
       hypnotism' indicated that he had  come  to  question  the  nature  of
       'truth' as it is portrayed in theology as a whole.  At  an  interview
       in  August  2016  FS  expressly  denied  having  converted   to   any
       alternative religion.    The HOPO  could  not  reasonably  have  been
       expected to anticipate from this the 'factual development'  of  full-
       scale conversion to Christianity.   I would add that the  failure  of
       FS to declare  his  baptism  when  directly  asked  the  question  at
       interview gave added impetus to the need to adjourn.  The  Tribunal's
       conclusion that it was unlikely that the Secretary of State would re-
       interview was not, in the circumstances,  one for it to draw.

       Decisions and Directions

   20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of  law  such
       that the decision must be set aside.

   21. The decision in the appeal  is  to  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal for hearing de novo.

   22. Since I have found the claimed conversion to be  a  'new  matter'  it
       would be helpful if the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
       could use the hiatus between this  decision,  and  the  matter  being
       relisted in the First-tier Tribunal, to consider  the  new  evidence,
       whether she wishes  to  interview  the  Appellant,  and  whether  her
       decision is to maintained.

   23. There is an order for anonymity.
