                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Pickup,  promulgated  on  23  October  2018,  following  a  hearing  at
    Manchester on 9th October 2018.  In the decision, the  judge  dismissed
    the appeal of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the  Appellant  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, was born on 2nd April 1938, and
    is a female.  She appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent,
    Entry  Clearance  Officer,  dated  20th  April  2018,  to  refuse   her
    application to come to the UK as the spouse of a Mr Mohammed Sabir, who
    is a British citizen resident in the UK.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim, rests on her  ability,  under  E-
    ECP.3.1. to 3.4. of Appendix FM, to demonstrate that she is exempt from
    the minimum  income  threshold  requirement,  on  the  basis  that  her
    sponsoring husband, is in receipt of Attendance Allowance.  She  wished
    to come and join her husband because this is a  case  whereby  she  had
    originally been in the UK with her husband, who she was now seeking  to
    rejoin.  She is 80 years of age and her husband is 82 years of age.  He
    is seriously ill, bedridden, an  amputee,  and  unable  to  attend  the
    hearing.  She had come to the UK as his spouse but lived  for  a  short
    period of time, only to return back to Pakistan to  care  for  her  ill
    mother-in-law.  She had made a few applications in recent years to come
    to the UK on a visit, but had been refused  each  time.   She  was  now
    apprehensive because given her husband's illness and her fears for  the
    length of time he was going to live, and wanted to care  for  him,  and
    had applied for a spousal's entry clearance, which had been refused  on
    financial grounds.

 4. Although she claimed that  she  was  exempt  from  the  minimum  income
    threshold requirement,  given  that  the  Sponsor  was  in  receipt  of
    Attendance Allowance, Appendix FM-SE specified that this must be proved
    by:-

      a) official documentation from the DWP confirming the entitlement  and
         the amount received, and

      b) at least one personal bank statement from the twelve  month  period
         prior to the date of application showing payment of the  amount  of
         the benefit or allowance in the recipient's bank account.

    The judge held that whilst the DWP  evidence  had  been  produced,  the
    NatWest Bank statements did  not  show  the  allowance  paid  into  the
    Sponsor's bank account.  This is because the amount was paid  into  his
    daughter's account.

 5. The Appellant argues that there is evidence  from  the  DWP  of  income
    relating to the Sponsor, being received into  his  daughter's  account,
    and rental income from  the  Sponsor  going  directly  into  his  son's
    account.  His pension income has been accepted.  The son  and  daughter
    are clear that the amounts that they are receiving are those  of  their
    father.  They receive them because due to his mobility being restricted
    there are issues of his being able to easily receive these amounts.

The Judge's Findings

 6. The judge held that the Appellant could not succeed  because,  although
    it was the case that, "In reality, very little of the essential factual
    evidence is in dispute" (paragraph 14),  the  fact  remained  that  the
    Sponsor's income was paid into the son's bank  account  (paragraph  15)
    and that the father's Attendance Allowance  goes  into  his  daughter's
    account (paragraph 16).  Although this is an  arrangement  said  to  be
    agreed with the DWP, "there is no evidence to confirm that".   The  DWP
    letters in the bundle confirm only that the Sponsor is entitled to  the
    Attendance Allowance; "nothing indicates to which account it  is  paid"
    (paragraph 16).

 7. The judge went on to conclude that he could  not  accept  the  argument
    that Appendix FM-SE l(m) "can cover these unusual circumstances", where
    it was argued that paragraph l(m) of FM-SE is to the effect that,  "(m)
    Cash income on which the correct tax has been paid may  be  counted  as
    income  under  this  Appendix,  subject  to  the  relevant   evidential
    requirements of this  Appendix"  (see  paragraph  11  of  the  skeleton
    argument before the First-tier Tribunal).  The judge's  reasoning  here
    was that, as far as the Sponsor is concerned:-

         "he is not receiving a cash income  and  in  any  event,  it  still
         requires the cash to be deposited in an  account  in  the  person's
         name.  Merely asserting some form of cash income is not sufficient"
         (paragraph 21).

Grounds of Application

 8. The Grounds of Application state that the judge had  erred  in  law  in
    misconstruing  the  relevant  statutory  provisions.   In  relation  to
    evidencing the financial requirements in Appendix FM-SE,  the  "general
    provisions" that were said to apply included l(m),  which  was  to  the
    effect that, "cash income on which the correct tax has been paid may be
    counted  as  income  under  this  Appendix,  subject  to  the  relevant
    evidential requirements of this Appendix".  It  was  argued  that  soon
    after the introduction of Appendix FM in 2012, changes were  then  made
    in paragraph l(m) inserted by HC 1739 on 21st March  2013,  to  include
    the words that "to confirm that cash income on which  the  correct  tax
    has been paid may be counted as income".

 9. Indeed, the new changes in paragraph 1, were inserted under the heading
    of "General Provisions" to apply all over the  Rules.   If  income  was
    received in some other account then the bank statement  of  such  other
    account would be relevant evidence that could be  properly  taken  into
    account.  In the instant case, the earnings that were not  accepted  by
    the Respondent and then also by Judge Pickup,  were  better  than  cash
    payments because they were received in bank accounts of  the  Sponsor's
    son and the daughter respectively for rent of commercial  property  and
    for Attendance Allowance from the DWP.  It was not correct  that  there
    were no DWP confirmations in this respect because the letter  from  the
    DWP  (see  pages  119  to  123  of  the  Appellant's  bundle)   clearly
    demonstrated that the Sponsor's income remained his income, even if  it
    had not been received in his own bank account.

10. Finally, this was a case where there was a couple of 80 and 82 years of
    age, the Sponsor was on his death bed;  the  Appellant  had  previously
    lived with the Sponsor in  the  UK  as  a  spouse;  the  Sponsor  owned
    residential and  commercial  properties;  the  Sponsor  had  access  to
    �52,483.00 in his savings,  and  annual  earnings  of  �20,252.00;  the
    Sponsor  had  support  from  family  members,  and  that   there   were
    exceptional circumstances.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  4th
    December 2018 on the basis that this was a case where the Appellant was
    seeking to rejoin a British citizen Sponsor who was aged 82, where both
    the parties were in poor health, and the unchallenged evidence was that
    the  Sponsor  presented  with   "significant   morbidity   which   will
    deteriorate with age" (paragraph 18).  Moreover, the Supreme Court  had
    made it clear in MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10, that reference  to  other
    sources of income could fall for  consideration  to  meet  the  minimum
    income rule.  The genuine basis of the parties' marriage was not  under
    challenge.  Having accepted the husband's significant morbidity, it was
    not open to the judge to state that the circumstances of  their  living
    apart for many years was "one of their own making and  choice"  because
    this arguably disclosed "a poverty of understanding  of  the  decisions
    that family members make over the course of their lives", but one which
    "with  the  advancement  of  age"  and  the   "likely   vulnerabilities
    increase", such that there could be "unjustifiably harsh  consequences"
    in keeping them separate.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on 3rd April 2019, Mr Salam, relied  upon  the
    Grounds of Application.  He submitted that he had taken the opportunity
    to  discuss  the  appeal  with  Mr  McVeety,  the  Senior  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer, and that he was in agreement that there was  indeed
    an error of law in this decision by the judge, because he had failed to
    proceed on the basis that this was a case  where  the  Sponsor  was  in
    receipt of Attendance Allowance, and  therefore  was  exempt  from  the
    �18,600.00 threshold (see Appendix FM, Section E-ECP.3.3.(a)(iv)).

13. Second, and in any event, he was earning more than �20,000.00 from  his
    rental income and the Attendance Allowance.  The judge did  not  accept
    the rental income, but was wrong to not accept it, on the basis that it
    was going into the son and daughter's bank accounts respectively.   The
    reason however, given for this was that  the  Sponsor  was  unwell  and
    bedridden and needed his children to receive  the  money.   The  letter
    from the DWP demonstrated that the Sponsor was entitled  to  �83.10  as
    Attendance Allowance (and this appears at page 119 of  the  Appellant's
    bundle).  The rental from the commercial property in the Sponsor's name
    (see pages 136 to 150), showed that he was earning �200.00 per week  as
    rental income from a commercial property in Bolton.

14. When this was combined with the  Attendance  Allowance  of  �83.10  per
    week, he was receiving a total of �283.10 per week, which after payment
    of council tax of �21.80, meant that he was  left  with  a  balance  of
    �261.30, which exceeded the required amount of �243.25, even if he  was
    to be subject to the  �18,600.00  financial  threshold,  which  he  was
    actually not to be subjected to.  The judge was wrong to have taken the
    view that tax was not being paid on the  cash  income.   It  was  being
    paid.  In addition, the Sponsor had  savings of �52,483.78,  for  which
    there had been a bank statement at page 111 of the Appellant's  bundle.



15. For his part, Mr McVeety submitted that he could only agree,  and  that
    he would simply draw attention to the fact that  MM  (Lebanon)  allowed
    for a less strict interpretation of the  Rules  when  they  were  first
    drafted, and that the judge  had  erred  in  applying  to  restrict  an
    approach.

Remaking the Decision

16. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the reasons that  have  been  put
    forward by Mr Salam, and agreed upon by Mr McVeety.  There is no bar to
    the Sponsor's income being received by either his son or his  daughter.
    This is a case where the Sponsor in fact has  �52,482.78  in  his  bank
    account (see page 111 of the Appellant's  bundle)  and  his  income  is
    �20,252.00 per annum from pension, Attendance Allowance and rent.   His
    son and daughter have lived with the Sponsor in  a  large  six  bedroom
    house that is owned by the Sponsor.  The Supreme Court in MM  (Lebanon)
    drew  attention  to  the  fact  that   compelling   and   compassionate
    circumstances of the couple should be taken  into  account.   Paragraph
    I(m) of Appendix FM-SE makes it clear that cash income  is  acceptable,
    and that receiving cash income in one's  own  bank  account  is  not  a
    mandatory requirement, and in this case there are perfectly supportable
    reasons for why this particular Sponsor is not  receiving  that  income
    into his own account.  There is indeed a letter from the DWP (pages 119
    to 123 of the Appellant's bundle) that provides proof of the  Sponsor's
    income.  I also have a Halifax Bank statement from the  Sponsor  handed
    up to me, which is dated 11th January  2018,  that  confirms  that  the
    Sponsor had �52,483.78 in his own  bank  account.   On  any  view,  the
    Appellant has satisfied the burden of proof that  is  upon  him.   This
    appeal is accordingly allowed.

Notice of Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  I set aside the decision of the original judge.   I
    remake the decision as follows.  This appeal is allowed.

18. No anonymity direction is made.

19. The Appellant's appeal is allowed.
