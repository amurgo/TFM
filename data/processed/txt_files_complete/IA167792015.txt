                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant Secretary of State appeals the decision  of  Judge  Flynn
    promulgated in the First-tier Tribunal on 24th June 2016.  Judge  Flynn
    allowed this Eritrean citizen's  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  the
    Secretary of  State,  dated  4th  April  2015,  to  issue  a  permanent
    residence  card  under  Regulation  15  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 2. Claimant and Appeal proceedings

 3. The background was not significantly disputed. Credibility was  not  in
    issue, and there was no suggestion that the  Claimant  or  her  Sponsor
    have acted or sought to abuse the EEA provisions.

 4. The Claimant married her German national sponsor  in  Eritrea  in  June
    2006. The Claimant could not leave at  the  time  because  of  national
    service obligations. The Claimant entered the UK in 2008. On 08 October
    2009 the Claimant was issued with a family member residence card  valid
    for five years i.e. until 2014. The couple lived  together  in  the  UK
    between 2008 and 2010 in an on off relationship. The  Sponsor  returned
    to Germany in May 2010 and the couple separated. They did not  divorce.
    In 2013 the Claimant went to Germany, and saw  the  Sponsor.  In  March
    2013 the Sponsor returned to the UK, having enrolled  on  a  four  year
    course at the University of Central  Lancaster.  He  had  a  term  time
    address in Preston and his permanent address was that of  the  Claimant
    in London.  The  University  course  incorporated  a  one-year  foreign
    student  exchange  programme.  The  EEA  national  went  to   Thammasat
    University in Thailand for one year from August 2015 to May 2016.

 5. On 18 December 2014 the Claimant, in person, applied  for  a  permanent
    residence card and completed an EEA4 application  referencing  her  own
    exercise of treaty  rights  for  a  period  of  over  five  years.  The
    application stated that it was the  Claimant  who  was  supporting  her
    husband financially since his job ended in 2010 and the  start  of  his
    University course in 2013.

 6. On 24 April 2015 the Claimant's application for a  permanent  residence
    card was refused.  The  Secretary  of  State  had  concluded  that  the
    Claimant had failed to provide  evidence  that  her  EEA  national  had
    resided in the United Kingdom in accordance with the Regulations for  a
    five-year period.  The evidence submitted was thought  insufficient  to
    establish that the Sponsor was resident in the UK between 2010 and 2013
    in accordance with the Regulations, or  that  he  has  been  exercising
    treaty rights in the UK from 2013 to the date of decision. The evidence
    of the Claimant's employment during that time  was  not  sufficient  to
    show the exercise of treaty tights by the EEA national.  The  Secretary
    of State concludes that the Claimant had not shown  that  she  had  any
    basis of stay in the United Kingdom under the Regulations.

 7. The Claimant appealed on the grounds that even though the Secretary  of
    State was right that her EEA Sponsor had  not  been  exercising  treaty
    rights between 2008 and 2013, following his return to the UK in 2013 as
    a student he was doing so, including at the time of the application and
    decision, so that the Claimant had established an entitlement to reside
    as a family member so that an ordinary residence card should have  been
    issued.

 8. The hearing in the Ft-T tribunal

 9. The matter came before Judge Flynn on 2nd June 2016, when both  parties
    were represented.  Mr Alim for the Complainant reiterated  the  grounds
    of appeal, conceding that the Claimant did not meet the requirement for
    a permanent residence card but had shown that she did have a  right  to
    an ordinary residence card as a family member of an EEA  national  with
    reference to Regulation 7 and Regulation 14.

10. The Home Office Presenting Officer submitted that as  it  was  conceded
    the Claimant  was  not  entitled  to  a  residence  card  reflecting  a
    permanent right of residence, that was sufficient  to  dispose  of  the
    appeal, it was not for the judge to decide whether  she  had  a  lesser
    right of residence,  as  the  application  was  only  for  a  permanent
    residence card. In the alternative the Secretary of State  had  in  any
    event been correct when asserting that the Sponsor was  not  exercising
    treaty rights in the UK because cross examination had revealed that the
    sponsor was now absent from the UK, and so not a qualified person under
    Regulation  6.  The  Claimant  could  not  be  a  family  member  under
    Regulation 7. The up to date evidence of insurance for 2015 to 2016 was
    not relevant because it post-dated the decision.

11. Mr Alim submitted that the late production of the evidence of insurance
    was nonetheless sufficient, and  that  the  evidence  showed  that  the
    Sponsor was a student for the purposes of Regulation 6.  With regard to
    the Claimant's presence in  the  United  Kingdom  he  argued  that  the
    reference to a Sponsor being in the United Kingdom in Regulation 6  was
    not determinative.  The definition of student referred to enrolment  on
    a  course  rather  than  being  present.   The  Claimant's  Sponsor  'e
    enrolment was from 2013 to 2017 and so  included  the  period  2015  to
    2016, i.e. specifically covered the date of decision.   The  fact  that
    the Claimant was out of the country was irrelevant,  as  was  shown  by
    Article 11 concerning the validity of residence  cards,  to  the  point
    that it is valid  for  five  years  from  the  date  of  issue  and  is
    unaffected by one absence of a maximum of twelve consecutive months for
    study or vocational  training  in  a  third  country.   Further,  under
    Article  16  concerning  the  entitlement  to  a  permanent  right   of
    residence, the necessary five years' continuous residence is  similarly
    stated not to be affected by such a single absence.

12. Judge Flynn's decision

13. Judge Flynn found that the Secretary  of  State  had  been  correct  to
    identify that the five years' residence exercising treaty rights  prior
    to the application needed to be that of the EEA Sponsor  and  not  just
    the Claimant, and as she could not establish the required five years UK
    residence of her Sponsor in light of his being in Germany between  2010
    and 2013, the refusal to issue a permanent residence card was correct.

14. Judge Flynn decided  that  the  2014  insurance  certificate  had  been
    submitted with the application and that although no policy was attached
    the certificate covered  the  date  of  application  and  decision  and
    evidence sufficient scope of provision to meet the requirements for EEA
    students  and  family  members.  Further  the  fact  that  the  current
    insurance document for 2015 2016  was  not  provided  until  after  the
    decision did not matter  following  the  case  of  Boodhoo  (EEA  Regs:
    relevant evidence) [2013] UKUT 346 relevant post decision evidence  was
    permitted.

15. Judge Flynn concluded that the evidence established  that  the  Sponsor
    was a family member of an EEA national qualified person at the date  of
    application in December 2014, and as at the date of decision  in  April
    2015, so that the refusal to issue a residence card was wrong.

16. Judge Flynn decided that the Claimant's continuing right  of  residence
    as a family member of an EEA student was not affected by  the  fact  of
    the EEA national subsequently going abroad for the third  year  of  the
    degree course i.e. August 2015 to May 2016, and so absent at  the  time
    of the hearing in June 2016. He was fortified in that approach  because
    of the Regulations  which  discount  such  a  period  when  considering
    continuity of residence for the purposes of  entitlement  to  permanent
    residence cards.

17. Permission application and Rule 24 response

18.  On  26th  October  2016  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ransley  granted
    permission to appeal on the grounds, namely that it was  arguable  that
    the  judge  misinterpreted  the  EEA  Regulations  to  the  point  that
    Regulation 6(1) required the qualified  person  to  be  in  the  United
    Kingdom and that any latitude  in  the  calculation  of  continuity  of
    residence for the purposes of  assessing  entitlement  to  a  permanent
    residence card  was  not  relevant  outside  of  that  context  and  in
    particular does not apply to students, it should not have been  applied
    by the judge when making an assessment in  respect  of  Regulation  14.
    Permission was  not  granted  on  the  ground  that  the  Claimant  was
    precluded from arguing an entitlement to a residence card  because  she
    had only made an application for a permanent residence card.  That must
    be right in any event because as the decision makes clear the Secretary
    of  State  did  consider  whether  or  not  she  was  entitled  to  any
    alternative form of residence and concluded that she was  not,  to  the
    point that the issue was live.

19. The Claimant responds in a Rule 24 notice that when Regulation 6 states
    that the qualified person should be "in the United Kingdom" it does not
    accurately reflect the Directive. Further in the Directive at  Articles
    11(3) and 15(3) it is set out that a one-off twelve-month  period  does
    not affect either the validity of an issued family  residence  card  or
    the calculation of  continuity  of  residence  in  the  context  of  an
    application for a permanent residence.  In  those  circumstances  logic
    dictates that if an absence does not  affect  the  right  to  permanent
    residence it cannot affect the right to reside.  In  the  circumstances
    it is clear from the Directive that an  absence  does  not  affect  the
    right to reside, to the point that insofar as the  Regulations  do  not
    match  the  Directive  the  Tribunal  should  implement  the  Directive
    'directly'.

20. Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

21. There was  an  unopposed  application  to  adduce  a  letter  from  the
    University of Central Lancashire dated 2nd April 2015 to the point that
    the German Sponsor who was spending one full academic year at Thammasat
    University, Thailand on an agreed exchange programme and that the  year
    would count in full to his degree programme in the United  Kingdom,  as
    well as a letter  from  Thammasat  University  dated  10th  April  2015
    confirming the Claimant's place at the university between  August  2015
    to May 2016.  The matter has not been in significant dispute, Mr  Avery
    made no objections to my taking those two letters into account.

22. In addition, I had the Secretary of State's bundle of 26th January 2016
    which was before the First-tier Tribunal,  along  with  the  Claimant's
    bundle  dated  23rd  May  2016,  the  application  for,  and  grant  of
    permission, the Rule 24 response.

23. The representatives relied on the grounds and response to which I  have
    referred.

24. Mr Avery pointed out that the claimant's EEA spouse had  not  exercised
    treaty rights in the United Kingdom because although  he  had  come  in
    2013 to enrol on the course at Lancaster as shown by the correspondence
    admitted by the Claimant at the hearing before  me,  and  although  the
    course ran from 2013 to 2017, the evidence was that as at the  date  of
    application i.e. December 2014 he did not have in  place  comprehensive
    sickness insurance.  The sickness insurance only ran from December 2015
    to December 2016.  Accordingly, when the Claimant was in  fact  in  the
    United Kingdom between 2013 and August 2015, i.e. prior to his going to
    Thailand for a year, he did not have comprehensive  sickness  insurance
    and could not be said to be exercising treaty rights as a result of its
    absence.  If he was never exercising treaty rights here, then issues of
    continuity could not be relevant.

25. I find that this new point did not  assist  the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal. It was not argued below and no error of law can flow  from  it.
    In any event the reasoning I give  below  resolving  the  dispute  upon
    which permission was granted reveals it is without merit.

26. Mr Alim argued that that 2015 2016 insurance certificate  was  relevant
    to the date of hearing before the judge, i.e. June  2016,  and  as  the
    insurance was in place and at that time he was enrolled in a course  in
    the United Kingdom, and  had  the  benefit  of  comprehensive  sickness
    insurance extending to cover his family  member,  he  was  therefore  a
    qualified person and the Claimant had a right of residence.

Discussion

Undisputed Facts

27. The Claimant is an Eritrean national born on  8th  February  1982.   On
    16th October 2008 she  entered  the  United  Kingdom.  As  shown  by  a
    marriage certificate from Eritrea dated 21st June 2006 the  couple  had
    undergone a customary marriage on 14th June 2006.  In  a  letter  dated
    17th August 2006 the Eritrean Consulate in Frankfurt confirmed that the
    marriage was recognised in accordance with Eritrean law.

28. On 18th December 2014 the Claimant applied for  a  permanent  residence
    card on an EEA 4 form designated for such. The Application stated  that
    the EEA Sponsor was living at the  same  address  as  the  Claimant  in
    London; the EEA Sponsor exercised treaty rights  as  a  worker  between
    2008 and 2010, and as a student from February 2013  and  continuing  to
    June 2017; the Claimant had been in the UK for 6 years and 2 months and
    worked throughout, financially supporting her husband.

29. The application and supporting documents are at A-L of the Secretary of
    State's bundle. The application is shown  to  have  been  supported  by
    evidence  of  the  Sponsor's  German  nationality,  of  the   marriage,
    confirmation  from  the  University  of  Central  Lancashire  that  the
    Claimant had been enrolled on a BA (Hons) International Business course
    which commenced on 16th September 2013 and was  expected  to  cease  on
    26th May 2017 (D1).

30. For the EEA national there was evidence of earning in the tax year 2008
    to 2009 at Burger King, by way of a payslip and  P60,  showing  he  had
    achieved a salary of �8,544, there were payslips for the tax year  2009
    to 2010, dated 5th January 2010, also reflecting employment with Burger
    King, with taxable pay to date of �2,585.20, and,  for  March  of  that
    year, employment with EMS Research Ltd, with gross pay of �1000 for the
    month and his  Burger King payslip for April 2010  with a pay  to  date
    of �712.77.  There were his bank  statements  at  an  address  that  he
    maintained in Lancaster for 2009/10.

31.  For the Claimant there were bank statements for the address in  London
    for 2014. There was confirmation of her employment:  at McDonalds since
    26th November 2009 evidenced by P60s for 2009/10,  reflecting  earnings
    of �2,802.69; for 2012 earnings of  �9,774.95;  for  2013  earnings  of
    �12,593.99, for 2014 earnings of �10,498.22.   There  was  evidence  of
    additional earnings from Young and Co's Brewery  PLC  showing  earnings
    for the year ending  2011  of  �4,360.73,  for  the  year  ending  2012
    �4,229.73, of the year ending 2014 of �2,921.81.

32. There was a certificate of comprehensive insurance  from  Freedom  (E1)
    evidencing that that the EEA national and his partner were covered  for
    the period 18th December 2014 to 18th December 2015.

33. The Claimant's statement in support of her appeal gives  the  following
    information.  The Claimant married the EEA national  on  14th  June  in
    2006 in Eritrea.  The EEA national had been working with the claimant's
    sister in Germany.  The couple lived together in Eritrea for one month.
     The Claimant was not allowed to leave Eritrea due to national service.
     The Claimant applied for entry clearance and although it was initially
    refused it was subsequently granted following her  husband's  visit  to
    her in Uganda to which country at some point she had  moved.   On  16th
    October 2008 the Claimant arrived in the United Kingdom (the  inference
    is with entry clearance).  The couple lived  together  until  May  2010
    when the EEA Sponsor decided to move back to Germany.  The couple  have
    not lived together since May 2010 and the relationship has been on  and
    off.  The Claimant went to Germany in 2013 and saw the EEA  Sponsor  at
    her sister's, with whom he remains friendly.  In 2013 the  EEA  Sponsor
    returned to the UK to study at the University of Central Lancashire  on
    a three year course with a one-year foundation course.

34. There couple are still  married,  as  confirmed  by  an  email  in  the
    Appellant's bundle dated 17th May 2016 from the EEA national, in  which
    he also confirms that there are no divorce proceedings.

35. In the appeal bundle there is a second insurance  certificate  covering
    the period December 2015 to 2016.

36. The Dispute in the Upper Tribunal

37. The issue is whether or not the family member of an EEA national  loses
    the right to reside when her EEA sponsor leaves the UK on  a  temporary
    basis because the EEA national is no longer a  qualified  person  under
    EEA Regulation 6. The regulations in force at the time  of  the  First-
    tier hearing are the 2006 regulations.

38. Regulation 6(1) states:

         "Qualified person

         6(1)     In these Regulations, 'qualified person' means a person
             who is an EEA national and in the United Kingdom as -

             (a)  a jobseeker;

             (b)  a worker;

             (c)  a self-employed person;

             (d)  a self-sufficient person; or

             (e)  a student

         (2)  Not applicable

         (3)  Not applicable

         (4)  Not applicable

39. Regulation 14 states in its relevant part:

         "Extended right of residence

         14(1)    A qualified person is entitled to reside in the United
             Kingdom for so long as he remains a qualified person.

         (2)  A family member of a qualified person residing in the United
             Kingdom under paragraph (12) or of an EEA national with a
             permanent right of residence under regulation 15 is entitled
             to reside in the United Kingdom for so long as he remains the
             family member of the qualified person or EEA national.

         (3)  Not applicable.

         (4)  Not applicable.

         (5)  Not applicable."

40. Regulation 15 sets out who  has  a  permanent  right  of  residence  as
    follows:

         "Permanent right of residence

         15(1)    The following persons shall acquire the right to reside in
             the United Kingdom permanently-

             (a)  an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom in
                  accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period
                  of five years;

             (b)  a family member of an EEA national who is not himself an
                  EEA national but who has resided in the United Kingdom
                  with the EEA national in accordance with these Regulations
                  for a continuous period of five years;

             (c)  not applicable;

             (d)  not applicable;

             (e)  not applicable;

             (f)  not applicable;

41. In respect of continuity of residence  Regulation  3  in  its  relevant
    parts provides:

         "Continuity of residence

         3(1)     This regulation applies for the purpose of calculating
             periods of continuous residence in the United Kingdom under
             regulation 5(1) and regulation 15.

         (2)  Continuity of residence is not affected by -

             (a)  periods of absence from the United Kingdom which do not
                  exceed six months in total in any year;

             (b)  periods of absence from the United Kingdom on military
                  service; or

             (c)  any one absence from the United Kingdom not exceeding
                  twelve months for an important reason such as pregnancy
                  and childbirth, serious illness, study or vocational
                  training or an overseas posting.

         (3)  Not applicable."

42. The definition of a student is set out at Regulation 4 which states  in
    its relevant part as follows:

         "'Worker', 'self-employed person', 'self-sufficient person' and
         'student'

         4(1)     In these Regulations -

         (a)  'worker' means a worker within the meaning of Article 45 of
             the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;

         (b)  'self-employed person' means a person who establishes himself
             in order to pursue activity as a self-employed person in
             accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of
             the European Union;

         (c)  'self-sufficient person' means a person who has-

             (i)  sufficient resources not to become a burden on the social
                  assistance system of the United Kingdom during his period
                  of residence; and

             (ii) comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the United
                  Kingdom;

         (d)  'student' means a person who-

             (i)  is enrolled, for the principal purpose of following a
                  course of study (including vocational training), at a

43. Discussion

44. Regulation 6 set out above, defines qualified people as  EEA  nationals
    "in  the  UK  as  ".  The  Regulations  do  not  provide  any   further
    explanation.

45. The narrow interpretation argued for by the Secretary of State is  that
    it requires the EEA national to be physically present to be a qualified
    person.

46. The broader interpretation argued for by the Claimant is that it  means
    the EEA national only need be  resident  in  the  UK.  Whilst  physical
    presence is  necessary  to  establish  residence  it  is  not  required
    throughout residence.

47. The requirement "in the UK as" is followed by a list  of  the  relevant
    purposes of residence. That structure makes it apparent that the rights
    attach to or follow the purpose of residence.

48. It is self-evident that in the context of absence from the UK  the  EEA
    national does not lose  a  previously  established  extended  right  to
    reside, but, having left, is  simply  not  exercising  the  right,  and
    exercises the right on re-entry.

49. Do they remain a qualified person?

50. Elsewhere in the regulations there is clear emphasis on  the  requiring
    that the EEA national should be residing here.

51. Regulation 10 deals with the  position  of  retained  rights  of  adult
    family members on death/divorce of the EEA national, and of children of
    an EEA national who "ceased to be a  qualified  person  on  ceasing  to
    reside" in the UK.

52. Regulation 12 deal with the issue of family permit on the  basis  of  a
    family member of EEA nationals who are "residing in the UK".

53. Regulation 13 provides  the  initial  right  of  residence  for  family
    members of EEA nationals "residing in the UK".

54. Regulation  14  provides  for  family  members  of  "qualified  persons
    residing in the UK".

55. Regulation 15  sets  out  the  continuous  residence  requirements  for
    permanent residence.  Regulation 6 sets out that breaks  in  continuity
    are not caused by a temporary absence of  up  to  a  year  for  certain
    purposes, including study.

56. Turning to the Citizens Directive, Article 7, in essence, sets out  who
    the relevant persons  are  who  can  benefit  from  extended  residence
    rights. The category  of  person  are  those  EEA  nationals  who  have
    extended rights of residence are those who have jobs or self-employment
    in the host state, or are able to be self-sufficient for the period  of
    their residence, or are students enrolled at accredited  establishments
    in the host state. There is  no  requirement  for  continuous  physical
    presence. The  emphasis  is  all  on  residence,  and  the  purpose  of
    residence.

57. The concept of residence does not preclude temporary absence. Issues of
    residence depend on whether or not when leaving absence is intended  to
    be only temporary. The Directive and  Regulations  clearly  spell  out,
    where continuity of residence is important as the gateway to  permanent
    rights, that absences that extend  beyond  a  relevant  period  can  no
    longer be considered temporary.  Very  specifically  it  is  said,  for
    example at Regulation 3, that a period of established residence is  not
    brought to an end when an EEA student enjoys, on a  one  off  basis,  a
    period of study abroad for a year.

58.  I am satisfied that nothing in the Directive or the Regulations  means
    it would be inconsistent to interpret the words "in the UK" as  meaning
    that the person must be resident here.

59. The purpose of the Regulations is to reflect  the  Citizens  Directive.
    The free movement of EEA  nationals  is  the  imperative.  It  is  well
    understood that the Directive, and Regulations must be  interpreted  so
    as to facilitate free movement of EEA nationals. It is in that  context
    that they have the right to have their family members move  with  them.
    I find that the interpretation argued for by the Secretary of State  in
    this case runs counter to that principle.  Quite  simply  if  qualified
    person status is dependent on physical presence it must mean that it is
    automatically lost on any temporary exit.  The  degree  of  uncertainty
    that that would bring to  the  family  and  private  life  of  the  EEA
    national qualified persons and their family  would  operate  to  fetter
    free movement. Such an interpretation would mean that  the  Regulations
    act as a disincentive. In the context of a  student  exercising  treaty
    rights in order to come to the UK to study on a course  which  has  the
    benefit of a student exchange programme, it would operate to  frustrate
    the very purpose for which the exercise of treaty rights  is  provided.
    It would also mean that the position of the EEA national was worse than
    the position of a British Citizen who took part in such an exchange and
    whose family members' residence rights would be unaffected.

60. EEA Regulation 6 (1) cannot be so literally interpreted.

61. Whilst the  EEA  Regulations,  in  line  with  the  Directive,  do  not
    expressly set out the position of family members in the  event  of  the
    EEA national's temporary absence from  the  host  state,  adopting  the
    purposeful interpretation above, I am satisfied that there is  no  need
    for them to do so because they are unaffected.

62. It is not the Secretary of  State's  case  that  if  the  EEA  national
    remains a qualified person, as I have found to be the case  here,  that
    their absence from the UK for temporary purposes affects  the  position
    of family members enjoying extended residence rights here.

63. Given the interpretation I have adopted I find the Judge was  right  to
    conclude as he did. The fact that the Claimant's  husband  had,  during
    the course of the appeal process, gone abroad to study, and was out  of
    the UK as at the date of hearing, did not mean that  the  Claimant  was
    unable to meet the requirement of her family member being  resident  in
    the UK and so a qualified person.

64. All matters being resolved in the Claimant's favour it follows that she
    is entitled to a residence card as a family member.

Decision

65. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not reveal  any  error  of
    law and the decision allowing  the  Claimant's  appeal  under  the  EEA
    Regulations stands.

No anonymity direction is made.
