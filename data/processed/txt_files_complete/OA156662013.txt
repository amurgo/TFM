                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Raikes, promulgated on 4th August 2014,  in  which  the  Judge
        allowed the appeal against the refusal of an Entry Clearance Officer
        (ECO) dated 27 June 2013 to grant Ms Kaur leave to enter the  United
        Kingdom for the purposes of settlement with her husband and sponsor.
        The application was refused as the  mandatory  requirements  of  the
        Immigration Rules had not been shown to be met.


     2. The sponsor is said to have failed to provide a letter of employment
        from the company he works for with the relevant information required
        by the Rules in it. Dates in relation to cash deposits made did  not
        support those on  payslips  making  it  difficult  for  the  ECO  to
        establish if the cash deposits had  originated  from  the  sponsor's
        employment. The requirement is to demonstrate an income  of  �18,600
        per annum and specified documents had not been provided  in  respect
        of employment leading to the refusal under paragraph EC-P.1.1 (d) of
        Appendix FM.


     3. The Judge considered the evidence made available and noted that  the
        employment relied upon  by  the  sponsor  with  IDTEL  commenced  in
        September 2012 but ended in April 2013.  The  Judge,  however,  also
        found that the  sponsor  had  started  work  with  another  employer
        thereafter and that at the date of decision he was working for  this
        employer. The Judge found that  the  sponsor  also  received  rental
        income and whilst accepting that a lot of  the  evidence  was  post-
        decision concluded that it related to a  situation  appertaining  at
        the date of decision and that it had been proved that the  level  of
        income met the minimum requirements of the  Rules.  The  Judge  also
        states in paragraph 22 that  the  terms  of  paragraph  281  of  the
        Immigration Rules are met even though this is  an  application  made
        under Appendix FM.


     4. The Secretary of State challenges the findings of the Judge allowing
        the appeal under the Rules on the basis of a  material  misdirection
        of law as the Appellant failed to provide mandatory documents as set
        out by the ECO.



Discussion


     5. Appendix FM introduced a prescriptive set of requirements that  need
        to be satisfied by individuals wishing to  succeed  in  applications
        for leave under these provisions.  In relation  to  the  maintenance
        requirement it is necessary for individual such as this Appellant to
        prove they have a minimum gross income available of  �18,600.   This
        requirement has been found to be lawful by the Court of  Appeal  and
        is the level at which the Secretary of State believes  a  burden  on
        the public purse by those entering the country is mitigated.


     6. The Rules contain specified methods by  which  the  availability  of
        such funds can be established. These are set out in  Appendix  FM-SE
        and related guidance. The requirement to provide specified documents
        is a mandatory requirement. The  ECO  found  that  the  sponsor  had
        failed to provide a letter of employment from the company he  worked
        for containing the information required by the Rules which includes:
        (i) the persons employment and gross annual salary; (ii) the  length
        of their employment; (iii) the period over which they have  been  or
        were paid for the level of salary relied upon  in  the  application;
        and (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed term  contract  or
        agency).


     7. In relation to cash deposits it was found these did  not  match  the
        alleged sums paid on the payslips. The requirement of the  Rules  is
        that personal bank statements corresponding to the same  periods  as
        the wage slips must be provided showing that  the  salary  has  been
        paid into an account in the name of the person or in the name of the
        person and their partner jointly.


     8. The reason for such requirements is that it enables a decision maker
        not  only  to  ascertain  whether  the  claimed  income   has   been
        substantiated on the documents but also to enable further checks  to
        be made of those issuing the documents if questions arise. It is not
        enough for an individual to claim they earn the relevant  income  as
        this in itself is open to abuse. They have to prove this claim.


     9. The Judge makes no findings regarding whether an employer letter was
        provided with the application in the required terms. The grounds  of
        appeal and evidence  suggest  that  such  a  letter  may  have  been
        provided by the sponsor to his solicitor but there  is  no  evidence
        that that information was passed to the decision maker  as  part  of
        the application process. As there  is  no  evidence  this  mandatory
        document was provided the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules
        could not be found to have been met.


    10. Similarly, in relation to the cash deposits, the Judge fails to make
        an adequately reasoned analysis of this ground of refusal especially
        in light of the fact that the cash deposits do not  demonstrate  the
        sponsor's claimed income. As such the requirements of Appendix FM-SE
        cannot be met.


    11. The Judge was looking at a decision made on  27  June  2013  on  the
        basis of the documentation provided with  the  application  and  the
        question whether that material satisfied  the  requirements  of  the
        Rules. Consideration of all the available information clearly  shows
        that that information did not meet the mandatory requirements and on
        this basis the appeal should have  been  dismissed.  The  Judge,  in
        fact, went on to consider evidence of a further period of employment
        which would not be known by the  decision  maker  and  applying  the
        'situation appertaining' test appears  to  have  decided  that  that
        permitted  her  to  allow  the  appeal.  The  requirements  of   the
        Immigration Rules are set out in the Rules  and  whatever  may  have
        happened  subsequently  does  not  enable  a  Judge  to  find  those
        requirements could be ignored.   There  is  no  judicial  discretion
        within the Rules or Guidance permitting such a finding to be made.


    12. Article 8 ECHR was also pleaded in the  grounds  and  if  the  Judge
        considered that the Rules could not be met but  that  the  available
        income was such that there would be no burden to the  public  purse,
        it was always open to her to consider whether the appeal should have
        been allowed under Article 8; but  only  when  considering  relevant
        factors and undertaking a proper proportionality exercise as this is
        an element that would need to be considered outside the  Rules.  The
        Judge did not do so however as it was stated that the Appellant  had
        not sought to adduce any evidence in respect of Article 8 and as the
        appeal had been allowed under the Rules. It may be an error  not  to
        consider matters raised in the grounds of  appeal  although  as  the
        Judge allowed the appeal under the Rules there was no  obvious  need
        for her to go further in her mind.


    13. As stated, I find the Judge has materially erred in law in  relation
        to the Immigration Rules such that that element of her decision must
        be set aside. There is no attendance by  the  Appellant  or  sponsor
        today but the tribunal did  receive  a  letter  from  the  Appellant
        acknowledging receipt of the notice of hearing and referring to  the
        appeal being allowed but thereafter the  Secretary  of  State  being
        granted permission to appeal. The letter is dated 25 October 2014 in
        which the Appellant also states "I do not want to contest my  appeal
        application any further".


    14. In terms of substituting a  decision  I  substitute  a  decision  in
        relation to the  Rules  to  dismiss  the  appeal  as  the  mandatory
        requirements of the Rules were not met by the material supplied.  In
        relation to the Article 8 claim, as nobody has  attended  to  pursue
        this matter further, I find the Secretary of  State  has  discharged
        the burden of proof upon her to the required standard to  show  that
        the decision is proportionate to the legitimate aim relied upon  and
        dismiss this element too.


    15. The Appellant asks in her letter that if the appeal is dismissed she
        is advised how she can have a visa to join her husband in the United
        Kingdom. It is not appropriate for the tribunal to give  advice  but
        it is always open to the Appellant to make a fresh  application  for
        entry  clearance.   If  she  does,  she  must  ensure  that  it   is
        accompanied by the required information  to  show  she  is  able  to
        satisfy the requirements of the Rules, including those  set  out  in
        Appendix FM-SE. If she does,  there  is  a  strong  possibility  her
        application will succeed.


Decision

    16. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I  set  aside
        the decision of  the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    17. The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.  I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
