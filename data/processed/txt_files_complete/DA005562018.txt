                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. On 26 March 2019 the Upper Tribunal found a judge of the First-tier
        Tribunal had erred in law in allowing the appellants appeal against
        the order for his deportation from the United Kingdom.  The  appeal
        comes back before the Upper Tribunal to allow it  to  substitute  a
        decision to either allow or dismiss the appeal.




Background


     2. The appellant is a national of Hungry born on the 14 April 1967 who
        has been convicted of numerous  driving  offences,  despite  having
        been warned by the Secretary of State that  consideration  will  be
        given to his deportation from the UK if he continues to  break  the
        law, which he did, resulting in the order dated 13 August  2018  to
        deport him form the UK.
     3. On 22 October 2018 the appellant was removed to Hungry.
     4. The appellant was permitted re-entry to the United Kingdom for  the
        purposes of attending  this  appeal  albeit  that  he  remained  in
        immigration detention. The appellant was escorted  to  the  hearing
        centre and from the hearing centre back to Morton Hall and left the
        United Kingdom on 16 August 2019  to  Hungary.  The  appellant  was
        therefore able to fully participate in the appeal  process  on  the
        day. The appellant was accompanied by his partner Ms [S].
     5. The First-tier Tribunal did not accept the claim by  the  appellant
        and Ms [S] that the offences were only committed  as  a  result  of
        medical emergency, it being found the appellant drove on a  regular
        basis and the conviction represented only  the  time  he  had  been
        caught doing so. This is a preserved finding.
     6. Oral evidence was heard from the appellant who  was  cross-examined
        by Mr McVeety.




Relevant level of protection



     7. It is not disputed that until his removal the appellant  had  lived
        in the United Kingdom  since  2008.  Ms  [S]  told  the  First-tier
        Tribunal that the appellant had worked from 2008 until he  suffered
        a heart attack in 2012, after which she worked for  an  agency  and
        then as a carer, leading to a finding the appellant resided in  the
        UK as a worker and then family member of an EEA national. The First-
        tier Tribunal concluded the appellant had shown he had acquired the
        5 years required to enable  him  to  claim  a  right  of  permanent
        residence meaning the  respondent  was  required  to  show  serious
        grounds  of  public  policy  or  public  security  to  justify  the
        deportation.
     8. Two issues raised by the respondent are that there is  no  evidence
        Ms [S] worked in the UK nor to show the  appellant  is  her  family
        member. It is said to be unclear if Ms [S] divorced her husband,  a
        Nigerian national, who did not qualify for a residence card  as  Ms
        [S] was unable to show she was exercising treaty rights.
     9. There is no evidence the appellant has married Ms [S] nor  formally
        applied to be recognised as her partner meaning  the  appellant  is
        unable to bring himself within regulation 8, nor rely upon Ms  [S],
        to establish  a  right  to  permanent  residence.  In  Macastena  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1558  it
        was found the applicant could not combine a period as a partner  in
        a durable relationship with time spent as a spouse for the purposes
        of acquiring permanent residence  where  the  applicant  had  never
        applied to the Secretary of State for a residence card on the basis
        of that durable relationship.  The tribunal could not exercise  the
        discretion under regulation 17(4) if the Secretary of State had not
        exercised it.
    10. In Kunwar (EFM - calculating periods of residence) [2019]  UKUT  63
        it was held a person is only residing in the UK in accordance  with
        regulations when a residence document is issued  and  only  periods
        since the issue can count towards establishing a permanent right of
        residence.
    11. Both Macastena and Kunwar were approved in SSHD v Aigbanbee  [2019]
        EWCA Civ 339 in which it was said that time prior to the issue of a
        residence card did not count at all even if one  had  been  applied
        for.
    12. The appellant claimed to be in a durable relationship with  Ms  [S]
        but has provided no evidence of any application being made for  him
        to be granted a Residence Card. Accordingly the applicant fails  to
        establish that he is entitled to  anything  other  than  the  lower
        level of protection.



The law



        In VB (deportation of EEA national: human rights?) Lithuania [2008]
        UKAIT 00087 the Tribunal said that (i) the  respondent's  power  to
        deport an EEA national is governed by the EEA Regulations 2006  and
        is much more restricted than in an 'ordinary' conducive case.  Only
        if satisfied that deportation is  required  on  grounds  of  public
        policy or public security should the Tribunal  go  on  to  consider
        whether deportation would contravene the Human Rights Convention.


        The 2016 regulations came fully into  force  on  1  February  2017.
        From that date a decision  to  remove  a  person  under  regulation
        19(3)(a)(b) or (c) of the 2006 regulations is treated as a decision
        to remove that person under regulation 23(6)(a), (b) or (c) of  the
        2016 regulations and a  deportation  order  made  under  regulation
        24(3) of the 2006 regulations is treated  as  a  deportation  order
        made under regulation 32(3) of the  2016  regulations  (schedule  6
        para 5 2016 regs).

    13. By virtue of Regulation 23(6) of the 2016  regulations  (a  similar
        provision was in regulation 19 (3) of the 2006 regulations) an  EEA
        national who has entered the United Kingdom or the family member of
        such a national who has entered the United Kingdom may  be  removed
        if:

             (a)  that person does not have or ceases to have  a  right  to
             reside under these Regulations; or


             (b)  the Secretary of State  has  decided  that  the  person's
             removal is justified on the grounds of public  policy,  public
             security or public health in accordance with regulation 27; or


             (c)  the Secretary of State  has  decided  that  the  person's
             removal is justified on grounds  of  misuse  of  rights  under
             regulation 26(3).

    14.  Regulation  21(5)  of  the  2006  regulations  (reg   27(5)   2016
        regulations) states that, The public  policy  and  public  security
        requirements of  the  United  Kingdom  include  restricting  rights
        otherwise conferred by these Regulations in order  to  protect  the
        fundamental interests of society and where a relevant  decision  is
        taken on grounds of public policy  or  public  security  it  (must)
        shall, (in addition to complying with the preceding  paragraphs  of
        this  regulation,)  be  taken  in  accordance  with  the  following
        principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;


             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;


             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society  taking
             into account past conduct of the person and  that  the  threat
             does not need to be imminent;


             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;


             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision


             (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative  grounds,  even
             in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the
             grounds are specific to the person.

    15. Regulation 21(6) (regulation 27 (6)) states that  before  taking  a
        relevant decision  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
        security in relation to a person who  is  resident  in  the  United
        Kingdom the decision maker must take account of considerations such
        as the age, state of health, family and economic situation  of  the
        person, the person's length of residence in the United Kingdom, the
        person's social and cultural integration into  the  United  Kingdom
        and the extent of the person's links with his country of origin.
    16. Regulation 27(8) of the 2016  regulations  says  that  a  court  or
        tribunal considering whether the requirements  of  this  regulation
        are met must (in particular)  have  regard  to  the  considerations
        contained in Schedule 1 (considerations of  public  policy,  public
        security and the fundamental interests of society etc).
    17. The  2016  regulations  (schedule  1  para  7)  set  out  what  the
        fundamental  interests  of  society  in  the  UK   include   namely
        preventing unlawful immigration and abuse of the  immigration  laws
        and maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of the  immigration
        control system including under the regulations and  of  the  common
        travel area,  maintaining  public  order,  preventing  social  harm
        preventing the evasion  of  taxes  and  duties,  protecting  public
        services, excluding or removing the EEA national or  family  member
        of an EEA national with a conviction (including where  the  conduct
        of that person is likely to cause, or has in  fact  caused,  public
        offence) and maintaining public confidence in the  ability  of  the
        relevant authorities to take such action, tackling offences  likely
        to cause harm to society where an immediate or direct victim may be
        difficult to identify but where there is wider societal harm  (such
        as offences related to the misuse of drugs or crime with  a  cross-
        border dimension), combating the effects of  persistent  offending,
        protecting the rights and freedoms  of  others,  particularly  from
        exploitation and trafficking, protecting the public, acting in  the
        best interests of a child, countering terrorism and  extremism  and
        protecting shared values.
    18. The 2016 regulations, schedule 1 paragraph 3, state that  where  an
        EEA national/family member has received a custodial sentence or  is
        a persistent  offender,  the  longer  the  sentence,  or  the  more
        numerous the convictions,  the  greater  the  likelihood  that  the
        individual's continued presence in the  UK  represents  a  genuine,
        present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  the  fundamental
        interests of society.
    19.  The public policy ground  for  removal  is  an  exception  to  the
        fundamental principle of the free exercise of  EU  rights  and,  as
        such, has to be construed restrictively. In R v Bouchereau 1978  QB
        732 (ECJ) 760 it was said that  the  presence  or  conduct  of  the
        individual should constitute a  genuine  and  sufficiently  serious
        threat to public policy.
    20. In relation to the burden of proof: in Straszewski [2015] EWCA  Civ
        1245 it was said that it was for the Member State  to  justify  its
        action where the removal of  an  EEA  national  would  prima  facie
        interfere  with  treaty  rights.  In  Arranz  (EEA  regulations   -
        deportation -test) [2017] UKUT 294 the Upper Tribunal held that the
        burden of proof lay on the SSHD to prove that a person represents a
        genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
        the fundamental interests of society.  That  the  burden  of  proof
        lies on the SSHD has recently been accepted by the Inner  House  of
        the Court of Session in SA v SSHD [2018] CSIH 28.




Discussion



    21. A finding that a threat to public security exists can only be  made
        in a case such  as  this  if  it  is  shown  the  appellant  has  a
        propensity to act in the same way in the future.
    22. The appellant's immigration history shows that between 3 June  2015
        and 21 June 2018 he  committed  various  offences  leading  to  six
        convictions and is a persistent offender.
    23. The appellant was  asked  at  length  during  the  hearing  why  he
        committed the offences to which he repeated the claim made  to  the
        First-Tier Tribunal that they  were  as  a  result  of  emergencies
        including the need to go to and from hospital and also to  pick  up
        medication. That such a claim has been found not to be  true  is  a
        preserved finding of the First-Tier Tribunal in which it was  found
        at [25] of that decision "She (Ms [S]) told me  that  the  offences
        were all committed because of medical emergencies.  That  the  only
        times he drove whilst  disqualified  were  when  these  emergencies
        occurred, I find it more likely that he drove on  a  regular  basis
        and the convictions were the only times when he was  caught.  I  am
        also sceptical about whether he has now received a  "wake-up  call"
        did not stop him reoffending. Neither did the warning  letter  sent
        in May 2007". The fact the appellant maintains an explanation  that
        has been found to lack credibility undermines the weight  that  can
        be placed upon his evidence generally. The impression given by  the
        appellant  was  that  he  was  seeking  to   minimise   and   avoid
        responsibility for his actions.
    24. Mr McVeety asked the appellant whether he could have taken  a  taxi
        or other form  of  transport  to  obtain  a  prescription  and  the
        appellant's claim he could not lacked plausibility. The reality  of
        the impression given by the evidence was that the  appellant  drove
        when he wished to do so as opposed to using other forms  of  public
        or  other  transport  as  it   was   more   convenient   for   him,
        notwithstanding that he had been disqualified from driving and  had
        no insurance.
    25. The appellant referred in evidence to the difference in the  system
        that existed in Hungary and that in the  United  Kingdom  but  that
        does not provide him with an excuse for his offending behaviour. If
        the appellant believed that because there was  no  need  to  secure
        insurance for the individual within Hungary he could drive  without
        the same  in  the  United  Kingdom  this  demonstrates  a  lack  of
        integration and understanding or respect for the  laws  of  the  UK
        where it is the individual and not the vehicle that is insured. The
        appellant did accept, however, in his evidence  that  no  insurance
        created danger to the public and although creating an impression of
        being somewhat evasive did  seem  to  accept  that  driving  whilst
        disqualified will be an offence if he was stopped by the police  in
        Hungary too.
    26. It is accepted that the appellant's age, he was born in 1967, means
        he grew up during the period when Hungary was under communist rule,
        which ended in 1989, where the State  accepted  responsibility  for
        almost  everything  that  went  on  within  that  country.  If   an
        individual was able to purchase  a  vehicle  but  the  vehicle  was
        involved in an  accident  if  it  was  perceived  the  vehicle  was
        property of the State the State would deal with  the  consequences.
        Such a position has never existed in the United  Kingdom  of  which
        the appellant must have been aware.
    27. In Hungary I accept the  car  itself  is  insured  instead  of  the
        driver, but some policies have restrictions on  the  driver's  age,
        policyholder age, gender and marital status that can influence  the
        price.  Third party liability  car  insurance  (k�telez?  felel?s�g
        biztos�t�s) is required and only registered cars  can  be  insured.
        When driving  in  Hungary,  a  proof  of  insurance  payment  (bank
        transfer or a yellow postal cheque receipt) along  with  the  car's
        registration papers must be carried in the vehicle  at  all  times.
        The appellant's claim of no requirement  similar  to  that  in  the
        United Kingdom is therefore without merit as there is still a  need
        to take  out  a  valid  policy  of  insurance  albeit  the  insured
        item/subject may be different.
    28. In relation to the driving licence issue, motoring laws in  the  UK
        and Hungary are strikingly similar in that drivers in Hungary  have
        to pass tests in theory, practical driving and basic first aid. The
        appellant's claim to the contrary  is  a  further  example  of  his
        attempts to avoid responsibility for his actions.
    29. There is no evidence the appellant has done anything by way of  his
        thought processes or understanding to evidence  that  he  will  not
        reoffend in the future if the opportunity arises.  His  explanation
        which was also put before the First-tier Tribunal that  there  will
        be no need to do so as Ms [S] was hoping to drive herself soon does
        not answer the question. Whilst this answer indicates there will be
        a vehicle available in the household there is no guarantee that  Ms
        [S] will be able to secure her licence or that, even  if  she  did,
        the appellant will not be tempted to drive again if it  suited  him
        as he has done in the past. I find  the  personal  conduct  of  the
        appellant represents a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious
        threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.
    30. In relation to the issue of rehabilitation, consideration has  been
        given to  the  decisions  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Essa  (EEA:
        rehabilitation/integration) [2013] UKUT 00316 (IAC)  and  MC  (Essa
        principles recast) Portugal [2015] UKUT 00520 (IAC).
    31. In this appeal there is no evidence of any attempt by the appellant
        at rehabilitation or any intention to seek the same.  The  reliance
        upon an explanation which has  been  rejected  and  found  to  lack
        credibility together the answers given  by  the  appellant  at  the
        hearing does not establish a great deal of hope for the future. The
        appellant fails to address the issue of rehabilitation or  to  show
        there are reasonable prospects of the same which will be  dependent
        upon a major change in the appellants thought processes. It was not
        made out that service that  could  assist  rehabilitation  are  not
        available in Hungary.
    32. Considering the proportionality  of  the  decision,  the  appellant
        lived with his partner Ms  [S]  before  his  deportation  from  the
        United Kingdom. Their relationship started in August 2008  although
        they had known each other before  then.  They  entered  the  United
        Kingdom in November 2008. They have family life together.
    33. The appellant has received treatment for a heart condition claiming
        that after suffering two heart attacks he was  no  longer  able  to
        work due to ill-health but there is insufficient  evidence  from  a
        medical practitioner in relation  to  the  extent  of  the  alleged
        disability or to show that  the  appellant  will  not  be  able  to
        receive adequate medical treatment in Hungary as he has  been  able
        to obtain medication with the  support  of  friends  since  he  was
        deported from the United Kingdom about a year ago.
    34. There are two children in the United Kingdom who have  remained  in
        the care of Ms [S].
    35. It was accepted by Mr McVeety that the issue in this  case  is  the
        proportionality of  the  decision.  The  personal  conduct  of  the
        appellant shows that during a period of three  years  he  committed
        twelve offences for which he received  convictions  despite  having
        been warned by the  respondent  that  if  he  continued  to  offend
        deportation will be considered.
    36. The offences are serious and could have resulted  in  very  serious
        consequences as an uninsured driver and demonstrate the appellant's
        continued efforts to flout the law. He is a repeat offender.
    37. The appellants reasons for the same are  an  explanation  that  has
        been rejected on the evidence.  The evidence  relied  upon  by  the
        appellant to explain his conduct and to reassure the Tribunal there
        will be no repeat of his behaviour in the future was poor  with  no
        medical evidence to support the alleged urgency  requiring  him  to
        drive for hospital treatment and it clearly being the case that the
        appellant chose to drive to pick up a prescription when  no  urgent
        need to do so was established. As Mr McVeety submitted the evidence
        supports a finding the appellant could not be  bothered  to  get  a
        taxi.
    38. The propensity to reoffend has been made out in accordance with the
        findings above.
    39. The appellant claims  he  has  strong  connections  to  the  United
        Kingdom and if this is the case he would have known that the law of
        the UK required him to have obtained a valid  driving  licence  and
        insurance, yet he obtained neither.
    40. There is no evidence of rehabilitation  or  evidence  of  steps  to
        minimise the risk of reoffending.
    41. The appellant's claim to have severed all ties to  Hungary  is  not
        accepted on the basis of his own evidence. The appellant's  claimed
        level of integration into the United Kingdom is, arguably, impacted
        upon by his conduct.
    42. The appellant's partner does not work in the United Kingdom and the
        evidence regarding the cost of his  ongoing  medical  treatment  in
        Hungary being met suggests that there is available  support.  There
        was  no  evidence  that  any  healthcare  required  would  not   be
        available.
    43. It is not disputed the appellant has two  children  in  the  United
        Kingdom.
    44. Ms [S] is a Hungarian national  and  it  was  not  made  out  that,
        although she would not choose to do so, she  could  not  return  to
        Hungary with live with the appellant and continue family life there
        with the children. The best interests of the children are to remain
        with their mother who is their primary carer.
    45. When weighing all the factors relied upon by the appellant  and  Ms
        [S] in support of the appellant's objection to his  being  deported
        from the United Kingdom, the fact the appellant presents a risk  to
        the public of further commission of serious  offences  placing  the
        public at risk weighs heavily in the proportionality assessment.
    46. The appellant does not work in the United Kingdom and is  therefore
        not being denied the chance to exercise treaty rights  and  neither
        does his partner. The risk of reoffending is real. Connection  with
        Hungary clearly exists.
    47. I find the Secretary of State has discharged the burden upon her to
        the required standard to establish that it is proportionate in  all
        the circumstances for the appellant to be deported from the  United
        Kingdom. Whilst the appellant would like to remain  in  the  United
        Kingdom to see the  children  grow  up  here,  to  receive  medical
        treatment on the NHS to deal with any health needs, and  to  remain
        here with MS [S], the evidence  considered  in  the  round  clearly
        supports the finding that, pursuant to the  EEA  regulations,  this
        appeal must be dismissed.
