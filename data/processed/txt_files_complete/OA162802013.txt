                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:           Ms Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Kamran, Pride Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan date of  birth  18th  August
       1985.  On the 6th June 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Crawford)
       allowed her  appeal  against  a  refusal  to  issue  her  with  entry
       clearance as the spouse of a person present and settled  in  the  UK.
       The Entry Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  now  has  permission  to  appeal
       against that decision[1].

    2. In the notice of refusal dated 25th July 2013  the  ECO  makes  three
       points.

    3. The first there was some ambiguity in the evidence about whether  the
       Sponsor was free to marry the Respondent; this was  resolved  in  the
       Respondent's favour by the First-tier Tribunal and the present appeal
       makes no challenge to that finding.

    4. Secondly the ECO was  not  satisfied  that  this  is  a  genuine  and
       subsisting marriage. Judge Crawford  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
       sponsor and took into account money transfer receipts  and  telephone
       bills showing contact between the pair. In respect of the latter some
       of these post-dated the decision; the Tribunal noted that  they  were
       therefore of limited evidential value, only going to  show  that  the
       previous contact is ongoing. He was satisfied that there is a genuine
       relationship. The ECO's Grounds of Appeal to this Tribunal  challenge
       that finding on the grounds that the  post-decision  evidence  should
       have  been  entirely  excluded  from  Judge   Crawford's   reasoning.
       Permission has been expressly refused on  that  point,  Judge  Grant-
       Hutchinson finding "there is no error of law for the  Judge  to  have
       relied on post-decision evidence of contact between  the  parties  to
       show that they have a genuine and subsisting marriage and  intend  to
       live together permanently. The Judge accepted there was  pre-decision
       evidence and the post-decision evidence strengthens  his  views  that
       their relationship has remained the  same".    I  would  respectfully
       agree and find there to be no error in  the  approach  taken  to  the
       telephone bills.

    5. That leaves in issue  the  final  matter:  maintenance.  The  refusal
       notice simply states that no decision had been  made  in  respect  of
       whether the application met the requirements of Appendices FM and FM-
       SE; because the ECO found the application to fall at the first hurdle
       no consideration had been given to this matter.  Having resolved  all
       other matters in Ms Ullah's favour,  Judge Crawford proceeded to deal
       with this issue on appeal.   He noted that  the  burden  lay  on  the
       applicant to show that her Sponsor  was  earning  over  the  required
       �18,600 per annum. Judge Crawford made findings of fact that  he  was
       actually earning �19,500, and allowed the appeal.  The ECO takes  two
       issues with that. First it is said that Judge Crawford failed to have
       regard to the specified  evidence  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE,
       which the Sponsor had not met; secondly it is said that he  erred  in
       failing to assess the Sponsor's income at the date  of  decision  (as
       opposed to the date of hearing).

  Error of Law

    6. At the hearing on the 3rd November 2014 I heard submissions from both
       parties and having done so I indicated that the  ECO  had  shown  the
       determination to contain an error of law. In order for the appeal  to
       be allowed under the Immigration Rules, Ms Ullah had to show that her
       sponsor not only earned the requisite amount of money at the relevant
       date, but she had to demonstrate that with  reference  to  particular
       pieces of evidence as stipulated in paragraph 2  of  Appendix  FM-SE.
       This determination does not refer to Appendix FM-SE  but  appears  to
       accept that the requirements of paragraph E-ECP.3.1  of  Appendix  FM
       are met simply be  reference  to  the  Sponsor's  tax  documents  and
       payslips. One might think that the fact that he has paid HMRC tax  on
       an income of �19,500 might be enough to satisfy the ECO that he  does
       earn that amount, but there we are.  The rules  are  the  rules,  and
       this determination fails to make clear findings as  to  whether  they
       were met.

  The Re-Making

    7. Following my indication that I had found an error of law the  parties
       acknowledged  that  they  were  in  difficulties  dealing  with   the
       remaining live issue. Because the ECO had not  addressed  maintenance
       in his decision, the documentary evidence  that  had  been  submitted
       with the application had not been reproduced in the ECO's bundle.  Ms
       Ullah's solicitors did not appear to have a full record of  what  had
       been submitted and when. I therefore agreed to  delay  the  re-making
       until all of the evidence was before me and the parties had each  had
       an opportunity to make  any  written  submissions  on  it  that  they
       wishes.

    8.  That  apparently  simple  course  of  action  proved   rather   more
       complicated  than  it  initially  seemed;  the   Respondent   changed
       representatives  part  way  through  proceedings  and   her   current
       representatives wrote at least twice to  the  Tribunal  requesting  a
       full  copy  of  Judge  Crawford's  decision,  necessitating   further
       directions to be sent on the 26th November 2014 in  which  I  pointed
       out that they had been provided with a full copy at  the  hearing  on
       the 3rd November 2014 and that in any event  it  was  now  immaterial
       since that decision had been set aside. They  nevertheless  persisted
       in making lengthy written submissions as to why the decision of Judge
       Crawford did not contain  a  material  error  of  law,  and  entirely
       failing to provide the evidence that was the object  of  the  lengthy
       adjournment. Both parties have  now  had  plenty  of  opportunity  to
       comply with my directions.

    9. The only issue is whether Ms Ullah and her sponsor can show  that  at
       the date of decision on the 25th July 2013 she met  the  requirements
       of paragraph E-ECP.3.1. To do that she must show that their household
       had an income of at least �18,600 at that date and  demonstrate  this
       with reference to ALL of the documents mentioned in paragraph 2 of FM-
       SE:
         2. In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where
         paragraph 9 applies), all of the following evidence must be
         provided:
         (a) Payslips covering:
              (i) a period of 6 months prior to the date of application if
              the person has been employed by their current employer for at
              least 6 months (and where paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix
              does not apply); or
              (ii) any period of salaried employment in the period of 12
              months prior to the date of application if the person has been
              employed by their current employer for less than 6 months (or
              at least 6 months but the person does not rely on paragraph
              13(a) of this Appendix), or in the financial year(s) relied
              upon by a self-employed person.
         (b) A letter from the employer(s) who issued the payslips at
         paragraph 2(a) confirming:
              (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;
              (ii) the length of their employment;
              (iii) the period over which they have been or were paid the
              level of salary relied upon in the application; and
              (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or
              agency).
         (c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period(s) as
         the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the salary has been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in the name of
         the person and their partner jointly.
         (d) Where the person is a director of a limited company based in
         the UK, evidence that the company is not of a type specified in
         paragraph 9(a). This can include the latest Annual Return filed at
         Companies House.

   10. The Sponsor is Mr Sami Ullah. He is the manager of a family business,
       established in 1971. It  is  a  mini-supermarket.   He  receives  his
       income in cash and payslips are generated by  the  accountant.   With
       reference to paragraph 2 of  FM-SE  I  have  the  following  evidence
       before me:

             a) Payslips issued  by  Burnage  Food  Store  between  the  5th
                October 2012 and 18th May 2013, showing gross income of �375
                per week. There are actually more payslips than this  but  I
                mention  these  because  these  cover  the  6  month  period
                immediately  prior  to,   and   including,   the   date   of
                application.  The salary shown equates to �19,500 per annum.
                I am satisfied that this requirement of FM-SE is met.

             b) There is no letter from the employer in the material  before
                me.

             c) The bundles do contain some bank statements from the Halifax
                and these  do  show  some  deposits.  They  do  not  however
                correspond to the same six month period as the payslips  and
                it is not clear that the Sponsor's wage  was  paid  in  each
                week.

             d) This is not applicable to the Sponsor's salaried employment.

   11. The  material  before  me  fails  to  demonstrate  that  all  of  the
       evidential requirements were met. Like Judge Crawford I have no doubt
       that Mr Ullah does earn �19,500 per annum but he has failed to  prove
       this with reference to the right bits of paper.

   12. I heard no submissions on Article 8  but  insofar  as  this  decision
       might be said to show a lack of respect for  the  parties'  right  to
       family life with each other, I note that there is nothing to  prevent
       Ms Ullah from making a fresh  application,  which  supported  by  the
       correct documentation - I have set it out above -  will  now  succeed
       since the Tribunal's findings as to the bona fides of  this  marriage
       are upheld.

       Decisions

   13. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors  of  law
       and it is set aside.

   14. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows:

        "the appeal is dismissed on all grounds".

   15. I make no direction for anonymity.
