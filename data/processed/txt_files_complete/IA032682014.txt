Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Jafar of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent is a citizen of India who appealed against a decision of
    the appellant dated 20th December 2013 to refuse  her  application  for
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant pursuant to paragraph 245ZX of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as
    amended).  In a determination promulgated  on  26th  August  2014  FTTJ
    Sweet allowed her appeal on Article 8 grounds.  He concluded  that  the
    respondent had  not  met  the  Immigration  Rules  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities, but under Article 8 she should be allowed to  remain  in
    the UK until the outcome of her current course which concluded on  30th
    October 2014.  The appeal was allowed to that limited extent.

 2. The appellant sought permission to appeal and the grounds of appeal are
    in the following terms:

                             "GROUNDS OF APPEAL

         1.   The Immigration Judge erred in law  by  failing  to  take  the
             correct approach in considering cases that engage Article 8 as
             set out in Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct  approach)
             [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC)

              'After applying the requirements of the Rules, only  if  there
                  may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
                  outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to  go
                  on to consider whether there are compelling  circumstances
                  not sufficiently recognised under them'.

         2.   Having found that the  appeal  failed  under  the  rules,  the
             Immigration Judge should have gone on  to  consider  if  there
             were  'exceptional'  or  'compelling  circumstances'.   It  is
             respectfully submitted that a failure to do so, and a  failure
             to  refer  to  Home  Office  Guidance  on   'exceptional'   or
             'compelling' circumstances, constitute  a  material  error  of
             law.

         3.   It is submitted that the Immigration Judge  erred  in  law  by
             failing to give adequate reasons  as  to  why  the  appeal  as
             allowed outside the rules on the basis of Article 8.

         4.   It is also submitted that the Immigration Judge failed to take
             into account the guidance in  Nasim  and  others  (Article  8)
             [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC) which makes it clear that less  weight
             should be placed on periods of work or study when  considering
             Article 8."

 3. On 3rd October 2013 FTTJ Frankish granted permission to appeal  in  the
    following terms:

         "REASONS FOR DECISION (including any decision on extending time)

             1.   In a determination promulgated on 26  August  2014  F-tTJ
                  Sweet allowed an appeal, the appellant having  obtained  a
                  health and social care diploma, hotel  management  diploma
                  and awaiting her exam results for  a  management  diploma,
                  against refusal of Tier 4 status on  the  grounds  that  a
                  breach of article 8 thereby arose.

             2.   The application for permission to appeal asserts that the
                  F-tTJ failed to take the Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules  -
                  correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 and Nasim (2014)  UKUT
                  25 approach in failing to apply exceptional  circumstances
                  in order to consider article 8 outside of the Rules.

             3.   The appellant lacked the requisite bank evidence  at  the
                  time of application and therefore did  not  qualify  under
                  the Rules although later inadmissible evidence might  have
                  caused her to qualify (no conclusion was reached on this -
                  �15).  However (�17), it was  considered  disproportionate
                  for her to return before her results in October  2014.   A
                  long line of cases, including MM and  SA  (Pankina:  near-
                  miss) Pakistan [2010] UKUT 481  rule  against  allowing  a
                  case on the basis of  a  near  miss  or  substituting  the
                  judge's view of what the Rules should say for what they do
                  say.  This is arguably what has occurred here."

 4. Thus the matter came before me to determine whether there is  an  error
    of law in the First-tier Tribunal determination.

 5. The background to the respondent's appeal and the chronology is set out
    in paragraphs 14-17 of the determination which I set out below:

         "Findings of Fact

         14.  The burden of proof is on the Appellant.  The  civil  standard
             of a balance of probabilities applies.   The  Appellant  first
             arrived in the UK in January 2010 with a  student  visa  valid
             till October 2011.  She was granted further leave on 29th June
             2012 to 6th March  2013.   It  appears  that  she  studied  at
             Futures College for an NVQ level 3 in Health and  Social  care
             from September 2009 to March 2011, followed by  a  Diploma  in
             Hotel Management from November 2011 to November 2012.  She  is
             currently studying at London College of Business Sciences  for
             a Diploma in Management (level 6), which ran from  March  2013
             to September 2014.  She has paid  the  fees  in  full  and  is
             currently awaiting the results  of  her  examination  on  30th
             October 2014.

         15.  In support of her most recent application, she relied  on  the
             sponsorship from her father and a letter from  Andhra  Pradesh
             Grameena Vikas Bank dated 19th February 2013.  This  bank  was
             not on the Respondent's approved financial institutions as  at
             24th November 2011 (Appendix P of the Immigration Rules),  but
             the Appellant states that she checked with the Respondent that
             the bank was indeed acceptable and received such  reassurance,
             possibly because she stated (as set out in the bank's  letter)
             that it was sponsored by State Bank of India - which is indeed
             on the list of approved financial institutions under  table  3
             of Appendix P.  Whether or not I accept that she received such
             reassurance, the fact is that her sponsoring bank was  not  on
             the list of approved financial institutions at the time of her
             application in March 2013 and the Presenting Officer submitted
             that it was never on the approved list.

         16.  The Appellant now relies on post-decision evidence in support,
             being the revised sponsor's affidavit dated  5th  August  2014
             (pages 10 to 11) and a  bank  statement  from  State  Bank  of
             Hyderabad - which is indeed  one  of  the  approved  financial
             institutions under table 3 of Appendix P.  However,  I  cannot
             accept post-decision evidence and therefore  I  conclude  that
             the Appellant has not met the Immigration Rules on the balance
             of probabilities.

         17.  However, I am able to consider the Appellant's claimed  rights
             under Article 8 ECHR.  She has been a student in the UK  since
             2010, having obtained appropriate visas, meeting the fees  and
             maintenance  requirements  and  duly  paying  her  rent.   Her
             current course, which she has now  concluded  but  awaits  the
             results, was for a Diploma in Management at London College  of
             Business Studies running from March 2013  to  September  2014.
             She awaits the results in October 2014, and states that she is
             still attending the college on Monday and Tuesday in order  to
             maintain  her  attendance  record.   I  do  not  consider   it
             proportionate for her to have to return to India  pending  the
             outcome of her results in October 2014, not  just  because  if
             she does not pass all the modules, she may have to take a  re-
             sit, but also following CDS (Brazil) she will have built up  a
             sufficient private life in  the  UK  since  arriving  for  her
             studies that it would not be proportionate for her  to  return
             to India at this stage."

 6.  On  behalf  of  the  appellant  Ms  Isherwood   submitted   that   the
    determination contains a material error of law and she  relied  on  the
    grounds of appeal provided.  She observed there was no challenge  to  a
    dismissal of the decision under the Immigration Rules and  having  read
    the skeleton argument  helpfully  provided  by  Mr  Jafar  it  made  no
    reference to the case of Patel and others v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2013] UKSC 72 which found at paragraphs 56 and 57:

         "56. Although the context of the  rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
             consideration of proportionality, I agree with Burnton LJ that
             this cannot  be  equated  with  a  formalised  "near-miss"  or
             "sliding scale" principle, as argued for by  Mr  Malik.   That
             approach is unsupported  by  Strasbourg  authority,  or  by  a
             proper reading of Lord Bingham's words.  Mrs Huang's case  for
             favourable treatment outside the rules did  not  turn  on  how
             close she had come to compliance with rule  317,  but  on  the
             application of the family values which underlie that rule  and
             are at the heart also of article 8.  Conversely,  a  near-miss
             under the rules cannot provide substance  to  a  human  rights
             case which is otherwise lacking in merit.

         57.  It is important to remember that article 8 is  not  a  general
             dispensing  power.   It  is  to  be  distinguished  from   the
             Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
             outside the rules, which may be  unrelated  to  any  protected
             human right.  The merits of a decision not to depart from  the
             rules are not reviewable on appeal: section  86(6).   One  may
             sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for "common sense"
             in the application of the rules to  graduates  who  have  been
             studying in the  UK  for  some  years  (see  para  47  above).
             However, such considerations  do  not  by  themselves  provide
             grounds of appeal under article 8,  which  is  concerned  with
             private  or  family  life,  not  education   as   such.    The
             opportunity for a promising student to complete his course  in
             this country, however desirable in general terms,  is  not  in
             itself a right protected under article 8."

 7. There is no near miss principle and the  opportunity  for  a  promising
    student to complete her course is not a right protected  under  Article
    8.  Ms Isherwood also indicated that  part  of  the  challenge  to  the
    determination was a lack of adequate reasons challenge in  relation  to
    the reasoning applied to the case  of  CDS  (Brazil)  [2010]  UKUT  305
    relied upon by the judge at paragraph 17 of the determination.

 8. Mr Jafar relied upon his skeleton  argument.   He  submitted  that  the
    judge had not wrongly applied any near miss principle.  The  judge  had
    made no reference to allowing the appeal because the respondent  nearly
    met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Mr  Jafar  relied  upon
    the case of MM [2014] EWCA Civ 985 to submit that  if  a  person  falls
    outside the Immigration Rules she must demonstrate she has an  arguable
    case to show she has grounds for consideration outside  of  the  Rules.
    Mr Jafar submitted those factors were that there  has  never  been  any
    period of time when the respondent was in the United Kingdom illegally.
     She gained entry in 2010 and renewed her visa under  the  points-based
    scheme with the support of her father as her  financial  sponsor  using
    the same bank account.  This is not a case where  Article  8  is  being
    considered where the establishment of a private life has been  achieved
    when immigration status was precarious.  At all  times  the  respondent
    has had lawful  immigration  status  in  the  United  Kingdom.  If  the
    particular circumstances of an applicant's case are not dealt  with  by
    the Home Secretary within the Immigration Rules  then  the  judge  must
    look at Strasbourg case law which is cited in  the  skeleton  argument.
    Looking at the factors the judge took into account the judge  knew  the
    respondent needed only a few months to finish  her  course  in  October
    2014.  The course was running until the end of  September.   The  judge
    had to decide whether it was proportionate, fair  or  unduly  harsh  to
    require her to stop her studies in which she had invested so  much  and
    be required to leave  and  make  an  application  for  entry  clearance
    outside the United Kingdom.

 9. In this case there  is  no  public  interest  in  the  removal  of  the
    respondent.  She is not a burden on the state and not a case where  she
    seeks to gain anything other than a short period of  time  to  complete
    something very important to her.

10. The respondent sought to address the court.  She submitted that she had
    made a simple mistake with  regard  to  the  bank  account  that  after
    becoming aware that the bank was not an approved bank  her  father  had
    opened a new bank account to meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Her father had invested a  great  deal  of  his  money  in  her
    studies in the United Kingdom and it would be terrible if she had to go
    back and would not be able to return to the  United  Kingdom  again  to
    complete  her  studies.   If  she  has  successfully  passed  all   her
    examinations she would like to apply to study for a Masters  Degree  in
    the United Kingdom.

Decision

11. Whilst I have a great deal of  sympathy  for  the  respondent  and  the
    predicament she found herself in as a result of  the  submission  of  a
    bank statement from a  bank  not  on  the  approved  list,  I  have  no
    difficulty in finding, in the  light  of  Supreme  Court  authority  of
    Patel, that the judge erred in  law  in  allowing  the  appeal  of  the
    respondent on Article 8 grounds.  It can be seen from the facts as  set
    out by the judge in his determination that there  were  no  exceptional
    compelling or indeed particular circumstances  requiring  consideration
    of the appeal outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Indeed  a  recent
    decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in  Meera  Muhiadeen  Heleemudeen  v
    Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  558
    summarised  the  legal  position  with  regard  to  Article  8  in  the
    Immigration Rules and found at paragraph 40:

         "I, however, consider that the FTT Judge did err in his approach to
         Article 8.  This is because he did not consider  Mr.  Haleemudeen's
         case for remaining in the  United  Kingdom  on  the  basis  of  his
         private and family life against the Secretary of State's policy  as
         contained in Appendix FM and Rule 276ADE of the Immigration  Rules.
         These new provisions in the Immigration Rules are a central part of
         the legislative and  policy  context  in  which  the  interests  of
         immigration control are balanced against the interests  and  rights
         of people who have come to this country and wish to settle  in  it.
         Overall the Secretary of State's policy as to when an  interference
         with an Article 8 right will be  regarded  as  disproportionate  is
         more particularised in the new Rules than it had  previously  been.
         The new Rules require stronger bonds with the United Kingdom before
         leave will be  given  under  them.   The  features  of  the  policy
         contained in the Rule  include  the  requirements  of  twenty  year
         residence, that the applicant's partner be a British citizen in the
         United Kingdom, settled here, or here with leave as  a  refugee  or
         humanitarian  protection,  and  that  where  the   basis   of   the
         application rests on the applicant's children that they  have  been
         residents for seven years.

         The  FTT's  decision  on  Mr  Haleemudeen's  Article  8  appeal  is
         contained in [34]-[41], which I summarised and set out in  part  at
         [21] - [23] above.  Those paragraphs do not refer, either expressly
         or implicitly, to paragraph 276ADE of the rules or to Appendix  FM.
         None of the new more particularised  features  of  the  policy  are
         identified  or  even  referred  to  in  general  terms.   The  only
         reference to the provisions is in the FTT's summary  (at  [30])  of
         Mr. Richardson's submission that the reference to the new Rules  in
         the refusal letter was of little relevance because at the  time  of
         Mr. Haleemudeen's application those Rules had not been  promulgated
         and thus did not apply to his  case.   That  submission  could  not
         succeed in view of the decision of the House of Lords in  Odelola's
         case, to which I refer at [25] above".

12. In the determination which is the subject of the application before  me
    I find that the FTTJ did not set the respondent's right to respect  for
    private life against the Secretary of State's policy  as  contained  in
    the Immigration Rules.

13. For all of these reasons I find that FTTJ erred in law in carrying  out
    the Article 8 assessment and his determination must be set aside.

14. On the facts as found by the FTTJ and in the light  of  binding  higher
    authority case law  having  found  the  respondent  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration  Rules  the  appeal  should  have  been
    dismissed on that basis.

15. I therefore remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by  substituting  a
    decision dismissing the appeal.

Conclusions

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

17. I set aside the decision

18. I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.


Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
