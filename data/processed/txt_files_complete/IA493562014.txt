For the appellant:     Mr T Shah, instructed by Taj Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr S Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, MD Farhad Hussain, date of birth 31.10.96, is a  citizen
    of Bangladesh.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Cameron promulgated 22.6.15, dismissing his appeal against the decision
    of the Secretary of State, dated 18.11.14, to  refuse  his  application
    for further leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  on  the  basis  of
    private and/or family life and to remove him from the  UK  pursuant  to
    section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 22.6.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Landes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    5.11.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 22.1.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below I find no error of law in the  making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision
    of Judge Cameron to be set aside.

 6. In granting permission to appeal Judge Landes found  it  arguable  that
    the judge erred in his approach to whether family life existed  between
    the appellant and his family in UK. "The judge  explained  that  having
    considered the evidence overall  he  was  not  satisfied  there  was  a
    dependency going beyond normal emotional ties between the appellant and
    his siblings [116]. Although the judge did  not  explain  his  findings
    further, it may be that the reason for his findings lay in the  earlier
    paragraph i.e. that the appellant had not lived  with  his  sister  for
    many years and had been in part supported by his foster  family  [115].
    It is arguable however that the reasons provided are not adequate given
    the judge's  earlier  acceptance  that  the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and his sister was  more  like  mother  and  son  [110],  the
    judge's comments at [114] about the extremely  close  contact  the  two
    enjoyed despite the fact they did not live together,  and  the  judge's
    rejection of family life between the appellant and  his  foster  family
    based at  least  in  part  on  his  findings  that  the  appellant  had
    maintained his ties to his own family members and had  relied  on  them
    for support [118]."

 7. I have carefully considered the grounds of appeal. There is no  dispute
    with the findings of facts as found by the judge, many of which, as has
    been pointed out, are favourable to the  appellant's  case.  The  judge
    very carefully set out the relevant background, summarised all the oral
    evidence and submissions in some considerable detail, and in  the  main
    correctly directed himself on the law before setting out  his  findings
    of fact and credibility from �93 onwards. It cannot be  said  that  the
    judge ignored or failed to take into  account  all  those  factors  now
    relied on by the appellant. However, the  essence  of  the  appellant's
    case, as enlarged on by Mr Shah's helpful submissions, is that on those
    findings the judge should have reached a different conclusion as to the
    extent of family life with his sister, and to a lesser degree with  his
    brothers,  all  of  whom  are  settled  in  the  UK,  and  whether  the
    interference with that family life which would  be  occasioned  by  his
    removal was proportionate.

 8. The Rule 24 reply, dated 18.11.15, submits that "The grounds  are  mere
    disagreement with the judge's assessment of the evidence - there is  no
    misdirection in law, the judge's reasons are adequate - the grounds are
    in reality an irrationality challenge and that very high threshold  has
    not been met in this case."

 9. In MA (Somalia) [2010] UKSC 49, it was said that "Where a tribunal  has
    referred to considering all the evidence, a reviewing  body  should  be
    very slow to conclude that that tribunal overlooked some factor, simply
    because the factor is not explicitly referred to in  the  determination
    concerned."

10. In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC), the
    Tribunal held that (i) Although there is a legal duty to give  a  brief
    explanation of the conclusions on the central issue on which an  appeal
    is determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as a
    whole makes sense, having regard to the material accepted by the judge;
    (ii) Although a  decision  may  contain  an  error  of  law  where  the
    requirements to give adequate reasons are not met, the  Upper  Tribunal
    would not normally set aside a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    where there has been no misdirection of law, the  fact-finding  process
    cannot be criticised and the relevant Country Guidance has  been  taken
    into account, unless the conclusions the judge draws from  the  primary
    data were not reasonably open to him or her.

11. I find that the judge was reasonably entitled to reach the  conclusion,
    set out at �116 of the  decision,  that  on  the  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal that he was not satisfied that the appellant  and  his  sister
    have a dependency which  goes  beyond  normal  emotional  ties,  having
    already pointed out that whilst  he  has  maintained  "extremely  close
    contact" he is now 18 years of age, and has not lived with  his  sister
    for a number of years, having been raised by a foster family for some 5
    years. I find that conclusion was properly and adequately reasoned  and
    is neither perverse nor irrational. Whilst there are factors  going  to
    the strength of the relationship between the appellant and his  sister,
    including those relied on in the grounds of application for  permission
    to appeal, it is clear the judge  did  not  overlook  or  ignore  those
    factors and was careful to  set  them  out.  It  does  not  necessarily
    follow, however, that the judge was obliged to reach the  decision  the
    appellant contends for. To this extent, the grounds  are  in  effect  a
    disagreement with the decision and do not disclose an error of law.

12. Although she granted leave on all grounds, Judge  Landes  found  little
    merit  in  the  grounds  alleging  a  failure  of  the  proportionality
    assessment. Considering that "the strength of the grounds lies  in  the
    argument that the erred in his  approach  to  family  life"  the  judge
    rejected the ground that the  judge  failed  to  apply  the  article  8
    proportionality exercise, referring to  �128  and  �146,  and  stating,
    "Given the terms of section  117B,  I  do  not  see  that  the  judge's
    ultimate conclusion can be faulted if the appellant only enjoys private
    life with his siblings." With that part of the grant  of  permission  I
    respectfully agree.

13. It was  also  relevant  to  the  proportionality  assessment  that  the
    appellant could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  for
    leave to remain and that, pursuant to section 117B  of  the  2002  Act,
    immigration control  is  in  the  public  interest,  and  by  the  same
    provision little weight should be given to  a  private  life  developed
    whilst the appellant's immigration status was precarious, as it clearly
    was.

14. I am satisfied  that  the  grounds  amount  to  no  more  than  a  mere
    disagreement with the conclusions drawn and that no  error  of  law  is
    disclosed.

Conclusions:

15. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
