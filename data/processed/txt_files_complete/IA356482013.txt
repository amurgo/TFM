Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Authi, instructed by Aman Solicitors Advocates


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
The Appeal

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of  State  against  a  determination
    promulgated on 5 March 2014 of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Camp  which
    allowed the Article 8 appeal of the respondent.

 2. For the purposes of this determination, I  refer  to  Mr  Ayub  as  the
    appellant and to the Secretary of State as the  respondent,  reflecting
    their positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 3. The background to this matter is that the appellant came to the  UK  on
    21 August 2011 as a student with leave until 26 July 2012. He  met  his
    British partner at some point in 2011. At that  time  she  was  married
    under UK law to her ex-husband. Nevertheless,  the  appellant  and  his
    partner formed a genuine relationship and married under Islamic law  on
    16 July 2012. On 24 July 2012 the appellant applied for leave to remain
    on the basis of the relationship. The appellant's  partner  obtained  a
    civil divorce on 5 December 2012. The appellant's application for leave
    was refused on 12 August 2013.

 4. The above matters are not in dispute and  it  was  also  common  ground
    before me that the relationship was genuine and that the appellant  and
    his partner were "honest and credible witnesses"; see [14] and [17]  of
    the First-tier Tribunal decision.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. In addition to the matters set out above, Judge  Camp  found  that  the
    couple had undergone a religious marriage but that  this  was  not  one
    valid under English law; see [17].

 6. He also found that the appellant was not a fianc� for the  purposes  of
    the Immigration Rules as he could not satisfy paragraph E-LTRP.1.12. of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules,  that  being  that  he  had  been
    granted entry clearance as a fianc�; see [20].

 7. He went on to conclude at [21] that:

         "... the appellant does not, for reasons which can  reasonably  be
         described as legal (in relation to the validity  of  the  marriage)
         and technical (in relation to the detail of the  rules),  meet  the
         requirements of Appendix FM."

 8. Having found that the appeal under the provisions of Appendix FM  could
    not succeed, Judge Camp conducted a free-standing Article 8 assessment.



 9. Following on from the findings at [18] to [20] as to why the  appellant
    did not meet the Immigration Rules, he refers at [25] to a "failure  of
    the immigration rules to deal with [the appellant's]  situation."  That
    is a reference to the appellant not being able to show that  he  was  a
    spouse, fianc� or unmarried partner for the purposes of the Immigration
    Rules. The First-tier Tribunal  makes a similar comment at [28], to the
    effect that  a  "literal  interpretation  of  the  rules  prevents  the
    appellant from being regarded as a fianc�, although  his  intention  to
    marry the appellant is not changed by the respondent".

10. At [24] he found the circumstances of the appellant to be "unusual" and
    a '"Catch-22"' situation. The circumstances referred to here were  that
    the appellant had not been able to enter into a valid marriage with his
    partner  even  though  she  had  obtained  a  civil  divorce  as   "the
    appellant's passport has been retained because he is said  to  have  no
    right to remain here." At [28] the judge refers to  the  couple  "being
    unable to marry under English or any other UK law, essentially  because
    the appellant has no leave to remain in the UK."

11. The conclusion at [28]  was  that  these  matters,  together  with  the
    genuine nature of the relationship and the couple regarding  themselves
    as married, made the decision disproportionate.

Error of Law

12. The respondent objects to the finding of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
    [25] that there was a "failure of the Immigration Rules  to  deal  with
    the appellant's situation". She maintains that  this  finding  was  not
    open to the judge and that it should not have been a factor weighed for
    the appellant in the proportionality assessment.

13.  The  respondent's  challenge  has  merit.  For  the  purposes  of  the
    Immigration Rules, the appellant was not a  spouse,  a  fianc�e  or  an
    unmarried partner. The appellant does not dispute that.

14. The logic of the First-tier Tribunal judge is that even though this was
    so, the Immigration Rules ought to provide for someone with his profile
    to be able to obtain leave under those Rules. I could not see how  that
    could be correct.  The Immigration Rules are not  required  to  provide
    for every situation. It  cannot  be  right  that  they  are  unfair  or
    otherwise unsatisfactory such that weight accrues  to  the  appellant's
    side of the balance in failing to allow for leave to be issued to  this
    appellant, albeit he is in a genuine  relationship,  has  undergone  an
    Islamic marriage and also wants to undergo a civil marriage.

15. The Court of Appeal referred in MM & Ors v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985  to
    situations where the Immigration Rules might be found to be  unfair  or
    otherwise non-compliant with human rights law, commenting at [132]:

         "First, the Secretary of State plainly is under a common  law  duty
         not to promulgate an [Immigration  Rule]  that  is  discriminatory,
         manifestly unjust, made in bad faith or involves  'such  oppressive
         or gratuitous interference with the rights of those subject to them
         as could find no justification in the minds of reasonable men'. "

16. The  failure  of  the  Immigration  Rules  to  cover  this  appellant's
    circumstances simply cannot be characterised in the terms  set  out  by
    the Court of Appeal. The appellant was not entitled to  weight  in  his
    favour arising from his inability to  meet  the  Immigration  Rules  as
    apportioned by the First-tier Tribunal, shown at [20], [21],  [25]  and
    [28]. Rather, the failure to do so fell to be the starting point of the
    Article 8 proportionality exercise, an approach  not  followed  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal; see Haleemudeen v SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  558  at
    [47].

17. The First-tier Tribunal was also in error in finding at [24]  that  the
    appellant's circumstances were "unusual" or a ' "Catch-22" ' situation.
    It is simply not correct that he could not enter into a civil  marriage
    as he was unable to obtain his passport or any other document  allowing
    him to marry under UK law. There  was  nothing  before  Judge  Camp  to
    indicate that the appellant had ever made any  attempt  to  obtain  his
    passport from the respondent or any  other  document  that  would  have
    allowed him to marry. He had ample time to do so, the  partner's  civil
    divorce occurring on 5 December 2012, the decision  being  made  on  12
    August 2013 and the hearing  before  Judge  Camp  taking  place  on  12
    February 2014. It was conceded before me that he had never made such  a
    request to the respondent or anyone else. There was, in  fact,  nothing
    to prevent the appellant from obtaining his passport or other  document
    in order to marry under UK law if he so wished.

18. Without the weight given by Judge Camp to the appellant's inability  to
    marry and the alleged failure of the Immigration  Rules  to  allow  for
    leave to be granted to someone in his position, it appeared to me  that
    it could not be said that the outcome of the Article 8  proportionality
    assessment would have been the same.

19. For these reasons I found an error on a point of  law,  set  aside  the
    proportionality assessment of the First-tier Tribunal and re-made it.

Re-making

20. It follows from my reasoning above that the fact of the appellant being
    unable to qualify for leave to remain under any of  the  provisions  of
    the Immigration Rules is not something that weighs in his favour in the
    proportionality assessment. On the contrary, the failure  to  meet  the
    Immigration Rules is the starting point in that assessment  and  weighs
    against him.

21. Also, again as above, it is not my view that the appellant is  entitled
    to weight on his side of the balance  for  being  unable  to  meet  the
    Immigration Rules when it has been open to him to obtain  his  passport
    or other documentation allowing him to marry his partner.

22. Without those factors I did not accept that  there  was  anything  here
    that made the respondent's  decision  disproportionate.  The  appellant
    could not meet the Immigration Rules as he does not have  the  required
    relationship with his partner. He  can return  to  Pakistan  to  obtain
    entry clearance as a fianc�e or as a spouse if he and his  wife  choose
    to marry there or elsewhere. The rationale for it being reasonable  for
    him to do so is not merely in order to seek entry clearance as in Hyatt
    (Pakistan) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1054 but because  he  does  not  meet
    other substantive requirements of the Immigration Rules by way  of  his
    relationship to his partner. His circumstances  do  not  show  that  it
    would be unduly harsh to expect him to return to Pakistan, the  country
    where he has spent most of his life, having come to the UK with limited
    leave as a student and with no  expectation  of  remaining  beyond  his
    studies and then decide how he and  his  partner  wish  to  proceed  as
    regards their relationship.

Decision

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside. I re-make the appeal as refused under  Article
    8 of the ECHR.
