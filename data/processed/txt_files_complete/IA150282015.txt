                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Adebimpe Oluwatosin Adeyemi was born on  7  August  1986
    and is a female citizen of Nigeria.  The  litigation  history  in  this
    case is succinctly set out in the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Brewer) as follows:

         2.   The appellant's application for an extension of stay in the UK
             was rejected first on 28 October 2014 and again  on  31  March
             2015.  The appellant appealed to this Tribunal  following  the
             respondent's letter of 31 March  2015  when  her  appeal  came
             before Judge Nicholls for hearing on  11  January  2016.   The
             case was dealt with on the basis of documents only.

         3.   Judge Nicholls determined that the appellant had no  right  of
             appeal on the basis of no immigration decision had  been  made
             which was capable of being appealed.

         4.   The appellant's original application was submitted before  her
             leave to remain had expired but the  respondent  said  it  was
             unable to collect a fee and  wrote  to  the  appellant  on  28
             October 2014 stating the bank had  rejected  the  payment  and
             thus the application was returned as invalid.  The appellant's
             leave to remain expired on 28 October 2014.

         5.   The new application was  received  from  the  appellant  on  6
             November 2014.  The reasons for refusal letter dated 31  March
             2015, although it does deal with the basis of the  application
             for leave, nevertheless states that although  the  application
             was received, it was  refused  because  at  the  date  of  the
             application was received the appellant did not have  leave  to
             remain in the UK.

         6.   For her part, the appellant claimed that she did make a  valid
             application, in  time.   That  application  was  sent  to  the
             respondent on 18 October 2014.  However, the respondent argued
             that although it received the application in time, it was  not
             valid because although the appellant had included debit/credit
             card details on the application form, her  bank  had  rejected
             payment.

 2. Judge Nicholls dismissed the appellant's appeal on the  basis  that  he
    had no jurisdiction.  Leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted
    in June 2016 and the appeal came before  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    McGinty for hearing on 29 July 2016.  Judge McGinty  found  that  there
    had been procedural unfairness  (there  appeared  to  be  doubt  as  to
    whether the question of jurisdiction had been taken  as  a  preliminary
    issue or whether the appeal had been determined on  its  merits).   The
    decision of Judge Nicholls was set aside and the matter remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Brewer).  At [11], Judge Brewer wrote:

         11.  At the outset of the hearing I canvassed with the parties  how
             best  to  proceed.   The  substantive  appeal  is  potentially
             complex as it raises issues under  the  Immigration  Rules  as
             well as the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the  associated
             National Minimum  Wage  Regulations  2015.   The  jurisdiction
             issue is a relatively short point.  It was agreed therefore to
             deal first with the jurisdiction question and only if that was
             aside in the appellant's favour would it be necessary to  hear
             her evidence and argument on the substantive appeal.

 3. Judge Brewer examined the question of  jurisdiction  and  concluded  at
    [30]:

         30.  In  short,  notwithstanding  that  the  correct  details  were
             included on her application form by the  appellant,  her  bank
             rejected payment.  In the absence of any fault on the part  of
             the respondent in seeking payment, it is my determination that
             the rejection of the appellant's application on 28 October was
             not an immigration decision within the meaning of the 2002 Act
             and this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal
             in respect of that rejection.

 4. The judge went on to say [31]:

         31.  At the date of the second application, 6  November  2015,  the
             appellant's leave to remain had already expired.  There  being
             no valid extant leave to be extended, the  rejection  of  that
             application was also not an  immigration  decision  under  the
             2002 Act which the appellant can appeal.

 5. At the  appeal  hearing  at  Field  House  on  19  December  2017,  the
    appellant's representative  attended  the  hearing  late  and,  in  her
    absence, I heard from the appellant in person.  She referred  us  to  a
    letter dated 4 May 2017 from TSB addressed to  the  appellant  herself.
    Part of this letter reads:

         Having checked your account, I confirm that there was no payment of
         ï¿½601 made during the dates of 18 October 2014 to 28  October  2014.
         I understand that you held sufficient funds in your account  during
         these dates to cover  the  payment  amount  however  there  was  no
         attempt to take a payment from your account during these dates.

 6. Obviously, this letter was not before Judge Brewer who heard the appeal
    in April 2017.  He cannot, therefore, be criticised for failing to have
    any regard to the content of a letter which had not been written by the
    date of the hearing.  Having said that,  the  overriding  duty  of  the
    Tribunal is to determine this appeal fairly.   I  consider  the  letter
    from the TSB does resolve the question which was before the  First-tier
    Tribunal which  the  judge  (having  no  better  evidence  before  him)
    determined  against  the  appellant,  that  is  whether  or   not   the
    appellant's bank had rejected payment.   It is apparent from the letter
    that the bank did not reject payment but, for  whatever  administrative
    or technical reason, the respondent had  not  sought  payment  from  an
    account which  had  held  sufficient  funds  to  meet  payment  of  the
    application fee.  In the light of my duty  to  deal  with  this  appeal
    fairly and intending no criticism whatever  of  Judge  Brewer,  I  have
    decided to set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision.  I find on the
    evidence that the appellant did make a  valid  application  in  October
    2014 and that that application should not have been rejected  for  non-
    payment of the fee.  The consequence of that finding is that  appellant
    did have leave to remain when she  appealed  against  her  decision  to
    refuse her application.  I determine the jurisdiction issue  in  favour
    of the appellant and, referring to [11] of Judge Brewer's decision,  it
    is necessary for there to be a proper determination of  the  appeal  on
    its merits.  I consider that that process is better  conducted  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal, to which this appeal is now returned.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal need not consider  again  the  question  of  jurisdiction
    which the Upper Tribunal has now resolved in favour of  the  appellant.
    Instead, the First-tier Tribunal should proceed to address the  reasons
    for the refusal of the  appellant's  application  as  detailed  in  the
    second letter of the respondent dated 31 March 2015 together  with  the
    appellant's grounds for challenging that decision.



Notice of Decision

 7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  was  promulgated  on  24
    April 2017 is set aside.  None of the findings  of  fact  shall  stand.
    The appeal is returned to the First-tier Tribunal  (not  Judge  Brewer)
    for that Tribunal to remake the decision.

 8. No anonymity direction is made.
