                                  DECISION

Introduction

    1. Although it is the Secretary of State who is appealing in these
       proceedings, for convenience I will refer hereinafter to the parties
       as in the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. The appellant is a national of Yemen, born in October 1972. He made a
       claim for protection in June 2008 which was unsuccessful. His appeal
       was dismissed. That appeal was heard before Immigration Judge Lyons
       on 14 August 2008. The decision recorded that the appellant said he
       left Yemen in June 2002 in order to study in Cuba. He arrived at
       Gatwick in June 2008 on a transit visa and decided to remain. He made
       a claim for protection several days later. He said he had been an
       officer in the Yemeni army and had been sponsored to study in Cuba.
       He obtained two degrees. He returned to Yemen in 2007 to visit
       family. At that time there were demonstrations taking place in
       respect of the political situation and he decided to attend. He was
       subsequently detained. His family were able to obtain his release
       primary. He then returned to Cuba to continue his studies. He claimed
       he was due to return when his brother advised him that arrest
       warrants had been issued.

    3. Immigration Judge Lyons did not accept the account. The objective
       evidence did not confirm the large demonstration the appellant
       described. The judge found his being released highly improbable, as
       was his ability to leave Yemen on his own documentation; to resume
       his studies and to continue to receive payment as soldier. The judge
       also found his failure to claim immediately called into question his
       credibility.

    4. He subsequently made various further submissions which were
       unsuccessful. The last of these formed the subject matter of the
       proceedings before First-tier Tribunal Judge AJ Parker. In the
       interval the appellant had married a British national and they had a
       child. Furthermore, there had been an escalation of events in Yemen
       with the respondent's country policy note of June 2017 referring to a
       state of armed conflict in parts of the country. The appellant's home
       area was affected and the further submission was to the effect it
       would be unreasonable to expect him to relocate elsewhere.

    5. The refusal letter accepted that the appellant was entitled to leave
       to remain on the basis of his family life. In respect of his claim
       for protection the letter referred to the earlier refusals and the
       rejection of his claim of political activity both in Yemen and in the
       United Kingdom. Reference was made to the Devaseelan principle. The
       respondent also referred to its country policy note which not find a
       15 C risk. There was reference to country conditions including a
       cholera outbreak.

The First tier Tribunal

    6. The appeal was listed before First-tier Tribunal Judge AJ Parker at
       Manchester on 12 October 2018.There is  a fax on file from a Mr Goy,
       an executive officer with the Home Office, to the tribunal in
       Manchester dated 12 October 2018 . It states that the presenting
       officer had called in sick 10 minutes earlier and there was no
       replacement available. Consequently, an adjournment application was
       requested for two protection appeals including the present.

    7. In the decision, the judge at paragraph 10 referred to the absence of
       the presenting officer and was aware that one had been arranged but
       they had suddenly become unwell. The judge then referred to the 2014
       Procedural Rules as well as the decision of Nwiange (adjournment
       fairness) [2014] UKIAT 000412. Miss Patel who then appeared for the
       appellant, as she does now, objected to the proceedings being
       adjourned. She referred to the fact the appeal had been adjourned in
       July and that further delay would incur expense and would be
       injurious to the appellant's mental health. The judge decided not to
       adjourn and took the view that the appeal did not turn upon the
       appellant's credibility but upon the current situation in Yemen.

    8. The judge referred to the earlier rejection of his claimed political
       activities. The judge records Ms Patel as stating that the appellant
       was not relying on this but on who he was and where he was from. At
       paragraph 25 the judge referred to the respondent's guidance that
       there was no 15 C risk but stated that the country's President had
       left.

    9. At paragraph 28 the judge concluded that the appellant would be at
       risk in his home area because of an imputed political opinion as he
       was not aligned with either of the fighting factions. At paragraph 45
       the judge referred to the appellant having a profile which would
       place him at risk. The judge concluded that relocation would be
       unduly harsh and travel into and around the country was difficult.
       Then, at paragraph 47, the judge found he was entitled to
       humanitarian protection under article 15 C and that he would be
       particularly affected because of his profile. However in the decision
       notice the judge did not allow the appeal under the Qualification
       Directive but did under the Refugee Convention.

The Upper Tribunal

   10. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the
       judge erred in not adjourning the appeal in circumstance. The
       Secretary of State raised other grounds including a failure to give
       reasons.

   11. At hearing, Mr Bates pointed out that the adjournment issue had not
       been raised in the grounds. He sought to explain this by saying that
       the drafter would not have had the file. However, he suggested this
       was a Robinson obvious point. He pointed out that the judge was aware
       the Secretary of State had intended to be represented but for the
       presenting officer falling ill. He explained that the First-tier
       Tribunal hearing centre in Manchester is busy, with perhaps 7 courts
       operating. Whilst ideally they should be 100% representation, because
       of the lack of manpower this was not possible. They targeted key
       cases, one of which was the present. He submitted that this type of
       case was not one where a presenting officer, even if one were
       available, could rapidly assimilate but would need time to prepare.
       It was impractical to call upon presenting officers from other
       centres at short notice simply because of the logistics.

   12. He referred to statements in the decision which lacked logic. For
       instance, the reference at paragraph 25 to the country's President
       leaving as supporting a 15 C risk. The judge had indicated that the
       appeal did not turn upon the appellant's credibility but upon the
       country situation. However, there was no extant country guidance
       case. Furthermore, the decision required consideration of the
       appellant's credibility as the appeal outcome is based upon a
       political opinion being imputed to him. I was referred to paragraph
       45 with the judge describing the appellant as having told a
       consistent account supported by objective evidence but had provided
       no reasoning. This applied in respect of paragraph 24 and 25.

   13. Ms Patel relied upon her rule 24 response. She submitted that the
       judge had been even handed in that he had considered the question of
       internal relocation even though not been raised in the refusal
       letter.

Conclusions

   14. The judge materially erred in the circumstance in not adjourning.
       Whilst judges aim to work efficiently and advanced cases this must
       not be at the expense of fairness. The decision of the judge
       indicates an over reliance upon the rules rather than the notion of
       fairness set out in Nwiange (adjournment fairness) [2014] UKIAT
       000412. The question is whether the refusal deprived the affected
       party of his right to a fair hearing. Where an adjournment refusal is
       challenged on fairness grounds the question for the Upper Tribunal is
       not whether the FtT acted reasonably. Rather, the test to be applied
       is that of fairness: was there any deprivation of the affected
       party's right to a fair hearing? In my view that clearly was. This
       ground alone justifies a finding of a material error of law.

   15. The judge refers to a need to be fair to both parties. However, I
       find the comments at paragraph 14 questionable. The judge suggests
       that if roles were reversed and Counsel for the appellant became
       suddenly ill the presenting officer would ask that the case proceed,
       suggesting another Counsel could take over. This seems highly
       improbable where the unavailability is at the last minute and the
       case is not straightforward.

   16. I appreciate that in some cases the Secretary of State decides not to
       arrange representation. However, in the present instance it was clear
       the intention was to arrange representation. As Mr Bates indicated,
       with manpower restrictions the Secretary of State is selective in the
       cases where representation will be arranged. Given that this was a
       protection claim and there had been an earlier appeal then this is
       understandable.

   17. The decision itself is not adequately reason. The fact the President
       of the country has fled does not mean that the citizens therefore
       would succeed in a claim for protection or the existence of a 15 C
       risk. There was a material before the judge about the ongoing
       conflict but the judge did not give reasons for concluding the 15 C
       risk existed when the respondent's guidance was to the contrary. The
       judge also does not set out how the appellant would have a particular
       profile and how this would place him at risk. The decision is also
       contradictory with the judge in the body of the decision referring to
       a 15 C risk and yet not allowing the appeal under the Qualification
       Directive. I find these deficiencies also amount to a material error
       of law.

Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge AJ Parker materially errs in law
and is set aside. The matter is remitted for a de novo rehearing in the
First-tier Tribunal before a different judge.
