Representation:

For the claimant: Not represented
For the appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Khan  promulgated  19.10.15,  dismissing  on
    immigration grounds but allowing on human rights grounds the claimant's
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State,  dated  10.2.15,
    to refuse his application made on 18.10.14 for leave to remain  in  the
    UK on the basis of private life and to remove him from the UK  pursuant
    to section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 24.9.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ransley  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    4.4.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 26.5.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out herein, I found such error of law in the making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Khan to be set aside and remade, which I do by dismissing  the
    appeal on all grounds.

 5. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    claimant came to the UK in 2009 to study English and then to  pursue  a
    law degree, with the intention of qualifying as  a  barrister.  He  had
    valid leave until 26.10.14. He  has  completed  2  years  of  a  3-year
    undergraduate law degree course at the University of London. He  failed
    and would have to re-sit  some  modules  of  his  course  in  order  to
    complete the course.

 6. On 18.10.14, within extant leave, he applied for leave to  remain.  The
    covering letter with the application explained that he was applying for
    leave to remain outside the Rules on the basis of private life.  It  is
    clear that his intention in making this application was to be  able  to
    continue his studies in the UK. However, he did not have a Confirmation
    of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) from an educational  sponsor  and  thus
    could not apply as a Tier 4 student migrant.

 7. The application was considered by the Secretary  of  State  under  both
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE, which are the  Secretary  of  State's
    proportionate response to private and family life claims. He  does  not
    appear to have any family life in the UK and as he had only been in the
    UK for 4 years and 11 months at the date of decision, he could not meet
    the requirements for  leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  length  of
    residence.  Neither  was  he  able  to  demonstrate  very   significant
    obstacles to his integration in Bangladesh, where he spent most of  his
    life and continues to have strong ties.

 8.  The  Secretary  of  State  also  found  no  exceptional   (compelling)
    circumstances in his desire to continue to study in the UK. It was open
    to  him  to  continue  his  study  in  Bangladesh,  or  to  make  fresh
    application from Bangladesh for entry clearance to the UK as a student.



 9. Judge Khan found that the appellant could not meet the requirements  of
    the Rules, either as a student or on the basis of private and/or family
    life and that decision must stand. Judge Khan specifically found at  �9
    that the appellant failed to show very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration in Bangladesh.

10. However, from �10  Judge  Khan  considered  the  appellant's  claim  of
    exceptional and compassionate circumstances. It is clear that the Judge
    was sympathetic  to  the  appellant's  plight  and  from  �11  and  �12
    considered that it would  be  unfair  to  prevent  the  appellant  from
    completing his  degree  course,  as  he  was  due  to  take  his  final
    examinations in a few days' time,  and  that  it  was  also  unfair  to
    prevent him from re-sitting the Bar Transfer Test subjects  he  failed,
    in May 2016, "as he is almost there, so to  speak...  In  my  view,  to
    force him to return to Bangladesh at considerable expense  to  make  an
    application for re-entry as a student in order to complete his  studies
    which he has nearly completed would neither be fair nor reasonable  and
    against commonsense (sic). It is unfortunate that due to  no  fault  of
    the appellant, he was unable to obtain  a  CAS.  I  am  satisfied  that
    exceptional and compelling circumstances exist  outside  the  Rules  in
    relation to the facts of the appellant's case whereby he is entitled to
    succeed under Article 8 in order for him to be  able  to  complete  his
    studies and to return to his home  country.  The  consequences  in  not
    being able to do so would be unduly harsh."

11. With respect to Judge Khan, and for the reasons  set  out  below,  that
    finding was in error of law.

12. Article 8 provides that:


           "Everyone has the right to respect for his  private  and  family
           life, his home and his correspondence.


           "There shall be no interference by a public authority  with  the
           exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with  the
           law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
           national security, public safety or the economic  well-being  of
           the country, for the prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the
           protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the
           rights and freedoms of others."


13. At paragraph 17 of Razgar v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2004] UKHL 27, Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated:


           "In considering whether a challenge to the Secretary of  State's
           decision to remove a person must  clearly  fail,  the  reviewing
           court must, as it seems to me, consider how an appeal  would  be
           likely  to  fare  before  an  adjudicator,   as   the   Tribunal
           responsible for deciding the appeal if  there  were  an  appeal.
           This means that the reviewing court must ask itself  essentially
           the questions which would have to be answered by an adjudicator.
           In a case where removal is resisted in reliance  on  Article  8,
           these questions are likely to be:

                  (1) Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a
                 public body with the exercise of the applicant's  right  to
                 respect for his private or (as  the  case  may  be)  family
                 life?
                 (2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such
                 gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of  Article
                 8?
                  (3) If so, is such interference  in  accordance  with  the
                 law?

                  (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic
                 society in  the  interests  of  national  security,  public
                 safety or the economic well-being of the country,  for  the
                 prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the  protection  of
                 health or morals, or for the protection of the  rights  and
                 freedoms of others?


                  (5) If so,  is  such  interference  proportionate  to  the
                 legitimate public end sought to be achieved?"


14. However, before article 8 ECHR can be considered outside the Rules  the
    claimant must demonstrate that  there  are  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances insufficiently recognised in the Rules so as  to  justify
    granting leave to remain outside Rules under article  8  ECHR,  on  the
    basis that the decision is unjustifiably harsh. In SSHD v SS (Congo)  &
    Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387, the Court of Appeal re-stated the context  and
    considered the role of public policy as expressed in the Rules  in  the
    proportionality assessment. The decision maker is  entitled  to  decide
    that Article 8 considerations have been fully addressed  in  the  Rules
    when dealing with 'stage two'.  If they have, it is enough to  say  so.
    This will necessarily involve deciding whether there is a 'gap' between
    the Rules and Article 8, and then whether there  are  circumstances  in
    the case under consideration which take it outside the class  of  cases
    which the Rules properly provide for.  Whether these circumstances  are
    described  as  'compelling'  or  'exceptional'  is  not  a  matter   of
    substance.  They must be relevant, weighty, and not fully provided  for
    within the Rules.  In practice they are likely to  be  both  compelling
    and exceptional, but this is not a legal requirement.  The first stage,
    therefore, is to assess how completely  the  Rules  reflect  Article  8
    considerations.


15. I find the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  identify  any  rationally
    identifiable  compelling  reasons  inadequately  recognised  under  the
    Immigration Rules so as to justify granting leave to remain outside the
    Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR private and/or  family  life.  The
    Rules provide a fair and comprehensive framework to enable students  to
    pursue study in the UK and for extension of leave. That system includes
    the requirements to have a CAS and to meet  other  specific  evidential
    requirements. Whatever sympathy one  might  have  for  the  appellant's
    predicament, article 8 does not grant a right of education.

16. As Judge Ransley found arguable when granting permission to appeal,  in
    allowing the appeal  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge failed to apply the relevant case law  of  Nasim  &  Ors
    (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC), limiting the ambit of a  student's
    private life engagement with article 8 ECHR.

17. In Nasim,  the  Upper  Tribunal  considered  whether  the  hypothetical
    removal of the 22 PBS claimants, pursuant to the decision to refuse  to
    vary leave, would violate the UK's obligations under  article  8  ECHR.
    Whilst each case must be determined on its merits, the  Tribunal  noted
    that the judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel  and  Others  v  SSHD
    [2013] UKSC 72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and  purpose
    of article 8  of  the  ECHR  and,  in  particular,  to  recognise  that
    article's limited utility in private life cases that  are  far  removed
    from the protection of an individual's moral and physical integrity."

18. The panel considered at length article 8 in the  context  of  work  and
    studies. The respondent's case was that none of  the  appellants  could
    demonstrate removal would have such grave  consequences  as  to  engage
    article 8. �57 of Patel stated,  "It  is  important  to  remember  that
    article 8 is not a general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished
    from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
    outside the rules, which  may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected  human
    right... The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course
    in this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself a
    right protected under article 8."

19. At �14 of Nasim [2014], the panel stated:

         "Whilst the concept  of  a  "family  life"  is  generally  speaking
         readily identifiable, the concept  of  a  "private  life"  for  the
         purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear.  At one end of  the
         "continuum" stands the concept of moral and physical  integrity  or
         "physical and psychological integrity" (as categorised by the ECtHR
         in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1)  as  to  which,  in
         extreme instances, even the state's interest  in  removing  foreign
         criminals might not constitute a proportionate response.   However,
         as one moves down the continuum, one encounters aspects of  private
         life which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not  alone,  then  in
         combination with other factors) are so far removed from the  "core"
         of Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state  interests,  such
         as the importance of maintaining a credible and coherent system  of
         immigration control."

20. The panel pointed out that at this point on the continuum,

         "the essential elements of the private life relied on will normally
         be transposable, in the sense of being capable  of  replication  in
         their essential respects, following a person's return to their home
         country, (�15)" and (�20) recognised "its  limited  utility  to  an
         individual where one has  moved  along  the  continuum,  from  that
         Article's core area of operation towards what might be described as
         its fuzzy penumbra. The limitation arises, both from what  will  at
         that point normally be the tangential effect on the  individual  of
         the proposed interference and from the fact that, unless there  are
         particular reasons to  reduce  the  public  interest  of  enforcing
         immigration controls, that interest will  consequently  prevail  in
         striking the proportionality balance (even assuming that  stage  is
         reached)."

21. Applying that law to the present case, whilst each case must be decided
    on its own facts, the desire of the appellant to  continue  studies  in
    the UK does not on the facts of this case engage article 8 private life
    at all. As has been pointed out,  he  is  free  to  pursue  studies  in
    Bangladesh or elsewhere, or to make a fresh  application  from  outside
    the UK for entry clearance for that purpose. It is not essential to his
    right to a private life that he be permitted to continue studies in the
    UK and the right to education is not protected under article 8. In  the
    circumstances, it is difficult to see how any compelling  circumstances
    could be identified on the  facts  of  this  case  that  would  justify
    granting leave to remain outside the Rules on the basis  of  article  8
    ECHR. There is no credible article 8 claim in this case.

22. Further, I find that there  was  nothing  procedurally  unfair  in  the
    application of the Rules to the  appellant's  circumstances,  when  the
    Rules provide a fair and coherent system of immigration control. It  is
    not the fault or responsibility of  the  Secretary  of  State  that  he
    failed his examinations  or  that  he  failed  to  obtain  a  CAS.  The
    Secretary of State is not obliged to permit  students  to  study  until
    they  pass  examinations,  or  enable  them   to   accomplish   certain
    qualifications or life ambitions.

23. In Marghia (procedural fairness) [2014] UKUT  00366  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal held that the common law duty of fairness is essentially about
    procedural fairness. There is no absolute duty at common  law  to  make
    decisions which are  substantially  "fair,"  and  the  court  will  not
    interfere unless the decision in question fall foul of  the  Wednesbury
    test, i.e. that no reasonable decision-maker or public body could  have
    arrived at such a decision.

24. In EK (Ivory Coast) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1517, the  Court  of  Appeal
    was dealing with an appellant whose CAS had expired by the date of  the
    Secretary of State's decision. The Court held at �25 that there was  no
    breach of the public law duty to act fairly, stating, "The Secretary of
    State is not responsible for the general unfairness which the appellant
    has suffered. That is  the  result  of  actions  and  omissions  by  St
    Stephen's. There is no basis on which  any  of  the  decisions  of  the
    Secretary of State, the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal  can
    be impugned as unlawful." It was  also  held  that  fairness  does  not
    require the Secretary  of  State  to  correct  applications,  or  delay
    decisions to enquire about a CAS.

25. As Judge Ransley also found arguable, when considering  article  8  the
    judge also failed to apply section 117B of the 2002 Act, to the  effect
    that little weight should be given to a private life developed  in  the
    UK when the claimant's immigration status was at all times  precarious.
    AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) held, inter alia, that:

    (3)          Parliament has now drawn a sharp distinction  between  any
    period of time during which a person has been in the  UK  "unlawfully",
    and any period of time during which that person's immigration status in
    the UK was merely "precarious".

     (4)          Those who at any given date held a precarious immigration
    status must have held at that date an otherwise lawful grant  of  leave
    to enter or to remain. A person's immigration status is "precarious" if
    their continued presence  in  the  UK  will  be  dependent  upon  their
    obtaining a further grant of leave.

26. The appellant's immigration status was at all times precarious and thus
    little weight should have attached to any private life developed in the
    UK.

27. In any event, article 8 ECHR is not  a  general  dispensing  power  for
    those who do not meet the requirements of the Rules, but  that  appears
    to be what the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  in  this  case,  which
    amounted to an error of law.

28. On the facts of this case, even as set out in the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal, it was inevitable that the application would be  refused
    and the appeal should have been dismissed.

Conclusions:

29. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The claimant's appeal has been dismissed.
