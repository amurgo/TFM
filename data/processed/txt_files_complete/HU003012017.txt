For the Appellant:     Ms S Iqbal, counsel instructed by Makka Solicitors
Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Pakistan, date of birth 14 November  1971,
    had appealed against a Secretary of State's decision to refuse leave to
    remain on 8 December 2016.  His appeal came before First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Samimi who allowed the appeal on 15 March 2018.  The Secretary of
    State challenged that decision and on 23 January 2019  I  published  my
    decision in which I set aside  the  Original  Tribunal's  decision  and
    directed for the matter to be re-made in the Upper Tribunal.

2.   At the hearing before me I identified the two issues to  be  addressed.
    First, whether or not the Appellant had, as the Respondent had  argued,
    used a proxy test taker to take his ETS TOEIC test.  Secondly,  whether
    or not considerations outside of the Rules gave rise  to  circumstances
    that indicated Article 8 ECHR was engaged and whether or  not,  in  the
    circumstances, the Respondent's decision was proportionate, at least in
    terms of its impact upon the Appellant's wife.   The  Appellant's  wife
    was a Jamaican national, date of birth 26 June 1991  from  Jamaica  and
    her name was [RS].

3.   The Appellant's wife is entered into a marriage with the Appellant  and
    essentially argued for her part that she has no wish to go and live  in
    Pakistan and that expecting her to do so would simply be  a  breach  of
    her human rights and would so adversely impact upon her that  it  would
    be utterly disproportionate.

4.   At the hearing of the appeal it had been conceded  that  the  Appellant
    had married his wife on 5 March 2015 and that  they  had  undergone  an
    Islamic marriage at a mosque.  The Appellant's wife was not  a  Muslim,
    but Christian, and has no experience or knowledge of life  in  Pakistan
    as a woman or indeed as a spouse.

5.   The Appellant's wife was granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  23
    February 2011 and works as a care worker.  She was effectively the sole
    source of income for her husband and herself.  As a care worker she did
    not and still does not earn ï¿½18,600 which would be the  required  level
    of maintenance for her and her husband were he to apply  to  return  to
    the UK from Pakistan and seek a spousal visa.

6.   In terms of the taking of the TOEIC test a statement  was  produced  by
    the Secretary of State and all the generic evidence produced in the ETS
    cases including the look-up tool, the evidence of Professor French  and
    of the witnesses Collings and Millington, as well as the relevant  case
    law of SM and Qadir [2016] UKUT 00229, Shehzad [2016] EWCA Civ 615  and
    MA [2016] UKUT 00450.  Those matters have been further supplemented  by
    the case of Qadir and Majumder [2016] EWCA Civ 1167.

7.   The explanation that the Appellant had given  in  connection  with  the
    taking of the test in the face of the generic evidence, which  asserted
    he had not, was that essentially he had taken the test. When the matter
    came to be considered by the Judge [D3-5] the  evidence  had  not  been
    substantively criticised.  Thus, the Appellant had  given  evidence  of
    him having previously taken an IELTS test, categorically rejecting  the
    suggestion of using a proxy test taker and essentially urging that  his
    English language  abilities  before  he  took  the  test  were  a  fair
    indicator of his actual abilities.  He iterated his arguments  that  he
    had taken the TOEIC test himself.  Although his wife  was  not  present
    when he undertook the TOEIC test she  was  essentially  supporting  his
    position.  The Judge found that the Appellant and his wife had  in  the
    course of  their  evidence  been  truthful  and  consistent  witnesses.
    Accordingly the Judge accepted that the Appellant had not used a  proxy
    test taker.

8.     More importantly, unchallenged by the Secretary of  State,  was  that
    the Judge went on to address the evidence of the Appellant and his wife
    concerning their families, their relationships,  living  circumstances,
    and the genuineness and  subsistence  of  their  marriage.   The  Judge
    stated [D16]:

         "... I find that given the Appellant's wife's ethnic background  as
         a Jamaican, this is a  matter  that  would  attract  discrimination
         against the couple's interfaith/interethnic marriage.  ...  I  find
         the Appellant's wife who is a British citizen of Jamaican ethnicity
         would be subject to discriminatory  treatment  on  account  of  the
         couple's interfaith marriage.  I find that on balance it is  likely
         that she will be subjected to harassment and find it  difficult  to
         find a job in an environment where mixed  marriages  are  rare.   I
         find that the social attitudes towards interfaith  and  mixed  race
         marriage together with  cultural  and  social  isolation  that  the
         Appellant  will  inevitably  suffer  will   create   insurmountable
         obstacle (sic) and undue hardship to the Appellant's wife's ability
         to integrate to a family and private life in Pakistan".

9.      The Judge continued [D17]:

         "In the alternative, I find that having regard to Article 8 of  the
         ECHR, given the fact that the Appellant's family and  private  life
         has been established in the United Kingdom over the course  of  the
         entirety of her life are factors that I attach considerable  weight
         to,  and  which  I  find  does  render  the   Appellant's   removal
         disproportionate to the public  interest  of  immigration  control.
         The evidence given by the Appellant and his  wife  makes  it  clear
         that if the Appellant did apply for  entry  clearance  from  abroad
         they would, with the assistance of their  friend  who  has  offered
         third party support ... be able to meet the financial  requirements
         of the Rules".

    The Judge allowed the appeal as well under Article 8 ECHR,  albeit  the
    appeal was only being made, and could only be made, under the ECHR  and
    not on the basis of the Immigration Rules.

10.  I concluded that the Judge was entitled to come to  the  view  that  he
    did in relation to the taking of the TOEIC test and the use of a  proxy
    test taker.  The explanation the Appellant gave of that matter did  not
    get close to showing that there was an innocent explanation or that the
    evidential burden of proof had  shifted  back  to  the  Respondent.   I
    concluded that the evidence when looked again simply  showed  that  the
    explanation tendered really did not get close to being fairly described
    as an innocent explanation.

11.  However, I agreed with the Judge that the position faced  by  women  in
    Pakistan was of itself recognised as problematic, and  returning  as  a
    partner in a mixed marriage relationship  as  well  as  being  a  mixed
    religious partnership, of a lady to Punjab, who  has  no  knowledge  of
    Punjabi, no evident options to find employment  in  her  area  of  work
    which is remunerated, nor is there anything to indicate the  likelihood
    of acceptance within the community of women in Pakistan that gives rise
    to the real concern that the Appellant would not find integration  with
    his wife a practical reality and that she would face  isolation  and  a
    lack of opportunity as well as the obvious constraints on dress, custom
    and expected conduct of women in Pakistan.

12.  In reaching the findings I was assisted by the Country Information  and
    Guidance on interfaith marriage  2016,  family  gender  violence  2016,
    Pakistan Christian and Christian converts 2018, two  articles  in  2016
    and 2018 on interfaith relationships and Women in Pakistan.

13.  Accordingly, I concluded in the light of the material  before  me  that
    the evidence showed that the appeal should be allowed on Article 8 ECHR
    grounds and it was disproportionate in terms  of  the  interference  in
    family life. The Respondent's expectation  that  the  Appellant's  wife
    could have a reasonable life in  Pakistan  was  not  made  out  on  the
    evidence before me or the Judge.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The appeal is allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

ANONYMITY

No anonymity order was sought nor is one required.

FEE AWARD

The appeal  has  succeeded  much  in  the  light  of  the  particular  later
information  provided  concerning  the  Article  8   issues   and   in   the
circumstances, I do not find that a fee award is appropriate.
