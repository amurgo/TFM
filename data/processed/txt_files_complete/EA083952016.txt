                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms M Ahamed of RMS Immigration Ltd.
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is  an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Shaerf promulgated on 9 August 2017.

2.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge declined to engage  with  the  facts  and
    issues in the appeal in reliance upon the case of Sala (EFMs: right  of
    appeal) Albania [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC), dismissing the appeal for want
    of jurisdiction.

3.   The decision in Sala has since been overturned in the Court  of  Appeal
    in the case of MK v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 1755.  Mr Clarke readily conceded on behalf of the  Respondent
    that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be  set  aside  for
    error of law and the appeal be re-made by way of a hearing  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal with all issues under the EEA Regulations at large.
    Ms Ahamed indicated that this was the outcome sought by the Appellant.

4.   I observe that it seems to me that the appeal can now be heard  by  any
    Judge - including Judge Shaerf who, not having engaged in  any  of  the
    facts and issues, is not in any way disqualified from  now  looking  at
    the case afresh.  Notwithstanding this  observation,  it  may  be  that
    Listing may wish to consider putting the case in front of  a  different
    Judge.

Notice of Decision

5.   The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is vitiated for error of law.

6.   The decision in the appeal  is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by any Judge with all issues at large.

7.   No anonymity direction is sought or made.


Signed:                                 Date: 3 April 2018

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge I A Lewis
