                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

      1. The appellant has been given permission to appeal the decision of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Brookefield who in a decision promulgated
         on 25th August 2017 dismissed his appeal against the respondent's
         refusal of his application for leave to remain. That application
         was based upon his family and private life.

      2. He is a national of Jamaica, born on 27 December 1979. He married
         Ms [MG] in Jamaica in 2014. She is a British citizen. He came here
         on 20 June 2015 on a visit Visa to see her. She has a daughter,
         [IG], born on 28 December 2008 from a previous relationship.

      3. On 27th November 2015 he made his application for further leave to
         remain. He said that his wife health's health had deteriorated and
         so he decided to remain behind. She had suffered a stroke in 2010
         and subsequently develop anxiety and depression. She had been
         threatened in August 2016 by her older daughter's ex-partner who
         produced a handgun. The appellant's wife give evidence at his trial
         and he was imprisoned for 5 ï¿½ years. The appellant's wife was
         pregnant at the time and miscarried in November 2016.

      4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Brookefield referred to the appellant not
         meeting the relevant immigration rules in appendix FM. As he
         entered as a visitor the provisions of paragraph EX 1 did not
         apply. Regarding his private life, he had only been here a short
         time and he has close family in Jamaica. The judge accepted that
         article 8 was engaged in relation to his wife and referred to the
         public interest factors in section 117 B. The appellant had a
         limited command of English and was reliant upon his wife for
         financial support and accommodation. She in turn was in receipt of
         State benefits and was unemployed.

      5. The judge pointed out that the appellant had never sought to gain
         entry clearance under appendix FM to be with his wife. The medical
         evidence indicated that fortunately there were no residual effects
         from her stroke and there was no apparent reason why she could not
         accompany her husband to Jamaica. She has visited Jamaica in 2013,
         2014 and 2015 as had her daughter.

      6. The judge referred to a lack of contact between her daughter and
         her biological father. Ms [G] has 3 adult children and a grandchild
         in the United Kingdom who are leading independent lives.
         Consequently, the judge concluded she could either go to Jamaica
         with the appellant or support an application from here for his
         entry. Regarding private life, the view was this could be
         replicated in Jamaica.

The Upper Tribunal

      7. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the
         judge failed to consider the proportionality of the decision in
         light of his wife's health and whether it would be reasonable to
         expect her youngest daughter to leave the United Kingdom, she being
         British. The grounds contend that her child is a qualifying child
         within the immigration rules and section 117 B6 applies. This is in
         addition to the obligation to consider her best interests further
         to section 55.

      8. At hearing, Mr Brown said there had been no engagement by the judge
         with section 117B (6) in relation to his wife's daughter. He made
         the point that there was no challenge to the genuineness of the
         appellant's relationship with her. He also pointed out there had
         been no reference to section 55. He submitted that because of this
         the decision was defective and would have to be remade. He said
         that the appellant's wife's medical condition had deteriorated and
         would be necessary to arrange for the medical evidence about this.
         Mr Tan acknowledged there was force in the points made.

Consideration

      9. First-tier Tribunal Judge Brookefield considered the appellant's
         position in relation to his wife initially through the prism of the
         rules. The judge accepted the existence of family life. The judge
         recorded the history of the relationship and his wife's medical
         conditions. The judge also had regard to section 117 B factors in
         relation to the appellant. However, the bulk of the decision is
         focused upon the appellant and there is very little reference to
         his stepdaughter. She appears to be very much an add-on to a
         consideration of his wife's position and the reasonableness of her
         going to live in Jamaica or supporting an application made by him
         for settlement.

     10. A similar approach is taken in relation to private life. The judge
         at para 9 (xvii) briefly refers to his stepdaughter, suggesting she
         could resume her education in Jamaica and make new friends.

     11. It is clear that the decision fails to adequately consider his
         stepdaughter's position as a unique entity. There is no reference
         to her relationship with the appellant. In fairness to the judge
         this appears to be precipitated by initial application and the tone
         of the refusal letter which also focuses upon his wife rather than
         his stepdaughter. The grounds of appeal do not raise his
         stepdaughter as a specific separate consideration and it is not
         clear from the decision if this was argued before the judge.
         Whatever the background may be however there is an obligation upon
         the judge to take into account the section 55 considerations and
         her special position as a child.

     12. Because she is not referred to in the earlier material it is not
         clear if the respondent is accepting a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with her. However, Mr Brown has indicated he was
         proceeding on the basis that this was not disputed and Mr Tan did
         not say to the contrary.

Decision

The decision materially errs in law by not adequately considering the
position of the appellant's stepdaughter. Consequently, I set the decision
aside and remitted for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.
