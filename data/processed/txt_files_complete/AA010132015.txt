Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr O James, instructed by Asylum Justice


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I make an anonymity order under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended)  to  protect  the
    identity of the appellant's child.  This order prohibits the disclosure
    directly or indirectly (including by the parties) of  the  identity  of
    the appellant.  Any disclosure in breach of this order may amount to  a
    contempt of court.  This order shall remain in force unless revoked  or
    varied by a Tribunal or Court.

Introduction

 2. The Secretary of State appeals against a  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge M M Thomas) allowing the appeal of JA  (hereafter  "the
    claimant") under Art 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The claimant is a citizen of Afghanistan who was born on [ ] 1995.   He
    came to the UK on 18 May 2011 and claimed asylum two days later.  On 12
    October 2011 his application for asylum was refused but he was  granted
    discretionary leave until 9 January 2013 when he reached the age of 17ï¿½
    years.

 4. On 28 December 2012, the claimant applied for further leave.  That  was
    refused in a decision dated 2 January 2015.  On 6 January  2015,  as  a
    consequence, the Secretary of State  refused  to  vary  the  claimant's
    leave.  The claimant appealed that decision to the First-tier Tribunal.



 5. The judge dismissed the appeal on asylum  and  humanitarian  protection
    grounds.  The judge did not accept that he would be at risk  on  return
    to  Afghanistan  as  a  result  of  his  father's  political  activity.
    Likewise, the judge concluded that the claimant could not succeed under
    Art 15(c) of the Qualification  Directive.   Those  decisions  are  not
    challenged.

 6. However, the Judge allowed the claimant's  appeal  under  Art  8  on  a
    limited basis.  That basis was that the claimant's child ("K") was  the
    subject of care proceedings in  the  family  court  and  that,  in  the
    judge's view, merited a grant of a short period of discretionary  leave
    to JA until the care  proceedings,  in  which  he  was  involved,  were
    determined.

 7. On 25 November 2015, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Adio)  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  against
    Judge Thomas' decision to allow the appeal under Art 8  on  the  ground
    that the judge had failed to follow the guidance in RS (Immigration and
    family court proceedings) India [2012] UKUT 00218 (IAC).

 8. In response, the claimant filed a detailed rule 24 response seeking  to
    uphold the judge's decision on the basis that it was in line  with  the
    guidance in RS at [43].

 9. Thus, the appeal came before me.

The Judge's Decision

10. In respect of the claimant's case  under  Art  8,  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied that the claimant could succeed on the basis of  his  private
    life in the UK under para 276ADE(1).

11. However, the judge went on to consider Art 8 and the  position  of  the
    claimant in respect of his son, K.  The evidence before the  judge  was
    that there were ongoing care proceedings in relation to K  who  was  in
    foster care.

12. The evidence concerning the claimant's continued involvement with K  is
    set out in para 52 of the determination as follows:

         "52.     The supplemental Refusal letter confirms that [K] has been
             in foster care since 19 March 2015.  It further  advises  that
             care proceedings are ongoing but arrangements have  been  made
             for the Appellant to have supervised contact with his son once
             a week.  The letter states that to date that contact has  been
             'sporadic'.  The letter also raises an  issue  with  potential
             paternity however, that issue is still  outstanding  according
             to the supplemental Refusal letter.  I also refer to the email
             from Rachel  Edmunds,  social  worker  dated  6  October  2015
             (document A1) which very much repeats what is set  out  within
             the  supplemental  Refusal  letter  however  that  email  also
             indicates that the Appellant has attended 'approximately  half
             of the contact sessions offered to date'.  Further she advises
             that in relation to the care proceedings that a parenting  and
             psychological assessment has been directed and that the  final
             decision in relation to the  care  proceedings  would  not  be
             before the end of February 2016."

13. The judge accepted that the claimant's contact with K was "sporadic".

14. The judge went on  to  consider  Art  8  and  whether  there  were  any
    "compelling reasons" based, principally, upon the fact that there  were
    ongoing care proceedings involving the claimant in respect of  K.   The
    judge sought to apply the Upper Tribunal decision in MH (pending family
    proceedings - discretionary leave)  Morocco  [2010]  UKUT  00439  (IAC)
    which recognises that a short grant of discretionary leave in order  to
    permit a parent to take part  in  ongoing  family  proceedings  may  be
    appropriate under Art 8.  The judge dealt with this at paras  61-63  as
    follows:

         "61.     In MH the Upper Tribunal confirmed the  earlier  Court  of
             Appeal decision of MS (Ivory Coast) v Secretary of  State  for
             the Home Department [2007] EWCA  Civ  133  and  held  that  'a
             decision to remove an applicant in the process  of  seeking  a
             contact order may violate Article 8 ECHR, in particular on the
             basis that removal of a parent/applicant during contact  order
             proceedings would be unlawful because it prejudged the outcome
             of the contact proceedings and, more importantly,  denied  the
             applicant  all   possibility   of   any   further   meaningful
             involvement in the proceedings  which  may  breach  Article  6
             ECHR'.  I would accept that the Appellant should  be  afforded
             the opportunity to engage in the care proceedings.

         62.  Further in accordance with the dictum of MH  where  there  are
             ongoing family proceedings involving children,  an  immigrant,
             as in the Appellant in this appeal should be granted a  period
             of discretionary  leave.   Once  the  outcome  of  the  family
             proceedings is determined then the Appellant is able to  apply
             under the relevant provision of the Rules as a parent if  that
             application is justified on the basis of the  outcome  of  the
             family case.  I refer to guidance note 4 of the MH decision:-

             'Where such a case arises before the Tribunal it is usual  for
             the appeal to be allowed pursuant to Article  8  ECHR,  rather
             than for the proceedings to remain within the Tribunal  system
             to be adjourned, perhaps more than once.  The Respondent  will
             normally then grant a  short  period  of  discretionary  leave
             bearing in mind any relevant facts found by,  or  observations
             of an Immigration Judge.  It is for the Respondent  to  decide
             on the period of leave in each case'.

         63.   It  follows  from  the  above  having  considered   all   the
             circumstances  of  this   case   and   the   public   interest
             requirements of section 117B that the Appellant does  have  an
             Article 8 claim  outside  of  the  Rules.   Consequently,  the
             public interest in the Appellant's removal would not  outweigh
             the interference with his  private  and  family  life  in  the
             circumstances because of the pending care proceedings and such
             interference  would  not  be   proportionate.    However,   in
             accordance with the guidance in MH any grant of  discretionary
             leave should be limited to the period required to complete the
             care proceedings.  I have been advised by Ms Bayoumi that  the
             care proceedings are  due  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of
             February 2016.  This is confirmed in the previously  mentioned
             email 6 October 2015 (document A1).  In the  circumstances,  I
             allow this appeal pursuant to Article 8 however solely on  the
             basis of a recommendation of a grant  of  discretionary  leave
             until the care proceedings have been determined."

The Grounds of Appeal

15. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal are, in  essence,  that  the
    judge failed to apply the guidance in RS (Immigration and family  court
    proceedings) India  [2012]  UKUT  00218  (IAC).   At  [43],  the  Upper
    Tribunal set out a series of questions that a judge  should  take  into
    account in determining whether, in circumstances such as in this  case,
    a short grant of discretionary leave might be  justified  under  Art  8
    until the conclusion of family proceedings:

         "43.     In our judgment, when a judge sitting  in  an  immigration
             appeal has to consider whether a person with a criminal record
             or adverse immigration history should be removed  or  deported
             when there are family proceedings contemplated  by  the  judge
             should consider the following questions:

             (i)  Is the outcome of  the  contemplated  family  proceedings
                  likely to be material to the immigration decision?

             (ii)     Are  there  compelling  public  interest  reasons  to
                  exclude the claimant from the United Kingdom  irrespective
                  of the outcome of  the  family  proceedings  or  the  best
                  interests of the child?

             (iii)    In the case of contact proceedings  initiated  by  an
                  appellant in an immigration appeal, is there any reason to
                  believe that the family proceedings have  been  instituted
                  to delay or frustrate  removal  and  not  to  promote  the
                  child's welfare?

             (iv)     In assessing the  above  questions,  the  judge  will
                  normally want to consider: the degree  of  the  claimant's
                  previous interest in  and  contact  with  the  child,  the
                  timing of the contact proceedings and the commitment  with
                  which they have been progressed, when a decision is likely
                  to  be  reached,  what  materials  (if  any)  are  already
                  available or can be made available to identify pointers to
                  where the child's welfare lies?"

16. The Secretary of State argues in her grounds that the judge  failed  to
    follow the guidance in RS in particular failing to  consider:  "Whether
    or not the care proceedings had been instituted in order  to  frustrate
    or delay removal or, in any event, not to promote the child's welfare."

17. Further, the grounds argue that the claimant could  not  succeed  under
    the Rules and, having regard to the public interest considerations  set
    out in s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:

         "If  [the  appellant  does  not  have  a  genuine  and   subsisting
         relationship with his child] ..., it is submitted that ongoing care
         proceedings cannot on their own outweigh the public interest."

Discussion

18. In my judgment, the judge's decision does not  fail  properly  to  take
    into account the guidance in RS at [43] which was subsequently approved
    by the Court of Appeal in Mohan v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1363.

19. First, the outcome of the family proceedings was likely to be  material
    to the immigration decision as part of the claimant's  case  was  based
    upon a continuing relationship (at least through contact) with K.  This
    was the case even though the judge found, as a result  of  K  being  in
    foster care, that the claimant did not have a "genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship" with K.  Even if the appellant's "contact" could
    not be equated with such a relationship, continuing "contact" would  be
    relevant in assessing both the appellant's and K's Art 8 rights.

20. Secondly, there were no compelling public interest reasons  to  exclude
    the claimant from the United Kingdom irrespective of the outcome of the
    family proceedings or the child's best interests.  This was  a  removal
    case.  The claimant had been in the UK since 2011 when he was 15  years
    old and had been granted discretionary leave since his application  for
    asylum was refused on 12 October 2011.   There  was  no  suggestion  of
    criminality or other public  policy  reasons  (apart  from  immigration
    control) which were of a compelling nature such as  might  arise  in  a
    deportation case.

21. Thirdly, there was no reason to believe that the care  proceedings  had
    been instituted to delay or frustrate the claimant's removal or not  to
    promote K's welfare.  In the case of private family law proceedings, it
    will be the parties who initiate the proceedings.  In the public family
    law context of care proceedings, it will be the local  social  services
    department who initiate the proceedings.  In any event,  there  was  no
    evidence before the judge that the claimant had  instituted  or  become
    involved in the care proceedings in order to frustrate his  removal  or
    in an attempt to act contrary to K's interests.

22. Fourthly, the evidence before the judge was that the claimant  retained
    a close interest in the life of K.  He had the  benefit  of  supervised
    contact with  K  once  a  week.   Even  though  he  had  only  attended
    approximately half of the  sessions,  he  had  nevertheless  maintained
    contact and there is no reason to doubt that he hoped to retain contact
    with K (if he remained in the UK) after the care proceedings concluded.

23. The evidence before the judge was that the care proceedings were likely
    to conclude not before the end of February 2016.   The  hearing  before
    the  judge  was  in  October  2015  and  therefore  a  short  grant  of
    discretionary leave, perhaps of six months would suffice.

24. Consequently, I see nothing  inconsistent  with  the  judge's  decision
    contrary to a proper application of the guidance in [43] of  RS.   That
    disposes of the Secretary of State's first ground.

25. Turning to the second ground, by virtue of s.117B(1)  of  the  NIA  Act
    2002 the maintenance effect of immigration control was  in  the  public
    interest as the claimant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules.
     Nevertheless, as the case law of the Upper Tribunal (RS)  approved  by
    the Court of Appeal (Mohan) recognises,  the  public  interest  may  be
    outweighed by an individual's circumstances where he or she is  engaged
    in family proceedings concerning their child where  the  issue  of  the
    "best interests" of the child and continued contact with the individual
    are raised.  As I have  said,  there  was  nothing  in  the  claimant's
    background that was sufficiently compelling to exclude him from the  UK
    irrespective of consideration of K's best interests which were  at  the
    heart of  the  care  proceedings.   There  was  nothing  irrational  or
    otherwise unlawful in the judge's finding in para 63  that  the  public
    interest was outweighed by the claimant's circumstances to  the  extent
    of justifying a grant of discretionary leave for a short  period  until
    the care proceedings were determined.

26. For those reasons, the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  err  in  law  in
    allowing the claimant's appeal under Art 8 on this basis.

27. Following a short adjournment at  the  conclusion  of  submissions,  Mr
    James,  having  sought  instructions,  informed  me   that   the   care
    proceedings had now  been  completed  and  the  outcome  was  that  the
    claimant would not be able to see K until he reached  the  age  of  18.
    That, of course, is not  relevant  to  the  challenge  to  the  judge's
    decision which was simply that leave should be granted until  the  care
    proceedings were concluded.  Its relevance lies,  if  at  all,  in  the
    Secretary of State's response now to the First-tier Tribunal's decision
    in the light of it being upheld by the Upper Tribunal.

Decision

28. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow the appeal under Art  8  on
    the limited basis I have indicated, did not involve the  making  of  an
    error of law.  The decision stands.

29.  Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.


                                                                      Signed
