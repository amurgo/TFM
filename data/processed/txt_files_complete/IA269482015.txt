For the Appellant:     Ms N Nelson-Cofie, instructed by Calices Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Coates promulgated 6.1.16,  dismissing  the  appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State,  dated  14.7.15,
    to refuse his application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  on
    the basis of private and family life.  The Judge heard  the  appeal  on
    16.2.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Keane granted permission to appeal on 7.6.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 19.7.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. After hearing submissions on error of  law,  I  reserved  my  decision,
    which I now give.

 5. For the reasons briefly set out below, I find no material error of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to
    require the decision of Judge Coates to be set aside.

 6. The grounds contend that the judge erred by having regard under section
    55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009,  of  the  best
    interests of the appellant's child living in Jamaica, when  section  55
    is limited to children who are in the UK and does not apply to children
    overseas. The judge did not assess the best interests of that child but
    stated at �21, "...it would be in his (the appellant's) best  interests
    if the appellant were to return to Jamaica  to  live  with  and  resume
    responsibility for his child."

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Keane found  it  arguable  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge made an error of law in not applying  the
    relevant statutory provisions and in embarking on  a  consideration  of
    the best interests of the child in Jamaica, a child who at all material
    times resided overseas. "The judge made an arguable material  error  of
    law but for which the outcome of the appeal might have been  different.
    The application for permission is granted."

 8. One of the difficulties for  the  appellant  pursuing  this  ground  of
    appeal is that at �17 of the decision the judge noted that  section  55
    'technically' only applies to children in  the  UK,  "it  is  generally
    accepted that the principle should be applied to all children  who  are
    likely to be affected by the decision under appeal. Counsel agreed with
    me in submissions that this principle would  include  consideration  of
    (the child's) best interest."

 9. In effect, the appellant  is  complaining  that  the  judge  took  into
    account the best interests of  one  of  his  biological  children  when
    considering the best interests of another. Apart from the fact that the
    argument is unattractive, on the facts of this case I am not  satisfied
    that there is  any  error  of  law  in  this  regard,  the  appellant's
    representative agreeing that the judge should have regard for the  best
    interests of that other child. No complaint  is  made  that  the  judge
    omitted to have  regard  to  the  best  interests  of  the  appellant's
    biological child in the UK.

10. Reliance was placed by Ms Nelson-Cofie on T  (s55  BCIA  2009  -  entry
    clearance) Jamaica [2011] UKUT 00483 (IAC), where it was held that  the
    statutory guidance of section 55 does not apply  to  children  who  are
    outside the UK. However, in that case the child was in Jamaica  seeking
    to join her parent in the UK. Whilst it  was  accepted  that  the  duty
    under section 55 did not apply, reference was made to the Secretary  of
    State's guidance that overseas UKBA staff "must adhere to the spirit of
    the duty and make enquiries when they have reason  to  suspect  that  a
    child may be in need of protection or safeguarding or  present  welfare
    that requires attention."  ZH  (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC  4,  and  other
    similar case law, places emphasis on  the  welfare  of  children  as  a
    primary consideration in all  immigration  decision-making.  In  T  the
    Upper Tribunal rejected the suggestion that  there  was  a  "spirit  of
    section 55" general duty under common law,  it  being  too  vague,  but
    agreed that there was a duty to have regard to the best interests of  T
    as a primary consideration. The case is certainly not authority for the
    proposition that to have regard for the welfare or best interests of  a
    child who is outside the UK amounts to an error of law.

11. In the circumstances, I find no error of law in the judge having regard
    in general terms to the best interests  of  the  appellant's  child  in
    Jamaica.

12. Another difficulty for the appellant is that it was  also  conceded  by
    appellant's representative  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for leave to remain on the  basis
    of private and family life, as  noted  by  the  judge  at  �19  of  the
    decision. His representative solely addressed  article  8  outside  the
    Rules, without any apparent consideration as to whether there  was  any
    justification for doing so.

13. It is clear that at �21 the judge found no  exceptional  or  compelling
    circumstances to justify a separate consideration of article 8  outside
    the Rules.  It follows that the appeal would have to be dismissed.  Any
    consideration in the decision of article 8 ECHR could  only  have  been
    entirely in the alternative. The grounds of appeal  make  no  complaint
    about and do not address this finding. No permission to appeal has been
    sought or given in respect of the judge's finding that there  there  is
    no basis for considering article 8 ECHR outside the Rules and  so  that
    part of the decision must stand as made.

14. It further follows from the above that any comments about  taking  into
    account the best  interests  of  the  child  in  Jamaica  or  the  best
    interests of the appellant in returning to look after that  child  were
    not in fact material to the decision in the appeal. Inclusion  of  such
    considerations, whilst not within the scope of the statutory  provision
    under section 55, do not bear on the finding that the appellant did not
    meet the requirements of the Rules and that there were  no  exceptional
    or compelling circumstances to justify consideration of  family  and/or
    private outside the Rules pursuant to article 8 ECHR.

15. In the circumstances, there is no merit in the sole  ground  of  appeal
    and the appeal must fail.

Conclusions:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
