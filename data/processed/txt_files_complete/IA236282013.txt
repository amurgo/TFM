                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge David Bartlett), sitting at Taylor House, he says on 29
    October 2012 and 13 January 2013, but  clearly  meaning  the  following
    year in each case, to  an EEA appeal by a citizen of Pakistan, born  12
    April 1984, and married to a citizen of Slovakia. The grounds on  which
    permission was given mainly relate  to  what  are  said  to  have  been
    irrational findings of fact on the part of the judge; but also  to  the
    circumstances in which he adjourned  the  appeal  part-heard,  for  the
    sponsor to come back from Slovakia to give oral evidence.

 2. The judge's approach to the credibility points raised was, as  he  said
    at several points in the course of his decision, to accept the evidence
    of the appellant and sponsor as "... given in a plausible and  credible
    manner - on a balance of probabilities", and the  documentary  evidence
    produced (though for the most part only at the second hearing), and  so
    to dispose of the Home Office challenges.

 3. While there was nothing wrong in the judge's relying to  an  extent  on
    his personal impression of the evidence given, as would a jury,  unlike
    a jury any professional judge has to give rational explanations for his
    findings of fact, especially for those made against the  losing  party.
    This particularly applies to findings made (or not, as the case may be)
    on credibility points raised by that party.

 4. The judge carefully listed the credibility  points  taken  against  the
    appellant's  credibility,  together  with  the   sponsor's,   following
    separate interviews, at paragraphs 6 - 11: obviously he considered them
    significant enough for that to be worth doing.  Perhaps he didn't  have
    to deal with every single point in detail: what he needed to deal  with
    was the substance of the Home Office case against the appellant, and it
    is worth going through them in order to see whether or not he  achieved
    that. I have given each of them a letter for ease of reference.

 5. The background to the interviews was that the appellant had been  given
    an EEA residence card on 25 August 2011, as the sponsor's husband; they
    had been married here on 21 December 2010. When he returned, after what
    he says was a short absence in Pakistan, on 18 June 2013, he was  given
    temporary admission only, as it turned out the sponsor was not in  this
    country, but back home in Slovakia. The immigration  officer  spoke  to
    her there on  the  number  he  was  given,  but  with  some  difficulty
    communicating with her in English.

 6. The immigration officer  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  was
    joining  the  sponsor  here;  but  gave  him  three  weeks'   temporary
    admission, so she could return and be interviewed.  The  appellant  was
    fully interviewed on 9 July, following a telephone interview  with  the
    sponsor on the 7th, at which it was again noted that  her  English  was
    rather deficient: the appellant speaks no Slovak. There  was  still  no
    indication as to when the sponsor would be back in this country, and so
    on 18 July the appellant's residence card was  cancelled,  and  he  was
    refused leave to enter.

 7. These are the credibility points taken against the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor: : his own lack of knowledge at interview can be taken  as  the
    subject of each, unless the contrary appears

     a) the name of the place where they were married
        At paragraph 15 the judge records the appellant as saying he simply
        couldn't remember this, over two years after the event.

     b) when the sponsor was expecting their child
        The appellant said November; she said December. Her explanation was
        that her due date  had  been  the  cusp  of  the  month;  but  (see
        paragraph 36) "her pregnancy had to be terminated at mid-stage  due
        to complications with her health". The appellant  had  said  on  29
        October that the sponsor was still expecting;  but  (paragraph  14)
        she had kept her exact due date from  him  as  a  surprise.  On  13
        January  (paragraph  28)  he     described  her  as  having  had  a
        miscarriage, on 25 July in Slovakia; when challenged about what  he
        had said the previous time, he said he hadn't known about  it  till
        the sponsor got back from there on 5 November. No medical  evidence
        has been produced, though the appellant said on 29 October (see 14)
        that the sponsor would be able to do this on her return.

     c) the name of the sponsor's daughter by a previous marriage
        The appellant  wasn't  cross-examined  about  this:  the  sponsor's
        daughter had been with her in Slovakia all the time  she  was  back
        there last year, but the immigration officer's  notice  of  refusal
        suggests that the appellant had  described  himself  as  her  step-
        father, having spent some time with both her  and  the  sponsor  in
        this country before.

     d) the name of the sponsor's mother, who he said he had met
        Again there is no explanation for this, though the appellant wasn't
        cross-examined about it.

     e) where the sponsor worked, apart from being a self-employed  cleaner
        in Bradford
        There may be nothing unreasonable in this, given the nature of  the
        sponsor's employment.

     f) the sponsor not knowing where the appellant worked
        He said at the (Leeds/Bradford) airport, she at a business park  in
        Sharston: the judge was apparently content to accept that  the  two
        places weren't far apart.

     g) the sponsor not being able to give  the  address  where  they  both
        lived
        The appellant suggested  that  perhaps  she  hadn't  been  able  to
        understand the interviewer on  this:  at  paragraph  53  the  judge
        refers to pay slips and a P60 produced by the sponsor on 13 January
        showing her address as the one for which the appellant had produced
        a tenancy agreement, though he had been unable to produce one on 29
        October, and the one produced later showed (see paragraph 31)  that
        it had been generated in 2013.

 8. I shall return to the documentary evidence in due course; but the other
    point on which the judge's decision is challenged was on  what  he  did
    over the adjournment. First it is said he should not have granted it at
    all, or not on the state of the evidence before him. The appellant  was
    certainly extremely lucky to get an adjournment on 29 October, when  he
    must have realized, ever since the decision under appeal  on  18  July,
    and even without legal advice, that the sponsor would be  an  essential
    witness for him. However, on the information put before the judge, that
    decision was well within his discretion.

 9. A more interesting point on this aspect of the case concerns the  state
    of the appellant's knowledge of his wife's condition on 29 October. His
    evidence at that time (see the judge's paragraph 14) was that  she  was
    pregnant (and her mother sick) and he didn't know  when  she  would  be
    back in  this  country.  As  it  turned  out,  however,  the  sponsor's
    pregnancy was said to have come  to  an  end  on  25  July:  while  the
    appellant said he didn't know about  that  till  she  came  back  on  5
    November, he cannot have made any serious inquiries  about  her  health
    and ability to return before the hearing on 29 October, or no doubt she
    would have told him what had happened.

10. Finally there is the way in which the judge dealt with the evidence  at
    the adjourned hearing. While the Home Office grounds of appeal  suggest
    that he should have warned the appellant not to talk about his evidence
    to the sponsor during the adjournment, Mr Mills realistically  accepted
    that such a warning, as between  husband  and  wife,  would  have  been
    pointless at best: a much better idea would have been for the judge  to
    warn himself that they had by then had plenty of opportunity  to  match
    each other's evidence, if that was what they wanted to do. In  my  view
    this warning was desirable in general, and essential on points, such as
    those set out by the judge at paragraph 55, where  he  found  they  had
    specifically corroborated each other.

CONCLUSIONS

11. As will already be clear, there were two substantial parts of the  Home
    Office case against the appellant, both of which the  judge  needed  to
    deal with. First  there  were  the  credibility  points  taken  by  the
    immigration officer, faced as he was between 18 June and 18  July  with
    an absent Slovak wife with poor  English,  and  a  non-Slovak  speaking
    husband who couldn't say when she would be back in this  country.  Then
    there were the points which  came  out  only  on  the  second  hearing,
    particularly as to the appellant's state of knowledge about his  wife's
    pregnancy. These might have been considered capable of raising a  doubt
    as to when, if ever, she might have returned to this country, if it had
    not been for the (no doubt unexpected) invitation  from  the  judge  to
    come back and give evidence at an adjourned hearing.

12. Looking first at the immigration  officer's  points  one  by  one,  and
    risking the accusation of perpetuating sex stereotypes, there  may  not
    have been anything so odd in a man not remembering his  wedding  venue,
    especially in a foreign country 2� years later;  or  the  name  of  his
    mother-in-law, or the sponsor's daughter (though, if so, it was  rather
    odd that he should have specifically described her to  the  immigration
    officer as his step-daughter. So much for points (a), (c) and  (d):  as
    for (e) and (f), about their  less  than  complete  knowledge  of  each
    other's work-places, it would be wrong to judge this  from  the  stand-
    point of anyone lucky enough to have a more interesting job than either
    the appellant or the sponsor are likely to.

13. That leaves the points  which  are  really  significant,  because  they
    directly concern the appellant  and  the  sponsor's  married  life  and
    living together. On (b), taken together  with  what  came  out  at  the
    adjourned hearing (see 9), the  appellant's  evidence  on  29  October,
    which on 13 January he seemed at first to have  forgotten  giving,  was
    that the sponsor was still pregnant, and he didn't know when she  would
    be back here. In my view the evidence which he then gave on 13 January,
    to the effect that she had come back on 5 November and only  then  told
    him about her pregnancy's termination in July, was something  which  at
    least required  some  discussion;  but  it  got  none  in  the  judge's
    decision.

14. On (g), the crucial document  was  the  tenancy  agreement,  which  the
    appellant had been unable to produce on  29  October.  While  a  simple
    failure of that kind, by an unrepresented party, to produce a  document
    even so important as that, might have been overlooked, once it had been
    put right after the adjournment, the way in which  that  was  attempted
    was of much more interest. A tenancy agreement was produced, apparently
    for accommodation the appellant and the sponsor had  occupied  together
    since 2011 - 12; but it came on a form generated  in  2013.  The  judge
    recorded the appellant's explanation that this was  what  his  landlord
    had provided him with, after the first hearing. However this too in  my
    view required critical exploration, as to how a  landlord  should  have
    come to have no copy of the original agreement, but  been  prepared  to
    generate a fresh one when it was wanted.

15. The importance of that last deficiency is that  the  tenancy  agreement
    was not only important in itself, but  provided  the  reference  point,
    with which the  judge  noted  (see  paragraph  53)  all  the  sponsor's
    documents agreed, so far as her address was concerned. These were  also
    produced for the first time at the adjourned hearing: in my  view  this
    raises a significant point about the authenticity  of  the  documentary
    evidence, which might possibly otherwise  have  justified  the  judge's
    overlooking what might politely be described as a degree  of  vagueness
    on the appellant's part about when his wife was likely to be back,  and
    whether or not she was expecting.

16. The result is that the judge's credibility  findings,  though  set  out
    with great care, did not  satisfactorily  deal  with  important  issues
    before him, and his decision  will  have  to  be  made  again.  I  have
    considered retaining it before myself in the Upper Tribunal for that to
    be done; but I am all too conscious that, inevitably, I have had to say
    a good deal about the facts already. While I have certainly not made up
    my mind about them, and have  of  course  not  heard  from  either  the
    appellant or the sponsor myself,  that  might  not  be  the  impression
    given; and I think it would be much better for this appeal to  go  back
    to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing  before  another  judge,
    who will be entirely free to make up their own mind about it.  In  view
    of Judge Bartlett's very considerable experience, that should be a full-
    time judge of some seniority.
