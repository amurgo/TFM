Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Rahman, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity direction.

 2. The appellant is a Bangladeshi national.   The  appellant  applied  for
    indefinite leave to remain as the  spouse  of  a  British  national  on
    September 1, 2015. His application was refused  by  the  respondent  on
    March 2, 2016. His appeal came before Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Adio (hereinafter called "the Judge")  on  March  20,  2017  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on March 30, 2017 the Judge allowed the appeal  on
    the basis he satisfied Section EX.1 of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
    Rules. The Judge  concluded  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life existing anywhere other  than  the  United  Kingdom  having
    regard to the relationship that existed between  the  appellant's  wife
    and her parents and in particular her mother.

 3. The respondent appealed that decision  and  permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Brunnen on October 9, 2017.
    The matter came  before  me  on  January  3,  2018  and  after  hearing
    representations from both parties I found there was an error in law  on
    the basis the Judge's finding were made  without  any  current  medical
    evidence and I adjourned the matter for further evidence.

 4. A further bundle was served late by the appellant's solicitors on March
    15,  2018  and  contained  within  that  bundle  was  medical  evidence
    appertaining to the appellant's father-in-law's  health-something  that
    had not specifically been argued before the FTT Judge.

 5. Mr Melvin had provided written submissions that did not take  this  new
    evidence into account. He indicated that in light of the content of the
    bundle and the fact the appellant's wife was again absent he  would  be
    challenging both the  medical  evidence  and  the  subsistence  of  the
    relationship. The latter point was being taken because there was a lack
    of evidence the relationship was subsisting despite this not  being  an
    issue either in the most recent  decision  letter  or  before  the  FTT
    Judge.

 6. The appellant's wife  had  not  attended  the  hearing  and  Mr  Rahman
    indicated the reason for this was she was at home caring for her father
    who was 80 years old and in poor health.

 7. The issue of an adjournment was discussed but after putting the  matter
    back twice for Mr Rahman to take instructions the  appellant  indicated
    he wanted his appeal to proceed today.

 8.  Thereafter,  I  took  oral  evidence  from  the  appellant  and  heard
    submissions from both representatives. I reserved my decision.

    APPELLANT'S CLAIM

 9. The appellant adopted his statement dated March 14, 2018 and gave  oral
    evidence. He stated he and  his  wife  had  married  in  Bangladesh  on
    November 27, 2006 and on May 5, 2011 he entered on a spouse visa.

10. In September 2015 the appellant lodged an  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain based on  his  marriage.  He  no  longer  pursued  this
    application but instead invited the Tribunal to allow his appeal  under
    article 8 ECHR on the basis (a) he satisfied Section EX.1  of  Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules or (b) there were compelling  circumstances
    that made removal disproportionate.

11. The appellant himself had suffered medical problems from  2010  and  in
    April 2012, having been diagnosed with excessive fluid on the brain and
    with a large tumour at the base of  his  skull.  Both  conditions  were
    successfully treated but he did lose the hearing in his right  ear.  He
    has to have regular check-ups on his brain and on the functions of  his
    glands.

12. He agreed he had previously relied on his mother-in-law's ill health as
    she had been suffering from cancer. Subsequent to that hearing she died
    in August 2017. Although his  father-in-law  had  health  problems,  as
    described in paragraph 5 of his  statement,  they  had  only  become  a
    problem since the death of the appellant's mother-in-law.

13. His father-in-law requires around the clock care and both  he  and  his
    wife care for him. The appellant looks after his father-in-law  on  his
    own when his wife is at work.

14. Medical evidence confirmed his father-in-law suffered from a  condition
    that slowed his heart rate to such a level that it does not pump enough
    oxygen  around  his  body  thereby  placing  him  at  risk  of   losing
    consciousness. There have been three incidents when he blacked out  and
    on two occasions he was taken to hospital.

15. The appellant will often sleep in a single bed in  his  father-in-law's
    bedroom and takes him to the bathroom at night and assists him going to
    and from the toilet. In the morning the appellant  washes  and  dresses
    him as well as cooking breakfast for him. The appellant's father-in-law
    can walk short distances with the aid of a walking  stick  and  so  the
    appellant will take him out. The appellant and his  wife  jointly  care
    for her father in the evenings.

16. The appellant's father-in-law will not deal with  carers  and  although
    the appellant's wife has siblings they have not played any role in  his
    day-to-day care.

17.  The  appellant's  father-in-law's  English  is  non-existent.  If  the
    appellant had to leave the United Kingdom this would have a  disastrous
    effect upon both the appellant's wife and her father.

18. The appellant would be unable to provide the  physical,  emotional  and
    mental support that he  has  been  providing  his  father-in-law  since
    August 2017 and the effect upon his wife will also be significant.

19. In oral evidence he confirmed that his wife was unable to attend either
    the original hearing or the current hearing due to the  fact  that  she
    was providing care for her parents. The appellant's  father-in-law  was
    unfit to attend court and was being  looked  after  by  his  wife.  The
    appellant's father-in-law has an appointment to attend at the  hospital
    later this month when he will be assessed for a pacemaker.

20. During cross examination he confirmed that both he and  his  wife  were
    first cousins and he accepted that the previous Judge in 2015  rejected
    his claim to be in a  subsisting  relationship  or  to  be  a  credible
    witness. He confirmed that due to his mother and  father-in-law's  ill-
    health they had not had much of a social life.  He  had  not  discussed
    this issue at the previous hearing because there was  no  need  and  he
    reiterated his father-in-law's health had worsened over the last 6 to 8
    months.

21. The appellant accepted there was no medical  evidence  that  showed  he
    suffered from dementia but his wife knew more about his condition.

22. He explained that his brothers and sisters-in-laws were busy with their
    own lives and had not taken on the  responsibility  for  looking  after
    their father. He was aware there had been some discussion about a carer
    coming in but he believed his father needed 24 hour care and  this  was
    not available and in any event he would not have anyone else.

    OTHER EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT

23. The appellant's wife, whilst not  attending  the  hearing,  provided  a
    witness statement dated March 14, 2018. She confirmed that since August
    2017 she has had to give up her employment in a restaurant and now only
    works part-time in a grocery store earning �7500 gross.  Her  hours  of
    work are between 9 AM and 2 PM five  days  a  week.  In  addition,  she
    receives a carer's allowance for looking after her father although this
    payment will be reviewed when a decision  is  taken  over  whether  her
    father will have to have a pacemaker.

24. Her father receives a state pension and  disability  living  allowance.
    She confirms that her father will not deal with strangers and  believes
    that the hospital, doctors and nurses killed his wife. Her husband  had
    the ability to bring her father out of his shell and  interacts  freely
    with him. Her father is very close to the appellant to the extent  that
    her husband helps him use the  toilet  and  wash  as  him  as  well  as
    providing his daily meals.

25. The appellant's wife reiterated that  whilst  she  has  three  siblings
    living in this country they each have their own families and  they  had
    distanced themselves from their parents ever since  their  mother,  who
    has since died, needed more help. It is her  recollection,  the  family
    stopped helping in 2015 and would only visit every couple of months and
    there were limited phone calls from them.

26. Whilst acknowledging a private carer could be  employed  she  does  not
    believe such a solution would be effective in this case. The amount  of
    care on offer would be  insufficient  because  her  father's  condition
    required constant monitoring. Her husband was on hand all day and  this
    was a better solution.

27. Medical evidence confirmed the  appellant's  own  medical  history  and
    there was also medical evidence from February 2018 which  outlined  her
    father's medical condition, how it  was  currently  being  managed  and
    there was also a report detailing an assessment that had  been  carried
    out  on  him.  This  report  was  based  on  a  conversation  with  the
    appellant's  wife  who  provided  details  to  them  of   his   current
    circumstances.

    SUBMISSIONS

28. Mr Melvin invited the Tribunal to find that there was  no  evidence  of
    any subsisting relationship between the appellant  and  his  wife.  The
    only evidence of that relationship was in the  form  of  oral  evidence
    from the appellant himself. The appellant's wife had failed  to  attend
    the  hearing  and  there  was  no   documentary   evidence   of   their
    relationship. The appellant's wife had been given  the  opportunity  to
    attend today's hearing or alternatively to attend on a  different  date
    when this appeal could  be  heard.  Both  options  had  been  declined.
    Previously the appellant had relied on his mother-in-law's illness  and
    had not previously raised his  father-in-law's  illness.  That  medical
    evidence submitted was insufficient to support  the  appellant's  claim
    that he should be allowed to remain in this country. Whilst he accepted
    the appellant had medical problems and was now 80 years  of  age  there
    was no independent evidence from social services  or  from  within  the
    community to suggest support would not be available in  the  event  the
    appellant was required to leave. Mr Melvin submitted that the appellant
    was exaggerating his father-in-law's health problems in his attempt  to
    remain in the United Kingdom. The referral document  contained  in  the
    bundle was  not  a  formal  medical  assessment  but  was  based  on  a
    conversation with the appellant's wife. No weight should be attached to
    this report. Mr Melvin invited me to find there were no  insurmountable
    obstacles and there were no exceptional circumstances why  this  appeal
    should be allowed under article 8 ECHR.

29. Mr Rahman challenged the respondent's claim that there was no  evidence
    that the marriage was subsisting. Whilst  noting  a  previous  Tribunal
    (not the Tribunal which heard this matter on  the  last  occasion)  had
    found there was no subsisting relationship it  was  important  to  note
    firstly this was not an issue raised by  the  respondent  in  the  last
    refusal  letter  and  secondly  the  Judge  was  satisfied  that  their
    relationship was genuine and subsisting. Mr Melvin had raised the issue
    of subsisting relationship only at today's hearing and he invited me to
    find that there was a genuine and subsisting relationship  between  the
    appellant and his wife and following the decision letter the only issue
    preventing the appellant succeeding under  the  Immigration  Rules  was
    whether there were insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing
    outside of the United Kingdom. Mr Rahman  submitted  that  the  medical
    evidence did support what was being argued and that the reason  it  had
    not previously been raised was simply because it had not been an  issue
    before the original Tribunal. The appellant's father-in-law's condition
    had worsened since that last hearing and since his  wife's  death.  The
    Tribunal should note what the medical evidence says about his condition
    and the fact that there was a lack of support from within  the  family.
    He argued that the Tribunal  could  attach  weight  to  the  assessment
    report  because  whilst  the  information  may  have  come   from   the
    appellant's wife the referral itself had  come  from  the  council.  He
    submitted that there were  insurmountable  obstacles  or  alternatively
    there were  exceptional  circumstances  that  merited  the  appellant's
    appeal being allowed outside of the Immigration Rules.

    FINDINGS

30. The appellant had made an application for indefinite  leave  to  remain
    and in  dismissing  that  appeal  the  FTT  Judge  concluded  that  the
    appellant could not demonstrate compliance with the Immigration  Rules.
    This finding has not been challenged and today's appeal is  brought  on
    the basis that the appellant satisfied the  Immigration  Rules  and  in
    particular Section EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Alternatively, the appeal is brought on private and family life grounds
    under article 8 ECHR.

31. Mr Melvin at the commencement of today's hearing  raised  a  new  issue
    namely  the  subsistence  of  the  appellant's  marriage.   In   cross-
    examination he referred the appellant to previous and  pointed  out  to
    the  appellant  that  that  earlier  Tribunal  had  not   found   their
    relationship to be subsisting.

32. I did not find this line of cross-examination to  be  helpful  at  all.
    Neither the refusal letter nor his colleague in the First-tier Tribunal
    felt this issue was a relevant matter to be pursued. When  this  matter
    appeared before me  in  January  2018  there  was  no  indication  that
    subsistence of the marriage would be a live issue. I indicated  to  the
    parties during that earlier hearing that there was an error of law  and
    that I would be dealing with an article 8 assessment  both  within  and
    outside the Immigration Rules. If subsistence of  the  marriage  was  a
    live issue then it was incumbent upon  the  respondent  to  raise  that
    issue so the appellant and his wife could address it. Whilst I did  not
    prevent that line of questioning been put I was satisfied on  the  oral
    evidence given by the appellant that he was in a genuine and subsisting
    relationship with his wife.

33. The second issue that was raised by Mr Melvin centred around  the  fact
    that the appellant's father-in-law's ill health had hitherto  not  been
    raised. I will assess the evidence of ill health in due course  but  on
    the face of it I accept that at the FTT hearing the father-in-law's ill
    health was not an issue but it became an issue  more  recently.  It  is
    perhaps something which should have been raised at  the  conclusion  of
    the hearing in January 2018 but I note the medical evidence  post-dates
    that hearing date.

34. The appellant has argued that there are insurmountable obstacles to him
    enjoying family life outside of the United  Kingdom.  Section  EX.2  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules defines "insurmountable obstacles"
    and both the Court of Appeal and more recently  the  Supreme  Court  in
    Agyarko v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 identified the high test that had  to  be
    met. The test  is  a  "significantly  more  demanding  test"  than  the
    reasonableness test applied in article 8 ECHR appeals.

35. The Supreme Court reminds us that the test  is  a  stringent  test  and
    requiring the appellant and spouse to settle in the appellant's country
    of origin, whilst creating a degree of  hardship,  did  not  amount  to
    insurmountable obstacles. At [45] of the  Supreme  Court  decision  the
    Court stated-

         "By virtue of paragraph  EX.1(b),  "insurmountable  obstacles"  are
         treated as a requirement for the grant of leave under the Rules  in
         cases to which that paragraph  applies.  Accordingly,  interpreting
         the expression in the same sense as in  the  Strasbourg  case  law,
         leave to remain would not normally be granted  in  cases  where  an
         applicant for leave to remain under the partner route was in the UK
         in breach of  immigration  laws,  unless  the  applicant  or  their
         partner would face very serious difficulties  in  continuing  their
         family life together outside the UK, which could not be overcome or
         would entail very serious hardship.  Even  in  a  case  where  such
         difficulties  do  not  exist,  however,   leave   to   remain   can
         nevertheless  be  granted  outside  the   Rules   in   "exceptional
         circumstances", in accordance with the  Instructions:  that  is  to
         say,  in  "circumstances  in  which   refusal   would   result   in
         unjustifiably harsh  consequences  for  the  individual  such  that
         refusal of the application would not be proportionate".

36. I previously found there had been an error in law in the way the  Judge
    had dealt with the assessment of the medical evidence.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal had been considering the mother-in-law's medical condition and
    the only evidence before the court on that occasion was  that  she  had
    been given the all clear for the cancer she had been treated  for.  She
    had attended at hospital for an MRI scan  but  this  had  not  revealed
    anything untoward. The medical evidence provided  in  relation  to  the
    appellant revealed he was not seeing a consultant but had been  advised
    to have another scan in or  around  August  2017.  No  further  medical
    evidence for either the appellant or his mother-in-law (or his  father-
    in-law for that matter) had been adduced and no evidence of whether the
    appellant could receive any ongoing  treatment  for  his  condition  in
    Bangladesh had been adduced to the Judge.

37. On the issue of medical care the situation I am  faced  with  today  is
    potentially different from that faced by the First-tier Judge.  I  have
    been provided with recent medical evidence and I have  considered  that
    evidence and whether that evidence alters the position.

38. The report provided by the hospital is a medical discharge summary  and
    is dated February 15, 2018. It seems that the appellant's father-in-law
    was both admitted and discharged on an emergency basis  that  day.  The
    document  listed  those  matters  that  were  being  investigated   and
    diagnosed and reported that the appellant's father-in-law had collapsed
    in a chair and was incontinent. The  father-in-law  recovered  but  was
    taken to hospital and denied having any further symptoms of chest pain,
    shortness of breath, leg swelling or  pain  or  symptoms  of  infection
    recently.

39. The report recorded that  he  was  currently  under  the  care  of  the
    cardiology team and I have seen a follow-up letter  suggesting  further
    tests were being undertaken. The report identifies that  when  examined
    he was well and that he lived with family who were "always  around".  A
    consultant deemed him suitable for discharge.

40. There is a further report that predated his  emergency  admission  into
    hospital and is dated February 9, 2018. The report identified  previous
    surgery from 2007 and referred to the fact that at the end of  November
    2017  he  had  what  was  described  as  an  "unheralded   episode   of
    unresponsiveness whilst seated". A sinus bradycardia was identified but
    no  other  significant  bradyarrhythmia  was  identified  and  he   was
    discharged with an outpatient echo and 24-hour ECG and ongoing  follow-
    up. His sinus bradycardia was almost certainly exacerbated by the  fact
    he had been on amiodarone since 2007 and in the opinion  of  Dr  Evans,
    consultant, there was no reason for him to  continue  this  medication.
    She therefore arranged for a 24-hour ECG to be  carried  out  once  the
    medication was out of his system and the appointment was booked for the
    end of March 2018. Her conclusion was that the  November  2017  episode
    was likely to have been related to a sinus node disease  and  cessation
    of the aforementioned medication may result in  enough  improvement  to
    avoid a pacemaker.

41. The medical condition  of  the  appellant's  father-in-law  was  in  my
    opinion exaggerated by the appellant  both  in  his  written  and  oral
    evidence. The medical evidence adduced does not support the  conditions
    and complaints argued by Mr Rahman.

42. I had offered Mr Rahman the opportunity of  putting  this  appeal  back
    until May 2018 which would have enabled not only the  appellant's  wife
    to have reviewed her decision not to attend the hearing  but  also  the
    medical appointment at the end of March to have been attended  and  the
    outcome known. Mr Rahman made it clear that he did not wish to  adjourn
    the hearing and so I had to consider  the  appellant's  appeal  on  the
    evidence currently before me.

43. Contained within the appellant's bundle is an adult referral form.  The
    letter dated January 29, 2018 refers to the referral having  come  from
    Circle Housing Merton Priory Homes on September 4, 2017. However, it is
    clear from the form  contained  in  the  appellant's  bundle  that  the
    information for the report appears to have come  from  the  appellant's
    wife. There is a reference to dementia but  as  previously  stated  the
    medical evidence provides no comments or observations on  this.  Merely
    being asthmatic and suffering from diabetes would not  suggest  24-hour
    care is needed. The report refers to the level of  support  needed  but
    this report appears to be based on information provided solely  by  the
    appellant's wife and is  not  based  on  any  assessment  carried  out.
    Importantly the report refers to the fact  that  there  has  to  be  an
    assessment process and clearly this has not taken place. The claim  the
    appellant's father-in-law will not take  help  from  third  parties  is
    again not based on any independent assessment. There was nothing in the
    consultant's letters that suggested  the  father-in-law  was  rejecting
    assistance. He appears to have  cooperated  with  the  consultant  when
    spoken to.

44. There is no doubt that at 80 years of age the appellant's father-in-law
    is not as fit as he would like to be. He does have ongoing problems but
    the  extent  of  those  problems  remains  largely  undocumented.   The
    appellant relies on an emergency discharge summary and brief letter  of
    referral as his supporting evidence. I am not  satisfied  this  medical
    evidence meets the high test that needs needed to be satisfied.

45. The fact the appellant's wife was  British  and  worked  would  not  in
    itself amount to insurmountable obstacles.

46.  Medical  conditions  could  support  an  argument  of   insurmountable
    obstacles but such evidence would have to be  considered  on  both  its
    merits and content. I have considered the current medical evidence  and
    I am not satisfied his  condition  is  as  dire  as  portrayed  by  the
    appellant in his oral evidence and his wife in her statement.

47. There was no evidence from family  members  that  they  are  unable  to
    provide support. The appellant's father-in-law has four children living
    in the United Kingdom and they all appear to live  local  to  him.  The
    only evidence that they are unwilling to assist came from the appellant
    and his wife's evidence.

48. The appellant did not say that his wife's siblings were not on speaking
    terms with them.  It had been open to the appellant to  obtain  further
    evidence on this  issue.  Such  evidence  could  of  course  have  been
    obtained if the option of adjourning the case had been taken up.

49. With regard to the provision of care generally the evidence of  outside
    assistance was simply not contained in the bundle.  The  evidence  that
    was adduced was based purely on a  conversation  with  the  appellant's
    wife. No assessment had been carried out. Care within the community  is
    available to varying degrees-that is the point of a full assessment.

50. Having considered the evidence advanced I am not satisfied  that  there
    would be insurmountable obstacles to family  life  taking  place  other
    than in United Kingdom. If the appellant wishes to argue  that  he  and
    his wife have to remain in the United Kingdom because his wife's father
    wholly relies on them then more evidence should have been submitted.  I
    had adjourned the substantive hearing in January for such  evidence  to
    be adduced and I made it clear in my earlier decision that the evidence
    that was already before the Tribunal was insufficient. I therefore find
    the appellant has not satisfied the Immigration Rules.

51. I have gone on to separately consider the appeal under article 8  ECHR.
    I accept the appellant has a family life in the United Kingdom with his
    wife and the support he gives his father-in-law could amount to private
    life. The appellant did not meet the Immigration Rules and it therefore
    follows that the decision taken was lawful  and  for  the  purposes  of
    immigration control.

52. The real issue in this appeal is whether it would  be  disproportionate
    to require the appellant to leave the United Kingdom  to  continue  the
    family and private life that he has.

53. Mr Rahman referred me to the decision  of  R  (on  the  application  of
    Sison) v SSHD IJR [2016] UKUT 00033 (IAC). This was a  judicial  review
    challenge in which the applicant challenged the  respondent's  decision
    to refuse to grant leave outside the  Immigration  Rules.  That  appeal
    involved an applicant who sought leave to continue as the carer  of  an
    elderly couple.

54. Importantly it is clear from  reading  that  decision  that  there  was
    considerable medical and other evidence before the Tribunal. I did  not
    have such medical or other evidence.  Additionally,  the  applicant  in
    that appeal had been employed as a carer.

55. In the appeal but I am dealing with there is not only  the  appellant's
    wife who could provide care for her father but there is also the option
    of other family members. Having read the Sison decision  I  find  there
    are many differences in facts.

56. The appellant lawfully entered the United Kingdom as a  spouse  but  in
    order to extend his  stay  he  had  to  meet  the  requirement  of  the
    Immigration Rules. He could not satisfy the financial  requirements  of
    those Rules.

57. Applying section 117B of the 2002 Act  he  gave  evidence  through  the
    interpreter and did not demonstrate any ability in English although  an
    ability to speak English is considered at best a neutral factor.  Their
    only income is the appellant's wife's annual salary of  �7500  although
    this income is supplemented by a carer's allowance  that  she  receives
    for her father from the Government. I  accept  the  relationship  began
    lawfully as they were married before he arrived in the United Kingdom.

58. I have to consider whether the circumstances  that  I  have  considered
    above amount to either exceptional  or  compelling  circumstances  that
    would enable me to allow this appeal on article 8 grounds.

59. The failure to comply with  the  Immigration  Rules  is  a  significant
    factor. The mere fact the appellant and his wife are  in  a  subsisting
    relationship is insufficient to make  removal  disproportionate.  There
    are options available for the appellant by way of  an  entry  clearance
    application and of course there was the opportunity for  the  appellant
    to have adduced further evidence to support the medical argument  which
    is advanced.

60. It goes without saying that if there had been stronger medical evidence
    this appeal may have succeeded but  based  on  the  evidence  currently
    before me I am satisfied it would not be  disproportionate  to  require
    the appellant to leave the United Kingdom. In reaching this decision  I
    have had regard to the full circumstances of the case.

    DECISION

61. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I set aside the decision.

62. I dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.
