For the Appellant:     Mr S Mustafa, Counsel, instructed by Jade Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is a national of India, born in  1987.  On  11  August
       2017 he applied for a residence card  pursuant  to  the  Immigration
       (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (the 2016 Regulations)  as
       confirmation of his right to reside in the UK as the  former  family
       member of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights  who  retained  a
       right of residence.


    2. In a decision dated 13 November 2017 the respondent stated that  the
       appellant had not provided  adequate  evidence  that  he  was  in  a
       genuine relationship, that interview notes form a  'pastoral  visit'
       disclosed  'vague',  'less  than  forthcoming'  and  'contradictory'
       answers in respect of the claimed relationship and the breakdown  of
       the  marriage,  and  that  the  marriage  was   therefore   one   of
       convenience.


    3. The appellant lodged an appeal with  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
       appellant paid a fee of ï¿½80, the appropriate sum for an appeal to be
       determined on the papers without an oral  hearing.  On  20  December
       2017 the First-tier Tribunal issued direction to  the  parties.  The
       directions issued to the appellant required any written evidence and
       submissions  to  be  served  on  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the
       respondent by 17 January 2018. A similar direction was issued to the
       respondent.

    4. Attached to the case file is a bundle of documents, addressed to the
       First-tier Tribunal and dated 17 January2018.  There  is  manuscript
       writing in pencil reading 'PHC 18/1/2018', and  a  reference  to  'J
       Lawrence @ H'worth'. There is a formal 'Hatton Cross Received' stamp
       dated '19 Jan 2018', and a 'Harmondsworth HC  Received'  note  dated
       '22  Jan  2018'.  An  email  received  from  the  appellant's  legal
       representatives, sent at 11:09 on 31 January 2018, claims  that  the
       appellant's bundle of documents was served on person to  IAC  Hatton
       Cross on 18/01/2018. An email response from  IAC  Customer  Service,
       dated 6 February  2018,  states  that,  according  to  the  relevant
       database, the appellant's bundle of documents was received at Hatton
       Cross on 19 January 2018 and linked to the file on 22 January 2018.

    5. Although there  is  no  entirely  clear  picture  of  events,  I  am
       satisfied that the appellant's bundle was served on  the  First-tier
       Tribunal after 17 January 2018, and that the  most  likely  date  of
       service is 19 January 2018.

    6. In a decision stating that it was 'heard'  at  Harmondsworth  on  18
       January 2018, but which is signed and dated  21  January  2018,  and
       which was promulgated on 29 January 2018, Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal NMK Lawrence (the judge) dismissed the appeal noting, inter
       alia, that appellant's grounds were not supported by any evidence.

    7. It seems that the judge was not made unaware that, despite being  in
       breach of  the  deadline  contained  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
       Directions, the appellant had in fact provided a bundle of documents
       running to 196 pages and containing a skeleton argument,  a  witness
       statement from the appellant, documents relating to the  appellant's
       ex-wife,  including  evidence  of  her  employment  and   place   of
       residence, and photographs.

    8. I am satisfied, having regard to the aforementioned  evidence,  that
       the First-tier Tribunal did receive the 196-page bundle of  evidence
       prior to the date that the judge signed his decision, and  prior  to
       the date on which the decision was promulgated. E & R v Secretary of
       State for the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 49  is  authority  for
       the proposition that a Tribunal is seized of an appeal up until  the
       date its decision is promulgated. Moreover, a successful  appeal  is
       not dependent on the demonstration of some failing on  the  part  of
       the Tribunal and an error of law may be found to  have  occurred  in
       circumstances where some material evidence, through no fault of  the
       Tribunal,  was  not  considered,  with  resulting   unfairness   (MM
       (unfairness; E & R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 00105 (IAC)). I  fully  accept
       that the appellant did not comply with the directions, but the judge
       did not dismiss the appeal because of a failure to comply  with  the
       directions.  The judge was apparently unaware of  the  existence  of
       materially relevant documents that were within the possession of the
       First-tier Tribunal.

    9. In my judgment the administrative staff at Hatton  Cross  failed  to
       attach the bundle of documents to the file in  an  expedient  manner
       and, as a result, the judge either did not have  the  bundle  before
       him when the decision was made, or was  not  made  aware,  after  he
       reached his decision but before it was  promulgated,  that  a  large
       bundle had been provided to the First-tier  Tribunal.  Although  the
       judge is blameless for his failure to consider evidence that was not
       before him I am satisfied, given the history of  this  matter,  that
       there has been a procedural impropriety  sufficient  to  render  the
       decision unsafe as relevant evidence was not taken into  account  by
       the judge even though it was in  the  Tribunal's  possession.  I  am
       satisfied that this constitutes a material error of law.

   10. In these circumstances where there has been no proper  consideration
       of the application by the First-tier Tribunal, and  further  to  7.2
       (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement,  it  is  appropriate  to
       remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  considered
       afresh before a judge other than Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       NMK Lawrence.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside  as  it  involved  the
making of an error of law on a point of law.

The case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.

As  the  appellant  initially  requested  a  paper  hearing  the  First-tier
Tribunal will consider the appeal on the papers unless the  appellant  makes
any application, and pays the requisite fee, to have his  appeal  considered
at an oral hearing.

No anonymity direction is made.
