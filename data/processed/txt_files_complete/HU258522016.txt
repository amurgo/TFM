                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant who was born on the 16th of August 1967 and is a citizen
   of the Philippines is the spouse of the Sponsor, a British national. On
   the 31st of August 2016 she applied for entry clearance as the spouse.
   The application was refused for the reasons given in the Refusal Notice
   of the 27th of March 2017 and the decision upheld on review. The
   Appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow at
   Taylor House on the 4th of July 2017 and dismissed in a decision
   promulgated on the 10th of August 2017. The Appellant was granted
   permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal leading to the hearing before
   me.

2. In the Refusal Notice it was accepted that the Appellant met the
   suitability and eligibility requirements of the Immigration Rules. The
   Sponsor was not exempt from the financial requirements of the Immigration
   Rules or the evidential requirements. The Appellant had not provided the
   required payslips for the Sponsor or any of the supporting documentation
   such as matching bank statements and the employer's letter relating to
   the 28 days before the application. In addition the ECO was not satisfied
   that the accommodation requirement was met.

3. The decision was upheld by the ECM on review. It was noted that
   additional documentation had been submitted but the original decision was
   correct on the information before the ECO at the time. The Sponsor had
   still not provided evidence in the 6 months before the application was
   made. There was an unexplained payment of ï¿½7,000 which was unaccounted.
   The ECM did not consider that the evidential balance had tipped in the
   Appellant's favour.

4. In the decision the Judge stated in paragraph 2 "The appeal is to be
   determined upon the evidence of the circumstances appertaining at the
   time of the decision to refuse." The Appellant had sought for the appeal
   to be determined on the papers and that had led to correspondence with
   the Tribunal before the appeal was listed but that did not lead to any
   further evidence being provided. The Judge summarised the Respondent's
   case and the grounds of appeal before turning to the ECM review. Having
   then set out the relevant parts of Appendix FM and FM-SE the Judge noted
   in paragraph 12 that the additional documents did not assist in showing
   that she met the requirements at the date of the application.

5. In paragraph 13 it was noted that evidential flexibility had not been
   raised but that in any event the Appellant had not produced 6 months wage
   slips prior to the date of the application and found that the evidence
   did not show that the Sponsor was occupying the new accommodation he had
   obtained. At the end of paragraph 14, following a discussion of the legal
   position, the Judge found that the rules had not been met and that no
   significant factors or private interest had been put forward that
   outweighed the public interest reflected in the rules. There were no good
   reasons to consider her case outside the rules.


6. For the hearing there was no rule 24 reply from the ECO. It was accepted
   that the Appellant had not submitted the specified evidence with the
   application. It was argued that the Judge had erred under section 85(5)
   although as that relates to a new matter and the Secretary of State's
   consent it is not clear how that would assist the Appellant. the argument
   was that the Judge erred in the proportionality assessment and failed to
   take into account that evidence was subsequently provided.


7. In spouse applications the provisions of the Immigration Rules set out
   in Appendix FM and FM-SE are clear and unambiguous as to what evidence
   has to be provided with the application, the period of time that it
   relates to and what it has to show in terms of minimum earnings and
   accommodation. The rules have been in force for nearly 6 years now and
   whilst tedious in their requirements they have been upheld and so apply
   to this Appellant as to any other.


8. The fact that the Appellant did not submit specified evidence with the
   application is not disputed. For that reason the Appellant could not meet
   the Immigration Rules and the Judge was right to find that. The only way
   in which the rules could have been met is if the further information was
   submitted through the provisions of the rules relating to evidential
   flexibility and those provisions were not engaged in this decision.


9. Whether the further information provided showed that there was adequate
   accommodation does not assist the Appellant. The financial information
   was still missing the required wage slips pre-application and the
   submission of the documentation with the Notice and Grounds of Appeal did
   not address the basic problem - that they had not been submitted with the
   application. No explanation has been forthcoming for their absence.


10. The Immigration Rules are relevant to the assessment of proportionality
   in respect of human rights decisions and form the basis for the
   assessment of the public interest in the maintenance of immigration
   control. There is a clear difference between being unable to meet the
   requirements of the Immigration Rules and being in a situation not
   contemplated by the Immigration Rules. If an Appellant does not meet the
   Immigration Rules then compelling reasons are required to justify a grant
   of leave under article 8 outside the terms of the Immigration Rules.


11. The clear aim of the provisions of Appendix FM and FM-SE is that the
   complete application should be reviewed by the ECO and that all evidence
   should be submitted with the application. The provisions of evidential
   flexibility allow for leeway in the presentation of evidence but the
   scheme is clearly intended to ensure that applications are not later
   supplemented by information that an ECO has not had a proper opportunity
   to consider.


12. In this case the Judge found that there was still information missing
   that should have been submitted. Putting that to one side even if the
   Appellant had submitted all the specified evidence with the Notice and
   Grounds of Appeal the Appellant would still not have met the Immigration
   Rules as the evidence had not been submitted with the application itself.




13. To justify a grant of leave outside the rules the Appellant would have
   to show that there were circumstances that justified her not having to
   comply with the requirements of Appendix FM or FM-SE. The Judge found
   that there were none and the grounds do not point to any factor that
   could be said to be compelling. The evidence that now suggested that the
   Sponsor did meet the financial requirements can be put together in the
   appropriate format and submitted with a renewed application, the
   Appellant is in the same position as any other spouse applicant.


14. On the evidence before the Judge the finding that the Appellant did not
   meet the Immigration Rules was clearly correct. The Judge properly looked
   for factors that would justify consideration of the appeal outside the
   Immigration Rules and found that there were none. The grounds do not show
   that the Judge erred in the approach taken or in the conclusions drawn.
   The decision of Judge Callow did not contain an error of law and stands
   as the disposal of this appeal.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

Fee Award

In dismissing this appeal I make no fee award.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
