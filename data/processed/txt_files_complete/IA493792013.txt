                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1.  The  appellant  is  a  citizen  of  Kosovo  who  appeals  against  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge L K Gibbs promulgated on  25
    April 2014 in which she dismissed the appellant's  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of  State  to  refuse  his  claim  under  the
    provisions of paragraph 276ADE with reference to paragraphs 353B and s.
    55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  The facts  of
    the case can be relatively swiftly stated.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Kosovo.  He was born on 3 June 1981.   He
    married a British citizen, Elma Mata, in Kosovo on 11 August 2010.  The
    couple have a son who was born in the United Kingdom on 30  July  2012.
    He applied in 2010 for a visit visa to visit  his  wife  but  this  was
    refused.  It can safely be said that he had no intention  of  remaining
    merely as a temporary visitor and that it was  at  all  times,  as  his
    subsequent activities demonstrate,  his  intention  to  settle  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Having failed in his application for a visit  visa  in
    2010, he took the law into his own hands and, after his child was  born
    in July 2012, he himself entered the United Kingdom, unlawfully, on  15
    December 2012 and then applied on 26 February 2013 for leave to  remain
    on the basis of his marriage and because he had a child.  In  addition,
    he claimed to have a fear of returning to Kosovo.  The latter point was
    swiftly dealt with by his Counsel at  the  opening  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing when Mr O'Callaghan, who then appeared  on  behalf  of
    the appellant, withdrew any  suggestion  that  this  claim  raised  any
    Article 3 issues.  In other words the  claim  that  he  had  previously
    advanced that he was objectively at risk of harm, was not one which was
    well-founded.

 3. The child born on 30 July 2012 is now 20 months old.  He  has  a  step-
    sister, the result of a former relationship of  the  appellant's  wife,
    who is 4 years of age.  Both children are British citizens.  The  judge
    in paragraph 24 of the determination expressly referred to the words of
    Lady Hale in the case of ZH (Tanzania) [2011] 2 AC 166; [2011]  UKSC  4
    to the effect that although a British citizen  child  is  not  a  trump
    card, it is a matter of particular importance  in  assessing  the  best
    interests of any child.  I have no reason at  all  to  doubt  that  the
    judge took that into account, as she professed to do  by  reference  to
    that passage of the judgment of Lady Hale.  These are the  bald  facts.
    The appellant seeks to avoid complying with  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The application that he has made is an  attempt  to
    circumvent the maintenance provisions of the Immigration Rules.   Those
    maintenance provisions are now said to be lawful and they are  designed
    to prevent a recourse to public funds in circumstances  where  the  net
    result is that the taxpayer has to fund the arrival of the applicant.

 4. The particularly unsatisfactory circumstances of this case are that, as
    the judge found, the appellant and his wife are  not  currently  living
    together.  She lives in Ilford whilst the appellant lives in Streatham.
     They do not live together, it was said by Ms Mata, because  were  they
    to do so, she would lose her benefits.  So it is one of those  features
    of this case that both the appellant and his wife are well aware of the
    need to rely upon benefits as the means by which they are able to  live
    in the United Kingdom.

 5. It is a matter of some interest as to whether the appellant's wife  has
    links with Kosovo.  It is slightly muddled by the  fact  that  although
    her parents had originally advanced a claim on the basis that they were
    citizens of Kosovo, they  have  since  retracted  that  case  and  have
    conceded that they were Albanian citizens.  It follows from  this  that
    the appellant's wife is herself  an  Albanian  citizen  rather  than  a
    Kosovan.  However the couple speak Albanian and the wife has  certainly
    been to Kosovo because it is accepted this is  where  she  married  the
    appellant on 11 August 2010.  Since the child was born on 30 July  2012
    in the United Kingdom, it raises an issue as to  where  the  child  was
    conceived.  The appellant says that he entered the United Kingdom  only
    on 15 December 2012 and consequently could not have been present in the
    United Kingdom when the child was conceived towards the  end  of  2011,
    probably in October or November.  When  I  asked  Mr  Harding  to  take
    instructions from Ms Mata as to whether she  was  in  Kosovo  when  the
    child was conceived or whether the father was in the United Kingdom  in
    October or November 2011 contrary to  his  instructions,  she  told  Mr
    Harding on instructions that the child was conceived by a  specimen  of
    the appellant's sperm being sent by post to  the  United  Kingdom  from
    which the appellant's spouse fertilised herself without  medical  help.
    I am not going to decide this case on the  basis  of  any  findings  in
    relation to that statement because I have not heard  evidence  from  Ms
    Mata nor do I intend to  do  so.   However  it  does  not  exclude  the
    possibility that the appellant's wife as a British citizen was able  to
    travel to Kosovo, had she chosen to do so, at the end of 2011.

 6. The nub of the appeal is that it is said on  behalf  of  the  appellant
    that the requirements of the Immigration Rules should not  be  seen  as
    being applied in this case because the consequences of  an  application
    of the maintenance requirements of the Rules would lead to an  unlawful
    interference with the right of the British child now aged 20 months  to
    enjoy the fruits of British nationality or alternatively the fruits  of
    living with her father, the appellant,  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    judge dealt with the balance that had to be  struck  in  paragraphs  24
    onwards of the determination.  Having set out the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules, she went on to consider whether EX1 applied and,  in
    particular, whether there were insurmountable obstacles to family  life
    continuing outside the United Kingdom.  She properly analysed that  the
    focus of this assessment was the impact upon the children.

 7. In paragraph 25 it is said that she placed significant  weight  on  the
    fact that the children are British but that she  had  to  consider  the
    wider facts of this appeal including the ages of the children and their
    ties here.  She acknowledged that in moving out of the  United  Kingdom
    both children would lose the advantages of growing  up  in  the  United
    Kingdom but she correctly pointed  out  that  the  children  were  very
    young.  Indeed in paragraph 26 she properly described them as being too
    young to have social links  here  and  that  they  should  properly  be
    regarded as two children growing up in a household where their  parents
    speak Albanian to one another.  That is of course something that  would
    be replicated were they to go either to Albania or Kosovo as  would  be
    the likely destination in this  case.   The  judge  however  took  into
    account the fact that the  children's  relatives  live  in  the  United
    Kingdom but she also placed weight on the  fact  that  the  appellant's
    wife was born in Albania and that her family were  originally  Albanian
    nationals  themselves.   Accordingly,  the  judge,  correctly   in   my
    judgment, identified the children's cultural heritage as a  mixture  of
    British and Albanian and Kosovan and therefore the  circumstances  were
    very  different  from  those  in  ZH  (Tanzania)  to  which  she   paid
    considerable regard in the determination.

 8. Most importantly she accepted that the best interests of  both  of  the
    children were to remain with their mother and that in the circumstances
    of this case that  this  also  meant  that  they  should  be  with  the
    appellant as the father of the little boy  aged  20  months.   In  that
    regard  she  took  into  account  the  circumstances  in  Kosovo.   The
    appellant's own evidence was that  he  had  succeeded  in  business  in
    Kosovo and that he was able to accumulate a sum in excess of ï¿½6,000  in
    order to come to the United Kingdom.  She also took into  account  that
    the evidence of the appellant had been equivocal in seeking to minimise
    the links that he had with Kosovo and the family members that he had in
    order  to  enhance  his  claim.   She  regarded  the  appellant  wholly
    rationally as having reasonable prospects of future financial success.

 9. The determination was entirely reasonable based on the circumstances as
    I have set out above.  The judge then went on, once again properly,  to
    look at the case of Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct  approach)
    [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) amongst other  cases  dealing  with  the  correct
    approach to Article 8.  I have no doubt whatsoever that she applied the
    right test in dealing with the case in that way.

10. The essence of the applicant's case is that the law as a combination of
    Article 8 and the Immigration Rules  should  permit  the  applicant  to
    enter the United Kingdom.  But that principle is subject to the proviso
    that he was required to satisfy the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules as a spouse.  If the couple decided to marry and to have a  child
    as they did, they had no right to expect that they  would  be  able  to
    achieve what they seek to achieve, that is, having the  appellant  join
    the family in the United Kingdom  unless  he  also  complied  with  the
    Immigration Rules.  The choice they had was a simple one.  They  either
    had to meet the Immigration Rules or they might chose to  remain  as  a
    family in Kosovo or indeed in Albania if that is where  they  chose  to
    settle where they could be together.  There were advantages in both  of
    those situations.  There was the advantage of the child  being  brought
    up in the United  Kingdom  but  without  a  father  present  unless  he
    complied with the requirements of the Immigration Rules  or  there  was
    the option of the entire family moving to Kosovo where they could live,
    where there were prospects of  work,  where  there  had  been  evidence
    provided that the appellant had been able to live comfortably and where
    he had family members.  Those were the two options that were  available
    to them and they are still available to them.  What is not  an  option,
    in my judgment,  is  that  Article  8  imposes  the  outcome  that  the
    appellant and his wife can determine - because they have a son who is a
    United Kingdom citizen - the place where they wish and would prefer  to
    settle, that is, the United Kingdom.  That in my  judgment  is  not  an
    alternative or an option which must be  imposed  as  a  result  of  the
    application  of  Article  8  and/or  the  operation  of  s.  55  and  a
    consideration of the best interests of the children.

11. In those circumstances I am quite satisfied that the judge reached  the
    correct conclusion and was entirely correct in saying that  the  appeal
    of the appellant should be dismissed.

DECISION

    The  Judge  made  no  error  on  a  point  of  law  and  the   original
    determination of the appeal shall stand.
