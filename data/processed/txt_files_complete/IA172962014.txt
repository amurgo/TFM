                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing  her  appeal  against  the  decision  to
    refuse to grant her leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  2
    General Migrant, and  against  the  Secretary  of  State's  concomitant
    decision to remove her from the UK by way of directions  under  Section
    47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that the appellant requires anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission

 2. On 15 May 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson gave his reasons for
    granting the appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal:

         2.   The appellant applied for leave to remain as a Tier 2 migrant.
              The judge considered her  appeal  against  that  refusal  and
             found that her Certificate of Sponsorship had  been  withdrawn
             and thus that she was not entitled to the claimed points.

         3.   Ground 1 contends that the Certificate of Sponsorship had  not
             been  withdrawn.   The  ground  refers  to  a  copy   of   the
             certificate at page 44 of the appellant's bundle, which  shows
             the status of the Certificate as "used" and  gives  an  expiry
             date of 16 February 2014.   The  appellant's  application  was
             received by the respondent  on  14  February  2014,  two  days
             before the certificate expired,  and  in  those  circumstances
             ground 1 contends that the respondent's guidance at page 46 of
             the bundle obliged the respondent to change  the  status  from
             expired/used when considering the application.  In  the  light
             of this evidence, it is  arguable  that  the  judge  erred  in
             concluding that the Certificate was withdrawn and  in  finding
             that the refusal of the Tier 2 application was  in  accordance
             with the law.

         4.   That, however, is not the  end  of  the  matter,  because  the
             appellant actually  had  no  right  of  appeal  under  section
             82(2)(d) of the 2002 Act against the refusal  of  the  Tier  2
             application as the refusal did not result  in  her  having  no
             leave to remain - her leave to remain expired  2  days  before
             the application was submitted when  she  withdrew  an  earlier
             appeal.  Thus  her  only  right  of  appeal  lay  against  the
             decision to remove her.

         5.   In those circumstances, it is questionable whether ground 1 or
             any of the other  grounds,  which  essentially  challenge  the
             refusal of the Tier  2  application,  can  have  any  material
             bearing on the outcome of the appeal.

         6.   Nonetheless, I will grant permission on the ground  1  because
             it is arguable that, if the appellant  had  been  entitled  to
             succeed on her  Tier  2  application,  that  might  have  some
             bearing on the issue of  proportionality  in  the  context  of
             article 8 (although by  the  date  of  the  hearing,  she  had
             overstayed for more than 28 days for the purposes of paragraph
             245HD(p) of the rules).  I do not  refuse  permission  on  the
             other grounds.

The Appellant's Material History

 3. The appellant is a national of Nigeria,  whose  date  of  birth  is  11
    November 1986.  She first arrived in the United Kingdom  on  2  October
    2005 with valid entry clearance as a student.  She remained lawfully in
    the United Kingdom in the capacity of a student until 29 November 2010,
    when she was granted leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  Post-Study  Work
    Migrant until 29 November 2012.  On 28 November 2012  she  applied  for
    further leave to remain as the unmarried partner of a British national,
    but her application was refused on 22 July 2013.  She appealed  against
    the refusal, but subsequently withdrew her appeal on 10 February  2014.
    Throughout this period she was employed by the Care Quality Commission.

 4. Following the withdrawal of her appeal, the appellant applied for leave
    to remain as a Tier 2 Migrant.  In her application form, she relied  on
    a certificate of sponsorship  assigned  to  her  by  the  Care  Quality
    Commission on 15 November 2013.

 5. The application was made on 14 February 2014, and  was  refused  on  21
    March 2014.  The reason for refusal was the Secretary of State was  not
    satisfied she had provided a valid certificate of sponsorship reference
    number.  The certificate of sponsorship reference number which she  had
    provided had been withdrawn by her sponsor, and therefore she could not
    be awarded points for sponsorship.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Khawar sitting at Hatton Cross
    in the First-tier Tribunal on 19  November  2014.   Both  parties  were
    legally represented.  The appellant adopted as her evidence-in-chief  a
    witness statement in which she said she had first started  working  for
    the Care Quality Commission as an administrator in March 2011.  At that
    time, she was on a salary of �14,800 per annum.  She was later promoted
    to the role of a data analyst, with an annual  income  of  �29,245  per
    annum.  She started this role on 12 August 2013.  She had withdrawn her
    human rights appeal on the advice of her solicitors.  After  consulting
    the Home Office,  the  CQC  terminated  her  employment  contract  with
    immediate effect on 17 February 2014, and unfortunately did  not  renew
    her certificate of sponsorship while her application was pending due to
    the advice they received from the Home Office that she did not  have  a
    right to work, as her human rights appeal had been withdrawn.

 7. Her legal representative submitted that at the date of application  she
    had a perfectly valid certificate of sponsorship (whose expiry date was
    16 February 2014) and that the respondent had been wrong to  treat  the
    certificate of sponsorship as being withdrawn.

 8. The material findings of the judge were at paragraphs 14 to 17  of  his
    subsequent decision, and I reproduce these paragraphs below:

         14.  The Appellant's case is fully particularised in her Grounds of
             Appeal in which she contends that the Respondent's decision is
             not in accordance with the law.  However she fails to identify
             the law and the alleged breach  thereof.   She  also  contends
             that the Respondent's decision is unlawful under Section 6  of
             the Human Rights Act 1998  as  it  is  incompatible  with  her
             Convention rights because she believes  that  her  application
             meets the requirements of the UK laws, and  it  ought  not  to
             have been refused and the Home Office should  have  'exercised
             discretion in the right way' (paragraph 8 of  her  Grounds  of
             Appeal).  Yet again, there is a failure to  identify  the  law
             which she claims the Respondent has breached.   The  Appellant
             also contends that the Respondent's decision  is  incompatible
             with Article 8 of the ECHR because it  is  in  breach  of  her
             right to respect for private and family  life  in  the  United
             Kingdom.  There is no elaboration of the  private  and  family
             life in the United Kingdom.  Finally  the  Appellant  contends
             that she is entitled  to  rely  on  DS  Abdi  [1996]  and  the
             'Judicial undertone' following from the decision therein.  The
             Appellant has failed to identify any  published  policy  which
             the Respondent has allegedly not taken into account.

         15.  Having considered all evidence and the law and for the reasons
             set out below I do not find in favour of the Appellant.

         16.  It is evident from the Chronology set out  herein  above  that
             two days prior to the  Appellant's  current  application,  she
             withdrew her appeal in relation to  the  Respondent's  Refusal
             dated 22nd July 2013.  The effect of that withdrawal  is  that
             the Appellant no longer had any valid  leave  to  remain  post
             29th November 2012.  It is also apparent  from  correspondence
             contained in the Appellant's bundle (pages 32  -  40  thereof)
             that upon being informed the Appellant no longer had  a  right
             to work her Sponsor/employer,  the  Care  quality  Commission,
             withdrew the Certificate of Sponsorship.  The  exact  date  on
             which this Certificate of Sponsorship  was  withdrawn  is  not
             apparent from any document submitted either by  the  Appellant
             or the Respondent.  However there can be no doubt that  as  at
             the date of the Respondent's decision the Appellant's  Sponsor
             had withdrawn the Certificate of Sponsorship.

         17.   Consequently  I  can  only  conclude  that  the  Respondent's
             decision is entirely  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  the
             Immigration Rules.  In my judgment, if the Appellant  had  not
             withdrawn her appeal relating  to  the  previous  refusal  but
             simply submitted her current application at a time  when  that
             appeal was still pending, by  virtue  of  Section  3C  of  the
             Immigration Act 1971, her current application would have  been
             deemed as being a Variation Application  during  a  period  of
             extant leave by operation of law.  As such she would  continue
             to have had a valid permission to undertake work and therefore
             there would have been no  justification  for  the  Appellant's
             employer to withdraw the Certificate of Sponsorship.  However,
             because the Appellant withdrew her appeal when  she  did,  two
             days prior to her current application being made, at that time
             she  did  not  have  any  valid  leave  to  remain  under  the
             Immigration Rules/the law.  Consequently  the  Appellant  only
             has  herself  and/or  her  previous  solicitors  to  blame  in
             relation to the circumstances she finds herself in.   She  has
             no legitimate complaint in relation to  the  legality  of  the
             Respondent's decision; as noted above, the Appellant's Grounds
             of Appeal failed to particularise any  aspect  of  her  claims
             made in support of this appeal.  Accordingly  the  Appellant's
             appeal fails under the Immigration Rules and the Law.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

 9. At the hearing before me, I reviewed with  the  parties  the  documents
    that had been before the First-tier Tribunal.

10. The respondent's bundle did not contain a communication from the CQC to
    the effect that the certificate  of  sponsorship  had  been  withdrawn.
    However in the appellant's bundle at pages 41 and following there was a
    file copy of a printout relating to CQC's sponsorship of the  appellant
    which Mr Tarlow accepted must have passed through the hands of the Home
    Office.  The following information was recorded under the title of "CoS
    Number and Status":  the current CoS status was "expired";  the  status
    date was 17 February 2014;  the  date  the  CoS  was  assigned  was  15
    November 2013 and the expiry date (by which the CoS needed to be  used)
    was 16 February 2014; the sponsorship had not been withdrawn,  but  the
    sponsor asked the reader to note  that  the  appellant  was  no  longer
    employed by the CQC.

11. On 11 April 2014 the appellant e-mailed the HR department  of  the  CQC
    requesting to know when her certificate of  sponsorship  was  withdrawn
    and why.  In a letter dated 11 April 2014 the CQC addressed a number of
    grievance concerns raised by the appellant, including the  question  of
    withdrawal of sponsorship by CQC.  The writer said that she  was  aware
    that the appellant's sponsorship with CQC expired on 16 February  2014.
    As they had received advice from the UK Border Agency (on  17  February
    2014) that confirmed she was no longer eligible to work in the UK,  CQC
    could not continue to employ her.  As she was no longer  employed,  CQC
    were not in a position to renew her sponsorship.  She  understood  that
    the appellant had submitted an application for a new visa, but as  this
    had  only  been  received  by  the  Home  Office  after  her  visa  and
    sponsorship had expired, the Home Office confirmed that  her  right  to
    work in the UK had been withdrawn.

12. Mr Akindele referred me to a step-by-step guide for sponsors issued  by
    the respondent.  He  submitted  that  the  table  at  page  46  of  the
    appellant's  bundle  showed  that  the  refusal  letter   had   wrongly
    characterised the certificate of sponsorship as  being  withdrawn.   It
    should have been treated as "used" as it had not expired by the date of
    application, and it had been used before the expiry date to support the
    appellant's application for leave to remain.

13. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Tarlow accepted that the  wrong
    terminology may have been used, but said it did not make  any  material
    difference.  By the  date  of  decision  the  appellant's  contract  of
    employment with  CQC  had  been  terminated  and  there  was  no  valid
    certificate of sponsorship in existence.

Discussion

14. It is clear from the documentary evidence that it is  not  accurate  to
    characterise  the  sponsor  as  having  withdrawn  the  certificate  of
    sponsorship issued to the appellant in  November  2013.   The  relevant
    sequence of events was  as  follows:  the  certificate  of  sponsorship
    expired on 16 February 2014;  the  Home  Office  received  the  Tier  2
    application (made  on  14  February  2014)  on  17  February  2014  and
    immediately contacted the CQC to inform them that the appellant was not
    entitled to work for them on account of her recent immigration history.
     As a result of this communication, the CQC immediately terminated  the
    appellant's contract of employment, and did not renew  the  certificate
    of sponsorship.

15. Because the appellant had "used" the certificate of sponsorship to make
    an application for leave to remain  two  days  before  the  certificate
    expired, in the normal course of events her certificate of  sponsorship
    would still have fallen to be treated as valid at the date of decision.
     In the normal course of events it would not have  been  necessary  for
    the sponsor to renew the certificate.

16. But the effect of the appellant's withdrawal of her human rights appeal
    was to render her presence in the country unlawful from the date of the
    refusal  of  the  earlier  application  in  July  2013;  and  thus   it
    retrospectively invalidated the certificate of  sponsorship  which  had
    been assigned to her in November 2013 on the (retrospectively) mistaken
    understanding that she was permitted to  work.   Moreover  and  in  any
    event, by the date of decision the CQC had terminated  the  appellant's
    employment and had made it abundantly clear both  to  her  and  to  the
    respondent that they were no longer willing or able to sponsor her.

17. Accordingly, the judge did not materially err in  law.  By  terminating
    the appellant's contract, the sponsor  had  effectively  withdrawn  its
    sponsorship of her.  In any event, the appellant did not have  a  valid
    certificate of sponsorship from 17 February 2014 onwards.  Although the
    certificate of sponsorship checking service did not show on  that  date
    that her sponsorship had been withdrawn, it did show that  she  was  no
    longer employed by the sponsor and that  the  previous  certificate  of
    sponsorship had expired.

18. Accordingly, the appellant was not entitled to succeed on  her  Tier  2
    application, and the judge below rightly dismissed her  appeal  against
    the refusal of her Tier 2 application.  The judge gave adequate reasons
    in paragraphs [18] to [23] for dismissing the  appellant's  alternative
    claim under Article 8 ECHR, and the grounds  of  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal do not in terms challenge these findings.


Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
on all grounds raised did not contain an error of law, and  accordingly  the
decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
