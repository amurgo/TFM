Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr M Chowdhury, KC Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing their appeals  against  the  refusal  of
    entry  clearance  for  the  purposes  of  settlement.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity order, and I do  not  consider  that
    such an order is warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellants are all nationals of Bangladesh.   The  first  appellant
    was born on 14 November 1959, and is the father of the second and third
    appellants.  The second appellant was born on 24 March  1994,  and  the
    third appellant was born on 26 April 1995.

    The Refusal of Entry Clearance to the Children

 3. The second and third appellants applied for  entry  clearance  to  join
    their mother in the United Kingdom in March 2012, and their application
    was refused on 3 May 2012.

 4. Following this refusal, the first appellant applied for entry clearance
    with a view to settlement as a spouse.  The sponsor of his  application
    was the mother of the second and third appellants.  The application was
    made just before Appendix FM came into  force,  and  therefore  it  was
    governed by the old Rules.

    The Subsequent Refusal of Entry Clearance to  the  Husband/Father  (and
    another child)

 5. On 18 October 2012 the application was refused on the sole ground  that
    the Entry Clearance Officer  in  Dhaka  was  not  satisfied  the  first
    appellant could, and would be, accommodated adequately without recourse
    to public funds in accommodation which his sponsor  owned  or  occupied
    exclusively,  citing  subparagraph  (iv)  of  paragraph  281   of   the
    Immigration Rules.

 6. Apparently, although this is not referred to in the  refusal  decision,
    there was  a  simultaneous  application  for  entry  clearance  by  the
    couple's youngest child, Fahim Khan, who had been born in Bangladesh in
    July 1998.  This application for entry clearance was refused, and (as I
    was informed at the hearing) it was decided not  to  pursue  an  appeal
    against this refusal.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The appeals of the three appellants came before Judge Lobo  sitting  at
    Taylor House in the First-tier Tribunal on 20 March 2014.  Mr Chowdhury
    appeared on behalf of the appellants, and Ms  Wilsdon,  a  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer, appeared on behalf of the respondent.

 8. The appeal hearing proceeded on the  basis  that  there  was  a  common
    question of fact  affecting  all  three  appeals,  namely  adequacy  of
    maintenance and accommodation.  It was common ground that  the  appeals
    of the children were governed by  paragraph  297.   In  refusing  entry
    clearance to the children, the Entry Clearance  Officer  had  contended
    that they did not qualify for entry clearance under paragraph 297(i)(a)-
    (f).  In particular, he was not satisfied that their mother in  the  UK
    had had sole responsibility for their upbringing.   In  addition,  they
    had not demonstrated there were serious and compelling family or  other
    considerations that made their exclusion from the UK undesirable.   His
    reasoning was that the children, their siblings and  their  father  had
    resided in Bangladesh since their respective births.  Their mother  had
    chosen to leave Bangladesh to settle in the UK of her own choosing  (on
    1 July 2010), leaving all of them behind in Bangladesh.  Therefore, any
    break-up of the family unit was a  direct  consequence  of  a  personal
    choice made by their mother.  While she had lived overseas since 1 July
    2010, their father had remained in Bangladesh, and  they  continued  to
    live with him.  They  stated  in  their  applications  that  they  were
    supported jointly by their parents.

    The determination of Judge Miller in respect of an  earlier  settlement
    application

 9. On the issue of maintenance and accommodation, the  Presenting  Officer
    relied on a previous determination by Judge Miller following a  hearing
    at Taylor House on 13 September 2011.   This  was  a  determination  in
    respect of a previous appeal against the refusal of entry clearance for
    settlement brought by the entire family.  This comprised  Mr  Khan  and
    the  couple's  four  children:  as  well  as  the  children  previously
    mentioned, there is Miss Mahbuba Khanom, who  is  the  second  youngest
    child.  The application of the family had been refused under  paragraph
    281 and 301 of the  Rules  on  the  ground  that  the  maintenance  and
    accommodation requirements  were  not  shown  to  be  met.   The  Entry
    Clearance Officer was not  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  had  provided
    accurate information about her true financial circumstances and income.



10. At the hearing before Judge Miller, the sponsor and her brother,  Jamir
    Hussain, gave oral evidence and were cross-examined.

11. In his subsequent determination, Judge Miller gave detailed reasons for
    finding that the maintenance and accommodation  requirements  were  not
    satisfied.  At paragraph 40, he held that on the  question  of  whether
    the  appellants  would  be  able  to  maintain  themselves  adequately,
    although he accepted the sponsor had produced a  P60  showing  she  was
    employed by Fashion Spice, her brother's business, he was not satisfied
    that such employment would continue beyond such time as entry clearance
    was granted to the  appellants.   With  regard  to  accommodation,  the
    proposal was that the appellants would reside with the sponsor at 72 St
    Margarets Road, a property which  was  owned  by  her  brother  but  in
    respect of which he was paying mortgage payments  of  ï¿½369  per  month.
    The judge was not satisfied that if the appellants went to live at this
    property, there would  not  be  a  real  risk  of  the  property  being
    repossessed.  The core finding which underlay the judge's reasoning was
    that, based upon an analysis of the financial  documentation  provided,
    the sponsor's brother appeared to be finding it very difficult to  make
    ends meet with the running of his business (paragraph 40).

12. The judge concluded at paragraph 41 as follows:

         I regret to say that I have  found  that  although  the  bundle  of
         documentation before me is extensive, as I have highlighted  above,
         I find much of the evidence unreliable, and I do not  consider  the
         evidence presented by the sponsor and  her  brother  to  have  been
         honest.  I am afraid, therefore, that despite the  evidence  of  Mr
         Alam, I do not accept there is a bona fide offer of a  job  to  the
         first appellant, and for all the reasons I have stated above, these
         appeals must inevitably fail.

     Judge Lobo's reliance on the determination of Judge Miller

13. In his subsequent determination,  Judge  Lobo  annexed  as  appendix  A
    paragraphs 33 to 42 of Judge Miller's determination.  He discussed  the
    import of Judge Miller's determination at paragraphs 25 to  29  of  his
    own determination.  He directed  himself  that  the  first  Immigration
    Judge's determination should always be the  starting  point,  but  that
    facts happening since the first determination  could  always  be  taken
    into account by the second judge.

14. At paragraph 30 he observed that in the current appeal  the  appellants
    were relying on the same sponsor, who was herself relying upon the same
    brother for employment and for providing accommodation.   There  was  a
    difference in that the sponsor claimed that she was paying her  brother
    rent, whereas previously she had lived at another property of his rent-
    free.  The sponsor also claimed that she was employed  by  the  brother
    who was her employer in the previous appeal.

15. Judge Lobo held at paragraph 31 that  the  evidence  presented  by  the
    sponsor and her  brother  in  the  previous  appeal  was  found  to  be
    unreliable and dishonest, and the factual matrix of the  appeal  before
    him was more or less identical, save that the sponsor  had  moved  next
    door to another house owned by her brother.  There had been no evidence
    in the appeal before him to answer the very serious points made in  the
    previous determination regarding the business and accountancy practices
    of the brother and the honesty of the  evidence.   There  had  been  no
    explanation as to why the evidence in the appeal before him,  from  the
    same witnesses who had given evidence previously, should be regarded as
    credible in view of the conclusions of Judge Miller.

16. Furthermore, as the judge held at paragraph 33, that there had been  no
    evidence to show that the sponsor had had sole responsibility  for  the
    upbringing of the second  and  third  appellants,  nor  was  there  any
    evidence to show that there were serious and compelling family or other
    considerations that made exclusion of the second and  third  appellants
    undesirable.

17. The judge went on to dismiss the appeals on all grounds raised.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

18. On 22 May 2014 Judge Osborne sitting  as  a  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal granted the appellants  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal for the following reasons:

         I find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to recognise  that
         the sponsor's financial  and  domestic  circumstances  had  changed
         significantly since the 2011 determination - she was now living  in
         a different property and had produced updated documentary  evidence
         which, in my judgment, has  been  inadequately  considered  by  the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge.

The Rule 24 Response

19. On 4 July 2014 John Parkinson of the Specialist Appeals Team settled  a
    Rule 24 response on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer opposing  the
    appeal.  The appellants were still reliant on the claimed income of the
    sponsor derived from her brother.  Under those  circumstances,  it  was
    open to the judge to conclude that  material  concerns  raised  in  the
    first  determination  were  not  addressed.   The  sponsor  was   still
    dependent on her brother for accommodation as well.  Given the  serious
    doubts on income, the matter of the sponsor's claimed savings was not a
    material issue.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

20. At the hearing before me, I reviewed the documentary evidence that  had
    been before the First-tier Tribunal relating to the sponsor's financial
    circumstances at the date of  both  refusal  decisions  in  2012.   The
    sponsor's bank statement showed a steady increase in her credit balance
    over the period of February 2012 to October 2012.  The balance  in  her
    account as of 27 February 2012 was ï¿½3,045, and by 27 October  2012  the
    balance had risen to ï¿½9,269.71.  My attention was  also  drawn  to  two
    P60s for the tax year ended 5  April  2013  in  the  appellants  bundle
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  The P60 issued by  Fashion  Spice  Ltd
    purportedly showed that  she  had  achieved  gross  earnings  from  her
    employment with them of ï¿½17,186.  The P60 issued  by  People  Resources
    showed gross earnings of ï¿½6,000.

21. Mr Bramble submitted there was no error of law in the judge failing  to
    take into account the savings of the appellant, as the judge had  given
    adequate reasons for finding that the sponsor did not have  a  reliable
    source of income, relying as she did  on  employment  by  her  brother.
    Even if it was assumed that the savings in the account  were  genuinely
    available to the sponsor to spend  on  maintaining  her  husband,  they
    would be exhausted in less than a year.

Discussion

22. As I ruled at the hearing, there is no error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    finding that the second and third appellants do not qualify  for  entry
    clearance under paragraph 291(e) or (f).  The judge had to consider the
    circumstances appertaining at the date of the decision  to  refuse  the
    second and third appellants entry  clearance.   Their  father  had  not
    applied simultaneously for entry clearance, and so  the  only  possible
    basis on which they could qualify for entry  clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom  was  that  their  mother  in  the  United  Kingdom  had   sole
    responsibility for their upbringing; or that  there  were  serious  and
    compelling family and other considerations which made exclusion of  the
    second and third appellants undesirable  (in  circumstances  where  the
    parent who was looking  after  them  in  Bangladesh  was  remaining  in
    Bangladesh).

23. Mr Chowdhury sought to rely on the evidence of  the  appellant  in  her
    witness statement before the First-tier Tribunal that her  husband  was
    unable to make a settlement application at the same time as the  second
    and third appellants "due to the  lack  of  relevant  English  language
    requirements".  But this does not change the fact that the  second  and
    third appellants simply did not qualify for entry clearance at the date
    of the refusal decision which is  under  appeal.   The  fact  that  the
    children's appeal was joined to their father's  appeal  does  not  mean
    that the relevant date of assessment is shifted from the date when  the
    children's entry clearance application was refused to the date when the
    father's entry clearance application was refused.

24. Accordingly, the appeals of the children could not  succeed,  and  they
    were rightly dismissed by Judge Lobo.  Since  they  could  not  succeed
    under subparagraph (i) of paragraph  297,  any  error  in  the  judge's
    approach  to  the  question  of  maintenance  and  accommodation  under
    paragraph 297 is not material.

25. I turn to consider whether the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    discloses an error of law in respect of the dismissal of the appeal  of
    the first appellant.  Mr  Bramble  mounted  a  robust  defence  of  the
    judge's findings on maintenance and accommodation, but ultimately I  am
    persuaded that the decision discloses an error of law,  albeit  not  as
    canvassed  before  me  in  oral  argument.   I  find  that  there   was
    inadvertent procedural unfairness in the  judge  not  drawing  a  clear
    distinction between the grounds of refusal directed to the  father,  as
    against  those  directed  to  the  children.   As  against  the   first
    appellant, the Entry Clearance Officer had not in fact raised a concern
    about the sponsor's ability to maintain him in the United Kingdom.  The
    sole  issue  raised  was  over  whether   there   would   be   adequate
    accommodation for the first appellant without recourse to public funds.
     Moreover, the findings of Judge Miller with regard  to  the  sponsor's
    ability  to  maintain  and  accommodate  the  entire  family   do   not
    necessarily hold good for the  significantly  reduced  burden  of  only
    having to maintain and accommodate the  first  appellant,  particularly
    having regard to the amount of savings that the sponsor had accrued  by
    the date when the first appellant  was  refused  entry  clearance.   As
    previously noted, the amount of her savings was considerably greater in
    October 2012  than  it  was  in  May  2012.   By  the  judge  taking  a
    compendious approach to the refusals, the first appellant was  deprived
    of the benefit of a differential analysis which might  have  led  to  a
    different conclusion in respect of his appeal.

The Remaking of the Decision

26. Mr Bramble submitted that, if I found an error of law on  the  question
    of maintenance and accommodation, it would be necessary for there to be
    a rehearing on this issue, as its resolution turns on  the  credibility
    of the sponsor and her brother.

27. However, I do not consider that it would  be  in  accordance  with  the
    overriding objective  for  there  to  be  a  further  hearing  on  this
    question, given the length of time which has elapsed since the date  of
    the refusal decision.  I can fairly and more  conveniently  remake  the
    decision on the narrow basis that the only issue raised  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer against the  first  appellant  in  October  2012  was
    adequacy of accommodation.

28. Having regard to the totality of the evidence that was before the First-
    tier Tribunal, I am prepared to accept that at the time of the  refusal
    decision in October 2012 the sponsor was able to accommodate the  first
    appellant adequately in accommodation which  she  occupied  exclusively
    without recourse to public funds.

29. I have the benefit of hindsight whereas Judge  Miller  was  relying  on
    foresight.  Despite  the  misgivings  about  the  brother's   financial
    situation expressed by Judge Miller in  2011,  the  sponsor  was  still
    being accommodated without recourse to public funds by her brother over
    a year later. To that extent it  does  not  matter  that  there  is  no
    documentary evidence  of  the  sponsor  paying  rent  to  her  brother.
    Further, as pointed out in the grounds  of  appeal,  the  ECO  did  not
    dispute the sponsor's ability to  maintain  the  first  appellant.  The
    property inspection report relied on  in  support  of  the  application
    shows that the first appellant could  be  accommodated  at  the  74  St
    Margarets Road address without overcrowding.

30. But while I find that the first appellant has discharged the burden  of
    proving  that  he  meets  the  requirement  of  paragraph  281  of  the
    Immigration Rules that was put in issue by the Entry Clearance Officer,
    I do not consider it is appropriate to direct that he should be granted
    entry clearance in consequence, having regard to the passage  of  time,
    the discretion which rests with  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  be
    satisfied that there has been no material change of circumstances since
    October 2012 and the need to  have  regard  to  the  interests  of  the
    children under the age of 18 who are being looked after  by  the  first
    appellant in Bangladesh.

Decision

The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the  appeals  of  the
second and third appellants did  not  contain  an  error  of  law,  and  the
decision stands.  The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the
appeal of the first appellant contains an error of law, and accordingly  the
following decision is substituted: the first appellant's appeal against  the
refusal decision of October 2012 is allowed under the Rules, but  I  decline
to  direct  that  the  first  appellant  be  granted  entry   clearance   in
consequence.
