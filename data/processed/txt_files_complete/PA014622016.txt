Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Sellwood, Counsel instructed by Paragon Law
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The  appellant  is  a  citizen  of   Afghanistan   who   appeals   the
    determination of a First-tier judge promulgated on  19  December  2016.
    The appellant claims to have been born on 25 May  2000.   Following  an
    age assessment by Peterborough Social Services he was assessed to  have
    been born on 25 May 1998.

2.   The appellant arrived in the UK in May or June  2015  and  applied  for
    asylum on 1 August 2015 when he was taken  into  care  by  Peterborough
    City Council.

3.   The respondent considered the appellant's application  and  refused  it
    for reasons given in a decision dated 28 January 2016.  The  respondent
    summarised  the  appellant's  claim  in  paragraph  3  of  the  refusal
    decision.  The appellant came from Nangarhar province.  His father  was
    a farmer and had problems with the Taliban  who  wanted  him  to  store
    weapons for them.  The appellant's father had been to  the  police  who
    had told him not to do what the Taliban demanded and when he eventually
    stood up to the Taliban the appellant's father was killed by them.

4.   The Taliban threatened to kill the appellant's  whole  family  if  they
    did not return weapons which the Taliban claimed  were  stored  at  the
    family home.   Arrangements  were  made  for  the  appellant  to  leave
    Afghanistan because he was the oldest son and the appellant's  maternal
    uncle believed that the appellant  faced  the  highest  risk  from  the
    Taliban.  The appellant's mother and siblings went to live in Jalalabad
    where some of the appellant's other relatives  lived.   After  a  short
    time in Jalalabad the appellant's uncle  paid  an  agent  to  take  the
    appellant out of the country.  The appellant went  via  Turkey  through
    various countries including Bulgaria where he  was  arrested,  detained
    and beaten,  arriving  in  the  UK  by  lorry.   The  appellant  feared
    returning  to  Afghanistan  because  the  Taliban  had  threatened  the
    appellant and his family and because there was  fighting  and  violence
    across the country.  The police had not protected his  father  and  the
    appellant did not believe that they would be able to provide  him  with
    protection either.

5.   In considering the appellant's claim the Secretary of State noted  that
    the appellant had provided a detailed account of his history and  while
    some discrepancies had been identified in the interview the  respondent
    concluded:

         "However, taking into account the responses provided, the level  of
         detail in your statement, your age as a minor, and  that  you  were
         informed and instructed by adults at this time,  it  is  considered
         that you have provided a broadly consistent account of your claim."

6.   The respondent then considered whether there was  evidence  to  support
    the appellant's claim in the country  information.   She  concluded  in
    paragraph 18:

         "While  there  is  some  broad  consistency  between  the   country
         information identified and your claim, this material  fact  is  not
         substantiated to the  required  standard.   Consideration  will  be
         given as to whether the benefit of the doubt can be offered."

7.   In paragraph 1 of the decision letter the respondent stated, under  the
    heading "Benefit of the doubt", as follows:

         "I have considered the material facts of your claim that have  been
         left uncertain and whether to accept these aspects of  your  claim.
         It has been concluded that, taking  into  account  your  age  as  a
         minor, under the instructions and  directions  of  adults  on  your
         journey to the UK, and the arduous nature  of  your  journey,  your
         general credibility is upheld.  It is also noted that you went into
         the care of Peterborough Social Services Department on 22 June 2015
         and claimed asylum on 1 August  2015  as  an  unaccompanied  asylum
         seeking child.  You have provided a detailed witness statement  and
         complied with screening and asylum  interview  requirements.   Your
         statements are coherent and plausible and do  not  run  counter  to
         available, specific and general information relevant to your case."


8.   Accordingly the respondent gave the appellant the benefit of the  doubt
    "because all the conditions in paragraph 339L of the Immigration  Rules
    have been met".

    Paragraph 339L reads as follows:

         "339L. It is the duty of the  person  to  substantiate  the  asylum
         claim or establish that they are a person eligible for humanitarian
         protection or substantiate their human rights claim. Where  aspects
         of the person's statements are  not  supported  by  documentary  or
         other evidence, those aspects will not need confirmation  when  all
         of the following conditions are met:
         (i) the person has made a  genuine  effort  to  substantiate  their
         asylum claim or establish that  they  are  a  person  eligible  for
         humanitarian protection or substantiate their human rights claim;
         (ii) all material  factors  at  the  person's  disposal  have  been
         submitted, and a satisfactory explanation  regarding  any  lack  of
         other relevant material has been given;
         (iii)  the  person's  statements  are  found  to  be  coherent  and
         plausible and do not run counter to available specific and  general
         information relevant to the person's case;
         (iv) the person has made an asylum claim  or  sought  to  establish
         that they are a person eligible for humanitarian protection or made
         a human rights claim at the  earliest  possible  time,  unless  the
         person can demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and
         (v) the general credibility of the person has been established."


    The respondent accepted that the appellant's father had been killed  by
    the Taliban for standing up to them and that the Taliban threatened  to
    kill the appellant and the rest of his family.  It  was  accepted  that
    the appellant had demonstrated a genuine subjective fear on  return  to
    his village in Nangarhar province.

9.   The respondent nevertheless found that the appellant could relocate  to
    Jalalabad where he had other relatives and in the light of the  country
    information it would not be unreasonable for the appellant to  live  in
    Jalalabad or Kabul.

10.  The appellant's appeal came before the First-tier judge on 29  November
    2016.  The judge heard oral evidence from the appellant.  She  did  not
    accept that the appellant was a minor as claimed and that aspect of her
    decision does not appear to be in dispute.

11.  The judge reached her conclusions in respect of the appellant's  asylum
    claim in the following extract of her decision:

         "34. It is not disputed by  the  Respondent  that  the  Appellant's
             father was killed by the Taliban  and  that  as  a  result  of
             threats made by the Taliban to his entire family they fled  to
             Jalalabad.  However, the Respondent finds that the  Appellant,
             although  accepting  that  he  has  demonstrated   a   genuine
             subjective fear of  returning  to  his  village  in  the  Koht
             District of Nangarhar, that his genuine subjective fear is not
             objectively  well-founded   because   there   are   areas   in
             Afghanistan to which he could  reasonably  relocate  where  he
             would not face the risk of serious harm.  The Respondent noted
             that the Appellant had said his mother and siblings and  other
             relatives were living in Jalalabad and that he was in  regular
             contact with them and his maternal uncle by telephone and that
             they were well and that the Appellant would  be  returning  to
             Afghanistan with a family support network and  found  that  it
             would be reasonable to expect him to return to live  with  his
             family in Jalalabad or relocate to Kabul.


         35.  I have not found the Appellant's claim that he is no longer in
             contact with his family and he does not know their whereabouts
             to be credible.  The Appellant,  up  until  the  date  of  the
             decision, said he had been in regular contact with his  family
             but following the decision, claims that he has not  been  able
             to speak to his family and has lost contact with them.  I have
             doubt the Appellant's overall credibility given  that  he  has
             many family members who continue to live in the village  where
             the Taliban made the initial threat and  also  has  very  many
             family  members  including  his  close   family,   living   in
             Jalalabad.  As  the  Respondent's  Representative  noted,  the
             Taliban had spoken to the Appellant's uncle and know who he is
             and have identified him but the Appellant  had  never  claimed
             that he was somebody who was at risk or  someone  who  had  to
             leave the home village.  If  the  Appellant  claims  that  the
             Taliban could find him  in  Jalalabad  they  could  much  more
             easily have found his uncle in the village and forced  him  to
             disclose the whereabouts of the Appellant and his family.


         36.  Further, the Appellant says that the threat is targeted at him
             as he is the eldest child.  However,  the  Appellant  has  two
             brothers who would appear to be close in age to  him  although
             he has attempted to distance himself from  claims  as  to  the
             ages he gave for his brothers at his age assessment.  However,
             if there was a genuine threat to the entire family, it is  not
             reasonable that they would have remained in Jalalabad and only
             sent the Appellant out of  the  country.   The  entire  family
             could have relocated elsewhere for considerably less cost than
             it has probably taken in sending  the  Appellant  to  the  UK.
             Until the Appellant's refusal of his asylum claim he had  been
             in regular contact with his family and he had  indicated  that
             they were safe.  It is not credible that if the entire  family
             were at risk that his mother, sister and  brothers  would  not
             also have left Jalalabad with him.


         37.  The Appellant's credibility before me is further put in  doubt
             by his responses to questions about the ages of  his  siblings
             and his parents.  He appeared to say before  me  that  he  had
             been forced by the interpreter to give ages for his  siblings.
             The age assessors found the Appellant engaged  well  with  the
             interpreter and there was never any challenge previously  made
             that the Appellant had not understood or had  been  forced  to
             provide answers during the age assessment.


         38.  The Appellant today has claimed  that  he  fears  the  Taliban
             because they will recruit him as a  suicide  bomber.   He  had
             previously made no mention of this fear.  In his  evidence  he
             said that the Taliban are still after him and looking  for  an
             excuse to kill him or recruit him as a suicide bomber.  It  is
             not credible that the Taliban would need an excuse  to  pursue
             the Appellant.  His own expert has stated that  the  Appellant
             would not be at risk of forced recruitment.


         39.  Also in the hearing, the Appellant said that he had heard that
             the Taliban are still looking for him and his family but  they
             had not managed to find his house.  Again, I do  not  find  it
             credible that if the  Taliban  had  any  serious  interest  in
             locating the Appellant in Jalalabad that they would  not  have
             been able to do so given the existence of  very  close  family
             members in the Appellant's home village and also in  Jalalabad
             City.  I find that the Appellant is likely to have embellished
             his account in response to the refusal letter which,  although
             believing the threats, found that the Appellant would  not  be
             at risk of persecution as he had  safely  relocated  with  his
             family elsewhere.  There was no objective  evidence  that  the
             Appellant submitted showing any steps he had taken to  contact
             his family given his claim that he has suddenly  lost  contact
             with them.


         40.  I find that the Appellant's account lacks  credibility.   Thee
             are clear inconsistencies  in  his  account  which  cannot  be
             attributable to his age and there was no evidence that he  had
             ever claimed that he had any difficulty in  understanding  any
             interpreter.  I find that the Appellant  has  embellished  his
             claim by saying that the Taliban are still seeking him.  I  do
             not find it credible that the  Appellant  does  not  know  the
             whereabouts of his family and I do not find it  credible  that
             he is not in contact with family members in Afghanistan.  I do
             not find the Appellant has established to the lowest  standard
             of proof that he is at risk of persecution  outside  his  home
             area in Afghanistan as claimed and I find that he could safely
             return to Jalalabad or to Kabul.


         41.  I have considered the report of Dr Guistozzi's report and note
             the submission made by the  Respondent's  representative  that
             much of the evidence relied upon by Dr Guistozzi predates  the
             decision in AK and found that the references by the writer  to
             recent years in paragraph 4 (to the  situation  in  Nangarhar)
             referred to reports in 2009 and 2011 which he  submitted  were
             not recent.  In fairness to Dr Guistozzi he  does  mention  an
             INSO report from 2014 showing a rise in insurgent  attacks  in
             Nangarhar and that  much  of  the  recent  fighting  has  been
             internecine  between  the  Taliban  and  Islamic  State.   The
             references in paragraph 5 are to reports  from  2003-2011.   I
             find  that  the  claim  at  paragraph  6  of  the  report   is
             speculative claiming  that  the  killing  of  the  Appellant's
             father has started a  blood  feud  which  was  not  previously
             claimed by the Appellant and is not supported by the evidence;
             which is that his family members continued to live  safely  in
             his home village and in Jalalabad and this is  not  supportive
             of a claim that there is a  blood  feud.   In  any  event  the
             reports that Dr Guistozzi relied upon relating to blood  feuds
             are from 2005 and 2006 and the references to documented  feuds
             provide no details as to  whether  they  were  specific  feuds
             between families or if they were targeted at the Taliban which
             Dr Guistozzi speculates may be why the Taliban will peruse the
             Appellant as they fear he will begin a blood feud against them
             as they killed his father.  Also the report finds  that  there
             has  been  a  slight  increase  in  the  number  of   targeted
             assassinations in 2014.


         42.  I have not believed the Appellant's account that  the  Taliban
             are actively seeking him and his family in Jalalabad and I  do
             not find he would be at risk on return there or to Kabul.


         43.  I concur with the findings  of  the  Respondent  in  that  the
             Appellant has not demonstrated  an  objectively  well  founded
             fear of persecution due  to  reasons  covered  by  the  Geneva
             Convention.  I find the Appellant  has  produced  no  credible
             evidence to substantiate his  claim  that  he  is  of  ongoing
             interest to the Taliban given that large numbers of his family
             remained in his home area without suffering any  ill-treatment
             and that many family members live in Jalalabad.  I do not find
             that the Appellant's profile and history is such that he could
             not safely return to  Jalalabad  to  his  family  or  relocate
             within Kabul where sufficient protection would be available to
             him.  I am also satisfied that the Appellant does have  family
             members to whom he could  rely  upon  for  support  should  he
             return to Afghanistan.


         44.  The Appellant further says he fears persecution on  return  to
             Afghanistan as he would be returning alone as a young man.   I
             have not found the Appellant's account of his circumstances in
             Afghanistan to be credible, as I find it very likely that  his
             family continue to live in Afghanistan.  I  do  not  find  the
             Appellant has presented any credible claim that he is at  risk
             of forcible recruitment by the Taliban."

12.  Grounds of appeal were settled but these  were  not  received  until  9
    January 2017.  It was argued that the judge had not properly considered
    the expert's report in ground 1.  In ground 2 it was  argued  that  the
    judge had made adverse credibility findings on matters not in  dispute.
    The judge had impugned the appellant's general credibility in paragraph
    35 of her decision.  She had made adverse findings on  matters  not  in
    dispute between the parties and  the  error  was  material  as  it  had
    informed her findings on internal relocation.


13.  A First-tier judge considered the application and found it was  out  of
    time and no reasons had been given  to  extend  time.   The  delay  was
    unexplained.  The judge had given adequate reasons  for  rejecting  the
    evidence in any event.  The judge  had  made  findings  on  matters  of
    dispute that had been put to the appellant.   There  were  no  material
    errors of law.

14.  The application was renewed  on  10  February  2017.   The  appellant's
    advisors apologised for the mistake which arose from a misunderstanding
    of the definition of "working day" in the Rules which excluded  various
    days around the Christmas period.  The deadline it was now  appreciated
    was to be calculated by reference to  calendar  days  and  not  working
    days.  The error was not the fault of the appellant.  The error had not
    been appreciated when the initial grounds of appeal had  been  settled.
    An extension of time was requested.  In relation to ground  1  (failure
    adequately to consider the expert evidence) it is helpful  to  set  out
    the detailed challenge as follows:

         "13. As stated in the  previous  grounds  of  appeal,  the  central
             issues for the Tribunal were whether there was sufficiency  of
             protection for the appellant in Afghanistan and whether  there
             was a viable and reasonable internal  relocation  alternative.
             This was because the Appellant's general credibility had  been
             accepted by the Respondent and was not in dispute:  paragraphs
             21 to 23 of the Home Office Refusal Letter.


         14.  The expert evidence of Dr Giustozzi, visiting professor at the
             War Studies Department of Kings College, University of London,
             was relevant to the issues in dispute between the parties  and
             Dr Giustozzi found (inter alia) that:


             a.   the Appellant would be targeted  by  the  Taliban  -  for
                  interrogation in  the  very  least,  as  his  family  were
                  accused of refusing to hand over the weapons cache [5];


             b.   the Taliban would expect the Appellant -  as  the  eldest
                  able-bodied male in his family - to seek [to]  avenge  his
                  father's death [6];


             c.   the Taliban may accuse the Appellant of spying on them as
                  a means of executing him arbitrarily [8];


             d.   the risk to the  Appellant  from  the  Taliban  would  be
                  greatest in his home area, but also in Jalalabad  [9]-[10]
                  and Kabul [22]-[25];


             e.   the Appellant would not be able to hide from the  Taliban
                  in Afghanistan [11]-[14];


             f.   the police are corrupt,  inefficient  and  are  known  to
                  collaborate with  the  Taliban,  they  could  not  provide
                  sufficient of protection [15]-[21], [26];


             g.   it would be very difficult for the Appellant  to  earn  a
                  livelihood if returned [42].


         15.  As  stated  above,  in  refusing  permission,  the  First-tier
             Tribunal judge stated merely that as regards  ground  1,  'the
             judge considers the expert report at paragraph  41  and  gives
             adequate reasons for not accepting the evidence given  by  the
             expert'.


         16.  With respect however, this finding fails to  address  entirely
             the substance of ground 1 and does not in any way engage  with
             the arguments contained therein,  namely  that  the  JFTT  had
             materially erred in failing to take into account  the  country
             expert's evidence (on  the  central  and  material  issues  of
             internal relocation and state protection, given that the  risk
             to the appellant in his home area had already been conceded by
             the Respondent) for at least 3 reasons.


         17.  Firstly, that apart from �6 of the  expert  report,  the  JFTT
             does not otherwise expressly reject or accept the  conclusions
             reached by the expert, save for the  criticism  based  on  the
             dates of the sources, which  itself  is  unfounded.   This  is
             because the  JFTT  criticises  Dr  Giustozzi's  references  to
             reports dated 2005 and 2006 (regarding blood feuds)  as  being
             outdated, when really there was no evidence  before  the  JFTT
             that  the  sources  were  outdated  in  the  sense  of   being
             superseded by later  events  or  subsequent  evidence  to  the
             contrary.  Furthermore, although the JFTT referred to what  he
             considered outdated evidence, he failed to refer  entirely  to
             the additional evidence regarding  blood  feuds  cited  by  Dr
             Giustozzi immediately thereafter, in the same paragraph, which
             are dated 2012 and 2014.  Indeed, no reference is made to  the
             2015 sources (see e.g. tables and maps at �9 of the report and
             footnotes at ��27 and 30) or to the fact that Dr Giustozzi  at
             �1 also notes that he has made several trips to Afghanistan in
             2016.


         18.  Secondly, that in relation to �6  of  the  expert  report  (in
             which Dr Guistozzi concludes  that  on  the  basis  of  Afghan
             social mores, the  Taliban  would  suspect  the  Appellant  to
             avenge  his  father's  death),  the  JFTT  rejects   this   as
             speculative as it 'was not previously claimed by the Appellant
             and is not supported by the evidence [as his]  family  members
             continued to live safely in his  home  village  and  Jalalabad
             [41].  However, whilst the words 'blood feud' may  not  appear
             in the  appellant's  witness  statement,  clearly  it  is  the
             Appellant's evidence in substance that there was a blood  feud
             (see e.g. [25] of the Determination where he  is  recorded  as
             saying 'the custom in the  tribal  region  is  if  someone  is
             killed the person will kill all male members of that family to
             prevent revenge in the future').  Therefore, if the  substance
             of the appellant's  overall  claim  is  considered  fully  and
             properly, it cannot reasonably be said that the Appellant  had
             not referred to a blood feud.  As to the JFTT's second  reason
             for rejecting the report - namely that the Appellant's  family
             have not been harmed - it should  be  noted  that  the  report
             suggests that pre-pubescent males and females are not targeted
             [6].  Even on the basis that  the  Appellant's  brothers  were
             aged 12/13 (and not younger) in 2015 when he  claimed  asylum,
             they would remain pre-pubescent at the date of the hearing and
             so not yet at risk.  It was therefore submitted that this  was
             not a proper basis, for rejecting the report's conclusions  as
             'speculative'.


         19.  Finally, that the JFTT did not engage at all with the expert's
             conclusions on how the Taliban would be  capable  of  locating
             the Appellant and the absence of  sufficient  protection  from
             the police (as summarised at �4(d)-(f) above)."

15.  The challenge in ground 2 was as before.  The  judge  had  gone  behind
    the concessions as to the appellant's general credibility.

16.  Permission to appeal was granted by  an  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  on  15
    March 2017.  The judge granted permission principally on the points set
    out at paragraphs 18 to 19 of the grounds which I have reproduced above
    and for the reasons  given  in  ground  2  -  the  appellant's  general
    credibility having been impugned when it was not in issue.   The  Upper
    Tribunal Judge found:

         "It is arguable that the judge has failed to take into account  the
         expert report in relation to why the appellant's siblings  may  not
         have been targeted and may have been able to remain in Afghanistan.
          It is also arguable that the judge has failed  to  deal  with  the
         expert's  evidence  as  to  protection  from  the  Taliban  if  the
         appellant were to relocate elsewhere in Afghanistan.   In  relation
         to ground 2, while the judge has given  a  number  of  reasons  for
         finding the  appellant  not  credible  which  ultimately  may  have
         entitled her to find against him, the respondent had accepted  that
         the appellant's claim as to risk in his home area was credible.  It
         is arguable  that  if  the  judge  intended  to  find  against  the
         appellant in  relation  to  the  core  of  his  claim,  she  should
         therefore have put him on notice."

17.  The respondent filed a response on 23 March 2017 noting that the  Upper
    Tribunal Judge had not dealt with the timeliness  issue  and  therefore
    there was no basis for considering the substantive issues.  In relation
    to the substantive points there had been changes and additions  to  the
    appellant's evidence on the day of the hearing and on the basis of  the
    evidence it was clearly open to the judge to make adverse findings  and
    to go behind what had previously been accepted by the respondent.   The
    appellant's representative should have been alive to the issues and  it
    was not incumbent on the judge to draw them to  the  attention  of  the
    appellant.

18.  There was a skeleton argument noting  that  the  judge  had  failed  to
    consider all the evidence in the round before making her findings - she
    had made her findings before any consideration had been  given  to  the
    expert country report at  paragraph  41.   Reference  was  made  to  SA
    (Somalia) [2006] EWCA Civ 1302 at paragraph 32 where the court referred
    to what has been known as the "Mibanga" point.  Medical evidence should
    not be treated as an add on and so it was argued by the representatives
    in this case the expert report should not be considered as an  add  on.
    In relation to  ground  2,  it  was  submitted  that  the  respondent's
    concessions were clear and unequivocal and were not formally  withdrawn
    during the hearing and as such the only matter at issue in  the  appeal
    was whether  the  appellant  would  be  able  to  internally  relocate.
    Reference was made to Kalidas (agreed facts  -  best  practice)  [2012]
    UKUT 00327 (IAC) at paragraph 35:

         "Judges, unless in exceptional circumstances, do  not  look  behind
         factual concessions.   Such  exceptional  circumstances  may  arise
         where the concession is partial or unclear and evidence develops in
         such a way that a judge considers that the extent  and  correctness
         of the concession must be revisited.  If so,  she  must  draw  that
         immediately to the attention of the representatives  so  that  they
         have an opportunity to ask further  questions,  lead  such  further
         evidence, and  make  such  further  submissions  as  required.   An
         adjournment may become necessary."

19.  In relation to the  issue  of  timeliness  reference  was  made  to  BO
    (extension of time for  appealing)  Nigeria  [2006]  UKAIT  00035.   In
    paragraph 16 of BO a delay by representatives  may  be  a  satisfactory
    explanation.

20.  Although the Upper Tribunal Judge had not expressly extended  time  the
    grant of permission would be conditional on time being extended.

21.  Counsel relied on the grounds.  In relation  to  ground  1  the  expert
    report had not been referred to until after the findings had been made.
     There had been no analysis or scrutiny of the expert's report  on  the
    question of relocation to Kabul or Jalalabad.  The expert had  given  a
    detailed analysis of the current situation  in  Kabul.   The  appellant
    would not be able to afford accommodation on such salary  as  he  might
    obtain from working.  This had  all  been  ignored  by  the  First-tier
    judge.

22.  Jalalabad was one hour's drive from his home area where the  respondent
    had accepted that he was  at  risk.   The  expert  had  said  that  the
    appellant could not relocate and would still be at risk.

23.  The expert report had simply been considered after the  findings  -  by
    analogy the Mibanga point was relevant.

24.  In relation to the concession issue, the judge had given no  indication
    that she was going to go behind the concession.

25.  Mr Tufan in relation to the timeliness issue noted that the  delay  had
    been the error of the representatives.  In relation to  the  concession
    he submitted that  the  judge  had  not  gone  behind  the  points  the
    respondent had expressly conceded in the  refusal  letter.   There  had
    been doubts about the appellant's story but the respondent had resolved
    these in favour of the appellant.

26.  In relation to the Mibanga point the judge had considered the  expert's
    report.  The European Court of Human Rights had considered a report  by
    the expert in H & B v United Kingdom 70073/1044539/11 and had stated in
    paragraph 108 as follows:

         "Finally, the Court is unable to attach weight to the report of  Dr
         Giustozzi submitted  by  the  first  applicant  (see  paragraph  71
         above).  The  Court  agrees  with   the   Government's   submission
         (summarised at paragraph 86 above) that the report appears to  have
         no relation to the individual facts of the first  applicant's  case
         as submitted both before the domestic authorities  and  this  Court
         and it therefore cannot assist him. "

27.  The appellant had completely changed his story  and  was  arguing  that
    the Taliban were after him so that they could turn him into  a  suicide
    bomber.

28.  In relation to the concession, there was no record  in  the  Presenting
    Officer's minute of the proceedings to a concession being withdrawn.

29.  The  Tribunal  had  found  in  paragraph  253  of  AK  (Article  15(c))
    Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00163 (IAC) that the appellant would not  be
    at risk on returning on his own without any family  support  to  Kabul.
    Assistance would be  available  to  returnees  and  there  was  a  very
    significant level of support  provided  -  see  paragraph  212  of  the
    country guidance.  The appellant  could  therefore  relocate  to  Kabul
    irrespective of whether  he  could  go  to  Jalalabad.   There  was  no
    material error of law.

30.  Mr Sellwood in reply submitted that the concession that had  been  made
    by the respondent was much broader than Mr Tufan had acknowledged.  The
    appellant's general credibility had not been criticised.

31.  The expert's report was personalised and tailored to the appellant  and
    was not generic.

32.  In relation to the blood feud point the appellant's  claim  had  always
    been that he would be killed by  the  Taliban  and  the  risk  had  not
    changed.  In the country guidance the appellant had an uncle  in  Kabul
    but  the  appellant  had  no  family  ties  to   assist   him   getting
    accommodation.  Paragraph 243 of the country  guidance  made  it  clear
    that "in every case there needs to be an enquiry into  the  applicant's
    individual circumstances; and what those circumstances  are  will  very
    often depend  on  the  nature  of  specific  findings  made  about  the
    credibility of an appellant in respect of such matters as whether  they
    have family ties in Kabul.  But here our premise concerns an  appellant
    with no specific risk characteristics and  someone  found  to  have  an
    uncle in Kabul... ".  The expert had found that there would be  a  risk
    to the appellant and that the appellant could be  tracked  down  -  see
    paragraphs 11-15 of the report.   Those  with  mental  health  problems
    might not be accepted.  The Taliban could extract  information  through
    the use of informers.  If there was a material error  of  law  a  fresh
    hearing would  be  required  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  it  was
    submitted.  Mr Tufan agreed.

33.  At the conclusion of the hearing I  reserved  my  decision.   I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the judge's decision  if  it  was
    materially flawed in law.

34.  A preliminary point concerns the issue  of  the  appeal  being  out  of
    time.

35.  This was a delay that was not  explained  in  the  application  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal  for  the  reason  that  the  representatives  were
    unaware that they were out of time.

36.  This was an application made during the  Christmas  period  where  days
    are identified as non working days.  The representatives understandably
    but mistakenly assumed that time would not run during these non working
    days.  In fact as was  now  acknowledged  the  time  is  calculated  by
    reference to calendar days.  The fact that they are non working days is
    not entirely irrelevant to the computation of time in this case because
    time did elapse on a non working day and  accordingly  would  not  have
    been deemed to have been out of time if it had  been  received  on  the
    next  working  day.   However  even  making  allowance  for  that   the
    application was out of time.

37.  In granting permission the Upper Tribunal Judge may be  taken  to  have
    extended time by implication as her reasons are prefixed with the words
    "including  any  decision  on  extending  time".    However,   if   the
    application to extend time  had  been  overlooked  then  the  grant  of
    permission would have been conditional on time being extended - see for
    example Samir (First-tier Tribunal permission to appeal:  time)  [2013]
    UKUT 00003 (IAC).  In that case it was a  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that was in issue.  The First-tier Tribunal had overlooked the
    application to extend time. In considering the question of an extension
    I am guided by the principles  recently  summarised  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in AM (Pakistan) &  Ors  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 180 at paragraph 3 per Elias LJ:

         "We have considered the relevant authorities including Mitchell  v
         News Group Newspapers Ltd. [2013] EWCA  Civ  1537; [2014]  1  WLR
         795; Denton v TH White Ltd. [2014] EWCA Civ 906; [2014]2 WLR 3926 R
         (Hysaj) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department [2014]  EWCA
         Civ 1633; [2015] 1 WLR 2472. These  cases  require  the  court  to
         consider  the  following  factors  in  three  stages:  first,   the
         seriousness and significance of the failure to comply; second,  the
         reasons  for  that  failure;  and  third,  to  evaluate   all   the
         circumstances of  the  case  in  order  to  deal  justly  with  the
         application. As the court pointed out in Hysaj, para.42, there  is
         no special rule for public authorities and no special  leniency  is
         shown to public bodies."

38.  The Secretary of State in AM (Pakistan)  had  relied  on  out  of  date
    material in the White Book. In extending time the Elias LJ stated: "The
    breach is relatively minor; I would not describe it as trivial, but  it
    is not very significant.  Second,  although  there  is  no  excuse  for
    failing to comply with the rule, and it was not suggested that reliance
    on an outdated text provided one, the explanation does  at  least  show
    that this was not a cavalier disregard of the provisions.  Third,  when
    taken in the context of a relatively minor breach, the circumstances in
    my view make it just to allow  the  extension  of  time.  There  is  no
    prejudice to the applicants in terms of their ability to respond to the
    appeal; and the case raised a point of real importance in public law."

     In this case the delay while not trivial was "not very significant"  in
    my view and the mistake was not a mistake by the appellant.  It  was  a
    mistake by the representatives. The mistake has been explained.  It was
    in my view understandable and not a "cavalier disregard" of the  rules.
    There is no real prejudice. The fact that the  grounds  submitted  have
    been found to be arguable and permission to  appeal  has  been  granted
    indicates that the grounds are not without merit.  Accordingly,  having
    regard to all relevant considerations it is appropriate to extend  time
    in this case.

39.  This was a case in which the appellant's general  credibility  was  not
    questioned by the respondent.  The judge focused on the narrow  factual
    concession but did not give weight to the fact that there was a general
    concession as to the appellant's credibility: in paragraph  21  of  the
    decision  letter  the  respondent  expressly   stated   "your   general
    credibility is upheld".  The  appellant's  statements  were  viewed  as
    coherent and plausible and the background to the appellant's claim  was
    set out - he had arrived as an unaccompanied asylum seeking child.

40.  Mr Tufan accepted that there was no minute on the Presenting  Officer's
    file to the effect that the concession was withdrawn  at  the  hearing.
    It  was  said  in  the  respondent's  response  that  the   appellant's
    representatives should have been alive  to  the  issues.   It  was  not
    incumbent on the judge to draw them to the attention of the appellant.

41.   With  respect,  if  the  respondent  intended  to  resile   from   the
    concessions of fact that had been so clearly  made  in  the  letter  of
    refusal the respondent should have drawn the matter to the attention of
    the parties and the judge.  The appellant's case had been  prepared  on
    the basis that his general credibility had been accepted and  no  doubt
    the expert's report would have been written on that basis.

42.  If the judge had had doubts about the appellant's general  credibility,
    and was of the view that the correctness of the concessions  should  be
    revisited, then, applying what was said in paragraph 35 of Kalidas  her
    concerns should have been drawn immediately to  the  attention  of  the
    representatives "so that they have an opportunity to ask  such  further
    questions, lead such further evidence and make such further submissions
    as required".

43.  In Kalidas the position was that  there  had  been  a  Case  Management
    Review hearing and there had been a  brief  note  about  what  had  was
    agreed.  This case is rather  different  in  that  the  respondent  had
    written a lengthy refusal letter including her considered reasoning  in
    respect of the concession.  In such a case it was in my  view  for  the
    Presenting Officer to make it clear to the judge at the hearing in what
    respect it was sought to withdraw that concession and for the judge  to
    take such steps as advised.  In any event the  judge  should  not  have
    gone behind a concession without alerting the parties.

44.  In relation to the expert report, of course it is a matter for a  judge
    as to what order he  or  she  deals  with  particular  aspects  of  the
    evidence.  However it is of note that the judge found  the  appellant's
    account to lack credibility before turning to  considering  the  report
    and the analogy with Mibanga is properly  made.   I  have  set  out  in
    detail the grounds of appeal in relation to the treatment of the report
    and I will not repeat them.  I do  not  find  expert's  report  can  be
    criticised by reference to what was said in the case of  H  &  B.   The
    expert's report was sufficiently tailored to the appellant in this case
    - it was not a generic report.

45.  I am very grateful to the assistance given  by  both  parties  in  this
    appeal.  They were of the view that if a  material  error  of  law  was
    identified the appeal should be remitted for a fresh hearing.  I  agree
    that that is the appropriate outcome in this case given the  degree  of
    fact-finding that is required.

47.  If the  appellant's  credibility  is  to  be  put  in  issue  then  the
    respondent must make this clear.  The appeal is remitted  for  a  fresh
    hearing before a different First-tier judge.

48.  The anonymity order continues.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
