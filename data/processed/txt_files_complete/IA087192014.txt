For the Appellant:     Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs A Stull of Lloyds Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appealed against a  decision  of  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Herwald promulgated on 9th July 2014.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I will refer to him as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a male Nigerian citizen  born  23rd  October  1983  who
    applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as the  spouse  of  a
    British citizen, Sarah Coker, to whom I shall refer as the Sponsor.

 4. The Claimant entered the United Kingdom on  20th  September  2009  with
    leave as a Tier 4  Student  valid  between  21st  July  2009  and  22nd
    September 2010.  He was subsequently granted further  leave  to  remain
    until 30th November 2013.

 5. The Claimant  met  the  Sponsor  in  April  2011  and  they  started  a
    relationship within  two  weeks  of  meeting.   They  married  on  26th
    November 2013 and  have  lived  together  since  their  marriage.   The
    Claimant's application for leave to remain was made  on  30th  November
    2013.

 6. The application was refused on 28th January 2014. It was  not  accepted
    that the  Claimant  satisfied  the  English  language  requirements  of
    Appendix FM.  It was accepted that he had produced an IELTS certificate
    with a score of 5.5, but this test was taken on 19th February 2011  and
    had expired.

 7. The Secretary of State considered section EX of Appendix  FM.   EX.1(a)
    was not applicable because the Claimant and  Sponsor  did  not  have  a
    child, and in relation to (b) the Secretary of  State  did  not  accept
    that there were insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing
    outside the United Kingdom.   It  was  acknowledged  that  the  Sponsor
    suffered with chronic pain, but the Secretary of State did  not  accept
    that this meant that the couple would be unable  to  live  together  in
    Nigeria.  Although relocating to Nigeria may cause a degree of hardship
    for the Sponsor, the Secretary of State did not accept that there  were
    any insurmountable obstacles that would prevent the  relationship  from
    continuing in Nigeria.

 8. In relation to the Claimant's private  life,  the  Secretary  of  State
    considered paragraph 276ADE and decided that the Claimant had no  right
    to remain in the United Kingdom in reliance upon that  paragraph.   The
    Secretary of  State  considered  whether  there  were  any  exceptional
    circumstances which would merit a grant of leave to remain outside  the
    Immigration Rules, and decided that there were not,  as  the  Sponsor's
    medical condition was not  a  barrier  to  family  life  continuing  in
    Nigeria.  There was no evidence to  show  that  the  Sponsor  would  be
    denied medical treatment outside the United Kingdom.

 9. The Secretary of  State  subsequently  issued  a  further  reasons  for
    refusal letter dated 26th June 2014 refusing the application for  leave
    to remain in relation to the financial  requirements  of  Appendix  FM.
    The Claimant had indicated that he earned an annual income of  �17,000,
    and it was therefore found that the annual income threshold of  �18,600
    was not met.  In addition the specified evidence required  by  Appendix
    FM-SE had not been submitted.

10. The Claimant's appeal was heard by Judge Herwald  (the  Judge)  on  2nd
    July 2014.  The judge allowed the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules,
    finding that although there were no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    couple living in Nigeria, there were insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    Sponsor travelling to Nigeria, because of her medical condition.

11. The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal, and the appeal
    came before me on 18th November 2014.  I  rejected  two  of  the  three
    Grounds of Appeal relied on by the Secretary of State, but  found  that
    the judge had erred in law by making findings in relation to the  issue
    of the Sponsor travelling to Nigeria, which were  not  sustainable  and
    not open to the judge to make on  the  evidence  before  him.   Medical
    evidence relied upon by the Sponsor did not support the conclusion that
    the Sponsor could not travel.  I also found that the judge  had  failed
    to give adequate  reasons  for  findings,  and  had  not  followed  the
    guidance in Budhathoki (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341.

12. Full details of the application for permission, the grant of permission
    by Judge Andrew, and my  reasons  for  finding  an  error  of  law  are
    contained in my decision dated 24th November 2014 which was promulgated
    on 28th November 2014.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set
    aside with no findings preserved.  The hearing was  adjourned  so  that
    further evidence could be given.

Remaking the Decision

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Preliminary Issues

13. I ascertained that I had received  all  documentation  upon  which  the
    parties intended to rely, and that each party had served the other with
    any documentation upon which reliance was to be placed.  I had received
    the Secretary of State's bundle with Annexes  A-B,  together  with  the
    supplementary refusal letter dated 26th June 2014.  I had also received
    the Notice of Appeal, and the Claimant's bundle which had  been  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, comprising  107  pages.   In  addition  I  had
    received the Personal Independent Payment decision dated 11th July 2014
    addressed to the Sponsor.  I  had  also  received  a  letter  from  the
    Sponsor's general practitioner Dr Bacall dated 4th February 2015.

14. Both the Claimant and Sponsor attended the hearing.  I  was  told  that
    the Sponsor would be called to give evidence.

15. Mrs Stull told me that the Claimant relied upon EX.1(b) of Appendix FM,
    and in the alternative Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.  I  was
    told that the Claimant had not been able  to  take  a  further  English
    language test because his passport had  expired  and  without  a  valid
    passport by way of identification, he was not allowed to undertake  the
    test.

Oral Evidence

16. I heard evidence from the Sponsor who  adopted  her  witness  statement
    dated 21st May 2014.  In summary the Sponsor  confirmed  that  she  was
    born in the United Kingdom and had always lived in  this  country.   In
    1993 she was involved in a helicopter crash while in the  Air  Training
    Corps in which the helicopter crashed into deep water.  The Sponsor was
    the only cadet to survive.

17. The Sponsor suffered broken vertebrae and a broken ankle and  burns  on
    20% of her body.  She spent four months in hospital.

18. She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and  suffers
    depression, anxiety, panic disorders and chronic  lower  back  and  hip
    pain.

19. The  Sponsor  is  under  the  supervision  of  a  trauma  therapist,  a
    physiotherapist and an orthopaedic consultant.   She  takes  medication
    for depression and anxiety disorder.

20. Her condition was aggravated by  being  involved  in  a  motor  vehicle
    accident in 2011.

21. The Sponsor is currently unable to work because  of  her  disabilities.
    The Sponsor does not believe it would be possible for her to travel  to
    Nigeria as she has a phobia of flying, and in addition  she  would  not
    have access to the medical support and treatment that she has  in  this
    country.  She is not able to  be  driven  for  distances  further  than
    fifteen minutes, and  any  jarring  causes  pain  in  her  spine.   The
    Sponsor's close family are in the United Kingdom.

The Secretary of State's Submissions

22. Mr Harrison had no oral submissions to make but relied upon the reasons
    for refusal letters.

23. I observed that the refusal letters did not make any reference  to  the
    Claimant  leaving  the  United  Kingdom  to  make  an  entry  clearance
    application from abroad.  Mr  Harrison  indicated  that  he  would  not
    submit that this would be appropriate or reasonable.  It  was  accepted
    that the Claimant would be able to pass the required  English  language
    test without any difficulty, and because the  Sponsor  now  receives  a
    Personal Independence Payment (PIP) the annual  income  requirement  of
    �18,600 would not have to be met.  Therefore if an application was made
    for leave to remain as a spouse, it was accepted that it would succeed.
     On that basis, Mr Harrison felt that he could not  make  a  submission
    that it would be appropriate for the Claimant  to  leave  and  make  an
    entry clearance application from abroad.

The Claimant's Submissions

24. Mrs Stull still relied upon her skeleton argument.  I was asked to find
    that the Sponsor's physical and mental health problems meant that there
    were insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in Nigeria.

25. I was asked to take into account both the  physical  difficulties  that
    the Sponsor faced, and also  the  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and
    anxiety from which she suffered.  I was  asked  to  find  that  medical
    evidence supported the contention that there  would  be  insurmountable
    obstacles to her living in Nigeria.

26. Mrs Stull accepted that the medical evidence did  not  prove  that  the
    Sponsor would be unable to  travel  but  I  was  asked  to  accept  the
    Sponsor's evidence on that issue.

27. I was asked to allow the appeal with  reference  to  EX.1(b).   If  the
    appeal was not allowed on that basis, I  was  asked  to  then  consider
    Article  8  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  and  to  find  that  the
    Claimant's removal,  in  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  would  be
    disproportionate.

28. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

29. I have taken into account all the evidence, both oral  and  documentary
    that has been placed before me, and taken into account the  submissions
    made by both representatives.  I have considered the  evidence  in  the
    round, and taken into  account  that  in  considering  the  Immigration
    Rules, such as EX.1(b) the burden of proof is on the Claimant, and  the
    standard of proof is a balance of probability.

30. It is accepted by both parties that I should consider EX.1(b)  which  I
    set out below, together with EX.2;

         "EX.1(b)

         The applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.

         EX.2

         For the purposes of paragraph  EX.1(b)  'insurmountable  obstacles'
         means the very significant difficulties which would be faced by the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

31. I note that EX.2 was introduced into the Immigration  Rules  after  the
    First-tier Tribunal decision had been made in this case, and I am  also
    aware that the PIP decision is dated 11th July 2014,  which  was  after
    the First-tier Tribunal hearing had taken place.

32. There is no dispute that the Claimant and Sponsor are in a genuine  and
    subsisting relationship and  that  they  are  married.   The  issue  is
    whether  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  their  family  life
    continuing outside the United Kingdom, in Nigeria, the country of which
    the Claimant is a citizen.

33. It is accepted on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  that  if  an
    application was made for leave to enter or remain as a spouse, it would
    succeed.

34. In assessing the issue of insurmountable obstacles,  I  note  that  the
    Sponsor was born in this country and has family members here.  She is a
    British citizen.  If she moved to Nigeria there would  be  considerable
    difficulties in language and culture but these alone do not  amount  to
    insurmountable obstacles.

35. The Sponsor married the Claimant in the knowledge that he did not  have
    indefinite leave to remain in this country.  The couple must have  been
    aware that his immigration status was precarious.

36. I am satisfied that the Sponsor has significant physical  disabilities.
    These are outlined in the report by Mr Doyle a  consultant  orthopaedic
    surgeon dated 13th  April  2014.   Mr  Doyle  refers  to  the  accident
    suffered in 1993, and comments that the Sponsor "is  probably  somewhat
    more affected than I thought she might be."  In page 2 of his report he
    comments that the Sponsor is "much less than mobile than I  was  hoping
    she would be at this stage."  He comments that some of  her  immobility
    is due to the effect of the fracture to her spine and  the  facture  to
    her ankle, and refers also to her depression and weight gain.

37. Mr Doyle notes that the Sponsor has to have the help of the Claimant to
    get in and out of a motor vehicle, and cannot get out  of  bed  without
    the Claimant's help.  The Claimant is also described as having to carry
    her shopping.  Mr Doyle  concludes  that  the  Sponsor  is  "relatively
    disabled due to the effects of  the  injuries  she  sustained  while  a
    member of the Air Training Corps."

38. In relation to the Sponsor's mental health, I have seen a  report  from
    Rowene Newton, a group psychotherapist  with  Greater  Manchester  West
    NHS.  She also refers to the accident in 1993  and  confirms  that  the
    Sponsor was first referred in November 2012 having previously  been  in
    treatment at Salford Primary Care Psychology Service  between  November
    2011 and March 2012.

39. The Sponsor is described as having  suffered  a  significant  traumatic
    situation having been trapped under water in a helicopter  crash.   She
    suffered symptoms of post-traumatic  stress  disorder  for  many  years
    until she sought help.  The Sponsor is described as lacking confidence,
    lacking self-esteem, and with chronic depression, chronic  anxiety  and
    significant difficulties in her day-to-day functioning.  Her  treatment
    began  in  October  2013  and  is   expected   to   be   completed   in
    January/February 2016.

40. The conclusion is that  if  the  Sponsor  is  unable  to  complete  her
    psychotherapy  it  would  pose  a  risk  to  her  mental  health,   her
    psychological functioning, and she could become a risk  to  herself  in
    terms of self-harm or suicidal acts.

41. I have also read a letter dated 24th March 2014 from Anthony  Schofield
    a mental health advocate with Mind  in  Salford,  confirming  that  the
    Sponsor has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic
    depression, anxiety and panic disorder.

42. The PIP decision dated 11th July 2014 confirmed the Sponsor is entitled
    to the  Daily  Living  component,  and  the  Mobility  component.   The
    decision indicates the Sponsor needs help to prepare or cook a meal and
    that she needs prompting to manage her medication, and that  she  needs
    assistance in order to bath, toilet and dress.  It is accepted that due
    to her anxiety she needs prompting to be  able  to  engage  with  other
    people and it was accepted that she needed  prompting  to  be  able  to
    undertake any journey to avoid psychological distress.  It was accepted
    that the Sponsor could stand and then move more than 50 metres, but  no
    more than 200 metres aided or unaided.

43. I find that the Sponsor does have very significant physical and  mental
    disabilities for  which  she  is  currently  receiving  medication  and
    treatment.

44. I conclude that the cumulative effect of  this  evidence  proves  on  a
    balance  of  probabilities  that  the  Sponsor  would  experience  very
    significant difficulties if she lived in Nigeria because her  treatment
    would be interrupted, and she would not receive  the  income  that  she
    currently receives to assist her  in  dealing  with  her  disabilities.
    There may be medical facilities available in Nigeria, but  these  would
    be provided at a cost, and the medical facilities would not be  at  the
    same level as the Sponsor currently receives in the United Kingdom.   I
    find that it is probable that  the  Claimant  would  be  able  to  find
    employment in Nigeria which would be  able  to  provide  some  form  of
    accommodation,  but  given   the   Sponsor's   medical   problems   and
    difficulties, I am not satisfied either that the accommodation would be
    suitable  for  her,  or  that  suitable  medical  treatment  would   be
    available.  I find that the very significant difficulties  which  would
    be experienced by the Sponsor, would entail very serious  hardship  for
    her.

45. I therefore conclude that this appeal should be allowed with  reference
    to EX.1(b).  If the appeal was allowed on this basis, it was  indicated
    on behalf of the Claimant that it would not be necessary for me  to  go
    on and consider Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules, and  therefore
    I do not do so.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and  was
set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules in relation to EX.1(b)  of
Appendix FM.

No anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no application for anonymity and I see no need to make an anonymity order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The appeal has been allowed and I therefore considered  whether  to  make  a
fee award.  I conclude that the appeal has been allowed  due  to  additional
evidence provided to the Tribunal, which was not  provided  to  the  initial
decision maker.  I therefore conclude that it is not appropriate to  make  a
fee award.
