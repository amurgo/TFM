Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Appiah, instructed by Vine Court Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant, a Pakistani citizen born on 1 April 1979, arrived in
         the UK on 28 July 2012 as a Tier 4 student. The appellant has  made
         a number of applications for residence card as the spouse of  a  EU
         National  exercising  treaty  rights.  Each  application  has  been
         refused because  the  respondent  considers  that  the  appellant's
         marriage to be one  of  convenience.  An  application  made  on  25
         October 2014 was refused on the 2 February 2015 and his appeal  was
         heard by the First-tier Tribunal on  25  August  2015.  The  appeal
         against the refusal of  a  residence  card  it  was  dismissed  for
         reasons set  out  in  a  decision,  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Robison, promulgated on 17 September 2015.

      2. First-tier Tribunal judge Robison found  that  the  inconsistencies
         identified in the extracts from the marriage interview set  out  in
         the reasons for refusal letter were of such number and nature  that
         he was satisfied the respondent had raised a  reasonable  suspicion
         on the evidence that on the  balance  of  probabilities  it  was  a
         marriage  of  convenience  [25].  The  First-tier  Tribunal   judge
         identified evidence relied on by the appellant that pointed to  the
         marriage being a genuine marriage, accepted that out of the 200  or
         so questions there were a large number of consistencies as well  as
         the inconsistencies highlighted in  the  refusal  letter  but  also
         identified discrepancies in the oral evidence, hesitancy  in  their
         answers and a lack of clarity in  the  explanations  given  by  the
         appellant and sponsor in respect of some issues  [28].  The  First-
         tier Tribunal judge found the evidence relating to the transfer  of
         large deposits  into  the  sponsor's  bank  account  of  particular
         significance [30]. The First-tier  Tribunal  judge  concluded  that
         taking account of all the evidence before him he was  satisfied  it
         was more probable than not that it was a marriage of convenience.

      3. The appellant applied again on 5th April 2016 for a residence  card
         on the basis of his marriage. That application was again refused by
         the respondent on 3rd October 2016 because the Secretary  of  State
         took the view that the marriage was a marriage of convenience.  The
         appeal against that decision was dismissed by a First-tier Tribunal
         judge Nash for the reasons set out in a decision promulgated on  17
         April 2018.

      4. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that  the
         First-tier Tribunal judge had failed to place  adequate  weight  on
         his spouse's pregnancy and secondly that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         judge had not had a sight of the marriage interview upon which  the
         2015 decision was reached and this was procedurally unfair.

      5. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Upper Tribunal  judge
         Martin in the First-tier  Tribunal  but  granted  by  deputy  Upper
         Tribunal judge Chapman in the Upper Tribunal.

      6. Mr Appiah confirmed before me that he relied upon these two grounds
         which he submitted  identified  an  error  of  law  such  that  the
         decision of the First-tier Tribunal  should  be  set  aside  to  be
         remade. He accepted that the starting point for First-tier Tribunal
         judge Nash was the  findings  made  by  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
         Robison, as per Devaseelan [2003] Imm AR 1.

         Interview record

      7. The interview record has not been produced  and  was  not  produced
         before the First-tier Tribunal in 2015 or the  First-tier  Tribunal
         in 2018. It seems that  the  appellant  sought  disclosure  of  the
         interview record prior to  the  August  2015  hearing  but  at  the
         hearing, when a further request was made, it was apparent  that  it
         could not be produced for a few weeks. His legal representative  at
         that time did not seek an adjournment; she confirmed to the  First-
         tier Tribunal judge that she was "happy to  go  ahead  without  the
         transcript" [3].

      8. Mr Shah, who represented the appellant before  First-tier  Tribunal
         judge Nash (the 2018 decision), did  not  seek  an  adjournment  to
         enable the interview record to be produced. There is no record that
         he made submissions to the effect that the extract of the interview
         record as it appeared in the decision letter that was  the  subject
         of the appeal in 2015 was inaccurate; nor was  there  a  submission
         that the evidence of the appellant and  his  spouse  to  First-tier
         Tribunal judge Robison did not deal with the  inconsistencies  that
         were raised by the respondent in that refusal letter.  Although  Mr
         Shah  is  recorded  as  relying  on  Miah   (interviewer   comments
         disclosure fairness) [2014] UKUT 00515, it is not recorded what the
         basis of those submissions were. The  skeleton  argument  that  was
         relied upon in the 2018 First-tier Tribunal hearing does  not  take
         issue with the extracts in the refusal letter that were before  the
         First-tier Tribunal in the 2015 decision. The skeleton says  little
         more than that the Home Office had failed to show  which  questions
         and answers had led the Home Office to reach the conclusion it did.



      9. Mr Appiah submitted that there was an underlying unfairness because
         the Secretary of State had failed to produce the  interview  record
         even  though  at  the  first  hearing  in  2015   the   appellant's
         representative had said she was content to proceed in its  absence;
         and in the 2018 hearing no application was made for  an  order  for
         disclosure or for an adjournment to obtain  disclosure.  Whilst  in
         general it is correct that  underlying  fairness  usually  requires
         disclosure of interview records, in this case  two  representatives
         at two separate hearings have  neither  sought  an  adjournment  or
         expressed  an  objection  to  proceeding  in  the  absence  of  the
         interview record. Furthermore, the findings in  the  2015  decision
         were considered by First-tier Tribunal  judge  Nash  in  accordance
         with the principles of Devaseelan. First-tier Tribunal  judge  Nash
         considered the evidence both oral and documentary as it applied  at
         the time of the appellant's and his spouse's marriage. No objection
         has been raised to his  treatment  of  that  evidence  -  save  the
         evidence of pregnancy as to which  see  below.  The  evidence  with
         regard  to  the  interview  record  was  considered  by  First-tier
         Tribunal judge Robertson in 2015 and the  findings  have  not  been
         overturned. The appellant has not put forward any new evidence that
         could begin to undermine the findings with regard to the  interview
         record. In any event an attempt  to  raise  a  procedural  fairness
         point some 3 ï¿½ years after a  hearing  has  taken  place  when  the
         representative at that hearing specifically did not object and at a
         hearing in 2018 when there was again no objection, is of no merit.

     10. There is no error of law by First-tier Tribunal judge Nash  failing
         to have regard to a document which was not before him, for which no
         application for it to be before him had been  made,  for  which  no
         application for an adjournment to enable it to be  before  him  had
         been made and where the  appellant's  representative  had  said  at
         hearing where the interview was in question, that she was happy  to
         proceed in its absence.

         Pregnancy

     11. First-tier Tribunal judge Nash  took  account  of  the  appellant's
         spouse's pregnancy and miscarriage. He notes  the  doctor's  report
         that the appellant is supportive and that he is concerned about his
         spouse's health. The judge found that the evidence as to  pregnancy
         and the GP letter work insufficient for him to revisit the decision
         of First-tier Tribunal judge Robison.

     12. It is important  to  remember  that  the  issue  before  First-tier
         Tribunal  judge  Nash  is  not  whether  there  is  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship/marriage  but  whether  or  not  it  was  a
         marriage of convenience at the date on which it was entered into. A
         marriage may be  entered  into  as  a  matter  of  convenience  and
         subsequently become a  close,  loving,  supportive  and  subsisting
         marriage but that does not mean that  it  was  not  a  marriage  of
         convenience at its instigation. The fact of a later  pregnancy  may
         affect that assessment but not necessarily so. Although it  may  be
         that paragraphs 62 and  63  of  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  Nash's
         decision identify issues which  can  be  read  as  undermining  the
         evidence of pregnancy,  the  conclusion  of  Judge  Nash  that  the
         evidence overall that was before him was inadequate to  render  the
         decision of the respondent to refuse a residence card on the  basis
         that the marriage was the marriage of convenience was  infected  by
         error of law.

     13. There is no error of law in the  decision  by  First-tier  Tribunal
         judge Nash such as to set aside his decision.

    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

    I do not set  aside  the  decision;  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal stands.
