Officer

For the respondent:    Mr David Sellwood, Counsel instructed by Duncan
Lewis Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS



1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against  the  decision  of
   the First-tier Tribunal  to  allow  the  claimant's  appeal  against  her
   decision  to  cease  refugee  status  pursuant  to  section  72  of   the
   Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (as  amended)  and  Article
   1C(5) of the Refugee  Convention,  alternatively  that  the  claimant  is
   excluded from refugee status pursuant  to  Articles  32  and  33  of  the
   Refugee Convention, and to make a deportation  order  against  him  as  a
   foreign  criminal  pursuant  to  sections  32  and  33  of  the  Borders,
   Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

2. The claimant  is  a  citizen  of  Somalia.  The  index  offence  was  his
   conviction for robbery on 24 February 2014, for which he was sentenced to
   5 years' imprisonment.   He  remains  on  licence  in  relation  to  that
   sentence. He was served with  notification  of  intention  to  cease  his
   refugee status on 18 January 2016. On 10 May 2016, the Secretary of State
   signed a deportation order to return  the  claimant  to  his  country  of
   origin, Somalia.

The legal framework

3. The claimant is  subject  to  automatic  deportation  by  reason  of  the
   provisions of sections 32 and 33 of the UK Borders Act 2007.  Section  32
   defines 'foreign criminal' as a person who is not a British citizen,  who
   is convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and in  addition,  that
   his offending  meets  either  Condition  1  (sentenced  to  a  period  of
   imprisonment of at least 12 months) or Condition 2, that the  offence  is
   one of those specified as a serious criminal  offence  by  order  of  the
   Secretary of State under section 72(4)(a) of the 2002 Act and the  person
   is sentenced to a period of imprisonment.

4. If either Condition is met, the person is  a  foreign  criminal  and  the
   statute creates  an  statutory  presumption  (section  32(4))  that  such
   deportation order is conducive to the public good. The Secretary of State
   is required to make a deportation order in respect of a foreign criminal,
   unless one of the Exceptions in section 33 is applicable, or the  foreign
   criminal is outside the United Kingdom, or section 34(4) applies  (making
   a fresh deportation decision under section 32(5)).

5. The statutory presumption that deportation is  conducive  to  the  public
   good ceases to apply  (positively  or  negatively)  if  an  Exception  is
   applicable.  The relevant exception in  section  33  in  this  appeal  is
   Exception 1:

         "33. ...(2)   Exception 1 is where removal of the foreign  criminal
         in pursuance of the deportation order would breach -
             (a)  A person's Convention rights; or
             (b)   The  United  Kingdom's  obligations  under  the  Refugee
             Convention. ...


         (7)  The application of an exception -
             (a)  Does not prevent the making of a deportation order;
             (b)  Results in it being assumed neither that  deportation  of
             the person concerned is conducive to the public good, nor that
             it is not conducive to the public good."

6. Where the Secretary of State has certified her decision under section  72
   of the 2002 Act, section 72(1) tells the Court or  Tribunal  how  Article
   33(2) of the Refugee Convention is to be applied. Section 72(10)  of  the
   2002 Act requires the Tribunal to begin its consideration of  the  appeal
   with consideration of the section 72 certificate.  The claimant will have
   appealed under section 82, 83, 83A or 101 of the Nationality, Immigration
   and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended), wholly or partly on the ground that  to
   remove him from, or to require him to leave  the  United  Kingdom,  would
   breach the United Kingdom's Refugee Convention obligations  (see  section
   72(9)(a)).

7. A section 72 certificate has the  effect  of  raising  a  dual  statutory
   presumption: first, that the claimant  has  been  convicted  on  a  final
   judgment  of  a  'particularly  serious  crime'  and  second,   that   he
   'constitutes a danger to  the  community'.   In  the  case  of  a  person
   convicted in  the  United  Kingdom,  section  72(2)  provides  that  both
   presumptions come into effect where the  individual  is  sentenced  to  a
   period of imprisonment of at least 2 years.

8. Both presumptions may be rebutted by appropriate evidence, as set out  in
   section 72(6)  and  EN  (Serbia)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
   Department & Anor [2009] EWCA Civ 630.

9. If both presumptions are not rebutted, then section 72(10)(b) of the  Act
   requires the Tribunal to dismiss the appeal in so far as it relies on the
   Refugee Convention ground.  No presumptions are  raised  in  relation  to
   human rights.

10. I am guided in  my  approach  to  the  section  72  certificate  by  the
   decision of the Upper Tribunal in Mugwagwa  (s.72  -  applying  statutory
   presumptions) Zimbabwe  [2011]  UKUT  338  (IAC).   Paragraph  1  of  the
   judicial headnote to that decision is as follows:

         "1. The First-tier Tribunal (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  is
         required to apply of its own motion the statutory  presumptions  in
         s.72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  to  the
         effect that Art 33(2) of the Refugee Convention  will  not  prevent
         refoulement of a refugee where the  factual  underpinning  for  the
         application of s.72 is present even if the Secretary of  State  has
         not relied upon Art 33(2) and s.72."

11. The Upper Tribunal in Mugwagwa explained the effect of  the  section  72
   certificate as follows:

         "23.        Section 72(2) creates statutory presumptions  that  the
         requirements of Art 33(2)  are  met  and,  as  a  consequence,  the
         prohibition against refoulement will not apply.  Section 72  is  in
         mandatory  terms:  "[a]  person  shall  be  presumed...".   In  our
         judgment, where s.72(2) or any of the  other  statutory  provisions
         creating presumptions in s.72 applies, the Tribunal is under a duty
         to apply s.72 to the individual in the appeal. Given the evidential
         base provided by these presumptions, subject to rebuttal, Art 33(2)
         will apply in such circumstances so that that a  refugee's  removal
         will not be a breach of the Refugee  Convention.   Of  course,  the
         individual will, whilst he fulfils the definition in Art 1  of  the
         Refugee  Convention,  still  have  the  status  of  a  refugee   in
         international law; and he cannot be removed  from  the  UK  to  his
         country of nationality as that would inevitably infringe Art  3  of
         the ECHR.  However, given the terms of the 2002 and 2007 Acts,  his
         appeal relying on 'asylum' or 'refugee' grounds cannot succeed."

12. That is the legal  framework  against  which  this  appeal  fell  to  be
   analysed.

Background

13. The claimant was born in  Somalia  in  1990  and  is  a  member  of  the
   minority Midgan clan.  He lived in  Mogadishu,  Somalia's  capital  city,
   with his parents, brother and sisters.  The whole family left Somalia  in
   early 1992, the claimant then aged just 2.  The family went first to  the
   Yemen, where they were recognised as refugees by  the  Yemeni  Government
   and UNHCR.  In July 2003, the family entered  the  United  Kingdom  under
   UNHCR's 10-year resettlement program and were granted indefinite leave to
   remain in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2003.   All  of  the  claimant's
   family members apart from him are now naturalised British citizens.

14. The claimant has a lengthy criminal history: between August  2009,  when
   he was 19 and February 2014, when he was 24, he received 8 convictions on
   4 occasions.  The first was an offence against the person (for  which  he
   received a caution).  There followed convictions  for  domestic  burglary
   with intent to steal, handling  stolen  goods,  theft  from  the  person,
   attempted robbery, two counts of robbery, one offence of  common  assault
   and one of failing to surrender to custody, all of which were dealt  with
   by community orders or detention in a Young Offenders Institution.

15. On 24 February 2014, the claimant was  convicted,  with  a  younger  co-
   defendant, for a robbery which took  place  on  11  October  2013.   Both
   defendants were sentenced to  5  years'  imprisonment,  the  claimant  in
   prison and his younger co-defendant in  a  Youth  Offenders  Institution.
   The Judge's sentencing remarks for the two defendants were as follows:

         "Your previous convictions both provide significant aggravation  of
         your offending.  You are both guilty of many  robberies  committed.
         ...You [the claimant] last robbery [age] 20, you are now  aged  24,
         23 at the time of the offence.

         You have received a number of disposals over the years  for  these.
         It is clear that neither of you has learnt anything at all.  I  see
         no significant mitigation in either  of  your  cases.   ...  I  see
         nothing that offends the principle of totality in this  case  in  a
         correct calculation of the appropriate sentence.

         This offence in the case of both of you is so serious that  neither
         a community penalty nor a fine  can  be  justified  and  the  least
         sentence I can impose upon you is one of 5 years. ..."

16. The Secretary of State noted that  the  claimant  had  ties  within  the
   Somali community in the United Kingdom and that he had received a British
   education  and  obtained  qualifications  here  (GCSEs,  NVQ   and   BTEC
   Nationals).  In addition, the claimant had studied business management at
   college, all of which would  assist  him  on  return  to  Somalia.    The
   claimant had asserted that he suffered depression: the Secretary of State
   noted that there were mental health  services  available  in  Somalia  to
   assist him.

Cessation of refugee status

17. The Secretary of State informed the claimant of her intention  to  cease
   his refugee status, having regard  to  the  change  of  circumstances  in
   Somalia.  The Secretary of State invited UNHCR to comment on the proposed
   cessation. In a letter dated 1 March 2016, UNHCR expressed concern as  to
   whether it was appropriate for refugee cessation to  be  triggered  by  a
   criminal  conviction  and  considered  that  the  Secretary  of   State's
   assessment of circumstances  in  Mogadishu  and  in  Somalia  was  overly
   optimistic.  UNHCR's letter referred to the Human Rights Watch report for
   2013, the UN Commissioner  for  Refugees  Report  of  January  2014;  the
   LandInfo Country Information Centre report of March 2014;  the  Norwegian
   Organisation for Asylum  Seekers  report  of  April  2014,  and  the  MOJ
   decision by the Upper Tribunal.

18. The  Secretary  of  State  considered  the  UNHCR  representations,  but
   nevertheless  concluded  that  there  was   a   significant   change   in
   circumstances which  could  justify  the  claimant's  return  to  Somalia
   without a risk of persecution or serious harm.   Her cessation  decision,
   contained in the deportation decision letter, was  made  under  paragraph
   338A and 339A(v)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  HC395  (as  amended)  with
   reference to Article 1C(5) of the Refugee Convention.

19. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

20. The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not deal first  with  the  section  72
   presumption.  His conclusions and reasons begin with section 117C of  the
   2002 Act and Article 8 ECHR.  The Judge was satisfied that  the  claimant
   was a 'foreign criminal' as defined in section 32 of the  2007  Act,  but
   held that the claimant could bring himself within Exception 1 in  section
   33 and that there was no presumption that his removal was for the  public
   good.

21.  At  [39],  the  Judge  summarised  the  effect  of   the   section   72
   presumptions.  He held that the claimant had rebutted  both  presumptions
   and that the section 72 certificate 'was not justified'.   At  [40],  the
   Judge said that 'the question of whether or  not  it  is  a  particularly
   serious crime is relevant  to  whether  or  not  humanitarian  protection
   should be withdrawn or refused'.  There are  no  further  findings  about
   humanitarian protection in the First-tier Tribunal decision.

22. The Tribunal then considered  cessation.   It  did  so  without  express
   reference to the UNHCR letter,  and  discounted  a  country  report  from
   Professor Aguilar on the basis that it 'does not  displace  the  previous
   findings of MOJ'.  The First-tier Tribunal found as a fact that on return



         "52. ...the [claimant] will be in  a  situation  with  no  clan  or
         family support and would not be  in  receipt  of  remittances  from
         abroad, and would have no real prospects of securing  access  to  a
         livelihood on return and that would mean that his conditions  could
         well  fall  below  that  which  is  exceptional   in   humanitarian
         protection terms."

23. The Judge found that it had not been open to the Secretary of  State  to
   conclude that the cessation provisions were made out.  He considered  the
   Refugee Convention risk to amount to 'compelling circumstances as to  why
   [the claimant] should not be returned to Somalia', and allowed the appeal
   on refugee status grounds. The  First-tier  Tribunal  made  no  anonymity
   direction.

24. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Grounds of appeal

25. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal were that  it  had  not  been
   open to the First-tier Tribunal to find that  the  'particularly  serious
   crime' presumption was rebutted.   She relied on the sentencing  remarks,
   and the length of  the  sentence  (5  years).   The  Secretary  of  State
   submitted that the decision that the index offence did not  amount  to  a
   particularly serious crime was perverse and/or  irrational,  particularly
   in view of the sentencing remarks.

26. The Secretary of State also challenged the finding that the  presumption
   that the claimant posed a danger to the community of the  United  Kingdom
   (section 72(2)) had been rebutted.  She argued that  the  Judge  had  not
   given sufficient weight  to  evidence  in  the  OASys  reports  that  the
   claimant still posed a  medium  risk  of  harm,  albeit  a  low  risk  of
   reoffending.

27. The Secretary of State argued  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  not
   approached properly the country guidance in MOJ.  She did  not  challenge
   any of the factual findings made by the  First-tier  Tribunal  about  the
   claimant's likely circumstances on return  to  Mogadishu.   Nor  did  she
   challenge the treatment of  humanitarian  protection  by  the  First-tier
   Tribunal at [40].

28. The Secretary of State contended that the Article 8 ECHR  findings  made
   by the First-tier Tribunal were incapable of amounting to very compelling
   circumstances outside the Rules, for which  leave  to  remain  should  be
   given, as  the  compelling  circumstances  reasoning  in  the  First-tier
   Tribunal's decision did not appear to relate to  the  claimant's  private
   and family life.

Permission to appeal

29. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  on  all  grounds.   The  grant  of
   permission to appeal identifies the following arguable errors of law:

           i) That the Judge misdirected himself in  law  when  considering
              exclusion under section 72 of the 2002 Act;

          ii) That the Judge erred in fact and law,  in  finding  that  the
              index offence was not a 'particularly serious crime'  in  the
              section 72 sense;

         iii) That the Judge erred in fact in assessing that  the  claimant
              no longer posed a  danger  to  society,  as  required  for  a
              section 72 certificate;

          iv) That the First-tier Tribunal failed to identify  the  Refugee
              Convention reason 'and consequently erred in his approach  to
              Article 8 [ECHR]'; and

           v) That the findings as to  whether  the  index  offence  was  a
              'particularly serious crime' were perverse and/or irrational.

Rule 24 Reply

30. Notice that permission had been granted was sent to both  parties  on  9
   August 2017.  The claimant  and  his  representatives  were  entitled  to
   submit a Rule 24 Reply within 1 month of that date, that is to say, by  9
   September 2017.  No Rule 24 Reply was received  within  that  period  and
   there is no application to extend time.

31. At the hearing, Mr Sellwood handed me  a  skeleton  argument  which,  he
   said, should also be treated as his  Rule  24  Reply.   The  document  in
   question does not comply with rule 24(3) and I treat this document  as  a
   skeleton argument, not a Reply.

32. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

33. For the Secretary of State, Mr Bramble relied on his grounds of  appeal.
   The sentencing remarks had been  truncated  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   decision, such that they did not properly reflect the serious view  taken
   by the sentencing judge.   Although  no  weapon  had  been  used  in  the
   robbery, the claimant and his co-defendant had  used  force  at  a  level
   which the Judge described as 'not insignificant'.   At [40],  the  First-
   tier Tribunal had considered humanitarian protection,  but  if  exclusion
   applied, it would apply both to refugee protection  and  to  humanitarian
   protection.

34. The First-tier Tribunal's findings on Article 3 and Article 8 ECHR  were
   sweeping and unsound.  The Judge had given  insufficient  weight  to  the
   country evidence of Professor Aguilar, and also to the  risk  factors  at
   (x) and (xi) in MOJ.  The claimant was a  young  man,  not  a  vulnerable
   woman, and would be able to re-establish himself in Somalia on return.

35. The First-tier Tribunal's findings of fact on the  likely  circumstances
   of the claimant's return to Mogadishu were not specifically mentioned  in
   the grounds of appeal, but Mr Bramble argued that as the sentence imposed
   was  more  than  4  years,  the  Judge's  findings  on  very   compelling
   circumstances failed properly to apply either paragraph  398  or  section
   117C(6) and could not stand.

36. For the claimant, Mr Sellwood  relied  on  his  skeleton  argument.   In
   relation to the 'particularly serious  crime'  and  'danger  to  society'
   elements of the section 72 test, he seeks there to rebut  the  allegation
   that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  approach  was  based  on  a   material
   misdirection in law.  Mr Sellwood argued that the  Secretary  of  State's
   challenge was a perversity/rationality challenge, not a  misdirection  in
   law.  Mr Sellwood did not seek to argue that if  the  Refugee  Convention
   claim failed, the  claimant  was  not  also  excluded  from  humanitarian
   protection.  That was not in issue before me at the hearing.

37. Mr Sellwood relied on IH  (section  72:  'particularly  serious  crime')
   Eritrea [2009] UKAIT 0012 at [14], [75] and [76] and  on  EN  (Serbia)  v
   Secretary of State for the Home Department and Another  [2009]  EWCA  Civ
   630 at [45].  He contended that the First-tier Tribunal's decision  dealt
   properly with  both  assessments,  taking  into  account  the  claimant's
   history, the nature and circumstances of the offence, the OASys  reports,
   and the claimant's  evidence  and  experiences  while  imprisoned,  which
   showed at least some insight into the consequences of his actions.

38. He argued that the Secretary of State's  reliance  on  MA  (Pakistan)  v
   Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  163  was
   erroneous: the appellant in MA had not faced up to his criminal  offences
   (see [19] in the judgment of Lord Justice Elias, giving the  judgment  of
   the Court)  and  the  offences  in  question  were  grave  indeed  (money
   laundering and trafficking of Class A drugs).  I note that  the  sentence
   imposed on MA was 3 years' imprisonment, not 5 years, as here.

39. As regards  the  question  of  cessation,  Mr  Sellwood  contended  that
   refugee status could not be reviewed or annulled,  save  where  the  most
   substantial and clear  grounds  exist,  and  that  a  change  in  country
   circumstances  must  be  significant  and  non-temporary  (see  Salahadin
   Abdulla (Area of Freedom, Security and Justice)  [2010]  EUECJ  C-175/08,
   [2011] QB 46).  The Secretary of State and/or the Tribunal  was  required
   to consider whether there were any other grounds on which the  individual
   had a fear of persecution on return, and the decision was therefore fact-
   specific at the date of decision or hearing.  The Secretary of State  had
   given insufficient weight to the UNHCR letter  in  deciding  whether  the
   threshold of significant and non-temporary  change  of  circumstances  in
   Somalia was reached. Mr Sellwood contended that it had been open  to  the
   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  to  find  as  a  fact  that  the   cessation
   certificate was unlawful.

40. As regards Article 8  ECHR,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  been
   entitled to conclude, as he  had,  that  the  claimant  could  show  very
   compelling circumstances, over and above those outlined in  Exceptions  1
   and 2 in section 117C(4) and 117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration  and
   Asylum Act 2002 (as amended) and paragraph 398 of the Rules, to  outweigh
   the public interest in  deportation.   The  skeleton  argument  does  not
   identify what those were,  and  the  compelling  circumstances  reasoning
   relied upon is that at [54] in the decision.

41. Finally, Mr Sellwood argued that  the  standard  for  perversity  and/or
   irrationality in relation to the finding that the index offence was not a
   'particularly serious crime' was not met, having regard to the  reasoning
   in the First-tier Tribunal decision.

42. In his oral submissions, Mr Sellwood reminded the Tribunal that  section
   72 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as  amended)
   reflected Article  33  of  the  Refugee  Convention,  which  defines  the
   circumstances in which a refugee  can  be  refouled  to  the  country  of
   origin.  The threshold is high, because of the grave ramifications of any
   error.

43. Mr Sellwood observed that  the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  were  a
   disagreement with the outcome of the appeal, rather than identifying  any
   arguably material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal decision.   The
   Secretary of State in her grounds had not challenged the findings of fact
   or credibility in the grounds of appeal, and it was not open to her to do
   so now.

44. It had been open to the Judge to find, for the  reasons  he  gave,  that
   the claimant was no longer a danger to the community,  having  regard  to
   the later of the two OASys reports before him.  The risk  of  destitution
   on return by reason of the lack of clan or family support was capable, by
   itself, of meeting the Article 3 ECHR or Article 15(c) standard and  even
   if it was right that the difficulties experienced  in  Mogadishu  by  the
   Midgan were now at the level  of  discrimination,  not  persecution,  the
   claimant  had  been  entitled  to  succeed  on  the  basis  of  potential
   destitution.  That amounted to  very  compelling  grounds  under  section
   117C(6) and paragraph 398; in fact, no other conclusion was open  to  the
   First-tier Tribunal on the evidence before it.

Discussion

The section 72 certificate

45. I consider first, as section 72(10)(a) requires, whether  the  Secretary
   of State's challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's section 72 decision  is
   sound.  This claimant was sentenced to 5 years and so  both  presumptions
   are  raised  in  relation  the  Refugee  Convention  ground,  subject  to
   rebuttal.

46. The Secretary of State challenged the First-tier Tribunal's  section  72
   decision both on the basis  that  it  was  not  open  to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge to find that the crime in question was  not  'particularly
   serious', and on the basis that the Judge was not entitled to  find  that
   the claimant did not pose a  danger  to  society.   Her  challenge  is  a
   challenge to the First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings on rebuttal.



'Particularly serious crime' presumption

47. The Judge's finding that the index offence of robbery,  which  attracted
   a sentence of 5 years imprisonment, did  not  constitute  a  particularly
   serious crime is unsustainable, having regard to the  sentencing  Judge's
   remarks, which are not properly represented in the summary at  [44].   It
   was not a question of aggravating features making  the  offence  serious.
   The sentencing judge said this:

    "This offence in the case of both of you is so serious that  neither  a
    community penalty nor a fine can be justified and the least sentence  I
    can impose upon you is one of 5 years."

   The finding made in the First-tier Tribunal decision was contrary to  the
   evidence before the Judge and cannot stand (see R (Iran) v  Secretary  of
   State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982 at [90]).



'Danger to the community' presumption

48. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered also that the  presumption  was
   rebutted in relation to whether the claimant constituted a danger to  the
   community.  He took into account the claimant's relative youth (24  years
   old), that he had 'gone off the rails in his late teens' and that  'there
   was clearly a period when he was operating without any proper restraint'.
    The claimant had found it difficult to assimilate into the  English  way
   of life, having arrived here as a teenager of 13 years old, and  although
   he achieved the necessary qualifications  to  obtain  a  place  to  study
   Business Studies at Thames Valley University, he left there after a  year
   and began committing street-related offences.  He was gambling, and had a
   significant alcohol and drug addiction problem.

49. While in prison,  the  claimant  had  undertaken  courses  in  drug  and
   alcohol management, as well as skills courses  on  mathematics,  English,
   and various City and Guilds certificate.  Since leaving prison on licence
   (he will remain on licence  until  3  December  2018  when  his  sentence
   expires), he has been successfully discharged from the post-release  drug
   and alcohol treatment programme.  He remains on antidepressants  and  has
   been referred for neurological testing.

50. The Judge took account of the  second  OASys  report  on  the  claimant,
   completed on 13 November 2015 before his release.  The  report  indicates
   some progress on insight into his offending, but on the page marked 'Risk
   of Serious Harm Screening (Layer 3)' the report indicates that  he  still
   has control issues or disruptive behaviour, that there  are  concerns  in
   respect of breach of trust, and that he is considered to  be  a  risk  to
   other prisoners. On 27 June 2015, he was moved to  the  segregation  unit
   for disruptive behaviour, because he had barricaded his cell. He had been
   placed in special accommodation on 6 July 2015 for trying to set fire  to
   his cell.  The report concluded that the claimant presented a Medium risk
   of serious harm to the public or to known adults, which is defined thus:

          "Medium risk of serious harm - there are  identifiable  indicators
         of serious harm.  The offender has the potential to  cause  serious
         harm but is  unlikely  to  do  so  unless  there  is  a  change  in
         circumstances, for example, failure to  take  medication,  loss  of
         accommodation, relationship breakdown, drug or alcohol misuse'.

51. The claimant told the interviewing officer that he still needed  support
   with anger management, that he struggled with controlling his temper  and
   emotional management, linked  to  his  depression  medication,  which  he
   considered to have the  side-effect  of  aggression  and  temper  control
   problems.  The claimant asked for support in this area.  In his decision,
   the Judge said that both OASys reports considered the claimant to present
   a low risk of reoffending, 'although, of course, of medium risk [of harm]
   in terms of the people who might be offended against' and concluded  that
   the claimant did not continue to be a danger to the  community.   I  note
   that there was no more recent evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   than the November 2015 OASys report.

52. Again, the Judge's finding of fact that the presumption is  rebutted  is
   not supported by the evidence and is perverse.  I consider, having regard
   to the matters set out above, that it was not open to the  Judge  on  the
   evidence to find that  the  section  72  presumption  of  danger  to  the
   community had been displaced.

53. It follows from these findings that neither presumption  in  section  72
   is rebutted.  The Secretary of State's section 72 certificate stands, and
   the Refugee Convention element of this appeal must be dismissed.

Humanitarian protection

54. The First-tier  Tribunal  made  no  separate  decision  on  humanitarian
   protection, to which the section 72 certification regime does not  apply.
   Neither party has suggested, having regard to  the  exclusion  provisions
   relating to subsidiary protection contained in Article 17(1)(b)  and  (d)
   of the Qualification Directive 2004/83/EC,  that  the  outcome   of  this
   appeal would have been different under the Refugee or Person in  Need  of
   International Protection (Qualification) Regulations 2006  (as  amended).
   On the basis of the arguments  before  me,  the  humanitarian  protection
   claim falls with the Refugee Convention claim.

Article 3 and cessation in international law

55. The remaining question is whether the claimant can be removed  from  the
   United Kingdom, or whether he is protected  from  removal  by  Article  3
   ECHR, as set out in Mugagwa.

56. The risk for this claimant on return to Mogadishu  is  analysed  by  the
   First-tier Tribunal on the basis of the Upper Tribunal's country guidance
   in MOJ v Secretary of State for the Home Department.  The relevant  parts
   of the judicial headnote are as follows:

         "(vii)           A person returning to Mogadishu after a period of
         absence will look to his nuclear family, if he has  one  living  in
         the city, for assistance in re-establishing himself and securing  a
         livelihood. Although a returnee may also seek assistance  from  his
         clan members who are not close relatives, such help is only  likely
         to be forthcoming for majority clan members, as minority clans  may
         have little to offer.

         (viii)         The significance of clan membership in Mogadishu has
         changed. Clans now provide, potentially, social support  mechanisms
         and assist  with  access  to  livelihoods,  performing  less  of  a
         protection function than previously. There are no clan militias  in
         Mogadishu, no clan  violence,  and  no  clan  based  discriminatory
         treatment, even for minority clan members.

         (ix)              If it is accepted that a person facing a  return
         to Mogadishu after a period of absence has  no  nuclear  family  or
         close relatives in  the  city  to  assist  him  in  re-establishing
         himself on return, there will need to be a  careful  assessment  of
         all of the circumstances. These considerations  will  include,  but
         are not limited to:

          �       circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;

         �       length of absence from Mogadishu;

         �       family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;

         �       access to financial resources;

         �       prospects  of  securing  a  livelihood,  whether  that  be
         employment or self employment;

         �       availability of remittances from abroad;

         �       means of support during  the  time  spent  in  the  United
         Kingdom;

         �       why his ability to fund the journey to the West no  longer
         enables an appellant to secure financial support on return.

          x)             Put another way, it will be for the person facing
         return to explain why he would not be able to access  the  economic
         opportunities  that  have  been  produced  by  the  economic  boom,
         especially as there is evidence to the effect  that  returnees  are
         taking jobs at the expense of those who have never been away.

         (xi)             It will, therefore, only be those with no clan or
         family support who will not  be  in  receipt  of  remittances  from
         abroad and who have no  real  prospect  of  securing  access  to  a
         livelihood on return who  will  face  the  prospect  of  living  in
         circumstances  falling  below   that   which   is   acceptable   in
         humanitarian protection terms.

         (xii)            The evidence indicates clearly  that  it  is  not
         simply those who originate from Mogadishu that  may  now  generally
         return to live in the city without being subjected  to  an  Article
         15(c) risk or facing a real risk of destitution. On the other hand,
         relocation in Mogadishu for a person of a minority  clan   with  no
         former links to the city, no access to funds and no other  form  of
         clan, family or social support is unlikely to be realistic  as,  in
         the absence of means to establish a home and some form  of  ongoing
         financial  support  there  will  be  a  real  risk  of  having   no
         alternative but to live in makeshift accommodation  within  an  IDP
         camp where there is  a  real  possibility  of  having  to  live  in
         conditions   that   will   fall   below   acceptable   humanitarian
         standards."

57. The First-tier Tribunal  made  findings  of  fact,  applying  the  above
   guidance.  I note the failure to deal with the UNHCR evidence,  but  that
   evidence strengthens rather than weakens the claimant's case as  to  risk
   and instability in Mogadishu.  I am satisfied that the error  in  failing
   to deal with the UNHCR letter is immaterial in this appeal. The weight to
   be given to country expert evidence is  a  matter  for  the  fact-finding
   Tribunal.  The Judge's approach to the evidence of Professor  Aguilar  is
   robust,  but again, a more  nuanced  approach  would  have  favoured  the
   claimant.  I do not find that the Judge's approach to Professor Aguilar's
   evidence was such as to amount to a material error of law.

58. There is no challenge by  the  Secretary  of  State  to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal's findings of fact.   The Judge found  that  the  claimant  left
   Mogadishu as 2-year old child; that his entire family are in  the  United
   Kingdom and are British citizens, that his family in the  United  Kingdom
   are largely dependent on state benefits and 'no doubt struggling to  meet
   their own needs', and that the claimant was  a  member  of  the  minority
   Midgan clan with no clan links  in  Mogadishu.   He  concluded  that  the
   claimant would have very poor financial prospects and  would  be  one  of
   those  who  would  have  no  alternative  but  to   live   in   makeshift
   accommodation in an IDP camp.  That finding was open to him on the  facts
   and evidence before him.

59. On that basis, Article 3 ECHR is applicable to the facts as found.  This
   decision contains errors of law (principally, the approach to section  72
   and the confused approach to Article 8 ECHR and part VA of the 2002 Act).
    But the claimant is entitled to succeed under Article  3  ECHR,  on  the
   basis of current conditions in Somalia and  the  factual  matrix  in  his
   case.


DECISION

60. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:
   The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on  a
   point of law.
   I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision  by  dismissing
   the Refugee Convention appeal but allowing it under Article 3 ECHR.
