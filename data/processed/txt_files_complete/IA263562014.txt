Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr S A Canter, counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is from Ukraine and is 27 years old.  She  appeals  with
      permission against the determination of First-tier tier Tribunal Judge
      Stott who dismissed her appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  on
      human rights grounds.


   2. The appellant had applied for leave on the basis of  her  relationship
      with Mr Paul Harris, who was her partner at the time  the  application
      was made. That application was refused on 18 June 2014.  At  the  date
      of refusal, she was thus single.


   3. She subsequently married her sponsor, Mr Paul Harris, at Gretna  Green
      in Scotland on 10 October 2014.


   4. She claimed at the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  her
      situation had changed since the refusal as she  was  now  married  and
      accordingly the  provisions  of  paragraph  EX.1  can  be  taken  into
      account. She has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  her
      partner,  a  UK  citizen,  who  is  settled  in  the  UK.  There   are
      insurmountable obstacles to family life being  continued  outside  the
      UK.


   5. Judge Stott referred to the applicable provisions under the rules  set
      out in Appendix FM, noting that account must  also  be  taken  of  the
      provisions of s.117B-D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
      2002 when considering the public interest considerations applicable to
      a claim under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.


   6. The appellant had stated in her application that they  only  commenced
      cohabitation in October 2013. She was therefore unable to satisfy  the
      provisions of paragraph GEN 1.2 as they had not been  living  together
      in a relationship akin to marriage for a period of two years.


   7. Even though not raised in the refusal  notice,  the  validity  of  the
      marriage was challenged. There was significant disparity  between  the
      oral evidence of  the  appellant  and  her  sponsor  as  to  how  they
      celebrated her last birthday. [7b]


   8. The appellant came  to  the  UK  in  2006,  entitled  to  work  as  an
      agricultural seasonal worker. She did not return at the end of the six
      month period but remained as an overstayer from 2006 onwards.


   9. The respondent stated that even if  it  is  accepted  that  the  union
      between the appellant and her sponsor is genuine,  the  provisions  of
      EX.1 are not satisfied. The appellant gave evidence  that  her  mother
      lives in Ukraine, although working for several months of each year  in
      Poland. The family home remains to  be  used,  despite  the  appellant
      stating that it had no water or gas available.


  10. The appellant is 27 years old and came here when she was 19.  She  has
      been able to maintain herself here despite residing  here  unlawfully.
      She has demonstrated resource and determination and she would be  able
      to maintain herself in Ukraine where she spent 19 years of her life.


  11. She claims to have married Mr Harris in 2014. He is  a  self  employed
      plasterer, earning in excess of ï¿½22,000 per annum. She  said  that  he
      was extremely busy. It was contended however that he  would  have  the
      financial capability of transferring money to the appellant in Ukraine
      to enable her to make an application  under  the  rules  for  re-entry
      here.


  12. The appellant stated that it would be "extremely difficult" for her to
      use the former family home on account of its condition and due to  her
      having been away from Ukraine for eight years [7g].


  13. There was an option for the sponsor to accompany his wife  to  Ukraine
      as he is self-employed and gave every indication that there was plenty
      of work for him in the UK, to which he could return after a period. He
      could stay with her whilst she made her  application  for  entry.  The
      opportunities for plasterers in Ukraine were not known. However, there
      was no evidence given to suggest that he could  not  resume  his  self
      employment by carrying on his trade on return.


  14. It was contended by he respondent that her private life as well as the
      relationship with her partner had both been established while she  was
      unlawfully resident in the UK. Little weight could therefore be  given
      to either her private life or the relationship which she formed. There
      were thus no compelling reasons why she  should  not  be  required  to
      return and the consequences would not be unduly harsh for her.


  15. The Judge referred to the appellant's case, including her  grounds  of
      appeal, her oral evidence and the skeleton argument. The fact  of  her
      valid marriage should be accepted even though no marriage  certificate
      had been produced. As  there  had  been  a  valid  marriage,  she  was
      entitled to rely upon the provisions of paragraph E-LTRP 2.2  and  the
      requirements set out in EX.1 of the Rules.


  16. The appellant had been frank in stating that her mother still lives in
      Ukraine; she still has to seek employment in Poland for several months
      of the year. If the appellant had to return to Ukraine on her own  she
      would only have use of the former family home, which  has  no  running
      water or gas.


  17. As to the suggestion that her sponsor could return with her, she  said
      that he has an established business and is working  hard  to  build  a
      married life. He rents a home and although he would be able to support
      her financially to some extent, the majority of his money is spent  on
      his living expenses.


  18. Insofar as "insurmountable obstacles" are concerned, these  should  be
      considered in the light of the amendment to paragraph  EX.1  requiring
      ".....very significant difficulties in continuing  family  life  which
      would not be overcome  and  would  entail  serious  hardship  for  the
      appellant or her partner."


  19. It was argued that the former phraseology should be  interpreted  with
      that amendment in mind.


  20. As regards the making a fresh application, this could be done; but the
      length of time it would take for such an application to be assessed is
      unknown. Accordingly, it was not realistic or feasible to  expect  the
      sponsor to leave his job and his family to accompany her. He does  not
      speak the language  and  there  is  no  evidence  of  availability  of
      employment for him in Ukraine. It would therefore  be  jeopardising  a
      successful business created in the UK.


  21.  At  the  hearing,  the  relevant  visa  processing  times   regarding
      applications from Ukraine for a settlement visa were provided:   About
      10% are processed within ten days; 50% in just  over  two  weeks;  70%
      within 30 days; 90% within 60 days and 100% within 90 days.  The  data
      provided related to all decisions made during December 2014.


  22.  For  the  purposes  of  EX.1(b),  it  is  provided   in   EX.2   that
      "insurmountable obstacles" means  the  very  significant  difficulties
      which would be faced by the applicant or their partner  in  continuing
      their family life together outside the  UK  and  which  could  not  be
      overcome or would entail very serious hardship for  the  applicant  or
      their partner.


  23. It was also contended on behalf of  the  appellant  that  she  had  an
      arguable case for an Article 8 claim to be considered if she  did  not
      satisfy the immigration rules. The provisions of s.117B-D of the  2002
      Act must  be  taken  into  account.  It  was  accepted  that  she  had
      overstayed her leave for many years, but during that time she has  not
      sought benefits and has been able to maintain herself.


  24. It was submitted that account should  be  taken  of  the  approach  in
      Chikwamba [2008] UKHL  40  which  decided  that  the  refusal  of  the
      application was  disproportionate if there was no sensible reason  for
      requiring the appellant in that case to return to her country  to  re-
      apply when the outcome was clear. In the circumstances of  that  case,
      the refusal of  the  application  was  held  to  be  disproportionate.
      Likewise, in the appellant's case, her sponsor is well  able  to  meet
      the financial limits set out in the immigration rules and the  parties
      have now entered into a valid marriage which  has  been  evidenced  by
      members of the family. To require her simply to return to  Ukraine  to
      make  an  application  which  has   the   prospect   of   success   is
      disproportionate in all the circumstances [8].


  25. Judge Stott accepted that the parties were  living  together  [9].  He
      also accepted that their marriage was entered into on 10 October  2014
      at Gretna Green [10]. It is accepted that  she  overstayed  her  leave
      from 2006 until she made her application. In view of her marriage,  he
      found that she could rely on the provisions of paragraph EX.1.


  26. The issue was whether or not there are insurmountable obstacles to her
      family life now being continued outside the UK, namely in Ukraine.  He
      found that there is a family house available and that  her  mother  is
      there for part of the year. Although this is a small village  and  the
      appellant has been away for  several  years,  there  was  no  evidence
      suggesting that she would not know other people in  that  village  who
      would be well disposed towards her. She is able to speak the  language
      [12].


  27. Although it was contended  that  the  current  security  situation  in
      Ukraine would also pose a considerable risk to her,  the  Judge  noted
      that no evidence was given as to the proximity or nature of that  risk
      and he "discounted that particular argument." [13]


  28. Judge Stott accepted that her sponsor would be loath to accompany her,
      bearing in mind that he does not  speak  the  language,  that  he  has
      family in the UK and an established business. However, he  also  noted
      that her sponsor knew of his wife's lack of status several weeks after
      they met in 2010.  He  therefore  entered  into  a  relationship  well
      knowing its precarious nature [14].


  29. Judge Stott found that the sponsor  would  be  well  able  to  provide
      financial help to her.  Although not minimising the  difficulties  she
      would face on her own, those would be for a  relatively  short  period
      during the course of which she could communicate with her  husband  as
      well as being able to receive his financial help. Consequently he  did
      not find that the obstacles facing her are  insurmountable,  nor  that
      they would entail her suffering very  serious  hardship  even  if  the
      amended definition in EX.2 is applied [16].


  30. He considered that the appellant had established a family and  private
      life in the UK. He accepted that she entered  into  a  valid  marriage
      with Mr Harris. Having overstayed for a long  period  she  would  have
      built up friendships and contacts [17].


  31. The provisions of s.117B-D are mandatory. It is in the public interest
      that effective immigration control is maintained. Furthermore,  little
      weight should be given to a private life and relationship formed  when
      the individual is in the UK unlawfully. That is the  situation  facing
      the appellant [18]. He took into account that she speaks  English  and
      has financial independence [19].


  32. He had regard to decisions including Razgar and Gulshan.  He  accepted
      that she would face difficulty on  her  return.   When  assessing  the
      appellant's claim under  the  Human  Rights  Convention,  he  did  not
      consider that it would be unduly harsh for her now to have  to  return
      to Ukraine so as to make an application. Although having regard to the
      length of time she had been in the UK she had  weakened  her  ties  to
      Ukraine, he found that she is resourceful and determined and would  be
      able to maintain herself despite not initially speaking the language.


  33. With regard to Chikwamba, that decision pre-dated  the  amendments  to
      the 2002 Act which directed that little  weight  is  to  be  given  to
      either the private life or relationship formed whilst the  person  was
      in the UK unlawfully.


  34. Having balanced the factors both for and against  the  application  of
      Article 8, he found that it would not be disproportionate for  her  to
      return to Ukraine to make a fresh application.


    The appeal to the Upper Tribunal


  35. On 16 December  2014,  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Zucker
      granted the appellant permission to appeal. He noted that the  grounds
      submitted in the permission application asserted that the Judge  erred
      in failing  adequately  to  consider  whether  family  life  could  be
      continued outside the UK within the meaning of the  exceptions  within
      Appendix FM and wrongly held that the guiding principles in  Chikwamba
      are not applicable to the facts of the appeal.


  36. Mr Canter relied on these two grounds. He  submitted  that  the  Judge
      wrongly focused only on  the  obstacles  and  hardship  faced  by  the
      appellant in relocating to Ukraine temporarily [16]. In fact, EX.1 (b)
      requires a consideration of the obstacles to family life  between  the
      appellant and the sponsor continuing in  Ukraine.  He  contended  that
      there is no indication that the Judge "has done  this"  beyond  noting
      (at paragraph 14) that the sponsor would be loath to accompany her. It
      had been argued that there would be  very  serious  hardship  in  such
      relocation on the basis that his income would be likely to drop  below
      the requisite threshold so that  he  would  be  unable  to  sponsor  a
      successful entry clearance application.


  37.  Accordingly,  the  Judge  wrongly  confined  the   consideration   of
      insurmountable obstacles to the appellant individually rather than  to
      her and her husband jointly.


  38. He submitted that the evidence of all the obstacles and hardship  that
      the couple would face in Ukraine had  been  set  out  in  the  witness
      statements as well as  in  oral  evidence.  Accordingly,  focusing  on
      obstacles and hardships faced only by  the  appellant  alone  and  not
      considering all the factors as set out in her  witness  statement  and
      referred to in evidence, meant that a  proper  consideration  had  not
      taken place. Moreover, it had not been argued that the civil war posed
      a considerable threat to the appellant but rather that the  civil  war
      added to the hardship that  would  be  faced  due  to  the  consequent
      economic deprivation in Ukraine.


  39. He also submitted (ground 2) that the  Judge  erred  in  holding  that
      Chikwamba  would  not  survive   the   introduction   of   Article   8
      considerations into statute. Lord Brown had stated that the  principle
      applied notwithstanding the existence of policy considerations to  the
      contrary. Mr Canter submitted that section 117B reflects  such  policy
      considerations but does not change  the  measure  of  Article  8.  The
      Immigration Act 2014 which introduced the section was  accompanied  by
      the express  statement  that  it  was  compatible  with  human  rights
      obligations which included the interpretation of Article 8 as espoused
      in Chikwamba.


  40. He also submitted that whilst s.117B  provides  that  "little  weight"
      should be given  to  a  relationship  formed  whilst  the  appellant's
      presence was unlawful or her status was precarious, it  did  not  mean
      that no weight must be given. Once it was  established  that  she  had
      family life and private life, irrespective of s.117, it  fell  to  the
      respondent to justify whether or not there was some sensible reason to
      require her to return home to apply.


  41. The Judge did not consider this even in  the  assessment  relating  to
      proportionality. A proper evaluation of the difficulties  referred  to
      was missing from the proportionality assessment. Whilst accepting [20]
      that there would be difficulties, the Judge stated that it  would  not
      be "unduly harsh" for her to return. However, the test was not one  of
      "undue harshness" - that  is  a  test  relevant  in  asylum  law  when
      assessing internal relocation - but one of proportionality.


  42. Accordingly, the Judge did not properly assess the  question  required
      to be considered, namely whether or not the  interference  with  their
      family life could be justified. Given that it had been  accepted  that
      there were difficulties in returning, it is not clear from the reasons
      given why the interference contemplated was justified. In  particular,
      no assessment was made as to the financial difficulties that a  return
      to Ukraine would entail.


  43. Mr Melvin in his Rule 24 response noted the Judge's findings  relating
      to their cohabiting as well as  their  marriage  entered  into  on  10
      October 2014 and his consideration of whether  family  life  could  be
      continued outside the UK.


  44. Mr Melvin accepted that there was no definitive finding by  the  Judge
      that family life could be continued in Ukraine. However, he  submitted
      that  the  Judge  found  that  the  sponsor  had  entered   into   the
      relationship knowing of its  precarious  nature.  He  also  took  into
      account that there is a family home in Ukraine and other factors of  a
      positive nature to the appellant [12].


  45. He submitted that it is clear from the conclusions at paragraphs 11-16
      that  the  Judge  has  concluded  that  there  are  no  insurmountable
      obstacles to the family life continuing outside the UK.


  46.  The  argument  about  the  conflict  in  Ukraine  was  in  any  event
      speculative. The assertion by  Mr  Canter  that  the  entry  clearance
      officer might, when deciding  the  appellant's  application,  'make  a
      mistake' was also speculative. The time frame  was  relatively  short,
      being at most up to three months. However, 70%  of  applications  were
      considered within 30 days.


  47. Insofar as the Chikwamba ground is concerned, that decision was  based
      on a completely different set of immigration rules  and  in  different
      circumstances.  Here  there   are   no   exceptional   or   compelling
      circumstances as to why the appellant should not return to Ukraine  to
      apply for entry clearance. He referred to Hayat [2012] EWCA  Civ  1054
      at [51], where regard was had to a submission made by the secretary of
      state that there is strong Strasbourg and domestic  authority  to  the
      effect that only in exceptional circumstances will a couple  who  have
      formed a union in the full  knowledge  of  the  precarious  status  of
      either of them be entitled to remain pursuant  to  Article  8  rights.
      That applied in this case.


  48. He accordingly submitted that the First-tier Tribunal's findings under
      the Rules and Article 8 are sustainable.


  49. Mr Canter submitted in  reply  that  the  Judge  had  found  that  the
      appellant could endeavour to use the provisions of paragraph EX.1. The
      Judge defined the  issue  as  to  whether  there  were  insurmountable
      obstacles to her family life being continued outside the UK  [11].  Mr
      Canter  stated  that   his  "chief  complaint"  is  that   no   proper
      consideration had been given to the insurmountable obstacles  applying
      to the appellant's partner.


     Assessment


  50. Under paragraph R-LTRP.1.1 (d) of Appendix FM, a person qualifies  for
      leave to remain  as  a  partner  if  they  meet  the  eligibility  and
      suitability requirements and if  paragraph  EX.1  applies.  The  Judge
      accepted that EX.1 did apply. The Judge found that the  appellant  had
      overstayed her leave from 2006. It was accepted that she could use the
      provisions of paragraph EX.1 [11],  having  identified  the  issue  as
      being whether or not there were insurmountable obstacles to her family
      life now being continued outside the UK in Ukraine.


  51. From 28 July 2014, "insurmountable obstacles"  were  defined  as  very
      significant difficulties which would be  faced  by  the  applicant  or
      their partner in continuing their family life together outside the UK,
      which could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship  for
      the applicant or their partner.


  52. Mr Canter submitted that it is evident from passages such as paragraph
      16 of the determination that the emphasis was  upon  the  difficulties
      that the appellant would alone face.  During  the  period  they  could
      communicate and she could receive his financial help.  Judge Stott did
      not find the obstacles "facing her" to  be  insurmountable,  nor  that
      they would entail "her suffering" very serious hardship  even  if  the
      amended definition set out in EX.2 applied [16].


  53. However, upon an analysis of the determination as a whole,  I  do  not
      accept the submission that the Judge's approach has led to the claimed
      material error.  The Judge had earlier taken into account and accepted
      the difficulties that the sponsor would face:  He  took  into  account
      that her sponsor would be loath to accompany her as he does not  speak
      the language; that he has family in the UK; that he has established  a
      successful plastering business in the UK. He also had  regard  to  the
      fact that the sponsor had been aware of the appellant's lack of status
      shortly after they met in 2010 and that they nonetheless entered  into
      a relationship being aware of its precarious nature.


  54. It had also been argued that there  would  be  very  serious  hardship
      facing the couple in such a relocation as his income would  be  likely
      to drop below the requisite ï¿½18,600 so that  he  would  be  unable  to
      support a successful entry clearance application.  There was no  basis
      given for that pessimistic forecast however.  There  was  no  evidence
      given to suggest that he could not continue his trade in the UK whilst
      the appellant's application is pending, nor, if he accompanied her  to
      the Ukraine, that he would be  unable  to  resume  his  self  employed
      status carrying on his trade on return after a few months.


  55. The Judge took into account the evidence from the appellant  that  her
      sponsor was very busy. It was also accepted that  he  would  have  the
      financial capability of transferring money to her in Ukraine to enable
      her to make an application under the rules for  re-entry  here.  There
      was no evidence adduced as to  the  opportunities  for  plasterers  in
      Ukraine.  There was no assertion that any research had been undertaken
      in that regard.


  56. The appellant contended that it would be "extremely difficult" for her
      to use the former family home on account of its condition and  due  to
      her having been away from Ukraine for eight years [7g]. However it was
      accepted that she would have use of the  former  family  home,  albeit
      that it does not have running water or gas.


  57. The Judge pointed out that  there  was  an  option  available  to  the
      couple: the sponsor could decide whether  to  accompany  his  wife  to
      Ukraine as he is self employed and gave every  indication  that  there
      was plenty of work for him in the UK, to which he could return after a
      period. He could stay with her whilst she  made  her  application  for
      entry. On the other hand he could remain abroad pending the outcome of
      an entry clearance application which is not likely to take  very  long
      and could be decided at most within a few months.


  58. The Judge also took into account that there was a civil war  going  on
      in the west of the country. The civil war added to the hardship  based
      on the consequent economic deprivation in Ukraine rather than anything
      specific to the life or physical integrity of  the  appellant  or  her
      sponsor.


  59. I find that there has been a proper assessment  of  the  obstacles  to
      family life between  the  appellant  and  her  sponsor  continuing  in
      Ukraine.   The  Judge   did   not   confine   the   consideration   of
      insurmountable obstacles to the appellant individually but had  proper
      regard to obstacles applicable to her and her husband jointly.


  60. I have had regard to Mr Canter's submissions relating to  the  Judge's
      statement that the Chikwamba approach did not survive the introduction
      of Article 8 considerations into statute. Lord Brown had  stated  that
      the  principle  applied,  notwithstanding  the  existence  of   policy
      considerations to the contrary. The Judge also wrongly had regard to a
      test - unduly harsh -  more  appropriate  to  internal  relocation  in
      asylum cases.  The test he submitted was one of  proportionality.  The
      question related to whether or not the  interference  contemplated  in
      their family life was justifiable.


  61. Section 117B contains such  policy  considerations.  I  was  informed,
      without any assertion to the contrary, that when the  Immigration  Act
      2014 was introduced, it was accompanied by the express statement  that
      it was compatible with human rights obligations.


  62. I accept that these obligations include the interpretation of  Article
      8 as expressed in Chikwamba. The issue then is whether there has  been
      a material error of law in the circumstances of this case.  The  issue
      in the second ground is whether in the absence of a sensible reason to
      the contrary, the appellant should be required to return to Ukraine in
      order to seek entry clearance.


  63. The Judge has set out the difficulties associated with her return  for
      the appellant and her sponsor, which I have set out above. The sponsor
      has the option to remain in the UK whilst  her  application  is  being
      considered or he can accompany  his  wife  to  Ukraine.  He  is  self-
      employed and indicated that there was plenty of work for  him  in  the
      UK, to which he could return after a period. He could  stay  with  her
      whilst she made her application for entry.


  64. Although the opportunities for plasterers in Ukraine  were  not  known
      there was no evidence given to suggest that he could  not  resume  his
      self employment by carrying on his trade  on  return.  He  is  in  the
      position to be able to support the appellant for the relatively  short
      period it would take for her application to be decided.

  65. I have had regard to the Court of Appeal's decision  in  Hayat  [2012]
      EWCA Civ 1054 and the House of Lords Chikwamba [2008] UKHL  40,  where
      Lord Brown stated that he was far from suggesting that the  respondent
      should routinely apply the policy of requiring the appellant to  apply
      for leave from abroad in all but exceptional cases. It seemed  to  him
      that only comparatively rarely, certainly in  family  cases  involving
      children, should an Article 8 appeal be dismissed on the basis that it
      would be proportionate and more appropriate for the appellant to apply
      for leave from abroad.

  66. In Hayat, the Court of Appeal stated that if it is clear that there is
      a good claim, it should be granted; if not, it  should  be  dismissed.
      Chikwamba provides that where  Article  8  is  engaged,  the  decision
      makers should not, absent some good reason, fail to  engage  with  the
      merits and dismiss the claim  on  the  grounds  that  the  application
      should be made from abroad.


  67. The provisions of s.117B-D of the 2002 Act must be taken into account.
      It was accepted that the appellant had overstayed her leave  for  many
      years. On the other hand she has not sought benefits and has been able
      to maintain herself. Although she entered into a lawful  marriage  her
      husband had been aware since at least a few weeks after he met her  in
      2010 that she had no immigration status and was here unlawfully.


  68. He thus entered into relationship well knowing its precarious  nature.
      The Judge thus properly had regard  to  the  mandatory  provisions  of
      sections 117B-D.  In particular it was in  the  public  interest  that
      effective immigration control be maintained.


  69. As submitted by Mr Melvin the respondent has not had  the  opportunity
      of  considering  whether  the  appellant  does  satisfy  the  relevant
      requirements  under  the  rules,  including   the   English   language
      provisions.


  70. The relevant documentation required to be produced under Appendix  FM-
      SE has not been disclosed. It is thus not evident that this is a  case
      where it is clear that there is a good claim.


  71. I find no merit in Mr Canter's submission  that  the  entry  clearance
      application might not succeed.  That is an irrelevant matter.


  72. Having balanced the factors both for and against  the  application  of
      Article 8, the Judge found that it would not be  disproportionate  for
      her to return to Ukraine to make a fresh application.


  73. Despite the failure by the Judge to consider the approach set  out  in
      Chikwamba and Hayat, supra, I find for the reasons referred to  above,
      that there has not been a material error of law in the circumstances.


  74. I accordingly find that the making of the decision by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal did not involve the making of any material errors of law. The
      decision shall accordingly stand.
