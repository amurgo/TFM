                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals on procedural fairness grounds from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss his appeal against the refusal of
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, following a hearing
    at which he was legally  represented,  but  which  he  did  not  attend
    himself as he says he was too ill to do so.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity direction, and I do  not  consider  that  the
    appellant  requires  anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 9 September 2016  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Brunnen  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         The grounds on which permission to  appeal  is  sought  submit  the
         judge erred  in  law  by  refusing  the  application  made  on  the
         appellant's behalf for the hearing to be adjourned as he was unable
         to attend because he was suffering from diarrhoea.  The  record  of
         the appellant's  interview  by  Skype  was  only  produced  by  the
         respondent  at  the  hearing  and  the  absent  appellant  had   no
         opportunity to see it.  The interview was central to the issues  in
         the appeal.  The judge decided the appeal against the appellant for
         credibility reasons.  This ground is arguable.

Relevant Background Facts

 3. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh, whose date  of  birth  is  4
    February 1980.  On 10 July 2012 he was granted leave to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Post-Study  Work)  Migrant  until  10  July
    2014.  On 11 September 2014 he applied for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  On 16 December 2014 the  appellant  "attended"
    an interview about his application.  Although the subsequent  interview
    record does not show this, apparently the interview  was  conducted  on
    Skype rather than at a face to face meeting.

 4. On 19 January 2015 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing
    the application.  She relied on non-points scoring reasons for refusal.



 5. On the topic of the viability and credibility of the  source  of  money
    referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A, she quoted from Q&A  29,  Q&A  34
    and Q&A 5 in the interview transcript.

 6. On the topic of  the  viability  and  credibility  of  the  applicant's
    business plans and market research into the chosen business centre, the
    respondent quoted from Q&A 8, Q&A 9 and Q&A 13.

 7. On the topic of market research, the respondent quoted from Q&A 17;  on
    the topic of contracts the respondent quoted from Q&A 25;  and  on  the
    topic of the applicant's previous educational business  experience  (or
    lack thereof), the respondent quoted from Q&A 2.

 8. In most  cases,  the  respondent  quoted  verbatim  extracts  from  the
    interview transcript.  In the remainder, the respondent gave a summary.
    In respect of Q&A 29, she asserted that the appellant had replied  with
    an incomprehensible answer, and it was quite evident that  he  did  not
    understand the question.  In respect of  Q&A  25,  she  summarised  the
    appellant as saying that he received money from the contracts, but that
    he had not provided any evidence of any payments.  In respect of Q&A 2,
    the respondent summarised the appellant as  saying  that  he  had  been
    working full-time and part-time at Starbucks and prior to that  he  had
    worked in a spa for nearly four years.   The  respondent's  observation
    was that these jobs  had  not  provided  the  appellant  with  relevant
    business experience.

 9. The appellant's previous representatives  settled  lengthy  grounds  of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal running to 46  paragraphs.  No  issue
    was taken as to the accuracy of the answers  in  interview  which  were
    attributed to the  appellant  in  the  refusal  letter.   Instead,  the
    representatives invoked the respondent's evidential flexibility  policy
    and cited Rodriguez  (Flexibility  Policy)  [2013]  UKUT  42  (IAC)  in
    support of the proposition that, if there were any missing documents or
    further clarification was necessary, then the respondent ought to  have
    contacted the appellant before making a decision on his application.

The Hearing Before and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

10. The appellant's appeal came before Judge  Swaniker  sitting  at  Taylor
    House in the First-tier Tribunal on 22 March 2016.  Both  parties  were
    legally represented.   The  appellant's  bundle  of  documents  at  the
    hearing included a witness statement from the appellant  which  he  had
    made on 25 August 2015.

The witness statement

11. He had not made his Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  application  before
    the expiry of his previous visa, as he needed some more time to  launch
    his business  formally.   He  confirmed  that  he  was  called  for  an
    interview arranged by the Home Office and he attended the interview  on
    16 December 2014.  In the interview he had tried his best to answer all
    the queries of the Home Office officials despite the fact that he found
    the whole experience daunting and unfamiliar.  He was in serious stress
    and not feeling well.

12. He had clearly explained to the Home  Office  officials  that  although
    initially he and his business partner Mr Md Faisal Jamil started  their
    business and both of  them  bought  equal  numbers  of  shares  in  the
    business, subsequently Mr Jamil had wanted to remove himself  from  the
    business and had wanted to sell his shares.  So he  bought  Mr  Jamil's
    shares.  In the interview he had taken all the documents  with  him  in
    this respect but he did not have a chance to provide  them  because  it
    was a Skype interview and the interviewer  did  not  ask  him  for  any
    evidence.

13. It was not correct that he failed to mention or not know  the  name  of
    his business.  He mentioned his company's  name  clearly  and  answered
    clearly that his company was registered with Companies  House.  He  had
    clearly explained that the reason why he  had  registered  his  company
    with Companies House was because it was a legal  requirement.   He  had
    also given a clear account of his business expenses  e.g.  house  rent,
    transportation costs, administrative, marketing and  advertising  costs
    etc.  He clearly explained his market research process and the tools he
    had used in this respect.  He had also  explained  the  nature  of  the
    business.  He was not asked about his revenue growth project for  which
    he also had clear evidence and sufficient documentation which could  be
    provided with ease.

14. So far as he could see, in  the  refusal  decision  the  reasoning  was
    surrounded and based solely on the outcome of his interview performance
    without giving adequate  consideration  to  the  submitted  "conclusive
    evidence and documentations".

The Adjournment Request

15. As recorded in paragraph [9] of the judge's subsequent decision, at the
    outset of the hearing, Mr Islam appearing for the  appellant  requested
    an adjournment. He had a text message from the appellant indicating  he
    was unable to attend and he showed the judge the message on his  mobile
    phone.  The judge noted that, according to the message,  the  appellant
    was suffering from diarrhoea and was unable to attend the hearing.  The
    appellant asked for the hearing to carry on without him, but ended with
    a request for the hearing to be adjourned.

16. The judge informed Mr Islam he  did  not  consider  it  appropriate  to
    adjourn the hearing on the information provided, given  that  diarrhoea
    was a condition readily addressed by  a  number  of  over  the  counter
    remedies and there was no  medical  certificate  to  confirm  that  the
    appellant was unable to attend the hearing for the stated reason.   The
    judge put the case to the back  of  her  list  to  give  Mr  Islam  the
    opportunity to apprise the appellant of the position.

17. Upon reconvening the hearing, Mr Islam informed the judge that  he  had
    been unable to contact  the  appellant  as  his  calls  kept  going  to
    voicemail.

18. Against this background, the judge did not consider it would be  unjust
    to proceed with the hearing.  She  was  of  the  opinion  that  on  the
    available evidence the appellant could and should have attended for the
    hearing, and she could find no just cause to adjourn it.  She noted the
    appellant had submitted evidence in support of this appeal and  he  had
    representative present.  She therefore refused the adjournment request.

19. The judge concluded at paragraph [9] by noting that Ms  Bello-Omovbude,
    who appeared for the respondent, had "also" submitted  a  copy  of  the
    appellant's interview record referred to in the refusal letter.

The Submissions

20. The judge records Mr Islam as stating that was he ready to  proceed  by
    way of submissions, and the judge  sets  out  the  submissions  of  the
    representatives in some detail  in  paragraphs  [10]  to  [13]  of  her
    decision.

21. In opening, Mr Islam submitted that the appeal should be allowed on the
    documents which the appellant had provided.   In  the  absence  of  any
    adverse finding against the share certificate or  the  company  or  the
    HMRC document, the appellant should be given the points.

22. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Bello-Omovbude submitted  that  it  was
    clear from the interview that the  appellant  and  his  entrepreneurial
    team member had split  up.   The  appellant  said  he  had  bought  his
    partner's share but there was no evidence to show this, and so  it  was
    not shown that  the  appellant  had  �50,000  available  to  him.   The
    original plan had been that each of  the  team  members  should  supply
    �25,000 each.  On the  question  of  whether  the  appellant  genuinely
    intended to and was able to establish a business, she submitted that it
    was clear from the interview the appellant  was  not  clear  about  his
    business.  He  was  not  able  to  give  coherent  responses,  and  the
    appellant was very unclear what the business was about.

23. In reply, Mr Islam  queried  whether  it  was  possible  to  conduct  a
    business interview over the telephone and to ask so many questions.  He
    submitted that appellant had proved every single criterion  apart  from
    the credibility issues arising from the interview, and this was  not  a
    requirement of the Rules.  Mr Islam then referred to a  document  which
    he identified as a Companies House document.  He  submitted  that  this
    showed that the appellant had acquired all the shares.

The findings

24. But on further investigation, the judge was satisfied this was not  the
    case.   At  the  end  of  paragraph  [13]  she  noted  that  the  share
    certificate document Mr Islam was referring to clearly stated that  the
    shares were jointly held in equal shares between the appellant and  his
    former partner.

25. The judge's findings of credibility and fact are set out  at  paragraph
    [15] onwards.  At paragraph [15], the judge said that having considered
    the totality of the evidence before her and  the  submissions  made  on
    behalf of both parties to the appeal,  she  had  come  to  the  overall
    conclusion the appellant had failed to discharge the  burden  of  proof
    upon him to establish that he had met  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    245DD of the Immigration Rules.

26. At paragraph [16], she said the respondent had identified a  number  of
    credibility issues arising from the appellant's Home Office  interview.
    She found the interview record  accurately  reflected  the  appellant's
    answers to particular questions identified in the respondent's  refusal
    letter:

         I find no reason to doubt the accuracy of the interview record  and
         I note the appellant does not in terms challenge  the  accuracy  of
         this record.  I for these purposes find it immaterial the interview
         was said to have been conducted by telephone, as I find no credible
         reason why a telephone interview should or  would  yield  different
         results for a physical interview.   I  find  that  the  appellant's
         answers as  shown  in  the  interview  record  indeed  raised/raise
         serious  concerns  about  the  credibility   of   the   appellant's
         application and his intention to set up as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)
         Migrant.

27. On the topic of access to funds, the judge noted at paragraph [18] that
    the appellant had not challenged the respondent's conclusion drawn from
    the interview that the appellant's business partner had withdrawn  from
    the venture by the time of the interview.   Indeed,  if  anything,  his
    representatives' argument had confirmed this position.  So, even if  he
    had access to and had genuinely invested �25,000 into the business, the
    appellant clearly had a shortfall in the minimum required investment of
    �50,000.  She found the appellant had failed to  provide  any  credible
    evidence to demonstrate that  he  had  acquired  his  former  partner's
    shares in the business and had made up the �25,000 shortfall caused  by
    the partner's withdrawal from the business.  So he had not demonstrated
    that he had the minimum specified amount available to him.

28. The judge dismissed the appeal under the  rules  and  on  human  rights
    grounds.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

29. At the hearing before me determined whether an error of  law  was  made
    out, Mr Khosla developed the arguments advanced in the application  for
    permission to appeal.  In reply,  Mr  Singh  adhered  to  the  Rule  24
    response opposing the appeal which had been settled by a colleague.

Discussion

30. It was not part of the respondent's case  that  a  particular  document
    relied on by the appellant was  not  genuine  or  valid.   Accordingly,
    following Ahmed [2014] UKUT 365, it was not going to be permissible for
    Mr Islam to lead evidence from the appellant by way of clarification or
    expansion of the answers which he was recorded as giving in  interview.



31. Mr Khosla submits that Ahmed  does  not  apply  to  oral  evidence,  as
    distinct from documentary  evidence,  but  I  do  not  consider  it  is
    possible to distinguish between the two types of evidence.  Unless  the
    witness merely repeats what is already said in an earlier document,  or
    what he said in interview, the witness is giving new evidence which was
    not before the Secretary of State at the date of decision.  Ahmed makes
    clear that new evidence bearing upon viability or  credibility  of  the
    proposed business is not admissible on appeal.

32. Accordingly, I consider it was open to the judge to refuse to grant  an
    adjournment of the hearing for the reasons which she gave.  It was open
    to her not to take at face value the  appellant's  claim  that  he  was
    unable to attend because of his asserted illness.

33. It is argued in the permission application that it was unreasonable for
    the judge to require the appellant to provide a medical certificate  by
    way of proof of his temporary incapacity.  It is  argued  that  if  the
    appellant was well enough to obtain a medical certificate, he would  be
    well enough to attend the hearing.  Conversely, if he was  telling  the
    truth about being incapacitated by his diarrhoea, then clearly  it  was
    not feasible for him to attend for a medical examination with a view to
    obtaining a sick note.

34. Using her general knowledge and experience, it was open to the judge to
    take the view that in the ordinary course of events the condition which
    the appellant said he was suffering from could be treated  by  an  over
    the counter remedy which  would  enable  him  to  attend  the  hearing.
    Moreover, the issue as  to  the  feasibility  of  obtaining  a  medical
    certificate is somewhat academic, as the appellant was  not  responding
    to telephone calls from his solicitor.  So  the  appellant  never  gave
    instructions to his solicitor that he was too incapacitated  to  attend
    his GP surgery to obtain a doctor's certificate, and hence Mr Islam did
    not renew a request for an adjournment on this ground.

35. The other way the case is put is that the interview transcript was only
    produced at the hearing, and the absence of the appellant meant that Mr
    Islam could not take instructions from the appellant on  its  contents.
    Thus, Mr Khosla submits, it was procedurally unfair for the hearing  to
    proceed with the interview transcript being deployed in evidence,  when
    the appellant was not present to address any issues arising from it.

36. I accept Mr Khosla's submission that the respondent had acted in breach
    of standard directions.  The respondent  ought  to  have  included  the
    interview transcript in the Home Office bundle.  By leaving it  to  the
    beginning of the hearing  to  produce  the  interview  transcript,  the
    respondent was running the risk of a successful adjournment request  or
    a successful request that the evidence should be excluded.

37. However, Mr Islam did not apply for an adjournment on this ground,  nor
    did he ask the judge to exclude the evidence.

38. Mr Khosla submits that nonetheless the judge should have adjourned  the
    hearing of her own motion so as to give the appellant  the  opportunity
    to consider the contents of the interview  transcript.  I  reject  this
    submission for a number of reasons.

39. Firstly, the stance taken by the appellant in his witness statement was
    one of confession and avoidance with respect to the  interview,  rather
    than a stance of disputing the accuracy of  the  answers  in  interview
    which were attributed to him in the refusal letter.  The appellant  did
    not dispute he had performed badly in interview. But he said  this  was
    due to stress and illness, and so, he argued (as  did  Mr  Islam),  his
    credibility should be assessed by reference to the documentary evidence
    and not by reference to his answers in interview. Apart from  disputing
    that he had failed accurately to name the company which he had set  up,
    he did not dispute the accuracy of any of the other answers  attributed
    to him in the refusal letter.

40. Secondly, the interview record spoke for itself.  The appellant did not
    have an alternative interview record to place before the Tribunal.   So
    he was never going to derive any advantage from having  time  to  study
    the remainder of the interview transcript, namely those  parts  of  the
    interview which had not been cited verbatim in the refusal  letter,  as
    he was not going  to  be  able  to  produce  a  better  record  of  the
    interview. He also could not give evidence  by  way  of  clarification,
    correction or expansion of what was recorded, as he was  debarred  from
    doing so by Ahmed.

41. Thirdly, it was implicit in the stance taken by the  appellant  in  his
    witness statement that he would welcome his  legal  representative  and
    the Tribunal seeing the full interview transcript, as part of his  case
    was that in the other parts of the interview which had not been  quoted
    in the refusal letter he had given answers which showed that he  was  a
    genuine entrepreneur. The  Tribunal  had  to  see  the  full  interview
    transcript in order to assess his performance in the round, and it  was
    the appellant's  contention  in  his  witness  statement  that  if  the
    interview was taken in the round he would be shown in  a  better  light
    than what emerged from the extracts quoted in the refusal letter.

42. In conclusion, I am not persuaded  that  the  appellant  has  been  the
    victim of procedural unfairness.  He was not deprived of a fair hearing
    on account of the hearing proceeding in his absence, or an  account  of
    the interview transcript being deployed in evidence at the hearing.  On
    the contrary, it was to his potential advantage that the  Tribunal  was
    able to see the interview transcript, so  as  to  be  able  to  make  a
    rounded credibility assessment, including placing the answers relied on
    by the respondent in context, and being able to ascertain whether there
    was any substance to the appellant's claim that in other parts  of  the
    interview he had given answers which  enhanced  his  credibility  as  a
    genuine entrepreneur.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
