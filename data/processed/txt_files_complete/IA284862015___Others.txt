                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                                  DECISION

On 22 August 2017 I gave the following directions:

            "1.  In a decision dated 14 July 2017 I found that the  decision
           of the First-tier Tribunal dated 24 October  2016  contained  an
           error of law and I set it aside.  Both parties agreed  that  the
           decision would be remade by me but that it was  appropriate  for
           the  hearing  to  be  adjourned  to  enable  the  respondent  to
           reconsider her position following the eldest child's acquisition
           of British citizenship.
            2.   In a position statement dated 17 August 2017, Mr  Bates  on
           behalf  of  the  respondent  confirmed  that  PNC  checks   were
           undertaken of the lead appellant and no adverse information  was
           identified.  The respondent expressly accepted that  it  is  not
           reasonable to expect the child to depart the UK for Nigeria, and
           that it  would  be  appropriate  to  grant  leave  to  the  lead
           appellant and her dependents, to enable them to remain in the UK
           with the British citizen child.
            3.   The respondent invited me  to  decide  the  appeal  on  the
           papers.  My provisional view is that it is appropriate to  allow
           the appeal  without  a  further  hearing.   The  respondent  has
           effectively conceded that as at the date of hearing it would not
           be reasonable to expect the lead appellant and her dependents to
           leave the UK and as such section 117B(6)(b) of  the  Nationality
           Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 works in the appellants' favour,
           such that the appeal should be allowed on Article 8 grounds.
            4.   Subject to any  written  representations  to  the  contrary
           being filed and served before 4pm on Fri  8  September  2017,  a
           decision will be promulgated allowing the appeal  on  the  basis
           set out above."


As no further representations have been provided, this appeal is allowed.


Signed: Ms Melanie Plimmer                             Dated: 25 September
2017
Judge of the Upper Tribunal
