Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Muhammad Munir Bhatti, Sponsor
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   In the first place we are very grateful indeed to Mr Tarlow for a  very
    fair presentation of the case which has made what, on the face  of  it,
    was a somewhat difficult arithmetical calculation rather easier for us.

2.   The appeal is against a decision of Judge  Scobbie  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal which was promulgated on 18 March 2014, and the  issue  before
    us was whether he was correct in calculating the income and savings  of
    the appellant and her family.

3.   The conclusions to which he came showed that the family fell  short  of
    the financial sums required in terms  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Mr
    Tarlow very fairly conceded that his calculations involved  an  element
    of speculation and for our own part we find it impossible to  work  out
    how the various conclusions were reached.  That in itself seems  to  us
    to be an error of law but  furthermore  the  judge  refused  to  accept
    certain documentary evidence purely on the basis that he did not accept
    the sponsor's own word that  the  documents  were  submitted  with  the
    application.  No adverse credibility findings at all were made  in  the
    determination  and  we  would  have  expected  some  comment   on   the
    credibility of the sponsor or at least some reasoning  as  to  why  his
    word was not accepted in that regard.  That again seems to us to be  an
    error of law.

4.   Mr Tarlow very fairly conceded that he would not resist any  submission
    that an error of law was made. We find that the judge fell  into  error
    and we remake the decision.  We heard unchallenged  evidence  from  the
    sponsor as to his financial position.  If his evidence is correct  then
    he does in fact meet the financial provisions in terms of the Rules. We
    do not think it necessary to go into what his  financial  position  is.
    There was no suggestion by Mr Tarlow that the sponsor does not meet the
    Rules and we accept what the latter had to say.

5.   We allow all the appeals.
