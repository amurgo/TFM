               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr  C Cole of Parker Rhodes Hickmotts
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Petterson, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  Bradshaw
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 6th January 2017.

 2. Mrs Pettersen accepted that the decision could not stand.

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Iran born on 27th June 1994.  He  claimed
    asylum in the UK on the basis that he had converted to Christianity and
    had suffered persecution in Iran as a consequence.

 4. The judge rejected the appellant's account in its entirety.

 5. The judge heard oral evidence from a Reverend Clarke of the Elim Church
    in Huddersfield.  She said that there were  discrepancies  between  the
    appellant's  account  of  his  preparation  for  baptism  and  Reverend
    Clarke's understanding of it but it is hard to see  from  the  evidence
    what that discrepancy could be.  In  any  event,  on  the  face  of  it
    Reverend Clarke was providing significant evidence in  support  of  the
    appellant's claim which had to be properly engaged with.

 6. Mrs Pettersen properly acknowledged that there was no  such  engagement
    in this determination.

 7. The judge erred in law  by  failing  to  assess  all  of  the  relevant
    evidence before her.  The decision is set aside.  It will  have  to  be
    remade by a judge other than Judge Bradshaw at a hearing to be fixed in
    Bradford.

No anonymity direction is made.
