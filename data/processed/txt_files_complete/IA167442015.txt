                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant entered the UK on the 30th of June  2012  on  Tier  5  TW
    (Religious) Migrant visa that had been issued in Dhaka on the  12th  of
    June 2012, a copy appears t page 14 of the Appellant's  bundle  of  the
    22nd of December 2015. He applied for LTR under  Tier  2  (Minister  of
    Religion) under paragraph 245HD of the Immigration Rules on the 30th of
    April 2014.

 2. The Tier 2 application was refused in a Refusal Letter of the  16th  of
    April 2015. The Appellant's appeal was heard by Judge Miles sitting  at
    Richmond on the 6th of  January  2016.  He  allowed  the  appeal  in  a
    decision promulgated on the  13th  of  January  2016.  The  appeal  was
    allowed as paragraph 245HD(b)(i)(13) allowed  a  person  granted  entry
    clearance as a Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) to obtain leave under Tier 2.

 3. The Secretary of State obtained  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal. This was on the basis that the Appellant had been admitted as
    a Tier 5 (Religious Worker) and not as a Tier 5 (Temporary Worker)  and
    so did not come within the terms of paragraph 245HD.

 4. At the hearing Mr Bramble explained that paragraph  245HD  included  in
    the list of those who could qualify under Tier 2 included, at paragraph
    (b)(13) a Tier 5 (Temporary Worker). The definition of  that  term  was
    found  in  paragraph  245ZM.  Headed  "Purpose  of   this   route   and
    definitions" it was followed in paragraph (a) which states "This  route
    is for certain types of temporary worker whose entry helps  to  satisfy
    ... religious...objectives including volunteering, and job shadowing."

 5. In essence the term Temporary Worker was subdivided into  a  number  of
    sub-groups of which "religious" was one. The problem with the  decision
    was that the Judge had not  explained  that  the  admission  was  as  a
    Temporary Worker in the religious sub-group. The use of the initials TW
    on his visa indicated that he was in the group  as  required.  This  is
    reinforced by the commentary in McDonalds at page 806, paragraph 10.86.

 6. In short Mr Bramble accepted that the decision did not contain an error
    and that applying the rules to the facts the Appellant had to  succeed.
    This is an arcane area and it is perhaps not surprising that the  Judge
    had not chased out explicitly those parts of the Immigration Rules that
    applied. It is regrettable that permission to appeal was sought on what
    was itself an erroneous ground.

 7. For the Appellant I was asked to make a direction with  regard  to  the
    grant of leave to him. That is an unusual step to take and  whilst  the
    Appellant has been affected by delays which were not of his  making  in
    reaching this decision I cannot see that  his  circumstances  are  much
    different from most other Appellants. In the circumstances I decline to
    make a direction.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a  point  of  law.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal stands including the making of a fee award in the sum of ï¿½140.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  I  make  no
order.

The making of a fee award does not arise.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
