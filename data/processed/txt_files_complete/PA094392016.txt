                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representative:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Haddow, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent refused the appellant's asylum claim for reasons  stated
    in her decision dated 23 August 2016, Annex A,  "detailed  reasons  for
    refusal".


 2. FtT Judge Handley dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  by  his  decision
    promulgated on 7 August 2017.


 3. The appellant applied to the FtT for permission to appeal  to  the  UT.
    His grounds  are  stated  in  7  paragraphs.   Permission  having  been
    refused, he applied to the UT, relying  on  the  same  grounds  and  on
    "additional points" stated in a further 6 paragraphs.


 4. UT Judge Jordan granted permission on 15 December 2017.


 5.  Mr  Matthews  conceded  that   the   original   grounds   (which,   by
    administrative mishap, had not been seen by the respondent prior to the
    hearing) disclosed two errors by the judge: no clear findings about the
    appellant's claimed involvement with Narcotics Anonymous in  Iran,  and
    failure to deal with the "corrections" tendered by the appellant to the
    screening interview.  He said  that  the  errors  were  such  that  the
    decision could not safely stand, and a fresh hearing  in  the  FtT  was
    required.


 6. It is unnecessary to resolve the other grounds.


 7. The appellant agreed to the following outcome.


 8. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.


 9. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.


10. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Handley.


11. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
