For the Appellant: Mr Chaudry for Eden Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr C Bates Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. The Appellant was born on 9 June 1986 and is a national of Pakistan.


3. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as they were  in
   the First-tier Tribunal.
4. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Taylor promulgated on 23 November 2016 which dismissed the
   Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  dated  7
   September 2016 to refuse him a residence card.
5. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons which were  in  essence  that
   the Appellant had failed  to  produce  adequate  evidence  that  the  EEA
   sponsor was exercising treaty rights.
The Judge's Decision
6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Taylor ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against the  Respondent's
   decision .
7. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing: that the Judge  was  in  error  in
   that :
   a) He failed to take into account additional  documents  submitted  under
      cover of a letter dated 2 August 2016
8.  On 25 May  2017  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Page  gave  permission  to
   appeal.
9. There is a Rule 24 response dated 19 June 2017 which argued that  on  the
   basis of the material before the Judge the findings were open to him.

10. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Chaudhry  on  behalf  of  the
   Appellant that :

   (a)The Appellant was not represented at the time of the submission of his
   application or the appeal.

   (b) The documents submitted by the Appellant on 2.8.2017 in  addition  to
   what had previously been  sent  would  have  entitled  the  Appellant  to
   succeed.  Therefore  not  taking  them  into  account  made  a   material
   difference.

   (c) The Appellant asserts that he submitted further documents after those
   submitted on 2 August.

   (d) The Sponsor also had a cleaning job  and  referred  to  that  in  the
   letter of August 2nd.

11. On behalf of the Respondent Mr Bates submitted that :

   a) He accepted that the Respondents file contained a copy of  the  letter
      of August 2nd and the documents referred to in  the  letter  but  that
      this did not appear to have been included in the Respondents bundle.

   b) The Judge referred in paragraph 8 to only  one  bank  statement  being
      before him.

   c) The Appellant had the opportunity  to  include  with  the  grounds  of
      appeal additional evidence to address the concerns f the Respondent or
      to explain matters at an oral  hearing:  he  submitted  no  additional
      material with the grounds of appeal and chose to have a paper hearing.

   d) The Appellant was relying on paper documents to establish his case and
      they had to be clear. The evidence produced now  all  post  dates  the
      hearing date.

   e) While the Judge may not have had a respondents bundle which  may  have
      been a procedural error it was not material  to  the  outcome  of  the
      case.

   f) In relation to the cleaner job the Judge had no receipts  or  no  bank
      statements to reflect payments in from the work .

12. In reply Mr Chaudhry on behalf of the Appellant submitted:

   a) The relevant evidence was before the Judge although he could  not  say
      it with 100% certainty.

   b) He conceded that there was no reference to an invoice book or invoices
      in the letter of 2 August.

Finding on Material Error

13. Having heard  those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made no errors of law that were material to the outcome  of  the
   case.

14. The issue in this case  was  whether  the  Appellants  EEA  sponsor  had
   established  by  the  production  of  adequate  evidence  that  she   was
   exercising treaty rights by reference to the EEA  Regulations  2006.  The
   burden of proof in this case was upon the Appellant and the  standard  of
   proof was upon the balance of probability. The Appellant bore the  burden
   of proof to establish  any  EEA  right  of  admission  or  residence.  In
   relation to the relevant date I am satisfied that in Boodhoo and  another
   (EEA Regs: relevant evidence) [2013] UKUT  00346 (IAC) where it was  held
   that in an EEA appeal, a tribunal has  power  to  consider  any  evidence
   which it thinks relevant to the  substance  of  the  decision,  including
   evidence which concerns a matter arising after the date of the decision.

15. Therefore it was  open  to  the  Appellant  to  produce  any  additional
   evidence to establish the sponsors status up to and including the date of
   hearing that had not previously been produced. The Appellant  appears  to
   have implicitly accepted that he had not produced sufficient evidence  as
   stated in the refusal letter  but  submitted  additional  evidence  under
   cover of a letter dated 2 August 2016 that he argued should have resulted
   in the appeal being  allowed  but  the  Judge  ignored.  He  was  granted
   permission to appeal on the basis that this was arguable.

16. It is clear that the Judge did not have a  Respondents  bundle  when  he
   made the decision on 10 November 2016 as there is a bundle  in  the  file
   which has been endorsed by him 'These respondent  bundles  arrived  after
   promulgation' signed by him and dated 22/11/2016.  However  I  note  that
   looking at the bundle it does not contain the letter referred to  by  the
   Appellant of 2 August 2016. Thus the  absence  of  that  bundle  made  no
   difference to the case as it did not contain the documents relied on.

17. However reading the decision and in particular paragraphs 7  and  8  the
   Judge clearly had evidence before him. Therefore I  have  looked  at  the
   correspondence in the file to try and determine what evidence  he  relied
   on as it is not set out in the decision .I note that this  correspondence
   includes the letter of 2 August 2016 in which the Appellant puts his case
   that at the time of application, 16 February 2016, his partner  was  self
   employed as a cleaner having previously been a job  seeker  and  that  in
   addition from June 2016 she  was  a  freelance  interpreter  with  D.  A.
   Languages. There is also in addition  a  letter  dated  24  October  2016
   referring to the previous letter of 2 August  and  submitting  additional
   evidence of 3 months  of  bank  statements  for  the  period  June  2016-
   September 2016.
18. The challenge in the grounds  is  that  the  Judge  did  not  take  into
   account the evidence submitted with the letter of 2/8/16. I am  satisfied
   this challenge is not made out. The fact that the evidence was not in the
   Respondents bundle was immaterial as it was in the Tribunals file.  I  am
   satisfied not only that the Judge had before him the letter of  2  August
   and its enclosures and  the  further  letter  of  24  October  2016  with
   statements for the period 18 June 2016 to 17 September 2016 but  that  he
   took them into account. I am satisfied that  the  Judge  took  them  into
   account because they were the only evidence  before  the  Judge  that  he
   could possibly have used to set out the Appellants case in the absence of
   a Respondents bundle referring as he does to evidence that post dates the
   date of the Appellants application  that  was  set  out  in  the  refusal
   letter.
19. Moreover on the basis of the evidence contained within  the  letters  of
   2/8 and 24/10 the Judge was entitled to come to the  conclusion  that  he
   did that the evidence to support the Appellants claim  was  insufficient.
   The Judge summarises the Appellants case at paragraph 8 to  be  that  the
   sponsor had been working since February 2016 and specifically that emails
   showed she 'had been booked as an  interpreter  on  approximately  twenty
   occasions between August and September 2016'  and  noted  that  the  bank
   statements did not reflect this: in fact  the  bank  statements  for  the
   period June to September 2016 that he  had  before  him  shows  only  one
   payment from D A Languages  from 5 September 2016 of ï¿½165  .There  is  no
   corresponding invoice even if the Judge had had  the  Respondents  bundle
   and no evidence of the other 19 occasions that the Appellant asserts that
   he worked for DA Languages.

20. The Appellant attended court with a receipt book for  the  Sponsor  that
   he claimed showed the work she had done but there  is  no  evidence  that
   this was ever submitted to the Tribunal indeed there is no  reference  to
   that receipt book in any of the letters submitted to the court.

21. It is also  argued  that  the  Judge  did  not  take  into  account  the
   Appellants claim that the Sponsor worked as a cleaner. The Judge makes no
   reference to this in his findings at paragraphs  7  and  8  although  the
   Appellant relied on it in the applications and the  letters  of  2/8  and
   24/10. However I am satisfied that it could  not  have  made  a  material
   difference as the  same  evidential  shortcomings  apply.  The  Appellant
   claimed that the Sponsor had worked as a cleaner from February  2016  but
   there was no  evidence  of  receipts  from  any  customer  and  the  bank
   statements  contain  only  3  payments  attributable   to   cleaning   on
   13/7/16,15/7/16  and 8/8/16. Given the period  for  which  the  Appellant
   claims the Sponsor worked he would have been entitled  to  conclude  that
   the evidence of that work was woefully inadequate.

22. It is a trite observation that a judge need not address in detail  every
   single argument advanced before him,  nor  consider  in  isolation  every
   single piece of evidence. He must weigh all of the evidence  before  him,
   and give clear reasons for his conclusions such that the parties, and  in
   particular the losing party, can understand the reasons for his decision.
   I find that the reasons given were adequate and the Appellant  cannot  be
   in any doubt about why  the  appeal  was  dismissed:  that  the  evidence
   produced did not support the claim that  the  Appellant  worked  for  the
   periods in issue as a cleaner and interpreter.



CONCLUSION

23. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established  and  that
   the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

24. The appeal is dismissed.
