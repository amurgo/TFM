    Representation:
                            For the Appellant: Mr S Randhawa a
           solicitor from Sky Solicitors
          For the Respondent: Mr Hyde Jarvis a Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 23  April  1982.
    He has been given permission to appeal the determination of  First-Tier
    Tribunal Judge Callow ("the FTTJ") who dismissed his appeal against the
    respondent's decision of 21 May 2013 to refuse to grant  him  leave  to
    remain in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under the Points-
    based System and to give directions for his removal under section 47 of
    the Immigration and Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


 2. The appellant had been a student in the UK since 16 May  2009.  He  was
    last granted leave to remain in this capacity on 16 January 2012 for  a
    period expiring on 1 June 2013. This leave was granted to enable him to
    undertake a course of study at London College of Business Management  &
    Information Technology ("London  College").  London  College's  Tier  4
    licence was suspended by the respondent. The appellant  enrolled  on  a
    course of study at Maryland College. On 3 April  2013  he  applied  for
    further leave to remain as a student to study at Queensbury College  on
    a course leading to the award of a Diploma in Health Care Management.


 3. The respondent considered the application and awarded the appellant the
    required 30 points for the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)
    and 10 points for Maintenance  (Funds).  However  the  application  was
    refused for the following reasons


        "Where a Tier 4 Student Migrant made a  successful  application  for
        leave to remain on or after  5  October  2009,  Section  50  of  the
        Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 prohibits that student
        from study other than at the institution that  the  Confirmation  of
        Acceptance for Studies Checking Service  records  as  the  student's
        Sponsor. If you choose to study at another institution that holds  a
        different sponsor licence number to the institution  where  you  are
        granted leave  to  remain  to  study  at,  you  must  make  a  fresh
        application for leave to remain. If you switch to studying at a Tier
        4 Sponsor that holds Highly Trusted  status  you  may  commence  the
        course  of  study  while  you  await  the  outcome  of  your   fresh
        application, providing that application was submitted whilst you had
        extent leave to remain.


        You were last granted leave based on a successful  application  made
        on 13 November 2011 for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
        Student Migrant to study with London College of Business  Management
        and IT until 1 June 2013.


        In view of the fact that you have submitted evidence of  studying  a
        Postgraduate Diploma in Information System -  Level  7  at  Maryland
        College London  from  23  January  2011  to  24  January  2013,  the
        Secretary of State is not satisfied that you have complied with  the
        conditions attached to your leave to remain.


        Therefore you do not satisfy the requirements for this category  and
        it has been decided to refuse your application for leave  to  remain
        as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under  paragraph  322(3)  with
        reference to 245ZY(c)(iv) of the Immigration Rules".


 4. The appellant appealed and the FTTJ heard his appeal on 24 March and 26
    June 2014. Both parties were represented, the appellant by Mr  Randhawa
    who appears before us. At the first hearing the FTTJ refused to admit a
    s120 Statement of Additional Grounds in which the  appellant  made  the
    additional claim for leave to remain as the  spouse  of  his  wife  and
    sponsor Bahar Rasool. However, having heard  submissions  and  reserved
    his determination  the  FTTJ  reconsidered  the  application  and  then
    reconvened  the  hearing.  At  the  adjourned  hearing  he  admitted  a
    Statement of Additional Grounds by which the appellant claimed leave to
    remain in the UK as the spouse of his sponsor under the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


 5. The FTTJ heard evidence from the appellant and his wife. After  hearing
    submissions he reserved his determination.


 6. In relation to the student appeal the FTTJ found that with effect  from
    1  October  2009  the  Rules  were  amended  so  that  under  paragraph
    245ZY(c)(1) students were restricted to studying  at  their  sponsoring
    institutions.  Any  student  who  wanted  to  do  anything  more   than
    "supplementary study" at a different institution had to apply  to  vary
    their leave. Failure to do so would amount to failure to comply with  a
    condition attached to the grant of leave to enter or remain  and  would
    normally lead to refusal under paragraph 322(3).


 7. The FTTJ found that the appellant was ignorant of  this  provision  and
    failed to make an application to study at Maryland College.  He  should
    have made an application vary his  leave  to  remain  once  he  stopped
    studying at London College and decided to study at Maryland College. In
    these circumstances he was not entitled to  rely  on  the  respondent's
    evidential flexibility policy which related to errors or  omissions  in
    specified documents. The FTTJ found that there was no  common-law  duty
    of fairness which required the respondent to inform the appellant.


 8. The FTTJ dismissed the student appeal under the Immigration  Rules.  He
    went on to consider the appellant's Article 8 private life  claim.  The
    appellant did not meet any of the requirements of  paragraph  276ADE(1)
    and there were no arguably good grounds for granting leave on the basis
    of compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
    Rules. However, in case he was mistaken in that  conclusion,  the  FTTJ
    went on to address the Article  8  private  life  grounds  outside  the
    Rules, applying Razgar principles. He concluded  that  this  Article  8
    claim and appeal failed.


 9. In relation to the claim for leave to remain  as  a  spouse,  the  FTTJ
    addressed the financial requirements of the Rules. The appellant needed
    to show by way of specified evidence from the required sources that  he
    had a gross annual income of at least �18,600 plus  another  �3800  for
    the first child. It was common ground that as the appellant had a  wife
    and stepchild he needed to show a gross income of at least �22,400  and
    at best he had shown that he had �18,370.


10. The FTTJ considered the Article 8 human rights requirements of Appendix
    FM. The appellant had to show that he met the requirements at the  date
    of the application. The FTTJ found that the date of application was  18
    March 2014 which was the date of the  appellant's  first  Statement  of
    Additional Grounds for leave to remain as a spouse. He did not meet the
    requirements of E-ECP.3.1 because his income and  that  of  his  spouse
    fell short of the required �22,400 by �4030. It  had  not  been  argued
    that the provisions of EX.1. (a) or (b) applied.


11. The FTTJ found that  there  were  contact  proceedings  in  the  Family
    Division of the High Court between the appellant's wife and her  former
    husband relating to their daughter (the appellant's stepdaughter) which
    meant that if the appellant was  removed  from  the  UK  his  wife  and
    stepdaughter would not be able to accompany him.  The  FTTJ  considered
    the opinions of the House of Lords in  Chikwamba  [2008]  UKHL  40  and
    other  authorities  before  concluding  that  the  appellant  could  be
    required to return to Pakistan to make an entry clearance  application.
    To do so would not simply be a matter of policy but a  reflection  that
    the appellant's student application had failed and he did not meet  the
    financial requirements of the Rules for leave to remain  as  a  spouse.
    There would be a public interest purpose in  discouraging  others  from
    circumventing the entry clearance requirements and system.


12. The FTTJ dismissed the appeals.


13. The appellant applied for and was granted permission to appeal.  It  is
    submitted that there are material errors of law.


14. Firstly, the FTTJ erred in  law  by  finding  that  the  appellant  was
    required to make an application to study with Maryland College  because
    he had not stopped studying with London College. He  had  continued  to
    study with London College even though its licence had  been  suspended.
    His studies with London College were an  "extra/supplementary  course".
    When, by March 2013, the Tier 4 licence of London College had not  been
    reinstated or revoked the appellant decided to change  his  sponsor  in
    order to pursue a course of studies at Queensbury College.


15.  Secondly,  the  FTTJ  misinterpreted  the  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM. Because the appellant had a stepchild who  was  a  British
    citizen she did not fall within the definition of a "child"  in  E-LTPR
    3.1. The appellant did not have to establish that he had an  additional
    �3800. All that he had to show was �18,600.


16. Thirdly, the FTTJ miscalculated the gross annual income required in the
    light of the documentary  evidence  submitted  by  the  appellant.  The
    decision was based on the P60s showing the appellant's annual income to
    be �11,500 and his wife's to be �6870. Under paragraph 13  of  Appendix
    FM-SE as his wife had been in employment for more than six months  with
    her current employer her annual income should have been  calculated  on
    the basis of her average monthly salary over the last six  months.  The
    appellant received  a  salary  of  �6500  in  the  six  months  between
    September 2013 and February 2014 which equated to  �13,000  per  annum.
    His wife received a salary of �4940 in the six months between September
    2013 and February 2014 which equated to �9880 per annum.  Between  them
    they had shown a gross annual income of �22,800. The FTTJ also erred by
    assuming that section 85A(4) applied.  The  application  for  leave  to
    remain under Appendix FM was not governed by the Points Based System.


17. Fourthly, the FTTJ erred in law in paragraph 35 by stating that it  had
    not been argued or shown that EX.1(b) of Appendix  FM  applied  in  the
    light of the  evidence  as  the  family  proceedings  relating  to  the
    appellant's stepdaughter. The fact  that  the  stepdaughter  could  not
    leave the UK meant that there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    appellant and his wife continuing their family life outside the UK. The
    ground should have been considered under EX.1(b) of Appendix FM.


18. Fifthly, the FTTJ misdirected  himself  in  his  consideration  of  the
    principles in Chikwamba. There would be no circumvention of  the  entry
    clearance system where the appellant, as a Tier 4 Migrant was  entitled
    to switch and apply for leave as a spouse whilst in the UK.


19. Mr Randhawa relied on the grounds of appeal. In reply to  our  question
    he accepted that there was no evidence from the  appellant  as  to  how
    much time he spent studying at Maryland College. He submitted that  the
    appellant had gone on studying full-time at London College whilst doing
    an "extra" course at Maryland College.


20. Following a discussion between Mr Randhawa and Mr Jarvis in relation to
    the second ground of  appeal,  Mr  Jarvis  accepted  that  because  the
    appellant had a stepchild who was a British citizen she  did  not  fall
    within the definition of a "child" in E-LTPR 3.1. The appellant did not
    have to establish that he had an additional �3800. All that he  had  to
    show was �18,600.


21. Mr Randhawa accepted that the FTTJ reached the  correct  conclusion  in
    paragraph 37 "that should the appellant be removed from the UK his wife
    and stepchild will be unable to accompany him" but  not  the  route  by
    which he arrived at it. Perhaps surprisingly in the light of the  fifth
    ground of appeal is submitted that Chikwamba was irrelevant.


22. Mr Jarvis submitted that in considering whether there  were  errors  of
    law we needed to take into account how the appeal was put to the  FTTJ.
    Mr Randhawa was making submissions  both  as  a  representative  and  a
    witness. This was not permissible. Allegations as to what  was  put  to
    the FTTJ at the hearing should have been included  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal, a request made for the FTTJ's record  of  proceedings  and  the
    opportunity given to the FTTJ to comment on the  allegations.  None  of
    this had been done. The FTTJ had to deal with the case as it was put to
    him.  The  grounds  of  appeal  which  fell  foul  of  this  procedural
    irregularity were those relating to the financial threshold,  paragraph
    7(d) and EX1 (a) and (b) in paragraph 35.


23. In relation to the first ground of appeal, Mr Jarvis submitted that the
    appellant's evidence as to what  colleges  he  attended  and  when  was
    unclear. Neither the evidence before the FTT nor the  submissions  made
    to him showed that the appellant's attendance at Maryland College  came
    within the required exception.


24. As to the second ground, Mr Jarvis accepted that because the  appellant
    had a stepchild who was a British citizen she did not fall  within  the
    definition of a "child" in E-LTPR 3.1. The appellant did  not  have  to
    establish that he had an additional �3800. All that he had to show  was
    �18,600. However, this was not a point put to the FTTJ.


25. The point raised in the third ground of appeal as to taking the average
    of the lowest monthly salary over a six-month period had not  been  put
    to the FTTJ. One of the issues in relation to this basis of calculation
    was to decide the date of the application as  the  starting  point  for
    calculating the six-month period. No marriage application had been made
    to the respondent and it was raised for the first time before the FTTJ.
    In these circumstances it was not clear what  the  starting  date  was.
    However, the appellant failed in any event because  he  had  failed  to
    provide the required letters  from  the  employers,  the  contracts  of
    employment  or  the  linked  bank  statements.  The  evidence  in   the
    appellant's bundle did not comply with these requirements.


26. As to the fourth ground, EX1 was not freestanding provision. There were
    a number of possible routes into it none of which  were  argued  before
    the FTTJ. All the requirements had to be met and it was  not  suggested
    to the FTTJ that this had been done. EX1 only came into effect under R-
    LTPR d (1) (iii). Even if the appellant managed to get this far it  had
    not been argued that  there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship.


27. In relation to the fifth ground, the FTTJ  relied  on  Chikwamba  which
    favoured  the  appellant.  This  was  a  case  where  the   maintenance
    requirements were not met and EX1 was not argued.


28. In reply Mr Randhawa drew attention to paragraph 7 of the determination
    in which the FTTJ set out the appellant's case. He  accepted  that  the
    P60s showed an income of less  than  �18,600  and  that  no  employer's
    letter or contract of employment had been  submitted.  These  were  now
    available but post-dated the hearing before the FTTJ. In reply  to  our
    question, Mr Randhawa accepted that the EX1 point was not  put  to  the
    FTTJ, although he suggested that this might have been deduced from what
    was said in the witness statements. It would be unduly harsh to  expect
    the appellant to leave the UK.


29. We reserved our determination.


30. A major difficulty facing the appellant is that the case variously  set
    out in the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal or argued before  us
    differs in a number of important respects from  the  case  put  to  the
    FTTJ. The course of  action  which  those  representing  the  appellant
    should have followed if they considered that the determination did  not
    properly record the submissions made to the FTTJ, the concessions  made
    or facts agreed was to spell these out in  detail  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, ask that these be put to the FTTJ for his
    comments and also  ask  that  he  produce  a  legible/typed  record  of
    proceedings. This would also have given the respondent the  opportunity
    to produce any notes prepared by her counsel at the  hearing.  None  of
    this was done.


31. We find that the FTTJ could not have erred in law in  relation  to  any
    legal argument not put to him either in writing  or  oral  submissions,
    any concession subsequently withdrawn or any evidence of which  he  was
    unaware. The only possible exception would be in relation to  a  matter
    so obvious that it should not have been overlooked. In an  appeal  such
    as this, addressing extremely complicated provisions, we  can  find  no
    element which comes within this category.


32. In relation to the first ground of appeal relating to  the  appellant's
    possible concurrent studies the FTTJ found, in paragraphs 4  and  6(b),
    that the appellant did not pursue  his  course  of  studies  at  London
    College because the College's Tier  4  licence  was  suspended  by  the
    respondent. As a result he enrolled on a comparable course of study  at
    Maryland College  which  he  successfully  completed.  In  his  witness
    statement dated 18 March 2014  the  appellant  referred  to  "parallel"
    studies but did not say that he  continued  with  the  full  course  at
    London College. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal submit that
    the appellant never stopped studying at London  College  and  that  the
    course at Maryland College was an  "extra/supplementary  course".  This
    ground fails to identify any material error of law. The  argument  that
    the appellant was entitled to benefit from the provision  in  paragraph
    313 of the Tier 4 policy guidance was never put to the FTTJ. Even if it
    had been the evidence before the FTTJ would not have  established  that
    the studies at Maryland College were an "extra" course  which  did  not
    get in the way of his continuing studies at London  College.  Even  now
    the evidence before us does not show this. There are bare assertions in
    the grounds of appeal unsupported by any further witness  statement  or
    documentary evidence from the  appellant  covering,  for  example,  the
    hours and regularity of the  two  courses  which  he  claimed  to  have
    attended during the same period and how he managed to do this.


33. The ground  of  appeal  that  the  FTTJ  misinterpreted  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM because the appellant had a  stepchild  who
    was a British citizen who thus did not fall within the definition of  a
    "child" in E-LTPR 3.1 and accordingly the appellant  did  not  have  to
    establish that he had an additional �3800 was not put to the  FTTJ.  It
    is not an obvious point. However, Mr Jarvis now concedes that  this  is
    correct.


34. The argument that the FTTJ should have calculated  the  income  of  the
    appellant and his wife on the basis of six-month average  income  based
    on the lowest monthly pay in the  six  months  preceding  the  date  of
    application rather than on the basis of their P60s was not  one  relied
    on or even suggested to the FTTJ. On the contrary, the FTTJ recorded in
    paragraph 7(d) that "Mr Randhawa  acknowledged  that  the  P60s  showed
    gross  income  lower  than  �18,600  but  that  the  appellant   should
    nonetheless be granted leave to remain as  a  spouse  under  the  Rules
    failing which, as the appellant clearly established  family  life,  his
    appeal should be allowed under Article 8". In  paragraph  32  the  FTTJ
    said "It is common cause in this appeal that the appellant (as he has a
    stepchild in addition to his wife) is  required  to  show  a  specified
    gross annual income of at least �22,400, and that at best  the  party's
    annual income amounts to only �18,370".


35. Even if the point had been argued before  the  FTTJ  and  even  if  the
    appellant had been able to establish  that  the  six  months'  payslips
    showed the correct amounts during the  required  period  the  appellant
    would have failed because under  Appendix  FM-SE  and  in  relation  to
    salaried employment in the UK he was required to provide  letters  from
    the employers and signed contracts of employment. Mr Randhawa  concedes
    that these were not before the FTTJ and  were  not  available  at  that
    time.


36. In relation to the fourth ground which submits that the FTTJ  erred  in
    law in paragraph 35 by stating that it had not  been  argued  or  shown
    that EX.1(b) of Appendix FM applied in the light of the evidence as the
    family proceedings relating to the  appellant's  stepdaughter  we  find
    that the FTTJ was correct to say that the point had not been argued. We
    agree with Mr Jarvis's  submission  that  EX1  is  not  a  freestanding
    provision. It is  complicated  and  there  are  a  number  of  possible
    alternative routes into it, in this case through  section  R-LTPR.  The
    appellant did not put forward any argument that these  provisions  were
    met and even now there are  no  detailed  submissions  as  to  how  the
    provisions might be satisfied.


37. We find no error in the  FTTJ's  consideration  of  the  principles  in
    Chikwamba. On the authorities to which he referred it was open  to  him
    to  find  that  the  application  of  the  principles  depended  on  an
    assessment of the particular facts. This  was  not  a  case  where  the
    appellant would be required to return to Pakistan merely  in  order  to
    satisfy policy requirements but where he had failed both in his  appeal
    for leave to remain as a student and for leave to remain as a spouse.


38. The FTTJ did not make an anonymity direction. We have not been asked to
    make such a direction and can see no good reason to do so.


39. We  find  that  the  FTTJ  did  not  err  in  law  and  we  uphold  his
    determination.

 Upper Tribunal Judge Moulden
