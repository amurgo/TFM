                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT


 1. The appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan  of  born  2  April  1981.  He
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary
    of State of 31 January 2014, refusing to vary his leave to remain.  The
    First-tier Tribunal dismissed this appeal in a determination  following
    a hearing on  30  October  2014.  Judge  Doyle  granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. By way of an email to  the  Upper  Tribunal  dated  20  July  2015  the
    appellant requests permission to withdraw the appellant's appeal before
    the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    I give consent to the appellant to withdraw his case.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.

Upper Tribunal Judge D E Taylor
