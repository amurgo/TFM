                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by Omolara Basheedat Ipaye and her son Oluwisimi A T
    Adepoju against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Thanki
    following a hearing at Richmond on the 13th May 2014.  In a
    determination promulgated on the 3rd June 2014 their application to
    remain in the UK outside the Rules pursuant to article 8 and under
    section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act of 2009 was
    rejected for the reasons given in the determination.

 2. The complaint made about the determination is that the Judge had placed
    too much weight on the previous determination from January 2012 and had
    failed to take into account that the second Appellant was by the date
    of the hearing 7 years old and fell within the scope of paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  It was submitted that there needed to
    be anxious scrutiny which was lacking and that his best interests under
    section 55 of the 2009 Act would demand that he and his mother be
    allowed to remain.

 3. It is clear from the record set out within the determination that the
    Judge had in mind section 55, article 8 and also paragraph 276ADE.  He
    also received evidence relating to both the first Appellant, the
    medical situation of her mother and what she had to say about the
    educational system that would be available to them on return to Nigeria
    with the observation that she could not afford to pay for her son's
    education.

 4. There is an error in the determination because the Judge appears to
    proceed on the footing that is set out in the submission section that
    private life only begins after the age of 4.  That is incorrect.
    Private life begins from the moment of entry into the UK.  Whether or
    not the seven years is measured by birth or entry is irrelevant.  There
    is, however, clear authority to the effect that the first four years
    carry less weight because in those years a child is more heavily
    focused on the family and it is only once they start to attend formal
    education that a private life in the wider sense begins to develop.

 5. However, the requirement under paragraph 276ADE is that not only has
    the child been in the UK for seven years but that it would not be
    reasonable to expect them to return to their country of nationality.

 6. Mr Ren� in succinct and helpful submissions has referred to the case of
    Tinizaray in paragraph 16 referring to the decision-maker's duty to
    safeguard and promote the welfare of children and to prevent the
    impairment of their development.  The argument essentially is that to
    take him out of the UK educational system at this stage would impair
    his progress such that section 55 would be breached.

 7. Against that submission there are several points which are reflected in
    the decision of the Supreme Court in Zoumbas, and I quote from
    paragraph 24:

         "There is no irrationality in the conclusion that it was in the
         children's best interests to go with their parents to the Republic
         of Congo.  No doubt it would have been possible to have stated
         that, other things being equal, it was in the best interests of the
         children that they and their parents stayed in the United Kingdom
         so that they could obtain such benefits as healthcare and education
         which the decision-maker recognised might be of a higher standard
         than would be available in the Congo.  But other things were not
         equal.  They were not British citizens.  They had no right to
         future education and healthcare in this country.  They were part of
         a close-knit family with highly educated parents and were of an age
         when their emotional needs could only be fully met within the
         immediate family unit."

 8. I appreciate that the parents in the case of Zoumbas had what was
    described in the decision as an unedifying immigration history but
    their situation is not markedly different from that of the Appellants
    in this case.  The first Appellant entered the UK herself with no
    expectation of being permitted to remain and having stated an intention
    to return to Nigeria and it was obvious that this stage would come,
    besides which she has overstayed for two years since the January 2012
    determination.

 9. Although the Judge approached or appears to have approached the
    position from a starting point which may not be correct I am satisfied
    in fact that paragraph 40 shows that he properly approached the issues
    in substance.  At paragraph 40 he said:

         "In the appeal before me the new Rules in relation to family and
         private life rights are engaged and fully considered by the
         Respondent.  Neither Appellant qualifies under Appendix FM.  As to
         private life rights they did not qualify under paragraph 276ADE
         either.  If I find that there are exceptional circumstances in
         their case and consider the five step analysis Razgar as considered
         and analysed by the previous determination I would reach no
         different conclusion.  First, the second Appellant's position under
         section 55 has been fully considered.  He will remain with his
         mother which is what is required for any dependent child in order
         to have a full and meaningful life.  There is nothing indicated to
         suggest that he would not be able to receive adequate education in
         Nigeria."

    That finding is not challenged.

10. Accordingly I find that read overall the Judge did consider, albeit
    that he did not state his position as accurately as he could or should,
    all of the factors that he had to.  The determination shows a proper
    line of reasoning.  There is no error and the determination to the
    Upper Tribunal is dismissed and the First-tier Tribunal's determination
    stands.
