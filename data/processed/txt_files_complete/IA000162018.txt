                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Bartlett promulgated on the 2nd  October2018  the  judge
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent
    to refuse the appellant further leave to remain in the UK as a  Tier  4
    Student and thereafter leave based on Article 8 of the ECHR  rights  to
    family and private life.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it
    necessary to do so.

 3. Leave to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Lambert on 22nd October 2018.  Thus  the  case  appeared
    before me to determine whether or not there was a material error of law
    in the decision.

 4. The material part of the grant of leave provides:-

         3. The grounds take issue with the appeal having  been  listed  for
         oral hearing after the appellant had requested it to be  considered
         on the papers. The file records that this has been confirmed by the
         Tribunal on the 17th September. The real issue is whether the judge
         was in the circumstances entitled, the appeal having  been  listed,
         to  proceed  to  hear  submissions  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent
         (paragraph 2). There is arguable merit in the contention that doing
         so gave rise  to  unfairness  to  the  Appellant  whether  real  or
         perceived and amounted to a procedural error amounting to an  error
         of law.

    Factual background

 5. The appellant entered the UK on 15th January 2010 with leave valid as a
    student until 24th October 2011. On 5th October 2012 the appellant  was
    granted further leave as a student until 13th October 2014.

 6. On 26th July 2013 the appellant made a further application for leave to
    remain as a student on the basis  of  a  CAS  issued  by  London  Regal
    College.   On  the  20th  January  2015  the  respondent  informed  the
    appellant that the licence of London Regal College  had  been  revoked.
    The appellant was given 60 days to obtain an alternative sponsor.

 7.  By  the  time  of  the  notification  the  appellant's  English   test
    certificate was no longer  valid  and  the  appellant  required  a  new
    English-language test certificate before he could apply for a CAS.  The
    appellant in order to sit the test required his passport which was with
    the respondent.  The  respondent  provided  a  certified  copy  of  the
    passport but the appellant at that stage could  only  book  an  English
    language test outside the 60 days on the 18th  April  2016.  Ultimately
    the appellant was not permitted to sit the English Language test as  he
    only had a certified copy of his passport and not the original.

 8. By that  stage  the  appellant  was  outside  the  60  day  period  for
    submission of a valid  CAS  to  support  the  existing  application.  A
    decision was made to refuse the appellant's application. The  appellant
    appealed. Ultimately by decision of the Upper Tribunal the  appellant's
    appeal was allowed as it was  accepted  that  the  appellant  had  been
    prevented from taking an appropriate English language test by reason of
    the respondent retaining the appellant's passport.

 9. In paragraph 8 of the decision by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Pitt  it  is
    suggested that the respondent should allow the appellant a  further  60
    days "with the benefit of his original passport" in order to  obtain  a
    new sponsor and CAS. The decision by Judge Pitt is dated  5th  December
    2016.

10. By decision of 22  December  2017  the  respondent  again  refused  the
    appellant leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  student  or
    otherwise on the basis of Article 8 family and private life and made  a
    decision to remove the appellant by way of directions under section  47
    of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

11. The  appellant  appealed  against  the  respondent's  decision  and  as
    indicated the appeal was heard by Judge Bartlett on 18 September  2018.
    By decision dated  20  September  2018  Judge  Bartlett  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal.

12. It is against that appeal that the appellant now seeks to appeal.

    Grounds of appeal

13. In challenging the decision of the judge the appellant has  raised  the
    following grounds

      a) The appeal was to be listed as an oral hearing. By request made  on
         13 September 2018 the appellant requested that the case be heard on
         the papers. The First-tier Tribunal  confirmed  in  writing  on  17
         September that the case would be heard on the papers. Despite  that
         the case was heard in an oral hearing  on  18  September  2018.  In
         conducting  an  oral  hearing  it  is  submitted  that  there   was
         unfairness to the appellant and the decision ought to be set aside.
         Reliance is placed on the case of MM  (Unfairness;  E  &  R)  Sudan
         [2014] UKUT 00105. [E & R is a reference to the case of  E  &  R  v
         SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 49.

      b) The 2nd issue taken was the fact that the respondent had failed  to
         cooperate and provide the  appellant's  original  passport  thereby
         preventing the appellant from taking the required  English-language
         test or from obtaining a CAS.

      c) In assessing article 8 it is submitted that the judge has erred  in
         concluding that little weight has to be given to the  private  life
         established by the appellant in the UK. Given  that  the  appellant
         had been in the United Kingdom with lawful residence  for  9  years
         article 8 was clearly engaged and the judge has failed to  consider
         such properly.

      d) The judge has failed properly to assess the appellant's family life
         with his Estonian  fianc�e.  The  judge  states  that  very  little
         information has been given not even the name  of  the  fianc�e  and
         family life is not mentioned in the skeleton argument. Submitted at
         paragraph 3  of  the  appellant's  witness  statement  is  a  clear
         reference to the fianc�e.  No  credibility  findings  are  made  in
         respect of the appellant's detailed witness statement.

    Error of law

14. At the outset of the hearing before me the  appellant's  representative
    withdrew the 2nd ground of appeal. The respondent's representative  had
    disclosed correspondence between the appellant and his solicitor on one
    side and the respondent on the other, in which it was  clear  that  the
    original passport had in fact  been  provided  to  the  appellant.  The
    respondent had clearly  been  in  touch  with  the  appellant  and  his
    representative as required by the Upper  Tribunal  direction.   It  was
    accepted in the circumstances that the 2nd ground  of  appeal  was  not
    made out.

15. The appellant's representative in dealing with the 1st ground of appeal
    placed great reliance upon  paragraph  10  of  the  decision  of  Judge
    Bartlett. In paragraph 10 the judge had referred  to  the  respondent's
    representative having submitted a written skeleton argument.  There  is
    no copy of that skeleton argument on the court file. The representative
    for the respondent was also unable to find a copy of any  such  written
    skeleton argument on the Home Office file. There was no record  of  any
    such skeleton argument having been submitted beforehand.  There  is  no
    reference to a skeleton argument in the decision itself other  than  in
    paragraph 10.

16. The appellant's representative accepted that if  no  skeleton  argument
    had  been  submitted  then  the  mere  fact   that   the   respondent's
    representative at the hearing had relied upon the refusal letter  would
    make no difference to the proceedings as no matter not  already  before
    the First-tier Tribunal and the appellant was being relied upon by  the
    respondent.

17. The respondent's representative was arguing that paragraph  10  of  the
    decision was clearly a typographical error and that  the  judge  should
    have referred to skeleton argument  that  had  been  submitted  by  the
    appellant.  There  is  a  reference  to  a  skeleton  argument  by  the
    appellant's representative in the decision at paragraph 13. There is no
    reference anywhere in the decision otherwise  to  a  skeleton  argument
    submitted by the respondent's representative.

18. I asked the appellant's representative why I should not deal  with  the
    appeal on the basis of the documentation lodged if I found  that  there
    was an error by listing the matter as an oral hearing and by reason  of
    permitting the appellant's representative to submit skeleton  argument.
    The appellant's representative could give no good reason why  I  should
    not deal with the appeal on the basis of the documentation lodged.

19. In that respect the skeleton argument submitted by  the  appellant  was
    seeking to argue that

      a) on 2 June 2017, 6 months after the decision of the Upper  Tribunal,
         the respondent had written to the appellant issuing another 60  day
         letter, requiring the appellant to obtain a  valid  CAS  within  60
         days.

      b) by letter the appellant had written  on  22  June  2017  requesting
         further assistance as he was finding it difficult to  find  college
         that would provide him with a valid CAS.

      c) on the 26 June 2017 the respondent refused to provide an  extension
         to the appellant. In the skeleton argument it is alleged that  that
         was despite the direction by the  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  that  the
         respondent   should   liaise    with    the    appellant's    legal
         representatives,  the  respondent  had  not  liaised  as  required.
         (Clearly given the correspondence that could not be maintained).

      d) on the 29th July 2017 asserting that the documentation provided  by
         the respondent was generic in nature, the solicitors  were  seeking
         to argue that the appellant an innocent student had been  prevented
         from studying as he could not find a college to  providing  with  a
         valid CAS.

      e) It is sought to be argued that this is unfair and  ultimately  that
         the refusal of 20 December without replying to the  letter  of  the
         29th July and without taking account of the direction by the  Upper
         Tribunal was unfair to the appellant.

20. The appellant had entered  on  a  temporary  basis  as  a  student  and
    required a valid CAS to be able to extend his leave. The respondent had
    provided the passport. It was then a matter for the appellant to obtain
    any necessary English-language test certificate and to obtain  a  valid
    CAS. The appellant had had ample opportunity to do so. It is clear from
    the fact that there was correspondence that the respondent had done all
    within his power  to  facilitate  the  appellant  taking  the  English-
    language test and applying to colleges for a valid CAS.

21. From the original date of the application 2013 the  appellant  had  had
    over 4 years in which to obtain the necessary qualifications  and  CAS.
    Even if one discounts the initial period, the appellant  had  had  from
    the decision of the Upper Tribunal in December 2016 until the  date  of
    the respondent's letter of 2 June 2017  but  even  by  that  stage  the
    appellant still had not obtained  a  CAS.  Thereafter  from  that  date
    through to the date of decision by the respondent in December 2017  the
    appellant had not obtained a valid CAS.

22. By the hearing before Judge Bartlett on the  18th  September  2018  the
    appellant still had not obtained a valid CAS.  The  appellant  had  had
    more than enough time to obtain a valid CAS and had not  done  so.  The
    appellant seeks to argue that it is unfair and that he should have been
    given more time. As found by Judge  Bartlett  the  appellant  had  been
    given more than sufficient time and did not have a CAS. Judge  Bartlett
    has carefully examined the facts and given valid  reasons  for  finding
    that the appellant had had more than sufficient time to obtain a  valid
    CAS.

23. Even if there were procedural  unfairness  and  the  decision  for  the
    reasons set out was set aside, I would have found  that  the  appellant
    had had more than sufficient time to obtain a new CAS but had not  done
    so and he could not meet the requirements of the rules  as  a  student.



24. Judge Bartlett was under the impression that the appellant had not been
    furnished with his passport as is evident from paragraph  16  but  that
    was clearly not the case given the correspondence  that  has  now  been
    produced by the respondent's representative.

25. Dealing with the issues the case law cited requires that there be  that
    not only a procedural error but that there be resultant unfairness.  In
    the circumstances presented I do not  find  that  there  has  been  any
    unfairness.

26. For the sake of completeness I have to say that there being no copy  of
    any  written  submissions  or  skeleton  argument  on  behalf  of   the
    respondent on file or on the  Home  Office  file  that  there  being  a
    skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant and willing to accept that
    there was a typographical error and the judge was seeking to  refer  to
    skeleton argument submitted by the  appellant  not  the  respondent  in
    paragraph 10 of the decision.

27. Even if I were to find that  there  was  a  procedural  error  I  would
    therefore not have found that there was any unfairness. Even  if  there
    had been unfairness and I had to reconsider the case, I would find that
    the appellant had been given every opportunity to obtain  a  valid  CAS
    but had not done  so.  The  appellant  therefore  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of  the  rules  in  any  event  as  a  student.  In  those
    circumstances even if I had found that there  was  a  procedural  error
    constituting an error of law I would have gone on  to  remake  decision
    and find that the appellant could not  succeed  under  the  immigration
    rules as a student.

28. Turning to the other grounds of  appeal,  grounds  3,  the  appellant's
    representative seeks to argue the judge has erred  into  assessing  the
    article 8 rights of the appellant. In the bundle of documents submitted
    by the appellant is a statement from page 1 onwards. In the  main  that
    statement deals with the problems that the appellant has experienced in
    seeking to obtain a CAS. The only reference to  any  other  aspects  of
    private life within that relate to  his  relationship  to  his  alleged
    girlfriend, [KM], an Estonian national.

29. With regard to his relationship the  appellant  indicates  that  he  is
    living with the lady and suggest that they have been together nearly  2
    years. He does not give any details for the start of the  relationship;
    he claims that the lady is working at Ivy Collection; and that  she  is
    supporting him. He claims that  they  intend  to  marry.  There  is  no
    statement from [KM]. There is no documentation to confirm that  she  is
    working or supporting the appellant. There is no  evidence  apart  from
    the appellant's assertions that he  is  in  the  relationship  with  an
    Estonian national and being supported.

30. Apart from the relationship no aspect of family  or  private  life  has
    been evidenced in any way. The appellant has relied primarily upon  his
    problems with regard to obtaining CAS. It may be difficult to obtain  a
    CAS, but an individual requires such a document in order to be able  to
    continue studying in the United Kingdom.

31. The respondent's representative has relied upon the case of Patel  2013
    UKSC 72 specifically paragraph 57 wherein Lord Carnwarth states

         "It is important to remember  that  article  8  is  not  a  general
         dispensing. It is to be distinguished from the Secretary of  States
         discretion to allow leave to remain outside the rules, which may be
         unrelated to any protected human rights. The merits of the decision
         not to depart from the rules are not reviewable on appeal:  section
         86 (6). One may sympathise with Sedley LJ's  call  in  Pankina  for
         'common sense' in the application of the rules to graduate to  have
         been studying the United  Kingdom  some  years  (see  paragraph  47
         above). However, such considerations do not by  themselves  provide
         grounds for appeal under article 8, which is concerned with private
         or family life, not  education  as  such.  The  opportunity  for  a
         promising student to complete his course in this  country,  however
         desirable in general terms, is not  in  itself  a  right  protected
         under article 8.

32. In the  present  circumstances  the  appellant  has  been  given  every
    opportunity to seek to obtain a valid CAS and comply  with  the  rules.
    Unfortunate though it is he cannot comply with the rules as  a  student
    and in the circumstances whilst it may be a factor  to  be  taken  into
    consideration it is not of itself such as to give a right under Article
    8.

33. The 4th ground relates to the judge's  assessment  of  the  appellant's
    relationship with his Estonian fianc�e. The suggestion being  that  the
    judge has failed to consider the relationship. As pointed out there  is
    no evidence to support the appellant's claims as  to  the  relationship
    and the fact that the lady is working  and  supporting  the  appellant.
    There is no statement from the fianc�e. There are no  payslips,  rental
    agreements, bills  or  other  evidence  to  support  the  claims  of  a
    relationship. The judge in paragraph 23 in  assessing  whether  or  not
    family  life  existed  found  that   the   information   provided   was
    insufficient to establish that the relationship was such as  to  engage
    family life.  In  the  light  of  the  evidence  produced  that  was  a
    conclusion that the judge was entitled to make on  the  facts.  Further
    whilst the appellant has been  in  the  UK  for  9  years  he  has  not
    otherwise given any evidence as to any significant  aspect  of  private
    life other than his desire to finish his studies. There was a means  by
    which he could complete his studies under the  rules.  Ample  time  has
    been given for him  to  find  a  sponsor.  Accordingly  the  judge  was
    entitled to conclude that there would be no breach of anyone's  private
    life rights.

34. Thus having assessed all of the circumstances and taking account of the
    careful examination of the facts of the present case I  find  that  the
    judge has in paragraph 10 made a typographical error and that there was
    no skeleton argument submitted on behalf  of  the  respondent.  In  the
    light of that a submission that the respondent relied upon the  refusal
    letter and no other submissions being made I find is  not  such  as  to
    give rise to any procedural error and is not such to give rise  to  any
    unfairness.

35. Even if there was procedural unfairness giving rise to an error in law,
    for the reasons set out I  would  in  remaking  the  decision  for  the
    reasons set out above have found that the appellant did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the rules. Further having considered  the  issues  with
    regard to article 8 rights otherwise I find that the decisions taken do
    not breach anyone's rights under article 8 of the ECHR

36. I therefore dismiss the appeal against the decision of  Judge  Bartlett
    on all grounds.

    Notice of Decision

37. I dismiss the appeal on all grounds.
