Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Gilbert instructed by Rahman & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Vietnam.  He appealed to a Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal against the Secretary of  State's  decision  of  24
    July 2018 refusing a claim for asylum and humanitarian protection/leave
    to remain on the basis of Articles 2 and 3 of the  European  Convention
    on Human Rights.

2.   The appellant claimed to be at risk from loan sharks and also from  the
    State for reasons  connected  with  support  for  Catholicism  and  the
    church.

3.   There was at the outset of  the  hearing  before  the  judge  an  issue
    concerning an  adjournment  application.   Counsel  for  the  appellant
    applied for an adjournment for eight weeks for a document  verification
    report to be obtained on a document that had been produced on  the  day
    which was an attachment to an email consisting of a summons  concerning
    the appellant in Vietnam.  It  appeared  that  the  document  had  been
    received on 26 August 2018, a few days before the hearing.   The  judge
    granted a brief adjournment so that  Counsel  could  take  instructions
    about when the document was received by the solicitor and who had  sent
    it, and how it was known that  it  was  needed  and  how  it  had  been
    obtained and how it was sent to the solicitor and  where  the  original
    was.  This resulted in the document being produced through an email  in
    the name of a person who had emailed the document to the solicitor.

4.    The  judge  refused  to  adjourn.   He  appreciated  fully  the  short
    timeframe for the appeal and considered that the points he  had  raised
    were basic points of concern and indicated that he would not promulgate
    a decision for seven days during which time further documents could  be
    sent to him about the purported summons.  No  documents  were  received
    within the seven day period and the judge proceeded  to  determine  the
    appeal.  As will be seen, there is a challenge to the decision based on
    the refusal to adjourn, though we shall come on to that matter  in  due
    course.

5.   The appellant claimed to fear return as he said he  was  at  risk  from
    loan sharks who had lent �80,000 to his father.  He was also in fear of
    return as his father had organised a demonstration and  was  attempting
    to raise funds to  build  a  church  which  the  communist  authorities
    opposed.  He had been sending money to Vietnam to help pay his father's
    debts but the  authorities  thought  the  money  was  sent  to  support
    building the church and as a consequence he said he was now wanted  for
    questioning.  The judge observed that the appellant asserted fear  from
    the loan sharks since 2014 and  had  not  sought  asylum  despite  that
    asserted fear and had been working illegally all  the  time.   He  said
    that this was to enable him to send money back but he had sent money on
    only four occasions, once of �1,000 the other  three  of  lesser  sums,
    �200 to �600.  The judge considered that had he been in genuine fear he
    would have been more likely to have claimed protection both for his own
    sake and so he might work legally and therefore be able  to  send  more
    money.

6.   The judge noted that there was  no  corroboration  of  any  significant
    factor, and, while none was needed for an asylum case, considered  that
    that meant the focus had to be on the account  of  the  appellant.   He
    considered that the account suffered from the assertion  of  fear  from
    loan sharks for years with however no claim being made.  There  was  no
    evidence from the man who he had said had taken money  to  Vietnam  for
    him on two occasions and who obtained the document for him.  There  was
    no reason for this as this person was in the UK, living in Bolton.  The
    appellant had not telephoned him or asked him to attend.

7.   The judge noted that  there  was  also  no  evidence  produced  of  the
    claimed bankruptcy and  considered  that  the  term  implied  a  formal
    process, which had been accepted by the appellant at the  hearing.   On
    the appellant's account the  loan  would  have  featured  in  a  formal
    bankruptcy procedure and the  absence  of  any  information  about  the
    bankruptcy was a point regarded as damaging to credibility.

8.   The judge did not accept that the appellant was genuinely  in  fear  of
    loan sharks.  He had remained in the United Kingdom illegally,  working
    as much as he could.  He had not studied to any significant extent, the
    judge commented, as he was to study English but after five years  spoke
    and read none and the  judge  observed  that  it  was  clear  that  the
    appellant was not using an interpreter  from  caution  but  from  total
    necessity.  He considered it to be clear that the appellant  understood
    little or no English.

9.   The judge observed that the appellant asserted that if he did  not  pay
    them the lenders would harm him, but his brother had  lived  unaffected
    by the debt for the five years since 2014, as the judge put it, and the
    appellant mentioned no threat to his brother from the lenders.

10.  He said he had only found out about the danger a  few  days  before  he
    was encountered and detained by the authorities in the  United  Kingdom
    in May 2018.  His mother had told him that his father  had  disappeared
    and he himself was at risk.  The judge considered this to be  unlikely.



11.  As regards the purported summons, the judge did not find  it  reliable,
    applying the Tanveer Ahmed guidance to it.  On instructions Counsel had
    said that the friend who had obtained it had been to Vietnam to  obtain
    it, but the appellant said the man had been to Thailand on holiday.  It
    was unknown how this person had known a document was needed or  how  he
    had obtained it, and the appellant had spoken to this man on his return
    from holiday on 18 August 2018 but had not asked about it and  had  not
    telephoned him and asked him how he obtained it.  He had not known  the
    man was getting it.  How the document was obtained was unexplained  and
    the man had not been asked to attend the hearing although the solicitor
    had the means of contacting him to ask.  The absence of any explanation
    for the questions that were raised at the  hearing  led  the  judge  to
    conclude that there was a greater lack of reliability in respect of the
    documents.

12.  As regards his claim that the State wanted to arrest him for  providing
    money to the church for unlawful purposes,  the  appellant,  the  judge
    concluded, could not account for why  the  State  might  think  he  was
    supporting the building  of  the  church  financially.   There  was  no
    evidence to show he had been sending money to Vietnam and there was  no
    reason for the authorities to  think  that  he  was  sending  money  to
    anyone.  If the money was paid to lenders, then it was implausible  the
    lenders would tell the authorities that he was paying the church.   The
    judge observed a discrepancy in that at one point  the  appellant  said
    that the money that went from  him  to  Vietnam  was  carried  for  him
    whereas elsewhere he said he paid people in the United Kingdom and they
    transferred it for him.  The judge also noted that the  appellant  said
    he was able to speak to his mother who had fled after the money lenders
    came, and he had lost touch with her, but there was no reason  why  she
    would not keep a means of communication with him (and the same for  his
    siblings, especially as his account was of sending money to them).   It
    was not said that the authorities were after  the  family.   The  judge
    regarded that to be a further adverse credibility point.  He  concluded
    that the appellant was an economic  migrant  and  did  not  accept  the
    credibility of the claim.

13.  The appellant sought and  was  granted  permission  to  appeal  on  the
    basis, as noted above, first that the judge erred in  not  granting  an
    adjournment, and secondly that there were significant errors of fact in
    his decision which were relevant to the  credibility  findings  in  the
    determination.  The first point was that he had not claimed  to  be  in
    constant fear of the loan sharks, bearing in  mind  that  payments  had
    been made, but it was a relatively recent  matter.   Also,  though  the
    judge found  that  the  appellant  had  not  claimed  his  brother  was
    threatened, his evidence was that his brother was threatened  in  2018.
    As regards the issue of contact with the  appellant's  mother,  it  was
    argued that the evidence of the appellant which  he  clarified  in  re-
    examination was that he had had two mobile phones and the  i-phone  had
    been taken in accordance with the detention centre  rules  and  he  was
    left with only one, more basic, phone.  The effect of this was that  he
    did not have all the same communication methods still available to  him
    in the detention centre in order to contact his mother.

14.  It was also argued that the judge erred in finding  the  appellant  was
    inconsistent in his evidence as to how money was sent to Vietnam to pay
    off the loan sharks in that the evidence had been that  he  never  knew
    how the money got to his family in Vietnam and it was not claimed  that
    people physically took it there.  It was also said that the judge erred
    in considering the impact of an absence of documents proving bankruptcy
    since there were credible reasons for the lack of evidence in the  fact
    that the appellant would not have had them with him from four years ago
    in Vietnam when he was in immigration detention, and secondly that  the
    judge had made an assumption that foreign law was the same  as  English
    law and that the documents would be available in the same way as in the
    United Kingdom.  It was also argued that the judge erred in  regard  to
    the appellant's abilities in English in inferring from the fact that he
    used an interpreter that he had no English language ability,  and  this
    was procedurally unfair.

15.  Permission to appeal was granted on all grounds.

16.  In his submissions  Mr  Gilbert  provided  helpful  clarification  with
    regard to the purported summons.  It appeared that there were  in  fact
    two purported summonses, only one of which had been seen by the  judge.
    It was clear that Mr Thuan, the person who obtained the summons had not
    been asked to attend the hearing.  As  regards  Ground  1,  Mr  Gilbert
    argued that  the  appellant  had  been  in  detention  and  there  were
    documents that on their face were capable of belief and the requirement
    of anxious scrutiny required more than had been done, albeit  the  role
    of the judge was not inquisitorial.  The judge's failure to  grant  the
    adjournment  request  to  enable  the  production   of   the   document
    verification report  was  unfair  and  had  a  direct  bearing  on  the
    appellant's credibility and the outcome of the appeal.

17.  Otherwise the judge had committed factual errors that were referred  to
    in in the grounds for example with regard to the  point  at  which  the
    fear of the loan sharks arose.  There was a discrepancy as to  problems
    for the appellant's brother, and  the  point  about  contact  with  his
    mother also.  The judge had also erred with regard  to  inconsistencies
    as to how the money was sent to Vietnam and that was  clearly  material
    to the credibility assessment.  Reasons had been given for the  absence
    of documents with respect of the father's bankruptcy, and it was  wrong
    to assume such documents must exist in the absence of  expert  evidence
    or agreement between the parties.   The  point  about  the  appellant's
    English had not been tested in evidence.

18.  In his submissions Mr Melvin adopted and relied on the points  made  in
    the  Rule  24  response.   As  regards  the  adjournment  request,  the
    application to adjourn had been made late, and Counsel had  been  given
    time at the hearing to make enquiries from the solicitors and then  the
    seven day period.  The appellant had overstayed for three or four years
    and produced the document very late and  the  adjournment  request  was
    unreasonable and there was no error of law.   The  judge  had  properly
    applied Tanveer Ahmed to his assessment of the document.

19.  Otherwise the judge was entitled to find as he did with respect to  the
    other issues in contention.  If there was an error it was not material.
     It was relevant to note that there was no witness statement  from  the
    person who had taken money to Vietnam.  That evidence could  have  been
    provided.  It was open to the judge to conclude as  he  did  about  the
    appellant's lack of English.  As regards the issue of documentation and
    the bankruptcy, it should be noted that at paragraph 54  the  appellant
    had accepted at the hearing that there was a formal process with regard
    to bankruptcy in Vietnam.

20.  By way of reply Mr Gilbert argued that the document had come very  late
    and the translation date was the date before the  hearing.   The  other
    matters were points of materiality with regard to errors in the judge's
    decision.  There was evidence of loss of contact with  his  family  and
    the surrender of a telephone was relevant  to  his  ability  to  obtain
    documentation.

21.  We reserved our determination.

22.  We address first of all the adjournment issue.  Clearly the matter  has
    become complicated subsequently due to the  fact  that  it  has  become
    clear that there are two summonses, only one of which was seen  by  the
    judge, but we must consider the lawfulness or otherwise of his  refusal
    to adjourn in the context of the  evidence  and  the  situation  as  it
    appeared to be before him.  Clearly he did not know that there were two
    purported summonses but simply addressed the situation on the basis  of
    the summons and the translation and other documents which were  put  to
    him.

23.  The judge, in our view very properly, first  of  all  granted  a  brief
    adjournment and then waited a further seven days in order to  enable  a
    response to questions he raised about when the document was received by
    the solicitor, who had sent it,  how  that  person  had  known  it  was
    needed, how that person had obtained it and how it had been sent to the
    solicitor and where the original was.  There was no response to any  of
    these questions.  In  those  circumstances  we  consider  that  it  was
    properly open to the judge to conclude that it was not  appropriate  to
    adjourn the hearing.  The lack of explanation  of  significant  matters
    concerning the production of this document was of clear relevance,  and
    we consider  that  the  judge  properly  exercised  his  discretion  in
    concluding that in the absence of any explanation or response to any of
    the matters he raised it was not appropriate to adjourn.

24.  He subsequently  went  on  to  consider  the  document  that  had  been
    produced, at paragraph 58 of his  decision,  and  we  have  paraphrased
    above  his  concerns  about  this.   These  matters  were:  a  lack  of
    explanation as to how the document was obtained in the absence  of  the
    person who had obtained it from the hearing, not having been  asked  to
    do  so,  the  contradiction  between  what  was  said  by  Counsel   on
    instructions that the friend had been to Vietnam to obtain  it  whereas
    the appellant said he had been to Thailand on holiday.  It was  unclear
    how this person knew the document was needed and the appellant  on  his
    return from holiday had not asked him about it and had  not  telephoned
    him and asked him about  it.   In  these  circumstances  it  is  hardly
    surprising that the judge found the purported summons  to  lack  weight
    entirely and as a consequence concluded that it did  not  identify  any
    risk to the appellant on return.

25.  As regards the  claimed  risk  from  the  loan  sharks,  the  appellant
    referred at page 7 of his statement to the lenders coming to  his  home
    and demanding money, subsequent to his father's bankruptcy.  He did not
    say when his father became bankrupt.  It would seem that  it  may  have
    been some time in 2014 as it was at the beginning of that year that the
    farm animals died which the appellant said led to his  father  becoming
    bankrupt.  In the circumstances it seems to us not unreasonable for the
    judge to have assumed (as  he  did  since  the  appellant  referred  at
    paragraph 7 of his statement immediately after  the  reference  to  the
    appellant's father becoming bankrupt to lenders coming to his home  and
    demanding money) that the threats existed from that  time,  bearing  in
    mind that he went on say his family could not  make  the  payments  and
    they were threatened by the lenders.

26.  It was also relevant for the judge to note that there was  no  evidence
    from the person who the appellant said had taken money to  Vietnam  for
    him on two occasions.  This also brings in the discrepancy found by the
    judge as to how the money was taken to Vietnam.  Paragraph  17  of  the
    appellant's witness statement  refers  to  him  sending  money  through
    private individuals by giving  them  payment  in  cash  in  the  United
    Kingdom and in return they would make payment to his father.   This  is
    in  our  view  ambiguous.   That  would  either  mean  that  they  were
    travelling to Vietnam to pay his father or they were making payment  to
    his father from the United Kingdom  through  banks  or  money  exchange
    companies.  There is reference at 25.2 of the appellant's evidence that
    he was not sure why there was no statement from the men who  had  taken
    money to Vietnam for him.  In our view it was  open  to  the  judge  to
    interpret the words  at  paragraph  17  of  the  witness  statement  as
    implying that payments had been made by bank transfer, but  the  matter
    is not a major issue in any event.

27.  As regards the issue of risk or threat or otherwise to the  appellant's
    mother, the judge recorded that the mother had been unaffected  by  the
    debt and that the appellant had mentioned no threat to his brother from
    the lenders.  Clearly however at paragraph 23.6  the  judge  had  noted
    that the appellant's brother and  sister  ran  away  when  the  lenders
    slapped their mother, and also at 25.1 the appellant said the  evidence
    was the loan sharks had also demanded money  from  his  brother.   That
    said though, we do not think  the  discrepancy  is  a  real  one.   The
    evidence, even taken at its highest, falls some way short of indicating
    a real risk to the appellant on  return.   We  therefore  consider  the
    judge was perfectly entitled not to consider that the  appellant  faced
    any real risk from the loan sharks.  Threats had  been  made,  but  the
    debt is his father's debt, and no harm beyond threats  and  his  mother
    being slapped was ever meted out to immediate members of the family.

28.  Bringing these matters together, we consider that the  judge  was  well
    within the proper exercise of his discretion in refusing to adjourn the
    appeal.  It was fully open to him to find that  the  purported  summons
    was not a reliable document, and in this regard it is relevant to  note
    also as the judge found at paragraph 59 that there was  no  reason  for
    the authorities to think that the appellant was sending  any  money  to
    anyone, as a further support for the judge's conclusion that he did not
    face a real risk on return in that regard.  As regards the claimed risk
    from the loan sharks, we consider the judge was fully entitled to  find
    there was no real risk to the appellant, in light of  the  fact  of  no
    more than threats and minimal physical harm.   Accordingly  we  do  not
    consider that any error of law in the decision has been identified  and
    as  a  consequence  the  judge's  decision  dismissing  the  appeal  is
    maintained.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
