                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

 1. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify him or any member of their family.  This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. This is an appeal against the decision issued on 15 March 2019 of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge I Ross which refused the asylum  and  human  rights
    appeal of the appellant.


 3. The appellant was born in 1981 and is a  citizen  of  the  Philippines.
    The  facts  of  her  case  are  not  in  dispute.  She  comes  from  an
    impoverished background, her parents being uneducated farmers.  She was
    educated to the age of 18 but her other siblings did not complete their
    education.  The appellant's mother became unwell and in  order  to  pay
    medical bills, her parents signed a bond  over  their  land.   As  more
    money was needed to pay for her mother's medical care,  the  appellant,
    through a family friend, obtained work in Saudi Arabia.  It is accepted
    that she was mistreated by  the  Saudi  Arabian  family  for  whom  she
    worked.

 4. The appellant came to the UK with the Saudi Arabian family on  17  June
    2013 with entry clearance  as  a  domestic  worker.   Her  mistreatment
    continued after she came to the UK and she left them later in 2013. She
    sought  advice  from  Kalayan,  an  organisation  supporting   domestic
    workers, regarding her immigration status.  She  was  referred  to  the
    National Referral Mechanism (NRM) on  20  August  2015  as  a  possible
    victim of trafficking.  She  received  a  positive  reasonable  grounds
    decision on 26 August 2015 but a negative conclusive  grounds  decision
    on 9 January 2017.  After legal proceedings, the  respondent  undertook
    to reconsider the conclusive grounds decision and, on 23 April 2018, it
    was accepted that the appellant was a victim of trafficking.   She  was
    granted leave as a domestic worker until July 2019.


 5. On 13 June 2018 the appellant claimed asylum and made  a  human  rights
    claim.  Her claim was based on a fear of mistreatment on return to  the
    Philippines from the Saudi Arabian family and the agency who  had  sent
    her to Saudi Arabia.  Her claim was also that she feared re-trafficking
    were she to be returned.   She  also  maintained  that  she  should  be
    granted leave to remain in the UK as removal would  breach  her  rights
    under Article 8 ECHR.

 6. The respondent refused the applicant's asylum and human rights claim in
    a decision  dated  12  December  2018.   The  respondent  accepted  the
    appellant's identity and nationality and  that  she  was  a  victim  of
    trafficking.  The respondent did not accept that she was a member of  a
    particular social group, that she would be at risk  on  return  to  the
    Philippines or that her removal would amount to a breach of her Article
    8 ECHR rights.

 7. The appellant appealed the respondent's decision and  the  appeal  came
    before the First-tier Tribunal on 25 January 2019.  First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Ross found that the appellant was a member of a particular social
    group; see paragraph 14.  That finding was not the subject of a  cross-
    appeal by the respondent or disputed before me and so stands.

 8. The appellant's history of abuse by the Saudi Arabian family  was  also
    accepted by the First-tier Tribunal; see  paragraph  15.   Indeed,  the
    appeal proceeded by way of submissions only where "the material  facts"
    were not in dispute, the First-tier Tribunal also  accepting  that  the
    appellant should be treated as a vulnerable witness in  line  with  the
    "Joint Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of 2010: Child, vulnerable adult
    and sensitive appellant guidance"; see paragraph 6.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal did not accept, however, for  the  reasons  set
    out in in paragraphs 16 to 18 of the decision, that the appellant faced
    a risk of persecution on return either from the Saudi Arabian family or
    the recruiting agents who had sent her to Saudi Arabia.

10. Judge Ross went on in paragraphs 19 and 20 to consider the claim to  be
    at risk of re-trafficking on return to the Philippines. In  support  of
    that claim, the appellant relied on an expert report dated  17  January
    2019 from  Professor  Sidel,  Professor  of  International  Comparative
    Politics at the London School of Economics and Political  Science.  The
    First-tier Tribunal found as follows:

         "19. In terms of any risk of re-trafficking, I have had  regard  to
             Prof Sidel's opinion at paragraphs 40 and 42 of  this  report,
             in which he points out that the appellant after many years  of
             working in Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom the appellant ,
             'simply does not have the profile,  credentials,  or  contacts
             needed for secure, stable employment'.   He  has  also  stated
             that the appellant would, 'struggle to make a livelihood,  and
             she would no longer be able to provide for her extended family
             as she has been doing for many years through her  remittances.
             Against that backdrop there is a very real likelihood that the
             appellant would be susceptible  to  re-trafficking  given  the
             serious difficulties  she  is  almost  certain  to  experience
             should she be forced to  return  to  the  Philippines.   These
             difficulties  would  be   exacerbated   by   any   harassment,
             intimidation or extortion she might face from the  recruitment
             agency which arranged her employment  in  Saudi  Arabia.   But
             even in the absence of any such problems, the appellant  would
             struggle to re-adjust and reintegrate yourself  (sic)  in  the
             Philippines, especially in terms of her economic circumstances
             and that of her extended family.  In this context,  she  might
             well opt to seek employment as a  domestic  servant  to  Saudi
             Arabia or somewhere else  in  the  Gulf,  and  she  does  find
             herself subjected to the same kinds of dangers,  difficulties,
             restrictions on freedom, and forms of  indentured  labour  and
             exploitation which she experienced in  Saudi  Arabia  and  the
             United  Kingdom.   There  is  thus  a  real  danger   of   re-
             trafficking.'


         20.  Given my finding that the  risk  to  the  appellant  from  the
             employment agency is purely speculative and not a real risk, I
             do not accept Prof Sidel's  opinion  as  to  that  risk.   The
             appellant is now 38 years old.  She has previously  worked  in
             the Philippines before she went to  Saudi  Arabia.   The  fact
             that she may face difficulties in obtaining employment in  the
             Philippines because of a prolonged absence, does  not  entitle
             her to refugee status or humanitarian protection.   I  do  not
             accept that her only option would be to return to Saudi Arabia
             or another Gulf state as a domestic worker.  The appellant has
             family support in the Philippines, as she stated (sic)  asylum
             interview, she maintains close contact with her family  there,
             speaking to them at least once a week by telephone."

11. The First-tier Tribunal also went on to dismiss the appellant's Article
    8 ECHR claim finding that she had only a limited private  life  in  the
    UK, obtained while she was here precariously, and  that  she  could  be
    expected to reintegrate in the Philippines.


12. The appellant appealed against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    and in a decision dated 11 April 2019 was granted permission to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal.

13. The grounds of appeal did not challenge the findings of the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the appellant did not face a  risk  on  return  from  the
    Saudi Arabian family or the organisation that had trafficked her. Those
    findings in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal therefore stand.

14. The grounds argued that the First-tier Tribunal failed to  address,  or
    address correctly, the appellant's claim that she faced a risk of being
    re-trafficked on return because  of  her  particular  profile.  It  was
    maintained that the components of  this  claim  had  been  put  clearly
    before the First-tier Tribunal in paragraphs 12 to 16 of  the  skeleton
    argument that had been  provided.  The  appellant's  evidence  was  not
    disputed and her witness statement dated 17 January 2019 also  set  out
    the basis of this claim.  The witness statement indicated as follows:

         "2.  In relation to paragraph 18, in relation to our  family  land,
             this came about because of  debt  my  family  had  accumulated
             because of my mother's hospital bills.  Every time she had  to
             go to hospital it would cost money.  I could  not  pay.   They
             gave us money but it was difficult to pay back.  The  interest
             on the debt kept rising and it will keep rising probably until
             I die.  I am the only one that can pay.  I am  trying  to  pay
             but when I cannot work or I am not paid then I cannot pay  the
             debt.  I keep telling them that I will pay so that they do not
             take the land.  All of my remaining family are living on  that
             land.  If they take that land then  my  family  will  be  made
             homeless.  If I lose hope then my family will lose everything.
              The land is not technically sold.  It is in debt bondage.  If
             I do not pay them back then it would go to them, but  as  long
             as I am paying the land is  still  technically  our  family's.
             Since I have gotten my leave here I have started to  pay  them
             back.  At the moment it is 3  million  pesos  and  that  money
             keeps growing every months.  The more I do not  pay  the  more
             interest I have to pay.  I was so happy when I got my right to
             work so that I was given the chance to work.  Slowly, slowly I
             am paying it.  I send my brother the money.  Every two weeks I
             send him �300.  This money goes just for the debt.


         3.   In relation to paragraph 19, it was difficult finding work.  I
             was a contactor.  So whether you are doing a good job or  not,
             after 5 months your job ends.  I think this is  because  after
             that the company have to pay tax.  There was (sic) big gaps in
             between these jobs when I could not find any work.  It is  not
             easy to find work in the Philippines.


         ...


         6.   If I go back then I will have a lot of problems  finding  work
             and will have to go back  to  working  abroad  as  a  domestic
             worker.  I am 38, nearly 39 years old.  My  education  is  for
             working as a domestic worker only.  These jobs are all abroad.
              This is the only option.  I need to work to pay off the  debt
             or else my whole family will be made homeless.  I will have to
             take whatever job I can find.  Here in the  UK  I  am  not  at
             risk.  Here I am working as a domestic worker.  I do not  live
             with my employer.  This is safer for me.  If they are not good
             to me I can walk away.  All abroad domestic work you  have  to
             live with the family.  So there is a chance that what happened
             to me will happen again.  I believe that.   I  would  have  no
             choice.  I am the only breadwinner of my family.  That is  why
             I'm not looking for a husband as I could not  feed  my  family
             and my family in the Philippines.  My  family  survive  eating
             food off the farm.  But they also have to buy things, such  as
             rice and education.  They have small jobs, only really  enough
             to cover their daily needs.  But anything additional to  that,
             like education and paying off the debt, has to come from me as
             I am the only one that can  get  a  good  paying  job  like  a
             domestic worker.  You see on social media all  the  time  that
             people are saying they are abused and  raped  in  these  jobs.
             Every time I see this I cry as I see my situation in what they
             are going through.  This is why I am speaking up and  went  on
             the news, as I want people to know and not forget what  we  go
             through.  Despite knowing this it is the only way  to  survive
             in the Philippines.  This is the only job I can do, and I will
             do anything for my family.  So there is a chance that if I  go
             back I will have to take a  job  like  this,  and  even  worse
             things may happen to me.


         ...


         8.   In  relation  to  paragraph  34  to  40,  I  am  a  victim  of
             trafficking.  I have no money.  I would like  to  hide  myself
             from my family so that they are not at  risk  from  my  former
             boss.  If I did go back then I would have no choice but to  go
             back to being a domestic worker and there is a real  chance  I
             will be trafficked and abused again.  If I came  back  all  my
             family's hope would be dashed because I am doing  my  best  to
             support them and pay back the debt.  I do not tell them  about
             the bad things that happen to me as I don't want them  to  get
             upset about it and lose hope of being able to survive.   If  I
             went back my family would expect me to go back to  work  as  a
             domestic worker abroad.  They were very happy when I found out
             that I had a visa.  They were happy that I would  be  able  to
             send them money and support them."

15. The appellant repeated in paragraphs 17,  21  and  23  of  her  witness
    statement that she would have no option but to go  abroad  again  as  a
    domestic worker because of the economic situation  in  the  Philippines
    and her obligations to her family even if this would expose  her  to  a
    risk of re-trafficking because of her family's financial situation  and
    the  overall  economic  situation  and   social   conditions   in   the
    Philippines.


16. The appellant's  evidence  was  consistent  with  the  information  she
    provided to Kalayaan (at B55 of the appellant's bundle) and  the  Women
    and Girls Network (at B63), for example, regarding her  ongoing  trauma
    as a result of being trafficked  and  showing  little  regard  for  her
    personal safety in the face of the obligation on  her  to  support  her
    family.


17. As above, before the First-tier Tribunal the claim that the  particular
    vulnerability of this appellant in the context of the Philippines  gave
    rise to a risk of re-trafficking was supported by the  expert  witness,
    Professor Sidel. He set out  his  qualifications  and  expertise  as  a
    commentator on the socioeconomic situation in the  Philippines  at  the
    beginning of his report and confirmed a correct  understanding  of  his
    duty to the court in the final paragraph.  It is not disputed that  his
    has extensive first-hand experience of  the  Philippines,  having  made
    thirteen trips to the country over the past  six  years,  speaking  two
    local languages and retains active contacts there.  He  has  researched
    the reform initiatives taking place in the country, including  economic
    policy. His experience and expertise  were  not  disputed,  albeit  the
    First-tier Tribunal did not accept all of his comments, for example  in
    paragraph 20 of the decision, set out above.

18. Professor Sidel made the following comments on  the  appellant's  claim
    that she would be re-trafficked on return to the Philippines:

          Paragraph 21:


         "The Philippines still suffers from the highest rates of poverty,
         unemployment, social inequality and human insecurity among all the
         industrialised countries of South-East Asia....the accumulated
         problems of landlessness and rapid population growth have
         guaranteed a persistently large surplus labour force, keeping
         unemployment and underemployment high and wages low....with 26
         million Filipinos estimated to be living in poverty....[23]..new
         employment opportunities have been largely restricted to the
         'service' sector, with expansion limited to low-wage, low-skill
         jobs which overwhelmingly (75%) informational in nature and thus
         highly insecure"


         Paragraph 24:


         "In terms of problems associated with human trafficking, the
         Philippines has one of the worst records in Asia. There is a long
         history of overseas labour migration and many recruitment agencies
         brokering overseas contract labour ...guilty of various forms of
         fraud...leaving overseas contact workers cheated of their earnings
         and vulnerable to various abuses by their employers overseas."


         Paragraph 27:


         "Beyond the Philippines itself, a primary destination for victims
         of human trafficking is the Middle East, in particular Saudi
         Arabia...working conditions for Filipina domestic servants are
         notoriously difficult."


         Paragraph 28:


         "Wages are extremely low, with remittances to families and debt
         payments to labour brokers who 'facilitated' recruitment and
         employment eating up the lion's share of earnings. Migrant workers
         are subjected to a sponsorship (kifala) system which locks them in
         particular jobs. ... isolation in private homes, restrictions on
         freedom of movement. ... lack of information ... and their
         vulnerable immigration status render these migrant workers
         extremely vulnerable to ill-treatment and abuse, including physical
         and sexual violence and exploitation."

19. Professor Sidel goes on to consider the appellant's claim  against  the
    background evidence on the Philippines, finding in paragraph 38 that:

         "She simply does not have the profile, credentials, or contacts
         needed for secure, stable employment. She would struggle to make a
         livelihood and would no longer be able to provide for her extended
         family as she has been doing for many years through her
         remittances"

    and in paragraph 41 (quoted in paragraph 19 of the First-tier Tribunal
    decision as set out above):

         "Against this backdrop, there is a very real likelihood that [MLD]
         would be susceptible to re-trafficking, given the serious
         difficulties she is almost certain to experience should she be
         forced to return to the Philippines...even in the absence of
         (problems re recruitment agency) [MLD] would struggle to re-adjust
         and reintegrate herself in the Philippines, especially in terms of
         her economic circumstances and that of her extended family"

    concluding in paragraph 42 that there is "a real danger of re-
    trafficking".

20. Professor Sidel went  on  in  paragraph  36  of  his  report  that  the
    respondent was "inaccurate and unrealistic  in  its  understanding  and
    expectations of the Philippine National Police" as  to  any  protection
    that the appellant  could  expect  on  return.   The  organisation  was
    "fundamentally corrupt and predatory" as had been consistently shown by
    journalists, human rights activists and scholars.  He  considered  that
    the Recovery and Reintegration Program for  Trafficked  Persons  was  a
    "very poorly resourced programme without the funding or  facilities  to
    provide much in the way of shelter  or  support".   In  addition,  this
    organisation had given priority to victims of sex trafficking and there
    was "little reason" to expect that  the  appellant  could  obtain  such
    assistance.  In paragraph 38 Professor Sidel stated that the  appellant
    would be  "ineligible"  for  a  programme  providing  conditional  cash
    transfers and in his  opinion  she  would  fall  through  the  official
    "safety net"  provided  by  the  government  for  the  country's  media
    citizens as she did not have school age children.

21. There was no dispute as to the  opinion  provided  by  Professor  Sidel
    being corroborated by the extensive country evidence relied upon by the
    appellant. The United States State  Department  (USSD)  Trafficking  in
    Persons Report 2016 at page C5 of the appellant's bundle confirms  that
    the Philippines is a source for forced labour,  with  an  estimated  10
    million Philippine  nationals  working  abroad,  a  significant  number
    comprising victims of trafficking in sectors  including  domestic  work
    across inter alia the Middle East. The same source reported in 2018  on
    how traffickers,  typically  with  local  networkers  or  facilitators,
    engage in illegal recruitment practices  that  render  migrant  workers
    vulnerable to trafficking.

22. A report from the Office of the United Nations  High  Commissioner  for
    Human Rights (OHCHR) at page C10 confirms that trafficking is prevalent
    in  the  Philippines,  with  socio-economic  conditions,  poverty,  and
    unemployment amongst the drivers. The report comments that  trafficking
    for labour exploitation has proliferated, borne from the 'dire economic
    situation' and that  many  of  those  who  leave  to  work  abroad  are
    trafficked through recruitment agencies for forced labour/debt bondage.
    The same report confirms that trafficking for domestic servitude is one
    of the most prevalent forms of cross-border trafficking, owing  to  the
    high demand for female domestic workers and large number of  Philippine
    nationals seeking overseas employment with some 30% of population going
    to work abroad in 2010  as  domestic  workers,  with  many  more  being
    clandestinely recruited.

23. The 2017 USSD Report on the Philippines comments on continuing  reports
    of adults and children being exploited in domestic  service  and  other
    informal sectors with 'unscrupulous' employers  subjecting  women  from
    poor rural or urban areas in  particular  to  domestic  servitude.  The
    Trafficking in Human Beings from the Philippines report at page C87  of
    the appellant's bundle identifies  that  the  majority  of  victims  of
    trafficking were trafficked  with  a  recruiter  or  placement  agency,
    willingly travelling abroad and deceived as to the nature of  work  and
    conditions of employment upon arrival.

24. The same reports were equally consistent on the lack of effective state
    protection  for  potential   and   actual   victims   of   trafficking,
    notwithstanding  some  limited  steps  that  had  been  taken  by   the
    Philippines authorities, for example in the USSD Trafficking report for
    2018 on page C5 of the appellant's bundle and the OCHCR report at pages
    C18 and 19.  There were numerous references to the  complicity  of  law
    enforcement and other agencies in trafficking; see, for example,  pages
    C5 and C17.   A European Parliament Resolution dated 19 April  2018  at
    page 46 of the bundles expressed  alarm  at  the  increasing  level  of
    corruption in the Philippines.

25. Having considered the materials  put  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    concerning  the  appellant's  claim  to  fear  re-trafficking  and  the
    findings made on those materials in paragraph 20 of the decision, it is
    my conclusion that the assessment conducted by the First-tier  Tribunal
    contained a material error of law. Firstly,  in  paragraph  20  of  the
    decision, the First-tier Tribunal rejects  the  evidence  of  Professor
    Sidel on the risk of re-trafficking  because  he  considered  that  the
    appellant was at risk from the employment agency, a part of  the  claim
    found elsewhere by the judge to be  "speculative".  However,  Professor
    Sidel stated  clearly,  as  set  out  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    paragraph 19 of the decision, that the risk of  re-trafficking  existed
    "even in in the absence" of a risk  from  the  employment  agency.  The
    First-tier Tribunal rejected his comments on the general  risk  of  re-
    trafficking on an incorrect basis, therefore.

26. Secondly, as indicated above, in addition to the expert  report,  there
    was a clear consensus in the country evidence from reputable sources on
    the prevalence of trafficking in the Philippines and  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal does not engage with that evidence at all.  Put
    simply, there was a  great  deal  of  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal capable of showing that the  socioeconomic  situation  in  the
    Philippines was so serious that  it  was  reasonably  likely  that  the
    appellant would have to go abroad in order to support  her  family  and
    confirming that trafficking of those going abroad, even voluntarily, as
    domestic workers was widespread.

27. Thirdly, as above, the material parts of appellant's evidence here  was
    not disputed (see paragraph 6 of the decision) and she was  clear  that
    she would be under an obligation to go abroad again to try  to  support
    her family. This had undisputedly happened in the past and  the  expert
    report and country  materials  strongly  supported  this  part  of  her
    evidence as to her being obliged to go abroad again if returned.

28. Fourthly,  the  appellant's  particular  profile  as  someone  who  had
    previously been trafficked and the role this factor played in a  future
    risk of re-trafficking was not addressed. The First-tier  Tribunal  had
    also been asked to consider the guidelines  in  HD  (Trafficked  women)
    Nigeria CG  [2016]  UKUT  00454(IAC)  but  did  not  do  so.  This  was
    potentially material here where the evidence was that having  relatives
    in the Philippines was  not  a  protective  factor  but  added  to  the
    pressure on the appellant to go abroad again as a domestic  worker.  As
    in Professor Sidel's report, her lack of education or vocational skills
    added to the pressure to go abroad as she would  be  very  unlikely  to
    find work in the Philippines. She was a vulnerable  person  because  of
    her previous experiences and the pressure on her to go abroad again  if
    returned. As someone who had previously been trafficked and  disclosing
    characteristics of vulnerability she was likely  to  be  identified  by
    traffickers within the domestic worker arena and at a  higher  risk  of
    being trafficked.

29. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal on the  risk
    of re-trafficking discloses a material error on a point of law and must
    be set aside to be re-made. The findings  on  a  risk  from  the  Saudi
    Arabian family and the employment agency remain intact.

30. Ms Profumo and Mr Melvin agreed that the re-making could proceed by way
    of submissions only given that the material evidence on  this  part  of
    the appellant's claim was not in dispute.

31. The appellant has been consistent as to being under  an  obligation  to
    support her family and that this will force her to go abroad again as a
    domestic worker. The family debt that led to her going abroad  in  2012
    has increased. The amount owed by the family is  approximately  �45,000
    and without being able to remain on the land underpinning the debt  she
    and her family would face destitution.  As before, this is not  a  case
    where the credibility of the appellant has been in issue. Further,  the
    expert report and country material supports the appellant's evidence on
    the socio-economic situation in the Philippines  being  such  that  she
    would not be able to find work and would go abroad again to prevent her
    family facing destitution. The  expert  report  and  country  materials
    shows that this is commonplace, in addition to this being the  accepted
    history of this appellant.

32. The question in this appeal, then, is not whether the appellant will go
    abroad to seek employment to support her family but whether, when doing
    so, her particular profile is such that she will face a real risk of re-
    trafficking. The expert report again provided support  for  this  being
    the case for this particular appellant because of her vulnerability  as
    someone who has already been trafficked and the pressure on her  to  go
    abroad being particularly acute as it would not be merely for  her  own
    gain but in order to prevent her family becoming destitute if they lost
    their land. As Ms Profumo submitted for the appellant,  the  fact  that
    she would "voluntarily" undertake a  risk  of  facing  further  abusive
    treatment as a domestic worker does not mean that she could not be said
    to be at a risk of trafficking. Her decision to  go  abroad  previously
    did not prevent her from being found to be a victim of  trafficking  by
    the National Referral Mechanism. Further, as set out above, the  expert
    report and country evidence is clear and consistent as to  there  being
    insufficient protection provided by  the  Philippines  authorities  for
    prospective victims of trafficking  and  those  previously  trafficked.
    someone with the appellant's profile.

33. The country evidence identifies  a  "significant  number"  of  domestic
    workers as victims of trafficking  (the  USSD  report)  and  refers  to
    exploitation  of  female  domestic  workers  being  "one  of  the  most
    prevalent forms of cross-border trafficking" (the  OCHCR  report).  The
    appellant's case is not that the country evidence is sufficient to show
    that all of those who go to work abroad as domestic workers face a real
    risk of being  trafficked.  It  has  already  been  accepted  that  the
    appellant is a member of a particular social group as someone  who  was
    trafficked in the past. It is my conclusion that her profile is  raised
    by  the  factors  of  her  having  been  trafficked   previously,   her
    vulnerability arising from that and the particular pressure on  her  to
    travel abroad to support her family. I am satisfied that those  aspects
    of her profile place her at additional and, in my conclusion, real risk
    of re-trafficking over  and  above  others  going  abroad  as  domestic
    workers.

34. For these reasons I find that the appellant has  shown  that  she  will
    face a risk of mistreatment on return to the Philippines for a  Refugee
    Convention reason and I allow her asylum claim.

Notice of Decision

35. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law such that a further assessment must be conducted as  to  whether
    the  appellant  faces  a  risk  of  re-trafficking  on  return  to  the
    Philippines.


36. The asylum appeal is allowed.
