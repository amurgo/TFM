Representation
For the appellant: Mr Ogunnubi of TM Legal Services
For the respondent: Mr Parkinson, Home Office Presenting Officer

From 1 January 2007 nationals of Bulgaria and Romania became EEA nationals.
 This has major consequences for any pending asylum-related appeals by such
persons. If their appeal relates to an immigration decision made  before  1
January 2007 - and it has not been withdrawn -  it must be  allowed,  since
removal of EEA nationals is unlawful except where public policy, health  or
security reasons require otherwise. (The only exception to this  arises  in
respect of  deportation  decisions  governed  by  regulation  8(2)  of  the
Accession (Immigration and Worker Authorisation) Regulations 2006.)

 Reported decisions on the current  AIT  list  of  Country  Guideline  cases
relating to countries which have since acceded to the EU  no  longer  afford
current guidance. It is appropriate, therefore, that  they  be  removed.  It
may be in an unusual case raising issues for example of  chain  refoulement,
that  there will still be a role for country  guidance  cases  dealing  with
member States of the EU, but clearly none  of  the  existing  cases  dealing
with the accession member States fall into that category.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a  national  of  Bulgaria.  On  26  September  2006  the
respondent made a decision to refuse to grant asylum and to remove him  from
the United Kingdom by way of directions under s.10 of  the  Immigration  and
Asylum Act 1999 (the 1999 Act). He appealed. His appeal came before me on  5
January 2007.

2. Before proceeding further, it is necessary  to  set  out  recent  changes
affecting nationals of Bulgaria and Romania as from 1 January 2007.

3. On 21 June 2005 a Treaty of Accession was signed between the 25  existing
member States of the EU and the Republic  of  Bulgaria  and  Romania  (OJ  L
157/11).  This  Treaty  provides  that  existing  member  States   can,   as
derogation from the usual position under European  Community  law,  regulate
access to their labour markets by nationals  of  Bulgaria  and  Romania  and
make consequential adjustments to their ancillary rights of residence.  This
derogation can be applied for a transitional  period  of  5  years  (from  1
January 2007 to 31 December 2011) with  provision  for  a  Member  State  to
continue to maintain restrictions for a further two years  in  the  case  of
disturbances to its labour market. Signed on the same date as  the  21  June
2005 Treaty of Accession was the  Protocol  concerning  the  conditions  and
arrangements for the admission of the republic of Bulgaria  and  Romania  to
the EU. The Treaty of Accession has  been  implemented  in  the  UK  by  the
European Union (Accessions) Act 2006 (the 2006 Act). Section 2 of  this  Act
states:

           " Freedom of movement for workers
           (1)The Secretary of State  may  by  regulations  make  provision
           concerning -
               (a) The entitlement of a national of an  acceding  State  to
               enter or reside in the United Kingdom as a worker;
               (b) Any matter ancillary to that entitlement."


4. This Act came into force on 1 January 2007.  Under  powers  conferred  by
s.2 the UK government has introduced the Accession (Immigration  and  Worker
Authorisation) Regulations 2006 (the  "2006  Accession  Regulations")  which
make provision in relation to the entitlement of nationals of  Bulgaria  and
Romania to reside and work in the United Kingdom on the accession  of  those
states to the European Union on 1 January 2007.

5. Of some importance is regulation 8 which  makes  transitional  provisions
to take account of the fact that on 1 January 2007  Bulgarian  and  Romanian
nationals and their family members will generally fall to be  treated  under
the immigration regime applying to EU nationals rather than under the  third
country national immigration regime set out in  the  Immigration  Act  1971.
Regulation 8 states:

           "(1) Where before 1 January 2007 directions have been given  for
           the removal of a Bulgarian or Romanian national  or  the  family
           member of such a national under paragraphs 8 to 10A of  Schedule
           2 to the  1971  Act  or  section  10  of  the  1999  Act,  those
           directions shall cease to have effect on and after that date.


           (2) Where before 1 January 2007 the Secretary of State has  made
           a decision to make a deportation order against  a  Bulgarian  or
           Romanian national or the family member of such a national  under
           section 5(1) of the 1971 Act -


                 (a) that decision shall, on and after 1  January  2007,  be
                 treated as if it were a decision under regulation  19(3)(b)
                 of the 2006 Regulations[the Immigration (European  Economic
                 Area) Regulations 2006] ; and
                 (b) any  appeal  against  that  decision,  or  against  the
                 refusal of the Secretary of State to revoke the deportation
                 order, made under section 63 of the  1999  Act  or  section
                 82(2)(j) or (k) of the 2002  Act  before  1  January  2007,
                 shall, on or after that date, be treated as if it had  been
                 made under regulation 26 of the 2006 Regulations.


           (3) In this regulation-


                 (a) "the 1999 Act" means the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
                 1999;
                 b) "the 2002 Act" means the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
                    Asylum Act 2002;
                 (c) any reference to the family member of  a  Bulgarian  or
                 Romanian national is a reference  to  a  person  who  on  1
                 January 2007 acquires a  right  to  reside  in  the  United
                 Kingdom under the 2006 Regulations as the family member  of
                 a Bulgarian or Romanian national."


6. (There were similar transitional  provisions  in  relation  to  nationals
from the 10 countries (the "A10") which acceded to  the  European  Union  in
May 2004:  see  regulation  6  of  the  Accession  (Immigration  and  Worker
Registration)  Regulations  2004,  since  replaced  by  provisions  in   the
Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (the  "2006  EEA
Regulations")).

7. Regulation 2 of the 2006 EEA Regulations defines "EEA national"  to  mean
"a national of an EEA State". "EEA State" is defined to mean:

           "(a) a member State, other than the United Kingdom;
             (b)Norway, Iceland or Liechenstein; or
             (c) Switzerland".


8. Since Bulgaria and Romania are now member States, nationals  of  Bulgaria
and Romania now come within the definition of EEA nationals as contained  in
the 2006 EEA Regulations, subject only to the special provisions  under  the
2006 Act and the 2006 Accession Regulations to which reference  has  already
been made.


9. Regulation 11 of the  2006  EEA  Regulations  deals  with  the  right  of
admission to the United Kingdom by an EEA national  and  certain  categories
of family members of an EEA national.  Regulation 13 headed  "initial  right
of residence" states:

           "(1) An EEA national is entitled to reside in the United Kingdom
           for a period not exceeding 3 months beginning  on  the  date  on
           which he is admitted to the  United  Kingdom  provided  that  he
           holds a valid national identity card or passport  issued  by  an
           EEA state.
           (2) A family member of an EEA national residing  in  the  United
           Kingdom under paragraph (1) who is not himself an  EEA  national
           is entitled to reside in the United  Kingdom  provided  that  he
           holds a valid passport.


           (3) But-
                 a) this regulation is subject to regulation 19(3)(b); and


                 b) an EEA national or his  family  member  who  becomes  an
                    unreasonable burden on  the  social  assistance  of  the
                    United Kingdom shall cease to have the right  to  reside
                    under this regulation."


The appellant's case
10.  In response to a request by the Tribunal for clarification  as  to  the
Home Office policy position, the  respondent  submitted  a  letter  dated  8
January 2007 from the Appeals Operational Policy Manager stating that:

           "The SSHD confirms that it is his policy as of 1  January  2007,
           that nationals of Romania and Bulgaria will only be  removed  on
           grounds of public policy, public security or public health."

11. The letter added:

           "It is emphasised that any EEA national has an unfettered  right
           to reside in the UK for up to three  months  without  exercising
           treaty rights".

(We take the latter to be a reference to  regulation  13  of  the  2006  EEA
Regulations).

12. The decision under s.82 of the 2002 Act  against  which  this  appellant
appealed was to remove from the United Kingdom by way  of  directions  under
section 10 of the 1999 Act. It was therefore an immigration decision  within
the meaning of s.82(2)(g):

           "a decision that a person is  to  be  removed  from  the  United
           Kingdom by way of directions under section 10(1)(a), (b) or  (c)
           of the Immigration and Asylum   Act  1999  (removal  of  persons
           unlawfully in United Kingdom)".


13. That decision was made on 26 September 2006. However,  by  operation  of
regulation 8(1)  of  the  Accession  Regulations  2006,  "[w]here  before  1
January 2007  directions have been given for the removal of a  Bulgarian  or
Romanian national or the family member of such  a  national  under...section
10 of the 1999 Act, those directions shall cease to have effect on or  after
that date."

14. The legal effect of this regulation as applied to the  appellant's  case
is that whilst the decision made against him still  has  effect  (regulation
8(1) only deals with directions, not with a decision that a person is to  be
removed as such) that decision can no longer be acted upon since, as an  EEA
national, the appellant is someone who is lawfully  in  the  United  Kingdom
and can only be removed on public policy grounds  (under  regulation  19  of
the 2006 EEA Regulations). Accordingly the decision  is  not  in  accordance
with the law and his appeal must be allowed on that basis.

15. It is not necessary  here  to  analyse  the  extent  to  which  the  new
position of nationals from Bulgaria and Romania is the same  as  or  differs
from that which faced nationals of the "A10" countries when their  countries
became member States of the European Union on 1 May 2004:  the  position  of
A10 nationals was dealt with in MH (Accession  nationals  not  now  removed)
Slovakia [2004] UKIAT 00315. However, from the above it  is  clear  that  in
any pending appeal by a national of Bulgaria and Romania where the  decision
is an immigration decision under s.82(2)(g), their appeal must be allowed.

16. From the wording of regulation 8 it is clear that the  same  will  apply
in the case of an immigration  decision  under  s.82(2)(h)  and  (i).  These
identify as an immigration decision:

           "(h) a decision that an illegal entrant is too be  removed  from
           the United Kingdom by way of directions under paragraphs 8 to 10
           of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act  1971  (control  on  entry:
           removal).
           (i) a decision that a person is to be removed  from  the  United
           Kingdom by way of directions given by virtue of paragraph 10A of
           that Schedule (family)".


17. The question arises as to the proper disposal of   other  asylum-related
appeals before the AIT by nationals of Bulgaria and Romania  where there  is
an immigration decision under  subsections of s. 82 other  than  s.82(2)(g)-
(i). How should such appeals be dealt with now that they are EEA  nationals?
(Plainly appeals before the AIT will not be  ones  where  the  Secretary  of
State has made use of his power to certify appeals  by  EEA  nationals:  see
s.94 (4) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, para 2 of Schedule  3
to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants,  etc)  Act  2004  and
the Asylum (First  List  of  Safe  Countries)  (Amendment)  Order  2006,  SI
No.3393.

18. The above question will  not  arise,  of  course,  where  the  appellant
chooses, as he may well do, to withdraw his appeal, in the light of the  new
legal position created by accession. In such cases a  notice  must  be  made
under Rule 17(3) of the Asylum and Immigration Appeal  Tribunal  (Procedure)
Rules 2005. However, if there is no withdrawal,  then  the  following  would
appear to be the case.

19. If the immigration decision in question is one  to  make  a  deportation
order or to refuse to  revoke  a  deportation  order  (i.e.  an  immigration
decision under s.82(2)(j) or (k)), special considerations,  albeit  somewhat
different,  also  apply:  see  regulation  8(2)  of   the   2006   Accession
Regulations.

20. Turning then to immigration decisions other than those under  s.  82(g),
(i), (j) and (k), the position is the same as that which arose  in  relation
to A10 nationals in May 2004 and the approach to be taken now should be  the
same as taken then by the Tribunal in MH. By virtue  of  having  become  EEA
nationals, nationals of Bulgaria and Romania are no longer  in  a  situation
where they face removal from the United Kingdom unless they  pose  a  threat
to public health, public policy or public security. In the absence  of  such
considerations, it would be unlawful for the Secretary of State to  seek  to
act on such a decision. The fact that they do  not  face  removal  from  the
United Kingdom means that appeals by such individuals  should  therefore  be
allowed (on EU grounds only) unless they are shown to pose such a threat.

21. In the light of the material change to the legal position  of  nationals
of countries who have since acceded to the EU (the A10 and now Bulgaria  and
Romania), it is clear that  reported decisions on the current  AIT  list  of
Country  Guideline  cases  no  longer  afford  current   guidance.   It   is
appropriate, therefore, that they be removed from this list. It  may  be  in
an unusual case raising  issues  for  example  of  chain  refoulement,  that
there will still be a role for country guidance cases  dealing  with  member
States of the EU, but clearly none of the existing cases  dealing  with  the
accession member States fall into that category.

22. For the above reasons:

23. The appeal in this case is allowed.
