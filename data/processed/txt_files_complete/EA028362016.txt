Representation:
For the Appellant:     None (the appellant appeared in person, although he
                    continued to instruct EcoM Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is  a  remade  decision  following  the  identification  of  a
         material error of law in the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Devittie  (the  judge),  promulgated  on  15  March  2018,
         dismissing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision
         dated 25 February 2016 refusing to issue him a permanent  residence
         card under the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
         2006 (the 2006 Regulations). The respondent did not accept that the
         appellant was either dependent on his EEA sponsor, or that he was a
         member of his EEA sponsor's household, as required by Reg 8 of  the
         2006 Regulations. These were the two issues in  contention  in  the
         appeal.

      2. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, date of birth  24  February
         1991. He entered  the  UK  on  16  April  2009  pursuant  to  entry
         clearance as a student. On 1 April 2010 he applied for a  residence
         card under the 2006 Regulations.  According  to  his  statement  he
         applied as a family member of an EEA national. His application  was
         however premised on his relationship with his brother's spouse (the
         EEA sponsor, Ms [DN]), a German citizen exercising Treaty rights in
         the UK. He would therefore have been applying as an Extended Family
         Member as defined in Reg 8 of the 2006 Regulations. He was issued a
         residence card on 30 September 2010. The card was  valid  until  30
         September 2015. Having been issued with  the  residence  card,  and
         pursuant to Reg 7(3) of the 2006  Regulations,  the  appellant  was
         treated, for the purposes of his residence, as a family  member  so
         long as he continued to meet the relevant conditions in Reg  8.  On
         the facts of this appeal the relevant conditions are  contained  in
         Reg 8(2). This reads, in material part,

             'A person satisfies the condition in  this  paragraph  if  the
             person is a relative of an EEA national,  his  spouse  or  his
             civil partner and -

               a) The person is residing in a country other than the  United
                  Kingdom ... and is dependent upon the EEA national or is a
                  member of his household;

               b) The person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a) and is
                  accompanying the EEA national to  the  United  Kingdom  or
                  wishes to join him there; or

               c) The person satisfies the condition in paragraph  (a),  has
                  joined  the  EEA  national  in  the  United  Kingdom   and
                  continues to be dependent upon him or to be  a  member  of
                  his household.'

      3. On  21  September  2015  the  appellant  applied  for  a  Permanent
         Residence Card as confirmation of his right to reside in the UK. He
         would be entitled to a Permanent Residence Card under Reg 15 of the
         2006 Regulations if he resided in the UK with the EEA  national  in
         accordance with the Regulations for a continuous period of 5 years.



      4. The respondent was not satisfied the appellant  continued  to  meet
         the requirements of Reg 8(2)(c)  throughout  his  5-year  residence
         since the issue of the residence card in 2010. The respondent noted
         evidence in the form of a payslip dated October 2011,  water  bills
         from September and October 2012, and a University letter dated June
         2015, relating to the appellant's residence at  [~]  Road,  Tilbury
         (the Tilbury residence). The respondent additionally noted evidence
         of the appellant's residence at [~] House, Plumstead (the Plumstead
         residence)  consisting  of  bank  statements  issued  in  June  and
         November 2013, January 2014 and February 2015. The respondent noted
         a total of 4 bank transfers from the EEA sponsor to  the  appellant
         in 2013 totalling �1,500,  and  that  the  bank  statements  showed
         regular incoming wages and student loans. The  respondent  was  not
         satisfied that the appellant had been residing with his EEA sponsor
         for a continuous period of 5 years, or that he was  dependent  upon
         her for his essential  living  needs.  As  the  conditions  of  Reg
         8(2)(c) had not been met, the appellant could not be considered  as
         a family member pursuant to Reg 7(3), and the respondent refused to
         issue the appellant with  a  Permanent  Residence  Card  under  Reg
         15(1)(b) of the 2006 Regulations.

      5. The appellant elected to have a 'paper' appeal  before  the  First-
         tier Tribunal rather than an appeal with  a  hearing.  Despite  the
         respondent's reference to several specific documents in the Reasons
         for Refusal Letter, a respondent's bundle was not produced for  the
         First-tier Tribunal  hearing.  The  appellant  filed  a  bundle  of
         documents running  to  70  pages.  This  included,  inter  alia,  a
         skeleton argument, a statement  from  the  appellant  and  a  brief
         letter from Ms [N]. There  were  also  various  documents  randomly
         placed in the appellant's bundle relating to both the  Tilbury  and
         Plumstead residences. These included, inter alia,  letters  from  a
         charity  called  the  Higher  Aims  Foundation  addressed  to   the
         appellant at the Tilbury residence and sent in 2013 and  2014,  and
         letters from Student Finance England addressed to the appellant  at
         the Tilbury residence dated 30 May 2011, 8 October 2012 (indicating
         that �8,738 would be paid to him for the  academic  year),  and  13
         August 2015 (this letter suggested the appellant  had  applied  for
         student finance for the 2015/2016  academic  year,  which  was  not
         supported by his statement). There were also Barclays Bank  account
         statements and documents addressed to the appellant at the  Tilbury
         residence from July 2015 onwards. Also contained in the bundle were
         utility bills  addressed  to  Ms  [N]  relating  to  the  Plumstead
         residence and dated 6 June 2014, 2 January 2015, and 13 July  2015,
         an undated letter and attached council tax payment  card  addressed
         to her at the Plumstead residence, a letter dated 20  October  2015
         indicating that she was in arrears in her payment  of  the  council
         tax for the Plumstead residence (in the amount of �1,042.15), and a
         Santander account  summary,  covering  January  to  February  2016,
         addressed to her at the  Plumstead  residence  (previous  Santander
         accounts covering the period 20 November 2013 to 19 December  2013,
         and 7 June 2014 to 6 August 2014, were  addressed  to  her  at  the
         Tilbury residence), as  was  a  Santander  letter  offering  her  a
         personal loan in the amount of �7,500 dated 26 November 2913.

      6. In his statement prepared for the First-tier Tribunal the appellant
         claimed he and Ms [N] lived in Plumstead when he lodged his initial
         application for a residence card in 2010, but that in June 2010 she
         and her husband,  [MI]  (the  appellant's  brother)  purchased  the
         Tilbury residence. They all lived together in Tilbury  but  Ms  [N]
         retained the Plumstead residence as she worked in  Woolwich  during
         the week and returned to Tilbury at weekends.  When  the  appellant
         commenced his studies at university in September 2011 he  moved  to
         the Plumstead residence as this was more convenient. He claimed  he
         would usually return to Tilbury at the weekends. While studying  he
         only undertook casual  work.  He  received  student  finance  which
         supported him during this period, but the  money  from  his  casual
         employment and his student finance was insufficient  to  cover  his
         living expenses in London. He  claimed  Ms  [N]  gave  him  'pocket
         money' when he ran out of money, and she paid the rent, the utility
         bills and the council  tax.  Without  this  support  the  appellant
         claimed it would have been very difficult for him to meet his daily
         needs. The appellant claimed to have finished his studies  in  2014
         and that he started doing agency work with the  NHS.  He  lived  in
         Tilbury fulltime but regularly came to  London  for  his  work  and
         would sometimes stay at  the  Plumstead  residence.  The  appellant
         claimed he was a member of Ms [N]'s household throughout the 5-year
         period, and that when he was not physically  present  in  the  same
         house as her, he was dependent on her as he resided in  a  property
         she owned or in respect of which she paid the rent and the bills.

      7. A brief letter from Ms [N], dated 16 September 2015, merely  stated
         that her sister-in-law and the appellant were dependent on her  and
         her husband, and that the  appellant  and  her  sister-in-law  were
         financially supported and that they had "... also become  a  member
         of our household."

      8. In dismissing the appeal the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  gave  two
         reasons why he was not satisfied the appellant had  been  dependent
         on the sponsor for a continuous 5-year period.

               1) The appellant has provided an elaborate account of how  he
                  was living in a property in which the sponsor had retained
                  her tenancy and in which he  continued  to  meet  all  the
                  bills after she moved  to  Tilbury.  His  account  is  not
                  supported  by  any  documentary  evidence,  such  as   the
                  sponsor's tenancy, on which he relies.  More  importantly,
                  the  sponsor,  given  the  opportunity  in   her   witness
                  statement to  support  this  appeal,  fails  to  make  any
                  mention of the detailed arrangements in terms of which she
                  continued to pay rental after moving to Tilbury and did is
                  [sic] solely because appellant was dependent on her.

               2) The appellant accepts that in 2014 he  obtained  full-time
                  employment and thus became fully self-sufficient. On  this
                  basis alone he cannot prove that he was a dependent of the
                  sponsor for a period of five years.

      9. The error of law decision was promulgated by the Upper Tribunal  on
         17 October 20018. In that decision the Upper  Tribunal  found  that
         the judge  directed  himself  only  in  respect  of  the  issue  of
         dependency and did not consider whether,  on  the  evidence  before
         him, the  appellant  could  be  considered  a  member  of  the  EEA
         sponsor's household. Dependency on the EEA sponsor  and  membership
         of the EEA sponsor's household are  alternative  routes  under  Reg
         8(2)(c) (see, for example, Moneke (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011]  UKUT
         341 (IAC)). The Upper Tribunal additionally found  that  the  judge
         failed to consider relevant evidence going to  the  issue  of  both
         dependency and membership of the EEA sponsor's household. The Upper
         Tribunal consequently set the judge's decision aside. As the  Upper
         Tribunal was concerned that the full  picture  of  the  appellant's
         circumstances in the 5-year period since the issue of  a  residence
         card to him in 2010 has not yet been fully disclosed,  and  mindful
         that the appellant sought to serve new evidence in accordance  with
         Rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,
         it was considered appropriate to  remake  the  appeal  following  a
         further oral hearing.

     10. A further hearing was listed for 11 December  2018.  The  appellant
         attended that hearing and was  represented  by  Mr  D  Balroop,  of
         Counsel. During the early stage of the appellant's oral evidence it
         emerged that he had a brother who, he claimed,  had  recently  been
         issued a permanent residence card following  a  successful  appeal.
         The basis of the brother's application for  a  permanent  residence
         card was said to be similar to  the  appellant's  application.  The
         appellant additionally claimed that his mother and  younger  sister
         had also been issued residence cards. Nor  was  there  any  further
         evidence from the EEA sponsor, and she did not attend the  hearing.
         In these circumstances the hearing  was  adjourned  and  the  Upper
         Tribunal  issued  directions  requiring   the   appellant's   legal
         representatives to file with  the  Upper  Tribunal  the  First-tier
         Tribunal decision in the appeal of the appellant's brother  ([EI]),
         and the Home Office references relating to the  same  brother,  the
         appellant's mother ([JI]), and the appellant's sister  ([SI]).  The
         Upper Tribunal additionally issued a witness  summons  to  the  EEA
         sponsor  (Ms  [DN])  requiring  her  attendance  at  the  adjourned
         hearing.

     11. The appellant's  legal  representatives  provided  a  copy  of  the
         decision by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Freer, promulgated  on
         7 June 2018, and provided the requested Home Office references. The
         appellant additionally provided a  copy  of  his  daughter's  birth
         certificate, who was  born  on  20  December  2018.  Judge  Freer's
         decision was made on the basis of the papers before him as [EI] did
         not elect to have an oral hearing.

     12. On 13 February 2019 the Upper Tribunal received an  email  from  Ms
         [N]. The Subject heading read "Application to set aside my  witness
         summons Appeal no EA/02836/2016". The body of the email read,

             "To whom it may concern,

             I received a witness summons letter to attend a hearing.

             I [DN] hereby write to inform  you  that  I  do  not  wish  to
             support the above case.

             In this case, can I be excused from attending court.

             Can this request be placed before the judge and kindly keep me
             informed of the outcome."

     13. On 14 February 2019 the Upper Tribunal responded to Ms [N] by email
         and requested that she set out in clear terms what she  meant  when
         she said she did "not wish to support the above case" and  why  she
         did not want to attend the hearing. On 18 February 2019  the  Upper
         Tribunal received a further email from Ms [N]. This stated,

             "To whom it may concern,

             Following my previous email, I confirm I will now be attending
             the court hearing on 19/02/2019. Please disregard my  previous
             email."

     14. By a fax sent at 21:02 on 18 February 2019, received by  the  Upper
         Tribunal on 19 February 2019, EcoM Solicitors  informed  the  Upper
         Tribunal that the appellant has not instructed them to  attend  the
         appeal hearing, and that he  would  be  attending  in  person.  The
         appellant attending the hearing on 19 February 2019.  Ms  [N]  also
         attended the hearing, as did the appellant's mother. All three gave
         oral evidence.

     15. In addition to the original bundle of documents  prepared  for  the
         First-tier Tribunal hearing, the appellant additionally provided  a
         'Rent Arrears: Payment Reminder' issued by  the  Royal  Borough  of
         Greenwich, dated 17 July 2012  and  addressed  to  Ms  [N]  at  the
         Plumstead property indicating that the  Borough  was  owed  �229.02
         relating to water and housing charges. A Housing Account Statement,
         dated 8 July 2013 and issued by the Directorate of Housing Services
         of the Royal Borough of Greenwich indicated that the  property  was
         �219.31 in arrears, and a similar  document  dated  14  April  2014
         indicated that the property was �543.71 in arrears.

     16. In his oral evidence  at  the  hearing  on  19  February  2019  the
         appellant confirmed that he had  not  provided  any  tax  documents
         relating to his employment between 2010  and  2015.  The  appellant
         claimed no one advised him to adduce these documents. The appellant
         initially claimed that Ms [N] owned the Plumstead property and  was
         not aware whether the property was mortgaged.  The  appellant  then
         said he was unaware whether the property was owned or  rented.  The
         appellant denied paying any rent  to  Ms  [N]  in  respect  of  the
         Plumstead property. The appellant  claimed  that  Ms  [N]  and  his
         brother supported him before and after his education. The appellant
         claimed to have earned money "cash-in-hand". The  appellant  stated
         that, before the Tilbury property was purchased, the persons living
         in the two-bedroom property in Plumstead were him and  his  younger
         sister (who was a minor), Ms [N] and her husband and  their  child,
         his brother [EI] and their mother. After the general  move  to  the
         Tilbury property Ms [N] would spend time in the Plumstead  property
         because she had a job in the Santander Bank in Woolwich.  According
         to the appellant Ms [N] would stay at the Plumstead  property  from
         Monday to Friday and would return to the Tilbury property  for  the
         weekends.

     17. When asked about the water bill in his name dated 17  October  2012
         and  addressed  to  the  Tilbury  property,  the  appellant  freely
         admitted that he had no other means of showing that he lived in the
         property and his name was added for that purpose. The appellant did
         not pay the water bills. When asked whether he had  begun  repaying
         his student loan the appellant believed the repayments  were  taken
         from his payslips when he started doing casual  work.  He  did  not
         have any evidence that he was repaying his student loans.  He  went
         back to university in 2015 but couldn't continue his course.

     18. The appellant claimed that, when he  was  studying  at  the  London
         Metropolitan University, he would spend 2 or 3 days every  week  at
         the Plumstead property and would spend the remainder of the week at
         the Tilbury property. When he studied at  Greenwich  University  in
         2012 the appellant would spend 3 or 4 days a week at the  Plumstead
         property and would spend his weekends in Tilbury, and sometimes  in
         London. The appellant said that Ms [N] continued  to  live  in  the
         Plumstead property until she was  transferred  to  another  job  in
         Basildon, that was closer to Tilbury. He believed this happened  in
         2013 or 2014. Although she would spend some time in Plumstead,  she
         spent most of the time at the Tilbury property. When asked  why  Ms
         [N] would still spend some time  in  the  Plumstead  property,  the
         appellant said he did not know.

     19. The appellant claimed that he and his younger brother  ([EI])  were
         both moving between the Plumstead property and the Tilbury property
         while they were studying. The appellant confirmed that Ms [N] acted
         as an EEA sponsor to him, his brother [EI], his sister [SI] and his
         mother [JI]. The  appellant  said  that  his  brother  [MI]  was  a
         businessman and was a qualified nurse  and  had  other  businesses,
         including an educational business. No one had  asked  him  to  give
         evidence.

     20. In her oral evidence Ms [N] was  asked  what  she  meant  when  she
         emailed the Tribunal stating that she did "not wish to support  the
         above case." She said she was going through issues in her  personal
         life but had a rethink. When asked what changed her mind  she  said
         that she sorted out what she needed  to  sort  out.  She  said  she
         rented the Plumstead property and had done so since  2009.  It  was
         registered in her name. She was  "coming  and  going"  between  the
         Tilbury and Plumstead properties due to her work while her  mother-
         in-law helped with her children. She worked at the Woolwich  branch
         of  the  Santander  Bank  and  the  Plumstead  property  was   more
         convenient for her to get to work. Ms [N] said she "sometimes" went
         to the Tilbury property at weekends. She said that she only  worked
         in Basildon for a short while, and this was in 2017. She claimed to
         have worked in other Santander branches such as  Lakeside  Shopping
         Centre and Gravesend. She could not remember which year she  worked
         at the Lakeside Shopping Centre. When asked whether there was  ever
         a time that she predominantly resided in the  Tilbury  property  Ms
         [N] became evasive, claimed she didn't know what was meant  by  the
         question, and stated that she stayed in both properties. She denied
         ever moving back to the Tilbury property on a more permanent basis.
         When asked where she spent most of her time in 2013  and  2014  she
         said she couldn't really say.

     21. Ms [N] said that the appellant took casual jobs  between  2010  and
         2014 in between his studies. She said that she rented the Plumstead
         property from Greenwich  Borough  Council  and  claimed  she  could
         provide evidence of continuous rental payments, although none  were
         provided in the documents prepared for the appeal. She also claimed
         she  could  provide  council  tax   documentation   and   documents
         confirming that the local authority was aware of  the  identity  of
         those residing in the property, but these were not produced at  the
         hearing. She did not know why the appellant's name  appeared  on  a
         water bill relating to the Tilbury property. Ms [N] maintained that
         she had access to both the Tilbury and  the  Plumstead  properties.
         Her husband paid the mortgage in respect of  the  Tilbury  property
         and she paid the rent in respect of the  Plumstead  property.  When
         asked why she needed another address if she was primarily residing,
         according to the appellant, at the Tilbury address from either 2013
         or 2014, Ms [N] again became evasive and aggressive  and  said  she
         could decide where she wanted to live. When asked whether there was
         any particular reason why she would wish to continue living between
         the two properties, Ms [N] said there was "no  particular  reason."
         When asked why, if the appellant was working,  he  didn't  pay  any
         rent for living in the Plumstead property, Ms [N] said  she  didn't
         expect him  to.  When  asked  how  she  financially  supported  the
         appellant from 2010 to 2015 she said that she  sometimes  gave  him
         cash and sometimes transferred money to his account.

     22. The appellant's mother, [JI], gave evidence. [JI] claimed  that  Ms
         [N] worked in the Lakeside Shopping Centre  but  didn't  know  when
         this employment commenced and was unable to even guess the year  in
         which the employment at Lakeside commenced. [JI] could not remember
         where her daughter-in-law worked before she moved her job  location
         to Lakeside. [JI] claimed that Ms [N] spent most  of  her  time  in
         Plumstead, but would come to Tilbury  to  see  her  children.  When
         asked where Ms [N] currently resided [JI]  remained  silent  for  a
         significant amount of time  and  eventually  said  that  she  lived
         mostly in Tilbury now. When asked how long Ms [N] had  been  living
         'mostly' in Tilbury, [JI] said she couldn't remember. [JI]  claimed
         that Ms [N] now worked in Thurrock for Thurrock Council. When asked
         where Ms [N] lives  during  the  week  [JI]  said,  "she  lives  in
         Tilbury, she lives in Plumstead. I can't be checking the  time  she
         lives in both." [JI] did not know why her daughter-in-law  retained
         two addresses if she worked locally near Tilbury. When asked how Ms
         [N] was able to support her, [SI], [EI], and the appellant, and pay
         rent and cover a mortgage, [JI] said that her other son worked.  He
         was a businessman and had a company. When asked why Ms [N] was  not
         living permanently in the same house as her husband  and  children,
         [JI] said she did not know.

     23. Mr Melvin invited me to find the evidence from  the  appellant,  Ms
         [N] and [JI] to be incredible. There was said to be  little  or  no
         evidence of  financial  dependency,  and  little  evidence  of  the
         appellant's  residence  at  either  the  Tilbury  property  or  the
         Plumstead property. Ms [N], it  was  submitted,  gave  deliberately
         vague evidence with respect to the Plumstead property. There was no
         evidence of where the funds for the rent payments for the Plumstead
         property originated and it was likely that the property was in fact
         being  sublet.  It  was  submitted  that,   on   the   balance   of
         probabilities, the appellant was paying the bills and the  rent  in
         respect of the  Plumstead  property  from  his  own  earnings.  The
         appellant submitted that Ms  [N]  owns  both  properties,  that  he
         wasn't paying any rent, that she paid the bills and  that  she  was
         resident  at  both  properties.  He  referred  to   his   brother's
         successful appeal and stated that his brother, [EI], spent time  at
         the Plumstead property. He invited me to  find  that  the  evidence
         showed that he spent time between the two properties  and  that  he
         was part of Ms [N]'s household.

Findings of fact and conclusions

     24. I have considered the decision of judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
         Freer in respect of the paper appeal of  the  appellant's  brother,
         [EI], promulgated on 7 June 2018. In AA (Somalia) [2007]  EWCA  Civ
         1040 the Court of Appeal considered the  approach  that  should  be
         adopted when considering what weight to attach to a finding of fact
         in one person's asylum/human rights appeal when those findings  are
         relevant in another person's subsequent asylum/human rights appeal.
         After a detailed consideration of  authorities  on  the  issue  the
         Court of Appeal held, at [21], that, "The  second  tribunal  should
         have regard to the earlier decision but only as a starting  point."
         At  [29]  the  Court  stated,  "In  cases  where  the  parties  are
         different, the second tribunal should have regard  to  the  factual
         conclusions of the first tribunal but must  evaluate  the  evidence
         and  submissions  as  it  would  in  any  other  case.  If,  having
         considered the factual  conclusions  of  the  first  tribunal,  the
         second tribunal rationally reaches different  factual  conclusions,
         then it is those conclusions which it must apply and not  those  of
         the first tribunal."

     25. The 'key point' in Judge Freer's  decision  was  whether  [EI]  was
         either a member of Ms [N]'s household for the period 7 June 2012 to
         7 June 2017 or  dependent  on  her  during  the  same  period.  The
         decision was determined without an oral hearing.  The  judge  found
         that "the sponsor also resided in the flat on some days due to work
         commitments." The judge stated that a 72-page bundle  was  produced
         by [EI] and that it contained "ample evidence from  many  different
         years showing  that  the  German  national  sponsor  owns  the  two
         addresses stated." The judge does not identify any  of  the  actual
         evidence contained in the bundle. The judge's  conclusion  that  Ms
         [N] (the German national  sponsor)  "owns  the  two  addresses"  is
         contradicted by Ms [N]'s own evidence that she rents the  property.
         The  judge  concluded  that  [EI]  had  shown  both  dependency  of
         household and dependency of income.  I  approach  the  decision  of
         Judge Freer as my starting point, but I note  that  I  have  had  a
         considerably greater opportunity to probe the evidence produced  by
         the appellant.

     26. In order to be issued a Permanent Residence Card under  Reg  15  of
         the 2006 Regulations the appellant must demonstrate, to the balance
         of probabilities standard, that he was either dependent on  Ms  [N]
         or a member  of  her  household  for  the  continuous  period  from
         September 2010 to September 2015. The appellant and Ms [N]  contend
         that she provided him with financial support in order  for  him  to
         meet his basic needs by giving him money and by paying the rent  or
         the mortgage in respect  of  the  properties  in  which  they  both
         resided, and that the appellant was, in any event, a member of  her
         household as they both resided at the  Tilbury  and  the  Plumstead
         properties.

     27. I will first consider whether the appellant  was  a  member  of  Ms
         [N]'s household. The appellant's bundle contains  a  Land  Registry
         document confirming that [MI] and  Ms  [N]  purchased  the  Tilbury
         property  on  17  June  2010.  The  overwhelming  majority  of  the
         documents linking Ms [N] to the Plumstead property date  from  2014
         onwards. A Rent Arrears Payment  Reminder  letter  from  the  Royal
         Borough of Greenwich, dated 17 July 2012, suggests however that  Ms
         [N] was registered with the Local  Authority  as  the  tenant.  Two
         Housing Account Statements, dated 8 July 2013 and  14  April  2014,
         both addressed to Ms [N] at the Plumstead  property,  also  suggest
         that she was the registered tenant of  the  property.  I  note  the
         evidence that, at the date of the appellant's  initial  application
         for a residence card in 2010 he identified the  Plumstead  property
         as his residence, and that an Aviva mortgage insurance contract was
         addressed to Ms [N] at the Plumstead property in June 2010,  and  I
         note Ms [N] claim, made in oral evidence, that she had  rented  the
         Plumstead property since 2009. I additionally take into  account  a
         Council Tax Arrangement letter  issued  by  the  Royal  Borough  of
         Greenwich, dated 20 October 2015, addressed to Ms [N] and  relating
         to an arrangement regarding the payment of a Council  Tax  debt  of
         �1,042 in respect of the Plumstead property. I find, based on  this
         evidence, that Ms [N] is the registered  tenant  of  the  Plumstead
         property and has been for the relevant  period  September  2010  to
         September 2015.

     28. There remains however limited evidence that the funds used  to  pay
         the rent in respect of the Plumstead  property  actually  originate
         from Ms [N], or that she has continuously resided in the  Plumstead
         property during the period September 2010 to September 2015.  There
         is, for example, no evidence that the rental payments in respect of
         the Plumstead property come out of any bank account held by Ms [N].
         This is a surprising omission given the basis  of  the  respondents
         refusal to issue a residence card and the concerns raised  both  by
         the First-tier Tribunal judge and by  the  Upper  Tribunal  at  the
         'error of law' hearing and the subsequent adjourned hearing. Nor is
         there adequate evidence relating to her  employment  and  financial
         circumstances, a point of some relevance given her claim  that  she
         pays the rent on the Plumstead property  and  financially  supports
         the appellant, his brother [EI], his sister [SI] and their  mother,
         [JI].

     29. There is also  limited  evidence  of  Ms  [N]'s  residence  at  the
         Plumstead property. There is a dearth of correspondence relating to
         her residence at the Plumstead property in 2010 and 2011,  and  the
         only document linking her to the property in 2012 and 2013 of those
         identified in paragraph 27 above. The appellant's  bundle  contains
         two letters issued by E.on (the utility company) dated 6 June  2014
         and 19 June 2014 addressed to Ms  [N]  at  the  Plumstead  property
         requesting the gas and electricity meter readings for the  property
         as "we're  nearing  the  end  of  your  switch  to  us."  There  is
         additionally a further letter to Ms [N] from E.on, dated 2  January
         2015, welcoming her to the utility company, and a 'First prepayment
         gas statement' dated 13 July 2015. There is a council  tax  payment
         card addressed to Ms [N] at the Plumstead  property,  but  this  is
         undated. Nor is there any date on a Vodafone advert sent to Ms  [N]
         at the Plumstead property.

     30. These documents must be balanced against  the  evidence  suggesting
         that Ms [N] has resided at the Tilbury property  as  her  principal
         residence during the relevant period, which includes Santander Bank
         account statements addressed to her at the Tilbury property in 2013
         and  2014,  a  letter  dated  November  2013  indicating  that   an
         application for a personal loan in the sum of �7500 was successful,
         mobile phone bill statements dating  from  2014,  HMRC  tax  credit
         documents relating to the years 2012 - 2013, 2013 -  2014,  2014  -
         2015, and 2015 - 2016, water utility  bills  issued  in  2015,  and
         child benefit documents dated December 2012. Although  a  Santander
         Bank account statement for the period January to February 2016  was
         addressed to Ms [N] at the Plumstead property this related  to  the
         period outside consideration for the purposes of the issuance of  a
         permanent residence card, and after the application for a residence
         card was made.

     31. The oral evidence from the witnesses compounds my concerns with the
         written evidence relating to whether the appellant was a member  of
         Ms [N]'s household. I observe at  the  outset  that  the  appellant
         initially believed that Ms [N] owned the  Plumstead  property.  The
         appellant is an intelligent man as demonstrated by his  educational
         achievements, and, on his evidence, would have lived  with  Ms  [N]
         for a considerable period of time.  I  do  not  therefore  find  it
         credible that he would have failed  to  appreciate  the  difference
         between owning and renting, and would have been unaware that Ms [N]
         was  renting  the  Plumstead  property.  More  significantly,   the
         appellant said Ms [N] changed the location of her job  to  Basildon
         in either 2013 or 2014, and that, as Basildon was closer to Tilbury
         than Plumstead, she thereafter  spent  most  of  her  time  at  the
         Tilbury property. Ms [N] however said she only worked  in  Basildon
         for a short while, and this was in 2017. Given that  the  appellant
         and Ms [N] are said to have lived in the same property, and  indeed
         that Ms [N] did most of the cooking (statement, at paragraph 5), it
         is not credible that the appellant would be unaware of where Ms [N]
         worked. The appellant also said that Ms [N] spent most of her  time
         at the Tilbury property  after  changing  jobs  in  2013  or  2014.
         However, when asked where she resided most of the time in 2013  and
         2014 Ms [N] said she couldn't really say. Attempts  to  clarify  Ms
         [N]'s evidence  were  met  by  aggressive  and  evasive  responses.
         Although the appellant said that Ms [N] would spend her weekends at
         the Tilbury property she maintained that she would  only  sometimes
         go  to  the  Tilbury  property  at  weekends  and  stayed  at  both
         properties, and denied that she moved back to reside at the Tilbury
         property on a more permanent basis. This is in  flat  contradiction
         to the appellant's evidence. [JI], on the other hand, claimed  that
         Ms [N] spent most of her time  in  Plumstead,  but  would  come  to
         Tilbury to see her children. This is contrary to both the  evidence
         from  the  appellant  and  the  evidence   from   Ms   [N].   These
         inconsistencies significantly undermine  the  weight  that  can  be
         attached to the evidence relating to whether the appellant was part
         of Ms [N]'s household during the relevant period.

     32. When asked why Ms [N] would still spend some time in the  Plumstead
         residence if, according to the appellant, she  predominantly  lived
         in the Tilbury property after 2013 or 2014,  he  said  he  did  not
         know. When asked whether there was any particular  reason  why  she
         would wish to continue residing between two  different  properties,
         Ms [N] said "no particular reason."  I  am  not  satisfied  Mr  [N]
         provided a satisfactory answer. It is simply not credible that  she
         would reside in the Plumstead  property  when  she  had  two  young
         children living in the Tilbury  property  and  when  her  place  of
         employment was, according to the appellant, much closer to Tilbury.
         I also bear in mind that Ms [N] did  not  produce  any  documentary
         evidence of her employment at any of the Santander  bank  branches,
         or any documentary evidence relating to  when  she  worked  in  the
         different branches.

     33. When asked where Ms [N] currently resided [JI] remained silent  for
         a significant amount of time and eventually said that Ms [N]  lived
         'mostly in Tilbury now'. I found [JI]'s evidence on this  point  to
         be  evasive.  She  was  asked  a   straightforward   question   but
         significantly hesitated before giving an  answer.  When  asked  how
         long Ms [N] had lived 'mostly in Tilbury' [JI] said she  could  not
         remember and could not even give an estimate  of  the  year.  Given
         that [JI] lives with Ms [N] it is not credible that [JI]  would  be
         unable to give even a rough  estimate.  When  asked  where  Ms  [N]
         currently lives, [JI] said, "she lives in  Tilbury,  she  lives  in
         Plumstead. I can't be checking the time she lives  in  both."  When
         asked why Ms [N] was not permanently living in the  same  house  as
         her husband and children, [JI] said she did not know. [JI]  claimed
         that Ms [N] now worked for Thurrock Council  in  Thurrock.  I  take
         judicial notice of the fact that Thurrock is very close to  Tilbury
         geographically. Although  I  am  only  concerned  with  the  period
         September 2010 to September 2015, the evidence relating to Ms [N]'s
         current residence is  relevant  to  the  issue  of  the  witnesses'
         credibility. if Ms [N] worked in Thurrock it would make more  sense
         for her to live in the Tilbury property rather than  the  Plumstead
         property. Yet she maintains that she continues  to  reside  in  the
         Plumstead property as well. I do not find it credible that  Ms  [N]
         would continue to reside in the Plumstead property and I  find  her
         evidence to the contrary undermines her general credibility.

     34. Ms [N] initially emailed the tribunal saying that she did not  wish
         to support the appellant's case. She later sought to disregard this
         email. At the hearing she  did  not  disclose  the  nature  of  the
         personal reasons that led her to initially withdraw her support  of
         the appellant's case and to then change her mind. In the absence of
         any explanation it is  of  some  relevance  that  Ms  [N]  did  not
         initially wish to support the  appellant's  case  when  determining
         whether the appellant has actually been dependent on her or been  a
         member of her household.

     35. In the absence of any evidence that Ms [N] was actually paying  the
         rent  on  the  Plumstead  property,  and  given   the   significant
         inconsistencies and  implausibilities  in  the  evidence  described
         above, I am not  persuaded  that  the  Plumstead  property  can  be
         regarded as having been Ms [N]'s actual household  for  the  period
         September 2010 to at least 2014, when the appellant  completed  his
         studies and claims to have returned to  the  Tilbury  residence.  I
         find it more likely than not that  the  property  was,  during  the
         relevant period, sublet to the appellant or another  person.  I  am
         not persuaded that she actually resides there during  the  relevant
         period or that she  paid  the  rent  on  the  property  during  the
         relevant period. It is for these reasons that  I  depart  from  the
         decision of judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Freer.  I  therefore
         find that the appellant was not a member of Ms [N]'s household from
         the period September 2010 to the time he completed his  studies  in
         2014.

     36. I must now consider whether the appellant was dependent on  Ms  [N]
         during the period September 2010  to  the  time  he  completed  his
         studies and moved back to the Tilbury property in 2014.

     37. There is a dearth of evidence that I  would  reasonably  expect  to
         have been provided relating to  the  appellant's  income  over  the
         period 2010 to 2015 and his tax liability covering the same period.
         No reasonable explanation was advanced by  the  appellant  for  the
         absence of such evidence, such as employment documents, P45s, P60s,
         which were materially relevant to determining whether  he  was  not
         earning sufficient money to meet his essential needs, applying  the
         principles established in Lim  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer  Manila
         [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 relating to dependency.

     38. The appellant's Barclays Bank statements in the respondent's bundle
         show that Ms [N] made 4 bank transfers into  the  appellant's  bank
         account  in  2013,  totalling  �1,500.  While  the  appellant  also
         provided  Barclays  Bank  statements  relating   to   his   account
         haphazardly covering the period 25 November 2009 to 2015, there was
         no evidence of any further payments made by Ms [N] to him. I accept
         that the bank account statements do show some  transfers  from  the
         appellant's brother, [MI], but these are made either in 2014 or  in
         the years 2009 to 2010. There is little or no evidence of any money
         transfers from [MI] to the appellant in the  period  from  2010  to
         2014. The appellant's  bank  account  statements  do  however  show
         deposits in respect of his employment during the  relevant  period,
         and his receipt of significant funds in the form of student  loans.
         There is no statement from [MI] concerning any money  he  may  have
         given to  the  appellant  and  no  details  of  his  own  financial
         circumstances during the relevant period.  Given  my  very  serious
         concerns relating to Ms [N]'s credibility, I  do  not  find  I  can
         attach much weight to her claim that she gave the appellant  'cash-
         in-hand' informally.

     39. According to the decision in [EI]'s appeal, Ms [N]  was  supporting
         him during the  period  2012  to  2017.  Other  than  some  account
         summaries that do not identify any transactions, and one  statement
         showing transactions for the period 13 December 2013 to 19 December
         2013,  there  is  very  little  evidence  of  Ms  [N]'s   financial
         circumstances during the relevant period. The very limited evidence
         relating to her financial circumstances suggests that she needed to
         take out a loan of over �7000 at the end  of  2013.  She  was  also
         supporting  her  mother  in   law.   The   evidence,   cumulatively
         considered, does not show that the sponsor  or  her  husband  would
         have been earning sufficient funds to enable  them  to  financially
         support the number of people that she claims to have sponsored.

     40. Based on the limited documentary  evidence  available  to  me,  and
         having regard to my adverse credibility findings identified  above,
         I am not persuaded that Ms [N] and her husband have been  providing
         the appellant with money necessary  to  meet  his  essential  needs
         during the period September 2010 to September 2015.

     41.  I  consequently  find  that  the  appellant  does  not  meet   the
         requirements for the issuance of a permanent residence card.
