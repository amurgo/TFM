    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Mr J Collins of
           counsel instructed by Stanley Goldman Solicitors
          For the Respondent: Mr P Duffy a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey who was born on 3 April 1977.  He
      has been given permission to appeal the  determination  of  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Nightingale and Mr M J Griffiths JP DL ("the First-Tier
      Tribunal") who dismissed his appeal against the respondent's  decision
      of 18 October 2013 to make  a  deportation  order  against  him  under
      Section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 on the  grounds  that  the
      respondent deemed his deportation to be conducive to the public  good.
      On 25 January 2001 the appellant had been  convicted  in  the  Aksaray
      Criminal Court in Turkey of one count  of  kidnapping,  one  count  of
      assault and one count of battery. He had been sentenced to  two  years
      and six months imprisonment.


   2. The appellant appealed and the First-Tier Tribunal heard his appeal on
      21 March 2014. Both parties were represented and  the  appellant  gave
      evidence. The First-Tier Tribunal found him to be a  credible  witness
      and accepted that he was not aware  that  he  had  been  convicted  in
      Turkey in his absence until he visited the  Turkish  Embassy  in  this
      country to renew his passport. He had  not  intended  to  mislead  the
      respondent when he filled in the application form for  naturalisation.
      However, he had been convicted of criminal offences in Turkey in 2001.
      Subsequently, he was  extradited  to  Turkey  and  served  a  term  of
      imprisonment which was less than the original sentence  of  2ï¿½  years.
      The  First-Tier  Tribunal  observed  that  there   was   a   lack   of
      documentation to provide information about the offences.


   3. The First-Tier Tribunal found  that  the  appellant  had  no  criminal
      convictions in this country and had been of good character during  the
      12 years he had lived her. During that period he had worked  and  sent
      money to support his family in  Turkey.  His  wife  and  children  had
      always lived there.


   4. The First-Tier Tribunal considered the provisions of  paragraphs  363,
      397, 398, 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules. The appellant pursued
      the appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds  only,  both  within  and
      outside the Immigration Rules. The First-Tier Tribunal found that  the
      appellant could  not  bring  himself  within  any  of  the  Article  8
      provisions in the Immigration Rules before going on  to  consider  the
      Article 8 grounds outside the  Immigration  Rules  and  in  particular
      whether there were exceptional circumstances in line with SS (Nigeria)
      v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  550,
      Nasim and others (Article 8) Pakistan [2014]  UKUT  25  (IAC)  and  in
      particular the guidance of the Court  of  Appeal  in  MF  (Nigeria)  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.


   5. The First-Tier Tribunal found that there had been delay in  processing
      the appellant's asylum claim and that he had formed a limited  private
      life in this country. He had not absconded from  the  jurisdiction  of
      the Turkish courts and had not attempted to  deceive  the  immigration
      authorities in this country. He had  been  of  good  character  whilst
      living here and did not pose any threat to the security of the UK. His
      private life amounted to living here in order to take  employment  and
      send money home to his wife and children in Turkey. They  were  living
      in the family home in Turkey. His private life  was  not  such  as  to
      engage questions of moral physical integrity. Although he had  claimed
      otherwise the appellant would be able to find some sort of  employment
      in Turkey. There might be some initial difficulty in reintegrating but
      in the past he had been employed in Turkey. The family might be better
      off with the  money  he  could  send  from  the  UK  rather  than  his
      employment in Turkey. The First-Tier Tribunal concluded  that,  whilst
      the appellant's situation was  unusual,  the  circumstances  were  not
      exceptional in the MF sense. It was concluded  that  the  respondent's
      decision was in accordance with the law and  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
      dismissed the appeal.


   6. The appellant applied for permission to appeal.  The  application  was
      out of time  but  the  Designated  Immigration  Judge  considered  and
      accepted the explanation and extended time before granting  permission
      to appeal. The grounds submit that the First-Tier  Tribunal  erred  in
      law in two ways. Firstly, by failing to consider whether  the  offence
      for which the appellant was convicted in his absence was sufficient to
      form  the  basis  for  making  a  deportation  order.   Secondly,   by
      incorrectly applying an "exceptionality" test.


   7. The appellant's representatives have submitted a new bundle running to
      109 pages much of which is new  material  not  before  the  First-Tier
      Tribunal. Mr Collins accepted that this new material was not  relevant
      to the question of whether the First-Tier Tribunal erred  in  law  and
      only fell be considered if we concluded that there was an error of law
      and set aside the decision.


   8. In relation to the first ground of appeal Mr Collins accepted that the
      respondent did not err in making the deportation order.  This  was  an
      appropriate concession. The basis for making the deportation order was
      not challenged at the hearing before the First-Tier Tribunal where the
      appellant relied  on  Article  8  grounds  only.  The  respondent  was
      entitled to conclude that deportation was in the public interest given
      that the appellant had committed a criminal offence abroad and  served
      a custodial sentence in  respect  of  that  offence.  The  passage  at
      paragraph 15.29 of Macdonald's Immigration Law and Practice  to  which
      the grounds refer states; "the commission of offences abroad might  be
      a ground for a public good deportation, so long as it is not disguised
      extradition and does not breach the persons human rights". Mr  Collins
      could not find any authority which provided further guidance. This  is
      a case where the appellant was convicted of serious offences in Turkey
      and the conviction was reviewed by a higher court in Turkey. There  is
      no question of the deportation order  being  a  disguised  extradition
      because extradition has already taken place, the appellant has  served
      his sentence in Turkey and returned to the UK. The First-Tier Tribunal
      went on to consider whether there was  a  breach  of  the  appellant's
      human rights.


   9. In paragraphs 43 to 46 of MF the Master of the Rolls said;


         "43. The word "exceptional" is often used to denote a departure
         from a general rule. The general rule in the present context is
         that, in the case of a foreign prisoner to whom paras 399 and 399A
         do not apply, very compelling reasons will be required to outweigh
         the public interest in deportation. These compelling reasons are
         the "exceptional circumstances".


         44. We would, therefore, hold that the new rules are a complete
         code and that the exceptional circumstances to be considered in the
         balancing exercise involve the application of a proportionality
         test as required by the Strasbourg jurisprudence. We accordingly
         respectfully do not agree with the UT that the decision-maker is
         not "mandated or directed" to take all the relevant article 8
         criteria into account (para 38).


         45. Even if we were wrong about that, it would be necessary to
         apply a proportionality test outside the new rules as was done by
         the UT. Either way, the result should be the same. In these
         circumstances, it is a sterile question whether this is required by
         the new rules or it is a requirement of the general law. What
         matters is that it is required to be carried out if paras 399 or
         399A do not apply.


         46. There has been debate as to whether there is a one stage or two
         stage test. If the claimant succeeds on an application of the new
         rules at the first hurdle ie he shows that para 399 or 399A
         applies, then it can be said that he has succeeded on a one stage
         test. But if he does not, it is necessary to consider whether there
         are circumstances which are sufficiently compelling (and therefore
         exceptional) to outweigh the public interest in deportation. That
         is an exercise which is separate from a consideration of whether
         para 399 or 399A applies. It is the second part of a two stage
         approach which, for the reasons we have given, is required by the
         new rules. The UT concluded (para 41) that it is required because
         the new rules do not fully reflect Strasbourg jurisprudence. But
         either way, it is necessary to carry out a two stage process."

  10. We find that the First-Tier Tribunal did not apply an  erroneous  test
      which was limited to  "exceptional",  "exceptional  circumstances"  or
      "exceptionality". In paragraph 30 the First-Tier  Tribunal  said;  "Of
      course, we use the term  "exceptional  circumstances"  in  the  manner
      illuminated by the Court of Appeal in MF". In the final assessment and
      the conclusions in paragraph 32 both references to "exceptional"  were
      "in the MF sense" and "the circumstances considered in MF". As this is
      a case where the appellant  could  not  benefit  from  the  Article  8
      provisions of the Immigration Rules the  First-Tier  Tribunal  applied
      the  correct  test  by  going  on  to  consider  whether  there   were
      circumstances sufficiently compelling (and therefore  exceptional)  to
      outweigh the public interest in deportation. Mr Collins submitted that
      the First-Tier Tribunal should have exercised real  caution.  We  find
      that this was done. All the relevant facts were properly considered in
      the context of the Article 8 analysis.


  11. The First-Tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction.  We  have
      not been asked to make such a direction and can see no good reason  to
      do so.


  12. We find that the First-Tier Tribunal did not err in law and we  uphold
      the determination.
