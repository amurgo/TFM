For the Respondent:    Ms A Jones, Counsel instructed by Farani Javid
Taylor Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 6 July  1984  and  he
       appeals against the decision of the Secretary of State dated 6 August
       2013 to  refuse,  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
       Regulations ((EEA) 2006, to  issue  him  with  a  residence  card  as
       confirmation of his right of residence in the UK as the spouse of  an
       EEA national exercising treaty rights in the UK.

    2. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P J Clarke allowed his appeal on  28
       February 2014 but an error of law was found in that determination  by
       Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Grimes on 13 June 2014 on the basis  that
       the judge erred in  considering  the  circumstances  of  whether  the
       appellant's wife was a jobseeker or a worker within Regulation  6  at
       the date of the appeal rather than at the date of the hearing.

    3. Had the judge considered the circumstances at the date of the hearing
       that he was required to do he could not reasonably  have  found  that
       the  evidence  from  over  a  year  previously  could  establish  the
       appellant's wife seeking work at the date of the hearing.   This  was
       particularly the case in the light of the appellant's  oral  evidence
       that his wife was working for an agency in August or September 2013.

    4. The Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge set  aside  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge's  decision  but  the  parties  agreed  that  the  findings  at
       paragraph 11, 12, 13 and the first three sentences  of  paragraph  14
       should be preserved.  These were as follows:

       "11.   I found the Appellant a credible  witness.   However,  I  have
           been hampered by the absence of evidence from the  Sponsor,  for
           understandable reasons.  Since most of this  appeal  relates  to
           her situation, I rely only on official documents which show what
           she has been doing in this country.

       12.    He is seeking a residence card as evidence  of  his  right  to
           reside as a family member of an EEA national.   I  find,  first,
           that the Appellant married Ms Jadach (an EEA national)  in  2008
           but  that  the  couple  have  not  lived  together  since  2009.
           However, they are still married, and the  Appellant  is  thus  a
           spouse: [1985] Diatta v Land Berlin [1985] ECR 567 at [20].   It
           is irrelevant that the marriage is  no  longer  subsisting;  and
           there is no suggestion that  the  marriage  is  or  was  one  of
           convenience.

       13.    The main issue before me is whether M Jadach  is  a  qualified
           person.  I am not satisfied that she is now a worker;  the  only
           evidence  I  have  is  the  oral  statement  of  the  Appellant,
           unsupported by documents; and I do not consider that sufficient.

       14.    The appeal was argued on the basis that Ms Jadach  is  a  job-
           seeker, and satisfies the requirements of paragraph 6(2) of  the
           regulations.  The paragraph requires that she is [present tense]
           in  duly  recorded  involuntary  employment  after  having  been
           employed in the UK.   I  am  satisfied  as  to  this:  there  is
           evidence that she registered as  a  jobseeker  on  1st  November
           2012, and was still so registered on 17th  December  2012.   The
           Appellant's  application  was  made  on  18th   January,   2013,
           therefore  material  after  that  date  could  not   have   been
           submitted.  I also gain mild support  from  this  view  that  Ms
           Jadach was to register at Northampton  College  for  courses  by
           13th January 2013."

    5. At the hearing before me, Mr Hopkin and Miss Jones both  agreed  that
       the one issue was a narrow  issue  as  to  whether  the  wife  was  a
       qualified person for the purpose of the EEA  Regulations  as  at  the
       date of the hearing before me on 10 September 2014.

    6. Ms Jones submitted that there was no further evidence.

    7. The appellant had previously adopted his statement and stated that in
       examination-in-chief that the last time he had contact with his  wife
       was via a text message on 28 August 2014 but  she  had  not  replied.
       When he gave evidence in Birmingham on 17 February she had  told  him
       that she was applying for jobs before the hearing date but he had not
       spoken to her since.

    8. Ms Jones  confirmed  that  the  last  document  in  relation  to  the
       appellant's wife at work was that of December  2012  and  Mr  Hopkins
       agreed that it was on 17 December 2012.  He submitted that there  was
       no clear evidence that she was in the UK and that she may or may  not
       be seeking work.

    9. The appellant had failed to discharge the burden of proof.

       Conclusions

   10. The appeal was argued on the basis that Ms Jadach  the  EEA  national
       was a worker or a jobseeker.

   11. The  following  documents  were  produced  relating  to  Ms  Jadach's
       employment and job-seeking:

       (a)    P45 from Monitor Hygiene Services, Northfleet, showing her  as
           leaving on 10th December 2007 with earnings  of  �8405  in  that
           employment.  [She states in her CV that  she  worked  here  from
           10th January 2007 to 29th December 2007].

       (b)    P45 from City Centre Restaurants UK, showing  her  leaving  on
           13th October 2008, with earnings  of  �4200.   [In  her  CV  she
           stated that she was working at the Bridge Bar from 8th May  2008
           - 5th October 2008].

       (c)    Employment and Support Allowance Claim dated 15th April  2009,
           showing that she received ESA until 2nd February 2009.

       (d)     Accession  State  Worker  Registration  Scheme   Registration
           Certificate dated 17th June 2010, showing her as employed at the
           Park Inn Hotel, Northampton.  [Her CV shows her as working there
           from 16th March 2010 to 25th September 2010].

       (e)    On 3rd December 2012  she  had  an  interview  at  Northampton
           Jobcentre Plus; she was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance from
           1st November 2012 "and ongoing".  The documents showed  she  was
           seeking work for office work, bar work,  restaurant;  also  that
           she  was  looking   for   jobs   as   a   warehouse   operative,
           picker/packer.  She could work 40 hours a week, and was prepared
           to work between 9am and 10pm on any day (weekends included)  not
           more than 8 hours a day.  On 17th December 2012, he stated in  a
           document  prepared  by  the  Jobcentre  that  she  would  go  to
           Northampton College to  apply  for  an  English,  Maths  and  IT
           course, by 13th January 2013.

   12. There is no evidence  that  Ms  Jadach  was  working  save  for  that
       evidence presented by the appellant at the former Tribunal  that  she
       had a job in August 2013.  This was not supported by documentation.

   13. The findings of Judge P J Clarke confirmed  that  the  only  evidence
       showing that the wife was a worker was  the  oral  statement  of  the
       appellant and as this  was  unsupported  by  documents,  it  was  not
       sufficient.  I agree.

   14. That the appellant was registered as a jobseeker on 1  November  2012
       and was still so registered on 17 December 2012 does not  assist  the
       appellant in showing that she the  sponsor,  an  EEA  national  is  a
       qualified person.

   15. The only documentation to suggest that the sponsor  was  a  jobseeker
       related to December 2012 when the EEA national had  an  interview  at
       the Northampton Jobcentre and was in receipt of Jobseekers  allowance
       from 1 November 2012.  On 17 December there was a  document  prepared
       by the Jobcentre that she would go to Northampton  College  to  apply
       for an English Maths and IT course by 13 January 2013.

   16. Further to Regulation 6(2) a person who is no  longer  working  shall
       not cease to be treated as a worker for the purpose  of  paragraph  6
       but for clarification I will set out the relevant regulation below.

   17. 6
          (2)
              1(b) if -

                "(a)   He is temporarily unable to work as the result of  an
                    illness or accident;

                (b)    He is in duly recorded involuntary unemployment after
                    having been employed in the United Kingdom for at  least
                    one year provided that he -

                   (i) has registered  as  a  jobseeker  with  the  relevant
                    office; and

                   (ii)     satisfies condition (A) and (B)."

                ....

           (4) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), a "jobseeker" is a
           person who satisfies conditions  A, B and, where relevant, C

           (5) Condition A is that the person-

                (a)    entered the United Kingdom in order to seek
                    employment; or

                (b)     is present in the United Kingdom seeking employment,
                    immediately after enjoying a right to reside pursuant to
                    paragraph (1)(b) to (e) (disregarding any period during
                    which worker status was retained pursuant to paragraph
                    (2)(b) or (ba)).

           (6) Condition B is that the person can provide evidence that he
           is seeking employment and has a genuine chance of being engaged.

           (7) A person may not retain the status of a worker pursuant to
           paragraph (2)(b), or jobseeker pursuant to paragraph (1)(a), for
           longer than the relevant period  unless he can provide
           compelling evidence that he is continuing to seek employment and
           has a genuine chance of being engaged.

           (8) In paragraph (7), "the relevant period" means-

                (a)     in the case of a person retaining worker status
                    pursuant to paragraph (2)(b), a continuous period of six
                    months;

                (b)     in the case of a jobseeker, 182 days, minus the
                    cumulative total of any days during which the person
                    concerned previously enjoyed a right to reside as a
                    jobseeker, not include any days prior to a continuous
                    absence from the United Kingdom of at least 12 months.

   18. The appellant's sponsor is last recorded as  working  in  documentary
       evidence, as opposed to the oral evidence which is  insufficient,  in
       September 2010 [Park Inn Hotel Northampton].  Even  if  the  sponsor,
       and thus the appellant, is not caught by Condition A, whereby she may
       only retain worker status for a maximum of six months because she has
       been employed in the UK for less than a year, there was  no  evidence
       to show that she had fulfilled condition B such that  she  was  still
       and at the relevant time seeking employment and had a genuine  change
       of being engaged.  The last documentary evidence in relation  to  the
       appellant's sponsor activity was that she was going onto a course  in
       January 2013.  The First Tier Tribunal Judge  found  she  was  a  job
       seeker in January 2013 but this is not relevant to the  date  of  the
       hearing. There was indeed no evidence that she was present in the  UK
       contrary to Condition A and no evidence that  she  is  continuing  to
       seek work or that she had embarked on a vocational training course

   19. There was no evidence, save for the appellant's oral evidence that he
       had understood the sponsor was working in the August 2013 and looking
       for a job in February 2014.  I find there is unsatisfactory  evidence
       to show that the sponsor was a jobseeker or that she was even in  the
       country.  There  was  no  evidence  as  to  how  long  she  had  been
       unemployed and as such I find the appellant  cannot  succeed  on  the
       appeal under the EEA Regulations.

   20. I note that  the  appellant  appealed  further  to  Article  8.   The
       appellant cannot comply with the Immigration Rules under Appendix  FM
       as a family  life  had  not  been  engaged,  through  a  genuine  and
       subsisting relationship as he no longer lives  with  his  wife.   The
       appellant and his ex-wife had  not  lived  together  since  2009  and
       although they planned to live together after 2011 they had  not  done
       so.  There was no evidence of another girlfriend.

   21. Nor can he comply with Paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  He
       has not lived in the United Kingdom for 20 years nor  lived  most  of
       his life in the United Kingdom.  He first entered the UK  as  a  work
       permit holder in 2002 as a professional  cricketer  and  returned  in
       2003 on a similar permit, when he was 19 years  old.   The  appellant
       was then granted entry clearance as a student and  further  leave  to
       remain until November 2008.  He met the EEA sponsor in 2007 and  they
       started living together in November 2007.  They married  on  8  March
       2008.  In January 2009 the appellant was  arrested  and  was  charged
       with having raped his wife and remanded in custody but at  the  Crown
       Court on 24 June 2009 the police offered no evidence.  The  appellant
       was further granted leave to remain as a student on 11 July 2012.  He
       had entered the UK first in 2002 and then in 2003 has been living  in
       the UK for nearly twelve years as at the date of the hearing.

   22. On consideration of the facts, I  do  not  consider  that  there  are
       arguably  good  grounds  for  considering  the  matter  outside   the
       Immigration Rules but even if I am wrong about that I have considered
       the questions in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, in line with R(MM  (Lebanon))
       v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ  985.   The  appellant  has  established  some
       private life, as described above, in the UK and I accept  further  to
       AG (Eritrea) [2007] EWCA Civ 801 that  the  test  for  engagement  of
       private life is not particularly high.  He  had  studied  in  the  UK
       obtaining various qualifications and has formed relationships and has
       been involved in the community activities, notably cricket.

   23. I accept that the decision  to refuse him  a  residence  card  is  in
       accordance with the law and would be for a legitimate aim, namely the
       protection  of  rights  and  freedoms  of  others  through  effective
       immigration control.   I am bound to have regard to  Section  117  of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  which  identifies
       that "the public interest question" means the question of whether  an
       interference with a person's right to respect for private and  family
       life is justified under Article 8(2).  There has been no decision  to
       remove the appellant although his  removal  is  contemplated  in  the
       refusal letter and his appeal was framed in relation to Article 8.  I
       take into account that he has  not  previously  breached  Immigration
       Rules and has not been convicted of any offence although  appears  to
       have spent some time on remand for rape.  Albeit  he  had  spent  the
       majority of  the  last  thirteen  years  in  the  UK,  appellant  has
       continuously returned to  Pakistan,  notably  in  December  2009  and
       September 2011, and cannot have had any  firm  expectation  of  being
       able to remain in the UK.   He came here to study and has done so.

   24. The appellant stated that he had finished  his  diploma  in  business
       management and waiting for results and I find that  he  has  improved
       his employment prospects  by  obtaining  qualifications  in  the  UK.
       There was no information placed before me  to  the  effect  that  the
       appellant cannot renew his life in Pakistan.  He speaks the  language
       and was educated in his formative years in Pakistan.

   25. Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11

       'In an article 8 case where this question is  reached,  the  ultimate
       question for the  appellate  immigration  authority  is  whether  the
       refusal of leave to enter or remain, in circumstances where the  life
       of the family cannot reasonably be expected to be enjoyed  elsewhere,
       taking full account of all considerations weighing in favour  of  the
       refusal, prejudices the family life of  the  applicant  in  a  manner
       sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the  fundamental  right
       protected  by  article  8.  If  the  answer  to  this   question   is
       affirmative, the refusal  is  unlawful  and  the  authority  must  so
       decide. It is not necessary that the appellate immigration authority,
       directing itself along the lines indicated in this opinion, need  ask
       in addition whether the case meets a test of exceptionality'.

   26. I find that the decision to  refuse  his  appeal  has  not  seriously
       prejudiced any Article 8 rights the appellant may have and the appeal
       is dismissed under both the  EEA  Regulations  and  on  human  rights
       grounds.

Deputy Judge of the First-tier Tribunal


Fee Award: I have dismissed the appeal and therefore there  can  be  no  fee
    award.
