Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Pearce of Avon & Bristol Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 19 February 1967.
     He appeals against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  G  C
    Solly) which dismissed his appeal on human rights grounds  against  the
    respondent's decision dated 25 July 2016 to refuse him indefinite leave
    to remain ("ILR") based upon ten  years'  continuous  lawful  residence
    under para 276B of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 2. Permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Pooler) on 17 January 2018.

The Appellant's Immigration History

 3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom  on  21  September  2005  with
    entry clearance as a student nurse valid until 19 February 2006.   That
    leave expired before the appellant made an application, out of time, on
    18 March  2006  for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  student.   This
    application was successful and leave was granted  from  20  April  2006
    until 30 April 2007.

 4.  On  2  October  2016,  the  appellant  applied  for  a  "transfer   of
    conditions".  This appears to have been treated as an  application  for
    further leave and leave was granted to the appellant  from  1  November
    2006 until 15 March 2010.  Although  the  Secretary  of  State  in  her
    decision letter recognised that this had  been  done  "in  error",  the
    Secretary of State acknowledged that the appellant had leave to  remain
    until 15 March 2010.

 5. On 8 March 2010, the appellant applied for further leave to remain as a
    spouse.  This application was  refused  on  18  May  2010  and,  it  is
    accepted, the appellant's leave expired two working days  later  on  20
    May 2010.

 6. On 12 June 2010, the appellant applied out of time for further leave as
    a spouse.  This was refused on 10 March 2011.  Following a request  for
    a reconsideration and a consent order in  judicial  review  proceedings
    brought by the appellant, the Secretary of State agreed  to  reconsider
    the decision.  On 28 September 2011, the Secretary of State  maintained
    her refusal to grant the appellant leave as a spouse  but  also,  in  a
    decision served on 29 November 2011, made  a  decision  to  remove  the
    appellant.  That was appealable and on 13 October 2011,  the  appellant
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  On 24 November 2011,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge A D Baker) allowed the appellant's appeal on human
    rights grounds, under Art 8  of  the  ECHR.   Subsequently,  and  as  I
    understand it as a result of that  decision,  the  Secretary  of  State
    granted the appellant discretionary leave from 30 March 2012  until  30
    May 2015.

 7. On 20 May 2015, the appellant  applied,  in  time,  for  further  leave
    outside the Rules.  The application was refused on  1  September  2015.
    The appellant appealed  on  14  September  2015  but  that  appeal  was
    withdrawn on 8 March 2016 as a result of a request made on 5 March 2016
    to vary the consideration of his earlier application as one  now  under
    para 276B  of  the  Rules  based  upon  ten  years'  continuous  lawful
    residence.

 8. It is clear from this chronology, and was  common  ground  between  the
    parties before me, that there are two 'gaps' in the  appellant's  leave
    covering the ten-year period between 21 September 2005 and 21 September
    2015.  Those 'gaps' are between 20 February 2006 and 19 April 2006  and
    further between 21 May 2010 and 30 March 2012.

 9. In his decision dated 25 July 2016, the Secretary  of  State  concluded
    that each of those periods of time when  the  appellant  did  not  have
    leave to remain in the  UK  broke  the  period  of  "continuous  lawful
    residence" as defined in para 276A.  Each exceeded 28 days and so could
    not be disregarded under para 276B(v).  As a consequence, the appellant
    could not establish "at least ten years' continuous lawful residence in
    the United Kingdom" so as to meet the requirements of para 276B.

The Long Residence Rule

10. The 'long residence' rule is found in para 276B  (with  definitions  in
    para 276A) of the Rules.  Para 276B provides, inter alia, as follows:

         "276B.   The requirements to be met by an applicant for  indefinite
                  leave to remain on the grounds of lawful residence in  the
                  United Kingdom are that:

                  (i)  (a) he has had at least 10 years'  continuous  lawful
                           residence in the United Kingdom.

                  ....."

11. Para 276A defines "lawful residence", so far as relevant, as meaning:

         "residence which is continuous residence pursuant to:

         (i)  existing leave to enter or remain; ..."

12. Further it defines "continuous residence" as meaning:

         "residence in the United Kingdom for an unbroken  period,  and  for
         these purposes a period shall not be considered to have been broken
         where an applicant is absent from the United Kingdom for  a  period
         of 6 months or less at any one time, provided that the applicant in
         question has existing limited leave to enter or remain  upon  their
         departure and return, ...."

13. Read alone, therefore, the effect of these  provisions  would  be  that
    either period during which the appellant  did  not  have  lawful  leave
    would have the effect of preventing him establishing that  he  had  ten
    years' lawful continuous residence in the UK.

14. Para 276B, however, contains a provision in sub-para (v)  which  allows
    for periods of overstaying to be disregarded.

15. It is necessary to set out two versions of sub-para (v) as it  was,  at
    least initially, an issue before me as to which version was  applicable
    to this appeal.

16. The provision in force for applications made before  24  November  2016
    provided as follows:

         "(v) the applicant must not be in the UK in breach  of  immigration
             laws, except that any period of overstaying for a period of 28
             days or less will  be  disregarded,  as  will  any  period  of
             overstaying between periods of entry clearance, leave to enter
             or leave to remain  of  up  to  28  days  and  any  period  of
             overstaying pending the determination of an  application  made
             within that 28 day period."

17. HC 667 substituted a new sub-para (v) for applications made on or after
    24 November 2016 and is as follows:

         "(v) the applicant must not be in the UK in breach  of  immigration
             laws, except that, where paragraph 39E of these Rules applies,
             any current period of overstaying will  be  disregarded.   Any
             previous period of overstaying between periods of  leave  will
             also be disregarded where -

             (a)  the further application was made before 24 November  2016
                  and within 28 days of the expiry of leave; or

             (b)  the further application was made on or after 24  November
                  2016 and paragraph 39E of these Rules applied."

18. The latter provision was relied upon  in  the  appellant's  grounds  of
    appeal upon which permission was  granted,  although  Judge  Pooler  in
    granting  permission  raised  the  issue  of  whether  the  substituted
    provision effected by HC 667 was the correct and applicable one to  the
    appeal.

19. Before me, there was some discussion between  the  representatives  and
    myself as to the  applicable  provision.   Initially,  Ms  Pearce,  who
    represented the appellant, relied upon the substituted version of  sub-
    para (v).  However, on obtaining a copy of HC 667, it  became  apparent
    that the implementation provisions brought into effect  the  substitute
    version of sub-para (v) only in respect of  "applications  made  on  or
    after 24 November 2016".   Both  representatives,  on  considering  the
    implementation provisions in HC 667, accepted that it was  the  earlier
    version of sub-para (v) that applied to this appeal as the  appellant's
    application for ILR had been made before 24 November 2016,  namely  (by
    variation  of  his  application)  on  5  March  2016.    The   parties'
    submission, thereafter, focused  on  the  application  of  the  earlier
    version of sub-para (v) to the judge's decision and the facts  of  this
    appeal.

Discussion

20. As will be clear from that sub-para periods of overstaying of "up to 28
    days" between  periods  of  leave  will  be  disregarded  as  will  any
    additional periods of overstaying  "pending  the  determination  of  an
    application" which has been made within that initial 28-day  period  of
    overstaying.

21. Applying that to the accepted facts of this  appeal,  Mr  Howells,  who
    represented the Secretary of State, accepted that the  judge  had  been
    correct to conclude that the  first  'gap'  in  the  appellant's  leave
    between 20 February 2006 and 19 April 2006 was correctly disregarded by
    the judge.  He accepted that the judge's reasoning in para  20  of  her
    determination was correct.  There, the judge said this:

         "20. The first gap alleged was between  20  February  2006  and  19
             April 2006.  The respondent's immigration history says that on
             18 March 2006 the appellant applied further leave to remain as
             a student.  Given that this is the date of  application  given
             by the respondent I accept as being accurate.  His  period  of
             entry clearance had expired on  19  February  2006.   The  gap
             between 19 February 2006 and 18 March 2006 is 28 days or less.
              This  period  does  not  break  the  10  years  period  given
             paragraph 276B(v) of the Immigration Rules."

22. I agree.  20 February 2006 (when the  appellant's  previous  leave  had
    expired) to 18 March 2006 (when he next applied for further leave) is a
    period of  less  than  28  days  and  during  that  initial  period  of
    overstaying of 28 days the appellant made an  application  for  further
    leave.  By virtue of sub-para (v), the  entire  period  of  overstaying
    "pending the determination"  of  that  application  is  disregarded  in
    calculating whether the appellant has established ten years' continuous
    lawful residence.  He was, of course, granted  further  leave  from  20
    April 2006.  The effect of sub-para (v) is, as the judge  concluded  in
    para 20 of the determination, that the period of 20 February 2006 to 19
    April 2006 is disregarded as a period of overstaying when the appellant
    did not, in fact, have leave to remain.

23. There was, however, a continued  dispute  between  the  parties  as  to
    whether the judge had reached a correct conclusion in  respect  of  the
    second 'gap' between 21 May 2010 (when the appellant's  leave  expired)
    and 30 March 2012 (when the appellant was  next  granted  discretionary
    leave).

24. The judge's reasoning is found at paras 21 - 25 of her determination as
    follows:

         "21. The second gap alleged is between 21 May  2010  and  29  March
             2012.  On 12 June 2010 he applied for leave to remain  as  the
             sponsor of a person present and settled in  the  UK.   I  find
             that this gap between 21 May 2010 and 12 June  2010  was  less
             than  the  28  days  allowed  by  paragraph  276B(v)  of   the
             Immigration Rules.

         22.  This application was refused on 2 March 2011 with no right  of
             appeal.  A reconsideration was requested (the date of which is
             not provided to me) and on 28 September 2011 the decision  was
             maintained.  A pre-action protocol letter  was  issued  and  a
             judicial review application raised.  I am not given  the  date
             of either.  An appeal on 13 October 2011, heard on 14 November
             2011 before Immigration Judge  Baker,  was  allowed  on  human
             rights  ground  on  24  November  2011.   The  appellant   was
             subsequently granted discretionary leave from 30 March 2012 to
             30 May 2015.

         23.  I am satisfied his that the appellant had adequate leave  from
             13 October 2011 to 29 March 2012 as this is  a  period  within
             which he was appealing.

         24.  This therefore leaves the period  from  3  March  2011  to  12
             October 2011.  The appellant's representative has  applied  to
             the respondent's case records which commence on page 16 of the
             appellant's bundle and there is a note (dated on page 17 as  1
             March 2011) in which the case handler says that it is proposed
             to refuse the application.  The next note is dated 10 May 2011
             and says PAP letter received.  I take this to be a  pre-action
             protocol letter.

         25.  On 2 March 2011  according  to  the  immigration  history  the
             application was refused.  The pre-action protocol  letter  had
             been received by 10 May 2011 and the gap between the two  days
             is well over 28 days.  I accordingly  find  that  this  period
             breaks the 10 year lawful residence."

25. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Howells accepted that the effect of sub-
    para (v) was to disregard the period between  21  May  2010  (when  his
    leave expired on 20 May 2010) and 28 September 2011 (when the Secretary
    of State following the judicial  review  proceedings  reconsidered  the
    appellant's application for further leave made  on  12  June  2010  and
    maintained it so as to refuse him leave).  He submitted that,  applying
    the wording of sub-para (v)  the  appellant  had  made  an  application
    within the initial 28-day period of overstaying (which began on 21  May
    2010)  and  that  application  was,  in  effect,  "pending"  until  the
    Secretary of State's decision on 28 September 2011.  Thereafter, it was
    no longer "pending" even though the appellant had  a  right  of  appeal
    against the  separate  decision  to  remove  him  made  at  that  time.
    Consequently, there was a break in the appellant's lawful residence  in
    the UK from around 28 September 2011 (bearing in mind  the  application
    was not determined until it was served) and 30 March 2012 when,  albeit
    as a result of  the  intervening  appeal,  the  appellant  was  granted
    discretionary leave until 30 May 2015.

26. Ms Pearce submitted that the effect of sub-para (v) was to require that
    the appellant's overstaying from 31 May 2010 be disregarded  until  the
    conclusion of his appeal on 24 November 2011 (or,  at  least,  fourteen
    days later when no appeal could be brought in time by the  respondent).
    She accepted, however, that from update, namely 8 December  2011  until
    29 March 2012 there was a period when the appellant did not have  leave
    to enter or remain and which was not properly  disregarded  under  sub-
    para (v).

27. In my judgment, Mr Howell's  submissions  are  correct.   Sub-para  (v)
    creates two potential periods of time during  which  an  individual  is
    overstaying but which "will be disregarded" in calculating  whether  he
    has established a period of ten  years'  continuous  lawful  residence.
    Both periods must occur between periods of leave  when  the  individual
    has overstayed.  The first period is a period of up to  28  days.   The
    second period is a period of  an  undetermined  number  of  days  where
    during the initial 28-day period of overstaying the individual makes an
    application  for  leave.   In  those  circumstances,  the   period   of
    overstaying which  "will  be  disregarded"  is  extended  "pending  the
    determination"  of  that  application.    Once   the   application   is
    determined, sub-para (v) ceases to have any effect.  Of course, if as a
    result of the determination  of  the  application,  the  individual  is
    granted further leave from that date then the whole of  the  period  of
    overstaying "will be disregarded".  Where leave  is  not  granted  with
    effect from the date the application is determined (and that  was  this
    case) but subsequently leave is granted to the individual from a future
    date, there will remain a period of overstaying which sub-para (v) does
    not permit to be "disregarded".

28. It seems to me  that  the  phrase  "pending  the  determination  of  an
    application" means what it says.  An application is "pending" until  it
    is decided.  Once a decision is  made,  then,  the  application  is  no
    longer "pending".  On the facts of this case, Mr Howells accepted  that
    the application made on 12 June 2010 was "pending" until it was finally
    determined on 28 September 2011 (or, at least, two days thereafter when
    it is deemed to be served upon the appellant).

29. Ms Pearce sought to overcome this apparent effect of  sub-para  (v)  by
    contending that by analogy to s.3C of  the  Immigration  Act  1971  the
    application should be considered not to be determined - and, therefore,
    to remain "pending" - until the appeal proceedings brought against  the
    decision of 28 September 2011  were  concluded.   She  submitted  that,
    otherwise, the effect of sub-para (v) would produce an anomalous effect
    namely that an individual's overstaying  would  not  be  "disregarded",
    despite a  successful  appeal,  where  an  application  was  determined
    adversely to him despite a successful appeal.  She submitted  that,  as
    s.3C of the Immigration Act 1971 continued the leave of  an  individual
    until the conclusion of appeal proceedings, so by analogy sub-para  (v)
    should be interpreted to extend the period for which overstaying  would
    be "disregarded" until the end of appeal proceedings.

30. Ms Pearce's submission is not without some attraction.  In the  result,
    however, I do not accept her submission which, in my  judgment,  simply
    run contrary to the plain wording of sub-para (v).

31. Section 3C of the Immigration Act deals with the continuation of  leave
    pending a variation decision.  It deals  with  the  position  where  an
    individual with leave seeks further leave but,  before  a  decision  is
    made by the Secretary of State, the existing  grant  of  leave  expires
    (s.3C(1)).  In practical terms, applications for further leave are made
    relatively close in time to the expiry of existing leave and, if for no
    reason other than pressure of work, a  decision  by  the  Secretary  of
    State is likely to be reached after the  existing  leave  has  expired.
    The underlying purpose of s.3C is to ensure that an individual  is  not
    prejudiced by  that  "practicality"  which  would  leave  them  in  the
    position of being an overstayer.  It,  therefore,  statutorily  extends
    the  individual's  existing  leave  beyond  the  point  when  it  would
    naturally expire.  Section 3C(2) extends the leave as follows:

         "(2) the leave is extended by virtue of  this  section  during  any
         period when -

             (a)  the application for  variation  is  neither  decided  nor
                  withdrawn,

             (b)  an appeal under s.82(1) of the  Nationality,  Asylum  and
                  Immigration Act 2002 could be brought while the  appellant
                  is in the United  Kingdom  against  the  decision  on  the
                  application for variation (ignoring any possibility of  an
                  appeal out of time with permission),

             (c)  an  appeal  under  that  section  against  the  decision,
                  brought while the appellant is in the United  Kingdom,  is
                  pending (within the meaning of Section 104 of  that  Act),
                  or

             (d)   an  administrative  review  of  the  decision   on   the
                  application for variation -

                  (i)  could be brought, or

                  (ii) is pending".

32. In summary, an individual's leave, when an in-time  application  for  a
    variation of that leave is made, is extended beyond the period when  it
    would otherwise expire to:

          i) the  date  when  that  application  is  decided  or  withdrawn
             (s.3C(2)(a)); and

         ii) during any period when an in-country  appeal  may  be  brought
             against the decision (excluding the possibility of an  out  of
             time appeal) (s.3C(2)(b)); and

        iii) if such an appeal is brought or such time as  that  appeal  is
             "pending" which, by virtue of s.104 of the 2002 Act, is  until
             that appeal is "finally determined,  withdrawn  or  abandoned"
             (s.3C(2)(c))

         iv) during any period  when  an  administrative  review  could  be
             brought or is pending (s.3C(2)(d)).

33. It is, of course, obvious that  s.3C  is  concerned  with  an  entirely
    different issue to the one raised in this appeal.  It is concerned with
    a person who made an in-time application to vary  his  leave  but  upon
    which a decision is not reached during the  currency  of  his  existing
    leave.  The individual has done everything that he can  appropriate  to
    obtain further lawful leave.  By contrast, the  individual  who  relies
    upon sub-para (v) of para 276B has not sought further leave within  the
    currency of his existing leave but rather has overstayed and is seeking
    a 'condolence' of a period of overstaying.  He has not done all that he
    can to obtain further and unbroken leave to remain in the UK.

34. The wording of s.3C(2) is, in my judgment, instructive.  In effect,  Ms
    Pearce's submission seeks to read into sub-para (v) what is set out  in
    s.3C(2)(b) and (c) when, in effect, only what is found in s.3C(2)(a) is
    actually included in sub-para (v).  The sequential extension  of  leave
    affected by s.3C(2) begins with a period up to which the application is
    decided.  That is, in plain terms, what is said in sub-para (v) of para
    276B.  Ms Pearce however seeks to include within the  latter's  wording
    of "pending the determination of an application", a further period when
    an appeal could be brought against that  decision  (s.3C(2)(b))  and  a
    further  period  until  such  time  as   the   appeal   is   determined
    (s.3C(2)(c)).  If the interpretation urged upon me by Ms Pearce of sub-
    para (v) was correct, the further  periods  of  extension  set  out  in
    s.3C(2)(b) and (c) would  have  been  unnecessary  because  they  would
    already have been included within the wording in s.3C(2)(a).

35. In my judgment, had the Secretary of State  (and  Parliament)  intended
    the reach of sub-para (v) of para 276B to extend beyond the  "decision"
    on an  application,  the  wording  of  sub-para  (v)  would  have  been
    different and would have  reflected,  in  essence,  the  provisions  in
    s.3C(2)(b) and (c) of the Immigration Act 1971.  In  my  judgment,  the
    plain wording of sub-para (v) extends the period of  overstaying  which
    "will be disregarded" to the point when a  decision  is  made  upon  an
    application for further leave (itself made within  the  initial  28-day
    period of overstaying) but beyond that the  application  is  no  longer
    "pending".

36. Of course, it may well be that if an  application  is  successful,  the
    individual will, in any event, be granted leave backdated to an earlier
    point in time such that there may not be any 'gap' in his leave when  a
    retrospective gaze is cast over his immigration  history  to  determine
    whether he can establish ten years' continuous  lawful  residence.   In
    those circumstances, there is  no  need  to  rely  upon  sub-para  (v).
    However, if the grant of further leave is  backdated  to  the  date  of
    application or date of decision on that application, reliance upon sub-
    para (v) will be necessary to establish "continuous lawful residence".

37. Where, however, the application is unsuccessful but, as in  this  case,
    is successfully appealed, sub-para (v) properly interpreted,  may  well
    result  in  an  individual  overstaying  for  a  period  which  is  not
    "disregarded" for the purposes of para 276B.  That will be so where, as
    a result of the successful appeal, the individual is granted leave  but
    that is not backdated to the date of the application  or  the  date  on
    which the application - now in retrospect - was wrongly refused.  If it
    is granted only from the date of the successful appeal  or  some  later
    date, sub-para (v) will not allow the entire period of  overstaying  to
    be "disregarded".  That is precisely what happened in this case.  As  a
    result of the successful appeal to Judge Baker on 24 November 2011, the
    appellant was granted discretionary leave only from 30 March 2012.   He
    was not even granted leave from  the  date  on  which  the  appeal  was
    successful.  Mr Howells was unable to assist as to why the Secretary of
    State had only granted discretionary leave from 30 March  2012.   As  I
    have already noted, and Ms Pearce accepted in her submissions, even  on
    the basis she put the appellant's  case  before  me  there  remained  a
    period of overstaying which could not be "disregarded" from the date of
    Judge Baker's decision to 30 March 2012.  That  period  of  overstaying
    inevitably prevents the appellant from establishing  the  required  ten
    years' continuous lawful residence under para 276B.

38. Ms Pearce accepted that but invited me to conclude that the judge  had,
    in any event, wrongly applied sub-para (v) and, in doing so, had failed
    to take into account in assessing the appellant's claim under Art 8 the
    correct period which was to be "disregarded" under that  provision  and
    that, despite having succeeded in his appeal through no  fault  of  his
    own, and inexplicably, he had only not been granted  leave  until  30th
    March 2012.  She invited me to set aside the judge's decision and remit
    the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  to  reconsider  the  appellant's
    claim under Art 8 but in the light of the correct application  of  sub-
    para (v) and the inexplicable fact that leave was not granted until  30
    March 2012.

39. Although Mr Howells invited me to construe and apply  sub-para  (v)  so
    that the appellant's overstaying would only be "disregarded"  until  28
    September 2011 (plus 2 days for service), he agreed with Ms Pearce that
    the judge had  misapplied  sub-para  (v)  and  that  had  infected  her
    decision in respect of Art 8  outside  the  Rules.   He  accepted  that
    whether I accepted his or Ms Pearce's submissions  as  to  the  correct
    period of overstaying to be "disregarded", the judge's decision  should
    be set aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  to  reach  a  new
    decision on Art 8 outside the Rules in the light of my conclusions.

40. I have already set out my reasons for accepting Mr Howell's submissions
    on the proper interpretation and application of sub-para  (v)  of  para
    276B.  That period ended following the decision on his  application  on
    28 September 2011 (plus 2 days for service).

41. It is not clear whether Judge Solly applied the correct and  applicable
    version of sub-para (v)  or  the  more  recent  (and  current)  version
    substituted by HC 667.  The latter is not identical to  the  applicable
    version of sub-para (v).  There is  more  than  a  suspicion  that  her
    attention was directed towards the new version, not least  because  she
    was referred to the Secretary of State's guidance on  "long  residence"
    dated 3 April 2017 which deals with that new provision and also because
    her (then)  legal representatives clearly took the view in the  grounds
    of appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  that  the  case  turned  upon  the
    application of the version substituted by HC 667.  Whether she  did  or
    not, the judge's conclusions on the application of  sub-para  (v)  were
    not in accordance with the proper application of the applicable version
    of sub-para (v).

42. First, the judge found that the appellant had "adequate leave" from  13
    October 2011 to 29 March 2012 "as this is a period within which he  was
    appealing".  That is, with respect, wrong.  The appellant  at  no  time
    has had leave, adequate or otherwise, between 21  May  2010  (when  his
    existing  leave  expired)  and  30  March  2012  when  he  was  granted
    discretionary leave by the respondent.  It is not wholly clear why  the
    judge in para 23 concluded that he had leave during the period  of  the
    appeal process.  She may have had in mind the effect  of  s.3C  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971 but that had no application as the  appellant  had
    not made an in-time application before his leave expired on 20 May 2010
    to which s.3C could apply.  It would, in any event, have  only  applied
    to the point of time when the appeal process was concluded,  which  was
    fourteen days after the decision of Judge Baker on  24  November  2011,
    namely 8 December 2011.  There would still remain a gap from that  date
    until 30 March 2012.

43. Secondly, it is accepted by Mr Howells that the effect of sub-para  (v)
    required the period of the appellant's overstaying to be  "disregarded"
    up to the point when his application  for  further  leave  was  finally
    determined on 28 September 2011 (plus 2 days for service).   That  was,
    at least, accepted as a period covered by sub-para  (v)  by  Ms  Pearce
    and, as I have already concluded, the correct application  of  sub-para
    (v) on the basis that that was the date after which the application was
    no longer "pending". By contrast, the judge found that sub-para (v) did
    not apply to the period from 3 March 2011 to 12 October 2012 being  the
    period from when  the  application  was  initially  refused  until  the
    appellant lodged his appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the
    maintained decision on 28 September 2011 to refuse his application  and
    to make a removal decision.  Applying sub-para (v) correctly the  judge
    should have concluded that the period of  the  appellant's  overstaying
    which had to be "disregarded" was between 21 May 2010 and 28  September
    2011 (plus two days for service on the appellant).

44. For these reasons, therefore, the judge erred in law in her application
    of para 276B, in particular sub-para (v).   That  led  her  wrongly  to
    identify the period of overstaying which could be disregarded  for  the
    purposes of determining  whether  the  appellant  could  establish  ten
    years' continuous lawful residence in the UK.  Ms Pearce accepted,  and
    I agree, that the appellant could not establish the required ten years'
    continuous lawful residence so as to succeed  in  showing  he  met  the
    requirements of para 276B.  Preferring Mr Howells' submissions to those
    of  Ms  Pearce,  I  have  concluded  that  the  period  that  could  be
    disregarded was between 21 May 2010 and 28 September 2011 (plus 2  days
    for  service).   Thereafter,  however,  having  successfully   appealed
    against the respondent's refusal of leave, for reasons which  have  not
    been discernible  before  me,  the  Secretary  of  State  only  granted
    discretionary leave from 30 March 2012 leaving  the  appellant  with  a
    period from 30 September 2011 which,  inevitably,  broke  the  required
    period of ten years' continuous lawful residence.  That  was,  however,
    as Ms Pearce submitted a matter  wholly  outside  the  control  of  the
    appellant.  Both the period  of  overstaying  and  the  fact  that  the
    appellant was successful on appeal but not (inexplicably) granted leave
    until later, were relevant in the judge's assessment of the appellant's
    claim under Art 8 outside the Rules.  I accept he submissions that  the
    judge's flawed findings infected her decision in respect of Art 8.

Decision

45. The judge's decision to dismiss the appeal involved the  making  of  an
    error of law.  I set aside the decision.

46. As I was invited by both representatives, I remit  the  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal (to be heard by a judge other than Judge Solly)  to
    remake the decision under Art 8 in the light of my conclusion as to the
    application of para 276B(v) to the appellant's immigration history  and
    having  regard  to  the  fact  that  the  appellant  was  only  granted
    discretionary leave, despite his successful appeal, from 30 March 2012.
