                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr K H Forrest, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Blair, promulgated on 22  November  2016.   There  has  been  delay  in
    processing the case to the stage of hearing in the UT,  but  that  does
    not now raise any issues for us to resolve.

 2. The FtT's decision records that an advocate appeared for the SSHD,  and
    that submissions were made by that advocate, but  parties  concur  that
    the SSHD was not represented.  The decision refers to a case  based  on
    honour killings, when no such case was advanced.  Parts of the decision
    are relevant to the appellant's case, but significant parts are not.

 3. The judge has unfortunately confused his notes, or his draft decisions,
    in two cases.  The outcome is a blend which cannot stand as  a  legally
    adequate explanation of why the appellant's case has failed.

 4. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  The nature of the case  is  such
    that it is appropriate under section 12 of  the  2007  Act,  and  under
    Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to  the  FtT  for  an  entirely  fresh
    hearing.

 5. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
