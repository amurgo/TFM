                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, instructed by Frew & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Greasley, promulgated on 15 April 2019.

 2. The respondent accepted that  there  had  been  procedural  unfairness,
    amounting to error of law, in that the FtT proceeded  at  [32]  on  the
    basis that additional photographic evidence had not been filed with the
    FtT or intimated to the respondent, and declined to admit and  consider
    that evidence.  In fact, the evidence had been filed and intimated.  Mr
    Govan conceded that the decision of the FtT should be set aside.   That
    is unfortunate, as the case has already been heard more than once,  but
    inevitable.

 3. Mr Govan sought, somewhat tentatively, to restrict the  extent  of  re-
    hearing to the  appellant's  sur  place  claim;  but  I  preferred  the
    submission by Mr Winter that  the  evidence  was  capable  of  a  wider
    bearing, and that an entirely fresh hearing was appropriate.

 4. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 5. The case is remitted to the FtT.  The member(s) of the  FtT  chosen  to
    consider the case are not to include Judge Greasley or Judge Wylie.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
