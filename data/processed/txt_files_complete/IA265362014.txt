Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M M Haque, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, born on 2 April 1991, is a citizen of Pakistan.

 2. He made an application  for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student together with a biometric residence permit under  the
    provisions of the points-based system.  That application was refused on
    10 June 2014.

 3. The appellant  appealed  and  in  a  determination  promulgated  on  24
    September 2014 Judge of the First-tier Stott dismissed the  appellant's
    appeal.

 4. Permission to appeal was  sought  essentially  on  two  grounds,  being
    fairness and a failure by the judge to deal with Article 8.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted on 12 November 2014 by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Saffer.   The  fourth  paragraph  of  his  decision
    states:-

         "4.  The grounds are arguable  as  the  Judge  has  made  a  wholly
             irrelevant suggestion as to how  the  Respondent  may  proceed
             (paragraph 15) instead of determining only 1 of the grounds of
             appeal in 1 sentence."

 6. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision records that during the period
    of the appellant's last  grant  of  leave  to  remain  he  had  visited
    Pakistan and on his return to the United Kingdom was  detained  by  the
    authorities and held for  fourteen  days  on  suspicion  of  committing
    offences.  He was not charged with any offences and  his  passport  was
    returned to him on 3 February 2014.  Upon receipt he sent it along with
    his application for further leave to remain to the respondent.

 7. The appellant claimed that he had taken an English test (a TOEIC  test)
    at West Bridge College.  At the end of March the BBC  exposed  a  fraud
    being conducted at the college in respect of the English language tests
    resulting in none of the test results released therefrom being  capable
    of use by students  such  as  the  appellant  who  wished  to  make  an
    application for leave to remain.

 8. The appellant appreciated that he  had  to  obtain  a  Confirmation  of
    Acceptance for Studies  (CAS)  form  but  was  unable  to  obtain  that
    documentation without producing evidence of having  passed  a  language
    test.  In order to take such a test he needed to produce  his  passport
    which  had  been  sent  by  him  to  the  respondent  along  with   his
    application.  As a result of this predicament he  wrote  twice  to  the
    respondent explaining the  situation  and  requesting  a  return  of  a
    certified copy of his passport which would then enable him to take  the
    appropriate test and subsequently obtain a CAS form.   He  received  no
    replies to those letters.

 9. In an attempt to speed matters up the appellant booked an IELTS test to
    be sat on 21 June 2014.  Again though he was unable to take  the  test
    that day due to the absence  of  a  certified  copy  of  his  passport.
    Without  a  test  certificate  the  appellant  could  not  support  his
    application for his CAS.

10. The judge's decision can be gleaned from paragraphs 14, 15  and  16  of
    his decision.  He finds at paragraph 14 that:

        "14. ... It  is  apparent  that  he  has  submitted  an  incomplete
             application and that as at the date of the decision he had  not
             provided a CAS form."

    Paragraphs 15 and 16 state:

         "15. In view of these particular circumstances however,  where  his
             passport was only returned to him on 3rd  February;  with  his
             leave expiring on 31st March; with him forwarding his passport
             to the Respondent on 28th March; with the  Respondent  failing
             to provide a certified copy so as to enable the  Appellant  to
             take a further  English  test,  the  Respondent  may  wish  to
             consider the decision  which  has  been  made  and  grant  the
             Appellant a short period of leave together  with  a  certified
             copy of the passport so as to enable the Appellant  to  pursue
             an English language test and endeavour to obtain a CAS form.

         16.  This suggestion is made bearing in mind  the  period  of  time
             that the Appellant has been studying in this country and  from
             the oral evidence given that approximately ï¿½20,000 to date has
             been spent by a family relative on his education."

    The judge then dismissed the appellant's appeal under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

11. Today Mr Haque handed up at the outset a chronology, a response to  the
    Rule 24 response by the respondent, two Home Office documents  relating
    to changes to  English  language  certification  requirements  and  the
    authority of Patel (Revocation of sponsor  licence  -  fairness)  India
    [2011] UKUT 00211 (IAC).

12. He, relying on the above-mentioned authority, asserted that Immigration
    Judges have jurisdiction to determine whether decisions on variation of
    leave applications are in accordance with  the  law,  where  issues  of
    fairness arise.  On the facts  of  this  particular  appeal  the  judge
    should have allowed it on the  basis  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law and that he erred in failing to appreciate that
    the  fairness  of  the  decision  was  both  something  that  could  be
    adjudicated upon and also that the Tribunal had power to rule  upon  in
    all the circumstances.  This was an appellant who had taken two English
    tests and passed.  However, as the last test was a  TOEIC  one  and  an
    investigation had found some fraud regarding the test the test  was  no
    longer being accepted.  Although  there  was  no  suggestion  that  the
    appellant had himself acted fraudulently the end result was that he had
    had to take another English to get his  CAS.   The  respondent  ignored
    repeated requests that were made for the return of a certified copy  of
    his passport.  Further, beyond the fact  that  the  appellant  was  not
    treated fairly it was in any event an infringement  of  his  Article  8
    rights by reason of his established  private  life  within  the  United
    Kingdom.

13. Mr Avery argued that  the  appellant  had  available  to  him  his  own
    passport from 3 February to 28 March with every opportunity to  obtain
    during that period a certified copy.  It was for him to ensure that  he
    could meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.   In  any  event
    there is an issue as to whether or not the  appellant  took  the  TOEIC
    test and that he may not have told the truth.

14. The appellant's difficulties were of his own  making  and  not  of  the
    Secretary of State.  There is in all the  circumstances  no  unfairness
    and no breach of the appellant's Article 8 rights.

15. I deal firstly with the Article 8 point.  Albeit that the judge has not
    made reference to Article 8 this is not a  material  error  as  on  the
    facts of this particular appeal the appellant would not have  succeeded
    under Article 8 in any event.

16. The Supreme Court in Patel & Others v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2013] UKSC 72 has now effectively held  that  there  is  no
    near-miss as such, albeit that all facts have to be taken into  account
    and considered in context.  In that case three of  the  appellants  who
    could not  rely  on  points-based  evidence  on  an  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules because of Section 85A Exception 2 of  the  2002  Act
    sought to rely on it under Article 8.  The argument was that, if it  is
    shown that the appellant could have met the substantive requirements of
    the Rules, the failure to do so should be regarded  as  purely  formal,
    and that  accordingly,  in  the  proportionality  balance  required  by
    Article  8,  the  objectives  of  immigration  control   should   carry
    relatively less weight.  A variant of this argument referred to as  the
    "near-miss" principle is  that  the  degree  of  failure  to  meet  the
    requirements of the  Rules  may  be  relevant  in  the  proportionality
    balance.  In the Supreme Court, Carnwath LJ said:

         "Although  the  context  of  the  rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
         consideration of proportionality, I agree with Burnton LJ [in  Miah
         v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA  Civ  261;
         [2013] QB 35] that this cannot be equated with a formalised  'near-
         miss' or 'sliding scale' principle..."

    Referring to Huang it was said that:

         "Mrs Huang's case for favourable treatment outside  the  rules  did
         not turn on how close she had come to compliance with rule 317, but
         on the application of the family values which  underlie  that  rule
         and are at the heart also of article 8.   Conversely,  a  near-miss
         under the rules cannot provide substance to  a  human  rights  case
         which is otherwise lacking in merit."

    Carnwath LJ went on to say:

         "One may sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in  Pankina  for  'common
         sense' in the application of the rules to graduates who  have  been
         studying in the UK for some years.  However, such considerations do
         not by themselves provide grounds of appeal under article 8,  which
         is concerned with private or family life, not  education  as  such.
         The opportunity for a promising student to complete his  course  in
         this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in  itself
         a right protected under article 8."

17. However, following Patel & Others v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] UKSC 72, the prospect of  a  student  now  succeeding
    under Article 8 where he or she cannot meet the  Immigration  Rules  is
    remote.  Paragraphs 56 and 57 of that judgment state:

         "56. Although the context of the  rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
             consideration of proportionality, I agree with Burnton LJ that
             this cannot  be  equated  with  a  formalised  'near-miss'  or
             'sliding scale' principle, as argued for by  Mr Malik.   That
             approach is unsupported  by  Strasbourg  authority,  or  by  a
             proper reading of Lord Bingham's words.  Mrs Huang's case  for
             favourable treatment outside the rules did  not  turn  on  how
             close she had come to compliance with rule  317,  but  on  the
             application of the family values which underlie that rule  and
             are at the heart also of article 8.  Conversely,  a  near-miss
             under the rules cannot provide substance  to  a  human  rights
             case which is otherwise lacking in merit.

         57.  It is important to remember that article 8 is  not  a  general
             dispensing  power.   It  is  to  be  distinguished  from   the
             Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
             outside the rules, which may be  unrelated  to  any  protected
             human right.  The merits of a decision not to depart from  the
             rules are not reviewable on appeal: section  86(6).   One  may
             sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for 'common sense'
             in the application of the rules to  graduates  who  have  been
             studying in the  UK  for  some  years  (see  para  47  above).
             However, such considerations  do  not  by  themselves  provide
             grounds of appeal under article 8,  which  is  concerned  with
             private  or  family  life,  not  education   as   such.    The
             opportunity for a promising student to complete his course  in
             this country, however desirable in general terms,  is  not  in
             itself a right protected under article 8."

18. Mr Haque's submission is that having taken account of paragraph  16  of
    his decision the period of time the appellant has spent in  the  United
    Kingdom and the cost of his education the judge should have found  that
    the respondent's decision would be disproportionate.

19. As I say, whilst the judge may have overlooked the Article 8 claim,  it
    is not a material error as there was  no  prospect  of  this  appellant
    succeeding under Article 8 where he was unable to meet the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules themselves and on the individual facts of  his
    case as found by the judge.

20. As to Mr Haque's other submission again I reject it.  The judge has not
    erred in his approach.  It was inevitable that he would find  that  the
    appellant could not meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  by
    reason of having submitted an incomplete application and that as at the
    date of the decision he had not provided a CAS form.  The judge did not
    err in "not appreciating that the fairness of the  decision,  was  both
    something that could be adjudicated on and also that the  Tribunal  had
    power to rule upon".  Prior to sending his passport to  the  respondent
    the appellant had ample opportunity to obtain certified copies  thereof
    for use in any future application for an English test.  The decision to
    refuse the application was a lawful one.  The nub of  the  position  is
    that  the  appellant  was  unable  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules  and  the  judge  did  not  err  in  so  finding  and
    dismissing his appeal.

21. The conclusions of the First-tier Tribunal Judge were open to  be  made
    in all the circumstances.

22. The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law and I do not set aside the decision but  order  that  it
    shall stand.

23. No anonymity direction is made.
