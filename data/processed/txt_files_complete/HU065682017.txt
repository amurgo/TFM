For the Appellant:     Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Berry, counsel, instructed by MT UK Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as the Secretary of State  and  to  the
      respondent as the claimant.

   2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision of
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge, promulgated on 4  July  2018,  allowing
      the claimant's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's  decision  to
      refuse his application for leave to remain in the UK.

   3. In granting  permission,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Sutherland
      Williams stated that although the Judge had correctly applied the  law
      and made sufficient findings of fact, he had concerns in  relation  to
      her finding that the claimant had previously met the  requirements  of
      the Immigration Rules. That had a significant impact  on  the  Judge's
      finding in terms of proportionality.

The background to the appeal

   4. The Judge set out the claimant's immigration history. He is a national
      of Sri Lanka, born on 17 December 1991. His father arrived in  the  UK
      in 2002. The claimant asserted that he entered the UK aged 11 with his
      mother and two sisters.

   5. He started to make applications for further leave to remain from 2010.
      His most recent application, submitted on 12 August 2016  was  refused
      without a right of appeal. That decision was then withdrawn and remade
      on 17 May 2017 with an in-country right of appeal [4].

   6. The Secretary of State refused the application under paragraph  276ADE
      of the Immigration Rules as the claimant did not meet the  eligibility
      requirements under S-LTR1.6 of Appendix FM, because  of  his  criminal
      conviction. This led the Secretary  of  State  to  conclude  that  his
      conduct, character, associations or other reasons made it  undesirable
      for him to remain in the UK [5]. The claimant had  been  convicted  of
      possessing/control  of  an  identity  document   with   intent.   That
      conviction took effect on 16 July 2014 - [5].

   7. The Secretary of State was moreover not satisfied that he  would  face
      very significant obstacles to hid integration in Sri Lanka because  he
      had lived there for 11 years. He would be returning with  his  parents
      and would have extended family and friends there who would assist  him
      with settling in.

   8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge was not satisfied that his one  offence,
      or his conduct generally, led her to conclude that  he  was  a  person
      whom it is undesirable to allow to remain in the UK [14].

   9. She found that although the claimant will face initial  challenges  on
      return to  Sri  Lanka,  these  did  not  amount  to  very  significant
      obstacles to integration.

  10. With respect to  his  claim  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
      Convention, she found that it was not disputed that the  claimant  has
      established family life in the UK, most importantly with  his  fiancï¿½e
      who is British,  although  she  stated  that  in  her  proportionality
      assessment, she can  place  little  weight  on  this  relationship  in
      accordance with s.117B(iv) of the 2002 Act. She found that  the  first
      four Razgar questions can be answered positively [24].

  11. On the issue of proportionality, she acknowledged  that  the  claimant
      has lived unlawfully in the UK for many years. However, he should  not
      be blamed for his parents' actions and the  evidence  before  her  was
      that from the age of 19, when he became aware of his lack  of  status,
      he has sought to resolve this.  His  conviction  did  not  render  his
      presence in the UK undesirable. He has established a life  in  the  UK
      which is self-sufficient, and he has a prospect of a good career if he
      is able to return to university to complete his studies [25].

  12. She stated that what  weighed  significantly  in  his  favour  in  the
      assessment of  proportionality  is  the  fact  that  he  has  met  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules (albeit prior to the date of the
      appeal hearing).  The  public  interest  in  those  circumstances  was
      significantly  diminished.   Accordingly,   his   removal   would   be
      disproportionate.

  13. In his submissions before the Upper Tribunal, Mr Lindsay  adopted  the
      Secretary of State's grounds. He referred to LT (Kosovo) v SSHD [2016]
      EWCA Civ 1246, where the Court of Appeal held that '... the  Secretary
      of State is the primary  decision  maker.  She  has  a  constitutional
      responsibility to make  judgments  as  to  the  force  of  the  public
      interest in deportation cases. That circumstance has  to  be  balanced
      against the appellant's right to a merits appeal. In such a case,  the
      Tribunal has to consider all the facts put before them and  to  accord
      significant weight to the Secretary of State's  view'.  Although  that
      appeal related to a deportation  context,  the  decision  informs  the
      approach to be adopted in this case.

  14. Mr Lindsay submitted that this is particularly so having regard to the
      Judge's findings at [25]. It is not clear what the Judge was referring
      to at  [26]  when  she  stated  that  weighing  significantly  in  the
      claimant's favour in her assessment of proportionality,  is  the  fact
      that he has met the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  albeit
      prior to the date of the appeal hearing. He submitted that  the  Rules
      had not in fact been met.

  15. He submitted that the no weight was given to the Secretary of  State's
      view relating to suitability,  a  substantial  requirement  under  the
      Rules. The Judge had to have regard to all the  relevant  requirements
      of the Rules as part of the assessment. The claimant's conviction pre-
      dated his claim.

  16. In reply, Mr Berry referred to the claimant's  Rule  24  response.  He
      submitted that while different Tribunals may  assess  the  balance  in
      different ways and reach different results in doing so,  the  approach
      by the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not contain any material error of
      law.

  17. She found as part of the assessment  regarding  proportionality  under
      Article 8, that the claimant would have satisfied  the  Rules,  namely
      that he was under 25 and had spent half his life in the  UK,  when  an
      earlier application was made and that, having been brought to  the  UK
      by his parents aged 11, this was  a  factor  of  significance  in  the
      assessment of  proportionality  even  though  he  no  longer  met  the
      requirements of the Rules. He now had to show  that  there  were  very
      significant obstacles to return as he was over 25  years  old  at  the
      time he secured an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

  18. He submitted that although it is correct that the Tribunal focused  on
      an earlier "application" said to be made when the claimant was  24  in
      August 2016 [15], these were  in  fact  "fresh  representations".  The
      litigation history thereafter showed that while under 25 he  had  made
      representations as part of a fresh human rights application which  led
      ultimately and belatedly to the concession of  a  fresh  claim  and  a
      right of appeal.

  19. He accordingly submitted that the Tribunal's decision was not wrong in
      substance. Further, in the assessment of proportionality for Article 8
      purposes, it is not unlawful to consider  the  degree  of  integration
      that a young person brought to the UK as  a  child  has  had,  and  to
      reflect that had earlier representations been treated as a fresh claim
      as they should have been, he  would  have  satisfied  the  substantive
      criteria for those under 25 years old.

  20. He also submitted that the suitability provisions are  concerned  with
      character, conduct and associations. The judicial task is  accordingly
      evaluative and is not concerned with identifying rigid Rules so as  to
      fall in or outside its scope.

  21. The Judge properly took into account the present remorse. He  referred
      to the suitability provisions at S-LTR.1.6.

      Assessment

  22. The First-tier Tribunal Judge at [15-17] and [22-26]  found  that  had
      the Secretary of State granted a right of appeal in  the  August  2016
      application,  the  claimant  would  have  succeeded  under   paragraph
      276ADE(v).  She  gave  significant  weight  to  that  "fact"  in   the
      assessment of proportionality.

  23. However, as contended in the Secretary of State's grounds, the history
      of his applications  show  that  the  claimant  became  appeal  rights
      exhausted in April 2016.  The  Secretary  of  State  rejected  further
      submissions in October and December 2016. It was only as a  result  of
      judicial review proceedings that the Secretary of  State  made  a  new
      decision granting a right of appeal. As the claimant was appeal rights
      exhausted in April 2016, he was not entitled to a right of appeal  and
      he would not have been able to succeed under paragraph 276DE(v) of the
      Rules. The Judge found that the appellant had met the requirements  of
      the Rules, albeit prior to the date of the appeal hearing.

  24. Further,  no  evidence  was  produced  to  show  that  the  claimant's
      conviction was in any way incorrect. Moreover, the fact that he may be
      sorry for his actions did not show him to have "rebutted" the decision
      on suitability.

  25. The Judge found that the claimant  would  not  face  very  significant
      obstacles to re-integration in Sri Lanka.

  26. She did not explain  why  the  suitability  findings  with  regard  to
      paragraph 276ADE were not relevant and germane to the  proportionality
      of the assessment under Article 8. She has  not  undertaken  a  proper
      assessment or given reasons as to  why  she  paid  no  regard  to  the
      Secretary of State's assertion that his conduct  made  it  undesirable
      for him to remain in the UK. The facts behind his conviction were  not
      shown to be wrong. As contended by  Mr  Lindsay,  the  fact  that  the
      claimant may have been sorry for his actions was not a  factor  to  be
      used by the Judge to rebut the decision on suitability.

  27. In the circumstances I  find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal involved the making  of  an  error  on  a  point  of  law.  I
      accordingly set it aside. The parties agreed that  in  that  event,  a
      fresh decision would have to be made.

  28. I have  had  regard  to  the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement
      regarding the remitting of appeals to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
      fresh decision. I am  satisfied  that  the  extent  of  judicial  fact
      finding which is necessary in order for the  decision  to  be  re-made
      will be extensive.  There  will  be  a  complete  re-hearing  with  no
      findings preserved.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error on a point of law. It is set aside. The appeal  is  remitted  to
      the First-tier Tribunal (Hatton Cross) for a fresh decision to be made
      by another Judge.
