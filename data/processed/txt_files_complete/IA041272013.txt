                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   On 24th July 2012 an application was lodged on behalf  of  Mr  Chaudhry
    for a permanent residence card, for which he was said to qualify  under
    regulations 10 and 15 of the EEA Regulations 2006.  The application was
    refused, and an appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal on 28th June
    2013.  Judge Rastogi dismissed the appeal for two reasons.  She was not
    satisfied that Mr Chaudhry's former wife, Liliana Neves, was exercising
    'Treaty rights' on the date when their marriage  was  terminated  by  a
    decree absolute : 2nd July 2012.  This was because  the  only  evidence
    before her that this was so comprised a report by an accountancy  firm,
    A.T.A. Khan & Co., supposedly showing Mrs Neves' income and expenditure
    for the period 6th April to 2nd July 2012, yielding a  net  profit  for
    tax purposes of ï¿½1,845.  This document, thought the judge, was  not  to
    be relied on.  The other reason was one that had not  featured  in  the
    Reasons for Refusal Letter,  but  was  flagged  up  by  the  Presenting
    Officer at the hearing, namely that, counting from  the  date  when  Mr
    Chaudhry married Liliana Neves and became the 'family member' of an EEA
    national ~ 15th July 2008 ~ the appellant needed to have resided for  a
    continuous period of five years in  accordance  with  the  Regulations,
    before he could qualify for a right of permanent residence.  The  five-
    year point had not yet been reached.  Judge Rastogi did  not  accept  a
    submission that the appellant could be regarded as the dependant of  an
    EEA national before the wedding.

2.    Permission to appeal was only sought in respect of the first of  those
    reasons (as well as on Article 8 grounds, which Mr Ahmed very  sensibly
    did not pursue).  When the matter came before me today, I  pointed  out
    that the second reason had not  been  challenged.   Mr  Ahmed  observed
    that, by the time the First-tier determination was promulgated on  16th
    July this year, the five-year point had been  passed.   Indeed,  if  he
    satisfied the other requirements  of  the  Regulations,  the  appellant
    would now have acquired a right of permanent residence in the UK.   But
    was it an error of law for Judge Rastogi to find that he  had  not  yet
    passed the five-year mark when she heard the appeal on 28th  June,  and
    when she signed  off  her  determination  on  13th  July?   Mr  Ahmed's
    contention, that the appeal should have been allowed on the basis that,
    by the time the determination  was  promulgated,  the  five  years  had
    elapsed, falls to be rejected,  I  think,  for  reasons  of  principle.
    Although in the present case the  determination  was  signed  off  just
    before the five-year period was due to expire, the might be other cases
    where the end point was further off, and yet a  delay  in  promulgating
    the determination would cause the end point to have been reached before
    promulgation.  That would not, in my view, make the determination wrong
    in law.

3.   In any event, I do not think the judge erred in law by  dismissing  the
    appeal for the other reason she gave.  It turns out  that  the  figures
    for income and expenditure in the accountants' report  for  the  period
    6th April to 2nd July 2012  were  there  all  along,  but  somehow  got
    covered over when the report was photocopied.  But no one drew that  to
    Judge Rastogi's attention when she saw that the right-hand side of  the
    page was blank.  In cross-examination the appellant was asked why there
    were no figures for income  and  expenditure  in  the  report,  and  he
    replied that he did not know.   He  was  not  an  accountant.   In  her
    closing submissions, the Presenting Officer relied on the  omission  of
    these figures from the calculation as casting doubt  on  the  accounts.
    Counsel for the appellant, in her response, did not attempt to  explain
    the omission, save to observe that the period in  question  was  not  a
    full year, whereas the reports for the financial years  ending  on  5th
    April 2010, 2011 and 2012 did have all the necessary figures for income
    and expenditure.

4.   In other words, nobody at the hearing ~  not  the  appellant,  not  his
    counsel, not the Presenting Officer, and not the judge ~ had  any  idea
    that the income and expenditure page of  the  report  had  been  partly
    blanked out.  It was suggested today that the appellant handed  a  full
    copy of the report to the Presenting Officer, but that cannot be right.
      It  is  inconsistent  with  his  answer  in  cross-examination.   The
    solicitors attached a full copy  of  the  accountants'  report  to  the
    application for leave to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and  today  Mr
    Ahmed tried to persuade me that it should  have  been  obvious  to  the
    judge that the figures had been accidentally blanked out,  rather  than
    being deliberately omitted.  But since neither the  appellant  nor  his
    counsel could suggest a reason why the figures did not  appear  on  the
    sheet, it cannot be an error of law that the judge failed to  work  out
    for herself that it must be an accident.

5.   That was not the only thing that struck then judge  as  odd  about  the
    report.  There was no mention of the accounts for 6th April to 2nd July
    in the letter from the accountants to Ms Neves dated  16th  July  2012,
    referring to the financial year ending on 5th April 2012.  All in  all,
    the judge was not satisfied that "the accounts are  reliable  documents
    to which I can properly attach weight."  That  finding  was  rationally
    open to her on the evidence, and was not therefore erroneous in law.

6.   Mr Bramble sensibly suggested that the  best  course  for  Mr  Chaudhry
    would be to make a fresh application.  The  appellant  had  produced  a
    recent letter from HM Revenue  &  Customs  to  Ms  Neves'  accountants,
    indicating that she was in business during  the  financial  year  2012-
    2013.  This letter could not be considered at the 'error of law' stage,
    but could be adduced as part of a  fresh  application.   The  appellant
    says that the letter was given to him by his ex-wife, and that she also
    agreed to the accountants preparing a report for the period  ending  at
    the date of her divorce ~ obviously, not something needed by Revenue  &
    Customs.  There is no confirmation of this from Liliana Neves  herself,
    another omission which it  might  be  as  well  for  the  appellant  to
    rectify.






     DECISION

     The appeal is dismissed.
