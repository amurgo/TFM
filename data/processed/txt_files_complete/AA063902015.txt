For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq born on the 20th January  1985.  He
    appeals with permission[1] the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Heynes) to dismiss his appeal against the Respondent's  decision
    to refuse to vary his leave to remain and to remove him from the United
    Kingdom pursuant to s47 of the Immigration Asylum and  Nationality  Act
    2006.

 2. The Appellant had previously had Discretionary Leave to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom so that he could  act  as  the  primary  carer  for  his
    brother, who suffers from serious mental illness.  On the 21st May 2014
    he made an application to vary that leave  so  as  to  extend  it.   He
    relied on the relationship with his brother, but also his  relationship
    with Polish national Ms Patricia Barbara Korkec.

 3. The  Respondent  refused  that  application,  inter  alia  because  the
    Appellant was no longer the primary carer for his brother, his  brother
    having been convicted of a criminal offence and sent to prison.  As  to
    the relationship with Ms Korkec, the Respondent was not satisfied  that
    this was a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship,  nor  that  she  was
    'settled' in the United Kingdom. It  was  not  accepted  that  she  had
    acquired a right of permanent residence having resided  in  the  UK  in
    accordance with the Regulations[2] for a period of five years or  more.
    Even if her status could be  established  as  settled,  the  Respondent
    reasoned, the Appellant had  not  demonstrated  that  the  relationship
    could not continue elsewhere. There was therefore no interference  with
    any family life that might exist.

 4. When the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal both the  Appellant
    and Ms Korkec gave  oral  evidence.  Having  heard  that  evidence  the
    Respondent's representative, the HOPO Mr N. Richardson,  accepted  that
    this is a genuine and subsisting relationship and that Ms Korkec is  in
    fact the Appellant's partner.  The First-tier Tribunal appeared to have
    accepted this concession was well made: see paragraph 18. The matter in
    issue thereafter was framed, at paragraph 10 of the  determination,  as
    whether Ms Korkec had acquired a permanent  right  of  residence  under
    Regulation 15.

 5. In respect of that issue  the  First-tier  Tribunal  properly  directed
    itself to the matter of continuity of residence, noting at paragraph 12
    of the determination that continuity is not broken by absences of up to
    12 months "for an important reason including study". The Tribunal  then
    records that Ms Korkec was absent from the United Kingdom for more than
    6 months in 2010/11 and that "there is no evidence that  she  undertook
    study in the sense of completing a course of study" during that  break:
    "there is no evidence as to how  the  EEA  national  passed  the  seven
    months of her absence or to what extent, if at all, the absence can  be
    attributed to an important reason in the context of  the  Regulations".
    The Tribunal therefore concluded that Ms  Korkec  had  not  acquired  a
    permanent  right  of  residence,  nor  had  the  Appellant,   and   the
    Regulations were of "no assistance" to his case. Turning to  Article  8
    the Tribunal noted that the Appellant's leave was  precarious  when  he
    embarked on the relationship with Ms Korkec, and that he did not have a
    choice about where his family life could  be  conducted.  Whilst  "some
    degree of hardship would ensue" in them both returning  to  Iraq  there
    was nothing to prevent them both going to live there.

 6. The Appellant now has permission to appeal on the ground that the First-
    tier  Tribunal  misdirected  itself  to   the   applicable   law,   the
    determination contains errors of  fact  and  there  was  a  failure  to
    consider material evidence.

 7. In her Rule 24 response of the 29th October 2015 the Respondent opposed
    the appeal on all grounds  but  before  me  Mr  Harrison  took  a  more
    realistic view, accepting that there was material  evidence  which  did
    not appear to have been considered by  the  Tribunal,  namely  that  Ms
    Korkec had returned to Poland in 2010/11 in order  to  take  her  final
    nursing exams, and that she had been employed ever since, latterly as a
    nurse in the NHS, having now specialised in neurosurgery.

    Error of Law

     'EEA' Grounds

 8. The Tribunal, and indeed the Respondent, accepted that a) Ms Korkec  is
    an EEA national currently exercising treaty  rights  and  b)  that  the
    Appellant is in a durable relationship with her.  Those facts as  found
    should have led to a declaration that the  Appellant  is  an  'extended
    family member' under Regulation 8. The  appeal  should  therefore  have
    been allowed  to  the  extent  that  the  matter  is  remitted  to  the
    Respondent in order that she exercise her discretion  under  Regulation
    17(4).   There is no indication that the Tribunal considered this.  The
    Appellant had clearly raised EEA grounds in both  his  application  and
    his grounds of appeal and the failure to address this  matter  was  the
    first error of law.

 9. For the avoidance of doubt there was good documentary  evidence  of  Ms
    Korkec's consistent, and current, employment, in the form of  payslips,
    correspondence from her employers, her own credible  evidence  and  the
    statement from HMRC showing that she has been  economically  active  in
    the UK for the last five years, and that she earned well  over  ï¿½25,000
    in the year preceding the appeal hearing.  She is employed full time by
    the NHS as a specialist nurse in  neurosurgery,  and  works  additional
    hours as a bank nurse.  The HOPO on the day conceded  that  this  is  a
    genuine relationship.  I  therefore  find  that  the  Appellant  is  an
    extended family member under Regulation 8 and  that  the  Secretary  of
    State must now consider issuing him with a residence card.

10. It was perhaps because  this  was  first  and  foremost  an  Article  8
    application and appeal that the Tribunal appears  to  have  exclusively
    focussed its attention  on  the  question  of  whether  Ms  Korkec  was
    'settled' in the UK by virtue of having acquired a permanent  right  of
    residence under the Regulations. I am satisfied that  in  reaching  its
    findings on this matter the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in failing
    to take material evidence into account, and in making an error of fact.
    She was not absent from the United Kingdom for seven months.  She  left
    in October 2010 and returned in February 2011, a period of just over  4
    months. The determination suggests that the  Tribunal  considered  that
    the reason for this absence could not be "good" unless Ms Korkec  could
    demonstrate that she was undertaking a  course  of  study.  That  is  a
    misdirection. She just needed to show good  reason.  The  evidence  was
    that she returned to Poland to take her final nursing exams. That is  a
    perfectly good reason. Having had regard to  the  HMRC  statement,  the
    wage slips and her statement dated 24th June 2015 I am  satisfied  that
    she has resided in the UK for a continuous  period  of  five  years  in
    accordance with these Regulations and that she has therefore acquired a
    right of permanent residence.

11. Mr Hussain submitted that the Appellant could, in these  circumstances,
    derive his own permanent right of residence under Regulation 15(1)(b):

         '15.-(1) The following persons shall acquire the right to reside in
         the United Kingdom permanently -

         (a)      an EEA national who has resided in the United  Kingdom  in
         accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period  of  five
         years;

         (b)      a family member of an EEA national who is not  himself  an
         EEA national but who has resided in the United Kingdom with the EEA
         national in accordance with  these  Regulations  for  a  continuous
         period of five years;

         ...'

12. In recognition of the fact that as an unmarried partner  the  Appellant
    is not a 'family member' for the purpose of Regulation  7,  Mr  Hussain
    took me to Regulation 7(3):

         '(3)     Subject to paragraph (4), a  person  who  is  an  extended
         family member and has been issued with  an  EEA  family  permit,  a
         registration certificate or a residence card shall  be  treated  as
         the family member of the relevant EEA national for as  long  as  he
         continues to satisfy the conditions in regulation 8(2), (3), (4) or
         (5) in relation to that EEA national and the permit, certificate or
         card has not ceased to be valid or been revoked.'

13. The Appellant has not, at this stage, been issued with a family permit.
    No EEA application has ever been made, and in fact Ms Korkec  confirmed
    that she has never sought written confirmation of her right  to  reside
    in the UK.   I  am  not  satisfied  that  in  these  circumstances  the
    Appellant is a 'family member' for the purposes of Regulation 15(1)(b).
    The  Respondent  is  therefore  under  no  obligation  to   grant   him
    confirmation of a right of permanent residence under the Regulations.

    Article 8

14. Returning to the Article 8 grounds I find that the First-tier  Tribunal
    did err in law in its assessment that there was  "nothing  to  prevent"
    this couple returning to Iraq. That  conclusion  was  reached  with  no
    regard to FCO travel advice that had been submitted on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant, which indicated inter alia that there  is  a  high  risk  of
    terrorism including kidnapping in Iraq. That travel advice accords with
    current country guidance on Iraq:  AA (Article 15(c))  CG  [2015]  UKUT
    544 (IAC).  I therefore set the decision on Article 8 aside.

15. Given my indication on the EEA grounds, Mr Hussain did not  pursue  the
    Article 8 grounds on remaking. In declining to make submissions on this
    matter  he  made  no  concessions  as  to  whether   there   might   be
    insurmountable obstacles to Ms  Korkec  re-settling  in  Iraq.  He  has
    therefore kept his powder dry.   No  doubt  the  Respondent  will  give
    anxious scrutiny  to  the  current  security  situation  in  Iraq  when
    considering her discretion under Regulation 17(4).

    Decisions

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains error of laws  and  it
    is set aside.

17. I re-make the decision as follows:

    "The Appellant's appeal is allowed with reference  to  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area Regulations 2006"

18. I was not asked to make an order for anonymity and in the circumstances
    I see no reason to do so.
