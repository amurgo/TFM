                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent



For the Appellant:     Mrs J Moore, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The appellant appeals against a determination by First-tier Tribunal
       Judge Callow, dismissing her appeal against  refusal  of  a  tier  4
       application under the Points Based System (PBS).


    2. The appeal was decided "on the papers" in the  First-tier  Tribunal.
       It failed because it  was  thought  that  the  appellant  needed  to
       provide a letter from her parents confirming their relationship  and
       their consent to use of funds.

    3.  The  Presenting  Officer  observed  that  this   stemmed   from   a
       misunderstanding of the legal requirements,  brought  about  by  the
       appellant  not  filling  in  correctly  parts  L22  -  L24  of   the
       application form.  In fact, she was a "low risk student" who was not
       required  to  produce  documentation  of  this   nature   with   her
       application.  He fairly and correctly said that the decision  should
       be reversed.


    4. The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
       appeal, as brought by the appellant to the First-tier  Tribunal,  is
       allowed.

    5. No order for anonymity has been requested or made.  No fee award has
       been requested or made.
