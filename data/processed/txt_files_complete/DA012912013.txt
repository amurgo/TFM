Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, HOPO
For the Respondent:    Ms B Asanovic, Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant (the Secretary of State) has been granted  permission  to
    appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Mayall  allowing  the
    respondent's appeal against the decision taken on 18 June 2013 to  make
    a deportation order by virtue of Section 32(5) of the  UK  Borders  Act
    2007.

2.   The decision to make the deportation order against the  respondent  was
    as a result of his conviction for one count of possession  with  intent
    to supply a controlled drug, class B  -  cannabis;  and  one  count  of
    possession of a controlled drug of class A with intent  to  supply  for
    which he was sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment  on  9
    October 2012 at Wood Green Crown Court.

3.   Records showed that between January 2002 and July 2009, the  respondent
    had  received  seven  convictions  for   fifteen   offences   including
    possession of  an  offensive  weapon,  numerous  driving  offences  and
    possession of class A and B drugs.

4.   The respondent, who claims to have entered the  UK  in  1986,  aged  4,
    along  with  his  mother  and  siblings,  made   an   application   for
    naturalisation as a British citizen on  10  February  2011,  which  was
    refused on 19 May 2011 due to his criminal convictions.

5.   I was told that there was another member of  the  panel,  Sir  Geoffrey
    James, whose name unfortunately did not  appear  on  the  determination
    although there is throughout the determination a reference to "we". The
    Tribunal heard evidence from the respondent, his mother, Rose Igbanibo,
    his sister,  Daisy  Igbanibo  and  fiancï¿½e,  Naomi  Wynter.   Following
    consideration of all the  evidence  and  the  relevant  case  law,  the
    Tribunal found as follows:

         "56. Overall we found the witnesses to be credible  witnesses.   We
             considered their evidence very carefully  and  the  manner  in
             which they gave their evidence.  None of them were  shaken  in
             cross-examination and they all gave their evidence in  a  calm
             confident manner.

         57.  Their evidence was supported by the documents.  In  particular
             we take great note of the photographs.  There can be no  doubt
             that the photographs show the appellant and  his  siblings  in
             school uniforms.  There can be no doubt that these  are  taken
             in  the  UK.   There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the   earliest
             photographs show the appellant and his siblings  in  a  school
             uniform which they are all wearing and in which he is aged  no
             more than about 5 or so.  We consider that  this  gives  great
             support to the claim by the witnesses  that  he  had  been  in
             school from the age of about 5 or so.

         58.  We take note of the registration  with  the  GP.   It  is  not
             suggested that the registration certificate is a forgery.   It
             is unfortunate that  the  original  passport  upon  which  the
             appellant entered the UK is not available.  We cannot be  sure
             why that is the case but its absence  does  not  cause  us  to
             doubt the credibility of the witnesses.

         59.  Thus we accept that the appellant has lived in  the  UK  since
             1986 or very shortly thereafter.  We accept that he has  lived
             here continuously.

         60.  We accept the evidence that he has no close family in  Nigeria
             with whom he has any relationship whatsoever.  We accept  that
             his mother may have siblings in Nigeria  but  she  is  not  in
             contact with them and  they  have  had  no  contact  with  the
             appellant since, presumably, he left Nigeria.  We accept  that
             he has never visited Nigeria since he was a very young  child.
             We accept that he regards himself as British even  though  his
             application for naturalisation was refused.  His siblings  are
             all British.  Since a very young age  he  has  known  no  life
             other than in the UK.

          61.   We  accept  that  his  mother  has  been  back  to   Nigeria
             infrequently and that her reason for doing so was to  see  her
             mother.  Unfortunately her  mother  passed  away  in  December
             2010.

         62.  In these circumstances  we  do  not  consider  that  it  could
             reasonably be said that this appellant has any ties in Nigeria
             within  the  meaning  of  the  Immigration  Rules.    In   the
             circumstances we consider that he does meet  the  requirements
             as set out in paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules.  It was
             conceded  on  behalf  of  the  respondent   that,   in   these
             circumstances, the appeal would have to be allowed.

         63.  We consider that  this  appeal  must  be  allowed  because  to
             remove him would be a disproportionate interference  with  his
             right to a private life pursuant to Article 8.   Thus  one  of
             the exceptions to the 2007 Act applies."

6.   The respondent was granted  permission  in  respect  of  grounds  which
    argued that the judge failed to consider whether the respondent had any
    cultural ties to Nigeria.  This was arguable as the judge  appeared  to
    deal only with family ties in his consideration of paragraph 339A of HC
    395.

7.   Mr Wilding submitted that the determination  was  very  brief,  it  was
    made in seven short paragraphs.  The judge found that the appellant had
    no family in Nigeria and therefore no ties to Nigeria.   This  was  the
    wrong approach.  He cited paragraph 1 to 3 of Ogundimu (Article 8 - new
    Rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 60 (IAC) where the Upper Tribunal held  that
    "the natural and ordinary meaning of  the  word  "ties"  imports,  they
    thought, a concept involving something  more  than  merely  remote  and
    abstract links to the country of proposed deportation or  removal.   It
    involves there being a continued connection to life  in  that  country;
    something that ties a claimant to his or her country  of  origin."   Mr
    Wilding also relied on paragraph 122 where the Tribunal said the use of
    the phrase "no ties (including social, cultural  or  family)  with  the
    country to which he would have to go to if required to leave the UK" is
    not exclusive to paragraph 339A of the Rules.  Mr Wilding  argued  that
    the Tribunal limited itself  solely  to  consideration  of  the  family
    circumstances in the UK.  The  grounds  took  the  point  made  in  the
    Reasons for Refusal Letter that English is one of the national official
    languages spoken in Nigeria.  This was a relevant  consideration  which
    the judge failed to take into account.  There was no assessment  as  to
    family  ties  socially  or  culturally  with  Nigeria.   There  was  no
    consideration as to whether there were insurmountable obstacles to  his
    partner joining him in Nigeria if he has a  genuine  relationship  with
    her.

8.   Mr Wilding drew an analogy with Balogun, a  judgment  of  the  European
    Court of Human Rights in 2012.  He submitted that this case is  helpful
    as it distinguishes between the offences committed as  a  juvenile  and
    offences committed as an adult while living in the UK and ties with his
    home country.  It is not enough to consider only  family  circumstances
    in the UK and consequently the judge erred in law.

9.    Ms  Asanovic  relied  on  her  skeleton  argument.   She  argued  that
    permission was obtained on erroneous grounds.  The  grounds  said  that
    the judge failed to consider that the  respondent's  mother  maintained
    her links to Nigeria by making frequent  visits.   She  said  this  was
    contrary to the finding at paragraph 61 which said his mother had  been
    back to Nigeria infrequently.  The second  error  said  the  respondent
    could speak a Nigerian language yet in his evidence he said he did not.
     She submitted that permission would not have been granted if these two
    facts had been accurately presented.

10.  Ms Asanovic argued that although the judge's  determination  was  brief
    the findings can be gleaned from the evidence of the four witnesses who
    were found credible by the judge.  Furthermore, the evidence  given  by
    the witnesses, and accepted by the judge, was similar  to  the  factual
    evidence in Ogundimu, such as the claimant had no close family ties  in
    Nigeria and his mother went back infrequently.  She relied on the  head
    notes in Ogundimu. They are

     "1. The expectation is that it will be an  exceptional  case  in  which
             permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal should  be  granted
             where the lodging of the application for  permission  is  more
             than 28 days out of time.  Where, in such a case, a  judge  is
             minded to  grant  permission,  the  preferable  course  is  to
             provide   an   opportunity   to   the   respondent   to   make
             representations.   This  might  be  achieved  by  listing  the
             permission application for oral hearing.

     2.  The introduction of the new Immigration Rules  (HC  194)  does  not
             affect the circumstance that when considering Article 8 of the
             Human  Rights  Convention  'for  a  settled  migrant  who  has
             lawfully spent all or the major part of his or  her  childhood
             and youth in [this] country very serious reasons are  required
             to justify expulsion.'  The principles derived from  Maslov  v
             Austria [2008] ECHR 546 are still be applied.

     3.  Paragraph 399(a)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  conflicts  with  the
             Secretary  of  State's  duties  under  Article  3  of  the  UN
             Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 and section  55  of
             the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009.   Little
             weight should be attached to this Rule when  consideration  is
             being given to the assessment of proportionality under Article
             8 of the Human Rights Convention.

     4.  The natural and ordinary meaning of the word  'ties'  in  paragraph
             399A of the Immigration  Rules  imports  a  concept  involving
             something more than merely remote or  abstract  links  to  the
             country of proposed deportation or removal.  It involves there
             being a connection to life in that country.  Consideration  of
             whether a person has 'no ties' to such a country must  involve
             a rounded assessment of all of the relevant circumstances  and
             is  not  to  be  limited  to  'social,  cultural  and  family'
             circumstances."

11.  Ms Asanovic also relied on paragraph 125 which says

         "Whilst each case turns on its own  facts,  circumstances  relevant
         to the assessment of whether a person has ties to  the  country  to
         which they would have to go if they  were  required  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom must include, but are not limited to: the length  of
         time a person has spent in the country to which they would have  to
         go if he were required to leave the United Kingdom,  the  age  that
         the person left that country, the exposure that person has  had  to
         the cultural norms of that country, whether that person speaks  the
         language of the country, the extent of the family and friends  that
         person has in the country to which he is being deported or  removed
         and the quality of the relationships that  person  has  with  those
         friends and family members."

12.  She submitted that the respondent's relationship with  his  partner  is
    not necessary or relevant to his ties in Nigeria.

13.  Ms Asanovic also submitted that the  seriousness  of  the  respondent's
    offending is not relevant to ties in Nigeria.  Balogun's  mother  lived
    in Nigeria and he had contact with his mother.   It  was  against  that
    background that the European Court held he could forge  a  relationship
    with his mother even though he had not lived  in  Nigeria  for  a  long
    time. In Balogun it was not accepted that the claimant had ties in  the
    UK or a genuine relationship with his girlfriend.  In reply Mr  Wilding
    said that Balogun was looking at the human rights of the claimant under
    Article 8 and not within the Immigration  Rules.   The  European  Court
    held that Balogun had ties that could be pursued in Nigeria.   In  this
    case there was no analysis of family members in Nigeria or  whether  he
    could pursue these relationships.

14.   I  accept  that  the  judge's  findings  were  made  in  seven   brief
    paragraphs.  However, the findings have to be set against the  evidence
    given by the four witnesses who were found credible  and  whose  entire
    evidence was accepted by the judge.   Whilst  the  judgment  gives  the
    appearance of an analysis of family ties in the UK, the judge did  find
    that the respondent had no close family in Nigeria with whom he has any
    relationship whatsoever.  His mother may have siblings in  Nigeria  but
    she is not in contact with them and they have not had any contact  with
    the claimant since he left Nigeria when he was  4  years  old.   It  is
    therefore difficult to see how in the circumstances it  can  be  argued
    that the  claimant  could  pursue  a  relationship  with  these  family
    members.  The findings in paragraph 60 are relevant.  They  imply  that
    the respondent has no ties with Nigeria and has not had such ties since
    he was 4 years old. I find that whilst Balogun  was  found  to  have  a
    mother in Nigeria and therefore could pursue a relationship  with  her,
    in view of the findings made by the judge, the respondent in this  case
    has no family relationships which he could  pursue.  Therefore  I  find
    that failure to analyse any links  he  could  have  with  relatives  in
    Nigeria was not material in light of the facts found by the judge.

15.  I  agree  with  Counsel's  argument  that  the  circumstances  of  this
    respondent are similar to the circumstances in  Ogundimu.   Whilst  the
    judge has not specifically referred to Ogundimu  I  find  that  he  has
    applied the assessment set out in paragraph 125.

16.  Indeed the grounds misrepresented two of the facts found by the  judge.
     These facts played a part in the grant of permission.  Had  the  judge
    who granted permission been aware that the facts had been misstated, it
    is reasonably likely that she would not have granted permission.

17.  I find no error of law in the judge's decision.  His decision  allowing
    the respondent's appeal shall stand.
