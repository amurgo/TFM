Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Duffy
For the Respondent:    In person

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Mr Kersys is a citizen of Lithuania born in 1975.  He appealed  against
    a decision of the Secretary of State made on 21 January 2014 to make  a
    deportation order by virtue of  Regulations  19(3)(b)  and  21  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 2. Mr Kersys had been convicted on 17 January 2013  at  Basildon  Combined
    Crown Court of three counts of making  false  representations  to  make
    gain for himself or another and causing loss  to  another  or  exposing
    another to risk.  He was sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment  on  each
    count to run concurrently with each other making a total of 30  months.
    There was no recommendation for deportation.

 3. He appealed against the Secretary of State's decision.

 4. Following a hearing at Taylor House on 8 August 2014 Judge of the First-
    tier  Mitchell allowed the appeal.

 5. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal which was granted by
    a judge on 4 September 2014.

 6. In proceedings before me the  Secretary  of  State  is  the  Appellant.
    However, for ease of understanding I will keep the designations as they
    were before the First-tier Tribunal, thus Mr Kersys  is  the  Appellant
    and the Secretary of State, the Respondent.

 7. Having set out the  applicable  law  the  Tribunal's  analysis  of  the
    evidence and his findings are at paragraphs 18 ff.

 8. In summary, he found that the Appellant had been in  the  UK  for  more
    than five years but less than ten years having arrived  in  the  UK  in
    April 2004 [20]; although he had pleaded not guilty he now accepted the
    conviction and has no intention of re-offending [21]; in prison he  was
    one of a small number of "trusted inmates" in the prison  wing  working
    in the kitchen and elsewhere [22]; he is at low  risk  of  re-offending
    [23]; since leaving prison he has been in work [24].

 9. He has four children in the UK  born  in  1999,  2001,  2002  and  2013
    respectively.  They had written letters in  support  [29];  he  has  no
    contact with any family members in Lithuania  and  has  not  been  back
    since arrival [36]; he owns property but  there  are  mortgage  arrears
    [29]; he is working to pay off his debts;  he  "obviously  feels  great
    embarrassment as a result of his imprisonment" [25].

10. The Tribunal found that the Appellant has "shown remorse"  and  has  an
    understanding  of his crime [35].

11. The Tribunal noted the Respondent's claim that the "conviction  is  one
    which may be regarded as serious and which  compels  the  Secretary  of
    State to give significant weight to the question of protecting  society
    against crime and disorder" [37].  It was accepted that  the  Appellant
    did not have  an  extensive  criminal  record  and  that  his  risk  of
    reconviction  and  of  harm  is  low  [37].   However,  the  Respondent
    considered it not reasonable to leave  the  public  vulnerable  to  the
    potential for him to re-offend.  It was considered that the  crime  the
    Appellant undertook was "sophisticated and not without having  victims"
    [37]. It had been an "identity-based fraud"[37].

12. However, going on to consider the jurisprudence  the  Tribunal,  noting
    the low risk of  re-offending  concluded  that  there  is  "nothing  to
    suggest that the Appellant's personal  conduct  represents  a  genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society" [39].  There is "no evidence that the
    Appellant does constitute a genuine and serious threat to public policy
    or that his past  conduct  alone  would  constitute  a  threat  to  the
    requirements of public policy or that he has  a  propensity  to  crime"
    [42].

13. The Tribunal next  noted  the  requirement  that  before  the  relevant
    decision is made a decision maker must take account  of  considerations
    such as age, state of health, family  and  economic  situation  of  the
    person, his length of residence, his social  and  cultural  integration
    and the extent of his links with his country of origin.

14. In that regard the Tribunal found that  the  Appellant's  three  oldest
    children have been in the UK for more than seven years; they have spent
    their formative years here; their best  interests  would  require  that
    their father be present; he has been providing for them financially; he
    has been economically active.  Also, he has "embraced living in the UK"
    and his family are "well integrated" here demonstrated by the fact that
    they speak English and  very  little  Lithuanian.   He  has  "extremely
    limited links with his country of origin" [44].

15. The Tribunal concluded by considering the Appellant's criminal  record.
    Although he had a drink  driving  conviction  he  was  treated  by  the
    sentencing judge as a man of  previous  good  character.   The  offence
    which had led to the current proceedings had involved the Appellant and
    his wife spending some  �112,000  of  a  deceased  elderly  neighbour's
    savings.  The crime was described by the sentencing judge  as  a  "mean
    spirited and nasty piece of offending".  The Tribunal  considered  that
    there was "no doubt that the crime would be viewed  by  the  public  as
    being despicable" [46].  The crimes  were  premeditated  and  committed
    over a period of months.  His wife was also convicted of the same crime
    but not imprisoned [48].

16. However, the Tribunal having noted the  requirement  of  Regulation  21
    concluded for the reasons given that it was "impossible to say that the
    Appellant represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat
    affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of   society".     The
    Respondent's letter and the Presenting Officer  could  not  make  clear
    what "fundamental interest of society the  Respondent  is  relying  on"
    [49].

17. At the error of law hearing before me Mr Duffy  sought  essentially  to
    rely on the grounds.

18. The grounds note that the Appellant was convicted of  three  counts  of
    dishonesty making false representations to make gain  for  self/another
    or cause loss to other/expose  other  to  risk.   Also,  it  noted  the
    sentencing remarks and the sentence and that  it  was  not  a  one  off
    occurrence and was  not  opportunistic  but  rather,  premeditated  and
    sophisticated. The Respondent concluded  that  this  was  an  extremely
    serious offence.

19. Whilst the risk of reconviction and of harm was assessed  as  low  such
    was not the only factor to consider.  The serious harm which  would  be
    caused by any similar instances of offending weighs heavily  in  favour
    of the public interest.

20. In addition, he had previously offended albeit for a "dissimilar matter
    some years ago".  Such, nonetheless, indicated that  he  had  not  been
    deterred by a previous conviction.  Such indicated a lack of regard for
    the law, a lack of remorse and an ongoing threat of criminal behaviour.

21. All in all the Tribunal failed properly to weigh the public interest in
    deporting the Appellant on serious grounds of public policy  or  public
    security.  The appropriate weight had not been applied in finding  that
    the Appellant does not pose a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
    threat.

22.  In  conclusion  "the  serious  nature  of  the  Appellant's  offending
    demonstrates that he clearly is a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat and ... the risk of future offending of a serious nature
    justifies the Appellant's deportation".

23. Mr Duffy referred me to two cases. First,  Tsakouridis  v  Land  Baden-
    Wurttemberg [2010] EUECJ C-145/09 at [60-62] where it was  stated  that
    Member States have an "area of discretion" within the limits imposed by
    the Treaty, to determine the requirements of public policy  and  public
    security. Second, Jarusevicius  (EEA  Reg  21-effect  of  imprisonment)
    [2012] UKUT 00120 (IAC) in particular the head note which includes  "6.
    Conspiracy to handle stolen  goods  is  different  from  the  kinds  of
    offences referred to in the UKBA Instructions note but the Tribunal was
    entitled to conclude that it amounted to  serious  grounds  within  the
    meaning of regulation 21(3)..."

24. The Appellant, in response, submitted a brief set of  written  comments
    in which he emphasised the judge's findings that he was at low risk  of
    re-offending.  He added that  the  judge's  reasoning  when  looked  at
    cumulatively was sound.  He stated further that the judge  had  clearly
    considered the seriousness of  the  offence  but  had  also  noted  the
    embarrassment of imprisonment on him and that he had shown remorse.

25. I reserved my decision.

26. In considering this matter I do not  find  merit  in  the  Respondent's
    submissions.

27. It was not disputed that the Appellant having been resident in  the  UK
    for more than five years, imprisonment notwithstanding,  has  permanent
    right of residence.

28. The Tribunal noted the circumstances of the offence.  In  essence  that
    the Appellant spent around �112,000 of a deceased  elderly  neighbour's
    savings.  The Tribunal also noted the sentencing remarks namely that it
    was "a mean spirited and nasty piece of offending".  Indeed  he  stated
    "there is no doubt that the crime would be  viewed  by  the  public  as
    despicable".

29. It is clear thus that the Tribunal acknowledged  the  severity  of  the
    Appellant's crime which was reflected  in  the  30  month  sentence  of
    imprisonment.

30. The Respondent has sought to emphasise that the  Appellant  was  not  a
    first time offender.  I see  no  merit  in  that  point,  the  Tribunal
    stating correctly that he was treated by the sentencing judge "as a man
    of previous good character".

31. I also do not find merit in the comment that  the  serious  harm  which
    would be caused by any similar instances of offending weighs heavily in
    favour of the public interest.  The Tribunal correctly noted  that  the
    National Probation Service Offender Manager had concluded the  risk  of
    reconviction and risk  of  serious  harm  as  low.   The  Tribunal  was
    entitled to accept that evidence.

32. The Tribunal also considered the  wider  situation  and  made  findings
    including that the Appellant' three older children have been in the  UK
    for more than seven years, are well  integrated  into  life  here,  and
    speak little Lithuanian and that it is in their best  interests  to  be
    with him. Also, that he has been economically active and  that  he  has
    very limited ties with Lithuania. These were  findings  which,  on  the
    evidence, the Tribunal was entitled to make.

33. The difficulty for the Respondent, in my judgment, is that in  relation
    to EU law, public interest has a very different meaning in that  it  is
    conditioned by the restrictions on exclusion and expulsion.  They  must
    be justified, as the Tribunal correctly noted,  on  grounds  of  public
    policy or  public  security.   These  "public  interest  provisos"  are
    interpreted restrictively by the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European
    Union.

34. I do not find the cases to which I was referred by Mr Duffy greatly  to
    assist  the  Respondent.  Each  case  depends  on  its  own  facts.  In
    Jarusevicius the sentence was  significantly  longer,  he  was  not  of
    previous good character and showed little or  no  remorse  or  wish  to
    reform. As for Tsakouridis whilst it is, indeed, appropriate for Member
    States to determine  the  requirements  of  public  policy  and  public
    security  in  light  of  their  national  needs,  how  such  policy  is
    administered in the context of EEA law is a separate matter.

35. In that regard the judge also noted  that  under  the  Regulations  the
    decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal  conduct  of  the
    person concerned; that the personal conduct  of  the  person  concerned
    must represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society;  that  matters
    isolated from the parties of the case or which relate to considerations
    of general prevention do not justify the decision; and that a  person's
    previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in  themselves  justify   the
    decision.

36. Public policy measures should only be taken if there  is  a  likelihood
    that the offender will commit further offences  or in  some  other  way
    infringe public security or policy. In every case the personal  conduct
    of the person involved, and in particular  the  indications  of  future
    risk or threats to public policy, must be assessed.

37. The Presidential Tribunal  in  Essa  (EEA:  rehabilitation/integration)
    [2013] UKUT 00316 (IAC) stated at [32]:

         "We observe that for any deportation of an EEA national ...  to  be
         justified on public good grounds (irrespective of whether permanent
         residence has been achieved) the claimant must represent a  present
         threat to public policy.  The fact of a criminal conviction is  not
         enough.  It is not permissible in an EEA case to deport a  claimant
         on the basis of criminal offending simply to  deter  others.   This
         tends to mean, in case  of  criminal  conduct  short  of  the  most
         serious threats to the public safety of the state, that a candidate
         for EEA deportation must represent a present threat by reason of  a
         propensity to  re-offend  or  an  unacceptably  high  risk  of  re-
         offending."

38. In this case the Appellant has  permanent  residence  thus  the  public
    policy criterion is the more stringent one, namely "serious grounds  of
    public policy".

39. The Tribunal considered the Appellant's relevant personal  conduct.  He
    went on to make findings that despite the nature and seriousness of the
    offences which resulted in the sentence of 30 months imprisonment,  the
    Appellant was effectively a first offender and that he was at low  risk
    of re-offending and of harm.  These were findings  which  were  clearly
    open to him on the evidence before him.

40. His conclusion from these findings that the Appellant's conduct did not
    represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting
    one of the fundamental interests of society, in other  words  that  the
    Appellant's  conduct  did  not  satisfy  the  stringent  public  policy
    criteria, was one he was entitled to reach  on  the  evidence  and  for
    which he gave adequate reasons.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shows no material error of  law  and
that decision allowing the appeal under the EEA Regulations shall stand.
