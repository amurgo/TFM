                                                                  Respondent


                                   Before

                  THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE MARTIN SPENCER
                               - - - - - - - -

Mr Gajjar,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  Allied  Law  Chambers  Solicitors,
appeared on behalf of the applicant.

Mr Malik,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  the  Government  Legal  Department,
appeared on behalf of the respondent.


     i) Where there has been a significant  difference  between  the  income
        claimed in a previous application for leave to remain and the income
        declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State  is  entitled  to  draw  an
        inference that the Applicant has been  deceitful  or  dishonest  and
        therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph  322(5)  of  the
        Immigration Rules.  Such an inference could be expected where  there
        is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy.


    ii) Where an Applicant has presented evidence to show that, despite  the
        prima facie inference,  he  was  not  in  fact  dishonest  but  only
        careless, then the  Secretary  of  State  must  decide  whether  the
        explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her view, to displace the
        prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.

   iii) In approaching that fact-finding task, the Secretary of State should
        remind herself that, although the standard of proof is the  "balance
        of probability", a finding that a  person  has  been  deceitful  and
        dishonest in relation to his tax affairs with the  consequence  that
        he is denied settlement in this country is a  very  serious  finding
        with serious consequences.

    iv) For an Applicant simply to  blame  his  or  her  accountant  for  an
        "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not be the end
        of the matter, given that the accountant will or should  have  asked
        the tax payer to confirm that the return was accurate  and  to  have
        signed the tax return. Furthermore the Applicant will have known  of
        his or her earnings and will have expected to pay tax  thereon.   If
        the Applicant does not take steps within a reasonable time to remedy
        the situation, the Secretary of State may be  entitled  to  conclude
        that this failure justifies a conclusion that there has been  deceit
        or dishonesty.

     v) When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest or merely
        careless the  Secretary  of  State  should  consider  the  following
        matters, inter alia, as  well  as  the  extent  to  which  they  are
        evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

         i. Whether the explanation for the  error  by  the  accountant  is
            plausible;
        ii. Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist  (for
            example,  correspondence  between   the   Applicant   and   his
            accountant at the time of the tax return) has been disclosed or
            there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;
       iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been  made
            because his liability to pay tax was less than he  should  have
            expected;
        iv. Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken steps to  remedy
            the situation and, if so, when those steps were taken  and  the
            explanation for any significant delay.



                       APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW
                              APPROVED JUDGMENT


MR JUSTICE MARTIN SPENCER:


Introduction


   1. Pursuant to permission to bring judicial review  proceedings  granted
      by Upper Tribunal Judge Finch dated 3 November  2017,  the  Applicant
      seeks an order quashing the decision of the Respondent  Secretary  of
      State dated 19 January  2017  whereby  she  refused  the  Applicant's
      application made on 22 November 2016 for indefinite leave  to  remain
      ("ILR") in the United Kingdom as a Tier  1  (General)  migrant,  that
      decision being affirmed on administrative review on 2 March 2017.


   2. The basis for the application for judicial  review  is  that  it  was
      irrational and unlawful for  the  Respondent  to  conclude  that  the
      Applicant had acted in the way which justified action under Paragraph
      322(5) of the Immigration Rules and in particular she did not have  a
      proper basis on which to conclude that the Applicant had  acted  with
      dishonesty and deceit in relation to a tax return made in respect  of
      the tax year ending 5 April 2012.


   3. It is the Respondent's case that  the  decision  to  refuse  ILR  was
      lawful and rational, that it was fully justified by the evidence  and
      was in  accordance  with  principles  and  precedents  laid  down  by
      previous case law.


   The Facts


   4. The Applicant is now aged 47 having been born on 26 December 1970 and
      his wife, Riffat is 54 having been born on 1 January 1964. They  have
      two sons, A1 born in March 2001 (17) and A2 born  in  July  2007  and
      aged 10.


   5. On 16 February 2009, the Applicant was granted leave to  enter  as  a
      Tier 1 (General) migrant  for  a  period  of  three  years  until  16
      February 2012 and he arrived with his family in  the  UK  on  4  July
      2009.


   6. On 18 January 2012, the Applicant submitted  an  in-time  application
      for leave to remain which was granted the same day and remained valid
      until 16 February 2014.  In that application, he claimed that he  had
      earned �36,000 in the period 16 May 2011 to  30  December  2011  from
      salaried employment as a director of AAS Professionals Ltd.  However,
      at some stage later in 2012, a tax return was submitted in which only
      the sum of �7,650 was declared for the year from 6 April  2011  to  5
      April 2012.


   7. On 20 January 2014, the  Applicant  made  a  further  application  to
      extend his leave which was granted on 6 February 2014 for  a  further
      period of three years expiring on 6 February 2017.


   8. On 20 July 2016, the Applicant made an application for ILR as a  Tier
      1 (General) migrant. Some five days previously, on 15 July 2016,  his
      accountants had written to HMRC stating that an  internal  audit  had
      revealed that there had been an error in the tax return for 2011/2012
      and an amended tax return was filed. That letter stated:

            "Recently it has come to  our  attention  during  our  internal
           audit that an incorrect year end submission was  made  to  HMRC.
           After detailed enquiry we found out that before  the  submission
           the computer that was used to file the year-end report  was  not
           working  properly  with  the  software.    One  of  our   former
           consultant who we used for submitting year-end reports  to  HMRC
           did not confirm the figures and end up submitting  an  incorrect
           year-end report with a total  of  �7,650  annual  gross  salary.
           This year-end report only provided with December 2011 salary  of
           �4,500 and January 2012's salary of �3,150.  The months from May
           2011 to  November  2011  were  omitted  out  of  the  report  we
           therefore request you to please see enclosed the amended  report
           providing the difference from the �39,150 (actual gross  salary)
           - �7,650 (submitted to HMRC) equals �31,500 (the difference)."



       The letter calculated a short-fall in tax paid of �14,719.13.


   9. The first refusal of ILR was contained in  a  letter  from  the  Home
      Office (UKVI) to the Applicant dated 20 July 2016.   The  application
      for ILR was rejected pursuant to Paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration
      Rules which relates to the refusal of leave to remain on the  grounds
      of "the undesirability of permitting the person concerned  to  remain
      in the United Kingdom in the  light  of  his  conduct,  character  or
      associations or the fact that he  represents  a  threat  to  national
      security."  The letter contained the following:

            "At your appointment on  20  July  2016  at  Sheffield  Premium
           Service Centre  you  were  asked  to  complete  a  questionnaire
           regarding your economic activities and your earnings  from  your
           employment.  Question 9 of the questionnaire asked:  Q - are you
           satisfied that the self-assessment tax returns submitted to HMRC
           accurately reflect your self-employed income?  A  -  you  ticked
           "Yes" to indicate you are satisfied that the self-assessment tax
           returns submitted to HMRC accurately reflect your  self-employed
           income. There is a considerable discrepancy between  the  amount
           of salaried earnings claimed to UKVI to the amount  of  salaried
           earnings  you  declared  to  HMRC.   It  is  acknowledged   that
           Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules  is  not  a  mandatory
           refusal, however the evidence submitted does not  satisfactorily
           demonstrate that the failure to declare to HMRC at the time  any
           of  the  self-employed  earnings  declared  on   your   previous
           application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier
           1 (General) migrant was a genuine error.  It is noted that there
           would have been a clear benefit to yourself either by failing to
           declare your full earnings to HMRC with respect to reducing your
           tax liability or by falsely representing  your  earnings  to  UK
           Visas and Immigration to enable you to meet the points  required
           to obtain leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1
           (General) migrant.


           The Secretary of State considers that it  would  be  undesirable
           for you to remain in the United Kingdom based on the  fact  that
           you have been deceitful or dishonest in your dealings with  HMRC
           and/or UK Visas and  Immigration  by  failing  to  declare  your
           claimed self-employed earnings to HMRC at  the  time  and/or  by
           falsely representing your self employed income to  obtain  leave
           to remain in the United Kingdom."

  10. On 22 November 2016, the Applicant submitted  a  further  application
      for ILR and, in support of that  application,  further  evidence  was
      provided at the request of the Secretary  of  State  on  28  November
      2016.   That  evidence  included  a  letter  from   the   Applicant's
      accountants, Accounts & Tax  World,  dated  14  November  2016.  That
      letter stated as follows:

           "UK Visas and Immigration Centre
           To whom it may concern
           Re: AAS Professional Ltd - Shahbaz Ahmad Khan
           NI number: [                   ]


           Dear Sir or Madam,
           We are the accountants for the above mentioned company  and  for
           Dr Shahbaz Ahmad Khan.  During the year-end 5  April  2012,  the
           P35/P14 was  submitted  to  HMRC  with  the  information  of  an
           employee  Dr  Shahbaz   Ahmad   Khan   holding   NI   number   [
                  ].  We confirm that the employee was on a salary from May
           2011 to December 2011 of �4,500 gross per month and from January
           2012 �3,150 gross for the month making a total of �39,150 annual
           gross salary.  It has come to our attention  that  an  incorrect
           year-end submission was made to HMRC.  After  detailed  enquiry,
           we found out that before the submission we had  a  problem  with
           our IT system and the software was not working properly.  One of
           our former  consultant  who  we  used  for  submitting  year-end
           reports to HMRC did not confirm  the  figures  with  responsible
           person and end up submitting an incorrect year-end report with a
           total of �7,650 annual gross salary.  This year-end report  only
           provided with December 2011 salary of �4,500 and January  2012's
           salary of �3,150.  The months from May  2011  to  November  2011
           were omitted out of the report.


           We would like to confirm that this was  just  a  clerical  error
           plus software issue, not our client  intentions.   We  apologise
           for any inconvenience this may have caused."

  11. The application for ILR was further considered by the Respondent  and
      refused on 19 January 2017.  The reasons for the decision given  were
      as follows:

           "Consideration has been  given  to  your  application  dated  18
           January 2012 when you applied for leave to remain in the  United
           Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) migrant and claimed 40 points  for
           earnings of �36,000 in the period 16 May  2011  to  30  December
           2011.  Your earnings were from one source:  salaried  employment
           as a director of a limited company, AS Professionals Ltd.


           When  assessing  your  application  of  22  November  2016   for
           indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  Tier  1  (General)   migrant,
           consideration  has  been  given  to  the  information  you  have
           provided to HMRC concerning your income from all employment.


           The  information  you  provided  to  HMRC  about  your  salaried
           employment as a director of  a  limited  company  had  a  direct
           impact on your tax liability and the amount of tax you would  be
           required to pay.  The information you  provided  to  UKVI  about
           your salaried employment as the director of  a  limited  company
           was required in order for you to obtain your  Tier  1  (General)
           visa.  On investigation it is clear that there  are  significant
           differences in the information you initially  provided  to  HMRC
           and the information you provided to UKVI.


           When reviewed,  it  was  apparent  to  UKVI  the  earnings  from
           salaried employment as the director of a limited company you had
           declared for the tax year 2011 to 2012 on your  application  was
           significantly different from the information you had declared to
           HMRC. You had UKVI salaried earnings of �36,000 in the period 16
           May 2011 to 30 December  2011  for  your  application  dated  18
           January 2012.


           Information provided to us from HMRC confirms that for the  year
           6 April 2011 to  5  April  2012  you  originally  only  declared
           �7,650.  On 20 July 2016 you made an application for  indefinite
           leave to remain which was refused on character  and  conduct  as
           you failed to declare your full earnings for  the  tax  year  06
           April 2011 to 05 April  2012.   You  have  now  made  a  further
           application for indefinite leave to remain and provided a letter
           from your accountant dated 14 November 2016  which  provides  an
           explanation regarding the substantial discrepancy and  a  letter
           from HMRC dated 9 September 2016 stating your records have  been
           amended and asking for the increased tax liability to be paid.


           Your amended tax returns to HMRC are acknowledged  and  it  [is]
           recognised you have a revised tax liability  figure  from  HMRC.
           However, it is considered you should have taken reasonable  care
           to ensure your tax returns were correctly submitted.  This would
           include verification that your returns  had  been  submitted  to
           HMRC  with  the  correct  earnings  declared.    Although   your
           accountant stated that the error was a  clerical  one  on  their
           part it is taken that as your earnings are  based  on  turnover,
           minus costs, equals profit we would consider this to be  routine
           work that is not complex and therefore  you  should  have  taken
           reasonable care to ensure the correct returns had been submitted
           to HMRC.  Further, it is only  after  being  called  to  account
           within your previous refusal that you have reviewed and  amended
           your returns.


           The fact that you have retrospectively  declared  these  claimed
           earnings to HMRC is not sufficient to satisfy the  Secretary  of
           State that you have not previously been deceitful  or  dishonest
           in your dealings with HMRC and/or UK Visas and Immigration.


           Your actions in declaring different amounts of  income  to  HMRC
           and UKVI lead to the conclusion that in light of your  character
           and conduct it will be undesirable to allow you to remain in the
           United Kingdom.  Your character  and  conduct  with  regards  to
           declaring  your  income  would  lead  to  a  refusal   of   your
           application under general  grounds  paragraph  322  (5)  of  the
           Immigration Rules.  Whilst a refusal under paragraph 322 (5)  of
           the Immigration  Rules  is  not  a  mandatory  decision,  it  is
           considered your actions in declaring different  income  to  HMRC
           and UKVI would mean that a refusal under paragraph  322  (5)  is
           appropriate."

      The Secretary of State also considered  the  Applicant's  application
      for ILR under paragraph 245CD of the Immigration Rules and found that
      the Applicant did not meet the requirements of that paragraph because
      the Secretary of State did not accept that the  earnings  claimed  in
      the application were genuine earnings from salaried employment as the
      director of a limited company.


  12. On 2 February 2017, the Applicant applied for  Administrative  Review
      of the Respondent's decision of 19 January 2017 on the basis that she
      had "applied the Immigration  Rules  incorrectly".   The  application
      included the following additional submissions:

           "In relation to the discrepancy, the accountant responsible  for
           filing the returns had communicated the underpayment of taxes in
           a letter dated 15 July 2016 and 26  August  2016.   Indeed,  the
           correspondence was acknowledged by the HMRC according  to  their
           letter dated  9  September  2016.  The  SSHD  has  not  properly
           assessed this context, and it was, we submit, incumbent upon the
           SSHD to clarify with HMRC the correct  position.   Particularly,
           given the extent of the co-operation between the two departments
           in liaising with one  another.   The  Applicant  never  had  the
           intention to deceive the Home  Office  and  this  is  very  much
           evident from HMRC letter dated 9  September  2016  that  he  did
           correspond on 15 July 2016 with HMRC even  before  applying  for
           settlement application on 20 July 2016.  Home Office  failed  to
           give any importance to this regard while considering Applicant's
           intentions.
           ...
           Essentially, in the previous five years of  tax  returns,  there
           has been one period owing to an innocent mistake perpetrated  by
           the financial adviser, who was obliged to file the said accounts
           in the correct manner, which has  resulted  in  the  Applicant's
           settlement application being refused.  We submit  that  decision
           is unlawful, as the SSHD has failed in her duty to ascertain the
           position from the  other  government  department.   The  further
           assessment in the current application is similarly  unlawful  as
           no  attempt  has  been  made  by  the  SSHD  to  ascertain   the
           genuineness of the income relied upon. ... It is clear that  the
           underpayment of tax arising from the error on the  part  of  the
           accountant firm "Accounts & Tax World" was made  clear  to  HMRC
           prior to the  application  for  settlement  being  made  in  the
           penultimate application (see attached  letter  from  HMRC  dated
           9/9/16)."



  13.  Additionally,  the  application  for  Administrative   Review   drew
      attention to the Respondent's guidance in respect of paragraph 322(5)
      of the Immigration Rules as follows:

           "When deciding whether to refuse under this  category,  the  key
           thing to consider is if there is reliable evidence to support  a
           decision that the person's behaviour calls into  question  their
           character and/or conduct and/or their associations to the extent
           that this is undesirable to allow them to enter or remain in the
           UK."

  14. The Administrative Review was carried out on 2  March  2017  and  the
      decision  of  19  January  2017  was  maintained.   The  reasons  for
      maintaining the decision include the following:

           "Whilst you claim that the fault with your tax  return  was  the
           error of the accountant who completed this return,  and  despite
           the letter  from  said  accountant  taking  the  blame  for  the
           mistake, the onus is on you to ensure the  information  provided
           to all  government  departments  is  accurate  at  the  time  of
           submission.  As your accounts are not deemed to be  particularly
           complex it  is  ultimately  your  responsibility  and  not  your
           accountant's to ensure  that  the  figures  are  correct  before
           submission.   We  do  acknowledge  that  the  tax  returns  have
           recently been amended and the overdue tax paid, however, this is
           not enough to satisfy the Secretary of State  that  the  initial
           discrepancy caused them to question your character  and  conduct
           when dealing with government departments.  The advantage to  you
           of either decreasing your income to lower your tax liability, or
           inflating your income to ensure your  Tier  1  leave  to  remain
           application is approved, is noted by  the  Secretary  of  State.
           This  applies  regardless  of  any   recent   amendments   made.
           Moreover, we do appreciate that the  discrepancy  only  occurred
           with one of your tax returns and that the [law] does not  define
           certain time scales for amending your tax returns, but as it  is
           UKVI's  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  migrants  granted
           settlement are of good character and conduct  it  is  imperative
           that we take into account all aspects of previous  earnings  and
           investigate any variation as and when [it] occurs."



   In relation to the paragraph 245CD  determination,  the  review  decision
   stated that the original caseworker  had  not  assessed  the  Applicant's
   current earnings in the light of the concerns raised over the genuineness
   of previous earnings but that he had been  refused  ILR  under  paragraph
   322(5), this being a refusal on the basis of character and  conduct.   It
   was stated:

           "The original caseworker has not refused your application on the
           grounds of deception therefore there is no burden of proof  from
           the Secretary of State in that regard."



   These proceedings


  15. A pre-action protocol letter was sent on 23  March  2017  challenging
      the decisions of 19 January 2017 and 2 March 2017  and  a  letter  of
      response dated 28 March 2017 from the Secretary of State refuted  the
      allegations in the PAP letter and maintained that the decision of the
      Secretary of State  was  lawful  and  consistent  with  the  relevant
      Immigration Rules.


  16. An application seeking permission to apply for  judicial  review  was
      made supported by a statement of facts dated 13 May 2017.   Paragraph
      3 of the statement of facts made reference to the health  of  one  of
      the Applicant's children, A2, who was treated for a brain tumour.  It
      was pleaded:

           "Given what was happening to his child at the time of  the  2012
           application for further  leave  to  remain,  the  Applicant  was
           constantly pre-occupied with the safety and  well-being  of  his
           child - who was undergoing life-saving treatment.   This  was  a
           factor affecting the otherwise rigorous attention given  by  him
           to his tax returns.  It was for these reasons and the  error  on
           the part of his accountant that the Applicant's tax  return  for
           2012 was incorrect.   But  for  the  reasons  mentioned  in  the
           foregoing affecting the Applicant's said child, the  Applicant's
           oversight of his tax returns was, uncharacteristically,  not  as
           rigorous as would ordinarily be the case.


           The main burden of the statement of facts was  that,  in  making
           her decision, the Secretary of State had in  effect  substituted
           her own view of the tax return in question  for  that  of  HMRC.
           Thus, it was pleaded that "it is not for the SSHD  to  introduce
           her own interpretation of the workings  of  HMRC."   Given  that
           HMRC were  satisfied  with  the  explanation  in  2016  for  the
           erroneous tax return relating to the tax  year  ending  6  April
           2012 and accepted the amended tax return, it was  pleaded  that:
           "The SSHD has failed to explain why, in her judgement, her  view
           of a tax filing correction is  the  better  view  than  the  tax
           authorities' view - who neither rebuked/criticised nor took  any
           step towards punishing the Applicant for  making  a  mistake  in
           filing his return for the relevant 2011/2012 period. "



      It was further stated that the Secretary of State had failed to act in
      a fair manner in determining whether the Applicant  had  actually  met
      the financial requirements qualifying him  for  the  requisite  points
      according to the points based system requirements  and  that  she  had
      failed to follow the guidance entitled "General grounds  for  refusal"
      which includes the following:

           "When deciding whether to refuse under this  category,  the  key
           thing is to consider if there is reliable evidence to support  a
           decision that the person's behaviour calls into  question  their
           character and/or their conduct and/or their associations to  the
           extent it is undesirable to allow them to enter or remain in the
           UK."



  17. In detailed grounds of defence, the Secretary of  State  pleads  that
      the kind of arguments advanced by the Applicant  in  this  case  have
      been considered in a string of previous cases and have been  rejected
      on a consistent basis.  I shall refer to  these  judgments  and  what
      they signify for the purposes of the court's  determination  of  this
      application at paragraph 27 below.  Other  aspects  of  the  detailed
      grounds of defence are dealt with in the arguments adduced on  behalf
      of the Secretary of State for the purposes of the hearing 14 February
      2018 and are dealt with below.


  18. On 8 November 2017, permission  to  apply  for  judicial  review  was
      granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Finch who stated the following:

           "(9) In the refusal letter, the Respondent did take into account
           the evidence provided by the Applicant's accountants but did not
           provide any reason for  concluding  that  they  themselves  were
           seeking to deceive her when they said that the  discrepancy  had
           arisen because of a clerical error.  Furthermore there was  only
           one discrepancy amongst many years  of  returns  and  supporting
           documents and there  was  no  history  of  the  Applicant  using
           deception. Counsel for the Applicant also submitted that it  was
           reasonable for the Applicant  to  rely  on  the  skills  of  his
           professional accountant."



      Having  stated  that  the  previous  decisions  relied  upon  by   the
      Respondent were fact specific and that the  Respondent  must  exercise
      her discretion in the  particular  circumstances  of  each  individual
      case, UTJ Finch decided that "it is arguable that  it  was  irrational
      and unlawful to conclude that the Applicant  had  acted  in  a  manner
      which justified action under paragraph  322  (5)  of  the  Immigration
      Rules."


      UTJ Finch also stated that it was


           "arguable  that  the  Respondent's   own   decision-making   was
           contradictory and   therefore irrational.  For example, on p3 of
           her decision dated 19 January 2017, in  the  paragraph  starting
           "Your amended tax returns", the Respondent both asserts that the
           Applicant should have taken reasonable care to ensure  your  tax
           returns  were  correctly  submitted  and  that   retrospectively
           declaring his income to the HMRC is not  sufficient  to  satisfy
           her that the Applicant had  not  previously  been  deceitful  or
           dishonest."






       It was said that the decision reached by the Respondent was  arguably
       irrational and unlawful by reference to Royal Brunei Airlines  v  Tan
       [1995] UKPC 4 where Lord Nicholls  said  that  "carelessness  is  not
       dishonesty".


  19.  Subsequently, the Applicant has filed a response to the Respondent's
      detailed grounds of defence on 31 December 2017 and  a  supplementary
      response on 15 January 2018 which, again, incorporate  the  arguments
      which were marshalled for the purposes of the hearing before me.


   The Hearing


  20. For the purposes of the hearing on 14  February  2018,  both  parties
      submitted skeleton arguments which were then elaborated upon in  oral
      submissions.


   The Applicant's submissions

  21. In his skeleton argument, Mr Gajjar  first  focuses  on  the  refusal
      letter of 19 January 2017 where the Secretary of State stated:


           "However it is considered that you should have taken  reasonable
           care to ensure your tax returns were correctly  submitted.  This
           would include verification that your returns had been  submitted
           to HMRC with the correct earnings declared"



      Later in the letter there is further reference to the failure  of  the
      Applicant to take reasonable care to ensure that the  correct  returns
      had been submitted to HMRC.  It is submitted by  Mr  Gajjar  that  the
      refusal letter read as a whole  does  not  support  the  Secretary  of
      State's allegation of deception and dishonesty and did not satisfy the
      burden or standard of proof for establishing dishonesty.  Reliance  is
      again placed on the  dictum  of  Lord  Nichols  in  the  Royal  Brunei
      Airlines case and also on the decision of the Supreme Court in Ivey  v
      Genting Casino Limited [2017] UKSC 67 at paragraph  74  where  it  was
      said:

           "When dishonesty is in question the fact-finding  tribunal  must
           first  ascertain  (subjectively)  the  actual   state   of   the
           individual's  knowledge  or  belief  as  to   the   facts.   The
           reasonableness or  otherwise  of  his  belief  is  a  matter  of
           evidence (often in practice determinative) going to  whether  he
           held the belief but it is not an additional requirement that his
           belief must  be  reasonable;  the  question  is  whether  it  is
           genuinely held. When  once  his  actual  state  of  mind  as  to
           knowledge or belief as to facts  is  established,  the  question
           whether his conduct is honest or dishonest is to  be  determined
           by the fact-finder by  applying  the  (objective)  standards  of
           ordinary decent  people.   There  is  no  requirement  that  the
           defendant must appreciate that what he has  done  is,  by  those
           standards, dishonest."



      On this basis, it is submitted that the references to carelessness  in
      the decision letter show that the test for  dishonesty  has  not  been
      made out.


  22. A further  important,  indeed  principal,  part  of  the  Applicant's
      argument was that, by accepting that the mistake had been theirs, the
      Applicant's accountants "fell on their sword" by  confirming  that  a
      clerical error had  occurred  in  relation  to  the  tax  return  for
      2011/2012 owing to a combination of a  software  issue  and  a  human
      error on their part. In this regard,  reliance  is  placed  upon  the
      decision of Mr Justice Collins in R (on the application of Samant)  v
      Secretary of State for the Home  Department  JR/6546/2017.   In  that
      case, as here, the Secretary of  State  refused  an  application  for
      indefinite leave to remain on the basis that the Applicant  had  made
      tax returns, in particular for the year ending April 2013, which  did
      not coincide with the figures  put  to  the  Secretary  of  State  in
      relation to his earnings.  In that case, the decision maker had said:



           "Were it accepted that the figure declared to  the  Home  Office
           was an accurate representation of your earnings between February
           2012 and January 2013, your actions in failing to  declare  your
           earnings in full to HM  Revenue  and  Customs  would  lead  your
           application to  be  refused  under  paragraph  322  (5)  of  the
           Immigration Rules based on your character  and  conduct,  as  it
           would be considered that you had been deceitful or dishonest  in
           your dealings with HM Revenue and Customs."



       Mr Justice Collins reminded himself that the test to  be  applied  in
       establishing dishonesty is on the balance of  probabilities  but  "it
       has often been said that the more serious an allegation  the  greater
       the level of probability, if that is the right  way  of  putting  it,
       that has to be established and there is no question that in order  to
       establish dishonesty the higher  level  of  the  balance  has  to  be
       applied, albeit this is still the balance of probability."   He  then
       went on to say this (and this lies at the heart  of  the  Applicant's
       submission in this case):

           "11. The difficulty, as  I  see  it  in  the  case  put  by  the
           Applicant, is that he has asserted that he was given  particular
           advice that would enable him to put  in  the  expenses  that  he
           relied on to  reduce  his  tax  liabilities,  but  there  is  no
           evidence produced by either the original accountants Oasis,  who
           made the report, or  any  subsequent  accountant  who  may  have
           spotted the error and dealt with it. If it were  accepted  by  a
           representative of the accountants that he was so  advised,  that
           would be an exceedingly powerful point in his favour.   Equally,
           of course, it would be damaging to him if it were  not  accepted
           that any such advice had been given."



       Whilst the issue in Samant's  case  was  whether  the  Applicant  had
       legitimately reduced his tax liability  by  claiming  expenses  which
       were not properly claimable  but  which  he  had  been  advised  were
       claimable by his accountant, and so was not the same error as in  the
       present case, it is submitted by Mr Gajjar that the principle is  the
       same: if an error in  a  tax  return,  whether  in  relation  to  the
       expenses that can be claimed or the  earnings  that  are  stated,  is
       attributable not to the dishonesty of the Applicant but to  an  error
       by   the   accountants,   then   that   is   not   dishonesty.     In
       contradistinction to Samant's case, here the Applicant has  submitted
       to the Secretary of State evidence from his accountants acknowledging
       that the mistake was theirs and therefore it is  submitted  that  the
       finding of dishonesty is unjustified and irrational.  Carelessness is
       insufficient and the  references  to  carelessness  in  the  decision
       letter shows that the Secretary of State has misdirected herself.


  23.  It is further submitted by Mr Gajjar on behalf of the Applicant that
      there is nothing implausible about the evidence from the  Applicant's
      accountant that the error in the  2012  tax  return  was  wholly  the
      accountant's fault.  It is pointed out that lack  of  genuineness  in
      relation to the letter of 14 November 2016 from the accountant is not
      part of the reasons for the Secretary of State's decision.   This  is
      in contrast to the submissions made on behalf of the Respondent where
      it is stated:

           "The letter then suggests that there was 'just a clerical  error
           plus software issue'.  This is simply incredible.   It  is  very
           difficult, if not  impossible  to  believe  that  a  significant
           amount just disappeared from the figures and  no-one  (including
           the Applicant) noticed until 15 July 2016."



      Thus, Mr Gajjar submits that, in seeking to uphold this decision,  the
      Respondent is going significantly further  than  the  decision  letter
      itself.


  24. It is further pointed out that there is a significant  error  in  the
      decision letter where it states:

           "Further, it is only after being called to account  within  your
           previous  refusal  that  you  have  reviewed  and  amended  your
           returns."



      From the chronology, it is observed that this  is  not  correct:   the
      Applicant, through his accountant, wrote to HMRC on 15 July 2016 which
      was five days before the application of 20 July 2016.


  25. Finally, Mr Gajjar refers to the decision letter of 19  January  2017
      where the Respondent states:

           "The fact that you have retrospectively declared  these  claimed
           earnings to HMRC is not sufficient to satisfy the  Secretary  of
           State that you have not previously been deceitful  or  dishonest
           in your dealings with HMRC and/or UK Visas and Immigration."



      In this regard, it is submitted that the  Respondent  has  misdirected
      herself as it is not for the Applicant to  satisfy  the  Secretary  of
      State that he has not  previously  been  deceitful  or  dishonest  but
      rather it is necessary for the Secretary of State to be  satisfied  on
      plausible and credible evidence that the Applicant has been  deceitful
      or dishonest. He reminds the Tribunal of the test for  dishonesty  set
      out in Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan [1995] UKPC 4 where  Lord  Nicholls
      stated that acting dishonestly, or with a lack of probity,  means  not
      acting as an  honest  person  would  in  the  circumstances  and  that
      carelessness is not dishonesty.  This  was  endorsed  by  the  Supreme
      Court in Ivey v Genting Casino Limited [2017] UKSC 67 at paragraphs 74
      where it was said:

           "When dishonesty is in question the fact-finding  Tribunal  must
           first  ascertain  (subjectively)  the  actual   state   of   the
           individual's knowledge or belief as to the acts.  ... when  once
           his actual state of mind as to knowledge or belief as  to  facts
           is established, the question whether his conduct was  honest  or
           dishonest is to be determined by the fact-finder by applying the
           (objective) standards of ordinary decent people."



      In this context, it is submitted that the test for dishonesty was  not
      made out and at best all the Secretary of State  could  properly  have
      found that the Applicant had been negligent in failing to  verify  the
      work of his accountants.


   The Respondent's submissions


  26. On  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr  Malik  set  out  five
      propositions of law which he said (and Mr Gajjar confirmed), are  not
      in dispute.  These are as follows


           i)   The question as to whether a person's character or  conduct
              is questionable for the purposes of paragraph 322(5)  of  the
              Immigration Rules is a question for the Secretary of State to
              consider and  determine.   The  Secretary  of  State  is  the
              primary decision maker with the  relevant  expertise  and  is
              charged by parliament to finding  the  facts  and  exercising
              judgement. The Secretary of State's findings and  conclusions
              may be challenged only on conventional public law grounds.  A
              judicial review of a decision to refuse an application  under
              paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules  is  not  a  merit-
              based appeal and the issue for the reviewing court is whether
              the decision taken by the Secretary of State falls within the
              range of reasonable responses.


          ii) The legality of the Secretary of State's decision  to  refuse
              an application for leave to remain under paragraph 322(5)  of
              the Immigration Rules must be assessed by  reference  to  the
              material that was before the decision maker when the decision
              was made.  Thus evidence or explanations put  forward  by  an
              applicant  either  with  his   subsequent   application   for
              administrative review or during the course of judicial review
              proceedings are not relevant. In this regard, I  am  referred
              to R (Giri) v SSHD [2016] 1 WLR where  the  Court  of  Appeal
              rejected the submission  on  behalf  of  the  Applicant  that
              whether one  of  the  grounds  for  refusing  leave  actually
              existed was a precedent fact for determination by the  court.
              It was held that the question whether an applicant for  leave
              to remain had failed to disclose  a  material  fact  for  the
              purposes  of  paragraph  322(1A)  of  the  Rules  was  not  a
              precedent  fact   for   determination:   the   question   for
              determination by the  court  was  whether  the  Secretary  of
              State's decision was reasonable and lawful.  At paragraph 19,
              Richards LJ stated:

                  "The key point is that the statute confers  the  power  on
                  the Secretary of State, or the immigration officers acting
                  on her behalf, to make the decision whether  to  grant  or
                  refuse leave to remain.  It is for the Secretary of  State
                  or her officials, in the exercise of  that  power  and  in
                  reaching their decision, to determine which provisions  of
                  the  Rules  apply  and  whether  relevant  conditions  are
                  satisfied,  including  the   determination   of   relevant
                  questions of fact. On the reasoning in X v Khawaja and X v
                  Bugdaycay, their findings on  such  matters  are  open  to
                  challenge  in  judicial   review   proceedings   only   on
                  Wednesbury principles; it is not a  situation  that  their
                  powers depend on some  precedent  fact  the  existence  of
                  which falls to determination by the court itself."

         iii)   The Secretary of State is entitled  to  refuse  a  person's
              application under paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules
              if she rationally concludes that he has not  been  completely
              honest or transparent in relation to his income  either  with
              the Home Office or with HMRC.  This is  consistent  with  the
              text of the Rule  and  the  Secretary  of  State's  published
              guidance.


          iv)   The Secretary of State is entitled  to  refuse  a  person's
              application under paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules
              on the basis of matters concerning his tax even if  HMRC  has
              taken no action against the Applicant.


           v)    It is not a defence for a  person  who  has  been  refused
              under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules on the  basis
              of  matters  concerning  his  tax  return  to  say  that  his
              accountant or agent was responsible for the discrepancies.  A
              person is personally responsible  for  his  tax  matters  and
              dealings with HMRC.  In relation to the burden  and  standard
              of proof, Mr Malik referred again to  Giri  at  paragraph  36
              where Richards LJ referred to his previous judgment in R  (N)
              v Mental Health  Review  Tribunal  (Northern  Region)  [2006]
              QB468 where he had said at paragraph 62:

                  "Although there is a single civil standard of proof on the
                  balance  of  probabilities,  it   is   flexible   in   its
                  application.   In  particular,  the   more   serious   the
                  allegation or the more serious  the  consequences  if  the
                  allegation is proved, the stronger must  be  the  evidence
                  before a court will  find  an  allegation  proved  on  the
                  balance of probabilities.  Thus  the  flexibility  of  the
                  standard lies not in  any  adjustment  to  the  degree  of
                  probability required for an allegation to be proved  (such
                  that a more serious allegation  has  to  be  proved  to  a
                  higher degree of probability),  but  in  the  strength  or
                  quality of the evidence that will in practice be  required
                  for  an  allegation  to  be  proved  on  the  balance   of
                  probabilities."

      In Giri, Richards LJ went on  to  point  out  that  his  statement  of
      principle in the previous case had been subsequently approved  by  the
      House of Lords in In Re D (Secretary of  State  for  Northern  Ireland
      intervening) [2008] 1WLR1499 (see  per  Lord  Carswell  at  para  27).
      Again, in the case of in Re B (Children) (Care  proceedings:  standard
      of proof) (CAFCASS intervening) [2009] AC 11, Lord Hoffman stated:

           "I think that the time has come to say, once and for  all,  that
           there is only one civil standard of proof and that is proof that
           the fact in issue more probably occurred than not."



      Richards LJ, in Giri, also referred  to  the  case  of  NA  (Pakistan)
      [2009] UKAIT 31 where the Tribunal said:

           "However, we do agree ... that the consequences of refusal under
           part 9 can be serious and that is  certainly  true  for  persons
           such as the three claimants who, depending on findings  of  fact
           made by the Tribunal may find themselves, if  removed  from  the
           UK, faced with a five to ten year re-entry  ban  ...  whilst  we
           would note that  Lord  Hoffman  in  Re  B  emphasised  that  the
           seriousness of the  consequences  do  not  require  a  different
           standard of proof, we do  accept  that  for  the  Respondent  to
           satisfy us he has discharged the burden of proof on him  on  the
           balance of probabilities he would, in the context of  this  type
           of case, need to furnish evidence  of  sufficient  strength  and
           quality and he (and the Tribunal) would need to subject it to  a
           'critical', 'anxious' and 'heightened' scrutiny."



       Richards LJ was concerned that the expression  "heightened  scrutiny"
       should not be treated  as  a  surrogate  for  the  application  of  a
       "heightened standard of proof" but otherwise approved the approach of
       the Tribunal as being consistent with the authorities on the standard
       of proof.


  27. In response to Mr Gajjar's reliance on the case of Samant,  Mr  Malik
      referred me to a series of  subsequent  cases  where  applicants  had
      "jumped on the band wagon" but the  Tribunal  had  rejected  evidence
      blaming the accountants.  Thus:


           i) In Kamal v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  (Case
              number JR/11417/2016) a  decision  of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
              Gleeson of 31 August 2017, the Applicant had made  discrepant
              declarations of his employed and self-employed income for the
              tax year 2010-11 as follows:


                    a) On 6 April  2011  in  his  Tier  1  application,  the
                       Applicant claimed total earnings of �40,665.74.


                    b) In his  HMRC  tax  return  for  the  same  year,  the
                       Applicant claimed and paid tax on total  earnings  of
                       �12,330.


                    c) On 13 January 2014, almost three years  after  filing
                       his incorrect tax return, the Applicant notified HMRC
                       of an under declaration for  2010/2011  but  the  new
                       figures disclosed a continuing discrepancy of  almost
                       �8,000 between the April 2011 declared income and the
                       January 2014 adjustment.  In that case, a letter from
                       the Applicant's accountants cut  no  ice  with  Judge
                       Gleeson. He said:

                           "The  letter  from  the   accountants   accepting
                           responsibility  takes  matters  no  further:  the
                           responsibility for accounting properly for income
                           is  always  that  of  the  tax  payer   and   the
                           difference here is so huge  that  the  Respondent
                           was unarguably  entitled  to  consider  that  the
                           Applicant   could   not   have   overlooked    it
                           innocently."



          ii) Parveen and Saleem v SSHD (Case  number  JR/9440/2016):  this
              was another decision of Upper Tribunal  Judge  Gleeson  on  1
              August 2017.  Again, indefinite leave to remain  was  refused
              by the SSHD based upon a significant under-declaration in tax
              returns in 2011 and 2013 which  conflicted  with  the  income
              figures given in historic visa applications.  Thus:


                    a) On 31 March 2011 the Applicant claimed 20 points  for
                       earnings of �38,092.79 for the period 3 February 2010
                       to 4 February 2011 which included earnings from self-
                       employment of �23,849 but in the declaration to  HMRC
                       for the same period, the self-employment  income  was
                       declared as �2,013, not �23,849.


                    b) On 11 May 2013 the application for a  visa  disclosed
                       self-employed income of  �32,340  but,  on  the  HMRC
                       return, the Applicant declared only  �694  for  self-
                       employed earnings.  There was no tax  return  at  all
                       for the year ending April 2014.  In May 2016 when the
                       Applicant and her husband were  preparing  for  their
                       application for ILR, they visited the accountant  who
                       admitted to filing two incorrect returns and  it  was
                       their case that the accountant did not tell  them  at
                       the time that he had filed no return at all for 2014.




                       Judge Gleeson stated:

                           "The    principal    Applicant    has    personal
                           responsibility for her tax  returns.   She  would
                           have been aware that she paid much less tax  than
                           would normally have been due on such a  large  of
                           amount of self-employed income.   The  difference
                           in her claimed income is not marginal nor is  the
                           difference in liability to tax.   The  additional
                           tax to be paid is over �15,000."



                      Again, the attempt to blame the  accountants  cut  no
                      ice with


                      Judge Gleeson who stated:

                           "61.  It is  beyond  credit  that  the  principal
                           Applicant  could   have   mistaken   the   amount
                           chargeable to tax  for  the  small  self-employed
                           income she declared for the correct  tax  charged
                           for the large income  now  relied  upon,  however
                           incompetent her accountants may have been."



         iii)   Pathan v SSHD (Case number  JR/12657/2017)  a  decision  of
              Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington dated  27  October  2017.   In
              this case, when making a  previous  application  for  Tier  1
              leave on 1 April 2011, the  Applicant  had  claimed  to  have
              earned �23,436 net profit  as  a  self-employed  sole  trader
              during the period from 1 August 2010  to  28  February  2011.
              However, checks with HMRC revealed  that  for  the  financial
              year ending April 2011, he had declared  a  net  profit  from
              self-employed trading in the sum of �7,948 a  discrepancy  of
              �15,488.   Again,  the  Applicant   sought   to   blame   his
              accountants  at  the  relevant   time.   In   answer   to   a
              questionnaire he had stated "the  first  accountant  ...  did
              mistakes and submitted wrong amount for year 2010/11.   So  I
              changed the accountant and sent  revised  self  return".   In
              refusing ILR, the SSHD had noted that prior to submitting his
              tax return for the period 2010/11, the  documents  needed  to
              prepare it would have been supplied by the Applicant  to  the
              accountant dealing with  his  tax  affairs.  Furthermore  the
              Applicant would have had sight of the tax calculation  issued
              by HMRC.  Thus, if an error had occurred, the Applicant would
              have noted it and contacted HMRC  immediately.   It  was  the
              Applicant's responsibility  to  ensure  his  tax  return  was
              submitted both on time and with the correct  information  and
              that by failing to do  so  it  was  considered  he  had  been
              deceitful or dishonest.  In  her  judgment,  Judge  Rimington
              found that the SSHD was rationally  entitled  to  reject  the
              Applicant's explanation that his previous accountants were to
              blame  and  to  hold  him  responsible  for  the  information
              provided to HMRC in 2011 and to conclude that the failure  to
              declare the true position, either to HMRC or to UKVI in  2011
              was not a genuine error.  She went on to say:

                     "40.  Insofar as it was stated that the  Applicant  was
                    not an  accountant  and  was  at  worst  negligent,  the
                    decision maker gave a clear and cogent reason why it was
                    considered  his  explanation  was  not  accepted.    The
                    Applicant was responsible for the returns on his  behalf
                    to the HMRC.  His MBA certificate which he  obtained  in
                    2008 was submitted as part of  his  Tier  1  application
                    showed that  he  had  taken  and  managed  to  pass  the
                    "Managing Finance Unit" and was therefore familiar  with
                    the financial business practice."



             In relation to the mistake by the accountant, Judge  Rimington
             said:

                    "46.  It is correct that accountants can  make  mistakes
                    but the information that was  before  the  Secretary  of
                    State was that the Applicant had a Masters  in  Business
                    Administration, not  least  a  finance  module  and  the
                    Secretary of State in her reasoning considered that  not
                    only had he provided the financial  information  to  the
                    accountant, but even  if  the  accountant  had  made  an
                    error, it was considered that the Applicant  would  have
                    contacted the HMRC immediately on receipt of his own tax
                    documentation to correct such an error.  In  effect  the
                    Secretary of State had stated that the Applicant delayed
                    and waited nearly five years to submit a revised  figure
                    to HMRC and that was a matter of days before he made  an
                    application for indefinite leave to remain."



             The application for judicial  review  was  dismissed  and  the
             decision of the Secretary  of  State  was  upheld.   Mr  Malik
             submits that the facts in Pathan were very similar to those in
             the present case. He rejected any suggestion that  only  those
             who have studied  accountancy  are  capable  of  understanding
             their tax obligations.  He pointed out that the  Applicant  in
             the present case ran his own company and could be expected  to
             have known his obligations to HMRC.


          iv) Abbasi v SSHD (Case  number  JR/13807/2016),  a  decision  of
              Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington dated 9 January 2018.  In this
              case, when applying for leave to remain in December 2010, the
              Applicant  had  stated  he  had  earned  �43,926  from  self-
              employment in his business entitled "Abbasi  Accountancy  and
              Financial Services" for the period  1  November  2009  to  31
              October 2010.  In a further application in July 2013  he  had
              stated that his income for the period 1 July 2012 to 30  June
              2013 had been �53,504.44.  However,  HMRC  records  indicated
              that the Applicant had not paid  tax  as  required  on  those
              earnings and the Secretary of State refused ILR  pursuant  to
              paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.   The  Applicant's
              case was that as soon as  he  discovered  that  his  previous
              accountants had made a mistake about his tax liabilities  for
              his self-employed income, he had taken steps  to  remedy  the
              default and that he had explained this to the Respondent when
              he applied  for  ILR.   In  dismissing  the  application  for
              judicial review, Judge Rimington stated:

                    "76.  In my view,  on  the  facts,  there  was  a  solid
                    foundation on which the Secretary of State could make  a
                    rational  decision.   On  the  facts  as  presented  the
                    Secretary of State's response was unarguably within  the
                    range of reasonable responses.  She  asked  herself  the
                    correct question on the relevant facts.   The  Applicant
                    knew he was self-employed and had for at least three tax
                    years made a nil declaration for self-employed  earnings
                    which supported an application to UKVI; it was  not  the
                    case that earnings  were  just  a  discrepancy.   It  is
                    unarguable that dishonesty could be inferred.


                    77.  I list my reasoning found  in  relation  to  ground
                    (iii). Deficiencies in tax returns and  failure  to  pay
                    tax can infer dishonesty and it is open to the Secretary
                    of State to apply paragraph 322 (5) to such cases."



  28.   In his written submissions,  Mr  Malik  sought  to  rely  on  other
      previous decisions of the  UTIAC  in  similar  vein:  Varghase  (Case
      number JR/5167/2016),  Kawos  (Case  number  JR/4700/2016),  Vellanki
      (Case number JR/11008/2016), Majumder (Case number JR/4700/2016)  and
      Menon (Case number JR/7719/2016).  Mr Malik submitted:

           "The Upper Tribunal  is  respectfully  invited  to  follow  this
           consistent line of authority in  relation  to  cases  concerning
           paragraph 322 (5) of the Immigration Rules and tax matters,  and
           dismiss the Applicant's claim."

  29.   Mr Malik referred to the statement of facts dated 30 March 2017  in
      which the Applicant had relied upon the brain tumour of  his  younger
      son, A2 and where it was pleaded:

           "Given what was happening to his child at the time of  the  2012
           application for further  leave  to  remain,  the  Applicant  was
           constantly preoccupied with the safety and  well  being  of  his
           child - who was undergoing life saving treatment.   This  was  a
           factor affecting the otherwise rigorous attention given  to  his
           tax returns.  ... But for the reasons mentioned in the foregoing
           affecting the Applicant's said child, the Applicant oversight of
           his tax returns was, uncharacteristically, not  as  rigorous  as
           would ordinarily be the case."



       Mr Malik  submitted  that  there  were  two  difficulties  with  this
       pleading: first, these matters had not been put to  the  SSHD  before
       she reached her decision and had not been part of the evidence relied
       upon by the Applicant  when  he  made  his  application  for  ILR  in
       November 2016 although, given the  decision  of  20  July  2016,  the
       Applicant would have known that the tax return for  the  year  ending
       April 2012 would be at the front of the SSHD's decision and therefore
       any matters pertinent to why that tax return had been  made  when  it
       was false would be important.  Secondly, the actual medical  evidence
       relied upon suggested that the symptoms which led to the resection of
       the tumour on 6 March 2013 had arisen relatively  recently,  but  the
       tax return would have been made in the course  of  2012,  before  the
       concern over the child's health would have arisen.  Thus, in a letter
       from Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children  to  the  Home  Office
       dated 16 November 2016, a  social  worker,  Miss  Marina  Ellis,  had
       stated:

           "That A2 had presented with an episode of  seizures  in  January
           2010 but after the family returned to the UK in April  2011  'A2
           remained well' until March  2013  when  he  again  presented  to
           Newham University Hospital with severe headaches and vomiting  -
           he immediately had a scan and was found to have a brain tumour."



  30.   In summary, Mr Malik submitted that it has not been shown that  the
      Secretary  of  State's  decision  was  irrational  or  unlawful.   He
      referred to the guidance which stated:

           "The key thing to consider is if there is reliable  evidence  to
           support a  decision  that  the  person's  behaviour  calls  into
           question   their   character   and/or   conduct   and/or   their
           associations to the extent that it is undesirable to allow  them
           to enter or remain in the UK."



       He submitted that the Secretary of  State,  on  the  basis  of  sound
       reasoning and reliable  evidence,  had  found  that  the  Applicant's
       behaviour was such that  it  fell  within  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
       Immigration Rules as  it  called  into  question  his  character  and
       conduct and  that  she  had  been  fully  entitled  to  exercise  her
       discretion to refuse the Applicant's application for ILR.


  31.  If he was wrong about that, Mr Malik further submitted that, in  any
      event, judicial reviews should be refused pursuant to Section  31  of
      the  Senior  Courts  Act  1981  whereby  the  High  Court  (and,   by
      derivation,  this  Tribunal)  must  refuse  to  grant  relief  on  an
      application for judicial review "if it appears to  the  court  to  be
      highly likely that the outcome for the Applicant would not have  been
      substantially  different  if  the  conduct  complained  of  had   not
      occurred." In this regard, Mr Malik  submits  that  there  was  ample
      ground upon which the Secretary  of  State  could  have  called  into
      question the bona fides of the letter of 14 November  2016  from  the
      accountant.  Thus he  submitted  (at  paragraph  30  of  his  written
      submissions):

           "No details were provided as to this alleged IT "problem". It is
           not clear which software was being used  and  why  it  was  "not
           working properly".  The letter then seeks  to  blame  a  "former
           consultant" who "did not confirm the  figures  with  responsible
           person". The letter does not even name this former consultant or
           responsible person.  The letter then  suggests  that  there  was
           "just a clerical error plus software  issue".   This  is  simply
           incredible.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, to believe
           that a significant amount just disappeared from the figures  and
           no-one (including the Applicant) noticed until 15 July 2016.  It
           was on that date, it appears, when the accountants  amended  the
           accounts for the tax year 2011/12.  It is noteworthy that it was
           just five days before the Applicant  made  his  application  for
           indefinite leave to remain."



Discussion


  32.   The starting point seems to me to be that, where the  Secretary  of
      State discovers a significant difference between the  income  claimed
      in a previous application for leave to remain and the income declared
      to HMRC (as here), she is entitled to  draw  an  inference  that  the
      Applicant has been deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should  be
      refused  ILR  within  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
      However, it does not follow that, in all such cases,  a  decision  to
      refuse ILR will be lawful.  Where an Applicant has presented evidence
      to show that, despite the prima facie inference, he was not  in  fact
      dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of State is presented
      with a fact-finding  task  which  must  be  carried  out  fairly  and
      lawfully.  In that regard, she needs to remind herself that a finding
      that a person has been deceitful and dishonest in relation to his tax
      affairs with the consequence he is denied settlement in this  country
      is a very serious finding with serious consequences and therefore the
      evidence must be cogent and strong although, as the authorities show,
      the standard of proof remains on the balance of probabilities.


  33. It is further the case, in my judgment, that for an applicant  simply
      to blame his or her accountant for an  "error"  in  relation  to  the
      historical tax return will not be the end of the matter.   Thus,  the
      Secretary of State is entitled to take into account that  even  where
      an accountant has made an error, the accountant will or  should  have
      asked the taxpayer to confirm that the return  was  accurate  and  to
      have signed the tax return, and furthermore the Applicant  will  have
      known of his or her earnings  and  will  have  expected  to  pay  tax
      thereon.  Thus, in this case the Applicant did not pay tax of  almost
      �15,000 when he would have expected to do so  and  the  Secretary  of
      State is therefore entitled to ask why, put on  notice  in  this  way
      that something  was  wrong,  the  "mistake"  had  not  been  remedied
      earlier.


  34. Where an issue arises as to whether an error in  relation  to  a  tax
      return has been dishonest or merely careless, the Secretary of  State
      would be not merely entitled but obliged  to  consider  the  evidence
      pointing  in  each  direction  and,  in  her  decision,  justify  her
      conclusion by reference to that evidence. In those circumstances,  as
      long as the reasoning was rational and the evidence had been properly
      considered, the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  could  not  be
      impugned. In my judgment, the fifth proposition of law proposed by Mr
      Malik, although not contested by Mr Gajjar, in fact goes too far.  It
      is too broad or extreme a proposition to suggest that it cannot be  a
      defence for a person who has been refused ILR pursuant  to  paragraph
      322(5) on the basis of a discrepancy between his  tax  return  and  a
      previous application for leave to remain to say that  his  accountant
      or agent was responsible for the discrepancy on the basis  that  each
      person is personally responsible for his own tax matters and dealings
      with HMRC. Otherwise, whenever she discovers such a discrepancy,  the
      Secretary of State would be entitled to refuse  ILR  without  further
      consideration of the reason for the discrepancy  and  whether  it  in
      fact betrays a lack of honesty on the part of the  Applicant.   Thus,
      it seems to me that an error by an accountant may afford a reason for
      an Applicant to show that he has not been  dishonest  but,  at  most,
      careless (or perhaps even not that).  Thus, whilst it would  normally
      be the case that an Applicant would soon become aware  of  the  error
      because of his unexpected lack of a liability  to  pay  tax,  if  the
      Applicant could show that he was so distracted  by  other  matters  -
      here the serious illness of a  child  undergoing  life  saving  brain
      surgery with subsequent treatment, rehabilitation and chemotherapy  -
      then the Secretary of State would have  to  consider  very  carefully
      whether that did in fact afford a good  reason  for  the  Applicant's
      failure to appreciate that his tax liability was less  than  expected
      and therefore notify the authorities sooner than he had done so.  The
      Secretary of State would also need to put into the balance  the  kind
      of matters relied upon by Mr Malik at paragraph  30  of  his  written
      submissions referred to in paragraph 31 above deciding whether  there
      was or was not a genuine error on the  part  of  the  accountants  or
      whether this is simply an attempt to "pull the wool over  her  eyes".
      The Secretary of State would certainly be entitled to  be  suspicious
      of evidence blaming an accountant: as the  experience  of  the  UTIAC
      shows, illustrated by the cases relied upon by Mr Malik, this is  all
      too easily a way for an Applicant to  excuse  behaviour  which  calls
      into question their character or conduct within the guidance.   Thus,
      in my judgment the Tribunals in the previous cases have rightly  been
      sceptical as to whether an assertion that a discrepancy between a tax
      return and an application for leave to remain was simply attributable
      to an error on the part of the  accountant,  particularly  given  the
      safeguards which are known to exist whereby an Applicant should  have
      been asked to verify the information submitted to HMRC and to sign  a
      tax return.


  35. Applying the above to the decision in this case, although it seems to
      me that the Secretary of State could have lawfully  and  legitimately
      refused the Applicant's ILR on the basis of the material before her -
      and in this regard I note  that  there  was  no  statement  from  the
      Applicant fully setting out his case as to how it  came  about  there
      had been a false tax return submitted and I further note  that  there
      were aspects of the accountant's letter of  14  November  2016  which
      could have led the Secretary of State to  doubt  its  credibility  as
      submitted by Mr Malik - in my judgment the reasoning set out  in  the
      decision of 19 January 2017 and the Administrative Review of 2  March
      2017 shows that the Secretary of State  has  not  asked  herself  the
      correct questions or gone about her decision-making  process  in  the
      correct way.  Firstly, as Mr Gajjar submitted, there  is  nothing  in
      the decision of the Secretary of State to indicate that she  did  not
      accept that the letter of 14 November 2016 from  the  accountant  was
      wholly genuine and true.  Secondly, the important  paragraph  of  the
      decision letter starting with the words "Your amended tax returns  to
      HMRC are acknowledged and it [is] recognised you have a  revised  tax
      liability figure from HMRC.  However, it  is  considered  you  should
      have taken reasonable care to ensure your tax returns were  correctly
      submitted" (see paragraph 10 above) seems to rely upon the failure of
      the Applicant to exercise "reasonable care".   In  my  judgment  this
      betrays a lack of understanding on the part of the Secretary of State
      of the important difference between carelessness and  dishonesty  and
      the  need  rigorously  to  consider  whether  this  was  or  was  not
      dishonesty rather than carelessness.  Thirdly, the  decision  of  the
      Secretary of State wrongly states that it was only after being called
      to account  within  his  previous  refusal  that  the  Applicant  had
      reviewed and amended his returns.  He had in fact done so before  the
      previous refusal and although the Secretary of State could have asked
      herself why this had only been done five days before the  application
      and not significantly earlier, she did  not  do  so.   Fourthly,  the
      reversal of the burden  of  proof  in  the  final  sentence  of  that
      paragraph indicates that  the  Secretary  of  State  has  misdirected
      herself in relation to her fact-finding task in deciding whether  the
      Applicant had been dishonest or merely  careless.   In  my  judgment,
      this error is compounded in the Administrative Review of 2 March 2017
      where it is stated:

           "However, the original caseworker has not assessed your  current
           earnings in light of the concerns raised over the genuineness of
           previous earnings; you have also been  refused  under  paragraph
           322 (5) which is a refusal on the basis of  your  character  and
           conduct.  The  original  caseworker   has   not   refused   your
           application on the grounds of deception, therefore there  is  no
           burden of proof upon the Secretary of State in that regard."


       Whilst this may be a reference to the decision to discount any points
       for earnings in the application of 20  November  2016  and  therefore
       refuse ILR under 245CD(e) of the Immigration Rules, that seems to  me
       to ignore the fact that the basis for  ignoring  those  earnings  was
       that there had been the previous discrepancy between the  application
       for leave to remain in 2012 and the tax return for the year ending  5
       April  2012  and  the  doubt  arising  from  that  discrepancy.   The
       derivation of both the decision under paragraph 322(5) and  paragraph
       245CD (e) was or should have been a finding of deceit  or  dishonesty
       on the part of the Applicant in relation to the tax  return  for  the
       year ending 5 April 2012.


  36.  For the above reasons, I quash the decisions  of  the  Secretary  of
      State on the basis that they were not reached in  accordance  with  a
      proper and lawful approach to the fact-finding task which lay  before
      the Secretary of State in relation to this application.  Furthermore,
      I reject the submission that I should refuse judicial review pursuant
      to Section 31 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.  Although the  Secretary
      of State could have relied upon the various matters which,  Mr  Malik
      says, cast doubt on the bona fides of the  accountant's  letter,  all
      those matters and arguments were capable of being relied upon at  the
      time as they do not refer to any new evidence or matters  which  were
      not capable of being discerned by the decision  maker,  and  yet  the
      decision maker does not to do so.  It would go much too  far  for  me
      now to put myself in the shoes of the  decision  maker  and  conclude
      that it is highly  likely  that  the  decision  would  have  been  no
      different had the Secretary of State directed herself properly.  As I
      have said, to make a finding  of  dishonesty  with  the  consequences
      which ensued for this Applicant and  his  family  is  a  serious  and
      anxious finding which involves  very  careful  consideration  of  the
      evidence and arguments each way. The  evidence  and  arguments  would
      have to be much clearer and stronger than they are in this  case  for
      me to be able to reach that conclusion.


   Guidance


  37. In order not to  fall  into  the  trap  which  I  consider  that  the
      Secretary of State (or those acting on her behalf) fell into on  this
      occasion, it may assist for me to give some guidance in  relation  to
      the decision-making  process  where  there  have  been  discrepancies
      between previous  applications  for  Leave  to  Remain  (with  points
      claimed on the basis of earnings or profits) and  tax  returns  which
      have been made covering the same period.  This guidance stems from my
      observations at paragraphs 32-34 above:


           i) Where there has been a  significant  difference  between  the
              income claimed in a previous application for leave to  remain
              and the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary  of  State  is
              entitled to draw an inference that  the  Applicant  has  been
              deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused ILR
              within paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules.   I  would
              expect the Secretary of State to draw  that  inference  where
              there is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy.


          ii) However, where an Applicant has presented  evidence  to  show
              that, despite the prima facie inference, he was not  in  fact
              dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of  State  is
              presented with a fact-finding task: she must  decide  whether
              the explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her  view,  to
              displace the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.


         iii) In approaching that fact-finding task, the Secretary of State
              should remind herself that, although the standard of proof is
              the "balance of probability", a finding  that  a  person  has
              been deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs
              with the consequence that he is  denied  settlement  in  this
              country is a very serious finding with serious consequences.


          iv) However,  for  an  applicant  simply  to  blame  his  or  her
              accountant for an "error" in relation to the  historical  tax
              return will not be the end of the matter: far from it.  Thus,
              the Secretary of State is entitled to take into account that,
              even where an accountant has made an  error,  the  accountant
              will or should have asked the tax payer to confirm  that  the
              return was accurate and to have signed the  tax  return,  and
              furthermore the Applicant will  have  known  of  his  or  her
              earnings and will have expected  to  pay  tax  thereon.   If,
              realising  this  (or  wilfully  shutting  his  eyes  to   the
              situation), the  Applicant  has  not  taken  steps  within  a
              reasonable time to remedy the  situation,  the  Secretary  of
              State may be entitled to conclude either that the  error  was
              not simply the fault of the accountant or, alternatively, the
              Applicant's failure to remedy the situation itself  justifies
              a conclusion that he has been has been deceitful or dishonest
              and therefore he  should  be  refused  ILR  within  paragraph
              322(5) of the Immigration Rules.


           v) Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to a
              tax  return  has  been  dishonest  or  merely  careless,  the
              Secretary of  State  is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence
              pointing in each direction and, in her decision, justify  her
              conclusion  by  reference  to   that   evidence.   In   those
              circumstances, as long as the reasoning is rational  and  the
              evidence has been properly considered, the  decision  of  the
              Secretary of State cannot be impugned.


          vi) There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary of State
              to  consider  in  reaching  her  decision  in  these   cases,
              including (but these are by no means exclusive):


              i. Whether the explanation for the error by the accountant  is
                 plausible;


             ii. Whether the documentation which can  be  assumed  to  exist
                 (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and  his
                 accountant  at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                 disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for why it is
                 missing;


            iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an  error  had  been
                 made because his liability to pay  tax  was  less  than  he
                 should have expected;


             iv. Whether, at any stage, the Applicant  has  taken  steps  to
                 remedy the situation and, if  so,  when  those  steps  were
                 taken and the explanation for any significant delay.


         vii) In relation to any of the above  matters,  the  Secretary  of
              State is likely to want to see  evidence  which  goes  beyond
              mere assertion:  for example, in a case such as  the  present
              where the explanation is that the Applicant was distracted by
              his concern for his son's health, there should be documentary
              evidence about the matter.  If there is, then  the  Secretary
              of  State  would  need  to  weigh  up  whether  such  concern
              genuinely excuses or explains the failure to account for tax,
              or at least displaces the inference that  the  Applicant  has
              been deceitful/dishonest.  The  Secretary  of  State,  before
              making her decision, should call for the evidence  which  she
              considers ought  to  exist,  and  may  draw  an  unfavourable
              inference from any failure on the part of  the  Applicant  to
              produce it.


        viii) In her decision, the Secretary of State should articulate her
              reasoning, setting out the matters which she has  taken  into
              account in reaching her decision and stating the reasons  for
              the decision she has reached.
