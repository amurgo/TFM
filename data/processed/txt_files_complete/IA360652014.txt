For the Respondent:    Mr J Whitwell, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of India, date of birth 21 January,  appealed
    the decision of the Respondent, dated 2 September 2014,  in  which  she
    curtailed leave on the basis that the Appellant had not properly  taken
    an  English  language  TOEIC  test  and  as  a  result  served  removal
    directions upon  the  Appellant  and  upon  her  husband  and  son  and
    daughter.  The appeal came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Andonian
    who dismissed their appeals  on  4  February  2016  (promulgated  on  8
    February 2016).  Essentially, he found that the  Respondent  had  shown
    that there was a proper basis for the curtailment of leave because  the
    Appellant had not taken the test and that the cancellation of the  test
    had been satisfactorily demonstrated that she had  not  undertaken  the
    test.  Since that date of decision the case of SM and Qadir [2016] UKUT
    229 by the Upper Tribunal makes plain that notwithstanding the concerns
    about the extent of the generic evidence that had been provided to show
    that the test examinations were  likely  to  be  correct  in  terms  of
    revisiting the oral speech tapes showed that the Secretary of State had
    done enough to at least discharge the evidential burden that there  was
    a case to answer.  In this case I have been helpfully  provided  by  Mr
    Ren� with a copy of the  Appellant's  witness  statement  which,  as  I
    understand it, was in substance the evidence she gave  at  the  hearing
    and was not substantively enlarged upon as to her taking of  the  test.
    I note in passing it is not said that the judge  failed  to  recite  or
    address evidence that had been adduced by the Appellant concerning  the
    taking of the test.

2.   In the Appellant's statement, at paragraph 10, she said this:

         "... During my leave to remain in the UK the  new  Sponsor  college
         has been removed from the list again and a received another  letter
         of curtailment in February 2014 and the I applied again for further
         leave to remain in the UK on 27 March  2014  but  unfortunately  my
         application has been refused saying that a deception has been  used
         when I attend the English language test TOEIC but that is not true.
          As I sat for this exam and later on I also have provided  my  exam
         from City & Guild."

     The reference to City & Guild is to a later test taken in 2014  a  copy
    of which documents were provided to the judge and were referred  to  by
    him.

3.   The judge was also, I note in  passing,  provided  with  a  copy  of  a
    solicitor's letter from Igor  &  Co,  essentially  seeking  information
    concerning the ETS exercise, and he also had before him a reply sent by
    email, seemingly undated, but certainly in response to their letter  of
    30 August 2016.

4.    The  judge  set  out  carefully  matters  which  he  had  taken   into
    consideration in respect of the ETS and he simply did not  believe  the
    Appellant for reasons that he gave.  The Judge's decision needs  to  be
    read as a whole and I am mindful that it predates the decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal in Qadir.  Nevertheless the judge was  faced  with  what
    was an extremely brief  explanation  of  how  the  Appellant  says  she
    demonstrates she took the test took.  The Judge took the view  that  he
    did not believe her and he noted various matters about the  reliability
    of her evidence and so far as it arose her  credibility.   The  grounds
    set out a general challenge to  the  judge's  findings  but  I  do  not
    understand  those  grounds  to  essentially  indicate  that  there  was
    evidence  to  which  significant  weight  should  have  been  given  to
    demonstrate the Appellant took the test.  It is all too easily said, "I
    took the test" and that is then relied upon as evidence that  the  test
    was taken.  It seems to me that as Qadir indicates once  the  Secretary
    of State has discharged at least the evidential burden  that  there  is
    justification for the adverse ETS  decision  then  it  falls  upon  the
    Appellant to do more than simply say," it is wrong because I  took  the
    test" - which appears to have been the evidence before  the  judge.   I
    have scrutinised the Record of Proceedings and  do  not  find  anything
    further and I note that the grounds do not particularise matters raised
    in oral evidence at the hearing which the judge has failed to consider.

5.   I consider looking at it in the round, that the judge was  entitled  to
    reach the decision that he had.  He has  not  misapplied  the  law.   I
    agree with Mr Ren� that the history of the  Appellant's  activities  in
    education and the curtailment of leave and the taking of  colleges  off
    the register do not indicate in any direct sense that those affect  her
    credibility.  It would be a big  stretch  to  argue  that  because  she
    attended a series of colleges to which  that  happened,  the  inference
    should be drawn that she was not a genuine student.  Rather, the key to
    this is the evidence in relation to the ETS which  I  find  sufficient.
    In the absence of any reasonable explanation or evidence given  to  the
    judge, it seems inevitable that he reached the conclusion that he  did.
    It therefore followed that he found a proxy tester was used  and  there
    was the necessary element of dishonesty involved in the taking  of  the
    test.  Those are matters for the judge and I can find no good reason to
    interfere with his decision.  In any event it is not for me, even if  I
    disagreed with his decision, on which I make no comment,  to  interfere
    with the decision because I might have reached a different one.

6.   Accordingly the Original  Tribunal's  decision  stands.   The  Original
    Tribunal made no material error of law.  The appeal is dismissed.
