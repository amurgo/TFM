For the Appellant: Miss Rutherford instructed by Dicksons Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr Lister - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination of a panel of the  First-
        tier Tribunal composed of First-tier Tribunal Judge Sommerville and
        Mr H G Jones (hereinafter referred to as 'the Panel' who  dismissed
        the Appellant's appeal against a decision to deport him  to  Italy.
        AO is an Italian national.


     2. The Panel accepted AO resided in the UK lawfully  for  five  years,
        between 1994 and 1999 [17], but that he had failed to discharge the
        burden upon him to prove he has been lawfully resident  in  the  UK
        for the ten years between 1989 and 1999 [18].


     3. As a result of the conclusion AO has only  established  five  years
        lawful residence, and so acquired a right of  permanent  residence,
        the Panel assessed the merits of the appeal by reference to whether
        there are serious grounds of public  policy,  security,  or  health
        pursuant to  Regulation  21(3)  of  the  EEA  Regulation  2006  (as
        amended) warranting his deportation.



Discussion



     4. The key challenge to the determination is  that  in  proceeding  to
        apply the 'serious ground' test the Panel legally erred as this  is
        the wrong test. It has not been found that AO left  the  UK  for  a
        period of two years, or at all, such as to mean he lost  his  right
        of permanent residence, and so the Panel must have  been  satisfied
        that he has remained in the UK since entering in 1989. The right of
        permanent residence acquired would  only  be  lost,  under  Article
        16(4), if the Union citizen concerned  was  absent  from  the  host
        state for a period of two years. He has  been  in  the  country  in
        excess of ten years.


     5. The Panel found he had not established ten years lawful  residence.
        In McCarthy v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 641 the  Court  of  Appeal  said
        that lawful residence referred to in Article 16  of  the  Citizen's
        Directive was residence which complied with Community Law  and  the
        requirements of the Directive. In this case AO has lived in the  UK
        with a right of permanent residence and so it is  arguable  he  has
        lived lawfully and  in  accordance  with  Community  Law  for  that
        period.


     6. Mr Lister sought to rely upon the non binding opinion:  Opinion  of
        Advocate-General Bot: PI v Oberbï¿½rgermeisterin der Stadt  Remscheid
        (Case C-348/09). In this case Advocate-General Bot considered  that
        the Appellant's conduct - rape of a minor - and the  way  in  which
        the acts were committed showed that the true position was  that  he
        was not actually integrated and could not, therefore, benefit  from
        the enhanced protection. The Citizens Directive contained a  simple
        presumption of integration, which was rebutted in the present  case
        by the acts committed. Although the integration of a Union  citizen
        was, in fact, based on territorial and time factors,  it  was  also
        based on qualitative elements.


     7. The submission the nature of the offences committed by AO  put  his
        case at the same level as that considered by  the  Advocate-General
        is not made out on the facts.


     8. AO has served periods of imprisonment but in Secretary of State for
        the Home Department v FV (Italy) [2012] EWCA Civ 1199 it  was  held
        that the continuity of residence  for  the  purpose  of  regulation
        21(4)(a) was not broken by a period of  imprisonment:  Jarusevicius
        (EEA Reg 21  -  effect  of  imprisonment)  [2012]  UKUT  120  (IAC)
        approved.  The question whether the  requirement  of  a  continuous
        period of ten years' residence was established at the date  of  the
        decision to deport turned on the degree of integration  established
        at that time.  That was  a  question  of  fact  for  the  Tribunal.
        Periods of absence during the ten years immediately  preceding  the
        decision did not, of  themselves,  disqualify  and  neither  did  a
        period of imprisonment.  The period of imprisonment  was,  however,
        relevant  as  a  factor  to  be  considered  when   deciding   upon
        integration  at  the  date  of  decision.   Integration  would  not
        normally be established by the time spent in prison  save  that  it
        might have limited relevance by contributing to  the  severance  of
        links  with  the  country  of  origin.   If  integration  had  been
        established prior to the custodial term, it would  not  necessarily
        be lost by that term.   The  decision  would  turn  on  an  overall
        qualitative assessment  having  regard  to  all  relevant  factors,
        including the length  of  residence,  family  connections  and  any
        interruptions in integration. (Per Aikens and Rafferty LJJ) The key
        questions for the Tribunal to ask when  considering  whether  there
        had been a period of ten years' residence prior to the decision  to
        deport were whether imprisonment involved either  the  transfer  to
        another State of the centre of the personal, family or occupational
        interests of the person concerned, and/or whether the  "integrating
        links" previously forged  with  the  host  Member  State  had  been
        broken: Tsakouridis followed.


     9. I find it arguable the Panel erred in their assessment  of  whether
        AO has not resided in the UK for a continuous period of ten  years,
        such as to deny him the protection of the enhanced rights, for  the
        reasons stated. The appeal will have to be considered  further  and
        the issue of whether AO has ten  years  continuous  residence,  and
        whether such integration has been lost or not  through  periods  of
        imprisonment, investigated and appropriate findings made. If it  is
        found AO has ten years qualifying residence the Tribunal will  have
        to consider whether the higher 'imperative' test is  satisfied  and
        conduct an assessment of the remaining elements of the Regulations,
        if required.


    10. I set the determination aside.  As there has been no examination of
        all relevant issues by the First-tier Tribunal it  was  agreed  the
        appeal  must  be  remitted  to  be  heard  afresh.   The  following
        directions shall apply to the future conduct of the appeal:


              i.       The  appeal  shall  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal sitting at                       Sheldon Court Birmingham to  be
   heard by a Designated  or                       salaried  judge  of  that
   tribunal with sufficient knowledge of EU                    law on a date
   nominated by Resident Judge Renton in  light                      of  the
   current    operational    requirements    of     the     centre.     Time
   estimate 3 hours.


              ii.          The parties shall file with the Tribunal and sent
   to the opposing                       party a consolidated, indexed,  and
   paginated bundle containing                   all the evidence upon which
   they intend to rely no later than 7                     days  before  the
   hearing. Skeleton arguments must be                          included  in
   the    bundles.    Witness    statements    shall    stand     as     the
   evidence  in  chief   of   the   maker.   Those   responsible   for   the
      preparation  of  the  bundles  must  note  the  adverse  comments   to
      be  found  in   paragraph   10   of   the   First-tier   determination
      regarding  the  poor  quality  of  the  evidence  produced   to   date
     and  ensure  that  all  available  relevant  evidence  is  included  in
          the bundle.


              iii.         An Italian interpreter is required


Decision

    11. The First-tier Tribunal Panel materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the original Panel.  The appeal shall  be  remitted
        to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  the  decision  to  be  remade  in
        accordance with the directions given above.


   Anonymity.


    12. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  I
        continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
