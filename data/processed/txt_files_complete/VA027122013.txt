                              MISS AMINA BEGUM

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                       ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER - DHAKA

                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1.   The Respondent  has been granted permission to appeal to the Upper
       Tribunal against a decision of  Immigration  Judge  Callender  Smith
       who, by a determination promulgated on 10th September 2013,  allowed
       the  Appellant's  appeal  brought  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       against the refusal  to  grant  her  entry  clearance  as  a  family
       visitor.


    2.   At the commencement of the hearing the Respondent's representative
       informed me that the Entry Clearance Officer  had  now  granted  the
       Appellant a visa  as  a  visitor  and  indeed  she  is  in  the  UK.
       Accordingly the Entry Clearance Officer wishes to withdraw his  case
       before the  Upper  Tribunal.   He  needs  permission  to  do  so  in
       accordance with  Paragraph  17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
       Tribunal) Rules 2008 which I give.

    3.       For these reasons,  without  considering  the  merits  of  the
       grounds upon the basis of which permission to appeal was granted the
       appeal before the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.


                               Signed:






                               Judge of the Upper Tribunal


                               Date: 26th November 2013
