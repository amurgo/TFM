Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr P Richardson, Counsel instructed by Paul John &
Co solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are nationals of India and  are  a  family.   The  first
    Appellant was born on 11 March  1983  and  is  married  to  the  second
    Appellant who was born on 19  November  1974.   The  third  and  fourth
    Appellants are their sons, born respectively on 6 September 2002 and 11
    July 2000.

 2. They entered the UK together on 30 September 2008 with visit visas.   A
    subsequent application was made on 24 March 2009 for  leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules but  these  applications  were  refused  and  despite
    reconsideration the decisions were maintained on 18 August 2010.  On 10
    December 2012, EEA residence card  applications  were  made  but  these
    applications were also refused on 8 January 2014.  On 28 February 2017,
    the Appellants submitted private life applications, which were  refused
    in decisions taken on 24 May 2018.

 3. The Appellants appealed against this decision on human rights  grounds.
    Their appeals came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Pooler  for
    hearing on 8 January 2019.  In a decision and reasons promulgated on 23
    January 2019, the judge dismissed the appeal.  He noted that the second
    Appellant had a conviction for possession of a false identity  document
    in respect of which he had been sentenced to six  months'  imprisonment
    and had failed to disclose this.  Thus he did not meet the requirements
    of paragraph S-LTR 1.6 and 2.2(b) and that the first Appellant  had  an
    outstanding NHS debt of ï¿½862 and thus did not qualify pursuant to S-LTR
    4.5 of Appendix FM of the Rules.

 4. The issue before  the  judge  was  essentially  the  reasonableness  in
    expecting the third and fourth Appellants to leave  the  UK  given  the
    length of residence.  Also  at  [13]  the  judge  held  as  follows  in
    relation to the fourth Appellant:

         "I find, however, that he was unable to meet  the  requirements  of
         sub-paragraph (v) because of the requirement in the Rules that  his
         circumstances must be considered at the date of application.  On 28
         February 2017 he was below the age of 18  and  so  could  not  fall
         within paragraph 276ADE(1)(v)."

    This refers to the fact that the fourth Appellant was 17 at the date of
    application but was 18 at the date of hearing and thus qualified  under
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(v) of the Rules.

 5. The judge proceeded  to  dismiss  the  appeals,  finding  that  it  was
    reasonable to expect the third and fourth Appellants  to  follow  their
    parents to India.

 6. Permission to appeal was sought in time on the basis of  the  following
    grounds.  Firstly that the judge had materially  erred  in  failing  to
    follow the relevant guidance at [18],  [20]  and  [22].   The  guidance
    referred  to  being  not  only  the  Home  Office  guidance   but   the
    jurisprudence including MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 at  [46].

 7. It was further submitted at ground 2, that  the  judge  had  failed  to
    consider all the relevant factors.  In particular, the fourth Appellant
    is now 18 years of age and had lived in the UK for over  ten  years  at
    the date of hearing and at that time qualified  pursuant  to  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(v) of the Rules.  It  was  submitted  that  this  is  a  very
    significant factor which the judge should have considered in  terms  of
    the reasonableness of expecting him to leave the UK.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew in
    a decision dated 12 February 2019 on the following basis:

         "I am satisfied there are arguable errors of law in  this  decision
         in that the Judge has not taken full note of the case law  guidance
         in relation to a child who has been in the UK for over seven  years
         and who is  about  to  take  GCSE  examinations.   Further,  it  is
         arguable that when coming to his conclusions the Judge did not give
         any weight to the fact that the older child had been in the UK  for
         over half his life.  Had he done so he may have come to a different
         conclusion as to the appeal of the children's parents."

    Hearing

 9. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, Mr Richardson  on  behalf  of
    the Appellants adopted the grounds of appeal  in  their  entirety.   He
    helpfully set out the immigration history and the  relevant  dates  and
    submitted that the issue was the length of residence of  the  children.
    Mr Richardson also acknowledged  that  neither  the  first  nor  second
    Appellant could qualify under the Rules due to their inability to  meet
    the suitability requirements  and  that  following  the  Supreme  Court
    judgment in KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53, this does count against  them.



10. Mr Richardson submitted that at the date  of  the  applications  on  28
    February 2017 both the third and fourth Appellants were minors and were
    both considered at the date of decision on 24 May  2018,  i.e.  fifteen
    months later, under paragraph 276ADE(iv), i.e. that  they  had  resided
    for more than seven years and it would be unreasonable to  expect  them
    to leave the UK.

11. However, by the time of the appeal hearing  before  Judge  Pooler,  the
    fourth Appellant had attained  his  majority  and  was  over  18.   The
    consequence of that was that at the date of the appeal hearing  he  had
    been in the UK for  more  than  half  his  life  and  had  he  made  an
    application under paragraph 276ADE(1)(v) of the Rules this  would  have
    succeeded.

12. At [13] of the decision, the judge correctly noted however that at  the
    date of application the fourth Appellant did not meet the  requirements
    of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(v)  of  the  Rules.   However,  Mr  Richardson
    submitted that where the judge  fell  into  error,  was  in  completely
    failing  to  factor  in  that  the  fourth  Appellant  was  capable  of
    satisfying  the  Rules  and  thus  this  was  clearly  material  to  an
    assessment of the proportionality of his removal pursuant to Article 8.



13. Mr Richardson further submitted that if it is  right  that  the  fourth
    Appellant succeeds under the Rules, that it  would  be  an  affront  to
    common  sense  that  the  third  Appellant  should  be   treated   less
    favourably.  Given that he was due to undertake his GCSEs it  would  be
    even harder for him to relocate and he has been in the UK for the  same
    length of time as his brother, i.e. he is now 16 and he arrived in  the
    UK at the age of 6.

14. In relation to the Supreme Court judgment in KO (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC
    53, he submitted that the fact that  one  of  the  family  members  was
    entitled to remain under the Rules is a "real world" factor and that KO
    (Nigeria) encourages decision makers to look  at  the  reality  of  the
    situation.  He submitted that this is a factor of some weight but there
    is no mention of this by the judge in his assessment of  reasonableness
    at [13].

15. In relation to the second ground of  appeal,  Mr  Richardson  submitted
    that we are dealing here with a child  who  is  now  an  adult,  having
    resided in the UK continuously for ten and a half years, and a 16-year-
    old who has been in education for the entirety  of  that  period.   The
    third and fourth Appellants cannot read or write in  Gujarati  and  the
    judge expressly found at [18] that it would be in their best  interests
    to remain in the UK.  However he found at [20] "I  see  no  reason  why
    they would be unable to learn that  skill  within  a  reasonably  short
    period" which Mr Richardson submitted was an unreasonable finding.

16. He submitted in terms of the best interests of  the  third  and  fourth
    Appellants that their case was very strong in terms of their ties  with
    the UK, albeit he accepted  that  the  real  world  factors,  i.e.  the
    parental conduct, were material.  Even with those  factors  they  could
    not reasonably be required to interrupt the education of the third  and
    fourth Appellants.

17. Mr Richardson handed up copies of the recent presidential  decision  in
    JG (s117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey  [2019]  UKUT  72  (IAC)
    where the Tribunal did consider the impact of  KO  (Nigeria)  and  real
    world factors at [84].   Mr  Richardson  reiterated  that  the  primary
    consideration is still the best interests of the children to remain  in
    the UK as found by the judge at [18] and their historic  jurisprudence,
    e.g. ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 and that there were  clearly  material
    errors in the judge's decision.

18. In his submissions, Mr Bramble sought to defend  the  judge's  decision
    stating that there was full  consideration  of  the  third  and  fourth
    Appellants at [16] to [22] of the decision; that the  judge  was  fully
    aware of their circumstances and had those at the front and  centre  of
    his considerations.  The judge accepted it would be unfortunate if  the
    third Appellant would have to leave before taking his GCSEs at [18] and
    was fully aware that they had been in the UK for more  than  ten  years
    and that their best interests lie in remaining in the UK.

19. Mr Bramble submitted that albeit he  did  not  refer  to  KO  (Nigeria)
    [2018] UKSC 53, the judge has applied it correctly; that there were two
    parents whose misconduct would not in their own right  enable  them  to
    have any right to remain in the UK and this was dealt with by the judge
    at [19].  He submitted the judge could not ignore the factual situation
    and it was open to him to find it was  reasonable  for  the  third  and
    fourth Appellants to return to India.

20. Mr Bramble did, however, accept that the fourth Appellant had become an
    adult by the date of hearing and was capable of satisfying  the  Rules.
    He also accepted that potentially there was an error in that the  judge
    did not take that factor into account in the proportionality  exercise.
    However Mr Bramble submitted that this was not material in the  context
    of the appeal, because the cases had always been argued  on  the  basis
    that the Appellants are a family unit and it was not indicated that the
    fourth Appellant wished to be treated as a separate independent person.
     Thus he submitted that this factor would not change the  determination
    and was not sufficient to tip the balance in light of the background of
    the parents, the NHS debt and the conviction.

21. In reply, Mr Richardson submitted that the  failure  by  the  judge  to
    factor in the half-life aspect of the case in relation  to  the  fourth
    Appellant was material in two ways.  Firstly, if a member of  a  family
    has  a  right  to  remain  under  the  Rules  this   impacts   on   the
    reasonableness of  relocation  of  his  sibling  and  this  is  key  to
    determining whether or not his parents stay.  The second reason is that
    the Rules are set by the Secretary of State as to where his obligations
    lie in terms of Article 8 and if an individual satisfies the Rules then
    it follows that it is unlikely that removal would be proportionate  and
    this impacts on the appeals of the family as a whole.

    Findings and Reasons - error of law

22. I found a material error of law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge and announced my decision at the hearing.  I  found  the
    second ground of appeal in particular has merit  in  that  clearly  the
    fact that the fourth Appellant qualified under  paragraph  276ADE(1)(v)
    of  the  Rules  was  a  material   consideration   in   assessing   the
    proportionality of the Appellants' Article 8 case as a whole.  However,
    I also found that the Judge's impugned findings at [18], [20] and  [22]
    in respect of the reasonableness of  expecting  the  third  and  fourth
    Appellants to leave the UK were flawed due to the failure by the  Judge
    to consider the Home Office guidance in force  at  that  time  and  the
    judgment of Lord Justice Elias in MA (Pakistan) [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705,
    bearing in mind the  recent  judgment  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  JG
    (s117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey [2019] UKUT 72 (IAC).

    Submissions on the substantive appeal

23. I invited the parties to address me as to next steps and  both  parties
    agreed that there were sufficient findings for the Upper Tribunal to re-
    determine the appeal.

24. I then heard submissions from Mr Bramble on behalf of the Secretary  of
    State, who submitted in line with his earlier  submissions  as  to  the
    error of law aspect that the question is  whether  the  fact  that  the
    fourth Appellant meets the requirements of the Rules makes  a  material
    difference. Whilst he has turned 18, the extant appeals related to  the
    family unit as a  whole.  Mr  Bramble  submitted  that  if  the  fourth
    Appellant wished to remain in the UK, it was open to  him  to  make  an
    application on his own and queried why the first two Appellants  should
    benefit in light of their poor immigration history. He  submitted  that
    this does not necessarily impact on  the  circumstances  of  the  third
    Appellant and that they still stand and it was reasonable to expect the
    third Appellant to return to India with his parents.

25. In his submissions, Mr Richardson fairly accepted that  the  third  and
    fourth  Appellants  are  the  only  Appellants  who  are   capable   of
    succeeding.  He reminded me that as this is a human rights  appeal  the
    relevant decision is today's date.  However that regard should  be  had
    for the purposes of Article 8 to paragraph 276ADE(1)(v) in relation  to
    the fourth Appellant, albeit the appeal could not be allowed under  the
    Rules and the fourth Appellant has not, as yet, made an application for
    leave to remain in his own right.  Mr Richardson  also  submitted  that
    the parents, the first two Appellants, can  only  succeed  outside  the
    Rules and therefore the position was today  that  there  was  only  one
    qualifying child, the third Appellant, and that Section 117B(6) of  the
    NIAA 2002 applied  in  relation  to  assessing  the  reasonableness  of
    expecting him to relocate to India.

26. In relation to the fourth Appellant, Mr Richardson submitted  that  his
    ability to meet the Rules is determinative of his  appeal  outside  the
    Rules (cf. TZ (Pakistan)[2018] EWCA Civ 1109 at [34]

27. The fourth Appellant is now an adult, he has been in the UK for ten and
    a half years since the age of 8, all his formative years and almost all
    of his education has been in the UK and it is his intention to continue
    his education  or  undertake  an  apprenticeship.   He  is  an  English
    speaker, whilst he can speak Gujarati he cannot read or  write  it,  as
    the judge accepted at [20] of his decision.

28. In relation to the third Appellant, he is now in the final year of  his
    GCSE studies, having resided in the UK since the  age  of  6.   He  has
    grown up in this country and this is key to determining his appeal.  At
    [18] the judge found he would not suffer harm if he were to  leave  the
    UK,  but  rather  disruption.    Mr   Richardson   submitted   it   was
    overwhelmingly contrary to his best interests for him to have to  leave
    the UK and his best interests have to be assessed  in  the  real  world
    (cf. JG (Turkey) op.  cit.  at  [27]).   Mr  Richardson  accepted  that
    parental conduct is relevant to the assessment  of  reasonableness  and
    even if this produced unsatisfactory results, as was acknowledged in GJ
    at [41], this is the effect of the Rules that have been put in place by
    the Secretary of State.

29. I reserved my decision, which I now give with my reasons.

    Findings and reasons - substantive appeal

30. I proceed to determine the appeal on the basis that there is no dispute
    of fact: the family have  resided  continuously  in  the  UK  since  30
    September 2008; neither the first nor the second Appellant can meet the
    suitability requirements of the Rules; the third Appellant was  aged  6
    when he arrived in the UK and is now 16 and undergoing  his  GCSEs  and
    the fourth Appellant was 8 when he arrived and is now 18. He  would  be
    eligible for leave to remain pursuant to paragraph 276ADE(1)(v) of  the
    Rules if he were to make an application, because he is 18 and has spent
    more than half his life in the UK.

31. Mr Bramble submitted  that  the  fourth  Appellant  should  be  treated
    independently, due to the fact that he is now an adult. I do not accept
    that  submission.  The  higher  Courts  have  made  clear  on  numerous
    occasions that there is no "bright line" in respect of young adults cf.
    Lord Justice Maurice Kaye in KA (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1014 at [18].  He  still  lives  as
    part of the family unit and I consider that  he  remains  part  of  the
    family. Thus I proceed on the basis that the fact that he  is  eligible
    for the grant of leave to remain under the Rules is a  factor  relevant
    to the proportionality of removal.

32. The third Appellant's case is based on paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the
    Rules. There is no  dispute  that  he  is  under  18  and  has  resided
    continuously in the UK for at least  7  years,  thus  the  question  if
    whether it would be reasonable to expect him to leave the UK.  This  is
    the same test as that contained in the statutory public  considerations
    set out in section 117B(6)(b) of the NIAA 2002.  There  is  no  dispute
    that the third Appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
    his parents. Moreover, in light of the finding of the former  President
    in Treebhawon and Others (NIAA 2002 Part 5A - compelling  circumstances
    test) [2017] UKUT 00013 (IAC) at [20]-[21] if the conditions set out in
    section 117B(6) are met, the  public  interest  does  not  require  the
    removal of the parent(s) from  the  UK  and  consequently,  the  public
    interests identified in section 117B (1) - (3) do not apply.

33. I find in light of the judgment in JG (s117B(6): "reasonable to  leave"
    UK) Turkey [2019] UKUT 72 (IAC) that it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect the third Appellant to leave the UK.  He  has  resided  in  this
    country continuously for more than 10  years;  all  his  education  has
    taken place here and he is currently studying for his GCSEs exams.  The
    Presidential panel held inter alia as follows:

         "8.  In October 2018, the Supreme Court gave judgment in KO
         (Nigeria) & Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018]
         UKSC 53. The Court's judgment was given by Lord Carnwath.


         9.   The first thing to note is that there is nothing in the
         judgment that overturns the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in MA
         (Pakistan) regarding the free-standing nature of section 117B(6),
         in the sense that where the application of that provision results
         in the public interest not requiring the removal of the person
         concerned, he or she must succeed under Article 8 on the basis that
         the proportionality balance contains nothing on the Secretary of
         State's side of the scales. The words "the public interest does not
         require the person's removal" mean what they say ...


         27.  We do not consider that paragraphs 18 and 19 of KO
         (Nigeria) mandate or even lend support to the respondent's
         interpretation. In those paragraphs, the point being made by Lord
         Carnwath and by the judges in the cases he cited is merely that, in
         determining whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to
         leave the United Kingdom, one must have regard to the fact that one
         or both of the child's parents will no longer be in the United
         Kingdom, because they will have been removed by the respondent
         under immigration powers. That, we find, is the extent of the "real
         world" envisaged by Lord Carnwath ...


         40.  ... If, as we have found, Parliament has decreed a particular
         outcome by enacting section 117B(6), then that is the end of the
         matter.


         41.  We accept that this interpretation may result in an
         underserving individual or family remaining in the United Kingdom.
         However, the fact that Parliament has mandated such an outcome
         merely means that, in such cases, Parliament has decided to be more
         generous than is strictly required by the Human Rights Act 1998. It
         can be regarded as a necessary consequence of the aim of Part 5A of
         imposing greater consistency in decision-making in this area by
         courts and tribunals. The fact that section 117B(6) has such an aim
         was expressly recognised by Elias LJ at paragraph 44 of MA
         (Pakistan) ...


34. I have no hesitation in finding that it would  not  be  reasonable  for
    either the third or the fourth Appellant to leave the UK  and  that  it
    would be entirely contrary to the  third  Appellant's  best  interests,
    given the stage he has reached  in  his  education,  coupled  with  his
    continuous residence for over 10  years.  I  accept  in  light  of  the
    findings of  the  First  tier  Tribunal,  that  the  third  and  fourth
    Appellants are fluent English speakers.

35. In respect of the parents, the first and second Appellants, I note that
    in JG, which has  some  similarities  to  the  extant  appeal,  it  was
    determined on the following bases:

         "80. Our assessment of the appellant is that she is both dishonest
         and unscrupulous, each to a high degree. She has flagrantly defied
         the law of the United Kingdom by overstaying her leave for a large
         number of years, without bothering to seek to regularise her
         status; by making entry clearance applications that she knew full
         well were predicated on an entirely false basis; and in gaining
         access to the United Kingdom by employing dishonesty...


         84.  Applying the "real world" analysis of paragraphs 18 and 19
         of KO (Nigeria), the assessment of whether it would be reasonable
         in terms of section 117B(6) to expect the children of the appellant
         and her partner to leave the United Kingdom falls to be determined
         on the basis that there are powerful reasons why the appellant
         should be removed by the respondent under section 10 of the
         Immigration and Asylum Act 1999."


36.  I find that similarly, given  the  second  Appellant's  conviction  and
    sentence of 6 months imprisonment for possession of  a  false  identity
    document there are powerful reasons why he should be removed.  Further,
    the first Appellant is also unable to meet the suitability requirements
    at S-LTR 4.5.  due  to  an  outstanding  NHS  debt  of  ï¿½862.  However,
    following JG I am required to determine section 117B(6) on the basis of
    whether it is reasonable to expect the child to follow the parent  with
    no right to remain to the country of origin. Given that I  have  found,
    for the reasons set out at [34] above that it would not  be  reasonable
    to expect the third Appellant to leave, the appeals of his parents also
    succeed on the basis of section 117B(6) of the NIAA 2002.

37.  I allow the fourth Appellant's appeal on the  basis  that  his  removal
    would be a disproportionate interference with his  private  and  family
    life, given that, albeit no application has been made to  date,  if  he
    made  an  application  for  leave  to  remain   pursuant   to   section
    276(ADE)(1)(v) of the  Rules,  that  application  would  be  likely  to
    succeed and thus the judgment in TZ (Pakistan)[2018] EWCA Civ  1109  at
    [34] is applicable.

38.  I allow the appeal  of  the  third  Appellant  on  the  basis  that  he
    qualifies under paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) of the Rules and  in  light  of
    the judgment in TZ (Pakistan)[2018] EWCA Civ 1109  at  [34]  where  the
    Rules are satisfied that is positively determinative of the appeal.

39.  I allow the appeals of the first two  Appellants  pursuant  to  section
    117B(6) of the NIAA 2002, in light of my finding that it would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the third Appellant to leave the UK .



Notice of Decision

The decision of First tier Tribunal Judge Pooler contained  material  errors
of law. I set that decision aside and re-make it, allowing  the  appeals  on
human rights grounds (Article 8).

No anonymity direction is made.
