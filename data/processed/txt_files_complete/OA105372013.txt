Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent/Claimant: No Legal Representative but Sponsor attends.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The claimant in this case is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 24th  April
    1980.  She applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom as the  spouse
    of the sponsor in  an  application  dated  24th  December  2012.   That
    application was refused by a decision dated 20th March 2013 and  upheld
    by the Entry Clearance Manager on 29th October 2013.

2.   The claimant sought to appeal against that decision, which appeal  came
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Shamash on 19th May 2014.  The  appeal
    was allowed both in respect of the Immigration Rules and in respect  of
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

3.   The Entry Clearance Officer sought to appeal against that  decision  on
    the basis that the documentation submitted by the appellant in  support
    of the maintenance requirements did not meet  the  specific  Rules  and
    also that the guidance in Gulshan was not applied in respect of Article
    8.

4.   Permission to appeal was granted and thus the  matter  came  before  me
    for determination.

5.   The sponsor was unrepresented at the hearing.

6.   In many ways this is an unfortunate situation because,  as  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge indicated in the  determination,  there  is  little
    challenge to the fact that the sponsor was earning the requisite  funds
    at the time of the application and  subsequently.   Numerous  documents
    were produced showing the finances of the sponsor.

7.   The difficulty facing the sponsor was that, as clearly set out  in  the
    decision letter of 20th March 2013,  namely  that  the  format  of  the
    letters from his employers did not meet the requirements as set out  in
    paragraph 2(b) of FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.

8.   Such Rules require the sponsor to provide a letter  from  the  employer
    or employers to issue the wage slips at paragraph 2(a) confirming:-

    (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;


    (ii) the length of their employment;


    (iii)    the period over which they have been or were paid the level of
         salary relied upon in the application; and


    (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed term contract or agency).

9.   There was a letter from Shell Cluster confirming that the  sponsor  was
    employed since April 2011 but did not confirm  whether  this  is  on  a
    permanent basis.  The letter did not confirm his gross income  or  when
    he had started being paid at that rate.

10.  Similarly there was a letter from Churchill Services to the  fact  that
    the sponsor had been employed since 2011.   That letter only stated the
    number of hours he worked and the hourly rate.  The  employer  had  not
    confirmed when this rate of income started or the gross annual income.

11.  It was because of these defects that the application had been refused.

12.   It  seems  to  me  that  the  Judge,  although  noting  the  concerns,
    nevertheless took the  view  that  there  had  been  at  no  stage  any
    assertion that the sponsor did not earn over �18,600 in the  period  of
    time prior to the application nor that he failed to meet the  financial
    requirements.  The Judge was satisfied from all the letters,  P60s  and
    wage slips produced that that income was in place at the  time  of  the
    application and remains so to the present day.  Undoubtedly  the  Judge
    was right to take that view  but,  as  Mr  Avery,  who  represents  the
    respondent, pointed out, there has to be the evidence presented in  the
    way as outlined under the Immigration Rules.

13.  The fairness of the financial requirement  and  the  way  in  which  it
    should be established was considered by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MM
    (Lebanon) & Ors [2014] EWCA Civ 985.

14.  It seems to me that that challenge is one that is  meritorious  in  the
    sense that, if the Regulations made under statute require evidence in a
    particular form, then it should be provided in that form.

15.  As I indicated to the sponsor that should not have proved  a  difficult
    obstacle in any event.

16.  He is still with Shell Cluster and with Churchill Services.

17.  There should be little difficulty, it would  seem  to  me,  in  letters
    from those  employers  being  prepared  in  the  correct  form  setting
    out,particularly in relation to the date of application that  prior  to
    that application he had earned with them a particular sum, setting  out
    his earnings since April 2011  and  in  particular  within  the  twelve
    months immediately preceding the application. Each letter can  set  out
    the length of his employment and the nature of employment and how  much
    he has been paid.  That is all mirrored to some extent in the  payslips
    and P60s that have been presented but that is not good enough  to  meet
    the Rules.

18.  It would also be helpful in this  case  for  those  employers  also  to
    confirm what the sponsor has been earning since the application and  to
    date, once again setting that out in terms of a gross annual salary and
    whether he is on a permanent or fixed term contract or agency.

19.  Challenge is also made to the  approach  taken  to  Article  8  by  the
    Judge.  Once again I have considerable sympathy with the way  in  which
    the Judge was seeking to approach the  matter.  However,  it  has  been
    stressed by the senior courts that Article 8  should  not  be  used  to
    circumvent the otherwise  demanding  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Therefore the fact that someone meets the spirit  of  the  Rules
    does not necessarily, without more, led to a successful application  of
    Article 8 ECHR.

20.  The approach taken in Gulshan and  in  Nagre  ,whilst  to  some  extent
    criticised by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MM,  offers   much  judicial
    discussion as to the precise ambit and operation  of  Article  8,  when
    viewed through the prism  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Generally  the
    approach to be taken, if the claimant  did  not  meet  the  Immigration
    Rules, would be to look  to  see  if  there  was  something  compelling
    outside of those Rules,  which  would  render  non-admission  into  the
    United Kingdom unduly harsh.

21.  It is entirely apparent from paragraph 29  of  the  determination  that
    the Judge had such matters  generally  in  mind  but  perhaps  did  not
    express them in the way that they should possibly be expressed.

22.  As indeed the sponsor was at pains to make clear to  me  he  earns  now
    some �26,000 a year, well over the minimum  that  is  required  by  the
    Rules..  He has adequate accommodation as indeed was found by the Judge
    and not challenged.  He now  has  a  small  child  and  it  is  clearly
    important to him and to his family  that  they  come  together  without
    delay.  The Judge noted  that  the  process  of  appeal  has  taken  an
    inordinate length of time to be resolved.

23.   There  is  a  paucity  of  information  as  to   the   situation   and
    circumstances of the claimant and of her child in Sri Lanka.  No  doubt
    that could be addressed by further evidence.  It seems to me,  however,
    that the challenge which was made by the Entry Clearance Officer to the
    approach to Article 8 has some merit though perhaps not  quite  in  the
    terms as relied upon in the written grounds.

24.  In the circumstances therefore and with some  reluctance  I  set  aside
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge for the  decision  to  be
    remade.

25.  Having regard to the reality of further evidence  and  of  findings  of
    fact to be made, I direct , in line with  paragraph  7  of  the  Senior
    President's Practice Direction, that   the  matter  should  be  reheard
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

26.  I indicated  to  the  sponsor  that  he  should  address  the  concerns
    expressed in the refusal letter with particularity and  to  obtain  the
    necessary statements from his employers as required by  the  Rules.   I
    also suggested to him that it might be prudent  to get further evidence
    about his child and the circumstances  of  the  claimant  and  why  the
    claimant would say that it was unduly harsh that  they  remain  in  Sri
    Lanka rather than coming to the United Kingdom.

27.  So far as the Immigration Rules are concerned there was a finding  that
    the sponsor satisfied the Rules as to accommodation.  No challenge  has
    been made to that and in those circumstances that  is  a  finding  that
    should remain.

28.  Given the delay in this matter it was with some relief  that  an  early
    date for a hearing has been established, namely  26th  September  2014.
    The sponsor should therefore seek to address the evidential concerns as
    speedily as he is able.
