                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal from the determination of  Mr  Rush  sitting  as  an
      Adjudicator on 31 July 2003.

2.    The claimant is a 50 year old citizen of  Peru.   He  arrived  in  the
      United Kingdom 21 July 2002 with a visitor's visa  which  was  due  to
      expire in Mid-January 2003.   A month after  its  expiry  he  made  an
      application for asylum.

3.    The asylum claim was based on the fact that the claimant says that  he
      is and has always been a supporter of the party  of  former  President
      Fujmori in Peru, a  Party  known  as  Cambio  90.   He  said  that  he
      distributed leaflets and attended many  rallies  in  support  of  that
      party.    During the second part of 2000 the popularity of  the  party
      plummeted and President Fujimori fell from office,  fled  the  country
      and has sought refuge in Japan from which state he is unlikely ever to
      be extradited.

4.    The party of President Fujimori however does still remain,  and  as  a
      result of the recent elections in Peru, which were generally  held  as
      being free and fair, there is some representation of that party in the
      Peruvian Parliament.  We return to the facts of the claimant's case as
      he asserted them to be.

5.    On 17 November 2000 he was summoned to police head quarters in  Callao
      for questioning.    He was detained for 5 days  and  questioned  about
      his political activities with Cambio 90 and his support for  President
      Fujimori. His family then intervened and on  26  November  or  perhaps
      another date a few days after his detention he was  released.    There
      is no claim made in his  statement  that  he  was  mistreated  by  the
      authorities.  He then, according to him,  received  various  telephone
      calls from security agents who called him a traitor for his support of
      Fujimori.    Then on 3 December 2000 he was  attacked  by  people  who
      attempted to abduct him.   They tried to push him into the back  of  a
      car.    He was slapped and cut by his abductors and he was  told  that
      he was finished and he was going to be  executed.     He  was  finally
      saved by neighbours who ran out of their homes hearing the noise.   He
      was taken to hospital for his wounds to be treated and there  security
      agents came for him as well but were unable to harm  him.     He  said
      that he then left hospital early on 6  December  2000  and  went  into
      hiding at his uncle's house.  He no longer felt safe in Peru and so on
      5 January 2001 he stowed away in a boat to Panama  where  he  remained
      until he made the journey to the United Kingdom.

6.    We have given the account  of  the  claimant  as  he  put  it  himself
      because we consider that there is substance of the  criticism  of  the
      Adjudicator's determination in the  grounds  of  appeal.     The  Vice
      President who granted leave himself said that  it  was  arguable  that
      clearer reasons should have been given  for  what  in  fact  a  robust
      rejection of the claimant's credibility.  We do not consider that  the
      Adjudicator has sufficiently reasoned his rejection of the  claimant's
      credibility.  Therefore for the purposes of this appeal we will  treat
      the claimant's account as being a truthful account of  what  happened.
       For us to do otherwise would mean the  inevitable  remittal  of  this
      matter to another Adjudicator for it to be reheard.

7.    We have come unhesitatingly to the view that even if every  word  that
      the claimant said and that we have set out above is true he is  at  no
      real risk of persecution or Article 3 harm if he is returned  to  Peru
      today.     Despite  the  treatment  he  received  at  about  the  time
      President Fujimori was being removed from office there is no  evidence
      whatever in the objective material that has been produced  before  us,
      which is the US  Department  of  State  Report  2003  compiled  on  25
      February 2004, that shows that members of Cambio 90 are  at  any  real
      risk of persecution.   Peru at  present  is  a  multi-party  republic.
      There has been a decade of authoritarian government but  that  is  now
      over.   There are still considerable problems in many areas  including
      unlawful or unwarranted killings by police but we do not see how  this
      claimant is at any real risk of physical harm, over and above the risk
      run by any ordinary Peruvian citizen,  if he is to return.   It is not
      illegal to be a member of Cambio 90, they have members in the  current
      parliament.   One of those members has recently had to resign  because
      of suspicions of corruption but that merely emphasises the point  that
      we have made which is that Cambio 90 is represented  in  the  Peruvian
      parliament.  There is no suggestion that the claimant is the  sort  of
      person who would command national attention or who would be noticed on
      his return to Peru after being out of the country for a period  of  3ï¿½
      years.   If he were to return to Peru he would be flown to the airport
      at Lima, he would be able to pass through the checks that there  would
      be on him at that airport with no problem because the only matter that
      sets him apart from any other Peruvian citizen is that he has  been  a
      supporter of Cambio 90, a perfectly  legal  organisation  for  him  to
      belong to.   There is no real suggestion that the authorities in  Lima
      would know or be interested in that fact.  If he were to pass  through
      the airport at Lima, even if he were to find himself  in  difficulties
      in his own immediate area still after the  period  of  time  that  has
      elapsed   we can see no difficulty in him relocating to other parts of
      the country where he would not be known.  We repeat, as far as we  can
      tell from the objective material, political affiliation to Cambio  90,
      which is the sole ground that has led to him fearing  the  authorities
      in Peru, is not a matter that is likely  to  lead  him  or  any  other
      Peruvian citizen into any real risk of persecution.

8.    For these reasons this appeal is dismissed.
