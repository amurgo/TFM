Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Jafferji (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mrs H Aboni (Senior HOPO)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Jerromes, promulgated on  1st  August  2016,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 26th July 2016.  In the determination,  the
    judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant on Article  8  ECHR  grounds.
    The Respondent subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Pakistan, who was born on  28th
    May 1996.  She appealed against the decision of  the  Respondent  Entry
    Clearance Officer dated 20th May 2015 refusing her application to  join
    her sponsoring husband, who is present and based in the United Kingdom,
    and whose name is Sajid Hussain.  The said  decision  of  the  ECO  was
    upheld by the Entry Clearance Manager on 20th August 2015.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim, in relation to the decision letter against  her,
    is that her husband does earn the requisite �18,600 for  the  financial
    threshold requirement, because there was evidence before  the  decision
    maker that for the twelve months preceding the application the  Sponsor
    earned a total of �18,825.15, from a variety of separate sources.   The
    main ones here are the income from  Gentino  Casino  and  from  William
    Hill.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge concluded that he was satisfied that the Sponsor's employment
    with Gentino Casino started  from  9th  February  2015,  and  therefore
    showed only an income for  less  than  six  months  ago  prior  to  the
    application being made on 2nd March 2015.  The Appellant's income  from
    Ladbrokes was  �351,  and  from  Gentino  Casino  was  �795,  and  from
    Recruitment Base was �8,750 gross.  There was  a  letter  from  William
    Hill dated 17th December 2014 to the effect that the  Sponsor's  annual
    gross salary was �10,284.67.  But the judge concluded that the payslips
    from William Hill (excluding 27th February 2014 as  this  fell  outside
    the relevant period) showed a gross income of only �7,622.83.  He  went
    on to say that the payslip for March 2014 (if there was  one)  was  not
    included and therefore there was only evidence of income  from  William
    Hill during the relevant period of �7,622.83.

 5. The judge then applied the Supreme Court case in Mandalia  [2015]  UKSC
    59.  This case, however, raised the  question  of  the  decision  maker
    having to invoke the evidential flexibility  policy  where  information
    could be forthcoming in relevant respects, but the  judge  went  on  to
    conclude that,

         "I am satisfied that requesting the missing payslip for March  2014
         from William Hill would be of no avail as based  on  the  Sponsor's
         usual monthly salary from William Hill, it  is  extremely  unlikely
         this March salary would  meet  the  shortfall  of  �1,081.17"  (see
         paragraph 23).

    With this, the judge concluded that the Appellant could not satisfy the
    Immigration Rules.

 6. He then went on to consider the position under Article 8 and,  applying
    the case of Razgar, and the five step  approach  there,  and  concluded
    that it would not be disproportionate to disallow the appeal on Article
    8 grounds, even if there was a British citizen child, J,  born  of  the
    parties, because he was free to enter the UK at any time and live  with
    the Sponsor, who lived with his mother  and  sisters,  and  they  would
    assist in looking and caring for J.



Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the judge erred at  paragraph  22
    of her determination by excluding the Appellant's total income from his
    employment with William Hill from February 2014 until February 2015, or
    even up to 31st January 2015.  This is because Appendix FM-SE makes  it
    clear that,

         "Where this Appendix requires the applicant  to  provide  specified
         evidence  relating  to  a  period  which  ends  with  the  date  of
         application, that evidence, or the most recently dated part of  it,
         must  be  dated  no  earlier  than  28  days  before  the  date  of
         application".

    Given that the Appellant's application was made on 2nd March 2015,  and
    as specified evidence was required in this case relating  to  a  period
    ending with a date of  the  application,  that  evidence  could  be  no
    earlier  than  28  days  before  the  date  of  the  application.   The
    Appellant's salary from William Hill for February 2014 and  March  2014
    should have been included in the calculation and the Appellant's income
    would then be claimed as �8,928.65.  There would be no shortfall.

 8. Second, the ECO himself had not stated that the March  2014  wage  slip
    was missing (paragraph 5 of the determination) and the judge should not
    have held this against the Appellant.

 9. Third, if the judge had added the Sponsor's  income  for  February  and
    March 2014 to the total for the relevant year  for  William  Hill  then
    there would also have been no shortfall.

10. On 2nd November 2016, permission to appeal was  granted  on  the  basis
    that (a) it was arguable that the judge failed  to  take  into  account
    that evidence could be dated no earlier than 28 days before the date of
    the application.  It was further arguable that the relevant period  was
    therefore 1st February 2014 to 1st February  2015.   Moreover,  it  was
    arguable that the judge should have noted that the March 2014 wage slip
    had not been missing from the application made to the ECO.

11. On 29th November 2016, a Rule 24 response was  entered  to  the  effect
    that the judge's calculations had led him to  find  that  the  relevant
    income  was  only  �17,518.33,  and  this  fell   below   the   �18,600
    requirement.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on 4th May 2017,  Mr  Jafferji,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, submitted that  fundamentally,  he  would  now
    place reliance upon the Supreme Court judgment in MM  (Lebanon)  [2017]
    UKSC 10, which was decided on 22nd February 2017, because in that  case
    the Supreme Court held that the  Immigration  Rules  did  not  actually
    cater for the Section 55 BCIA 2009  obligation  to  promote  the  "best
    interests" of the child, who was overseas, because in the instant case,
    the child, J, was living overseas in Pakistan with his mother,  and  if
    the Appellant could not meet the financial requirement test of  showing
    that her sponsoring husband earned �18,600, then she  would  be  barred
    from returning to the UK with her child, whose  "best  interest"  could
    not be safeguarded.  Second, although permission had  been  granted  in
    this case on the basis that the March 2014 wage slip does not appear to
    have been missing from the application before the ECO, he, Mr Jafferji,
    had not himself seen that March 2014 wage slip, although he would  have
    to say, that if the ECO had not raised the point, then it was not  open
    to the judge to raise it without notice at the hearing, so as to  catch
    the Sponsor unawares with a new issue.  Third,  the  case  of  Mandalia
    [2015] UKSC 59 saw the Supreme Court  emphasise  that  where  a  single
    document, in a sequence of  other  documents,  was  missing,  then  the
    evidential flexibility policy  enabled  a  decision  maker  to  make  a
    request for the documentation that was missing to be traced.  The  wage
    slip  for  March  2014  could  certainly  have  been  relevant,  on   a
    freestanding consideration outside the Immigration Rules, to the issues
    that the judge had to determine.

13. For her part, Mrs Aboni submitted that she would rely upon the Rule  24
    response.  Permission was only granted on the basis that the March wage
    slip had not been regarded as an issue by the ECO, but was made one  by
    the judge, without notice being given to the Appellant.  However,  this
    did not matter because the Appellant could not, in any  event,  succeed
    because even with the March 2014 wage slip, the Sponsor's  wages  would
    suffer  a  shortfall  of   �1,081.17   (see   paragraph   23   of   the
    determination).  Second, the ECO had properly rejected  the  wage  slip
    from William Hill because the Sponsor's employment  with  William  Hill
    ended in December 2014.

14. In reply, Mr Jafferji submitted that the judge did not think  that  the
    William  Hill  employment  was  relevant,  and   wrongly   excluded   a
    consideration of the 27th February 2014 wage slip (see his paragraph 22
    of the determination), but this was the last payslip from William Hill,
    and it would have been within the twelve month period, and if  the  ECO
    did not treat the March 2014 wage slip as being missing,  then  if  all
    the existing wage slips had been  taken  into  account,  the  financial
    threshold requirement would have been satisfied.   On  the  worst  case
    scenario, only one payslip from a series of payslips was missing and  a
    request for further information,  in  accordance  with  the  policy  on
    evidential flexibility, should have been made, and this would have been
    entirely in accordance with what the Supreme Court stated in  Mandalia.



Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

16. First, the judge  excluded  the  27th  February  2014  wage  slip  (see
    paragraph 22) which was within the period that  was  relevant,  because
    the Rule states that the evidence should be dated no  earlier  than  28
    days before the date of the application, and the relevant period  stood
    at 1st February 2014 to 1st February 2015.

17. Second, the suggestion that the William Hill payslip of  December  2014
    could properly be excluded because at that time the Sponsor  had  ended
    his  employment  there,  is  untenable  because  it  demonstrated   the
    Sponsor's employment at a time no  earlier  than  28  days  before  the
    making of the application.

18. Third, insofar as there is an issue relating to the missing March  2014
    wage slip, this was  not  raised  by  the  ECO,  so  that  one  natural
    inference must have been that it was not missing in  the  documentation
    before the original decision  maker  at  the  post  overseas.   Another
    inference, of course is, that if it is only a single wage slip that  is
    missing, from a list of other wage slips, then it is easily retrievable
    by a request for further information in accordance with the  policy  on
    evidential flexibility, and the failure to  do  that,  particularly  in
    circumstances where it may have been known  to  have  existed  at  some
    point, disadvantaged the Appellant unnecessarily.

19. Finally and no less importantly, against  this  particular  background,
    the strictures of the Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10 need
    taking on board, namely, that the Immigration Rules do not advance  the
    objectives of the "best interests" provisions as set out in Section  55
    of the BCIA 2009, where the child in question is living overseas.   Put
    another way, if the child, J, had been in the UK,  and  was  a  British
    citizen, it is not unlikely that the Secretary of State would not  have
    given consideration to exercising discretion in his favour.

20. This is  because  the  Immigration  Directorate  Instruction  -  Family
    Migration - Appendix FM, Section 1.0(b)  gives  important  guidance  at
    11.2.3 under the heading, "would it be unreasonable to expect a British
    citizen child to leave the UK?", which is to the effect that

         "Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker  must  not
         take a decision in relation to the parent or a primary carer  of  a
         British citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to
         force that British child to leave the EU, regardless of the age  of
         that child".

    In the circumstances, it is at least conceivable  that  the  evidential
    flexibility policy should have been considered with respect to a single
    March 2014 missing wage slip, which is  to  say  nothing  of  the  27th
    February wage slip not having been taken into account.

Re-Making the Decision

21. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before her, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal only to the limited extent that it is
    remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal, to be determined by  a  judge
    other than Judge Jerromes under Practice Statement 7.2(b)  because  the
    nature or extent of the judicial fact-finding  which  is  necessary  in
    order for the decision in the appeal to be remade is such that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in Rule  2,  it  is  appropriate  to
    remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is  allowed
to the extent that it is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal,  to  be
determined by a judge other than Judge  Jerromes  under  Practice  Statement
7.2(b).

No anonymity direction is made.

The appeal is allowed.
