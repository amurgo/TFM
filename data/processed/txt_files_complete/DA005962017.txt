For the respondent:    Ms E Fitzsimons, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS
Background

   1. The appellant is a Polish National born  on  20  March  1979.  He  has
      resided in the United Kingdom since about 2007. On 27 January 2017  he
      was sentenced to 48 months  imprisonment  following  conviction  on  3
      counts of fraudulent  evasion  of  duty.  On  29  September  2017  the
      Secretary of State made a deportation order  exercising  powers  under
      regulation  23(6)  of  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
      Regulations 2016 ("the Regulations").



The FTT Decision

   2. For reasons set out in  his  decision  of  27  June  2019  First  Tier
      Tribunal ("FTT") Judge Devittie allowed the appellant's appeal. Before
      moving to consider the grounds of appeal it is worth reflecting on the
      structure of the FTT Judge's decision:



        a. After a succinct introduction including the relevant  sentencing
           remarks, he sets out the Respondent's submissions  (para.5)  and
           the Appellant's submissions(para.6)




        b. At para.7 he sets out the legal  framework  reproducing  regs.23
           and 27 and schedule 1. At para.8 of the judgment  he  refers  to
           rehabilitation and specifically to MC (Essa  principles  recast)
           Portugal [2015] UKUT 520 (IAC)




        c. He deals with the oral and written evidence in  support  of  the
           Appellant's case at paras.9 and 10 (in respect of the appellant)
           para.11 (in respect of the appellant's partner) and para.12  (in
           respect of the appellant's employment history and the supporting
           evidence of three friends)




        d. He deals with the documentary evidence at para.13.




        e. At paras.14 to 17 he deals with his assessment of  the  evidence
           and  the  reasons  for  that  assessment.  First  (para.15)   he
           considers if the appellant is entitled to an enhanced  level  of
           protection  (under  reg.27(3)).  At  para.16  he  expresses  his
           conclusion that reg.27(3) does not apply.  Next  (para.17),  the
           FTT Judge goes on to consider whether  the  appellant's  conduct
           constitutes a "genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat"
           (see reg.27(5)(c)). He there concludes, after referring  to  the
           evidence which might suggest a  contrary  conclusion,  that  the
           appellant does not constitute such a threat.




        f.  At  paras.18,  19  and  20  the  FTT  Judge  deals   with   the
           proportionality of deportation by reference to  the  appellant's
           ties to the United Kingdom, his family life and the risk of  re-
           offending. The FTT Judge also  refers  to  rehabilitation,  thus
           dealing with the point he raised at para.8.  His  conclusion  is
           that deportation would not be proportionate.



The Law in outline

   3. Reg.23(6)(b) permits the removal of an EEA national if  the  Secretary
      of State decides that that person's removal is justified on grounds of
      public policy:



           23.- Exclusion and removal from the United Kingdom

           .....

           (6)  ...... an EEA national who has entered the  United  Kingdom
           or the family member of such a  national  who  has  entered  the
           United Kingdom may be removed if-

           (a)  ....

           (b)  the Secretary  of  State  has  decided  that  the  person's
           removal  is  justified  on  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
           security or public health in accordance with regulation 27; or

           (c)  .....



   4. When the Secretary of State  considers  if  removal  is  justified  on
      public policy grounds the decision must be taken  in  accordance  with
      reg.27 and in particular the six principles set out at reg.27(5):



           27.-  Decisions  taken  on  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
           security and public health




           (1)  In this regulation, a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
           decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security
           or public health.

           ......

           (5)  The public policy and public security requirements  of  the
           United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise conferred by
           these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental  interests
           of society, and where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of
           public policy or public  security  it  must  also  be  taken  in
           accordance with the following principles-




           (a)   the  decision  must   comply   with   the   principle   of
           proportionality;

           (b)  the decision must be  based  exclusively  on  the  personal
           conduct of the person concerned;

           (c)  the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  must  represent  a
           genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one
           of the fundamental interests of  society,  taking  into  account
           past conduct of the person and that the threat does not need  to
           be imminent;

           (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case or  which
           relate to considerations of general prevention  do  not  justify
           the decision;

           (e)   a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not   in
           themselves justify the decision;

           (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative grounds, even  in
           the absence of a  previous  criminal  conviction,  provided  the
           grounds are specific to the person.




           (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of  public
           policy and public security in relation to a person ("P") who  is
           resident in the United Kingdom, the  decision  maker  must  take
           account of considerations such as  the  age,  state  of  health,
           family and economic situation of P, P's length of  residence  in
           the United Kingdom, P's social and cultural integration into the
           United Kingdom and the extent of P's links with P's  country  of
           origin.

           (7) ....

           (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether the requirements of
           this regulation are met must (in particular) have regard to  the
           considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations of public
           policy, public security and the fundamental interests of society
           etc.).




   5. Schedule 1 provides as follows:



           CONSIDERATIONS  OF  PUBLIC  POLICY,  PUBLIC  SECURITY  AND   THE
           FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY ETC.

           Considerations of public policy and public security




           1.  The EU Treaties do not impose  a  uniform  scale  of  public
           policy  or  public  security   values:   member   States   enjoy
           considerable discretion, acting within the parameters set by the
           EU Treaties, applied where relevant by  the  EEA  agreement,  to
           define their own standards of public policy and public security,
           for purposes tailored to their individual contexts, from time to
           time.




           Application of paragraph 1 to the United Kingdom




           2.  An EEA national or the family  member  of  an  EEA  national
           having extensive familial and societal links with persons of the
           same nationality or language does not amount to  integration  in
           the United Kingdom; a significant degree of wider  cultural  and
           societal integration must be present  before  a  person  may  be
           regarded as integrated in the United Kingdom.




           3.  Where an EEA  national  or  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
           national has received a custodial sentence, or is  a  persistent
           offender, the longer the sentence,  or  the  more  numerous  the
           convictions, the greater the likelihood  that  the  individual's
           continued presence in the United Kingdom represents  a  genuine,
           present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  of   the
           fundamental interests of society.




           4.  Little weight is to be attached to the integration of an EEA
           national or the family member of  an  EEA  national  within  the
           United Kingdom if the alleged integrating links were  formed  at
           or around the same time as-




           (a)the commission of a criminal offence;




           (b)an act  otherwise  affecting  the  fundamental  interests  of
           society;




           (c)the EEA national or family member of an EEA national  was  in
           custody.




           5.  The removal from the United Kingdom of an  EEA  national  or
           the family member of an EEA national  who  is  able  to  provide
           substantive evidence of not demonstrating a threat (for example,
           through demonstrating that the EEA national or the family member
           of an EEA national has successfully reformed  or  rehabilitated)
           is less likely to be proportionate.




           6.  It is consistent with  public  policy  and  public  security
           requirements in the United Kingdom that  EEA  decisions  may  be
           taken in order  to  refuse,  terminate  or  withdraw  any  right
           otherwise conferred by these Regulations in the case of abuse of
           rights or fraud, including-




           (a)entering, attempting to enter or assisting another person  to
           enter or to attempt to enter, a marriage, civil  partnership  or
           durable partnership of convenience; or




           (b)fraudulently obtaining or attempting to obtain, or  assisting
           another to obtain or to attempt to obtain,  a  right  to  reside
           under these Regulations.

           The fundamental interests of society




           7.  For the  purposes  of  these  Regulations,  the  fundamental
           interests of society in the United Kingdom include-




           (a)preventing unlawful immigration and abuse of the  immigration
           laws, and maintaining the integrity  and  effectiveness  of  the
           immigration control system (including under  these  Regulations)
           and of the Common Travel Area;




           (b)maintaining public order;




           (c)preventing social harm;




           (d)preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;




           (e)protecting public services;




           (f)excluding or removing an EEA national or family member of  an
           EEA national with a conviction (including where the  conduct  of
           that person is likely to cause, or has in  fact  caused,  public
           offence) and maintaining public confidence in the ability of the
           relevant authorities to take such action;




           (g)tackling offences likely to cause harm to  society  where  an
           immediate or direct victim may  be  difficult  to  identify  but
           where there is wider societal harm (such as offences related  to
           the misuse of drugs or crime with a  cross-border  dimension  as
           mentioned in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the  Functioning  of
           the European Union);




           (h)combating the effects of persistent  offending  (particularly
           in relation to  offences,  which  if  taken  in  isolation,  may
           otherwise be unlikely to meet  the  requirements  of  regulation
           27);




           (i)protecting the rights and freedoms  of  others,  particularly
           from exploitation and trafficking;




           (j)protecting the public;




           (k)acting in the best interests  of  a  child  (including  where
           doing so entails  refusing  a  child  admission  to  the  United
           Kingdom, or otherwise taking an EEA decision against a child);




           (l)countering terrorism  and  extremism  and  protecting  shared
           values.




   6. Reg.27(5)(c) requires the personal conduct of  the  person  threatened
      with removal to represent a "genuine, present and sufficiently serious
      threat" affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society.  Those
      interests are listed (the list in each case is non-exclusive) at reg.7
      and para.7 of schedule 1 to the Regulation.



   7.  Reg.27(6)  requires  the  Secretary  of  State  to  take  account  of
      considerations such as the  individual's  family  situation,  age  and
      length  of  residence  and  integration  into   the   United   Kingdom
      (reg.27(6)).



   8. Reg.27(8) requires a court or tribunal considering if the requirements
      of the Regulation are met to "have regard to" schedule 1. The schedule
      broadly provides guidance on how  the  Tribunal  should  approach  the
      question of whether the Secretary of State's decision has been made in
      accordance with reg.27. For example, paras.2 and 4 provide guidance on
      the subject of integration (see reg.27(6)), para.3  provides  guidance
      on the question of whether  the  relevant  person  poses  a  "genuine,
      present and persistent threat" (see  reg.27(5)(c))  and  para.5  deals
      with proportionality (reg.27(5)(a)).



   9. The principles set out at reg.27(5) represent mandatory  guidance.  It
      was accepted before us that if the personal conduct of  the  potential
      deportee does  not  represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
      serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society
      then there should be no removal. We are  satisfied  that  the  parties
      were right to take this approach: see the Court of Justice decision in
      B v Land Baden-Wurttemburg (Case C-316/16) at para.92 cited at para.28
      of Vomero v SSHD [2019] 1 WLR 4729 referring to Art.27(2) of Directive
      2004/38.



The grounds of appeal

  10. The Secretary of State advances four grounds of appeal in  support  of
      her position that the FTT Judge made one or more errors  of  law.  The
      FTT Judge:



        a. Ground 1: Was not entitled on the evidence to conclude that  the
           appellant had accepted responsibility for his offending




        b. Ground 2: Failed properly to apply the EEA Regulations or in the
           alternative, if the Regulations were properly applied failed  to
           give adequate reasons for his conclusions




        c. Ground 3:  Gave  inadequate  reasons  for  his  conclusion  that
           deportation would be disproportionate




        d. Ground 4: Gave no reasons for his finding that  the  appellant's
           rehabilitation would be more effective in the United Kingdom.



Grounds 1 and 2

  11. Properly understood it seems to  us  that  these  grounds  go  to  the
      central question of whether the FTT Judge  was  entitled  to  conclude
      that the appellant's personal conduct represented a  genuine,  present
      and sufficiently serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
      interests of society.



  12. At paragraph 17 of the judgment and its sub-paragraphs, the FTT  Judge
      applies his mind to reg.27(5)(c).



  13. At paragraph 17(1) reference is made to OASys (the Offender Assessment
      System used by the National Probation Service) which records that  the
      appellant poses a "low risk" of re-offending. The  FTT  Judge  records
      that he was satisfied on the evidence of the  appellant  that  he  had
      accepted  responsibility  for  his  offending.  The  appellant's  oral
      evidence was that being in prison, and in particular being  away  from
      his family, had had a dramatic effect on him. In  the  same  paragraph
      the FTT Judge records that the "uncontested evidence" is  that  whilst
      in prison the appellant "sought to address his offending  [and  sought
      to] make himself a better person".



  14. At paragraph 17(2) and (3) the FTT Judge notes that the appellant  has
      complied with all probation and licence requirements  and  finds  that
      the effect of imprisonment on him (in particular his absence from  his
      family and the stress that brought to him, his partner and their  son)
      has been to deter him from crime.



  15. At paragraph 17(4) the FTT Judge makes a finding  that  the  appellant
      poses a low risk of re-offending.  In  reaching  that  conclusion  the
      Judge clearly had regard to all of the evidence (see paragraphs 9, 10,
      12 and 13 of the judgment - the evidence  came  from  the  appellant's
      friends Joanna Kordys, Marta Kaizu and  Wieslaw  Kowal  each  of  whom
      spoke to his rehabilitation, reports from 3 probation officers Kirsten
      Pady, Cheryl Brown and Julie O'Boyle, the OASys report  and  from  the
      appellant himself). He describes  the  evidence  as  "compelling"  and
      deals with the length of  his  prison  sentence.  He  notes  that  the
      position under the Regulations is that "the higher  the  sentence  the
      greater the likelihood of re-offending". It is important to note  that
      the FTT Judge refers to aspects of the evidence which  might  tend  to
      suggest a different conclusion,  that  the  second  offence  had  been
      committed whilst the appellant was on bail and that the  appellant  in
      the past had tried to downplay his role in the  criminality.  The  FTT
      Judge concludes the paragraph with  a  finding  that  the  appellant's
      conduct does not (paraphrasing reg.27(5)(c)) present  a  "genuine  and
      serious threat".



Disposition of grounds 1 and 2

  16.  It is clear from those parts of the judgment we have referred to that
      the FTT Judge had in mind that the reg.27(5)(c) question  was  central
      to the appeal. It also seems to  us  that  the  Judge's  reference  at
      para.17(4) to the link between re-offending  and  the  length  of  the
      sentence is paraphrasing what is said at para.3 of schedule 1.



  17. It therefore seems to us that the FTT Judge clearly and obviously took
      account of relevant schedule 1 matters when  considering  whether  the
      appellant represented a "threat".



  18.  It seems to us that there is a strong link between  reg.27(5)(c)  and
      the risk of re-offending. It is difficult to see how a person who  has
      a low risk of re-offending is a person  whose  conduct  represents  "a
      genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat"  to  one  of  the
      fundamental interests of society.



  19. We have shown at paragraphs 9 to 13 how the FTT Judge dealt  with  the
      evidence of the risk of re-offending. It is important to bear in  mind
      that the Secretary of State (unsurprisingly) called no evidence before
      the FTT going to the reg.27(5)(c) issue. The issue for the  FTT  Judge
      was then largely one of credibility  judged  in  the  context  of  the
      entirety of the evidence he heard. In  our  view  the  FTT  Judge  was
      clearly entitled to make the findings  he  made,  including  that  the
      evidence in support of his conclusion was compelling.



  20. We have therefore come to the conclusion that grounds 1 and 2 must  be
      dismissed.  Given  the  primacy  of  the  "threat"  assessment   under
      reg.27(5)(c) this disposes of the appeal. However, from  an  abundance
      of caution, the FTT Judge went on to consider proportionality.



Grounds 3 and 4 disposition

  21. Having found the appellant not to pose a "threat" the FTT  Judge  went
      on to consider proportionality and rehabilitation at paragraphs 18 and
      19.  There  is  clearly  a  close  link  between  rehabilitation   and
      proportionality. Para.5 of schedule 1 sets out the only  reference  to
      "rehabilitation" in the Regulation as a factor to  take  into  account
      when assessing proportionality.



  22. In our view the FTT correctly approached the issue of  proportionality
      correctly, taking account of how long the appellant had lived  in  the
      United Kingdom,  his  relationship  with  his  fianc�e  and  son,  his
      fianc�e's immigration status, her integration, the ease with which she
      could move to live a new life in Poland, the impact  of  severing  the
      family unit and the appellant's rehabilitation.



  23. It seems to us to be implicit in the FTT  Judge's  findings  that  the
      appellant's fianc�e "would not be able to follow him to Poland" if  he
      was deported that she would stay in the United Kingdom with their son.
      The FTT Judge was clearly persuaded that the appellant's family made a
      great contribution to his stability and kept him away from a  life  of
      crime. The FTT Judge's finding is that  he  has  a  lesser  chance  of
      continued rehabilitation if separated from his family.



  24. Grounds 3 and 4 seem to us to be  immaterial  given  our  findings  in
      respect of grounds 1 and 2. However, in our view grounds 3 and  4  are
      not made out. The FTT Judge gives adequate reasons for his  conclusion
      on proportionality and it is clear that in doing so he  has  carefully
      borne in mind not only para.5 of schedule 1 but also the  matters  set
      out at reg.27(6).



Conclusion

  25. The appeal is dismissed. None of the appeal grounds are made out.



Notice of decision


The FTT's decision does not contain a material error of law and  we  do  not
set it aside.
