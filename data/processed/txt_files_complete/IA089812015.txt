                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. This appeal has a  long  history.   The  appellant  is  a  national  of
    Nigeria, who came to the United Kingdom in 2007 on a student visa.  She
    has made a number of  subsequent  applications  for  leave  or  further
    leave.  In 2014 she was the subject of  a  decision  refusing  a  human
    rights claim, carrying an in-country right of  appeal.   She  appealed.
    Her appeal was dismissed by the First-tier  Tribunal  on  22  September
    2015, and permission to appeal to this Tribunal was refused in February
    2016.  That refusal was challenged by petition to the Court of Session.
     Although the appellant's case is based on the needs of children, there
    appears to have been  no  attempt  to  have  her  petition  dealt  with
    promptly.  It was concluded in the Court of Session by the Interlocutor
    of the Lord Ordinary Lord Mulholland dated 12 February 2020.

 2. On receipt of that decision I wrote to the  parties  in  the  following
    terms:

         "In the  circumstances  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  the  family
         situation is what it was in 2013 when the decision was made or 2015
         when the appeal was heard.  There may well  be  little  utility  in
         interposing any substantive procedure in  the  Upper  Tribunal.   I
         therefore propose without more ado to grant permission  to  appeal,
         to find error of law as averred in the Grounds of  Appeal,  and  to
         remit the appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal."

 3. Both parties have  responded  indicating  that  they  agree  with  that
    proposal.  Accordingly, I grant permission to appeal, I set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error of law, and I  remit  the
    appellant's appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.



                                                           C. M. G. Ockelton


                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL

                                                       Date: 2 December 2020
