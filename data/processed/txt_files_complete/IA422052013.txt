For the Respondent:    Miss M Bonsu, KC Law Chambers Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   We shall refer to the  parties  as  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
    Appellant is a citizen of Ghana born on 10 September 1970.  His  appeal
    against  the  Respondent's  refusal  to  issue  a  residence  card   as
    confirmation of a derivative right of  residence  was  dismissed  under
    Regulation 15A(4A) of  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006,  but
    allowed on Article 8 grounds to the limited extent that the application
    remained before the Respondent for a lawful decision to be made  on  on
    the Appellant's human rights claim.

2.   The Secretary of State appealed  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge C M Phillips  dated  14  November  2014.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted on 8 January 2015 on the grounds that the judge  was
    required to either allow or dismiss the  Appellant's  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds and the judge had no power to make the  order  that  she
    purported to make.

3.   The grounds rely on Lamichhane v the Secretary  of  State  [2010]  EWCA
    Civ 260 and contend that there was  no  Section  120  one  stop  notice
    served and therefore the Appellant could not raise before the  Tribunal
    any grounds advanced for leave to remain different from that which  was
    the subject of the  decision  that  the  Secretary  of  State  appealed
    against.

4.   At the hearing, the Respondent  submitted  that  the  judge  considered
    Article 8 and in effect remitted the decision back to the Secretary  of
    State but failed to give reasons for why the  decision  under  the  EEA
    Regulations  was  unlawful  on  the  basis  that  Article  8  was   not
    considered. Miss Brocklesby informed us that there was  a  case  to  be
    heard on Tuesday on whether Article 8 was engaged in EEA appeals but in
    any event there was an error of law in  this  case  because  the  judge
    allowed the appeal under Article 8 when she had no power to do so.

5.   Miss Bonsu for the Appellant submitted that it was part of the  judge's
    jurisdiction under the Human Rights Act 1998  effectively  to  consider
    Article 8 in all cases and therefore she was correct  to  consider  the
    Article 8 claim, and it was open to her to  require  the  Secretary  of
    State to consider Article 8 also.

6.   After a short  adjournment  there  was  consideration  of  whether  the
    appeal should proceed. Miss Bonsu invited us to stay the matter on  the
    basis that there would be a test case on Tuesday, or that the matter be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for Article  8  to  be  considered.
    For the reasons we are about to give we do not  propose  to  take  that
    action.

7.   The case law as it stands is JM (Rule 62(7)  human  rights  unarguable)
    Liberia [2006] UKAIT 00009 in which  the  Tribunal  held  that  if  the
    Appellant's human rights claim depends on the consequences of  removal,
    his human rights grounds cannot avail  him  in  any  appeal  against  a
    decision that does not entail removal.  That is in fact the case  here.



8.   Accordingly, we find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  erred  in  law
    in allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds insofar as the decision  of
    the Secretary of State remained outstanding for a lawful decision to be
    made. The decision to refuse to issue a residence card was a lawful one
    and it was conceded that  the  Appellant  could  not  satisfy  the  EEA
    Regulations 2006.

9.   Since there was no removal decision there would, in  our  view,  be  no
    interference with the Appellant's right to family life because  he  was
    not required to leave the  UK.  Therefore,  had  the  judge  considered
    Article 8 and made a decision on Article 8 she  should  have  concluded
    that there would have been no interference and therefore the Article  8
    claim could not succeed.

10.  The Appellant has not made a  claim  for  leave  to  remain  under  the
    Immigration Rules and it is still open to him to do so.

11.  Therefore, the Respondent's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is  allowed.
    The First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow the  appeal  on  Article  8
    grounds, to the limited extent that the application remained before the
    Respondent for a lawful decision to be made on  the  Appellant's  human
    rights claim, is set aside. Since there was no removal  decision  there
    would be no interference with the Appellant's family life and Article 8
    was not engaged.

12.  There was no error of law in the decision to dismiss the  appeal  under
    the EEA Regulations 2006 and the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    under those Regulations shall stand.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

We set aside the fee award of ï¿½70 made by the First-tier Tribunal.

The Appellant's appeal was dismissed under  the  EEA  Regulations  2006  and
therefore there can be no fee award.
