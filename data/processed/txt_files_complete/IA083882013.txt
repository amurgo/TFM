Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Dias, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1.  The  Secretary  of  State  appeals   with   permission   against   the
    determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  P  J   M   Hollingworth
    promulgated on 15 August 2013 in which he allowed  the  appeal  of  Mrs
    Mary  Rose  Esteban  ("the  claimant")  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  the
    spouse of a British national.  The judge did not allow the appeal under
    the Immigration Rules but did so pursuant to Article 8.

 2. There is little dispute over the facts of this case.  The Claimant  who
    is a citizen of the Philippines born on  3  February  1976  was  on  10
    February 2011 granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4
    General Student until 30 July 2012.  On 26 July 2012  she  applied  for
    her leave to remain to be varied on the basis  of  her  marriage  to  a
    British citizen.  The application was refused on the  sole  basis  that
    she had not provided the  necessary  evidence  to  meet  the  financial
    requirement set out in E-LTRP.3.1 of Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules that is a specified gross annual income of at least �18,600.

 3. The Claimant appealed against that decision on the basis that  she  did
    in fact meet the requirements of the Rules and in the alternative  that
    to require her to leave the United Kingdom was a breach of  her  rights
    pursuant to Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.

 4. When the appeal came before Judge Hollingworth the evidence adduced  by
    the appellant  indicated  that  her  husband's  income  was  �29,371.16
    comprising income from full-time work as a courier and from  a  private
    pension from Saudi Arabian Airlines.

 5. The evidence before the judge showed that the income had been generated
    prior to June 2013 and was confirmed  in  letters,  payslips  and  bank
    statements.

 6. The judge concluded that on the basis of Raju [2013] EWCA Civ that  the
    appellant could not show that he met the requirements of the  Rules  as
    the necessary evidence had not been provided to the respondent  at  the
    time of the application [9, 10] he went on to allow the appeal pursuant
    to Article 8.

 7. The respondent sought permission to appeal against the decision on  the
    basis that the judge had failed to  give  adequate  reasons  why  there
    would be a disproportionate breach of the appellant's Article 8 rights.



 8. In granting permission to appeal, First-tier Tribunal Judge Gibb stated

         "Given the positive findings as to the  finances  at  the  date  of
         hearing, however, it is arguable that this rested on a legal  error
         in the understanding application of Raju.  This  case  is  arguably
         narrower than suggested in  the  respondent's  submission  in  this
         case, which was accepted by the judge.  It may  therefore  be  that
         this is not in the category of MM cases where Article 8 is the sole
         issue.  What needs to be considered  first  is  whether  the  judge
         erred in law in paragraph  9  of  the  determination  in  excluding
         evidence despite this not being an entry clearance or PBS appeal."

 9. When the matter came before me, Mr  Walker  very  fairly  and  candidly
    accepted that the judge had misapplied the decision in Raju.  I  accept
    that that is correct.  First, this was not an appeal to  which  Section
    85A of the 2002 Act  applies.   Second,  as  Mr  Walker  conceded,  the
    Immigration Rules  in  Appendix  FM  do  not  require  evidence  to  be
    submitted prior to a specific date nor is it a requirement of  Appendix
    FM that the relevant gross annual income must be in a period ending  on
    the date of application rather than the date of decision.

10. The judge found that the  appellant's  husband's  income  was  well  in
    excess of the minimum �18,600.  It therefore  follows  that  he  should
    have allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.  The determination
    was therefore not in accordance with the law in the light of the ground
    identified in the grant of permission from  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Gibb.

11. In the circumstances therefore it is unnecessary  for  me  to  consider
    whether the decision of Judge Hollingworth to allow the appeal on human
    rights grounds was an error of law given  that  as  he  ought  to  have
    allowed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules,  that  error  was  not
    material.

12.  In  the  circumstances,  I  set  aside  the  determination  of   Judge
    Hollingworth and I substitute it  by  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

SUMMARY OF DECISIONS

   1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law and I set it aside.
   2. I remake the decision by allowing the  appeal  under  the  immigration
      rules.
