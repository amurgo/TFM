Representation:
For the Appellant:           Ms J Isherwood (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)
For the Respondent:        Mr S Hyder (Simon Noble Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 13 January 2017  allowing  the  appeal  of
       Aleem Mohammed (who is accordingly the Respondent to this appeal),  a
       citizen of India born 15 December 1980, itself  brought  against  the
       refusal of his application for leave to remain as a Tier 4 migrant of
       7 September 2015.


    2. The Respondent applied for leave as a Tier 4 migrant on 22 May  2014.
       His application had originally been refused on the basis that he  had
       submitted a TOEIC certificate from ETS on 15 October 2012 as evidence
       of his English language proficiency which had now been identified  by
       ETS as invalid. Accordingly his application was refused on the  basis
       that the test result had been fraudulently obtained.


    3. Grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  argued  that  the
       Secretary of State had produced  no  documentary  evidence  regarding
       ETS's conclusion as  to  invalidity  and  the  manner  in  which  the
       Respondent was said to have been dishonest.


    4. The First-tier Tribunal heard the Respondent's appeal. In his witness
       statement, the  Respondent  had  stated  that  the  allegations  made
       against  him  were  baseless.  He  had  previously  provided  English
       language test results from City and Guilds  of  4  October  2012  and
       Pearson English exam of 14 August  2014.  He  had  contacted  ETS  in
       relation to his TOEIC test with ETS of December 2012,  and  was  told
       that they could provide no information about a test taken  more  than
       two years earlier.


    5.  The First-tier Tribunal allowed the Respondent's appeal on the basis
       that he spoke good English and  expressed  himself  adequately  under
       cross examination, giving evidence that  was  generally  satisfactory
       and coherent,  and  that  his  academic  performance  was  consistent
       strong, and had not been criticised by the Home Office; he had passed
       all his examinations and successfully completed the City  and  Guilds
       and Pearson English tests, taken after the  ETS  test,  demonstrating
       that he had always had the  capacity  to  prove  his  proficiency  in
       English under exam conditions, including at the date of the tests.


    6. The Secretary of State appealed. Permission to appeal was granted  on
       23 May 2017 by the First-tier Tribunal on  the  basis  that  arguably
       inadequate reasons had been given for the decision.


    7. Ms Isherwood for the Secretary of State submitted that  the  decision
       was inadequate, and that the witness statement had not given  details
       of the Respondent's recollection of the testing process. The  witness
       statement from Rebecca Collings included her statement that  para  18
       that Eden College was  one  of  the  test  centres  specifically  the
       subject of the notorious BBC documentary  that  spawned  the  enquiry
       leading to ETS's review of many of the decisions.


    8. Mr Hyder submitted that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was a
       lawful and adequate response to the evidence before it.  The  witness
       statement combined with  the  oral  evidence  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal was sufficient to provide a reasonably plausible response to
       the allegation of dishonesty; the generalised nature of the  material
       the Home Office had put forward simply failed to do so.




Findings and reasons


    9. The Upper Tribunal cites  expert  evidence  deployed  by  a  litigant
       seeking to cast doubt upon the validity testing process used  by  ETS
       in Gazi (IJR) [2015] UKUT 327 (IAC):


           "Dr Harrison  also  examines,  with  accompanying  critique  and
           commentary,   the   discrete   issues   of   factors   affecting
           performance; the typical performance of human verification;  the
           definition of thresholds; the explicit acknowledgement of  human
           errors; the lack of testing of the performance of analysts;  the
           dubious touchstone of "confidence" (see Mr Millington's  witness
           statement); the dearth of information about the actual  analysis
           methodology;  the  lack  of  detail  about  the  experience  and
           knowledge of both the recruited analysts and their  supervisors;
           the indication that any training of the newly recruited analysts
           was  hurried;  the  shortcomings  in  Mr   Millington's   speech
           recognition averments; and the clear acknowledgement on the part
           of ETS that false identifications (viz false  positive  results)
           have occurred. One passage relating to  the  human  verification
           process is especially noteworthy:


                 "... although the analysts only verified matches where they
                 had no doubt about their validity  -  ie  where  they  were
                 certain about their judgments - this should not be taken as
                 a reliable indicator of the accuracy  of  those  judgments.
                 This approach does not remove the risk  of  false  positive
                 results."


           Dr Harrison also highlights that both the automatic  system  and
           the human analysts are capable of  false  positive  errors.  The
           Secretary of State's  evidence  does  not  disclose  either  the
           percentage or the volume of such errors."


   10. No findings were made on  that  evidence  in  Gazi.  However  in  the
       subsequent appeal of Qadir [2016] UKUT 229  (IAC)  the  UT  concludes
       that the  Home  Office  evidence  had  significant  shortcomings,  in
       particular at [63], a lack of  qualifications  or  expertise  of  the
       officials who visited ETS and produced witness  statements  based  on
       their visit to ETS, during which ETS was  the  sole  arbiter  of  the
       information  disclosed  and  assertions  made,  undue   Home   Office
       dependency on the information from ETS when ETS had  put  forward  no
       witness or indeed any other evidence whatsoever  of  their  own,  the
       lack of any expert evidence backing up the opinion of the  staff  who
       visited ETS, and the fact that voice recording files had  never  been
       put forward pertaining to the appellants themselves. Accordingly  the
       Tribunal accepted that the methods used by ETS were  not  necessarily
       guaranteed to avoid the occasional false positive whereby an innocent
       student is wrongly identified as having cheated in their test.


   11. It would be perfectly open to the Secretary of State to  put  forward
       further evidence of the methods used by ETS in order  to  answer  the
       critique of Dr Harrison, for example if their software was identified
       or the expertise of the ETS analysts was set out in  greater  detail.
       If she does not do so she runs the risk that fact-finders will employ
       similar reasoning to that in Qadir (subsequently upheld as lawful  by
       the Court of Appeal), ie that the direct evidence of genuineness  put
       forward by the migrant accused of dishonesty outweighs the   somewhat
       generalised material relied upon by the Home Office.


   12. The President explains in Muhandiramge [2015] UKUT  675  (IAC),  that
       decisions in these cases involve a "moderately complex  exercise"  in
       which "the evidential  pendulum  swings  three  times  and  in  three
       different directions". To quote more of his evocative words directly:




           "(a) First,  where  the  Secretary  of  State  alleges  that  an
           applicant  has  practised  dishonesty   or   deception   in   an
           application for leave to remain, there is an  evidential  burden
           on  the  Secretary  of  State.  This  requires  that  sufficient
           evidence be adduced to raise an issue as to the existence or non-
           existence of a fact in issue:  for  example,  by  producing  the
           completed application which is prima  facie  deceitful  in  some
           material fashion.


           (b) The spotlight thereby  switches  to  the  applicant.  If  he
           discharges the burden - again, an evidential one - of raising an
           innocent explanation, namely  an  account  which  satisfies  the
           minimum level of plausibility, a further transfer of the  burden
           of proof occurs.


           (c) Where (b) is satisfied, the burden rests on the Secretary of
           State to establish, on the balance of  probabilities,  that  the
           Appellant's prima facie innocent explanation is to be rejected.


           A veritable burden of proof boomerang!"


   13. There is nothing in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  which  is
       inconsistent with that approach;  it  clearly  appreciated  that  the
       burden of proof was generally on the Secretary  of  State,  and  that
       cogent explanations from an appellant  before  it  could  rebut  Home
       Office allegations of malpractice.  The Tribunal  below  was  plainly
       impressed by the Respondent's record of English language  proficiency
       as shown by his present skill in the language when he  gave  evidence
       before it,  and  additionally  by  his  historic  qualifications.  Ms
       Isherwood's response to  these  central  aspects  of  the  Tribunal's
       reasoning was to point me to the  finding  of  the  President  in  MA
       Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450 (IAC) �57:


           "In the abstract, of course, there is a range of reasons why
           persons proficient in English may engage in TOEIC fraud. These
           include, inexhaustively, lack of confidence, fear of failure,
           lack of time and commitment and contempt for the immigration
           system. These reasons could conceivably overlap in individual
           cases and there is scope for other explanations for deceitful
           conduct in this sphere. We are not required to make the further
           finding of why the Appellant engaged in deception and to this we
           add that this issue was not explored during the hearing. We
           resist any temptation to speculate about this discrete matter."


   14. Additionally, of course, there is the observation in Qadir  �80  that
       documentary   evidence   of   English   language   proficiency   from
       qualifications obtained over the period  in  which  the  Respondent's
       honesty is in question:


           "...is likely to be of substantially greater force and cogency
           than the tribunal's own assessment of an appellant's English
           language proficiency based on performance at the appeal hearing.
           This is especially pertinent in the present case, given that
           some three years have elapsed since this Appellant claims to
           have secured his TOEIC certificate. In some of the FtT decisions
           in this field one finds observations concerning the appellant's
           apparent fluency in, and command of, the English language. We
           consider that Judges should be cautious in adopting this
           approach for at least three reasons. The first is the passage of
           time. The second is that Judges are not language testing or
           linguistics experts. The third is that, to date, there has been
           no expert linguistic evidence in any of these cases."


   15. There is certainly one potential error in the approach, in  that  the
       Respondent's present ability to speak English as  assessed  from  his
       oral evidence was taken into  account  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
       Given that this assessment took place in the context of reference  to
       his earlier proficiency in the English language  as  attested  to  by
       test result certificates, a source of evidence expressly commended by
       the Upper Tribunal in Qadir, I do not consider that that is in itself
       a material error of law.


   16. I was briefly concerned with  the  fact  that  the  BBC's  "Panorama"
       programme which contributed to  the  discovery  of  widespread  TOIEC
       fraud had focused on two specific centres, one of  which  was  indeed
       Eden International College, where the Applicant underwent  his  test,
       as was explained in the Rebecca Collings  witness  statement  and  as
       noted in Gazi. It  seems  to  me  that  was  a  potentially  material
       consideration. However, the only reference to  Eden  College  in  the
       case put forward by the Secretary of State in the Tribunal below  was
       a brief mention in the statement by Rebecca Collings, and nothing  is
       said there regarding the ultimate extent of fraud at Eden College. In
       these circumstances I do not consider that the Secretary of State had
       done enough to warrant this aspect  of  her  case  receiving  express
       treatment by the First-tier Tribunal.


   17. True it is that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasons  are  concisely
       expressed. However, as stated by the President in Shizad (sufficiency
       of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC) �10: "reasons need not be
       extensive if the decision as a whole makes sense,  having  regard  to
       the material accepted by the judge". The reasoning  of  the  Tribunal
       below  is  perfectly  comprehensible:  a  combination  of   evidence,
       including the Appellant's general good character, and  his  past  and
       present proficiency in English, all combined to  impress  the  First-
       tier Tribunal to the extent it considered him a credible witness such
       that the Secretary of State had not discharged the  burden  of  proof
       upon  her  to  establish  that  his  test   results   were   procured
       dishonestly.

          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  any  material
    error of law and stands. The appeal is dismissed.
