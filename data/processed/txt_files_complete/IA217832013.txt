Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Iqbal
For the Respondent:    Mr G Jack


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 16  March  1991.
    He made an application on 3 September 2012 for leave to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  points-
    based system.  The application  was  refused  on  20  May  2013  and  a
    decision was also made to remove him from the UK by way  of  directions
    under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellant appealed that decision and the appeal was heard by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge M A Khan.  In  a  determination  promulgated  on  8
    November 2013 the judge dismissed the appeal.  On a renewed application
    to the  Upper  Tribunal  an  arguable  challenge  in  relation  to  the
    reasoning of the judge was found and the matter was then listed for  an
    oral hearing before me.

 3. By way of background the appellant claimed 25 points under Appendix  A:
    Attributes Access to Funds.  According to the refusal letter:-

         "You have stated that you have access to funds  of  �200,000  being
         made available to you(r) business by Mr  Sajjad  Afzal  Shawl.   As
         evidence of this you have provided:

         1.   Allied Bank Limited letter

         2.   a declaration from Mr Sajjad Afzal Shawl

         3.   a letter from Farani Javid Taylor Solicitors

         However, the bank letter is not  acceptable  because  it  does  not
         specifically confirm the amount of money  being  available  to  you
         from the third party's funds nor the  third  party's  full  contact
         details.

         The letter from  Farani  Javid  Taylor  Solicitors  that  you  have
         submitted is not acceptable as it  does  not  confirm  the  number,
         place of issue and dates of issue and expiry  of  Mr  Sajjad  Afzal
         Shawl's identity document.

         You have therefore not submitted the specified evidence  as  listed
         under paragraph 41-SD to establish that  you  have  access  to  the
         funds that you are claiming.

         In accordance with paragraph 41 of Appendix A  of  the  Immigration
         Rules, you are therefore not considered to have access to the funds
         you have claimed.

         The decision has been made not to request additional  documentation
         or exceptionally consider the application under the  provisions  of
         paragraph 245AA as  it  is  not  anticipated  that  addressing  the
         omission or error would lead to a grant of leave.

         You have not provided any evidence  that  you  qualify  for  points
         under any of the other provisions in the first row of  Table  4  of
         Appendix A of the Rules and we have therefore been unable to  award
         points for Attributes."

 4. The grounds of appeal refer to  that  refusal  and  go  on  to  say  at
    paragraph 4 that:-

         "As a domino effect points for other attributes were refused by the
         respondent for the appellant's inability to  score  25  points  for
         'access to funds' as alleged by the respondent."

    In fact that is not correct. Under "Appendix B:  English  language"  10
    points were claimed but the appellant  was  awarded  none  because  the
    score as shown by the English language test  certificate  provided  did
    not reach the minimum  level  of  C1  requirement  as  specified  under
    Appendix B.  Furthermore the qualification that the appellant  provided
    was a Diploma of Business Administration issued by West London  College
    which did not meet the requirements specified under Appendix B for  the
    award of points. This is because it is not recognised by  the  National
    Academic Recognition Information Centre for the UK as being  equivalent
    to a UK Bachelors Degree.  This latter  point  regarding  the  academic
    qualification does not appear to have been addressed  anywhere  in  the
    appellant's statement, by the judge  that  heard  the  appeal,  in  the
    grounds seeking permission to appeal or in submissions before me.

The Judge's Determination

 5. The judge that heard this appeal appeared to  think  that  because  the
    appellant knew little about the documents which had been submitted with
    his application the appellant was not a credible or consistent  witness
    and the documentary evidence he provided, about which he knows  little,
    is inconsistent and not credible either.  It is not apparent  how  this
    may be relevant to a PBS decision where strict requirements have to  be
    met and they are met by provision of the documentation itself.

 6. There was no suggestion  by  the  respondent  that  the  appellant  had
    produced forged or fraudulent documentation so it is difficult  in  the
    circumstances to understand the relevance of the  points  made  by  the
    judge.  Immigration Rule 245DD(l) applicable at the  time  showed  that
    the Secretary of State would not carry out (subsequently amended to may
    decide not to carry out) the assessment in 245 DD(h) if the application
    already falls for refusal on other grounds (my  italics)  but  reserves
    the right to carry out this assessment in any  reconsideration  of  the
    decision.  Rule 245 DD(h) refers to the Secretary of State  in  essence
    needing to be satisfied that the applicant's intentions are genuine and
    that money is genuinely available to the applicant.  This  is  the  so-
    called  "genuine  entrepreneur  test"  intended  to   deal   with   the
    credibility of suspicious applicants.

 7. In the current appeal the respondent did not carry out an assessment as
    she might have done under paragraph 245DD(h) so no  decision  had  been
    made  in  relation  to  the  appellant's  credibility  or  indeed   the
    genuineness of his application.

 8. It seems to me that the judge  was  entitled  to  comment  as  he  did.
    However, if his findings formed the  reasons  for  him  dismissing  the
    appeal there would have been procedural unfairness to the appellant  in
    that he was completely unaware of  the  point  that  was  to  be  taken
    against him coming as it did entirely unannounced at the  hearing.   It
    was not something that the judge needed to determine but  if  for  some
    reason he wished to do so he should have provided the reasons for  this
    and given the appellant the opportunity to respond.

 9. Whereas the judge appears to have erred I ask myself if  he  has  erred
    materially and I  consider  that  there  are  two  relevant  questions.
    Firstly, whether his findings on credibility were relevant  in  leading
    to his conclusion as to the appellant's inability to  meet  the  strict
    requirements of the  PBS  Rules.  Secondly,  whether  his  findings  on
    credibility could in any way have led to a different decision as to the
    requirement for the respondent to exercise her  evidential  flexibility
    policy in favour of the appellant if that policy applied.

10. I am far from persuaded that the judge did  err  materially  on  either
    point.   Paragraph  28  of  the  determination  makes  clear  that  the
    documentation provided does not meet the requirements of the Rules  and
    that "any request by the respondent under the  flexibility  rule  could
    not cure the deficiencies at the root of this  application".  Therefore
    the findings of the judge on  credibility  were  not  material  as  the
    conclusion would have been the same in any event.

11. I turn now to the matters raised as ground 2  in  the  grounds  seeking
    permission to  appeal  where  ground  2  incorporates  the  appellant's
    skeleton argument.

Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants Requirements for Leave to Remain

12. Paragraph 245DD sets out the qualifications for leave to  remain  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant. At the date of application the appellant
    was required to provide in support of his application all the  relevant
    documentation as per the Rules applicable at that date.

13. Paragraph 34A(iii) states that where an application form  is  specified
    the application must also comply with the requirement that any  section
    of the form which is designated as mandatory in  the  application  form
    and/or related guidance notes must be  completed  as  specified.   That
    relates to such an application as the current one.

14. Paragraph 34A (a) requires that the application be accompanied  by  the
    photographs and documents specified as  mandatory  in  the  application
    form and/or related guidance notes.

15. By  paragraph  34C  an  application  that  does  not  comply  with  the
    requirements  of  paragraph  34A  will  be  invalid  and  will  not  be
    considered.  Paragraph 34A is subject to paragraph A34 that deals  with
    the online application process.  See also 85A Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002  as  to  the  Tribunal  considering  only  evidence
    adduced by the appellant in support of and at the time  of  making  the
    application to which the immigration decision relates.

16. I deal with  the  English  language  requirement  point  first.   Under
    Appendix B as at the  date  of  application  the  requirement  for  the
    appellant's knowledge of English had  to  be  equivalent  to  level  C1
    although by Statement of Changes HC 760 as from 13  December  2012  the
    level became B1 (a lower threshold).  Although the judge did  not  deal
    with that matter it is apparent that the appellant did  not  meet  that
    requirement at  the  date  of  issue.   He  provided  an  English  test
    certificate from ETS TOEIC showing that he achieved a score of  475  in
    the listening section and 435 in  the  reading  section.   The  minimum
    level of the C1 requirement at the time of the application was 490  for
    listening and 455 for reading.

17. As to the Diploma of Business  Administration  issued  by  West  London
    College paragraph 7 of "Appendix  B  -  English  Language"  would  have
    allowed 10 points to be awarded for a degree taught in English  if  the
    applicant has a relevant level of English language  shown  in  Table  1
    (this  appellant  does  not)  and  if  he  has  obtained  an   academic
    qualification which "is deemed by  UK  NARIC  to  meet  the  recognised
    standard of a Bachelor's degree (not a Master's degree or a  PhD  )  in
    the UK, and UK  NARIC has confirmed  that  the  degree  was  taught  or
    researched in English to level CI of the  Council  of  Europe's  Common
    European Framework for Language Learning or above ...".

18. The appellant has not  obtained  that  academic  qualification  on  the
    evidence provided.

Submissions

19. Mr Iqbal's oral submissions  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  were  very
    lengthy and at one point drew the comment from me  that  if  I  was  to
    understand those submissions they should have  been  put  in  a  proper
    skeleton argument and made available for perusal prior to the  hearing.
    Mr Iqbal said that he had only been instructed for the  Upper  Tribunal
    hearing at the last moment although I note that he  did  appear  before
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge, so was better prepared, one  might  have
    thought, than me or the Presenting Officer.

20. I have no intention or need  to  set  out  Mr  Iqbal's  lengthy  verbal
    submissions that I noted down in full because I consider that the issue
    is far simpler than he submits. In any  event  on  examination  of  his
    written skeleton argument produced for the First-tier Tribunal  hearing
    broadly the same submissions are set out there.

21. In essence Mr Iqbal submits that when the requirements  of  Appendix  A
    are considered as to showing that the applicant  has  access  to  funds
    paragraph 41-SD (a) does not make specific reference to "money  from  a
    third party" whereas paragraph 41-SD (b) clearly does.   Therefore  the
    requirements of 41-SD (a) do not apply to the appellant, he has met the
    requirements of 41-SD (b), and therefore he has met the requirements of
    the Rules.

22. Mr Iqbal submits that the purpose of  these  complicated  Rules  is  to
    ensure that money is genuinely available to the applicant and  I  doubt
    that anybody would disagree with that  submission.   Mr  Iqbal  further
    submits that as 41-SD  stands  at  the  moment  it  appears  that  each
    applicant has to meet all the requirements of  subparagraphs  (a),  (b)
    and (c) but  on  a  careful  reading  subparagraphs  (b)  and  (c)  are
    conditional.  Subparagraph (b) is conditional upon use of  third  party
    funds and subparagraph (c) is conditional upon a few  requirements  out
    of which the most notable is to have last leave  to  remain  under  the
    Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) category.  Therefore either  subparagraph  (a)
    applies or (b) or (c) applies.  All three cannot apply at the same time
    unless the applicant uses a mixture of his own money and money  from  a
    third party.  Thus at the end of subparagraphs (a)  and  (b)  the  word
    "or" should have been used or paragraph 41-SD should be  read  in  this
    way.  Under subparagraph 41-SD (b) the appellant needs  to  demonstrate
    access to �200,000 and that is done by  fulfilling  the  conditions  of
    paragraph 41(a), (b) or (c) and (d)(3) of Appendix A and paragraph  41-
    SD(b).  The appellant it is said meets all of those conditions.  As  to
    paragraph 41 (d) (3) of Appendix A  it is the case that  this  was  not
    introduced until 31.01.2013 by Statement of Changes HC 943 and  so  did
    not apply at the date of this application.

Paragraph 41 of Appendix A

23. It may help to attach to this determination paragraph 41 and  paragraph
    41- SD as they were at date of application so I have done so.

24. Paragraph 41 of Appendix A defines how an applicant will be  considered
    to have access to funds. To do this an applicant will need  to  provide
    the specified documents in paragraph 41-SD to show cash  money  to  the
    amount required, that the applicant has permission to use the money  to
    invest in a business in the UK, and the money is either held  in  a  UK
    regulated financial institution or is transferable to the  UK  (as  per
    41(a) (b) and (c)).

25. There are then listed under 41-SD the specified documents  in  Table  4
    and paragraph 41 so that at 41-SD (a) the specified documents  required
    are "to show evidence of the money available to invest" which under 41-
    SD (a) (i) is a letter containing certain specified information.  41-SD
    (a) (ii) applies if the money is held in the UK (not  applicable  here)
    and 41-SD (a) (iii) refers to �50000 from a Venture  Capital  Firm  etc
    (not applicable here either).

26. Then I find that additionally if the applicant is using  money  from  a
    third party 41-SD (b) applies and the  applicant  has  to  provide  the
    various documents referred to which includes  a  letter  from  a  legal
    representative.

27. The letter provided by Allied Bank refers  to  an  application  of  the
    appellant for entrepreneur status and the fact that the  bank  has  the
    consent of Mr Shawl to

         "share these findings with the UKBA.  I will confirm  the  contents
         of this letter to the UKBA at their request.  Mr Sajjad Afzal Shawl
         has �200,000 available for investment and will be disposable in the
         United Kingdom on his request."

    On any view that letter does not comply  with  the  specified  document
    requirements of the Rules not least because it does not show Mr Shawl's
    contact details or that the appellant has permission to use the sum  of
    �200000.

28. As a matter of common sense it seems to me that the  interpretation  of
    the Rules as drafted at the applicable time allows for none other  than
    as is set out above.  It is apparent to me that the appellant  has  not
    met the requirements of the Rules not only in relation to  the  English
    language and qualification requirements but in failing to  provide  all
    that was required of him to show that he genuinely  has  access  to  at
    least �200,000 for  investment  purposes  to  be  used  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

29. As to the evidential  flexibility  issue  it  was  incumbent  upon  the
    respondent  to  seek  additional  information,  but  only  in   certain
    circumstances. Without seeking to define the policy here  that  applied
    at date of decision the  respondent  would  not  be  required  to  seek
    missing evidence if basic requirements as required by  the  Rules  have
    not been met. The current application is not  a  situation  where,  for
    instance, there is one bank statement missing from a  series  or  there
    have been minor errors or omissions made. It has not  been  shown  that
    evidence  exists  or  there  is  sufficient  reason  to  believe   that
    information exists which  upon  enquiry  would  provide  the  requisite
    evidence. The rules require the appellant to show that he had access to
    �200,000 as defined and what was produced  came  nowhere  near  showing
    that. It is not  a  minor  error  or  omission  or  a  situation  where
    clarification was required. Paragraph 245AA of the rules applied at the
    date of decision.  It  refers  to  documents  not  submitted  with  the
    application. As per the refusal letter the respondent  decided  not  to
    request  additional  documentation  or   exceptionally   consider   the
    application under paragraph  245AA  as  it  was  not  anticipated  that
    addressing the omission or error would lead to a grant leave.  I  agree
    and the First-tier Tribunal Judge came to the same conclusion.

Conclusions

30. The appellant does not succeed under the Rules.  Although I  find  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred for the reasons that I have set out
    earlier in this determination  I  do  not  find  that  the  errors  are
    material but if I am wrong about that then for the further reasons that
    I have set out above I would still dismiss this appeal for the  reasons
    given.

31. I note that the appellant's Statement of Additional Grounds refers to a
    breach of the appellant's Article 8 right to private and family life by
    the refusal of his application to remain in the United Kingdom and  any
    consequent decision to remove him.  The judge did not  deal  with  that
    aspect of the appeal and erred in that respect.  It is  said  that  the
    appellant has established a private life in the United Kingdom and  has
    invested a significant amount of time and money into his education  and
    business here.  The appellant's statement filed before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing refers to him having lived in the UK for more than two
    years. In addition to his business life he has  established  a  private
    life in this country and he  would  be  devastated  if  his  appeal  is
    dismissed and he is required to leave.

32. Undoubtedly the appellant will have built up a  private  life  that  is
    deserving of respect.  The decision interferes with that private  life.
    The decision is in accordance with the  law  and  is  for  one  of  the
    specified purposes, namely fair and firm immigration  control.   It  is
    for the respondent to show that the decision is  a  proportionate  one.
    There are no non-standard or particular features demonstrated that  the
    decision is anything other than reasonable and proportionate in all the
    circumstances.  The appellant has not been in the  United  Kingdom  for
    very long and had no expectation absent full compliance with the  Rules
    that he would be able  to  remain  here.  What  qualifications  he  has
    acquired may well benefit him in Pakistan.



Decision

33. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  stands  and  the  appeal  is
    dismissed. The judge did not deal with the Article 8 claim but  in  all
    the circumstances the appeal does not succeed on that ground either for
    the reasons given above.

34. I was not addressed on the issue of anonymity. No  anonymity  direction
    has been made previously  and  the  particular  circumstances  of  this
    appeal do not warrant such a direction being made.
