Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss C Gough, Home Office Presenting Officer

The correct approach to paragraph 21 of HC 510 invites consideration of  the
following matters:

     i. The price for acquisition of  a  business  should  make  commercial
        sense.  An exaggerated price or one which does not reflect  in  any
        way the true value of the business may lead to a legitimate enquiry
        as to the truth  of  the  transaction  or  the  intentions  of  the
        parties.
    ii. ii. A business plan must be realistic having regard to  the  nature
        of the enterprise. It is legitimate to ask further questions  where
        the projected turnover is substantially greater than that reflected
        in the accounts of the business being acquired.


   iii. Even where a business is not expected to be profitable in the short
        term, revenue generated may well  be  enough  to  meet  short  term
        liabilities and provide enough for the applicant's support.

    iv. It is important therefore to identify the  likely  liabilities  and
        what the applicant's personal needs are in order to see if they can
        be met out of cash flow or the initial investment. The test is  not
        whether the applicant is going to get a return  on  his  investment
        but whether what is projected is likely to enable the applicant  to
        pay the bills arising and meet his living expenses.

     v. A plan is what it says it is: a projection of how it is anticipated
        things will work out with the possibility of making adjustments  as
        the business gets under way. It is not a strait jacket.

    vi. In doubtful cases an  applicant's  previous  experience  will  help
        inform the decision- maker whether a projected turnover  is  likely
        to be achieved, but such experience is not a pre-requisite.


                              DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Mr Akinci is a national of Turkey, born 13 September 1990.  He  appeals
    with permission the decision of First-tier Tribunal judge  Alakija  who
    dismissed his appeal against the Secretary of  State's  decision  of  4
    July 2011 refusing to vary his leave to  remain.   He  had  applied  to
    establish himself in business  under  the  Turkey-  European  Community
    Association Agreement ("the Ankara Agreement").

 2. Mr Akinci proposed to buy a kebab takeaway business in Minehead and  in
    support  of  his  application  submitted  evidence  of   his   proposed
    investment including, unaudited accounts of the business for  the  year
    ending April 2011, a business plan and  a  rental  agreement.   He  had
    arrived in the United Kingdom as a visitor on a visa issued in Istanbul
    on 5 January 2011.  His application for further  leave  to  remain  was
    made on 13 June 2011.

 3. The Secretary of State gave  a  number  of  reasons  for  refusing  the
    application:

     i) The credibility of the application was undermined by the  price  he
        intended to  pay,  representing  approximately  the  annual  profit
        together with the rent he would be required to pay to  the  vendor.
        It  was  considered  the  purchase  price  (�12,000)  was   not   a
        proportionate amount  to  invest  in  comparison  to  the  turnover
        (�67,711).

    ii) The appellant had declared his job in  Turkey  to  be  that  of  an
        engine technician on his entry clearance application form,  however
        he relied on a CV showing that he had been involved in the catering
        field since leaving college in 2006.  This gave rise to the concern
        that the appellant was  not  qualified  to  operate  "a  busy  food
        takeaway business in the UK".

   iii) It was not accepted that the appellant's  English  language  skills
        were sufficient to undertake effective training or that he would be
        able to run such a business.

    iv) Certificates he relied on as evidence of  his  skills  from  Turkey
        were not evidence of recognised food industry certificates.

     v) There were doubts about the evidence produced  in  support  of  the
        appellant's planned investment.

 4. The judge heard evidence from both the appellant  and  the  vendor  and
    made these observations:

     i) It was clear the appellant had not undertaken any  in-depth  market
        research himself.

    ii) He would not take a wage from the business in its start up period.

   iii) He had very little idea of his business plan and his proposals  for
        increases in  staff  and  equipment  were  unrealistic  during  the
        current economic climate.

    iv) There was inconsistent evidence over the  appellant's  relationship
        to the vendor, Mr Altinok.

     v) The appellant had not come here with the intention of  staying  for
        only nine days.

    vi) The profit made in the previous year by the vendor was without  the
        increase in rent the appellant would be paying or the  increase  in
        other overheads and costs envisaged.

   vii) The business was not a viable proposition to support the  appellant
        who may have to rely on other employment or public funds.

  viii) The appellant had stated he would employ four people in addition to
        himself giving a salary bill of �60,000 which would turn the profit
        made by the vendor in the preceding year into a loss  unless  there
        was a substantial increase in turnover.

 5. The judge concluded with these remarks:

         "I do not accept the suggestion that the appellant should be  given
         12 months to see if he can make a go of the business  and  for  the
         decision to then be reviewed particularly when it is  obvious  from
         the start that it cannot succeed on the basis  of  the  information
         provided by the appellant himself."

6.    Ms Peterson relied  on  a  skeleton  argument  as  the  basis  of  her
    submissions.  It had been drafted by other  counsel  and  used  as  the
    application for permission to appeal.  It is argued that:

         i. The judge had failed to make relevant findings with reference to
             paragraph 21 of HC  510,  the  Immigration  Rule  relevant  to
             Ankara Agreement cases.

         ii.      The judge had misunderstood the effect of the  Rule  based
             on the evidence thar the appellant would  not  take  a  "wage"
             until the business settled down.  Para  21  does  not  require
             that a  person  must  support  himself  from  wages  from  the
             business, he should  be  able  to  support  himself  from  the
             profits of the business which may accrue  after  the  business
             has been in operation for some time.

         iii.      An  assessment  was  also  required  of  the  appellant's
             financial position including his accommodation arrangements in
             determining whether he was able  to  support  himself  without
             disguised employment.

         iv.      The  wrong  approach  was  taken  on  the  impact  of  the
             appellant's oral testimony as  to  the  number  of  people  he
             intended  to  employ  and  their  compensation  based  on  the
             accounts  for  the  preceding  year  rather  than  anticipated
             prospective future profits.

7.    The Secretary of State opposed the appeal in a r.24 response.   Before
    hearing from her we drew the parties' attention  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's instructions on how her staff  should  deal  with  applications
    under the Turkish EEC Association Agreement.

 8.   We announced our decision that the judge had made a material error  of
    law in the way in which he had considered the evidence before him.  His
    decision would be set aside and required to be re-made.   We  now  give
    our reasons for that conclusion.

9.    It is settled law that the 1972 Immigration Rules (HC 509 and HC  510)
    are the provisions applicable to Turkish  nationals  who  can  rely  on
    Article  41(1)  of  the  Additional  Protocol  to  the  EEC  -  Turkish
    Association Agreement in order to benefit from the  standstill  clause.
    These rules are considerably more favourable with respect to  migration
    for business purposes than those prevailing today: (see Savas (external
    relations) [2000] EUECJ C-37/98 and Oguz  (external  relations)  [2011]
    EUECJ Case C-186/10).

10.   HC 510 contains the Rules as to the practice to  be  followed  in  the
    administration of the Immigration Act 1971 for regulating control after
    entry.  Paragraph 21 is in these terms:

         "Businessmen and self-employed persons


         People admitted as visitors  may  apply  for  the  consent  of  the
         Secretary of State to their establishing themselves  here  for  the
         purpose of setting up in business, whether on their own account  or
         as partners in a new or existing business. Any such application  is
         to be considered on merits. Permission will depend on a  number  of
         factors, including evidence that the  applicant  will  be  devoting
         assets of his own to the business, proportional to his interest  in
         it, that he will be able to bear his share of any  liabilities  the
         business may incur, and that his  share  of  its  profits  will  be
         sufficient to support him and any dependants. The applicant's  part
         in the business must not amount to  disguised  employment,  and  it
         must be clear that he will not  have  to  supplement  his  business
         activities by employment for which a work permit is required. Where
         the  applicant  intends  to  join  an  existing  business,  audited
         accounts should be produced to establish  its  financial  position,
         together with a written statement of the terms on which  he  is  to
         enter into it; evidence should be sought that he will  be  actively
         concerned with its running and that there is a genuine need for his
         services and investment.  Where  the  application  is  granted  the
         applicant's stay may be extended for a period of up to  12  months,
         on a condition restricting his freedom to take employment. A person
         admitted as a businessman in the first instance may be  granted  an
         appropriate extension of stay if the conditions set out  above  are
         still satisfied at the end of the period for which he was  admitted
         initially."

11.    Although  the  Secretary  of  State  expressed  concerns  about   the
    credibility of the appellant,  there  has  been  no  challenge  to  the
    application on the grounds of abuse of  rights  which  might  otherwise
    disentitle the appellant to rely on Community law and  the  substantive
    rights arising under  the  Ankara  Agreement.  It  is  clear  from  the
    decision in Oguz that the concept of abuse of rights is  a  narrow  one
    defined according to Community law principles, and it  is  not  engaged
    simply by virtue of the fact that claimant was admitted as a visitor.

12.   The issue at the  heart  of  this  appeal  is  the  viability  of  the
    business.  This is largely a matter  of  objective  evaluation  of  the
    business plan, but credibility may  be  an  issue  as  to  whether  the
    claimant really intends to  do  what  is  proposed  in  the  plan.  The
    Tribunal has recently considered how to assess cases relying  on  plans
    prepared in identical terms for a wide variety of applicants. In Baylan
    (Turkish ECAA - "identical" applications) [2012] UKUT 83 (IAC) the head
    note reads:

         "In dealing with Turkish ECAA cases, decision makers must  bear  in
         mind the guidance given in EK (Ankara  Agreement  -  1972  Rules  -
         Construction) Turkey [2010] UKUT 425 (IAC).
      Identicality or near identicality in Turkish ECAA applications is  not
         of itself a reason to find an applicant cannot  succeed.   However,
         it is apparent from the wording of paragraph 21 of HC 510  and  the
         underlying objective of the Association Agreement that the business
         plan must be shown to be viable in the context  of  an  applicant's
         own personal circumstances."

13.   EK (Ankara Agreement - 1972 Rules - Construction) Turkey  [2010]  UKUT
    425 (IAC) has this head note:

         "1.      There is nothing in the 1972 Immigration  Rules  (HC  510)
             that provides that a person who cannot come within one of  the
             categories of the  Immigration  Rules  is  to  be  refused  an
             extension of stay for that reason alone.  Rule 4 set  out  the
             'main categories' of people who may be given leave recognising
             the  possibility  that  there   are   other   categories   not
             specifically set out that can be dealt with on a discretionary
             basis.  Accordingly it was open to the Home Office to grant an
             extension of stay as  a  businesswoman  to  somebody  who  had
             entered as an au pair.  The finding in OT (Turkey) [2010] UKUT
             330 (IAC) that HC 510 reckon that  in  switching  to  business
             status by anyone  other  than  a  visitor  is  not  considered
             correct.  (See also now LE (Turkey) [2010] CSOH 153).

         2. Paragraph 28 of HC 510 does not require a person  who  had  been
             given leave as a businessman to demonstrate as a pre-condition
             for the exercise of discretion that in each  or  any  year  in
             which they had been given leave  in  that  capacity  they  had
             complied with the particular  requirements  of  paragraph  21.
             Those requirements are directly relevant  only  to  the  first
             application for permission to remain and the  first  extension
             of stay.

         3. There is no  precise  code  in  HC  510  distinguishing  between
             maintenance  and  accommodation  and  precluding  third  party
             contributions to living expenses."

14.   Paragraph 21 covers two sets of circumstances.   The  first  is  where
    someone proposes to set themselves up in business  and  the  second  is
    where it is proposed they will become partners in  a  new  or  existing
    business.  The Rule is expressed in broad terms in the  context  of  an
    approach that any application  is  to  be  considered  on  its  merits.
    Permission is stated to depend on a number of factors which include:

         i. evidence that the applicant will be devoting assets of  his  own
             to the business, proportional to his interest in it;

         ii.      that he will be able to bear his share of any  liabilities
             the business may incur;

         iii.     that his share  of  its  profits  will  be  sufficient  to
             support him and any dependants;

         iv.      the applicant's part in the business must  not  amount  to
             disguised employment;

         v. and it must be clear that he will not  have  to  supplement  his
             business activities by employment for which a work  permit  is
             required.

    There are additional requirements where an applicant intends to join an
    existing business:

         vi.      audited accounts  should  be  produced  to  establish  its
             financial position

         v. together with a written statement of the terms on which he is to
             enter into it;

         vi.      evidence  should  be  sought  that  he  will  be  actively
             concerned with its running, and

         vii.     that there  was  a  genuine  need  for  his  services  and
             investment.

15.   In the appeal before us the appellant proposed to acquire  a  business
    and therefore the factors to be considered are  those  set  at  (i)-(v)
    above.

16.   As the Upper Tribunal observed in EK:

         "23.     In  1973  the  Rules  themselves  were  an  open  textured
             exercise in discretion in  the  round  having  regard  to  the
             general policy and particular factors identified; so  was  the
             practice in applying them...

          24.     ... It was certainly the case in 1972 and for a number  of
             years thereafter  that  the  Home  Office  recognised  that  a
             business often needed some time to turn a profit and losses in
             the early years were not inconsistent with the  business  that
             met the policy and purpose of the Rules in general.  The  case
             was always considered in the  round.   In  cases  of  doubt  a
             further extension of limited leave was often given".

17.    The  Secretary  of  State's  understanding  of  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 21 is set out in her extensive instructions to her  staff  in
    section 6 of the Immigration Directorate Instructions.   These  do  not
    have the force of law, but nevertheless they have a  legitimate  impact
    in that it would be wrong for a judge to reach a decision in  ignorance
    of them (see ZH (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 8;  [2009]  Imm  AR
    450).


18.   Two aspects of these instructions require comment.  At 4.3.2 it is
    stated:


         "4.3.2.  Realistic business proposal

              A business plan or clear statement of intention  setting  out
              the business proposal and what the applicant will actually be
              doing is essential. This should include the following:

                  o An executive summary of the business proposal
                  o Outline of marketing and sales strategy
                  o Outline of operations - business premises to be used,
                    any production facilities, IT systems etc
                  o Timetable for establishment
                  o Financial forecasts including;


                    -  detailed breakdown of set-up costs of the intended
                       business
                    -   proper  understanding  of  practical  and  financial
                       requirements for establishment in the UK
                    -  projections regarding performance over the  first  12
                       months  of  operation  which  takes  account  of  all
                       potential    expenses     (such     as     overheads,
                       administration, and marketing) and which convincingly
                       demonstrates a reasonable chance that profits will be
                       sufficient  to  maintain  the   applicant   and   any
                       dependants over that time.

              It is important  that  if  required  any  applicant  is  able
              convincingly to demonstrate an understanding of  any  written
              evidence submitted on his behalf and will be able to  justify
              the projected figures given above.

              When, for example, it is apparent that  the  individual  does
              not match up to the profile suggested by a pro forma business
              plan which may have been prepared by another party, it  would
              be appropriate  to  discount  such  a  plan  in  the  overall
              assessment of the application. An  inability  to  demonstrate
              understanding of the plan would cast  doubt  on  whether  the
              applicant could be expected in practice to put it into place.
              However it would not be impossible to demonstrate  compliance
              with the rules when an application is prepared in conjunction
              with another party and contains similarities to  other  plans
              previously or similarly submitted."


19.   Whilst the  suggested  evidence  to  be  provided  in  support  of  an
    application is useful as a means to satisfying the Secretary  of  State
    of the  application,  the  expectation  that  the  applicant  "is  able
    convincingly to demonstrate an understanding of any  written  evidence"
    sets the standard too high and does not represent the approach  applied
    in 1972 which is the acid test. An applicant may have a clear  idea  of
    what he plans to do but  may  not  have  sufficient  sophistication  to
    explain the way in which his ideas have been expressed  by  a  business
    adviser. He does not have to be a financial expert and  in  a  case  of
    doubt, clarification can be provided if needed and the adviser could be
    called to give evidence if matters are in doubt.


20.   The second point relates to the instructions regarding the ability  of
    an applicant to bear his  share  of  any  liabilities  and  to  support
    himself.  Para. 4.4.2 includes the observation:


             "Evidence  that  the  applicant  can  bear  his/her  share   of
         liabilities


             ...Liability will also be linked to  the  level  of  financial
             risk that the applicant takes by setting up and  investing  in
             the business. Individuals who risk their  own  money  by,  for
             example, buying assets needed for  the  job  and  bearing  the
             running costs and paying for overheads and large quantities of
             materials, are deemed to be taking a financial risk. Liability
             arises from the possibility that these investments will not be
             matched by the level of profit made. Financial risk could also
             take the form of quoting a fixed price for  a  job,  with  the
             consequent liability of bearing the additional  costs  if  the
             job overruns.


             Of relevance to being able to bear  liabilities  will  be  the
             value of the business's fixed  assets,  the  amount  of  money
             invested in the business and its expected/actual turnover  and
             profit, other funds available to the applicant and  the  level
             of business insurance cover that the applicant has in place.


             Whilst debt represents a liability it is not always  necessary
             for an applicant to be able to show that he can meet this debt
             instantaneously, particularly if  the  debt  is  a  relatively
             small amount in the context  of  the  business.  It  would  be
             acceptable for the applicant to show that his/her business  is
             likely to eradicate the debt from profits of the  business  in
             proceeding years.",


         and at 4.4.3:


             "Evidence of sufficient profits to support applicant and any
              dependents


             The income required for an applicant to realistically maintain
             and accommodate themselves and any dependants without recourse
             to employment should be assessed on  a  case  by  case  basis,
             taking any relevant factors into account, and bearing in  mind
             that income derived from  other  sources,  including  benefits
             (see section 4.4.3.1), should not be included.  This  includes
             anything earned by dependants of the primary applicant.


             Applicants  need  not  have  generated  the  level  of  profit
             required to maintain and accommodate  themselves  solely  from
             the business throughout the first two  years  of  their  stay,
             while the business was being set up  (although  they  must  be
             able to demonstrate how, in the absence of such profits,  they
             have maintained themselves in that time  without  recourse  to
             employment), but the decision maker must be satisfied  that  a
             sufficient level can be generated consistently in  the  future
             in order for further leave to be granted.


             ..."


    It  is  significant  that  the   Secretary   of   State   realistically
    acknowledges that businesses may not turn a profit immediately and this
    reflects a valid factor in assessing any plan.


21.   In our view the correct approach to paragraph 21  of  HC  510  invites
    consideration of the following matters:

           i.  The  price  for  acquisition  of  a  business  should   make
              commercial sense.  An exaggerated price or one which does not
              reflect in any way the true value of the business may lead to
              a legitimate enquiry as to the truth of  the  transaction  or
              the intentions of the parties.


          ii. A business plan must be realistic having regard to the nature
              of the enterprise. It is legitimate to ask further  questions
              where the projected turnover is  substantially  greater  than
              that reflected in the accounts of a business being acquired.

         iii. Even where a business is not expected to be profitable in the
              short term, revenue generated may  well  be  enough  to  meet
              short term liabilities and provide enough for the applicant's
              support.

          iv. It is important therefore to identify the likely  liabilities
              and what the applicant's personal needs are in order  to  see
              if  they  can  be  met  out  of  cash  flow  or  the  initial
              investment. The test is not whether the applicant is going to
              get a return on his investment but whether what is  projected
              is likely to enable the applicant to pay  the  bills  arising
              and meet his living expenses.

           v. A plan is what it says it is:  a  projection  of  how  it  is
              anticipated things will work out with the possibility  making
              adjustments as the business gets  under  way.  It  is  not  a
              strait jacket.

          vi. In doubtful cases an  applicant's  previous  experience  will
              help inform the decision maker whether a  projected  turnover
              is likely to be achieved, but such experience is not  a  pre-
              requisite.

22.   With these observations in mind we turn to  the  determination  before
    us.  The judge's principal finding was that the business  as  envisaged
    by the appellant in his oral evidence would not be a viable proposition
    sufficient to support him with the consequential finding that he  might
    have to resort to reliance on employment or public funds.

23.    Two  aspects  of  the  case  particularly  influenced  him   in   his
    conclusions.  The first was an increase in the rent the appellant would
    need to pay by virtue of the vendor  granting  him  a  sub-lease.   The
    uplift was to be from �5,880 to �7,200.  In the context of the turnover
    recorded  in  the  accounts  (�67,711)  and  that  anticipated  by  the
    appellant in his first year of  trading  (�104,400),  this  was  hardly
    material.

24.   The second aspect related to the anticipated salary  bill.   According
    to the projected profit and loss set out in the business plan,  in  the
    first year the appellant anticipated a net profit of �14,341  based  on
    the above turnover and a payroll  of  �26,472.   A  breakdown  of  this
    provides for a payment to the appellant per annum  of  �9,000  and  the
    balance to three other members of staff.  According to  the  record  of
    proceedings the appellant was cross-examined in some detail.  As to how
    many staff he intended to employ, he answered that it  was  then  three
    but he wanted to employ two more.   When  asked  how  much  each  would
    receive he indicated �15,000.  The Presenting  Officer  put  the  total
    therefore  at  �60,000.  It  is  not  clear  how  he  arrived  at  this
    arithmetic.  When challenged over this additional  cost  the  appellant
    acknowledged he could  make  a  loss  but  this  followed  the  earlier
    questions in which the appellant had responded  that  the  increase  in
    staff would help the business grow.

25.   The judge at [19] to  [21]  applied  the  additional  staff  projected
    staff costs to the historic figures and made  no  finding  whether  the
    increase in staff would result in a substantial increase  in  turnover.
    This was an error. What the judge should have  done  was  to  take  the
    projections in the business plan and  then  decide  whether  they  were
    realistic having regard to the historic figures.  Thereafter he  should
    have considered whether the further expansion plans identified  by  the
    appellant in cross-examination would result in an even greater increase
    in profit to that originally envisaged.

26.   The judge also erred in failing to identify what funds  the  appellant
    would need for his support. It is difficult to see how there  could  be
    an informed assessment of the ability of the business  to  provide  for
    the appellant's support without knowing  what  those  costs  would  be.
    There was evidence before him that the appellant was living  rent  free
    with a friend and could have recourse to his business to feed  himself.
    His outgoings were thus likely  to  be  very  modest.  The  judge  also
    appears to have given weight at [15] to the proposition advanced by the
    presenting officer that the fact that the appellant was  not  intending
    to draw a salary in the initial period meant  he  could  not  meet  the
    rules. As we have explained this is not a correct analysis.

27.   We conclude that the judge made material errors  in  his  approach  to
    the assessment of evidence before  him  and  failed  to  take  material
    matters into  account.   We  therefore  set  aside  the  decision  that
    requires re-making.

28.   It should have been obvious to the appellant and  his  advisers  that,
    once permission to appeal had been granted, up to date evidence  as  to
    how the business was proceeding would have been highly material to  the
    eventual outcome. If the business was expanding according to plan  then
    the judge's pessimistic conclusions may well be shown to be unfounded.

29.   Despite a clear indication in the directions that the  Upper  Tribunal
    would seek to re-make the decision without a further hearing  (in  such
    an eventuality), there was no new evidence before us. This was all  the
    more surprising in the light of the information  Ms  Peterson  gave  us
    instructions that the first year accounts were ready and  were  helpful
    to the appellant.

30.   Our preference was to re-make the decision forthwith, however we  were
    unable to do so by the failure to serve  the  relevant  evidence.   The
    appellant has not been well- served by his advisers.  He  will  now  to
    have to face the costs of an additional hearing and consequent delay.

31.   It is not the ordinary practice of the Upper Tribunal to  remit  cases
    to the First-tier Tribunal. In the great majority of cases, no  further
    disputed evidence is needed if decisions are to be re-made and if  such
    evidence is served timeously, the Tribunal will normally be able to  go
    on and consider it. This is  not  possible  in  the  present  case  and
    inquiries have revealed that the First-tier hearing centre will be able
    to list and determine this appeal much more speedily than the state  of
    the Upper Tribunal's lists permits. We have particular  regard  to  the
    over-riding objective of efficient disposal of  appeals  and  also  the
    fact that the issue in dispute is the central question of fact  in  the
    appeal that both parties may want to explore.

32.   In these circumstances we conclude that the appropriate course in  all
    the circumstances is for the appeal to be remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for there to be a  careful  assessment  of  all  the  evidence
    relied on by the appellant if the  matter  remains  disputed.   If  the
    appellant has up to date information as to the progress of his business
    he should serve it promptly on the respondent. He would also be advised
    to send in up  to  date  information  about  his  living  expenses  and
    resources.

33.  We therefore set aside the decision and as indicated  above  remit  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal at Newport for the decision to be re-
    made in accordance with this determination.

Directions

34.   We make the following further directions:

    (i)    The appeal will be heard at Newport at 10:00am on Monday 23 July
         2012 with a time estimate of 2 hours

    (ii)   Not later than 10 days from the date of the sending out of these
         directions the appellant and all his representatives  are  directed
         to ensure that any additional evidence on which they wish  to  rely
         is served on the respondent and a copy sent to First-tier Tribunal.

   iii) The appellant should inform  the  First-tier  Tribunal  whether  he
        needs the services of an interpreter within the same period  of  10
        days.

      iv) The respondent should respond to any material served on it within
          a reasonable time before the hearing.

       v) If the appeal is no longer opposed or either party concludes that
          the time estimate should be significantly varied  the  First-tier
          Tribunal must be informed promptly.
