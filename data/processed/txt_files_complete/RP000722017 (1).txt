   DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 39 OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL)
                                 RULES 2008


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Somalia. He appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ("FtT) against a decision  dated  19  May  2017  to  refuse  a
    protection and human rights claim, based on a decision  to  deport  him
    for criminal offending. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Howard  ("the  FtJ")
    dismissed his appeal on all grounds after a hearing on 27 June 2017.

 2. Permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  the  FtJ  having  been
    granted, his appeal came before me.

 3. By consent, the parties agreed the following:

      (i)    the FtJ erred in law in his decision in terms of a failure  to
         consider, amongst other things, the issue of cessation  of  refugee
         status  (Article  1(C)5),  the  Immigration   Rules   relevant   to
         deportation,  and  exclusion  from  humanitarian  protection  (para
         339D(iii), raised in the respondent's decision letter);

      (ii)   that the FtJ's decision should be set aside; and

      (iii)  that the appeal should be remitted to the FtT for a hearing de
         novo before a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other  than  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Howard.

4.   Having heard the parties, and  considering  rule  39  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, I make a consent  order  in  the
    terms expressed in [3] above, considering it appropriate to do so,  and
    thus remitting the appeal to the FtT for a hearing  de  novo  before  a
    First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge  Howard,
    with no findings of fact preserved.

5.   The consent order is as contained herein, no  separate  document  being
    required.









Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek                            18/09/17
