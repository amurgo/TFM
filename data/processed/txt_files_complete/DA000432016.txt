Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The Secretary of State for the Home Department (Appellant)  appeals
         against the decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  M  S
         Emerton, promulgated on 03 October 2016, in which  he  allowed  the
         appeal of DM (the Respondent), against the Appellant's decision  of
         07 December 2015 to make a deportation order against  him  pursuant
         to the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  (the
         2006 Regulations).

Background

      2. The Respondent is a national of Lithuania born on 09 November 1982.
         He claims to have entered the United Kingdom in September 2007. The
         Respondent's wife, also a Lithuanian national, entered  the  United
         Kingdom in October 2005 under EEA free movement provisions. She has
         lived in the UK continuously since 2005 exercising her  EEA  rights
         as a worker.  She  became  a  British  citizen  in  May  2013.  The
         Respondent married his partner on 5 August 2013.

      3. The Respondent and his wife have 2 children; a daughter born in the
         UK in January 2007 and a son born in the UK on  28  February  2014.
         Their son was born a British citizen and their  daughter  became  a
         British citizen on 17 February 2016.

      4. In  August  2009  the  Respondent  was  convicted  for  failing  to
         surrender to custody  and  fined  �20.  In  December  2009  he  was
         convicted of 4 counts of theft and received a community  order  for
         12 months with an unpaid  work  requirement  of  250  hours.  On  5
         January  2015  the  Respondent  was  convicted  of   possessing   a
         prohibited weapon and received a 12 months  conditional  discharge.
         On 8 June 2015 the Respondent  was  convicted  of  possession  with
         intent to supply a  class  B  drug  and  received  a  of  15  month
         custodial sentence.

      5. As a result of his convictions the Appellant decided to the  deport
         the Respondent under  Regulations  19(3)(b)  and  21  of  the  2006
         Regulations. The Appellant was not satisfied that the Claimant  had
         attained permanent  residence  under  Regulation  15  of  the  2006
         Regulations. No specific consideration was given by  the  Appellant
         as to whether the  Respondent  qualified  for  enhanced  protection
         under Regulation 21(4) (10 years residence), presumably because, on
         his account,  he  only  entered  the  UK  in  2007.  The  Appellant
         considered that the Respondent had  been  convicted  of  a  serious
         drugs offence  and  that  he  had  a  propensity  to  reoffend  and
         presented a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the
         public to justify his deportation on  public  policy  grounds.  The
         Appellant was not satisfied there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship between the Respondent and his wife or  children,  and
         in any event maintained that any such relationships could  continue
         either in Lithuania or through remote forms of  communication.  The
         Appellant additionally considered whether the decision would breach
         Article 8 ECHR and took into account  the  relevant  provisions  of
         s.117C of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  (the
         2002 Act) and s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act
         2009.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      6. In his summary of the Respondent's immigration  history  the  judge
         noted that there had been no previous application by the Respondent
         for a residence document of any sort.  The  judge  found  that  the
         Respondent's oral evidence to be  reasonably  credible  as  it  was
         largely corroborated by his wife and  other  witnesses.  The  judge
         noted the Respondent's claim to have engaged in some employment but
         that for much of the time he was at home he was looking  after  the
         children whilst his wife worked. The judge was satisfied  that  the
         Respondent was in a genuine relationship with his wife and that  he
         had a genuine relationship with his children. The judge  noted  the
         Respondent's claim that he qualified for  permanent  residence  and
         the submission made by the Respondent's representative that he  met
         the requirements of Article 15(1)(a) of the 2006 Regulations.

      7. At [24] the judge concluded that, between September 2007 and 1  May
         2013,  the  Respondent  was  in  a  durable  relationship  with  an
         unmarried partner who was a qualified person. The judge noted  that
         for a period of 5� years the Respondent was an EFM and that he  had
         never been a family member of an EEA national.

      8. From [25] to [27] the judge considered whether the Respondent  fell
         within the terms of Regulation 15(1)(a). The  judge  was  satisfied
         that the Respondent was "an EEA national who has resided in the  UK
         in accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period  of  5
         years." This was because the Respondent was, in  the  view  of  the
         judge, an EFM of another EEA national exercising treaty  rights  in
         the UK for a continuous  period  of  over  5  years  [27].  As  the
         applicant was undoubtedly an EFM, a category of person  defined  in
         the 2006 Regulations, and had been residing in the UK as  such  for
         over 5 years, in the view of the judge he met the  requirements  of
         Regulation 15(1)(a).

      9. Having found that the Respondent had acquired  permanent  residence
         the judge proceeded to determine the appeal on the basis  that  the
         Respondent could only be removed on "imperative grounds  of  public
         policy or public security" (at  [28]).  The  judge  concluded  that
         there  were  no  such  imperative  grounds  ([29]  &  [31])  having
         considered evidence  relating  to  the  Respondents  rehabilitation
         [30].

     10. At [32] the judge stated,

             "In the circumstances, there is little to be gained by  making
             exhaustive  findings  or  conclusions  in   the   alternative.
             However, to summarise the position, even if  the  [Respondent]
             would fall to be considered under  Regulation  21(5),  without
             qualifying for the  enhanced  protection  of  eligibility  for
             permanent residence under Regulation 21(3), I  agree  with  Mr
             Burrett the evidence does not suggest  that  the  [Respondent]
             would be a "genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat",
             and  that  the  issues   of   proportionality   suggest   that
             deportation would be excessive."

     11. The judge then considered that it would be a  breach  of  the  duty
         under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
         2009 and disproportionate to split up the family  and  require  the
         Respondent to live apart from his wife and children, or  to  expect
         the children to upend themselves from the life they knew in the  UK
         [32]. The judge finally concluded that the Respondent's deportation
         would have an unduly harsh impact  on  his  relationship  with  his
         children and that it  would  be  unduly  harsh,  having  regard  to
         section 55 and Article 8  case  law  such  as  ZH  (Tanzania)  (FC)
         (Appellant)  v  Secretary  of  State  for   the   Home   Department
         (Respondent) [2011] UKSC 4, to split them from their father [33].

The Grounds of Appeal and the submissions before the Upper Tribunal

     12. Permission was granted on the basis that  the  judge  had  arguably
         misdirected himself by applying the higher threshold of "imperative
         grounds" when the Respondent  could,  at  best,  only  qualify  for
         permanent residence. Permission was also granted on the basis  that
         the Respondent did not in  fact  qualify  for  permanent  residence
         because he could not meet the requirements of  Regulation  15(1)(a)
         on the basis of his residence as an EFM in  the  absence  of  being
         issued with a residence card. Permission was  additionally  granted
         on the basis that there was no finding that deportation would split
         up the family as there was no record that the family asserted  that
         they were unable or unwilling to relocate to Lithuania.

     13. Ms Mallick provided a lengthy skeleton argument at the hearing  and
         amplified through oral argument  her  argument  for  resisting  the
         Appellant's grounds of appeal. It was submitted that, as  a  result
         of his durable relationship, the Respondent  would  have  qualified
         for permanent residence, and that  the  judge  was  right  to  have
         applied the 'higher imperative test'. Even if  the  judge  was  not
         entitled to apply the 'higher imperative test' the  judge  did  not
         err in law because he went on to consider the serious threshold  at
         paragraph 32 of his  decision  and  his  error  was  therefore  not
         material. It was further submitted that the Respondent  would  have
         qualified for permanent residence because he was either working  or
         a jobseeker within  the  terms  of  Regulation  6(2)  of  the  2006
         Regulations. It was alternatively submitted that the Respondent had
         resided in the UK as the primary carer of an EEA national  but  and
         that he was entitled to a derivative right of residence pursuant to
         Regulation 15A of the 2006 Regulations. It  was  finally  submitted
         that the judge's assessment under Article 8 ECHR was free from  any
         legal error.

Discussion

     14. In determining whether the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         contains a material legal error it is  necessary  to  consider  the
         relevant sections of the 2006 Regulations.

     15. Under Regulation 15(1)(a) of the 2006 Regulations an  EEA  national
         who has resided in the United Kingdom "... in accordance with these
         Regulations" for a continuous period of 5 years shall  acquire  the
         right to reside in the UK permanently.

     16. Regulation 13(1), dealing with initial rights of residence, states,
         so far as material:

             '(1) An EEA national is  entitled  to  reside  in  the  United
             Kingdom for a period not exceeding three months  beginning  on
             the date on  which  he  is  admitted  to  the  United  Kingdom
             provided that he holds  a  valid  national  identity  card  or
             passport issued by an EEA State.'

     17. Regulation 14 of the 2006 Regulations deals with extended rights of
         residence. This states:

             '(1) A qualified person is entitled to reside  in  the  United
             Kingdom for so long as he remains a qualified person.

             (2)  A family member of a qualified  person  residing  in  the
             United Kingdom under paragraph (1) or of an EEA national  with
             a permanent right of residence under Regulation 15 is entitled
             to reside in the United Kingdom for so long as he remains  the
             family member of the qualified person or EEA national.

             (3)  A family member who has retained the right  of  residence
             is entitled to reside in the United Kingdom for so long as  he
             remains  a  family  member  who  has  retained  the  right  of
             residence.

             (4)  A right to reside under this Regulation is in addition to
             any right a person may have to reside in  the  United  Kingdom
             under Regulation 13 or 15.

             (5)  A person who otherwise satisfies  the  criteria  in  this
             Regulation will not be entitled to a right to  reside  in  the
             United Kingdom under this Regulation where  the  Secretary  of
             State or an immigration officer has made a decision under-

                  (a)  Regulation 19(3)(b), 20(1), 20A(1) or 23A; or

                  (b)  Regulation 21B(2)  (not  including  such  a  decision
                  taken on the basis of Regulation 21B(1)(a) or (b)),  where
                  that decision was taken in the preceding twelve months.'

     18. A  'family  member'  under  the  2006  Regulations  is  defined  in
         Regulation 7(1) and includes a person's spouse  or  civil  partner,
         direct descendants under the age of 21, dependent direct  relatives
         in the ascending line, or "a person who is to  be  treated  as  the
         family member of that other person under paragraph (3)." Regulation
         7(3) states:

             'Subject to paragraph (4), a person who is an extended  family
             member and has been  issued  with  an  EEA  family  permit,  a
             registration certificate or a residence card shall be  treated
             as the family member of the relevant EEA national for as  long
             as he continues to satisfy the conditions in Regulation  8(2),
             (3), (4) or (5) in relation  to  that  EEA  national  and  the
             permit, certificate or card has not ceased to be valid or been
             revoked.'

     19. Finally, Regulation 8 of the 2006 Regulations defines  an  Extended
         Family Member' (EFM).

             '(1) In these Regulations "extended  family  member"  means  a
             person who is not a family member of  an  EEA  national  under
             Regulation  7(1)(a),  (b)  or  (c)  and  who   satisfies   the
             conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

             ...

             (5)  A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if the
             person is the partner of an EEA national (other than  a  civil
             partner) and can prove to the decision maker that he is  in  a
             durable relationship with the EEA national.'

     20. It is not in dispute that the Respondent  and  the  person  who  is
         currently  his  wife  have  been  in  a  genuine   and   subsisting
         relationship since about September 2006. The Respondent permanently
         came to the UK in September 2007. His wife became a British citizen
         on 1 May 2013.  Although  the  Respondent  resided  in  the  United
         Kingdom between September 2007 and  May  2013  as  an  EFM,  it  is
         abundantly clear from the above recitation of the 2006  Regulations
         (in particular Regulations 13  &  14)  that  he  did  not  have  an
         extended right of residence. An extended right of residence is only
         acquired by a qualified person or the family member of a  qualified
         person. The Respondent does not meet the  requirements  of  'family
         member' in Regulation 7. He has therefore never resided in  the  UK
         as a family member of a qualified person. He only  had  an  initial
         right of residence pursuant to Regulation 13 for 3 months. Although
         he claims to have engaged in some work  he  has,  on  his  account,
         mostly stayed at home and looked after the children.  There  is  no
         evidence identified by the judge indicating the periods of time  he
         was working, and the periods of time he was looking for employment.
         There was therefore no evidential basis upon which the judge  could
         have conclude that the Appellant was exercising his  treaty  rights
         as a worker and a work-seeker (a submission that was never, in  any
         event, made to the First-tier Tribunal judge). The  Respondent  has
         not therefore resided  in  the  UK  in  accordance  with  the  2006
         Regulations for a continuous period of 5 years. Had he been  issued
         with  an  EEA  family  permit,  a  registration  certificate  or  a
         residence card in compliance with Regulation  7(3)  then  he  would
         have been  treated  as  the  family  member  of  his  partner.  The
         Respondent was never however issued with any such  document.  As  a
         result the judge  erred  in  concluding  that  the  Respondent  had
         acquired permanent residence.

     21. The judge compounded his legal errors by applying the highest level
         of  protection  to  the  Respondent.  Regulation  21  of  the  2006
         Regulations concerns  decisions  taken  on  public  policy,  public
         security and public health grounds. Regulation 21(3) states that  a
         relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a  person  with  a
         permanent right of residence under Regulation 15 except on  serious
         grounds of public policy or public security, and  Regulation  21(4)
         states, inter alia, that a  relevant  decision  may  not  be  taken
         except on imperative grounds of public security in  respect  of  an
         EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous
         period of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision. On  no
         view can the Respondent be said to have resided in the  UK  for  10
         years. He entered the UK in  September  2007.  The  decision  under
         appeal was taken on 7 December 2015.  The  Respondent  on  his  own
         evidence had not been residing in the UK for a continuous period of
         at least 10 years prior to the date.

     22. There is no merit in the written submission made by Ms Mallick that
         the Respondent was entitled to  a  derivative  right  of  residence
         because, at the date of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal,
         he was not the primary carer of an EEA national. He was the  father
         of 2 British nationals. On no view of the 2006 Regulations did  the
         Respondent attain a permanent  right  of  residence  through  being
         entitled to a derivative right of residence.

     23. Ms Mallick submitted that even if the judge had mistakenly  applied
         the wrong levels of protection in Regulation 21(3) and (4), he  was
         entitled to find, as he did at paragraph 32,  that  the  Respondent
         did not constitute a "genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
         threat." This conclusion however is  insufficiently  reasoned.  The
         judge has not explained why someone in the  Respondent's  position,
         who has a number of recently serious convictions, the last of which
         involved the supply of  illegal  drugs,  does  not  constitute  the
         requisite threat. As  the  judge  indicates  at  the  beginning  of
         paragraph 32, he has not made "exhaustive findings". Given that the
         Respondent's children  and  wife  are  now  British  citizens,  the
         Respondent could only be successful in his appeal  under  the  2006
         Regulations if he was able to  demonstrate  that  he  had  achieved
         permanent residence, which he has failed to do.

     24. Ms Mallick submitted that the judge's  conclusions  in  respect  of
         Article 8 ECHR were sustainable and that even if he had committed a
         material legal error in respect of his assessment  under  the  2006
         Regulations, the judge's decision could be maintained on the  basis
         of his finding that the Appellant met the requirements  of  section
         117C(5) of the 2002 Act.

     25. There is no merit in Ms Mallick's submission. At paragraph  33  the
         judge concluded that the deportation would be "unduly harsh" on the
         Respondent's partner and  children.  The  judge  however  fails  to
         support this conclusion with  anything  approaching  the  requisite
         degree of reasoning. There is very limited assessment of the impact
         on the Respondent's children, and no reference has been made to the
         strong public interest factors that  need  to  be  considered  when
         determining 'undue harshness'.

     26. For these reasons I am entirely satisfied that the decision of  the
         First-tier Tribunal is vitiated by material errors of law.  In  the
         absence of sufficiently detailed findings of fact it is appropriate
         for this appeal to be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal, all
         issues open, to be considered afresh by a judge  other  than  judge
         Emerton.



Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by a material error of law.

The matter will be remitted for a full fresh hearing at Taylor House  before
a judge other than judge of the First-tier Tribunal M S Emerton.

with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
