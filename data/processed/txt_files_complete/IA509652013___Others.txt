For the Appellant:     Mr Afzal (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen (Home Office Presenting Officer)



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first-named appellant (hereinafter referred to as  the  appellant),
    born July 24, 1964 is a citizen of Nigeria. He  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  on  September  13,  2013.  The
    remaining appellants are his wife and  children  and  they  applied  to
    remain as wife/children of a Tier 1 (General)  migrant.  The  appellant
    had originally come to the United Kingdom  as  a  student  having  been
    granted leave to enter on September  21,  2007.  He  was  then  granted
    further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until October 20,
    2013. The respondent rejected these applications on November  15,  2013
    under paragraph 245CA of the Immigration Rules, as  the  appellant  did
    not satisfy the requirement of paragraph 245CA(b) and  Appendix  A.  At
    the same time a decision was taken to remove them under Section  47  of
    the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  on  November  29,
    2013. On March 18, 2014 Judge of the First  Tier  Tribunal  Lloyd-Smith
    (hereinafter referred to  as  the  "FtTJ")  heard  their  appeals.  She
    refused all of their appeals under the Immigration Rules and article  8
    ECHR in a determination promulgated on March 19, 2014.

 3. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal on April 2, 2014 and  on  April
    16, 2014 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Osborne granted permission to
    appeal finding it arguable the FtTJ had possibly erred in her  approach
    to assessing the question of whether the appellant had a profitable and
    viable business.

 4. The appellant attended the hearing before me and was represented by  Mr
    Afzal.

    SUBMISSIONS


 5. Mr Afzal adopted his grounds of appeal and submitted:


      a. The FtTJ should have given the appellant some leeway because he had
         been acting in person when he submitted the  applications.  He  did
         not  appreciate  he  had  to  specify  the  period  he  wished  the
         respondent to consider.  He  did  produce  ample  evidence  of  his
         business  and  he  had,  with  the  leave  to  appeal  application,
         submitted evidence of the accountant's qualification.


      b. The FtTJ erred because she failed to have regard to  the  fact  the
         appellant's wife helped him run the business.


      c. The FtTJ had erred in finding that the appellant had only submitted
         a couple of invoices when in fact there were six  invoices  in  the
         bundle. The appellant believed a business card had  been  submitted
         with his application but accepted that there were  no  photographs,
         literature or evidence that he had paid his NI contributions or tax
         as a self-employed person.


      d. The appellant had been told by his accountant to pay his NI at  the
         end of the  year  and  now  he  had  evidence  that  this  and  the
         corporation tax had been paid. He should  not  be  blamed  for  the
         advice of his accountant and the FtTJ should have  given  him  some
         leeway.


      e. There was evidence that his income was over �30,000 and the fact it
         was for the wrong period was not something that  should  have  been
         held against him.


      f. The FtTJ had sufficient evidence to show the appellant was  running
         a successful business and the FtTJ erred.


 6. Mrs Pettersen responded  to  the  appellants'  grounds  of  appeal  and
    submitted there was no error in law. She submitted:

      a. Mr Afzal missed the point the FtTJ made in her determination namely
         the appellant had failed to provide  the  specified  documents  and
         failed to demonstrate that he received the  income  he  claimed  to
         have received.


      b. The appellant failed to provide evidence that his accountant was  a
         member of a recognised association and the fact  evidence  was  now
         submitted did not mean the FtTJ had erred.


      c. The appellant had to show he had a successful business by providing
         the specified documents.


      d. Any error on the invoices was minor and was not material.


 7. I reserved my decision on all issues.

    MY FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

 8. Permission to appeal was given in this case because Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Osborne found it was arguable the FtTJ may have erred  in
    her assessment of the appellant's business. Mr Afzal agreed  with  this
    finding whereas Mrs Pettersen submitted  that  the  appeal  had  failed
    because the appellant had failed to provide the documents specified  in
    the Rules.


 9. The FtTJ indicated at paragraph [10]  of  her  determination  that  the
    appellant had to demonstrate that he received at least �30,000  over  a
    specified twelve-month period and he had to demonstrate with  reference
    to documents that he had actually received this money.  Paragraph  [22]
    of Appendix A  of  the  Immigration  Rules  makes  clear  that  if  the
    appellant does not indicate a period of assessment of earnings then his
    earnings will be assessed against the twelve-month  period  immediately
    preceding their application and if  the  specified  documents  are  not
    provided then no points would be awarded.

10. The appellant failed to specify a period and the  respondent  and  FtTJ
    correctly applied the Rules. Mr Afzal submitted  the  appellant  should
    have been given some leeway but the Rules are the  same  for  everyone.
    The fact the appellant did not understand the  Rules  is  something  he
    should have considered when making his application.  There  can  be  no
    differential between represented and unrepresented appellants otherwise
    the Rules would be unfair. The FtTJ was entitled to uphold the decision
    to issue no points.

11. The appellant also failed to provide the documents required in  Section
    19 and Section 19-SD of Appendix A. Paragraph 19(b) of Appendix A makes
    it clear that "where a person  is  claiming  points  for  self-employed
    earnings he must provide the specified documents in paragraph 19-SD  to
    show that:

         (i) he is registered as self-employed
         (ii) he was registered as self-employed  during  the  period(s)  of
         self-employment used to claim points, and
         (iii) he was paying Class 2 National Insurance contributions during
         the period(s) of self-employment used to claim points."


12. The appellant acknowledged at the hearing before me he had not provided
    evidence  to  the  FtTJ  that  he  had  been  paying  his  Class  2  NI
    contributions although his explanation to me through Mr Afzal was  that
    his accountant had told him not to make  monthly  payments.  In  normal
    circumstances this may not have presented a problem but because it is a
    mandatory  problem  it  becomes  a  non-compliance  with  a   mandatory
    requirement.


13. Ignorance of the Rules does not assist the appellant. The fact  he  may
    have a viable business is not the test. Meeting the  Immigration  Rules
    and providing the specified  documents  proves  the  viability  of  the
    business.

14. Mr Afzal argued the FtTJ erred when she stated there were only a couple
    of invoices whereas there were in fact six. However, these six invoices
    only covered a two-day period and the finding by  the  FtTJ  remains  a
    valid finding as these hardly supported his claims about the business.

15. Mr Afzal accepted specified documents were not submitted and there  was
    no specified evidence demonstrating he received the monies he claimed.

16. The appellant also failed to  provide  evidence  his  accountants  were
    regulated as required by paragraph  19(g)  of  Appendix  A.  The  Rules
    requires the appellant to provide evidence that his accountant must  be
    either "a fully qualified chartered accountant or certified  accountant
    who is a member of a registered body". The two letters submitted to the
    appellant did not do this and the FTTJ was entitled to make the finding
    she did regardless of the fact the appellant later submitted a  further
    document with his permission to appeal that purports to comply with the
    Rule. It is arguable that even that document does not comply  with  the
    mandatory requirement because the letterhead makes no reference to  the
    named person in the most recent letter and all letters  are  signed  in
    the name of the firm only.

17. The FtTJ found the appellant did not satisfy the  Rules  and  Mr  Afzal
    accepted that  required  documents  had  not  been  submitted.  Various
    reasons were provided but ultimately these were  excuses  and  did  not
    address the fact the Rules were not met.

18. This appeal was refused for not meeting the Rules. Nothing I have heard
    today suggests the Rules were met and consequently  the  appeals  under
    the Immigration Rules are dismissed.

19. There was no appeal under human rights and  that  decision  shall  also
    stand.

    DECISION


20. There was no material error of law  and  the  original  decision  shall
    stand both in respect of the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

21. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
