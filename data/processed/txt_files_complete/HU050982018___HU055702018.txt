Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S. Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Miss M. Malhotra, Counsel instructed by Sri

     Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Miles promulgated after a hearing on 25 September  2018.



 2. I shall refer to Mr Soni as "the appellant" as he was in the First-tier
    Tribunal.  The appellant is a citizen of India born on 8 July 1984.

 3. It was said by the Secretary of State that in an earlier application he
    had misstated his earnings to a significant extent and the Secretary of
    State relied upon that as grounds for refusing a subsequent application
    for further leave to remain.

 4. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, the appellant  was
    represented by Miss Malhotra of Counsel and she appeared before me this
    morning.

 5. There was an issue as to whether the appellant was  acting  dishonestly
    in the returns that he made to HMRC.  In support of his case the  judge
    heard the evidence from  the  appellant's  accountant,  Mr  Patel,  and
    looked at accounts which had been submitted, both  to  Companies  House
    and HMRC on time.  The information from Companies House  was  that  the
    appellant had recorded a dividend of �17,300 referred to by Mr Patel in
    his statement.  Mr Malhotra tells me, and I accept, that this document,
    the return from Companies House, was before the Tribunal in  electronic
    form which was provided to the judge  to  see.   What  the  judge  then
    records in paragraph 16 is this:-

         "In the light of the evidence from the appellant's  accountant,  Mr
         Bhavin Patel, supported by the confirmation  from  the  records  of
         Companies House that the total dividend of �17300 also referred  to
         by Mr Patel in his statement, had been declared to Companies House,
         together with the fact that in this case the burden of establishing
         the appellant's unacceptable conduct lies on the respondent on  the
         balance of probabilities.  I indicated to Mr Entecott  that  I  was
         unable to see how I could reach such a conclusion  although  I  was
         prepared to give him an opportunity to make further submissions  to
         try and dissuade me from that course.  Mr Entecott did not wish  to
         address me further".

 6. It is quite clear that the information to Companies House  is  entirely
    different from the information which was provided by the  appellant  to
    HMRC.  In particular, the documentation provided to  HMRC  is  for  the
    express purpose of calculating the income tax  which  is  payable.   In
    contrast  the  records  to  Companies  House  have  no  direct   fiscal
    consequence.  Consequently, whatever is said to Companies House has  no
    direct bearing on whether  the  appellant  was  acting  dishonestly  in
    relation to his return that he made to HMRC and that was  the  material
    issue.  Consequently, although the evidence of Companies  House  was  a
    part of the picture, it was by no means the  whole  picture.   However,
    this point when it was available for Mr Entecott to make to  the  judge
    in response to his comments was a response that he  expressly  did  not
    make.  Indeed, Miss Malhotra tells me that the judge's record  of  what
    occurred in paragraph 16 of the determination is an accurate one.   The
    only conclusion I can properly draw from this is that Mr  Entecott  was
    conceding the point that the judge could not reasonably conclude  other
    than that the appellant was acting honestly.  In consequence, the judge
    went on in reliance upon what Mr Entecott had  apparently  conceded  to
    find for the appellant.

 7. In these circumstances, there was no material error on the part of  the
    judge.  It was open  to  Mr  Entecott  to  explain  that  there  was  a
    requirement for a freestanding consideration of the tax returns to HMRC
    and it was that the judge was to comment upon, but he did not do  that.
    The judge therefore was under no obligation  to  do  so  himself.   For
    these reasons I dismiss the appeal of the Secretary of State.

DECISION

      i) The appeal of the Secretary of State against the  decision  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge is dismissed.

     ii) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal Judge shall stand.
