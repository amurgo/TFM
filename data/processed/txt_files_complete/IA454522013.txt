Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Mahmood of Sunrise Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufon, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, Muhammad Fazli Rabbi, appeals  with  permission  against
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 23rd April  2014
    dismissing his appeal against the  Respondent's  refusal  to  vary  his
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

 2. On 27th September 2013, the Appellant applied for leave to remain as  a
    Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the   Points   Based   System.
    Essentially one point is in issue. He stated in  his  visa  application
    form that he had �205,574 available for investment and  that  that  sum
    was held by the Allied Bank in Pakistan. The money available  was  held
    in the account of the Appellant's brother Mr Fazal Mahmood  (the  third
    party). The documents submitted in support of  the  appeal  included  a
    letter dated 24th  September  2013  from  the  branch  manager  of  the
    Gulbahar Colony Peshawar, a branch  of  the  Allied  Bank  in  Pakistan
    confirming that

     a) PRs.35,323,442.93 was held by it (the Allied Bank) in  the  account
        of Fazal Mahmood.

     b) Mr Fazal Mahmood was the brother of the Appellant, and

     c)  Mr  Fazal  Mahmood  had  stated  that  he  intended  to  make  the
        Rs.35,323,442.93 available to the Appellant for investment  in  the
        United Kingdom , and

     d) That sum could be transferred to the United Kingdom for  investment
        by the Appellant.

    The documents submitted also included a statement from Mr Fazal Mahmood
    dated 24th September 2013 confirming the foregoing. In  their  covering
    letter, Sunrise Solicitors (acting on the Appellant's behalf) indicated
    that the Appellant intended to carry  on  business  as  a  "fresh  food
    market" in the West Hull area.

 3. On 12th October 2013, the Secretary of State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. She was not satisfied that the requirements  of  paragraph
    245DD of the Immigration Rules, were fulfilled. Specifically,  she  was
    not satisfied  that  the  Appellant  qualified  for  any  points  under
    Appendix A. The matters which concerned her were as follows.

     a) Although the Appellant had provided the  letters  from  the  Allied
        Bank and Mr Mahmood to which I have referred to above, they did not
        state as required by paragraph 41-SD(d)(i)(iv) of Appendix A to the
        Immigration  Rules,  the  amount  of  money  available  in   Pounds
        Sterling, and

     b) The Appellant had  not  provided,  as  required  by  paragraph  41-
        SD9e)(iii)(1) and (iv), any advertising or  marketing  material  or
        any contracts or other documents showing that he was trading.

 4. In coming to his  decision  the  Judge  set  out  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41-SD(d)(i)(iv) which specifically  provides  that  where  an
    applicant relies on money from a third party (as this  applicant  did),
    the declaration from the third party must contain "the amount of  money
    available to the applicant from the third party in Pounds Stirling" (my
    emphasis).

 5. The Judge made a finding  that  the  Appellant  was  relying  on  money
    provided by a third party which did not specify the amount of money  in
    Pounds Stirling, but did  so  in  Pakistani  Rupees.  The  Judge  found
    therefore that the declaration was not a document which  fulfilled  the
    requirements of 41-SD and the upshot was that  the  Appellant  did  not
    qualify for the points required to fulfil the score for the attributes.



 6. So far as the second part of the Respondent's refusal is concerned, the
    Judge made no finding on that, on the basis that it has always been the
    Appellant's claim that since his application is that he has  access  to
    funds of  not  less  than  �200,000,  he  is  not  applying  under  the
    provisions of Table 4(d) and therefore there is no  requirement  placed
    upon him to provide advertising or marketing material specified in  41-
    SD(d)(iii).

 7. Having found against the Appellant under paragraph  41-SD(d)(i)(iv)  of
    Appendix  A  to  the  Immigration  Rules,  the  Judge   dismissed   the
    Appellant's appeal.

 8. The Appellant sought and was granted permission to appeal. The grant of
    permission succinctly sets out what was  before  me  and  the  relevant
    parts are reproduced here.

         "The lengthy grounds seeking permission assert that the Judge erred
         in law in his application of Paragraph  245AA  of  the  Immigration
         Rules. In essence,  the  Appellant  had  submitted  a  document  to
         demonstrate that he had access to third party funds. That  document
         did not state the sum involved in pounds sterling. In  his  equally
         lengthy determination, the Judge concluded that the  deficiency  in
         the document was such that it was not a specified document, and  so
         there was no obligation on the Respondent to contact the  Appellant
         or his legal representative to address the  error  under  Paragraph
         245AA,  because  that  paragraph  refers  to  the  obligations  and
         discretion afforded  to  the  Respondent  upon  the  submission  of
         specified documents.

         It is arguable that the Judge has erred in his conclusion that  the
         absence of information from the documents in question was such that
         it  was  not  a  specified  document.  If  that  were   a   correct
         interpretation,  Paragraph  245AA   would   be   rendered   otiose.
         Accordingly, permission to appeal is granted".

    Thus the matter comes before me to determine whether  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error of law such that the  matter
    needs to be set aside.

The Hearing Before Me

 9. Before me Mr Mahmood submitted that the Judge  had  made  two  material
    errors.

      i) Paragraph 245AA(b) was incorrectly applied, and

     ii) Following on from that the Judge had failed to make a finding  that
         the Respondent should, at the very least, have  considered  whether
         or not to exercise the discretion available to her under  paragraph
         245AA. The failure to consider whether  or  not  to  exercise  that
         discretion amounted to an error of  law  and  therefore  the  Judge
         should have  found  that  the  Respondent's  decision  was  not  in
         accordance with the law and remitted the matter to  the  Respondent
         for consideration of the  exercise of her discretion.

10.  Mr  Tufon  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent  sought   to   defend   the
    determination. He sought to rely on  the  Tribunal  decision  in  Kiran
    Fyyaz [2014] UKUT 00296 (IAC). He submitted  that  following  paragraph
    [29] of that judgment the Appellant's application ought to fail but did
    concede that if I were to find against him then the  matter  should  be
    remitted to the SSHD to decide whether to exercise her discretion.

Has the Judge Erred?

11. I am satisfied that the determination of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    which I am bound to say is a very carefully constructed one,  discloses
    an error of law which  is  material.  I  say  this  for  the  following
    reasons. The Judge carefully sets out at length in [19] and [20] of his
    determination the requirement of paragraph  245AA.  He  sets  that  out
    under the heading,

         "245AA.  Documents not submitted with applications

          a) Where part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part  6A  state
             that specified documents must be provided, the Entry Clearance
             Officer, Immigration Officer or Secretary of State  will  only
             consider  documents  that  have  been  submitted   after   the
             application  where  they  are  submitted  in  accordance  with
             subparagraph (b).

          b) If the applicant has submitted:

              i) A sequence of documents and some of the  documents  in  the
                 sequence have  been  omitted  (for  example,  if  one  bank
                 statement from a series is missing);

             ii) A document in the wrong format; or

            iii) A document that is a copy and not an original document, or

             iv)  A  document  does  not  contain  all  of   the   specified
                 information,

             the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Immigration  Officer  or   the
             Secretary  of  State  may  contact   the   applicant   or   his
             representative in writing, and request the  correct  documents.
             The  requested  documents  must  be  received  at  the  address
             specified in the request within 7 working days of the  date  of
             the request.

          c) Documents will not be requested where a specified document has
             not  been  submitted  (for   example   an   English   language
             certificate is missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer,
             Immigration  Officer  or  the  Secretary  of  State  does  not
             anticipate that addressing the omission or error  referred  to
             in  subparagraph  (b)  will  lead  to  a  grant  because   the
             application will be refused for other reasons.

          d) If the applicant has submitted a specified document:

              i) in the wrong format, or

             ii) that is a copy and not an original document, or

            iii) which does not contain all if  the  specified  information,
                 but the missing information is variable from

                 (1)   other documents submitted with the application,

                 (2)   the website of  the  organisation  which  issued  the
                 document, or

                 (3)   the website of the appropriate regulatory body;

              the application may be granted  exceptionally,  providing  the
             Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or  the  Secretary
             of State is satisfied that the specified documents are  genuine
             and the applicant meets all the other requirements.  The  Entry
             Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or  Secretary  of  State
             reserves the right to request the specified original  documents
             in the correct format in all cases where (b)  applies,  and  to
             refuse applications if these documents are not provided as  set
             out in (b)."

12. For reasons set out in [20] the Judge said,

         "Mr R's failure to submit a declaration which specified the  amount
         of money available in pounds sterling was not the omission of 1  or
         more documents in a sequence. Nor was it a document "in  the  wrong
         format" or a copy rather than an original. Not can it  properly  be
         categorised as a  document  which  did  not  "contain  all  of  the
         specified information." It simply gave the amount of money  in  the
         wrong currency. The case did not therefore  fall  within  paragraph
         245AA(b). There was therefore no obligation  on  the  Secretary  of
         State to make contact with either Mr R or his solicitors to request
         a  document  giving  the  amount  in  sterling.  I  have  in  mind,
         additionally, that paragraph 245AA(b) does impose an obligation  on
         the Secretary of State (or other decision maker) to make contact in
         any of the cases specified. It merely confers a  discretion  to  do
         so. But irrespective of that, the case  was  not,  for  the  reason
         which I have given above, one in which there was that discretion."

13. I disagree with that assessment. In my judgment what the error amounted
    to was a relatively minor one in terms of  presentation.  In  substance
    the sum of Pakistani Rupees 35,223,442.93  equates  with  �205,574.  It
    seems to me that this is precisely the sort of error or omission  which
    the Respondent must have had in mind when she quite  properly  reserved
    to herself under the  Immigration  Rules,  a  discretion  contained  in
    paragraph 245AA(b)(iv), which allows her to contact an applicant or his
    representative in writing, and request the correct documents.

14. In the appeal before me the Respondent has not exercised the discretion
    contained in 245AA(b)(iv) because she has not even  considered  whether
    or not to exercise her discretion. In my judgment that means  that  the
    requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  have  not  been  met  by  the
    Respondent and thus the decision to refuse this application is  not  in
    accordance with the law.

15.  Therefore  I  allow  the  Appellant's  appeal  because  I   find   the
    Respondent's decision is not in accordance with  the  law.  The  matter
    will now be remitted to the Respondent to consider this application  in
    accordance with paragraph 245AA(b)(iv) above.

DECISION

    Appeal allowed to the  extent  that  the  matter  is  remitted  to  the
    Secretary of State for consideration of  her  discretion  in  paragraph
    245AA of the Immigration Rules
