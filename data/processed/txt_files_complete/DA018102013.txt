Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    -


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The Respondent is a national of Zambia born in  1982.  On  the  6th
         February 2015 the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Gibb)  allowed  his
         appeal against the Secretary of  State's  decision  to  deport  him
         pursuant to section 32(5) of the Borders Act 2007.   The  Secretary
         of State now has permission[1] to appeal against that decision.

      2.  The  decision  to  deport  the  Respondent  was  prompted  by  his
         conviction, in January 2013, of use of a false instrument.  He  had
         claimed approximately �12,500 worth of housing benefit to which  he
         was not entitled. The sentencing judge gave the  Respondent  credit
         for his guilty plea but also took a number of aggravating  features
         into account when passing a sentence of 12 months imprisonment. The
         aggravating features included that the Respondent was, at the  time
         that the fraud was perpetrated, subject to a  community  order  for
         another fraud, that one involving credit cards and stolen vehicles.



      3. It  was  against  this  background  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         considered the appeal against deportation. The  Tribunal  correctly
         directed itself that the Respondent's case fell  to  be  considered
         under paragraph 398(b) of the Immigration Rules, and that he  could
         therefore succeed by showing one or more  of  the  'exceptions'  in
         paragraphs 399 or 399A applied.   The central finding thereafter is
         that the 'exception' at paragraph 399 applies  in  this  case:  the
         deportation would have 'unduly  harsh'  consequences  for  his  two
         British children.   Although they had not lived with him as infants
         and had enjoyed little contact with him then the Tribunal  accepted
         the evidence that the two boys, aged  10  and  12,  now  saw  their
         father regularly and that it was in their best interests that  this
         continue. It expressly rejected the contention  that  the  test  of
         'unduly harsh' should focus exclusively on the children [paragraphs
         38-40]:  the determination weighs  in  the  balance  the  offending
         behaviour  of  the  Respondent  [41-42].   The  determination  also
         considers the position of the Respondent's wife.  Having had regard
         to  her  British  nationality,  her  private  life  including   her
         professional employment and her family connections in this country,
         the determination concludes that it would be unduly harsh to expect
         her  to  relocate,  or  in  the  circumstances  tolerate  permanent
         separation from her husband.

      4. The grounds of appeal are lengthy  and  I  mean  no  disrespect  by
         distilling them, with Mr Melvin's  assistance,   to  the  following
         points:

          i) The Tribunal has made findings unsupported by the evidence and
              "failed to provide adequate reasons" for its finding of  fact
             that  the  Respondent  enjoys   a   genuine   and   subsisting
             relationship with children;

         ii) In the alternative the Tribunal has made findings  unsupported
             by the evidence and "failed to provide adequate  reasons"  for
             its finding of fact that it would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
             children to live without any further contact  with  father  in
             the United Kingdom;

        iii)  The  determination  contains  findings  unsupported  by   the
             evidence in respect of whether  the  Respondent's  wife  could
             find employment in Zambia; there was "no independent evidence"
             that she would suffer in his absence.

         iv) In respect of the whole determination the Tribunal  failed  to
             have sufficient regard to the  public  interest:  see  AD  Lee
             [2011] EWCA Civ  348,   SS  (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  550,
             SSHD v AJ (Angola) [2014] EWCA Civ  1636.   The  Tribunal  has
             started its reasoning from a "neutral"  position  rather  than
             beginning by reminding itself  that  the  scales  are  heavily
             weighted in favour of deportation;

          v) The determination fails to take relevant factors into account,
             namely the fact that the  Respondent  has  other  convictions,
             that the fraud was perpetrated over a long period, and that he
             has a propensity to re-offend and potentially cause harm.

      5. To these matters Mr Melvin sought permission to  add  a  sixth;  he
         submitted that the decision was one  that  no  reasonable  decision
         maker could reach and that the entire determination had to  be  set
         aside for irrationality.

    Error of Law: My Findings

    Ground (i)

      6. The Secretary of State contends that  the  determination  does  not
         address  her  submissions  in  respect  of  the  Respondent's  true
         feelings towards his children: paragraph 1 of  the  grounds  states
         that "there is no evidence at all to suggest in any  way  that  his
         involvement in their lives is genuine".

      7. This ground is, in essence, a disagreement  with  the  findings  of
         fact reached, upon careful analysis, by the Tribunal.  It is  clear
         from the determination that the Secretary of State's submissions in
         this respect  were  well  understood:  the  point  is  recorded  at
         paragraph 27 and again at paragraph 33: "the appellant's  behaviour
         since his release was not genuine and was only in response  to  the
         threat of deportation". It is further apparent  that  the  Tribunal
         weighed in its considerations the  fact  that  the  Respondent  had
         behaved dishonestly, and had indeed given dishonest evidence in the
         course of the appeal: see for  instance  paragraphs  28  &  50.  It
         cannot therefore be said that the Secretary of State's  submissions
         were overlooked. The Tribunal viewed the Respondent's own  evidence
         with circumspection, and for that very reason looked to other, more
         objective, sources of information in order to assess the nature  of
         the relationship with the children: see paragraph  28.  Weight  was
         placed on all of the evidence, including that of  the  Respondent's
         ex-wife, in concluding that there is currently a  genuine  parental
         relationship with his sons. Mr Melvin pointed to  the  evidence  of
         that lady in support of the submission that the determination takes
         a narrow and one-sided view of the  evidence.  She  had  previously
         written a letter to the Home Office in which she  had  stated  that
         the Respondent had been largely absent when they were younger (this
         is extensively set out in the refusal letter).  I do not agree that
         this  evidence  was  ignored.  It  is  expressly  acknowledged   at
         paragraphs 11, 14, 20, 21 and  22  of  the  determination.  In  the
         latter, the witness's oral evidence is  recorded  as  follows:  "in
         essence the appellant's first wife indicated that she stood by  the
         contents of the first letter, which was correct at the time it  was
         written, but that the situation had changed significantly since the
         appellant's release from his custodial sentence".   The  First-tier
         Tribunal was entitled to consider the current position to  be  more
         relevant than the Respondent's behaviour towards his sons when they
         were younger. I am satisfied that the  Tribunal  took  all  of  the
         evidence into account in reaching its decision, including the  fact
         that the boys do not live with him but merely see  him  on  contact
         visits: see for instance 20, 24, 44.

    Ground (ii)

      8. The Secretary of State submits that there was a paucity of evidence
         and reasoning to support the First-tier Tribunal's finding that  it
         would be unduly harsh to expect the  boys  to  live  without  their
         father in the  UK.     Mr  Melvin  relied  on  recent  authorities,
         unavailable to the Tribunal at the date of the appeal, which  offer
         guidance as to the meaning of 'unduly harsh'.  The  first  was  KMO
         (section 117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria [2015]  UKUT  00543  (IAC)  in
         which the Upper Tribunal held that this assessment had to  be  made
         with reference to the criminality in question: in  so  finding  the
         Tribunal takes an explicitly different view from that taken in  MAB
         (paragraph 399; "unduly harsh") USA [2015] UKUT 00435  (IAC)  where
         it was held that the exclusive focus of enquiry was the  impact  on
         the child.   In the instant  case  the  First-tier  Tribunal  gives
         careful consideration to the meaning  of  the  term,  and  although
         neither case is mentioned by name, prefers the  approach  taken  in
         KMO to that in MAB. The Secretary  of  State  can  hardly  complain
         about that, and indeed she does not. It is to the high threshold of
         harm that Mr Melvin submits the Tribunal  should  have  looked.  He
         relies upon MK (section 55 - Tribunal options) Sierra Leone  [2015]
         UKUT 223 (IAC) in which the  Upper  Tribunal  held  that  the  term
         'unduly  harsh'  should  not  be   equated   with   "uncomfortable,
         inconvenient, undesirable or merely difficult". In  BM  and  Others
         (returnees - criminal and non-criminal) DRC CG [2015] 293 (IAC)  it
         was held to denote "something severe, or bleak, the  antithesis  of
         pleasant or  comfortable...the  addition  of  the  adverb  'unduly'
         raises an already  elevated  standard  still  higher".   Mr  Melvin
         submits that whatever test the First-tier Tribunal purports to have
         applied, it is not this one.

      9. As I note above, it cannot be said that in  reaching  its  findings
         the Tribunal looked at the children's lives in isolation  from  the
         offending behaviour. At paragraphs 15-18 the Tribunal sets out  the
         Respondent's criminal convictions, and two matters for which he was
         never  convicted.  At  paragraphs  42  and  50  the   determination
         expressly weighs in the balance all of the  criminal  behaviour  of
         the Respondent, not  just  the  index  offence  which  led  to  the
         deportation order, nor indeed his other convictions.  The  Tribunal
         correctly notes,  at  paragraph  49,  that  the  more  serious  the
         offending, the greater the public interest in deportation will  be.
         On the other side of the scales the Tribunal looks  to  the  actual
         impact on the children, at paragraph 44 assessing the  evidence  of
         the boys' mother, their grandmother and the eldest  child  himself.
         All those witnesses agreed that the boys currently  enjoy  a  close
         relationship with their father. The Respondent's ex-wife, his least
         enthusiastic supporter, told the Tribunal that her eldest  son  was
         "negatively affected by his fear of separation" from his father [my
         emphasis].  Having considered all  of  the  evidence  the  Tribunal
         concludes that it would be contrary to the boys' best  interest  to
         lose regular contact with their father, that  the  impact  on  them
         would be "profoundly negative" [51].  Having read the determination
         as a whole I am satisfied that the correct test  was  applied.  The
         Tribunal did not allow this appeal because the alternative  outcome
         would be uncomfortable or undesirable  for  these  children.    The
         finding that it would be profoundly  negative  indicates  that  the
         Tribunal understood that the test  requires  a  high  threshold  of
         harm, and this conclusion was balanced against not only  the  index
         offence, but all of the matters relied upon  by  the  Secretary  of
         State  in  respect  of  the  Respondent's  character,  conduct  and
         convictions.

    Ground (iii)

     10. The third ground of appeal  concerns  the  approach  taken  to  the
         Respondent's current wife and her potential relocation  to  Zambia.
         At paragraphs 52 and 58 the determination notes that she  would  be
         compelled to leave behind her  responsible  professional  job,  her
         close family connections, and the benefits accrued to her by virtue
         of her British nationality. The Secretary  of  State  submits  that
         these are the challenges faced by any �migr� and that without  more
         they cannot be found to be  'insurmountable  obstacles'  or  indeed
         'unduly harsh'.  I would agree. That does not,  however,  have  any
         impact on the outcome of the appeal, since the First-tier  Tribunal
         makes very clear that the appeal is allowed on  the  basis  of  the
         impact on the children: see for instance paragraph 52.

    Ground (iv)

     11. There is no merit at all in the ground that the Tribunal gave  only
         "scant consideration" to  the  public  interest  in  deporting  the
         Respondent.    The   determination   addresses   the   Respondent's
         criminality at paragraphs 2, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 29,  41,  42,  46,
         47, 48, 49 and 50. It cannot therefore seriously be suggested  that
         it failed to have due regard to the fact that  the  Respondent  has
         committed a series of criminal offences. There is  no  misdirection
         when the First-tier Tribunal  states,  at  paragraph  41,  that  by
         statute and jurisprudence it is bound to give a "great  weight"  to
         the public interest in favour of deportation: "the  balance  in  an
         Article 8 proportionality assessment  starts  heavily  weighted  in
         favour of deportation". The latter part of paragraph 42  shows  the
         grounds to be entirely disingenuous in stating  [at  paragraph  12]
         that the Tribunal began its assessment from  a  "neutral"  starting
         point:

             "It will therefore be much harder to succeed  on  an  argument
             about separation from  children  in  a  deportation  case,  in
             comparison to one with no offending element, and it appears to
             me that this must be held in mind when approaching the  unduly
             harsh test. In considering the exceptions [in paragraph 399 of
             the Rules] there is still a need to identify  very  compelling
             countervailing  factors,  if  the  balance  is  to  return  to
             neutral, since it is tipped heavily in favour of  deportation,
             and then tip in the appellant's favour".

    Ground (v)

     12. I have already found that there is no merit in the suggestion  that
         the Tribunal failed to have  regard  to  all  of  the  Respondent's
         criminal behaviour: see paragraph 9 above. Mr Melvin relied on  the
         following passage to submit that the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
         recognise this behaviour as serious:

             "51.      From the perspective of the children, however,  they
             will inevitably not have a  balanced  understanding  of  their
             father's character. It appears to me that the potential impact
             upon  them   of   the   appellant's   deportation   would   be
             considerable,  and  would  be  profoundly  negative.  If   the
             appellant's offending had been more serious it might  be  that
             the negative impact on them would have been enough to outweigh
             the public interest in deportation, but in this case,  bearing
             in mind the nature of the offending, it appears to me that the
             impact on the children would mean  that  it  would  be  unduly
             harsh for them to be separated from  their  father"  [emphasis
             added]

         I am not persuaded that this paragraph contains  any  misdirection.
         The First-tier Tribunal was  simply  pointing  out  that  the  more
         serious the offending, the  more  unlikely  it  will  be  that  the
         balance will swing in favour of the foreign criminal.  The  use  of
         the adverb "more" indicates that the  Tribunal  already  recognised
         the seriousness of the offending.

    Ground (vi)

     13. This is not the decision that every Tribunal  would  have  reached.
         That is not however the Wednesbury test of irrationality. This  was
         a detailed and balanced determination in which the public  interest
         was given its full weight and the Secretary of State's  submissions
         were fully considered.  It has not been shown to be perverse.

    Decisions

     14. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no  error  of
         law and it is upheld.

     15. The First-tier Tribunal made a direction for anonymity.  Before  me
         no party made any application to alter that. The Respondent himself
         is a criminal who has already been publicly tried and convicted  in
         the criminal courts and should therefore not have the benefit of  a
         grant of anonymity. This case has however turned on the presence in
         the United Kingdom of his two British sons, who are both minors.  I
         agree  with  the  assessment  of  the  First-tier   Tribunal   that
         identifying the Respondent could in turn lead to the identification
         of the boys. For that reason, having had regard to Rule 14  of  the
         Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential
         Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders, I make the  following
         direction:

             "Unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the
             Respondent  is  granted  anonymity.   No   report   of   these
             proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any
             member of his family.  This  direction  applies  both  to  the
             Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply with  this
             direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings".
