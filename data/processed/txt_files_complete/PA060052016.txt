                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Martin, of Jain, Neil & Ruddy, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Kurdish citizen of Iraq, from Erbil,  born  on  [  ]
    1995.

 2. The appellant says that his family is devoutly Muslim.  His father is a
    senior member of the KDP and his brother  works  for  the  party  as  a
    policeman.  They were enraged by  the  appellant's  loss  of  faith  in
    Islam, which led to a series of incidents, in the  last  of  which  the
    appellant's brother tried to shoot him, so he fled from Iraq to the UK.

 3. The respondent refused the appellant's  protection  claim  by  decision
    dated 2 June 2016.  His account of abandoning Islam, his father's power
    within the KDP, and of abuse by and risk from his family, was found not
    credible (pp.6-9).  Alternatively, he could  relocate  (pp.9-11,  under
    refence to AA Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 00544).  The claim was  refused  also
    by reference to sufficiency  of  protection,  humanitarian  protection,
    articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR, and private and family life, and  absence
    of exceptional circumstances.

 4. FtT Judge Paul dismissed the appellant's appeal by decision promulgated
    on 13 December 2016.

 5. The appellant applied to the FtT for permission to appeal to the UT, on
    2 grounds.

 6.  Ground 1 avers  inadequacy  of  reasoning;  contradictions  among  the
    findings at �24, evidence given in a clear manner and at  �26,  account
    not reliable but  grain  of  truth  in  difficulties  with  family;  no
    explanation why unbelievable that lapse in faith might result in family
    seeking to execute him;  this  failed  to  engage  with  evidence  from
    appellant that his father was an imam; "in these  circumstances  it  is
    entirely feasible the problems faced by the appellant would have flowed
    from his actions"; the judge's findings cannot be sustained.

 7. Ground 2 says that the judge failed to follow  AA;  his  task  was  not
    limited to whether return to Baghdad involved a risk under  article  3;
    AA indicated that the appellant would be returned to Erbil;  the  judge
    was satisfied the appellant gave an entirely false account  of  how  he
    came to the UK; the conclusion that he had ties with family  and  would
    be able to contact them was "entirely  irrational  as  the  appellant's
    family reside in an entirely different jurisdiction".

 8. On 4 January 2017 FtT Judge Nightingale refused permission, on the view
    that the  judge  gave  sustainable  reasons  and  reached  no  arguably
    conflicting conclusions; and that as the appellant established no  risk
    if returned to the IKR, of which he was a  resident,  consideration  of
    return via Baghdad was irrelevant.

 9. The appellant renewed  his  application  to  the  UT,  maintaining  his
    grounds and  submitting  that  Judge  Nightingale  had  compounded  the
    errors.

10. On 23 February  2017  UT  Judge  Allen  granted  permission,  with  the
    observation, "Whether there is any  materiality  to  the  challenge  in
    light of the possibility of internal relocation is a matter  which  may
    need to be raised at the next hearing".

11. Mr Martin made submissions along the lines of the grounds.  He accepted
    that ground 1 was crucial, and that if the appellant failed to displace
    the credibility findings, his case was defeated by the fact that he  is
    from the IKR, which is virtually free of violence.

12. Mr  Matthews  submitted  that  ground  1  showed  no  inconsistency  of
    findings, and no failure to put the account in context.  The judge  set
    out the claim that the appellant's father was an imam and his brother a
    policeman.  There was nothing to suggest that he forgot about that when
    reaching his findings.  Those findings were  open  to  the  judge,  and
    rationally explained.  Ground 2 might disclose  incidental  error,  but
    nothing which might produce a different outcome.

13. I reserved my decision.

14. The judge took the view that the appellant gave his  evidence  clearly,
    and that there might be some grain of truth regarding family  conflict.
    That does not conflict with or dictate a  finding  that  everything  he
    said had to be accepted.  Almost every  adverse  finding  involves  the
    drawing of a line between what is proved to the necessary standard  and
    what is not.

15. The judge took evident care over the correct approach (�23-26)  and  in
    drawing that line (�26-29).  He was entitled to find it too extreme for
    belief that the appellant's family would seek to deal  with  a  wayward
    teenager by executing him.  He further noted that an attempt at  public
    execution by his brother was  hard  to  reconcile  with  the  appellant
    thereupon being in possession of a  passport  and  funds  and  able  to
    purchase a ticket to leave Iraq.

16. Ground 1 discloses no more than insistence and disagreement.   It  does
    not show  that  the  decision  is  self-contradictory  or  inadequately
    reasoned.

17. Even if ground 1 had succeeded,  the  case  was  one  which  failed  on
    internal relocation.

18. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

19. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
