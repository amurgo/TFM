                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal B A Morris promulgated on 29th April 2014.

 2. The Appellant is a female Albanian  citizen  born  3rd  July  1987  who
    applied for entry clearance to enable  her  to  settle  in  the  United
    Kingdom with her husband LP (the Sponsor).

 3. The application was  refused  on  10th  June  2013.   In  refusing  the
    application the Respondent relied  upon  paragraph  320(11)  contending
    that the Appellant had previously contrived in  a  significant  way  to
    frustrate the intention of the Immigration Rules, and that  aggravating
    circumstances  applied.   In  giving  reasons  for  this  decision  the
    Respondent  pointed  out  that  the  Sponsor   had   obtained   British
    nationality by deception,  by  claiming  to  be  Kosovan,  and  it  had
    subsequently been discovered that he was in fact Albanian.   When  this
    was discovered the  Secretary  of  State  considered  whether  to  take
    proceedings to deprive the Sponsor of his nationality.   The  Appellant
    had applied for settlement in August 2007,  and  rather  than  await  a
    decision  as  to  whether  the  Sponsor  would  be  deprived   of   his
    nationality, the Appellant entered  the  United  Kingdom  illegally  in
    2008.  She was discovered working illegally on 5th September 2008.  She
    admitted entering the United Kingdom illegally using a false  document,
    and purchasing a counterfeit visa in order  to  take  employment.   The
    Appellant had also obtained NHS services to which she was not entitled.
     She was removed from the United Kingdom  on  11th  September  2008  at
    public expense.

 4. In addition the application was  refused  as  the  Respondent  did  not
    accept that the financial requirements of Appendix FM  were  satisfied.
    This  was  because  the  Sponsor's  income  was  calculated  as   being
    �13,840.84, which was below the required minimum of �18,600 per  annum.



 5. The appeal was heard by Judge Morris (the judge)  on  4th  April  2014.
    After hearing evidence from  the  Sponsor  the  judge  found  that  the
    Respondent  had  correctly  applied  paragraph  320(11)  and  that  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM were not  satisfied.   The  judge
    concluded that the Appellant could not satisfy either Appendix  FM,  or
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules, in relation  to  family  and
    private life, and did not consider it necessary to consider  Article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules.  The appeal was therefore dismissed.

 6. The Appellant was granted permission to  appeal  and  the  appeal  came
    before me on 31st July 2014.  I found that the judge had not  erred  in
    finding that paragraph 320(11) had been applied.  I also found that the
    judge had not misdirected herself in relation to the burden  of  proof,
    as had  been  contended  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant,  nor  had  she
    misapplied the principles set out  in  Devaseelan  when  considering  a
    previous appeal.

 7. I  found  that  the  judge  had  erred  in  considering  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM, and  had  erred  in  failing  to  consider
    Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights  outside  the
    rules, and had failed to consider the best interests of a child.

 8.  Full  details  of  the  application  for  permission,  the  grant   of
    permission, and my reasons for finding an error of law are contained in
    my decision dated 4th August 2013, which was promulgated on 8th  August
    2014.

 9. The hearing was adjourned as I decided that I needed  to  hear  further
    submissions from both representatives in relation to Article 8,  and  I
    also wished to hear from both parties as to whether the Upper  Tribunal
    decision MA and SM (Zambrano - EU children outside EU) Iran [2013] UKUT
    00380 (IAC) had any relevance to the appeal.

Re-Making the Decision

Submissions

10. Mr Fripp indicated that he did not intend to call further evidence  but
    relied upon the evidence that had been  placed  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and a further bundle of  documents  comprising  twenty  pages,
    submitted on behalf of the Appellant.  Mr Melvin did not object to this
    bundle being admitted in evidence.

11. Mr Melvin relied upon his written submissions dated  3rd  October  2014
    and submitted that the child's British nationality should not  be  used
    as a trump card to enable the Appellant to enter  the  United  Kingdom.
    Mr Melvin also relied upon the decision to refuse entry clearance dated
    10th June 2013.

12. Mr Melvin accepted that the best interests  of  the  child  had  to  be
    considered, but submitted that the appeal under Article 8 of  the  1950
    Convention should be dismissed.

13. Mr Fripp relied upon his skeleton argument dated 3rd October 2014.   In
    brief summary I was asked to take into  account  that  the  Appellant's
    breach of the immigration law occurred just over six years ago.  I  was
    asked to note that the Secretary of State had decided not to  instigate
    proceedings  to  deprive  the  Sponsor  of  his  British   nationality.
    Therefore the Sponsor is a British citizen, as is the daughter  of  the
    Sponsor and Appellant who was born in Albania on 13th April 2011.

14. I was asked to take into account that the evidence indicated  that  the
    Sponsor's income was in excess of �18,600 per annum, and  therefore  he
    could adequately maintain his family.  The best interests of the  child
    would be served by being with both her parents in the  United  Kingdom.
    Mr Fripp relied upon MA and SM  and  submitted  that  to  refuse  entry
    clearance to the Appellant would be a  breach  of  Article  20  of  the
    Treaty on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union.   Therefore  the
    Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the law.

15. If I rejected that submission,  Mr  Fripp  submitted  that  the  appeal
    should be allowed under Article 8 on the basis  that  the  Respondent's
    decision is disproportionate, taking into account the  length  of  time
    since the Appellant was removed from the United  Kingdom  in  September
    2008, and that the best interests of her British citizen child would be
    served by living in the United Kingdom with both parents.

16. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

Findings of Fact

17. The Sponsor was born in Kosovo.  He arrived in the  United  Kingdom  in
    1998 and made a false claim for asylum.  The Sponsor  was  subsequently
    granted indefinite leave to remain and thereafter his  application  for
    British citizenship was granted.

18. The Sponsor and Appellant married  in  Albania  in  August  2007.   The
    Appellant  applied  for  entry  clearance  and  the   Sponsor's   birth
    certificate was submitted with this application which  showed  that  he
    had been born in Albania.  Therefore  consideration  was  given  as  to
    whether he should be deprived of his British nationality.  This  caused
    a delay in making the decision upon the Sponsor's application for entry
    clearance.

19. Rather than wait for the result  of  the  enquiries  to  be  made,  the
    Sponsor and Appellant decided  that  the  Appellant  should  enter  the
    United Kingdom illegally, which she did,  and  having  purchased  false
    documentation commenced  working  illegally.   She  also  received  NHS
    treatment to which she was not entitled.

20. The Appellant was discovered working illegally on 5th  September  2008,
    and shortly after this was removed at public expense.

21. In March 2009 a decision was  made  not  to  instigate  proceedings  to
    deprive the Sponsor of his British nationality, on the  basis  that  he
    had arrived in the United Kingdom as a minor.

22. The entry clearance application made by the Appellant  in  August  2007
    was  refused,  and  her  subsequent  appeal  dismissed  by  way  of   a
    determination promulgated on 4th January 2010.

23. In March 2010 the  Appellant  made  a  further  application  for  entry
    clearance as a spouse, which was refused in April 2010, and her  appeal
    dismissed by way of a determination promulgated on 10th December  2010.



24. On 16th April 2013 the Appellant made a further application  for  entry
    clearance, the refusal of which is the subject of this appeal.

25. It is a fact that the Sponsor is a British citizen, as is his daughter.
     The Sponsor has employment, and the evidence  submitted,  including  a
    letter from his employer, bank statements, and payslips, proves that he
    earns in excess of �18,600 per annum.  There has been no  challenge  to
    the fact that the Sponsor and Appellant have  a  genuine  relationship,
    and that the Sponsor makes trips to Albania to visit the Appellant  and
    their daughter, and his absence from his employment, has held back  his
    opportunities for promotion.





My Conclusions and Reasons

26. The general rule in considering Immigration Rules is that the burden of
    proof is on the Appellant, and the  standard  of  proof  a  balance  of
    probability.   The burden in relation to paragraph 320(11)  is  on  the
    respondent.

27.  As  this  is  an  entry  clearance  appeal  I  have   considered   the
    circumstances appertaining at the date of refusal, that being 10th June
    2013.  I am satisfied that  this  applies  to  consideration  of  human
    rights in an entry clearance appeal, as was confirmed in AS (Somalia) v
    SSHD [2009] UKHL 32.

28. I have taken into account all the evidence that was before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, together with the further evidence provided to the Upper
    Tribunal.  If a piece of evidence is not specifically referred to, this
    does not mean that it has not been considered, as  it  is  impractical,
    and unnecessary to rehearse every individual piece of evidence.

29. This appeal cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules because  of  the
    application of paragraph 320(11).

30. I am asked to consider Article 8 outside the rules.  Mr Melvin did  not
    submit that this  would  not  be  appropriate.   The  Court  of  Appeal
    considered this issue in MM [2014] EWCA Civ 985 and  I  set  out  below
    paragraph 135 of that decision;

         135. Where the relevant group  of  IRs  (Immigration  Rules),  upon
             their proper  construction,  provide  a  "complete  code"  for
             dealing with a person's Convention Rights in the context of  a
             particular IR or statutory provision, such as in the  case  of
             "foreign criminals", then the balancing exercise and  the  way
             the various factors  are  to  be  taken  into  account  in  an
             individual case must be done in  accordance  with  that  code,
             although references to "exceptional circumstances" in the code
             will nonetheless entail a proportionality  exercise.   But  if
             the relevant group of IRs is not such a "complete  code"  then
             the proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided
             by the Huang tests and UK and Strasbourg case law.

31. The Appellant and Sponsor have a British child, living in Albania  with
    the Appellant.  Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration
    Act 2009 does not apply because the child is not in the United Kingdom,
    and that section relates to the  need  to  safeguard  and  promote  the
    welfare of children who are in the United Kingdom.  However  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Mundeba [2013] UKUT 88 (IAC) decided that the  exercise  of
    the duty by an Entry Clearance Officer to assess an  application  under
    the  Immigration  Rules  as  to  whether  there  are  family  or  other
    considerations making  the  child's  exclusion  undesirable  inevitably
    involves an assessment of what the child's welfare and  best  interests
    require.  Where an Immigration Decision engages Article 8  rights,  due
    regard must be had to the UN Convention on the  Rights  of  the  Child.
    Therefore  the  best  interests  of  the  child  should  be  a  primary
    consideration.

32. The best interests of the child were not considered by  the  Respondent
    in the refusal  decision,  and  have  not  been  considered  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  It is therefore my view that it is  appropriate  to
    consider Article 8 outside the rules.

33. Article 8 was  considered,  albeit  briefly  in  paragraph  16  of  the
    determination promulgated on 10th December 2010, and therefore  I  have
    considered  the  Devaseelan  principles.   Paragraphs  37  to   39   of
    Devaseelan [2003] Imm AR 1 are relevant.  In brief summary  a  previous
    determination should be a starting point as an authoritative assessment
    of the Appellant's status at the time it was made.  It is  not  binding
    upon a subsequent decision-maker and facts happening since the previous
    determination can always be taken into account.

34. In this case, I take into account that almost  four  years  has  passed
    since  the  previous  determination  was  promulgated,  and  that   the
    Appellant and Sponsor now have a child who is  a  British  citizen.   I
    therefore consider that it is appropriate to reassess Article 8 outside
    the Immigration Rules.

35. I set out below Article 8 of the 1950 Convention;


         1.   Everyone has the right to respect for his private  and  family
             life, his home and his correspondence.
         2.   There shall be no interference by a public authority with  the
             exercise of this right except such as is  in  accordance  with
             the law and is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
             interests of national security, public safety or the  economic
             well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder  or
             crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or  for  the
             protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

36. In considering Article 8 I adopt the step-by-step approach advocated in
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 which involves answering the following questions;


         (i)  Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
             authority with  the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
             respect for his private or (as the case may be) family life?
         (ii) If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?
         (iii)    If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
         (iv) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
             economic well-being of the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?
         (v)  If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             public end sought to be achieved?

37. Although Razgar applied to a removal case, I find that  the  principles
    are relevant to an entry  clearance  case.   I  also  accept  that  the
    decision in Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39 means that I  have  to  consider
    the family life of the family, and not only that of the Appellant.

38. This is a case that is concerned with family life as opposed to private
    life.  I am satisfied that the Appellant, Sponsor and their child  have
    established a family life.  The Appellant and Sponsor are married,  and
    I am satisfied that they have a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship,
    and that they wish to live permanently together as a family unit.  I am
    satisfied  that  the  decision  to  refuse  entry   clearance   is   an
    interference with  that  family  life,  and  engages  Article  8.   The
    threshold of engagement is not especially high.

39. I then have to consider the third question posed in Razgar, whether the
    proposed interference is in accordance with the law.  I  find  that  it
    is.  This is because the Appellant cannot satisfy the Immigration Rules
    that relate to  entry  clearance,  and  I  do  not  accept  Mr  Fripp's
    submission that refusal of entry clearance would be a breach of EU law.



40. I have considered MA and SM and set out below paragraph 44;

         44.  In EU law terms, there  is  no  reason  why  the  decision  in
             Zambrano could not in principle be relied upon by the  parent,
             or other primary carer, of a minor EU national living  outside
             the EU as long as it  is  the  intention  of  the  parent,  or
             primary carer, to accompany the EU national child  to  his/her
             country of nationality, in the instant appeals that being  the
             United Kingdom.  To  conclude  otherwise  would  deny  access,
             without justification, to a whole  class  of  EU  citizens  to
             rights they are entitled to by virtue  of  their  citizenship.
             Mr Deller did not seek to argue to the contrary.

41. As with the Appellants in MA and SM, neither the child, nor the Sponsor
    have, or intend to, move within the territory of the member states, and
    therefore  the  Appellant  can  place  no  reliance  on  EC   Directive
    2004/38/EC.

42. Article 20 of the Treaty on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union
    (TFEU) provides that every national  of  a  Member  State  shall  be  a
    citizen of the EU, and shall have the right to move and  reside  freely
    within the territory of the member states.  I set out below Article  20
    of the TFEU;

         1.   Citizenship of the Union is hereby established.  Every  person
             holding the nationality of a Member State shall be  a  citizen
             of the Union.  Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to
             and not replace national citizenship.

         2.   Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights and be subject to
             the duties provided for in the  Treaties.   They  shall  have,
             inter alia:

             (a)  the right to move and reside freely within the  territory
                  of the Member State;

             (b)  ...

             (c)  ...

             (d)  ...

             These  rights  shall  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the
             conditions and limits defined  by  the  Treaties  and  by  the
             measures adopted thereunder.

43. I set out below paragraph 45 of Ruiz  Zambrano  (European  citizenship)
    [2011] EUECJ C-34/09;

         45.  Accordingly, the answer to  the  questions  referred  is  that
             Article 20 TFEU is  to  be  interpreted  as  meaning  that  it
             precludes  a  Member  State  from  refusing  a  third  country
             national upon whom his minor children, who are European  Union
             citizens, are dependent, a right of residence  in  the  Member
             State of residence and nationality of those children, and from
             refusing  to  grant  a  work  permit  to  that  third  country
             national, in so far as such decisions deprive  those  children
             of the genuine  enjoyment  of  the  substance  of  the  rights
             attaching to the status of European Union citizen.

44. Applying  the  above  principles  to  this  appeal,  I  find  that  the
    circumstances of the Appellant are more  in  line  with  those  of  the
    second Appellant rather than the first  Appellant  in  MA  and  SM.   I
    conclude that refusal to admit the  Appellant  to  the  United  Kingdom
    would not deprive a child of the genuine enjoyment of the substance  of
    the rights associated with her status as an EU citizen.  The Sponsor in
    the United Kingdom would be able to look after the child.  He may  need
    to alter his working hours to arrange for care of the child, but as was
    pointed out in MA and SM in paragraph 56, even if the Sponsor cannot be
    as  economically  active   as   he   would   wish   because   of   care
    responsibilities, this would not be sufficient to support a  conclusion
    that the child would be denied the genuine enjoyment of EU  citizenship
    rights, nor would this be the case even if the Sponsor were required to
    stop working altogether.  The Tribunal in paragraph 56  of  MA  and  SM
    stated;

         The right of residence is a right to reside in the territory of the
         EU.  It is not a right to any particular quality of life or to  any
         particular standard of living (see  Dereci  at  paragraph  68,  and
         Harrison at paragraph 67).

45. I therefore conclude that the refusal of entry clearance would not lead
    to a breach of Article 20 of the TFEU.

46. I then have to consider the fourth and fifth questions posed in Razgar,
    whether the interference with family life is necessary for one  of  the
    reasons set out in  Article  8(2),  and  whether  the  interference  is
    proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be achieved.

47. In making a  proportionality  assessment  under  Article  8,  the  best
    interests of the child must be a primary consideration which means that
    they must be considered first, although they can be outweighed  by  the
    cumulative effect of other considerations.  As held  in  ZH  (Tanzania)
    [2011] UKSC 4, the best interests of a child broadly  means  the  well-
    being of a child, and a consideration  of  those  best  interests  will
    involve asking whether it is reasonable to expect the child to live  in
    another country.  Although nationality is not a "trump card" it  is  of
    particular importance in assessing the best interests of any child.

48. The Upper Tribunal decided in MK India [2011] UKUT 00475 that the  best
    interests of a child must be addressed first as a distinct inquiry, and
    factors relating to the public interest in the maintenance of effective
    immigration control must not form part of the  best  interests  of  the
    child consideration.

49. The Upper Tribunal decided in Azimi-Moayed [2013] UKUT 00197 that as  a
    starting point it is in the best interests of children to be with  both
    their parents.  It is generally in the interests of  children  to  have
    both stability and continuity of social and educational provision,  and
    the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of the society to which
    they belong.

50. In this case, I have no hesitation in finding that the  best  interests
    of the child would be to be brought up by both parents.  I find that it
    would be in the best interests of the child to be  brought  up  in  the
    United Kingdom where the Sponsor can provide adequate financial support
    and accommodation.  I am satisfied that the best interests of the child
    would be served by being in the United Kingdom  rather  than  being  in
    Albania.

51. Having considered the best interests of the child,  I  must  go  on  to
    consider whether there are any countervailing considerations.   I  take
    into account section 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002.  This states that the maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    control is in the public interest.  It is in the public interest that a
    person seeking to enter the United Kingdom is able  to  speak  English,
    and that they are financially independent.   Little  weight  should  be
    given to a relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying  partner  if  that
    relationship is established by a person at a time when the person is in
    the United Kingdom unlawfully.

52. The Appellant can speak English.  Her application under the Immigration
    Rules was not refused on that basis.  I am satisfied that  the  Sponsor
    is in employment, and has an income in excess of �18,600 per year,  and
    he has provided specified documentation to prove that.

53. The relationship between the Appellant and Sponsor and the relationship
    between the Sponsor and his daughter, was formed  while  the  Appellant
    and daughter were in Albania.

54. I take into account the very serious breaches  of  immigration  law  by
    both the Sponsor  and  Appellant.   Those  breaches  carry  significant
    weight.

55. However I do take into account that it is now just over six years since
    the Appellant was removed from the United Kingdom.  The fact  that  the
    child in this appeal is a British citizen is not a "trump card", but it
    is an important point.  I also attach significant weight  to  the  fact
    that if the Appellant was granted entry clearance, there  would  be  no
    further claim on public funds, as the  Sponsor  is  in  a  position  to
    adequately financially maintain his family.

56. If entry clearance is refused, the consequence will be either that  the
    child is unable to live in the United Kingdom, a country of  which  she
    is a citizen, or she will be able to live in the  United  Kingdom  with
    the Sponsor, and she will be permanently separated from her mother, the
    Appellant.

57. The assessment of proportionality involves  a  balancing  exercise.   I
    have set out the factors that favour entry clearance being granted, and
    the factors that go against the  Appellant,  those  factors  being  the
    breach of immigration law committed over six years ago.

58. My conclusion is that the best interests of the  child  in  being  with
    both parents, and being able to live in the country of which she  is  a
    national, and being adequately financially maintained and  accommodated
    without recourse to  public  funds,  outweighs  the  behaviour  of  the
    Appellant and Sponsor in breaching immigration law in 2008.   For  that
    reason I conclude that the  appeal  should  be  allowed  on  Article  8
    grounds.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds in relation to  Article  8  of
the 1950 Convention.

Anonymity

Because this appeal involved the consideration of the best  interests  of  a
minor, I  make  an  anonymity  direction  under  rule  14  of  The  Tribunal
Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  This order is  to  remain  in  place
unless or until this Tribunal,  or  any  other  appropriate  Court,  directs
otherwise.  No report of these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify the Appellant or any member of her family.  Failure to comply  with
this direction could amount to a contempt of court.

FEE AWARD

The appeal has been allowed under Article 8 of the  1950  Convention.   This
is because I  have  considered  evidence  that  was  not  available  to  the
Respondent when the decision was made.  There is therefore no fee award.
