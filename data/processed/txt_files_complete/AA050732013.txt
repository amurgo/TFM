Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Tetty, Counsel


                                  DECISION

      1. Mr Harrison applied for permission to withdraw  the  SSHD's  appeal
         against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies  dated  20
         October 2014, in which he allowed ID's asylum appeal.

      2. I consent to the withdrawal in accordance with rule  17(2)  of  the
         Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (as  amended).   Mr
         Harrison was entirely correct to withdraw the appeal.  Judge Davies
         accepted  the  credibility  of  ID's  account.   This  included  an
         explanation for the inconsistencies set  out  within  the  decision
         letter.  Judge Davies accepted this explanation, which was entirely
         consistent with the relevant background information.

      3. It follows that that as the appeal against Judge  Davies'  decision
         has been withdrawn  by  the  SSHD,  and  it  stands  as  the  final
         unappealed decision.

Judge of the Upper Tribunal
