For the Respondent:    Mr Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. The Appellant in this appeal was the  Respondent  before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal and the Respondent the Appellant. For the sake of ease  I  refer
   to them as the Claimant and Entry Clearance Officer  (ECO)  respectively.
   The Claimant is a national of Somalia born on 1 January 1972. He  applied
   to come to the United Kingdom as the spouse of Mrs Muna Sharif Omar.  The
   ECO refused his application and the Claimant appealed to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal. First-tier Tribunal Judge Rolt allowed his appeal in a decision
   promulgated on 1 September 2015. The ECO sought permission to appeal that
   decision and permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pooler
   in a decision dated 20 January 2016. He found it arguable that the  Judge
   misdirected himself in law and/or failed to  give  adequate  reasons  for
   finding that the requirements of the Rules were met. He  considered  that
   in particular it was not clear that he directed himself by  reference  to
   the specific requirements of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE.  He  granted
   permission on two grounds only.


2. At a hearing on 25 April 2016 and in a decision promulgated thereafter  I
   concluded that there was a material error of law in the decision  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal. The  First-tier  Tribunal  had  concluded  that  the
   Claimant satisfied the financial requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
   without reference to Appendix FM-SE and by reference  to  the  Claimant's
   credibility and the P60s submitted on his behalf. The First-tier Tribunal
   was required to calculate the sponsor's income by reference  to  Appendix
   FM-SE and the failure to do so amounted to an error of  law.  That  error
   was material because it could not be said that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   would have reached the same conclusion in the absence of the  error.   As
   there was an issue between the parties as to  whether  the  Claimant  had
   submitted evidence with the application that met the income threshold  of
   �18,600 and the fact-finding was limited I retained the case in the Upper
   Tribunal and gave directions.



   The Re-hearing

3. At the rehearing  I  heard  submissions  from  both  representatives.  Mr
   McConnell relied on a schedule setting out the  sponsor's  wage  payments
   from Dr G Adam. He said that the specified evidence showed that there was
   gross income of �5363.50 over the specified period which  equated  to  an
   annual gross income of �10,727. Mr Richards conceded  that  the  evidence
   showed that discounting the July salary and projecting it  to  an  annual
   total the Claimant passed the income threshold when that income was taken
   together with the income from  the  sponsor's  employment  in  her  other
   employment which was conceded by the ECO to be �9479.52.

4. In the light of Mr Richard's position and on the basis  of  the  evidence
   before me I conclude that the Claimant has demonstrated by virtue of  the
   specified  evidence  submitted  with  the  application  that  the  income
   threshold has been reached. The application for entry clearance was  made
   on 11 August 2014. The payslips showing the gross and  net  payments  for
   the period February to July 2014 are at pages 19 and 20 of his bundle and
   the entries in the personal bank statements  corresponding  to  the  same
   period show the net amount deposited from pages 29 to 38 of  the  bundle.
   The sponsor's gross annual salary in this  employment  evidenced  by  the
   specified evidence amounts to �10,727 and when added to the  salary  from
   her other employment makes a total gross salary  of  �20,206.52.  In  the
   circumstances the Appellant meets the requirements of  section  E-ECP  of
   Appendix FM. I informed the parties I would allow the appeal,  with  full
   reasons to follow.




   Costs

5. Mr McConnell made an application for costs.  He  said  that  this  appeal
   could have been conceded and today's hearing  could  have  been  avoided.
   Appeals took twelve months to come to court and there  were  good  policy
   reasons for an order of costs  to  be  made.  He  had  written  to  Kevin
   Littleton on 14 September 2016 asking  him  to  concede  the  appeal  and
   highlighting that he would need permission to withdraw the decision under
   Rule 17 (2).

6. Mr Richards resisted the application. He said that Mr Littleton  was  not
   his manager and managed both Cardiff and Birmingham  and  Upper  Tribunal
   cases were not under the Specialist appeals team. The decision in respect
   of the error of law was promulgated on 6 July 2016  and  the  application
   could have been made before. It was not an appropriate case for an  award
   of costs.

7. I gave an oral decision in respect of  the  application  for  costs.  The
   power to make an award of costs is to be found in  Rule  10  (3)  of  the
   Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. The  Upper  Tribunal  may
   not make an order in respect of costs or expenses except under section 29
   (4) of the 2007 Act (wasted costs) and if the  Upper  Tribunal  considers
   that a party or its representative has acted  unreasonably  in  bringing,
   defending, or conducting the proceedings.  Cancino  [2015]  UKFTT  00059,
   although a First-tier Tribunal decision, it was  heard  before  both  the
   President of the Upper Tribunal  and  the  President  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal for the purpose of providing guidance on costs and was reported.
     The wording of Rule 9 in the Tribunal  Rules  2014  and  in  the  Upper
   Tribunal Rules  is  the  same.  The  Tribunal  referred  to  the  leading
   authority on wasted cost orders, which is the decision of  the  Court  of
   Appeal in  Ridehalgh  v  Horsefield  [1994]  Ch  205.   The  decision  in
   Ridehalgh envisages a three stage test: (a) Has the legal  representative
   of whom complaint is made acted improperly, unreasonably or  negligently?
   (b) If so, did such conduct cause  the  applicant  to  incur  unnecessary
   costs? (c) If so, is it in all the circumstances  of  the  case  just  to
   order the legal representative to compensate the applicant for the  whole
   or any part of the relevant costs? There must be a causal  nexus  between
   the conduct complained of and the wasted costs claimed.

8. Acting "improperly" was described by the Court  of  Appeal  as  covering,
   but not confined to, conduct which would ordinarily be  held  to  justify
   disbarment, striking off,  suspension  from  practice  or  other  serious
   professional penalty.   It  would  cover  any  significant  breach  of  a
   substantial duty imposed by a relevant code of professional  conduct  but
   was not limited to that.  Conduct which would  be  regarded  as  improper
   according to the consensus of professional (including  judicial)  opinion
   could be fairly stigmatised as such whether or not it violated the letter
   of a professional  code.  Unreasonableness  describes  conduct  which  is
   vexatious, designed to harass the other  side  rather  than  advance  the
   resolution of the case and it makes no difference that the conduct is the
   product of excessive zeal and not improper  motive.   Conduct  cannot  be
   described as unreasonable simply because it leads  in  the  event  to  an
   unsuccessful result or because other more cautious legal  representatives
   would have acted differently.  The  acid  test  is  whether  the  conduct
   permits a reasonable explanation.  If  so,  the  course  adopted  may  be
   regarded as optimistic and as reflecting on  a  practitioner's  judgment,
   but it is not unreasonable. Negligence was to be  understood  in  a  non-
   technical way to denote failure to act with the competence reasonably  to
   be expected of ordinary members of the profession.  The power to  make  a
   wasted costs order is discretionary.

9.  It is clear from my decision in respect of the  error  of  law  in  this
   case that there was an issue between the parties to be  determined  at  a
   further hearing. I therefore conclude that notwithstanding the fact  that
   I allowed the appeal on the evidence before the ECO the  matter  was  not
   sufficiently clear-cut to bring the conduct of ECO  within  the  type  of
   conduct foreseen above as  required  to  lead  to  an  order  for  costs.
   Further, the Claimant's representatives only invited the ECO  to  concede
   the case some four days before the hearing and the Upper  Tribunal  would
   in any event have to have  given  consent  to  such  withdrawal  for  the
   hearing to be vacated. I therefore made no order for costs.



Conclusions

I remake the decision in this appeal by allowing it.

I make no order for costs.
