                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




    1. The appellant  appeals  with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Juss ('the Judge'), promulgated on 23 October 2019, in
       which the Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds.



Background


    2. The appellant, a male born on 5 May 1980 claims to be  a  citizen  of
       Myanmar which was disputed by the respondent.
    3. The Judge, having had the opportunity of considering written and oral
       evidence, sets out his findings of fact from  [14]  of  the  decision
       under challenge the  relevant  points  of  which  are  summarised  as
       follows:


        a.  The  Judge  was  not   clear   what   point   the   appellant's
           representative were seeking to  make  in  relation  to  previous
           application as a stateless citizen made on 29 December 2015  and
           refused by the respondent on 13 April 2017. The  Judge  was  not
           satisfied the appellant was completely unaware that his 'broker'
           was making an application for him as  a  stateless  person.  The
           Judge refers  to  the  fact  the  appellant  stated  in  written
           submissions that the  respondent  had  failed  to  consider  the
           statelessness of  the  Rohingya  Muslims  in  Rakhine  State  of
           Myanmar. The Judge finds the appellant was responsible  for  the
           application made on his behalf [16].
        b. The Judge considered a Forensic  Science  Report  written  by  a
           Forensic Document Examiner concluding there was limited evidence
           the appellant did not sign the application for leave  to  remain
           dated  22/12/2015  based  on  a  comparison   between   specimen
           signatures and the signature on the application. The  Judge  had
           found the appellant had instructed a 'broker' to regularise  his
           stay  and  that  the  content  of  the   application   was   the
           responsibility of the appellant [17].
        c. The Judge noted the appellant's explanation for being unable  to
           provide background information as being that he  left  his  home
           state  when  he  was  young,  had  a  traumatic  childhood,  and
           disagreed with the respondent's conclusion that he had  provided
           conflicting accounts in relation to the languages he speaks. The
           Judge notes the respondents incredulity  at  how  the  appellant
           could have forgotten his native language in light of  his  claim
           to  have  been  brought  up  solely  in  a   Rohingya   speaking
           environment until the age of 13. The Judge found  the  appellant
           had come the United Kingdom using a forged passport.  The  Judge
           noted the appellant was to be returned to Bangladesh [18].
        d. The Judge takes into account the  country  information  material
           including  the  respondent's  CPIN  and  human  rights   reports
           provided.  The  Judge  finds  the  appellant  is  returnable  to
           Bangladesh where he grew into adulthood and where he worked  and
           that there was no suggestion he will be mistreated  if  returned
           there. The Judge notes the appellant does not  have  a  passport
           but that it is not accepted he is a  Myanmar  national,  but  is
           returnable to Bangladesh, so did not  see  how  evidence  relied
           upon by the appellant regarding  Rohingya  being  returned  from
           other countries assisted him in any way [19].
        e. The Judge found the appellant is not a refugee  as  he  did  not
           establish a well-founded fear of persecution for the reasons  on
           which he based his asylum claim. Accordingly the Judge finds the
           appellant cannot qualify for humanitarian protection [20].
        f. The Judge thereafter  considers  the  appellant's  human  rights
           claim concluding article 3 falls in line with the  dismissal  of
           the protection claim [21].
        g. The Judge concludes the appellant cannot succeed under paragraph
           276ADE Appendix FM and article 8 ECHR for the reasons set out in
           the refusal letter, and in light of it being found there were no
           insurmountable obstacles to  the  appellant  reintegration  into
           Bangladeshi society or exceptional circumstances  sufficient  to
           outweigh the public interest in his removal [22].


    4. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
       another judge of the First-Tier Tribunal, the operative part of which
       is in the following terms:


             1. The core issue in  the  protection  appeal  is  whether  the
                appellant is  a  Rohingya  from  Burma/Mayanma  or,  as  the
                respondent believes, a Bangladeshi national.
             2. The FtTJ noted that there was  a  nationality  dispute  that
                arguably  failed  to  resolve  it.  Instead  it  appears  he
                reasoned from the fact the appellant was able to be returned
                to Bangladesh, which the appellant's  solicitor  denies  was
                the case, that he could not be  at  risk  in  Burma/Mayanma.
                Arguably the FtTJ's reasons are not even "tolerably clear".
             3. Permission is granted to argue all the  grounds  of  appeal,
                although the strongest ground is the one I have indicated. I
                note that the FtTJ has arguably erred in his  assessment  of
                the paragraph 276ADE (1) (vi) ground by misdirecting himself
                to apply the test of 'insurmountable obstacles'.




Error of law


    5. The decision under challenge may not be in the terms  the  author  of
       the appellants grounds would wish to see it, but it  can  be  clearly
       inferred from the Judge's decision that he  rejects  the  appellant's
       claim to be a Rohingya. At [19] the Judge clearly records "and is not
       accepted as being a Myanmar national". The comment the  appellant  is
       returnable to Bangladesh  is  not  the  determinative  issue  but  an
       observation by the Judge in light of the  rejection  of  the  claimed
       nationality.
    6. The Judge rejects the appellant's claim which is based  upon  a  real
       risk he will face as a member of the Rohingya ethnic group,  although
       the Judge also notes there was no credible evidence of  the  Rohingya
       being returned by the Bangladeshi government to Myanmar in any event.
    7. The appellant claimed to be stateless, which was the point of  filing
       the stateless application which was refused by the Secretary of State
       for arguably sustainable reasons, but the Judge does not accept  this
       is so.
    8. The Judge is criticised in the grounds in relation to language issues
       but in respect of that and other issues the Judge writes:


           18.    ... He takes issue with why the SSHD does not accept that
                he is a Rohingya from Myanmar (�7a).  He  then  tackles  the
                reasons given by the SSHD in refusing his application,  that
                he  was  unable  to  provide  background  information,   and
                explains that he left when he was young and 'had a traumatic
                childhood' (�10).  He  particularly  takes  issue  with  the
                allegation that he  had  provided  'conflicting  account  in
                relation to the languages  I  speak',  and  states  that  'I
                explained  that  I  forgot  my  mother  tongue  due  to  not
                practising the language for a prolonged period'  (�11).  The
                SSHD's incredulity at how the Appellant could have forgotten
                his language given that 'I was brought up solely in Rohingya
                speaking environment up until the age of 13' is answered  by
                the Appellant on the basis that 'I left my country of origin
                at an early age....'  (�  12).  He  then  accepts  that  the
                'Rohingya  people  share  a   common   language   with   the
                Chittagonian  Bengali  language  spoken  in  the  Chittagong
                Division of Bangladesh' (�13). As for the fact  that  he  is
                'not able to answer a lot of  questions  regarding  borders,
                currency, location of the village and landmarks of Myanmar',
                explains that 'I have answered all the questions to the best
                of my knowledge....' (�15).  There after he deals  with  the
                'delay  in  Asylum  claim'  and  explains  that  'I  am   an
                illiterate person, and did not know the process for claiming
                asylum in the UK' (�24) and further that,' I am a  layperson
                and did not know I may have [an] asylum claim because of  my
                ethnicity' (�25). As to the allegation against him  that  he
                came to the UK 'with a forged passport' he  states  that  'I
                disagree with the Respondent's assertion and maintained that
                I came to the UK with  the  help  of  an  agent....'  (�26).
                However, this surely does not mean that he  did  not  use  a
                forged passport. He could have both used an Agent and used a
                forged passport, which in fact he did as a matter  of  fact,
                so that it is pointless to deny it. He  then  addressed  his
                further fear on the basis that as a Rohingya from Myanmar he
                would 'face persecution' (�28). Surely, however,  this  only
                applies if he is  being  returned  to  Myanmar  and  not  to
                Bangladesh which is the case here, and also it only  applies
                if the Appellant is a Rohingya (see also �31).


    9. The Judge clearly considered the evidence with the required degree of
       anxious scrutiny before coming to the conclusion that  the  appellant
       had not established a well-founded fear of persecution as he had  not
       established that he was who he claims to be and  therefore  a  person
       entitled to a grant of international protection on that basis.
   10. Whilst the grounds disagree with that conclusion and put forward  the
       appellant's argument as to why the Judge has erred in law the grounds
       fail to establish arguable legal error material to  the  decision  to
       dismiss the appeal. This is not an appeal in which only  one  finding
       was open to the Judge, and in particular that the  only  finding  was
       one in the appellant's favour. The weight to be given to the evidence
       was a matter for the Judge. The  appellant  was  represented  at  the
       hearing by Mr Shah who had  the  opportunity  to  place  any  further
       evidence he was seeking to rely upon before the Judge  or  who  could
       have clarified any points he thought required further submissions. It
       is not made out the Judge did not allow the representatives  to  make
       submissions such as to amount to a procedural error  giving  rise  to
       unfairness. The Judge was entitled to advise  the  parties  of  those
       matters upon which further evidence or submission were required.
   11. Whilst the Judge may not have referred to every part of the  evidence
       made available that does not amount to arguable legal error. As noted
       above, the Judge clearly considered the  evidence.  Adequate  reasons
       have been given in support of the findings of the Judge.  The  weight
       to be given to the evidence was a matter for the Judge.
   12. In terms of the human rights claim, this was  clearly  considered  by
       the Judge. The fact  the  appellant  speaks  English  and  has  never
       claimed public funds as he has worked at an Indian  restaurant  (even
       though he had no lawful right to do so), is no more  than  a  neutral
       factor pursuant to section 117 B  of  the  2002  Act.  The  fact  the
       appellant had been in the United Kingdom for 17 years  and  8  months
       does not entitle him  to  succeed  under  paragraph  276ADE  where  a
       minimum 20 years is required. The  appellant's  stay  in  the  United
       Kingdom has been unlawful throughout. No insurmountable obstacles  to
       the appellant reintegrating into life  in  Bangladesh  was  made  out
       before the Judge. The finding the appellant could not succeed  either
       within or outside the Immigration Rules is clearly a  finding  within
       the range of those available to the Judge on the evidence.
   13. It is not made out the findings made are outside the range  of  those
       reasonably available to the Judge on the evidence such as to  warrant
       the Upper Tribunal  interfering  any  further  in  relation  to  this
       matter.

Decision

   14. There is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
       decision. The determination shall stand.


  Anonymity.


   15. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.


       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
