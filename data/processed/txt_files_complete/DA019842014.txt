Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This appeal comes before me by way of a rehearing to enable the Upper
       Tribunal to consider any further evidence relating to the Appellant's
       ability to reintegrate into the Democratic Republic  of  Congo  (DRC)
       following the Respondent's successful appeal against  a  decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal, dated 12 October  2015,  which  allowed  the
       Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to deport him on
       the basis that his presence was not conducive to the public  good  by
       virtue of Section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971.

    2. In an error of law hearing heard on 14 January 2016 I found that  the
       First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law by failing to  take
       into account the full scope of the relevant public  interest  factors
       in the proportionality assessment encapsulated within  paragraph  398
       of the immigration rules. I additionally found  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal judge's conclusion  that  the  Appellant  was  a  vulnerable
       individual was not supported by the  evidence  before  him.  Nor  had
       there been any consideration of the ability of the  Appellant's  aunt
       and uncle to provide financial or other support to him through remote
       means, or of the Appellant's ability to obtain employment in the DRC.
       The First-tier Tribunal judge also failed to  give  adequate  reasons
       why the Appellant's recently acquired knowledge that he was an orphan
       would impact on his ability to integrate into the DRC.

Background

    3. The Appellant is a national of the DRC. His date of birth is given as
       [ ] 1996. He first entered the United Kingdom on 20 May 2007 as an 11
       year old. He was granted indefinite leave to remain on the  basis  of
       family reunion with DS, his uncle. On 19 February 2013, when  he  was
       16 years old, the Appellant was convicted of wounding with intent  to
       cause grievous bodily harm and of having a blade/article  in  public.
       The incident  involved  a  deliberate  attack  on  a  fellow  student
       resulting in the Appellant slashing the other student across the face
       with a knife leaving a lifelong scar. The Appellant pleaded guilty to
       this offence and received a custodial sentence  of  three  years  and
       nine months' imprisonment in a young offenders' institution.  He  had
       committed other, albeit less serious offences including  offences  of
       theft and breach of a referral order. He had not received  any  other
       custodial sentence.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

    4. The Respondent considered  that  the  Appellant's  presence  was  not
       conducive to the public good and made a decision to deport  him.  The
       Appellant appealed that decision and his hearing was heard on various
       dates in May, July and September 2015. The First-tier Tribunal  judge
       heard evidence from the Appellant, from his aunt JM  and  his  uncle,
       DS. Having considered the evidence from  the  various  witnesses  the
       judge found that the Appellant would not have any fear of persecution
       and/or Article 3 ill-treatment if deported to the DRC on the basis of
       his criminal conviction coupled with the fact that his  uncle  was  a
       recognised refugee. No cross-appeal had been made in respect of  this
       finding.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal judge then considered Article 8.  The  First-
       tier Tribunal judge found that  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the
       requirements of paragraph 399A of the Immigration  Rules  because  he
       had not resided in the United  Kingdom  for  most  of  his  life.  Mr
       Richardson accepted that  this  continued  to  be  the  case.  Having
       arrived in the UK aged 11, the Appellant had been here for  almost  9
       years. At paragraph 49 of his decision the First-tier Tribunal  judge
       found there were "clearly significant obstacles" to  the  Appellant's
       integration in the DRC, chiefly the absence of any social network  to
       support him in that process. In  so  doing  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       judge did not appear to be intending to apply the test  in  paragraph
       398 of the immigration rules which required the  existence  of  "very
       significant obstacles". The First-tier Tribunal judge found that  the
       Appellant had spent the greater part of his 'socially aware life'  in
       this country having been here for all of his teenage  years  and  for
       all of his compulsory secondary education. The  judge  was  satisfied
       that the Appellant had studied and socialised exclusively in English.

    6. The First-tier Tribunal judge accepted that the  Appellant  had  been
       orphaned as a child and grew up regarding his aunt and uncle  as  his
       real parents. It was only in 2011 that the Appellant learnt that  his
       aunt and uncle were not his biological parents. The judge  found,  on
       the basis of the evidence before him at the date  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal hearing, that the  Appellant  did  not  have  any  immediate
       family members in the DRC and accepted  that  his  grandmother,  with
       whom he had lived prior to entering the United Kingdom, was now dead.
       The judge found that the  Appellant's  strongest  ties  were  to  the
       United  Kingdom.  The  judge  found  that  there  was  no   realistic
       possibility that the Appellant's family in the United  Kingdom  could
       relocate to the DRC because his uncle was  a  recognised  refugee.  I
       pause to note that the evidence before the judge indicated  that  the
       Appellant's aunt and uncle were separated but there was  no  evidence
       that his aunt held any fear from the authorities in the DRC.

    7. Although the Appellant was over the age of 18 the First-tier Tribunal
       judge found, again on the evidence before him, that he  had  not  yet
       established an independent life and was said to be still very much  a
       member  of  his  aunt's  household.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
       observed the sentencing  judge's  remarks  to  the  effect  that  the
       Appellant was 'not very  grown  up'  and  considered  this  to  be  a
       reference to his relative immaturity and not simply his chronological
       age. The  sentencing  judge  had  also  described  the  Appellant  as
       "vulnerable",  a  factor  that  played  a  role  in  the   First-tier
       Tribunal's proportionality assessment.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the index offence committed  by
       the Appellant was undoubtedly serious  as  it  involved  the  use  of
       violence and had serious and permanent repercussions for the  victim.
       Having considered the Appellant's background the First-tier  Tribunal
       found that he had fallen in with the wrong crowd and joined  a  gang.
       The First-tier Tribunal judge  found,  again  on  the  basis  of  the
       evidence  before  him,  that  the  Appellant  had  engaged  with  his
       rehabilitation and had not committed any further offences  since  his
       release.

    9. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that the Appellant was a vulnerable
       individual and that having to  start  off  again  in  the  DRC  would
       present considerable challenges to him for which he  would  be  'ill-
       equipped and without proper support from the  significant  adults  in
       his life'. The First-tier Tribunal judge concluded that  the  factors
       militating against the Appellant's deportation outweighed the  public
       interest in his deportation.



The finding of material errors of law

   10. In the error of law hearing I found,  applying  AM  [2012]  EWCA  Civ
       1634, that the Judge failed to take into account or engage  with  all
       relevant  public  interest  factors  such  as  the  need   to   deter
       individuals from committing offences, the need to  express  society's
       revulsion at the commission of serious  offences,  and  the  need  to
       ensure public confidence that offenders are punished. This undermined
       the First-tier Tribunal's proportionality assessment. Nor  had  there
       been particularised reference to section 117C(2) of the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) which requires a court
       or tribunal to take into  account,  when  assessing  proportionality,
       that the more  serious  the  offence,  the  stronger  is  the  public
       interest in removal.

   11. Nor was I satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal judge  was  entitled
       to conclude that the Appellant was a vulnerable individual. The  only
       reference to the term "vulnerable" before the First-tier Tribunal was
       in the Judge's sentencing  remarks.  This  read,  "[the  Appellant's]
       vulnerability is within the gang and because of his membership of  it
       he was vulnerable  from  others  as  well".  It  is  clear  that  the
       sentencing remarks related to vulnerability in  the  context  of  the
       Appellant's  membership  of  a  gang  and   not   to   any   inherent
       vulnerability on his part. The sentencing Judge's  reference  to  the
       Appellant being "not very grown up" and to  being  easily  influenced
       has to be considered in the context of the Appellant as a 16 year old
       and there was no basis for the First-tier Tribunal judge to find,  as
       a 19 year old, that the Appellant was  vulnerable  or  immature.  The
       various certificates provided by  the  Appellant  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal judge were further indications of his growing maturity.

   12. Nor was there sufficient  evidence  that,  as  a  19  year  old,  the
       Appellant enjoyed anything more than normal bonds of  affection  with
       his aunt and his  uncle.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  give
       adequate reasons why the Appellant's recently acquired knowledge that
       he was an orphan would impact on his ability to reintegrate into  the
       DRC. The First-tier Tribunal's conclusion that the Appellant would be
       'ill-equipped and without proper support from significant  adults  in
       his life' was reached without any consideration of the ability of his
       aunt and uncle to provide financial or other support  through  remote
       means. It was apparent from the evidence identified at paragraphs  14
       and 18 of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  that  the  Appellant's
       family in the United Kingdom paid for his grandmother's medical bills
       and sent money for her funeral. Nor was any assessment  made  of  the
       Appellant's skills/qualifications and whether  these,  together  with
       his proficiency in English, would assist him in finding a job in  the
       DRC. I noted in the error of law decision that there was no  evidence
       that the Appellant no longer spoke Lingala.

The rehearing

   13. Although  a  further  bundle  had  been  served  by  the  Appellant's
       representatives, this did not contain any new documents that had  not
       been before the First-tier Tribunal.

   14. The Presenting Officer applied for permission to serve copies of  the
       Appellant's 'Family Reunion Application Detail's and the accompanying
       Interview Record, relating to his application for indefinite leave to
       enter the UK which was made on 10 November 2006. The Respondent  also
       sought permission to serve an OASys Assessment dated 04 November 2014
       made  in  respect  of  the  Applicant.  Mr  Richardson  opposed   the
       application to adduce these documents citing  the  "Ladd  v  Marshall
       principles" (see Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489) and  noting  that
       the documents could have been adduced before the First-tier  Tribunal
       and that the OASys report was only  a  snapshot  of  the  Applicant's
       circumstances at the time  it  was  created.  This  is  an  adjourned
       hearing of an appeal, a material error of have having been  uncovered
       by the Upper Tribunal. The reason it was adjourned was to  allow  the
       provision of further evidence. The Ladd v Marshall principles have no
       application in this context. The documents were both relevant to  the
       issues under consideration. I admitted the  documents  but  indicated
       that any weight I attached to them would be considered  in  light  of
       their provenance and date of creation. Mr Richardson indicated he had
       sufficient opportunity to take account of the documents and  made  no
       application to adjourn the hearing.  Mr  Richardson  then  sought  to
       admit a national Probation Service letter dated 13  April  2016  into
       evidence, which I admitted.

   15. It was accepted by Mr Richardson at the outset of  the  hearing  that
       the  Appellant  could  only  succeed  under  paragraph  398  of   the
       immigration rules if he could show the existence of 'very  compelling
       circumstances' over and above those described in paragraphs  399  and
       399A.

   16. In examination-in-chief the Appellant confirmed that the Applications
       Details document contained his photograph and referred to his  family
       name  as  'Ngobe  Saku'.  The  Interview  Record   accompanying   the
       Applications  Details  document  indicated  that  the  Applicant  was
       accompanied by 'Marie Tsaku, who first claimed to be the aunt of  his
       uncle DS, and then claimed  to  be  DS's  sister.  According  to  the
       interview record the Appellant and his sister called her 'aunt'. When
       the Appellant was asked about this person he said he did not know who
       she was. When asked who else lived with his grandmother  in  the  DRC
       the Appellant said his cousin and a 'few other people'.  One  was  an
       adult but the Appellant could  not  really  remember.  The  Appellant
       claimed he had no contact with anyone else in the DRC since  he  came
       to the UK. He claimed to have no relatives in the DRC.

   17. The Appellant said he had not seen  a  probation  officer  in  the  5
       months prior to his release from custody. Since his  release  he  had
       seen Probation once every week. The three warnings mentioned  in  the
       probation letter produced  by  the  Appellant  related  to  his  late
       attendance at meetings. He  had  never  missed  an  appointment.  The
       Appellant claimed he had a trial in  3  weeks  for  Arsenal  football
       club, and had been accepted  on  a  college  course  to  study  sport
       science. The Appellant also received support from the St Giles trust.
       He no longer saw the people he used to see prior to his incarceration
       and had not committed any other offences.

   18. In cross-examination the Appellant said if  Marie  was  his  aunt  he
       would know about it. The Appellant said that DS did have siblings  in
       the UK. The Appellant did  not  know  all  of  them  personally.  The
       Appellant explained  that  if  he  received  more  than  3  probation
       warnings he would be returned to jail. The Appellant was referred  to
       page 9 of the OASys Assessment. This contained an assertion that  the
       Appellant was a member  of  the  Dem  Africans  (DA)  gang  based  in
       Edmonton. The Appellant said he was never a gang member and had  been
       hanging around with  the  wrong  people.  When  referred  to  another
       section of the OASys report in which a probation officer did not  get
       the impression that the Appellant was remorseful, the Appellant  said
       he was easily influenced and regretted what  he  did.  The  Appellant
       said he had never brought his previous friends to his family home.

   19. The Appellant claimed he 'doesn't really speak French',  although  he
       could understand it. The Appellant was referred to 6.9 of  the  Oasys
       report which indicated that, at  home,  the  family  communicated  in
       French/Lingala. The Appellant claimed he could not speak  Lingala  at
       all. His family spoke to him in Lingala but he claimed he  would  not
       reply in the language. He claimed that he could understand a  bit  of
       Lingala. Another paragraph in 6.9 of the report  indicated  that  the
       Appellant had not wanted to be visited by his aunt while  he  was  in
       custody and rejected her phone calls. Instead the Appellant had tried
       to keep his association with his friends and asked  for  them  to  be
       allowed to  visit.  In  oral  evidence  the  Appellant  denied  this,
       claiming that his family had visited him in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

   20. When examination-in-chief of DS commenced it became apparent that  he
       needed a French or Lingala interpreter. One was eventually  obtained.
       DS claimed he did not know who Marie Tsaku was. DS's mother was quite
       elderly when  the  Appellant  applied  for  entry  clearance  and  DS
       believed his mother probably took Marie Tsaku  to  the  embassy  with
       her. When asked who Marie Tsaku was, DS claimed she was  someone  who
       was helping his mother. When I asked DS  whether  he  knew  of  Marie
       Tsaku he said that he lost everything when he left the DRC  and  that
       he did not have a number for her. When asked who he was referring  to
       DS said he did not know anymore.

   21. In cross-examination DS stated that he sent money to a friend in  the
       DRC to help his mother and the friend told DS that there was  someone
       helping his mother. When DS sent money to his friend, his mother  was
       present. DS would speak to his mother on the  telephone  and  inquire
       about her health. DS confirmed that he was in direct contact with his
       mother. When it was pointed out to  DS  that  Marie  Tsaku  said  the
       Appellant and his cousin were living with her (Q16), DS said  he  did
       not know that and said the Appellant had been living with his  (DS's)
       mother. DS explained that the house in which his mother used to  live
       was the family house. He did not know who looked after it  after  his
       mother died. When asked if he could support the Appellant if deported
       to the DRC DS said it was impossible with a small salary. When  asked
       whether his siblings in the UK could help support  the  Appellant  DS
       said his siblings were actually his cousins. They were  the  children
       of his paternal uncle. He had a  'real'  sister  but  she  died  (the
       Appellant's mother). When I asked DS why he never  asked  his  mother
       about the woman who was helping her, he said that it  never  came  to
       his mind.

   22. In re-examination DS said he was employed by [R L] and his salary was
       �1,000 a month. He lived by himself and paid rent of  �360  a  month.
       His other outgoings included phone, bills, food, travelling,  clothes
       and council tax. After these expenses he had maybe �100.

   23. JM adopted her statement and gave evidence via the interpreter. There
       was no examination-in-chief. In cross-examination JM claimed that  DS
       had a 'blood' brother in the UK. When asked  whether  the  Appellant,
       his cousin and DS's mother stayed in the same property after she (JM)
       left the DRC, JM said that they had left the  family  home  after  DS
       escaped from the DRC and rented a property. JM  claimed  that  no-one
       else lived with DS's mother, the Appellant and his  cousin.  She  had
       never heard of Marie Tsaku and was not aware of  anyone  else  living
       with DS's mother. DS's mother would receive money sent  from  the  UK
       via agencies and she would collect the money herself. DS's mother had
       her own phone, paid for by DS and JM. When asked  whether  she  could
       send money to the Appellant if he was deported, JM said  he  was  too
       young and not self-sufficient. The assertion in the OASys report that
       the Appellant rejected her phone calls and did not want her to  visit
       was not true.

   24. In response to questions from me JM said  that  the  Appellant  could
       previously understand French prior to his time in prison. She claimed
       he did not understand when she tried to speak Lingala. She had  never
       been told about a woman who had helped DS's mother.

   25. I heard submissions from both  representatives  which  I  have  fully
       taken into account.

Findings and reasons

   26. The Appellant was sentenced to a period of more than  12  months  but
       less than  4  years  imprisonment.  The  Appellant  cannot  meet  the
       requirements of paragraph 399A because he has not  lawfully  resident
       in the UK for most of his life. This was not in dispute. Nor  was  it
       in dispute  that  the  Appellant  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of
       paragraph 399 of the immigration rules.  As  such,  and  pursuant  to
       paragraph 398, the public interest  in  the  Appellant's  deportation
       will only be  outweighed  by  other  factors  where  there  are  very
       compelling circumstances over and above those described in paragraphs
       399 and 399A. Following MF (Nigeria) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
       Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 the immigration rules constitute
       a complete code for consideration of Article  8  in  the  context  of
       deportation  decisions.  All  factors  relevant  to  proportionality,
       including, the Maslov criteria, will be  considered  under  paragraph
       398.

   27. I begin, as my starting point, with the retained factual findings  of
       the First-tier Tribunal. I accept that the Appellant has lived in the
       UK since entering in 2007, aged 11, with lawful leave,  and  that  he
       has his strongest ties to the UK. I accept  that  the  Appellant  has
       spent all of his 'socially aware life' in the UK,  and  that  he  has
       studied  and  socialised  exclusively  in  English  and   is   highly
       proficient in the language. I accept that he has integrated into  the
       UK. His proficiency in English  is  a  relevant  consideration  under
       section 117B(2) of the 2002 Act.  I  accept  that  the  Appellant  is
       capable of undertaking remunerative employment and that  he  has  the
       capacity to be  self-sufficient,  a  relevant  factor  under  section
       117B(3).

   28. The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted that the Appellant only learnt
       that DS and JM were not his  biological  parents  sometime  after  he
       arrived in the UK. This acceptance  does  not  sit  comfortably  with
       Marie Tsaku's answer recorded  in  the  Appellant's  entry  clearance
       interview record that the Appellant did know about the death  of  his
       mother prior to entering the UK. I am nevertheless prepared to accept
       the Appellant's claim  that  he  only  became  aware  of  his  actual
       relationship to DS and JM after entering the UK, and  that  this  may
       have had some adverse psychological impact on him.

   29. The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted that  the  Appellant  did  not
       have any immediate family members  in  the  DRC.  For  the  following
       reasons I cannot accept this earlier finding. The First-tier Tribunal
       did not have the benefit of the Appellant's Application  Details  and
       the record of interview relating to his entry  clearance  application
       made at the end of 2006, or the oral evidence  given  in  respect  of
       these documents. At his entry clearance interview the  Appellant  was
       accompanied by someone called Marie Tsaku who  described  herself  as
       his aunt (the sister of DS). The  interview  record  notes  that  the
       Appellant called Marie 'aunt'. It is clear from the interview  record
       that this person had knowledge about  the  Appellant's  circumstances
       (she was aware that the Appellant's mother had died and knew when she
       died; she knew that DS had assumed care  of  him;  she  knew  details
       about the Appellant's cousin; she knew details about the  Appellant's
       aunt and uncle's migration to the UK; she knew that DS  and  JM  sent
       money to the Appellant and was able  to  produce  a  receipt).   This
       suggests that the Appellant had other family members in the DRC other
       than his grandmother, at least in 2006. This however is  inconsistent
       with the evidence produced  to  the  Tribunals  on  his  behalf.  The
       Appellant claimed not to know who Marie  was  despite  the  interview
       record noting that he called her 'aunt'. In  his  oral  evidence  the
       Appellant said that, in addition to him and his cousin, a 'few  other
       people' lived with his grandmother. He claimed not to know  who  they
       were but said one was an adult. This is, to some extent, supported by
       the entry clearance interview record in which Marie Tsaku states that
       the Appellant and his cousin live with her.

   30. I found DS's evidence relating to  Marie  Tsaku  to  be  evasive.  He
       claimed, on the one hand, that Marie was  probably  someone  who  was
       helping his mother when she was elderly. He then said that he did not
       have a number for 'her'. This suggests he had some knowledge of Marie
       Tsaku. When asked to clarify who 'her' was, DS  then  said  "I  don't
       know anymore." DS also stated that he was in direct contact with  his
       mother and would speak to her when he sent money to his friend. If DS
       was in contact with his mother (the Appellant's grandmother), I  find
       it incredible that DS would not have been aware that his mother had a
       woman living with her and helping her.  This  undermines  DS's  claim
       that he has no knowledge of Marie Tsaku.  I  am  reinforced  in  this
       conclusion by reference to the fact that Marie Tsaku was  interviewed
       for the purpose of the Appellant's entry  clearance  application,  an
       application in which DS acted  as  the  sponsor.  I  simply  find  it
       incredible that DS would not be aware of the person accompanying  the
       Appellant to an interview and speaking on  his  behalf  when  he  was
       acting as sponsor. In her oral evidence JM said she was not aware  of
       anyone else living with the Appellant's grandmother  other  than  him
       and his cousin. Given that there was direct  telephone  communication
       between DS and his mother I do not find it credible that JM would  be
       unaware that other people lived with the Appellant's grandmother. For
       these reasons I do not accept the evidence advanced by the  Appellant
       and his witnesses in respect of  the  absence  of  any  other  family
       support in the DRC. I find it more likely than not that the Appellant
       does have relatives living in the DRC.

   31. The First-tier Tribunal found that the Appellant was  vulnerable  and
       immature. For the reasons given at paragraph 11 of this decision I am
       not satisfied that the Appellant is either  vulnerable  or  immature.
       Nor am I satisfied, having regard to Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 630,  that
       there is sufficient evidence that, as a 19 year  old,  the  Appellant
       enjoys anything more than normal bonds of affection with his aunt and
       his uncle. I accept that the Appellant now lives with his aunt, as  a
       term of his bail. But no evidence has been  adduced  to  support  the
       contention  that  there  is  anything  beyond  the  normal  bonds  of
       affection between the Appellant  and  DS  and  JM.  No  evidence  was
       adduced to suggest that the Appellant would  be  unable  to  maintain
       indirect or remote communication with his family in the UK.

   32. There were some general inconsistencies between the evidence given by
       DS and JM. DS first claimed to have siblings in  the  UK,  but  later
       claimed he only had one biological sibling, his deceased sister,  and
       that the 'siblings' he had been referring to were  actually  cousins.
       JM however was quite clear in her evidence  that  DS  had  a  'blood'
       brother in the UK. In his oral evidence DS claimed he  used  to  send
       money to his mother via a friend. In her oral evidence JM stated that
       money was sent to DS's mother via an  agency  and  that  DS's  mother
       would  collect  the  money  herself  from  the  agencies.  There  was
       additionally  discrepant  evidence  as  to  whether  the  Appellant's
       grandmother was living in her family  home  or  rented  accommodation
       when the  Appellant  left  the  DRC.  I  find  these  inconsistencies
       undermine to some extent the general credibility of both witnesses.

   33. In the Appellant's entry clearance interview Marie Tsaku is  recorded
       as having said that his family in the UK (JM and DS) sent him and his
       cousin money, and reference was made to a receipt. In the  First-tier
       Tribunal hearing evidence was given that DS paid for  his  mother  to
       reside in hospital prior to her death and that money was sent for the
       funeral. In his evidence before the Upper Tribunal DS claimed he  had
       a small salary and that it was impossible  for  him  to  provide  any
       financial support to the Appellant. Although DS gave details  of  his
       income and outgoings, and claimed he only had  around  �100  a  month
       after his outgoings, no supporting  evidence  was  produced.  It  was
       therefore impossible to confirm DS's assertions,  despite  the  clear
       terms on which the error of law hearing was  adjourned.  JM,  in  her
       evidence before the Upper Tribunal, stated that  money  was  sent  to
       DS's mother to provide food and accommodation and a  telephone.  When
       asked if she could provide money to the Appellant if he was deported,
       JM did not answer the question and instead said  that  the  Appellant
       was too young to be self-sufficient. Other than  some  old  documents
       from HMRC relating to the award of tax credits to JM, no  independent
       evidence was provided relating to her income and  expenditure.  Given
       that DS and JM were previously able to provide funds to the Appellant
       and his grandmother in the DRC, and in the absence of any independent
       evidence relating to their financial circumstances, and in  light  of
       my concerns as to their general credibility, I am not satisfied  that
       they would be unable to provide at least some funds to the  Appellant
       if deported.

   34. Having considered the evidence  presented  to  me  at  the  adjourned
       hearing, I am not satisfied the Appellant cannot speak or communicate
       in Lingala or French. The Appellant lived in the DRC until he was  11
       years old. In the First-tier Tribunal hearing the Appellant said that
       the only language he spoke for the first 10 years  of  his  life  was
       Lingala. I do not find it likely that the Appellant  would  lose  his
       ability to speak Lingala having spoken only  that  language  for  the
       early formative years of his life. My conclusion is supported by  the
       OASys report which indicated that, at home  in  the  UK,  the  family
       communicated in French/Lingala. In his oral  evidence  the  Appellant
       said he cannot really speak  French  although  he  accepted  that  he
       understood it. DS could not however give his evidence in English  and
       required  a  French/Lingala  interpreter.  This  suggests  that   the
       communication between the Appellant and his uncle would have been  in
       French or Lingala. I am consequently  satisfied  that  the  Appellant
       would be deported to a country in which he is able to communicate and
       where he is familiar with the principle languages, or where he  would
       be able to  re-acquaint  himself  with  the  languages  without  much
       difficulty.

   35. The Appellant is a young, fit and healthy male who,  in  addition  to
       his ability to speak or easily reacquaint himself with either  French
       or Lingala, can speak English. He lived in the DRC for the  first  11
       years of his life and is likely to  have  retained  some  familiarity
       with the culture and  the  customs.  He  has  obtained  a  number  of
       qualifications while in prison, including a BTEC  in  Workskills  and
       Health and safety qualifications, which would assist him in obtaining
       employment in the DRC. Through a combination of his ability to become
       self-sufficient, the probability that his family in the UK  would  be
       able to provide him with some funds, and the probability that he does
       have family in the DRC, I find he would not be rendered destitute  on
       deportation.

   36. The Appellant  maintains  that  he  is  remorseful  for  his  serious
       offence. In his oral evidence the Appellant categorically stated that
       he was never a gang member. The Sentencing Judge however was  clearly
       of the view that the Appellant was  a  member  of  a  gang.  This  is
       further supported by the information provided in  the  OASys  report.
       The Appellant's denial of ever being a gang member is contradicted by
       the aforementioned evidence. I find that the Appellant is  attempting
       to minimalize the extent of  his  previous  criminal  activities  and
       involvement. This indicates he has not  yet  accepted  responsibility
       for his previous actions, undermining his claim to rehabilitation. In
       this regard I additionally note the  comments  in  the  OASys  report
       (12.8) that, although previously expressing remorse, on the  occasion
       the probation officer  met  him  the  Appellant  did  not  give  this
       impression. Although disputed by the Appellant  I  further  note  the
       assertion in the OASys report that the Appellant tried  to  keep  his
       associations with his friends and asked for them  to  be  allowed  to
       visit him when he was jailed. This suggests that, at least  while  he
       was in custody, the Appellant was actively trying to  retain  contact
       with his former  associates.  I  nevertheless  take  account  of  the
       National Probation Service letter dated 13 April 2016 confirming that
       the Appellant has not been charged with any further offences, that he
       positively and that he positively engaged with  Probation,  and  that
       the Appellant reports being motivated to gain employment or training.
       I note however  that  he  does  have  three  warnings  on  file,  the
       Appellant claims for being late.

   37. I take into account the fact that the Appellant was only 16 years old
       when he committed his index offence. I attach significant  weight  to
       the fact that he was a minor when his offence was committed, a  point
       very much in  his  favour  when  assessing  whether  there  are  very
       compelling circumstances over and above those described in paragraphs
       399 and 399A. The Appellant's minority is relevant in respect of both
       his maturity when the offence was committed and  the  possibility  of
       rehabilitation. I additionally take account of the Sentencing Judge's
       remarks  that  the  Appellant  was  immature  when  the  offence  was
       committed and that he was vulnerable within  the  gang  to  which  he
       belonged.

   38. I have additionally considered the  relevant  factors  identified  in
       Maslov v Austria [2008] ECHR 546 including the nature and seriousness
       of the Appellant's criminality, the length of his stay in the UK, the
       time that has elapsed since the commission of his index  offence  and
       his conduct  during  that  period  (no  further  offences  have  been
       committed), and the solidity of his social, cultural and family  ties
       to the UK host country and with the DRC.

   39. I do however note the seriousness of  the  offence,  which  left  his
       victim scarred for life, as reflected in the sentence of three  years
       and nine months' imprisonment in a young offenders' institution.  The
       offence constituted an escalation  in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
       previous history of offending. I take into consideration  the  public
       interest  in  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration   controls
       (section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act), that the  deportation  of  foreign
       criminals is in the public interest (section 117C(1)), and  that  the
       more serious  the  offence  committed,  the  greater  is  the  public
       interest in deportation (section 117C(2)). I take  into  account  the
       public  interest  in  deterring  foreign  criminals  from  committing
       offences  and  the  public  revulsion  in  this  serious  offence.  I
       additionally  take  into  consideration   the   fact   that   neither
       Exceptional 1 nor  Exception  2  in  section  117C(4)  apply  to  the
       Appellant, and  that  the  public  interest  therefore  requires  his
       deportation. Having regard to the Court  of  Appeal  decision  in  SS
       (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550 I note that a foreign criminal's  claim
       to resist deportation on Article 8 grounds needed to be  very  strong
       to prevail over the public interest in deporting foreign criminals.

   40. I am prepared to accept that there are significant obstacles  to  the
       Appellant's integration in the DRC, but,  in  light  of  my  findings
       above and the findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  have  been
       preserved, I am not satisfied these  obstacles  constitute  the  very
       compelling circumstances needed to show that the  decision  would  be
       disproportionate under Article 8 in light of the  significant  public
       interest factors weighing in favour of the Appellant's removal.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made material errors  of  law.  Having  reheard  the
