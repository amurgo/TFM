Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss Panagiotopoulou, Counsel instructed
     on behalf of O'Keefe Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, appeals with permission, against  the  determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Grant) promulgated on 16th October 2014.
     By its decision, the Tribunal dismissed the Appellant's appeal against
    the Secretary of State's  decision,  to  deport  him  from  the  United
    Kingdom.   The  Tribunal  dismissed  his  appeal  on  the  ground  that
    deportation would not breach his rights as a European citizen under the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  ("the  2006
    Regulations") and would not be an  infringement  of  his  rights  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

 2.   The Appellant is a citizen of France born on  27th  June  1993.   The
    background to the  appeal  demonstrates  that  on  3rd  June  2008  the
    Appellant was issued with a registration certificate as an EEA national
    dependant of his mother.

 3. These proceedings arise out of a decision made  by  the  Respondent  to
    make a deportation  order  under  the  deportation  provisions  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  That decision was  made  following
    the Appellant's conviction for an offence of robbery to  which  he  was
    sentenced on 26th March 2012 to  a  two  year  detention  and  training
    order.   That  sentence  was  later  varied  to  one  of   two   years'
    imprisonment in a young offenders institution.  It is  plain  from  the
    schedule of convictions that on 19th August  2012  for  an  offence  of
    battery  he  was  sentenced  to  a  community  order,  cost   of   �85,
    compensation of �100 and an  exclusion  requirement  for  a  period  of
    twelve months and on 20th August 2013 at Snaresbrook  Crown  Court  was
    sentenced for two offences namely  common  assault  committed  on  13th
    January 2012 for which he was sentenced to a period of six months at  a
    young offenders institution to run  concurrently  with  a  sentence  of
    custody in a young offenders institution for a period of two  years  in
    relation to count 2 for harming a  witness  or  juror  with  intent  to
    obstruct, pervert or interfere with  justice  also  committed  on  13th
    January 2012.

 4. The Appellant appealed against the decision to make a deportation order
    and his appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal on 3rd October 2014.
     The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the Appellant's appeal.   Permission
    to appeal was granted by an Upper Tribunal Judge on 3rd November  2014.
    Summarising the grant of permission, the Upper  Tribunal  Judge  stated
    that in relation to Ground  1  it  was  arguable  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  misunderstood  the  Appellant's  offending  and  this  was  a
    material error by reason of the  First-tier  Tribunal  relying  on  the
    Appellant's offending history as a  material  consideration  justifying
    the Appellant's deportation.  As to Grounds  2,  3  and  4,  the  Upper
    Tribunal Judge also found those grounds to have merit making  reference
    to the finding concerning return to Algeria at [20]  when  it  was  the
    case that the Appellant grew up in France and spent his formative years
    there.  The Judge also considered that the findings made by  the  judge
    affected the Article 8 assessment and therefore  permission  to  appeal
    was granted on all grounds advanced on behalf of the Appellant.

 5.   Thus the appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.  At the  hearing  the
    Appellant was represented by Miss Panagiotopoulou and the Secretary  of
    State by Mr Kandola.  She relied  upon  the  grounds  as  drafted.   In
    relation to Ground 1 she submitted that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    made a factual error concerning the Appellant's offending history.   At
    paragraph 13 of the determination, the judge  placed  reliance  on  the
    fact that the Appellant had offended  after  his  release  from  prison
    resulting in a second sentence of imprisonment and that finding led  to
    the conclusion  that  the  Appellant  had  demonstrated  an  escalating
    pattern of offending and showed no respect for the laws of the UK which
    in turn led to the overall conclusion that his removal was justified on
    the grounds of public policy and public security.   The  factual  error
    was further made at [18] where the judge stated that the Appellant  did
    not reform after his  first  sentence  and  imprisonment  but  that  he
    subsequently offended and then served a second period of  imprisonment.
    Furthermore at paragraph [18] the judge noted:

         "There was no evidence before me to suggest that the Appellant  has
         addressed  his  offending  behaviour  and  his   ongoing   criminal
         activities since release for the first offence demonstrate that the
         Appellant has no interest in complying with the laws of the UK."

    Against that background Miss Panagiotopoulou submitted that that was  a
    material mistake in fact because the history demonstrated the Appellant
    had  not  committed  a  further  offence  following  the  sentence   of
    imprisonment but had been serving the sentence until  26th  March  2012
    when he appeared to be sentenced for an offence that had been committed
    previously in January 2012.  It was submitted that such an error in the
    offending history was material  because  it  was  relied  upon  in  the
    judge's  assessment  and  conclusions  that  the  deportation  of   the
    Appellant was  justified  under  Regulation  19  but  also  because  it
    demonstrated in the judge's assessment that he represented  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently  serious  threat  under  Regulation  21(5)(a).
    Furthermore, the materiality of the mistake of fact was established  as
    the judge took into account that evidence to demonstrate his propensity
    to offend and that was based  on  her  mistaken  understanding  of  his
    offending history and that he had offended post his release.  Thus  she
    submitted that the date of the commission of the offences and the order
    in which he had served his sentences had not  been  considered  in  the
    light of the evidence and that the mistakes of fact went to  the  heart
    of her assessment and findings made in the appeal.

 6. As to Ground 2 she submitted that in reaching the conclusions the judge
    erred in failing to have a  balanced  approach  to  the  assessment  of
    proportionality  under  the  EEA  Regulations.   In  this  respect  she
    submitted that at [20] the judge did not  consider  that  the  offences
    were committed when he was a juvenile and further  did  not  take  into
    account his state of  health.   However  in  this  respect  whilst  she
    submitted that the Appellant had disclosed difficulties  with  epilepsy
    and asthma, she conceded that there had been  no  medical  evidence  in
    relation to those issues.  As to Ground 3, it was submitted  that  when
    assessing proportionality under  the  Regulations  the  judge  did  not
    consider the issue of return of the Appellant and at [20] found that if
    the Appellant did not wish to live in France that he  could  return  to
    Algeria where he grew up.  He spent his formative years in Algeria  and
    there would be no reason why he could not live there if he did not wish
    to establish himself in France.  However she submitted,  the  Appellant
    was a French national and  the  proposed  country  of  deportation  was
    France, a country which  he  claims  to  have  no  links  to  thus  she
    submitted the conclusions on proportionality were  also  unsustainable.
    At Ground 4 Miss Panagiotopoulou submitted that  the  approach  to  the
    assessment of proportionality under Article 8 also  disclosed  material
    errors and relied upon the matters set  out  at  paragraphs  9  and  10
    highlighting the matters in which  it  is  said  were  not  taken  into
    account including the Appellant's relationship with his younger sibling
    who was 14 years of age and the relationship between them or considered
    the Appellant's individual rights.

 7. In respect of paragraph 11 of the grounds, there was reference  to  the
    Appellant's propensity to reoffend and  the  assessment  in  the  NOMS1
    Report.  That evidence, it was submitted was relied upon by the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge at paragraph 18.  However that  was  not  the  most
    recent  assessment  and  an  updated  assessment  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant, relevant to his  attempts  at  rehabilitation  and  risk  of
    reoffending had been served by the Probation Officer on the CCD on  2nd
    October 2014 but that information had not  found  its  way  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   Miss   Panagiotopoulou   provided   that
    information to the Upper Tribunal although it had been an annex to  the
    Grounds of Appeal when made.  It could be seen  from  that  information
    that an e-mail was sent to the Criminal Work Flow Team on  2nd  October
    2014, which was the day before the  hearing,  making  reference  to  an
    updated report.  Mr Kandola observed that the  Presenting  Officer  had
    not requested  that  further  information  but  acknowledged  from  the
    information provided that there had been in existence an updated report
    relevant to the issue of propensity and rehabilitation.

 8. After hearing the submissions of Counsel, Mr Kandola on behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State conceded  that  the  determination  did  disclose  a
    material error of law based on the first ground which  related  to  the
    factual errors made in relation to the  Appellant's  offending  history
    and sequence of the events.  He submitted that the error was a material
    one as can be seen from the determination at paragraphs 13  and  18  as
    the judge relied upon the offending history as a material consideration
    to justify the Appellant's deportation under the 2006 Regulations.   He
    further submitted that the conclusions reached on these issues that the
    Appellant  had  reoffended  on  release  and   thus   had   not   shown
    rehabilitation nor had he addressed his reoffending, went to the  issue
    of propensity set out at Regulation 21 therefore further underlined the
    materiality of the factual error.

 9.   In those circumstances there was common ground  between  the  parties
    that the judge had erred in law in a material respect.

10. Thus it is accepted that the Tribunal erred in law.  In  the  light  of
    the concession made on behalf of the Respondent it is now common ground
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made a material  error  of  law  and
    that in those circumstances the decision must be set aside.   In  those
    circumstances, it is necessary only briefly to explain why the Tribunal
    finds that to be the case.

11.   The  judge  has  set  out  her  findings  at  [13]  -  [20]  of   her
    determination.  She found that the removal was justified on grounds  of
    public policy and public security based on the factual evidence  before
    her and at [13] reached the conclusion that the  Appellant  was  a  man
    "who has offended whilst awaiting sentence for a previous  offence  and
    has offended after his  release  from  prison  resulting  in  a  second
    sentence   of   imprisonment".    When   considering   the   issue   of
    proportionality at [17] the judge gave  further  consideration  to  his
    offending history and stated that the  convictions  the  Appellant  had
    received arose out of his own personal conduct and that "subsequent  to
    his period of imprisonment alternatively he had a choice  to  act  with
    respect for the laws of the United Kingdom".  The judge  then  at  [18]
    made further reference to the offending history in the following  terms
    namely:

         "The Appellant has not only reoffended since then  because  he  has
         been detained and his release on bail was only a  matter  of  eight
         weeks ago and I am not  prepared  to  accept  assurances  from  his
         mother or his father of the Appellant himself  that  he  is  now  a
         reformed character.  The Appellant did not reform after  his  first
         sentence and imprisonment, he subsequently offended, a very serious
         offence indeed interfering with  the  witness  and  then  served  a
         second period of imprisonment.  Consequently there is  no  evidence
         before me to suggest that the Appellant has addressed his offending
         behaviour and his ongoing criminal activities  since  release  from
         the first offence demonstrate that the Appellant has no interest in
         complying with the laws of the United Kingdom."

    It is plain from the findings of fact made as both parties  agree,  that
    the assessment of the factual chronology led  the  judge  to  reach  the
    conclusion that he had a  propensity  to  reoffend  thus  supported  the
    conclusion that he presented a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
    threat to the public  to  justify  his  deportation.   However  as  both
    parties have also agreed the chronology of his offending history was not
    that set out or relied upon by the judge.  The Appellant had not in fact
    committed a further offence following a sentence of  imprisonment.   The
    robbery for which he received a two year detention  and  training  order
    was an offence committed on 11th June 2011.  He was  sentenced  on  26th
    March 2012.  The Appellant had not committed a further offence following
    that sentence of imprisonment but was dealt with for a  further  offence
    on 20th August 2013 for an offence that was committed  on  13th  January
    2012.  The Appellant then had not committed a further offence  following
    the sentence imposed on 26th March 2012 because the offence  itself  was
    committed on 13th January 2012.  Whilst it was  open  to  the  judge  to
    reach the conclusion as she did that the offences for which he had  been
    sentenced overall may have demonstrated an  escalation  in  seriousness,
    the overall findings made from the evidence were  based  on  a  mistaken
    view of his offending history which therefore undermined the  assessment
    both under Regulation 19 and Regulation 21.

12. In view of the error of law already established it is not necessary  to
    consider further the other grounds advanced on behalf of the Appellant.
     In relation to paragraph 11 of the grounds, it cannot be an  error  of
    law if the judge had not taken into account evidence which had not been
    placed before her.  It is apparent  that  shortly  before  the  hearing
    there was further evidence of a more  recent  nature  relevant  to  the
    Appellant's  propensity  to  reoffend   and   whether   the   Appellant
    represented a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  to  the
    public which would justify his deportation.  This information came from
    his Probation Officer as the Appellant has  been  released  on  licence
    and therefore is subject to the supervision  of  a  Probation  Officer.
    The material referred to in the e-mail and screen shot  made  reference
    to his progress in the community and work undertaken with the Probation
    Service including that of the Thinking Skills Programme and his present
    progress.  As I have stated this information, although in existence was
    not made available to the judge. However as both parties  have  invited
    the court to set aside the decision and to  remit  the  matter  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for factual findings to be made in relation to  his
    offending  history   and   the   other   matters   outlined   by   Miss
    Panagiotopoulou, that evidence should be made available to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

13.  Therefore  it  is  common  ground  between  the   parties   that   the
    determination should be set aside and that a new hearing be convened to
    hear the case de novo.  In the light of the nature of the errors of law
    and the issues identified, factual findings  are  required  upon  those
    issues and thus some evidence  would  be  required  from  the  relevant
    parties.  In those circumstances I am satisfied  that  the  appropriate
    course is to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor  House
    to a different judge to consider the oral evidence of the parties,  and
    to make factual findings necessary on the relevant issues.   This  will
    include the up-to-date probation report.

14. Therefore the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside, none of
    the findings of facts shall stand and the case it to be remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal for a hearing in accordance with  Section  12(2)(b)
    of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act at paragraph  72  and  the
    Practice Statement of 10th February 2010 (as amended).  To that end,  I
    make the following directions:-

      i) The Respondent should file and serve on  the  parties  and  on  the
         Tribunal a copy of  the  most  recent  Probation  Officer's  Report
         relevant to the Appellant within 21 days  of  this  decision  being
         served.

     ii) The Secretary of State should provide a chronology  concerning  the
         offences and the circumstances of the offences  committed  on  13th
         January 2012 relating to  common  assault  and  the  harming  of  a
         witness or juror with intent to obstruct, pervert or interfere with
         justice.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside  and
the appeal is remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  set  out  in  the
preceding paragraph.

No anonymity direction is made.
