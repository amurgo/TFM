For the Appellant:     Mr A Pipe, instructed by Khan & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Wardle, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Charity Rambayi, was born on 6 November 1953 and  claims
    to be a citizen of Zimbabwe.  She arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    January 2005 and claimed asylum.  She appealed against the  refusal  of
    her claim for asylum in a  decision  to  remove  her  from  the  United
    Kingdom to Judge Shimmin who dismissed her appeal  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 12 April 2012.  The appellant made fresh representations
    leading to a further decision by the respondent, refusing her claim for
    asylum directing her removal, dated 25  October  2012.   The  appellant
    appealed against  that  decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Hindson) which, in a determination dated 7 February 2013, dismissed the
    appeal on all  grounds.   The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal which refused permission subsequently to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    (Judge Coker) which granted permission to appeal on 8 April 2013.

 2. Judge Coker's grant of appeal rejects several of the grounds raised  by
    the appellant.  In particular, she found that it was  "incorrect"  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  considered  the  findings  of  Judge
    Shimmin as a "end point" rather than "a starting  point"  for  his  own
    analysis.  She did, however, find that

         "there does appear to be a paucity of reasoning in relation to  the
         finding that the appellant is a ZANU-PF  supporter.   There  is  no
         requirement that a determination makes a finding on each and  every
         element of evidence,  this  finding  does  form  the  core  of  the
         reasoning for dismissal of the claim.  It is  arguable  that  there
         was an error in the determination,  although  to  one  extent  this
         benefits the  appellant  is  questionable  given  the  most  recent
         country guidance".

 3. Representing the appellant  before  the  Upper  Tribunal,  Mr  Pipe  of
    Counsel advanced the case on the ground of the paucity of reasoning  as
    to the appellant's ZANU-PF membership.  At [49], Judge Hindson wrote:

         "I am not satisfied that the appellant has told the truth about her
         political allegiances.  I find the appellant is a genuine supporter
         of ZANU-PF as is family in Zimbabwe.  I accept that she has been in
         the UK for about eight years and it may well be that she is not 'up-
         to-date' with the current  ZANU-PF  slogans  and  songs  but  I  am
         satisfied that [she] should be readily able to update herself  with
         the help of her family prior to returning.   She  would  return  to
         Harare where she has many family members and will be  readily  able
         to integrate there as a genuine and active supporter of ZANU-PF."

 4. I agree with Mr Pipe that it is difficult to see where exactly  in  the
    determination Judge Hindson gives reasons for  reaching  that  finding.
    At [47],  he  noted  that  the  appellant's  sister,  Sharon,  "visited
    Zimbabwe on a number of occasions without any difficulty" and that "the
    appellant's case is the family have avoided problems [in  Zimbabwe]  by
    carrying ZANU-PF membership cards and "going along  with"  ZANU-PF  and
    other reason than to avoid problems.  She now denies  being  a  genuine
    ZANU-PF supporter and says that "it is  very  common  in  Zimbabwe  for
    people to take this pragmatic step in order to have access to food  and
    so on which might otherwise be denied them".  It is possible that Judge
    Hindson reached his finding because he had found that  the  appellant's
    account was not true [48].  It therefore followed that the  appellant's
    claim to have only pretended to be a member of ZANU-PF was rejected  by
    the judge and therefore the fact  that  she  had  membership  cards  in
    Zimbabwe (as did members of her family) can only be explained by reason
    of the fact that  they  were  genuine  supporters  of  that  party.   I
    consider the determination,  read  as  a  whole,  is  just  capable  of
    supporting that reasoning, though it would have been far preferable  if
    Judge Hindson had inserted at [49] explicit reasons  for  reaching  his
    finding as to the appellant's ZANU-PF membership.  I  find  that  Judge
    Hindson did not err in  law  reaching  the  findings  set  out  in  the
    determination and in particular at  [49]  and  that  his  reasoning  is
    adequate.

 5. Even if I am wrong in reaching that finding and the judge  did  err  in
    law by giving inadequate reasons to justify  his  findings  at  [49]  I
    would decline Mr Pipe's invitation to set aside the determination.   As
    Judge Coker noted when giving permission,  as  Mr  Wardle  has  rightly
    noted in his Rule 24 letter of 31 July 2013,  country  guidance  of  CM
    [CNL to insert reference]  upholding  [for  the  minor  amendment]  the
    country guidance of EM is sufficient to defeat the appellant's  appeal.
    Mr Wardle's letter quotes from  CM  at  paragraph  234  (the  appellant
    previously lived in the Hatfield district of Harare):

         CNL to insert paragraph 234 of CM

 6. I also understand that the appeal against the Upper Tribunal's decision
    in CM has failed in the Court of  Appeal  where  Laws  LJ  gave  an  ex
    tempore judgment dismissing the appeal.  Even if the appellant is  only
    a "pretend" member of ZANU-PF, it is clear  that  does  not  possess  a
    profile such as would expose her to risk upon return to her  home  area
    of Zimbabwe in the light of EM and CM.

DECISION

 7.  This appeal is dismissed.
