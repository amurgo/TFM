For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, SFRT, was  born  in  1985  and  is  a  male  citizen  of
    Portugal.  By a decision promulgated on 21 August 2018, Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Hanson found that the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Ince) had  erred
    in law such that his decision fell to be set aside.   His  reasons  for
    reaching that decision were as follows:

         "1.  The Secretary of State appeals with permission a  decision  of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ince  ("the  Judge")  who  allowed  this
         appeal against an order for  SFRT's  deportation  from  the  United
         Kingdom pursuant to Regulation 27  Immigration  (European  Economic
         Area) Regulations 2016.


         Background


         2.   SFRT is a citizen  of  Portugal  born  on  3  March  1985.  He
         appeared in person before the  Judge  who  in  the  decision  under
         challenge sets out a number of pages  of  legal  provisions  before
         setting out findings of  fact  from  [46]  of  the  decision  under
         challenge.


         3.   The Judge notes in [49] that the conviction which led  to  the
         deportation decision is serious being two counts of cultivation  of
         a Class B  drug  for  which  SFRT  was  sentenced  to  3  �  years'
         imprisonment and that such is capable of  representing  a  genuine,
         present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
         fundamental interests of society. The Judge finds at the time  SFRT
         committed the offence and was sentenced his conduct  satisfied  the
         requirements of Regulation 27(5).  The  Judge  goes  on  to  remind
         himself, however, that the question before the First-tier  Tribunal
         was whether it now represents a current threat  which  is  "genuine
         and present".


         4.   The Judge refers to an OASYS report at [50] in  the  following
         terms:


             50.  I find that the OASYS report indicates that the Appellant
             has,  at  the  very  least,  begun  his  rehabilitation.   The
             reservation expressed in the report relates to the  fact  that
             at the time of committing the offences he did not consider the
             effect of such on others, be they the potential victims of his
             criminality or his family. However,  the  report  went  on  to
             confirm  that  he  now  understood  those  consequences.   His
             evidence before me confirmed this impression  and  gave  clear
             insight  into  the  reasons  for  this  development.  When  he
             commenced his  offending  his  experiences  of  "family"  were
             negative and he had felt  rejected;  however,  his  subsequent
             experiences of JL, her children and their child made him  feel
             wanted and loved and he therefore understood the  consequences
             of his offending, not only in relation to his new  family  but
             also in relation to the potential victims of  his  actions  in
             cultivating cannabis. I am therefore  led  to  the  conclusion
             that he is a reformed character, has rehabilitated himself and
             that the risk of him reoffending is significantly low.


         5.   At [52] the Judge finds that due to  SFRT's  newfound  insight
         the threat potentially  posed  by  him  is  neither  "genuine"  nor
         "present".


         6.   The Judge goes on  to  consider  the  proportionality  of  the
         decision noting SFRT's circumstances and lack of any impediment  to
         him returning to Portugal before writing at [56]:


             56.  Were that all that could be taken into account,  I  would
             have no hesitation in concluding that the Appellant should  be
             deported. However, there is the fact that he  has,  since  his
             arrest,  developed  a  strong  family  life.  The   Respondent
             conceded in her refusal letter that she was satisfied that the
             relationship between the Appellant  and  JL  was  genuine  and
             subsisting and that it was developed at a time when he  had  a
             right to be here. In addition, I find that, having  heard  and
             seen more evidence on the subject than the decision maker  had
             before her/him, I am satisfied that the Appellant has a  close
             and parental relationship with all three children. The letters
             from the two oldest children testify as to the  reliance  they
             place upon him and to the fact  that  they  regard  him  as  a
             father figure and, in B's case, the only father figure he  has
             had. That dependency was developed whilst he was on  bail  and
             continued during  his  imprisonment  with  them  visiting  him
             several times.


         7.   The Judge goes on to find the disruption to family life  would
         not be  in  the  best  interests  of  the  children  and  that  the
         proportionality of the  decision  falls  more  in  the  appellant's
         favour  "but  perhaps  not  sufficiently,  by  itself,  to  justify
         allowing the appeal".


         8.   What appears to be the determinative  factor  so  far  as  the
         Judge is concerned is set out [60] which is the finding  that  SFRT
         is a reformed character who has  rehabilitated  himself  and  poses
         little risk of reoffending as a result of which the scales  tip  in
         his favour sufficient to conclude that his deportation would not be
         proportionate.


         9.   The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal  which  was
         granted by a Designated Judge of the Upper Tribunal on the basis it
         is  said  the  grounds  of  appeal  are  arguable  as  the  Judge's
         conclusions are  not  easy  to  follow  and  appear  to  have  been
         excessively  influenced  by  an  OASY's  report  rather   than   an
         application of the relevant EEA Regulations.


         Error of law


         10.  It was submitted on the Secretary of States  behalf  that  the
         Judge erred in law as the only reason given for finding  in  SFRT's
         favour is that he is now a reformed and rehabilitated character,  a
         conclusion stemming from the OASY's  report,  whereas  that  report
         does not determine the issue.


         11.  The Secretary of State argues that the report is flawed as  is
         based on information provided by  SFRT,  who  has  chosen  to  omit
         information which may have  led  to  a  different  conclusion,  for
         example at section 2.12 not recording that SFRT had a previous drug
         offence for which he was convicted whilst he was in the  Portuguese
         army which distorts the finding at 2.14  that  there  has  been  no
         escalation in the seriousness of his offending and at 4.4 that this
         shows the discipline received while serving in the army, which  the
         Secretary States claims was not the case.  It is  said  the  report
         also contains conflicts referring to a statement by SFRT  recording
         at [9] of the decision under challenge that he was  brought  up  by
         his grandmother whereas at 6.3 of the report it is claimed  it  was
         his mother. The Secretary and State also challenges an  anomaly  at
         section 11 of the report which records SFRT  is  not  an  impulsive
         individual (despite allegedly accepting a �20,000  loan  from  some
         Russians he had just met in a pub) and that his current offence  of
         cultivating cannabis was pre-planned and thought  out,  or  he  was
         threatened at gunpoint to do so, that he cannot stand violence  yet
         joined the army and claims he was recruited to  serve  five  years,
         including within special forces.


         12.  The grounds argue had the author of the report been  aware  of
         SFRT's  true  history  and  previous  drug-related  offending   the
         propensity to  reoffend  might  have  been  considered  higher  and
         different conclusions reached. Even if the offence leading  to  the
         deportation decision was  the  first  UK-based  offence  there  was
         clearly an offence of a similar nature on a previous occasion.


         13.  It was also argued that SFRT was only released from custody in
         December 2017 and that insufficient time  had  passed  for  him  to
         demonstrate that he was a fully reformed character. At the hearing,
         it emerged that licence conditions still apply  until  the  end  of
         2019, making it highly unlikely SFRT will be anything other than  a
         model citizen; if only to avoid having to return to prison.


         14.  The Judge arguably fails to give adequate  reasoning  for  how
         family life which  existed  throughout  a  period  of  considerable
         separation, as a result of imprisonment, is sufficient to  dissuade
         SFRT from committing further offences. There is clearly the element
         of a desire for financial gain and the report sets out this  was  a
         planned exercise to enable SFRT to obtain money.  The  consequences
         of the cultivation and supply of cannabis must be  known  to  SFRT,
         yet the Judge  fails  to  provide  adequate  reasons  for  how  his
         testimony of being a reformed character was sufficient to  tip  the
         balance in his favour or to examine what  may  happen  if  SFRT  is
         unable to secure work to fund his lifestyle.


         15.  SFRT also started  his  criminality  within  three  months  of
         arrival in the UK and then spent the majority of his time either in
         prison or custody.  The  respondent  disputes  the  finding  SFRT's
         partner will be unable to seek employment in  Portugal.  She  is  a
         Polish national who has travelled and settled in the UK  who  could
         exercise rights of free movements to Portugal with the children who
         have only been in the UK for a limited time and would not be unable
         to adapt to life in Portugal.


         16.  SFRT was asked at the hearing why he had failed to mention his
         previous convictions for drug-related offences in Portugal  to  the
         Probation Officer preparing the report and he failed to  provide  a
         satisfactory explanation. He claimed he was only  driving  the  car
         when the Portuguese offence was committed but accepts that  he  was
         convicted; although claims  he  was  not  charged  until  after  he
         completed his national  service  with  the  Portuguese  army.  SFRT
         claims that he was young when he committed the offence and accepted
         his involvement in it and claims he has learnt his lesson and  that
         he and his partner need him to be in the United Kingdom.


         17.  Having considered the evidence and decision and  having  heard
         submissions from both parties I am satisfied  that  the  Judge  has
         erred in law in a manner material to  the  decision  to  allow  the
         appeal for the reasons set out in the Secretary States grounds  and
         the grant of permission to appeal.


         18.  I am not satisfied SFRT forgot he had been convicted of a drug-
         related offence in Portugal and I find  his  failure  to  tell  the
         Probation Officer preparing the OASYS report of this conviction  is
         indicative of a deliberate act by him to attempt  to  minimise  the
         consequences  of  his  offending  behaviour.  The  report  asked  a
         specific question of SFRT regarding offence at 2.12 relating  to  a
         pattern of offending where the author of the report writes:


             "[SFRT] has no recorded convictions against him in the  United
             Kingdom, however during his presentence  report  interview  he
             was open and honest in discussing that  he  has  a  number  of
             previous convictions in Portugal from when he was younger.  He
             was unable to be specific in their type  and  number,  however
             disclosed that they were of an  acquisitive  nature  including
             theft and robbery. This disclosure may evidence a  pattern  of
             behaviour that is linked to [SFRT's] finances. His  disclosure
             in relation to  an  offence  of  robbery  would  suggest  that
             current offences are not deemed an escalation in seriousness.


         19.  There is no evidence the author of the  report  undertook  any
         enquiries with the authorities in Portugal to establish the details
         of the offences committed in that country. Had the  author  of  the
         report done so, the previous drug-related offences would have  been
         revealed.


         20.  I find the Judge has erred in law  in  a  manner  material  to
         decision to allow the appeal. I set aside that decision.


         21.  The appellant's immigration history  and  offending  behaviour
         shall be preserved findings. SFRT referred to the  fact  he  has  a
         supervising Probation Officer and may care to consider whether that
         individual will be willing to provide a report which may assist the
         Tribunal in assessing the matter on the next occasion.  In  such  a
         report the opinion of the author might be provided in  relation  to
         the risk of reoffending in light of all the offences for which SFRT
         has  been  convicted,  including  the  drug-related  conviction  in
         Portugal.


         22.  The following directions shall apply to the  next  hearing  of
         this appeal:


             i.   List for a Resumed Hearing before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
             Hanson on the first available date  after  1  September  2018.
             Time estimate three hours.


             ii.  The appellant shall, no later than  14  days  before  the
             date of the  next  hearing  provide  an  up-to-date  statement
             setting out details of his history, specific  details  of  all
             offences  committed  by  him  in  Portugal,  dates   of   such
             convictions, and sentences received,  details  of  his  family
             life within the United Kingdom, and his reasons why he  should
             not be deported as a result of his  offending  in  the  United
             Kingdom. The appellant's partner must also provide a statement
             setting out her position in relation to the family composition
             and family life enjoyed in the United Kingdom and  the  impact
             upon her the children if the appellant were  to  be  deported.
             The statements must be signed and dated and shall stand as the
             evidence in chief of the maker who shall be cross-examined  by
             the attending Presenting Officer on  the  basis  of  the  case
             presented by the appellant and his witness.


             iii. The respondent shall provide any further  information  he
             intends to  rely  upon,  including  information  that  may  be
             obtained from Portugal in relation to the appellant's previous
             offences, no later than 14 days before the date  of  the  next
             hearing.


             iv.  Any letter provided by the appellant's Probation  Officer
             in support of his case must be provided to both  the  tribunal
             and the Presenting Officer no later than 14  days  before  the
             date of the next hearing. If, following receipt  of  any  such
             letter, the Presenting Officer requires the attendance of  the
             Probation Officer at the hearing notice must be given  to  the
             appellant  and  the  Probation  Officer  directly  to   ensure
             appropriate arrangements may be made.


             v.   A Portuguese and Polish interpreter may be required.  The
             appellant shall contact the listing team  at  Field  House  to
             confirm his interpreter requirements  upon  receipt  of  these
             directions.


         Decision


         23.  The First-tier Judge materially erred in law. I set aside  the
         decision of the original Judge. The appeal shall be  listed  for  a
         further hearing before the Upper Tribunal to allow that tribunal to
         substitute a decision to either allow or dismiss the appeal."


 2. Following the making of  a  transfer  order,  I  heard  the  appeal  at
    Bradford on 6 December 2018.  The  appellant  appeared  in  person  and
    spoke in English.  His partner, JL, also  appeared  and  gave  evidence
    with the assistance of a Polish interpreter.  Mrs Pettersen,  a  Senior
    Home Office Presenting Officer, appeared for the respondent.

 3. The appellant's appeal falls to be considered under paragraph 27 of the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016:

         '27  (1) In this regulation, a "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
             decision  taken  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health.


             (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken  to  serve  economic
             ends.


             (3)  A relevant decision may not be  taken  in  respect  of  a
             person with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15
             except  on  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  and   public
             security.


             (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-


                  (a)  has a right of permanent residence  under  regulation
                  15 and who  has  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
                  continuous period of at  least  ten  years  prior  to  the
                  relevant decision; or


                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
                  is in the best  interests  of  the  person  concerned,  as
                  provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the  Child
                  adopted by the General Assembly of the United  Nations  on
                  20th November 1989(1).


             (5)  The public policy and public security requirements of the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise  conferred
             by these Regulations  in  order  to  protect  the  fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision  is  taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-


                  (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                  proportionality;


                  (b)   the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                  personal conduct of the person concerned;


                  (c)  the personal conduct of the person must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;


                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;


                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision;


                  (f)  the decision may be taken  on  preventative  grounds,
                  even in the absence of  a  previous  criminal  conviction,
                  provided the grounds are specific to the person.


             (6)  Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
             public policy and public security  in  relation  to  a  person
             ("P") who is resident in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision
             maker must take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,
             state of health, family  and  economic  situation  of  P,  P's
             length of residence in the  United  Kingdom,  P's  social  and
             cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of
             P's links with P's country of origin.


             (7)  In the case of a relevant decision taken  on  grounds  of
             public health-


                  (a)  a disease that does not have  epidemic  potential  as
                  defined by the relevant instruments of  the  World  Health
                  Organisation or is not a disease listed in Schedule  1  to
                  the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations  2010(2);
                  or


                  (b)  if the person concerned is in the United Kingdom, any
                  disease occurring after the three month  period  beginning
                  on the date on which the  person  arrived  in  the  United
                  Kingdom,


             does not constitute grounds for the decision.'


 4. The appellant does not enjoy any enhanced form of protection under  the
    2016 Regulations.  He entered the United Kingdom in September 2014.  He
    lives with JL who has two children by previous relationships, DL  (born
    2006) and BL (born 2007).  Both children  were  born  in  Poland.   The
    children and JL are Polish citizens.  The appellant and JL have a child
    of their own who is now 3 years old.

 5. Details of the appellant's offending in the United Kingdom are set  out
    in Judge Hanson's decision (see above, in  particular,  [3]).   In  his
    evidence to me at the resumed hearing, the appellant told  me  that  he
    had committed his first offence when living in Portugal aged about  16-
    17 years  old.   The  offence  involved  possession  of  cannabis.   He
    received a two years' suspended sentence and a 500 euro fine for having
    "stolen something in the street" in 2006.  He admitted that he had used
    drugs in the past when he was "young".  He now claims not to use  drugs
    at all.  The appellant told me that he  would  be  unable  to  live  in
    Poland because he could not speak Polish and that he would only  obtain
    "bad work" with a low salary.  JL and the children would be  unable  to
    travel with him to live in Portugal because  the  children  only  speak
    English and do not speak Portuguese.

 6. JL gave evidence in Polish.  He was assisted by  an  interpreter.   She
    came to the United Kingdom in 2014.  She  told  me  the  children  were
    "scared to go to Poland".

 7. Mrs Pettersen produced an  email  dated  6  December  2018  from  Emily
    Wheeldon who is the temporary offender manager for the appellant.   Her
    email confirms that the appellant had told her or her  colleagues  that
    he had "committed the offence [the index offence involving  cultivation
    of cannabis] due to financial restraints".  The email states  that  the
    appellant is "willing to overlook his lawful obligations and  means  of
    acquiring funds to sustain his  lifestyle".   He  was  assessed  by  Ms
    Wheeldon as a "medium risk of offending".  That assessment was based on
    the fact that the appellant had committed offences when in Portugal and
    also "because the index offence indicates a period of offending over  a
    prolonged period of time".  The risk would increase  if  the  appellant
    relapsed into his "problematic drug use".  I  note  the  appellant  was
    released from custody in the United Kingdom in December 2017.

 8. I find that it is premature for the Tribunal to  be  able  to  conclude
    that he is a reformed character, as he claims, and  that  he  will  not
    reoffend.  I did find him evasive regarding his previous  offending  in
    Portugal and I am not persuaded that the Tribunal has been given a full
    picture of that offending.  I accept that the appellant lives  with  JL
    and the children, one of whom is his own natural child.  However, I  do
    not accept that the family life is particularly  strong  given  that  a
    significant proportion of the young lives of these children  have  been
    spent whilst the appellant has been in custody.  I find also  that  the
    appellant commenced criminality in  the  United  Kingdom  within  three
    months of his arrival here.  I agree with Judge Hanson  [18]  that  the
    appellant has deliberately sought to  conceal  previous  offending,  in
    particular his drug-related offence  in  Portugal,  in  an  attempt  to
    minimise the consequences of his offending here in the United  Kingdom.
    He has sought to conceal the true level of his offending from the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge and also the Probation Service.

 9. In the light of my findings, I am not satisfied that the  appellant  is
    integrated to any significant degree in  British  society.   The  speed
    with which he committed offences having arrived in this country is,  in
    my opinion, an indication of the attitude he has adopted  to  the  laws
    and society in general in the United Kingdom.

10. As regards Article 8 ECHR, I am satisfied from  the  evidence  which  I
    have read and that which I heard at the resumed hearing that  it  would
    be reasonable to expect the  appellant  and  the  children  and  JL  to
    relocate to either Portugal or Poland.  The only obstacles which either
    adults were able to  indicate  might  exist  were  connected  with  the
    language; the appellant does not speak Polish and JL and  the  children
    do not speak Portuguese.  I  find  that  those  difficulties  could  be
    overcome relatively easily and do not  indicate  a  level  of  hardship
    which comes close to suggesting that the family need as of necessity to
    remain living in the United  Kingdom  to  maintain  their  family  life
    together.  Given my findings, the appellant does  not  succeed  in  any
    appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

11. In conclusion, therefore, I find that this appellant  is  a  Portuguese
    national who is not entitled to any level of enhanced protection  under
    the 2016 Regulations as an EU citizen,  who  has  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom with a view  to  offending  for  profit,  committed  a  serious
    offence relating to drugs and has not been wholly truthful with  either
    the Tribunal or the probation authorities who, nonetheless, regard  him
    as being at medium risk of reoffending.  The obstacles which he and the
    witness JL have identified which they say would prevent the family from
    relocating to Portugal or Poland (the country of JL's nationality)  are
    not, in my view, significant obstacles at all and I  find  that  family
    life may be  continued  in  either  of  those  jurisdictions.   In  the
    circumstances, the appellant's appeal is dismissed.
