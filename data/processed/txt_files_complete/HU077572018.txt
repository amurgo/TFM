                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  ("the  Department")
    appeals from the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Shamash who in a
    decision promulgated on 27 June 2018 gave her reasons for allowing  the
    human rights appeal of the claimant, whose application for ILR  on  the
    grounds of continuous lawful residence for a  period  of  at  least  10
    years had been refused on the sole ground that  a  general  ground  for
    refusal applied.  The Department asserted that  Rule  322(5)  was  made
    out, namely the undesirability of permitting the  person  concerned  to
    remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct, character  or
    associations or the fact  that  he  represents  a  threat  to  national
    security.  The Judge found that the Department had failed to  discharge
    the burden of establishing that the appellant  was  part  of  a  scheme
    designed to obtain Tier 1 visas by deception.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 13 September 2018 First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mark  Davies  granted
    permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         "It is arguable that the Judge placed undue weight on the fact that
         there were acquittals in the criminal proceedings connected to  the
         appellant without giving full or proper consideration as to whether
         the appellant had utilised deception."

Relevant Background

 3. The claimant is a national of Bangladesh, whose  date  of  birth  is  1
    January 1983.  He came to the UK on  25  July  2006  with  valid  entry
    clearance as a student.  He extended his stay in the UK in the capacity
    of a student until 24 November 2012.  On 5 November 2012 he applied for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  migrant.   The  application
    was eventually  refused  on  2  July  2015.   The  Department  was  not
    satisfied that he had genuinely taken over or established a business in
    the UK, or that the money purportedly at his disposal had been  or  was
    going to be genuinely invested in the business, or that he actually had
    any money genuinely at his disposal.

 4. The claimant's appeal  against  this  refusal  came  before  Judge  Lal
    sitting at Hatton Cross on 8 June  2016.   Both  parties  were  legally
    represented.  In his subsequent brief decision, Judge Lal said that  he
    had considered the evidence with some  care,  and  on  balance  he  was
    prepared to accept that the material  now  provided  by  the  appellant
    dealt with the concerns raised by the Department, including  access  to
    UK funds.  He found that the claimant had given a credible  explanation
    as to how he was able to pay off his business partner when  the  latter
    left the business.  He also accepted the claimant's explanation  as  to
    how he was able to work full-time at Sainsbury's at the  same  time  as
    being a genuine entrepreneur.  The Judge  accepted  his  oral  evidence
    that, with the purchase of an operating system for �29,000,  in  effect
    the business was run remotely as it was a web-based business  operating
    through an App:

         "The Tribunal noted  the  evidence  of  Paypal  payments  into  the
         business from online purchases which would suggest  that  customers
         are accessing this service."

 5. Judge Lal went on to  allow  the  appeal,  and  his  decision  was  not
    challenged by the  Department.  Instead,  the  Department  granted  the
    claimant leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) migrant from 12 May
    2017 until 12 May 2020.  In the meantime, the claimant, having  accrued
    10 years' continuous lawful residence as of 25 July 2016,  applied  for
    ILR on that basis shortly  after  the  10  year  anniversary  had  been
    reached, and in September 2017 he dissolved the company  through  which
    he had operated the business.

 6. As previously stated, the sole ground of refusal was that  Rule  322(5)
    applied.   The  Department  relied  on  the  connection   between   the
    claimant's company, Ourtel Ltd and (1) ABC  Bookkeeping  &  Accountancy
    Ltd ("ABC"), (2) its principal, Ashraf Pervez and (3)  other  companies
    connected with him and/or ABC.

 7. ABC had registered over 325 companies at Companies  House,  and  80  of
    these had been identified as  having  been  used  in  numerous  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) applications.  31 out of these  80  companies  had  been
    formally investigated so  that  the  money  flow  from  them  could  be
    identified.  The  money  flow  from  the  companies  was  found  to  be
    supporting Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) leave to remain applications that were
    being fraudulently made to the Home Office.  One of the companies  thus
    identified and investigated was the  claimant's  company,  Ourtel  Ltd.
    The investigation had shown that the companies were sold as packages to
    applicants.   The  package  included:  company  registration;  a   bank
    account; the loan of the necessary �50,000 for a matter of a few  days;
    business plans; marketing material; service or  sales  agreements;  and
    accountancy  material  purporting  to  show  the  shareholding  of  the
    applicants.  There was also evidence to show that  applicants  such  as
    the claimant were paying �7,000 for this service.

 8. The Department then went on to  give  a  detailed  account  of  various
    transactions between the claimant and Ourtel Ltd, on the one hand,  and
    Ashraf Pervez, ABC and connected companies, on the other hand.

 9. As rightly identified by  Judge  Shamash,  the  account  given  in  the
    refusal decision was a digest of a longer account given at pages  23-26
    of a lengthy witness  statement  made  by  Immigration  Officer  Andrew
    Lintern on 21 December 2016 in support of  a  criminal  prosecution  of
    Ashraf Pervez and others on  a  charge  of  conspiracy  to  do  an  act
    facilitating the commission of a breach of United  Kingdom  immigration
    law by individuals who are not  citizens  of  the  European  community,
    contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977.

10. As set out in the indictment reproduced a  page  151  of  IO  Lintern's
    witness statement, Ashraf Pervez and other named accused  were  charged
    with conspiring with others unknown,  between  1  August  2012  and  22
    October 2014, to form companies on  behalf  of  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    applicants  for  which  the  bank  accounts  would  become  temporarily
    credited with  sufficient  funds  to  enable  them,  whilst  acting  as
    directors thereof, to claim the  requisite  number  of  points  in  the
    course of submitting applications under the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Rules
    to the Home Office, which facilitated the commission  of  a  breach  of
    immigration law, namely the obtaining of leave by applicants to  remain
    in the UK by deception, namely by  submitting  application  forms  that
    contained false details concerning their investment of  a  sum  of  not
    less than �25,000 if acting as a Team  Member,  or  �50,000  if  acting
    alone  in  their  business,  knowing  that  the  acts  facilitated  the
    commission of a breach of immigration law by those individuals.

11. Having set out the digest of the transactions identified by IO  Lintern
    (but not  cross-referencing  them  to  the  evidence),  the  Department
    stated, at the top of page 4 of the refusal letter, that  it  would  be
    undesirable to permit the claimant to remain in the UK "in the light of
    your character and associations in respect of your  financial  dealings
    with ABC Bookkeeping and Accounting Ltd, the details of which have been
    clearly set out within this refusal letter."

12. Reliance was also placed on the fact that  (a)  the  last  returns  for
    Ourtel Ltd were listed as being made on 29 April 2016, and that  Ourtel
    Ltd was listed as having been dissolved since September 2017;  and  (b)
    that Ourtel Ltd was clearly set  up  to  facilitate  the  provision  of
    fraudulent evidence for other individuals to obtain leave to remain  as
    a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) migrants

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, The First-tier Tribunal

13. Both parties  were  legally  represented  before  Judge  Shamash.   The
    claimant's solicitors compiled an extensive bundle of documents running
    to 250  pages.   The  material  provided  included  a  16-page  witness
    statement from  the  appellant  in  which  he  addressed  each  of  the
    transactions identified in the refusal decision, and sought to give  an
    innocent explanation for them.  It  also  contained,  at  page  159,  a
    certificate issued by the Crown Court at Snaresbrook on 28  April  2017
    certifying that Pervez Ashraf had been acquitted.  He  had  been  found
    not guilty by the direction of the Trial Judge.

14. At the outset of the hearing, the  Judge  raised  with  the  Presenting
    Officer, Ms Ferrar, her concern that the refusal  letter  of  14  March
    2018 did not address the fact that the defendants were found not guilty
    following criminal proceedings in 2017.  Ms Ferrar accepted  that  this
    was unsatisfactory, but submitted that there was a  difference  between
    the civil standard of proof and the criminal standard  of  proof.   The
    Judge  invited  her  to  telephone  a  Senior  Caseworker.   Ms  Ferrar
    attempted to do so, but then applied for an adjournment  on  the  basis
    that she could not get hold of the decision-maker.  Mr Siddiq  for  the
    claimant opposed the application for an adjournment.  He submitted that
    no purpose would be served by an adjournment.

15. The Judge refused the adjournment request, and  also  indicated  to  Ms
    Ferrar that she did not think that she could cross-examine on the basis
    of an unsigned witness statement from IO Lintern that had been prepared
    for a trial where there had been an acquittal.

16. At paragraph [24] of the subsequent decision,  Judge  Shamash  recorded
    that Ms Ferrar chose not to ask questions of the claimant, who  adopted
    his witness statement in the bundle as his evidence in chief.

17. In her closing submissions on  behalf  of  the  Department,  Ms  Ferrar
    solely relied on the contents of the refusal letter, and  reminded  the
    Judge that the burden of proof in civil proceedings  was  different  to
    that in criminal proceedings.

18. The Judge's findings of fact were as follows:

         "32.  On the evidence before  me,  the  respondent  has  failed  to
         discharge the burden of establishing that the appellant was part of
         a scheme designed  to  obtain  Tier  1  visas  by  deception.   The
         respondent may be correct  in  her  points  and  I  note  that  the
         appellant claimed at his hearing before IJ Lal  that  his  business
         was still operational at a time when it  had  been  dissolved,  but
         this is not relied on by the respondent.   Instead  the  respondent
         relies on a criminal investigation which has resulted in acquittals
         without addressing the fact that  the  defendants  were  acquitted.
         This is unacceptable.

         33.  In addition, I cannot rely on an unsigned  statement  prepared
         for criminal proceedings.  As this  was  the  sole  basis  for  the
         points contained in the refusal  letter  and  Mr  Lintern  did  not
         attend Court, there is absolutely no evidence before  me  that  the
         appellant was involved in a conspiracy to obtain Tier  1  visas  by
         deception.

         34.  The sole ground of appeal is under the Human  Rights  Act.   I
         find that as the basis for the respondent's decision is flawed  and
         not based on evidence, it breaches the appellant's human rights and
         is not proportionate."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

19. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Kandola drew my attention to the fact that the evidence  relied
    on by the Department was not confined to the witness  statement  of  Mr
    Lintern.  The Home Office bundle also  included  a  number  of  primary
    documents evidencing some of the transactions detailed in  the  refusal
    decision.  He submitted that the matters set out at pages 3  and  4  of
    the refusal decision made out a prima facie case of deception, and  the
    Judge had not adequately engaged with this case.

20. Mr Biggs developed the  Rule  24  response  filed  by  his  Instructing
    Solicitors opposing the appeal.  He  submitted  that  there  were  five
    reasons as to why I should find that there was no error, or no material
    error.  Firstly, there  was  no  meaningful  or  adequate  evidence  to
    support the Department's case of deception.  Secondly,  the  Department
    failed  to  present  evidence  addressing  the  significance   of   the
    acquittals.  Thirdly, the Department's case failed to take into account
    the earlier favourable decision in respect of the claimant, which  fell
    to be applied on Devaseelan grounds.  Fourthly, the  claimant  was  not
    cross-examined on his innocent explanation for  the  allegedly  suspect
    transactions.  Fifthly, the Department had not in any event put forward
    a coherent case in the refusal decision  as  to  why  the  transactions
    relied upon showed that the claimant had used deception.

21. In reply, Mr Kandola observed that arguably there had  been  unfairness
    in the conduct of the hearing, but  unfortunately  this  had  not  been
    pleaded as a ground of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

Discussion

22. I consider that the most controversial aspect of the Judge's conduct of
    the hearing was her encouraging the Presenting Officer not to  ask  any
    questions on the material derived from the unsigned  witness  statement
    of  IO  Lintern.   The  Rules  of  Evidence  do  not  apply   in   this
    jurisdiction. Furthermore,  even  in  the  civil  jurisdiction  hearsay
    evidence is admissible.  It was not necessary that  IO  Lintern  should
    attend at the  hearing  to  adopt  his  statement  in  order  for  that
    statement to form part of the evidence that the  Tribunal  should  take
    into account.  Moreover, in taking the stance that she did,  the  Judge
    overlooked the fact that the line taken by the claimant in his  witness
    statement was not generally one of denying that  the  transactions  had
    taken place, but of "confession and avoidance."  In short, the claimant
    maintained that  the  transactions  were  above-board  and/or  did  not
    evidence deception.

23. However, as Mr  Kandola  acknowledges,  the  Department  did  not  seek
    permission  to  appeal  on  the  ground  that  there   was   procedural
    irregularity or  procedural  unfairness.   Specifically,  there  is  no
    appeal against the decision of the Judge to discourage  the  Presenting
    Officer from cross-examining the claimant on IO Lintern's evidence.  It
    is also doubtful that the  Presenting  Officer  would  have  asked  the
    claimant questions, even without the Judge discouraging her from  doing
    so.  For Mr Kandola reported to me that, according to her  minute,  the
    Presenting Officer was concerned that that she did not have enough time
    to ask questions as it was approaching 5pm.

24. The fact that the claimant gave unchallenged  evidence  to  the  effect
    that the transactions relied upon in the refusal decision  were  above-
    board, and did not disclose any impropriety or deception on  his  part,
    is fatal to the Department's appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.   For,  in
    these  circumstances,  it  cannot  reasonably  be  contended  that  any
    asserted deficiency in  the  Judge's  reasoning  was  material  to  the
    outcome.

25. Moreover, for the avoidance of doubt, I consider that  the  Judge  gave
    adequate reasons for finding that the Department had not discharged the
    burden of proving that Rule  322(5)  was  made  out,  in  circumstances
    where:

          a) The case advanced in the refusal decision was  opaque  and  it
             did not disclose a clear  or  coherent  prima  facie  case  of
             deception;

          b) The same material referred to in the  decision  had  not  been
             deemed fit to be left to a Jury - the Trial  Judge  must  have
             been satisfied that no reasonable Jury could return a  verdict
             of guilty on this material (and the rest of the material in IO
             Lintern's  witness  statement),  and  so  the  Jury  had  been
             directed to acquit the defendants;

          c) The Department had previously  accepted  the  finding  of  the
             Tribunal that the claimant had operated a genuine  and  viable
             business through Ourtel Ltd;

          d) It was not now being alleged, on the  basis  of  new  evidence
             from the criminal trial, that in retrospect Ourtel Ltd  was  a
             sham, or that in retrospect the claimant had not genuinely set
             up and operated a viable business through Ourtel Ltd;

          e) It was not  being  alleged  that  the  money  required  to  be
             invested in the Company  had  only  stayed  in  the  Company's
             account for a few days in order to support a fraudulent Tier 1
             application, and that the money had then been moved by ABC  to
             another company to  support  another  fraudulent  application,
             although this was said  to  be  the  central  feature  of  the
             alleged conspiracy  in  the  criminal  prosecution  of  Ashraf
             Pervez.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
