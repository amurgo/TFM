Representation:
For the Appellant:     no appearance and no representative
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant, a national of Pakistan, appealed to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State  to  refuse
         his application for leave to remain as a Tier 4  (General)  Student
         Migrant and to remove him from the UK.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Fox dismissed  the  appeal  and  the  appellant  now  appeals  with
         permission to this Tribunal.

      2. There was no appearance by or on behalf of  the  appellant  at  the
         hearing before me. I was satisfied  that  the  appellant  had  been
         notified of the hearing and that no reasons had been given for  his
         absence. As I considered that there was sufficient  information  on
         the file to determine the appeal so I decided that it  was  in  the
         interests of justice to proceed with the hearing in the absence  of
         the appellant in accordance with Rule 38 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Immigration Rules 2008.

    Error of Law

      3. The background to this appeal  is  that  on  22  October  2011  the
         appellant was granted leave to enter the UK as a  student  until  2
         March 2012. On 1 March 2012 he applied for leave  to  remain  as  a
         Tier 4 Student. The respondent refused the application on  13  July
         2012. The appellant sought an oral hearing of  the  appeal  in  the
         First-tier Tribunal and a hearing was listed for 17 September 2014.
         However the appellant did not attend the hearing and the First-tier
         Tribunal Judge was satisfied that the appellant had  been  notified
         of the hearing and he went on to determine the appeal on the papers
         and dismiss the appeal.

      4. However the grounds of appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  contend  that
         the appellants solicitors notified the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  9
         September 2014  that  the  appellant  wished  to  have  his  appeal
         determined on the papers and submitted a  bundle  of  evidence  for
         consideration. The representatives submitted a copy of  the  letter
         and bundle and  recorded  delivery  slip.  On  the  basis  of  this
         evidence I accept that the letter and  documents  were  sent  on  9
         September 2014 and delivered to the hearing centre on 10  September
         2014. I accept that  it  is  clear  from  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge's determination that the letter and bundle were not linked to
         the file and that he did not  therefore  consider  them.  In  these
         circumstances I find that, although the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         was unaware of it, there was a procedural error which  was  capable
         of making a material difference to the outcome or the  fairness  of
         the proceedings. For this reason  I  set  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge's decision aside and I remake the decision on  the  basis  of
         the evidence before me.

    Remaking the decision

      5. According to the Reasons for Refusal letter the appellant  was  not
         awarded the required 10 points  for  maintenance  (funds)  for  two
         reasons. The first was that he had not shown that the  third  party
         sponsor (Muhammad Zameer) is his father as claimed by  providing  a
         birth certificate as set out in the guidance. Secondly he  had  not
         shown that he had �6400 for a consecutive period of 28 days  before
         the application which was required to meet  the  Tier  4  (General)
         Student maintenance requirements. The appellant must show  that  he
         had �6400 for 28 days before he made the  application  on  1  March
         2012.

      6. Mr Nath submitted that the appellant had still not established that
         he  met  the  requirements.  In  particular  the  bank   statements
         submitted are in Pakistani Rupees and there is no  evidence  as  to
         what the funds equate to in sterling. Further,  he  submitted  that
         the appellant has still not provided evidence to establish that the
         sponsor is his father as claimed.

      7. In his witness statement the appellant says that the bank statement
         shows Rs 9,237,535.00  which  is  equal  to  approximately  �54000.
         However the bank statement provided, which  is  the  same  as  that
         submitted to the respondent with the application,  shows  that  the
         closing balance on 28 February 2012 was  in  fact  Rs  4,180,191.00
         which, according to the Oanda currency converter as of today's date
         is equivalent to �27,350.60. The appellant is therefore unclear  as
         to how much money his father has in his account.

      8. Further, as pointed out in the Reasons for Refusal letter, the bank
         account provided shows that the funds in the account dropped to  Rs
         489,291 on 17 February 2012 which is equivalent to �3,201.39  today
         according to the Oanda currency  converter.  This  means  that  the
         appellant cannot show that he was in  possession  of  the  required
         �6400 for a consecutive period  of  28  days  before  the  date  of
         application.

      9.  In  any  event  the  only  evidence  submitted  to  establish  the
         relationship is the same as that submitted to the  respondent  with
         the application. It is an affidavit from Muhammad Zameer  dated  29
         February 2012 stating that  the  appellant  is  his  son.  This  is
         insufficient to establish that the appellant is  in  fact  Muhammad
         Zameer's son as required.

     10. The appellant has not therefore  demonstrated  that  he  meets  the
         requirements of the Immigration Rules.

     11. In his witness statement the appellant said that he has established
         a private life in the UK and he relied on the decision in CDS (PBS:
         "available": Article 8) Brazil [2010] UKUT 305 (IAC). The appellant
         cannot meet the requirements for the  establishment  of  a  private
         life set out in paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.

     12. The Supreme Court considered the issue of Article 8 and students in
         the case of Patel and Others v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2013] UKSC 72 where Lord Carnwath said;

             "57.      It is important to remember that Article 8 is not  a
             general dispensing power. It is to be distinguished  from  the
             Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
             outside the rules, which may be  unrelated  to  any  protected
             human right. The merits of a decision not to depart  from  the
             rules are not reviewable on appeal:  section  86(6).  One  may
             sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for 'common sense'
             in the application of the rules to  graduates  who  have  been
             studying  in  the  UK  for  some  years  ...   However,   such
             considerations do not by themselves provide grounds of  appeal
             under Article 8, which is concerned  with  private  or  family
             life, not education as such. The opportunity for  a  promising
             student to  complete  his  course  in  this  country,  however
             desirable in general terms, is not in itself a right protected
             under Article 8."

     13. That case was considered by the Upper Tribunal in Nasim and  others
         (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC). The Tribunal said;

              "20.     We therefore agree with Mr Jarvis that [57] of Patel
             and Others is a significant exhortation from the Supreme Court
             to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of  Article  8
             and, in particular, to recognise its  limited  utility  to  an
             individual where one has moved along the continuum, from  that
             Article's  core  area  of  operation  towards  what  might  be
             described as its fuzzy penumbra. The limitation  arises,  both
             from what will at that point normally be the tangential effect
             on the individual of the proposed interference  and  from  the
             fact that, unless there are particular reasons to  reduce  the
             public  interest  of  enforcing  immigration  controls,   that
             interest   will   consequently   prevail   in   striking   the
             proportionality balance (even assuming that stage is reached).

             21. In conclusion on this first general matter, we  find  that
             the nature of the right asserted by each  of  the  appellants,
             based on their desire, as  former  students,  to  undertake  a
             period of post-study work in the United Kingdom, lies  at  the
             outer reaches of cases requiring an affirmative answer to  the
             second of the five "Razgar" questions and that, even  if  such
             an  affirmative  answer  needs  to  be  given,  the  issue  of
             proportionality is to be resolved decisively in favour of  the
             respondent, by reference to her functions as the  guardian  of
             the system  of  immigration  controls,  entrusted  to  her  by
             Parliament."

     14. In this case the appellant has done no more than assert that he has
         a private life such as entitles him to be granted leave  to  remain
         to continue  with  his  studies.  The  appellant  has  provided  no
         evidence  as  to  the  nature  and  extent  of  any  private   life
         established in the UK. I note that he has been  here  for  a  short
         period; most of the time has been whilst he has been pursuing  this
         appeal. In the absence of any evidence as to his  private  life  or
         how his removal would interfere with any private life I  find  that
         the decision to remove the appellant would not interfere  with  his
         private life.

Conclusion:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error on point of law.

I set the decision aside and remake it by dismissing the  appeal  under  the
Immigration Rules and under Article 8 of the ECHR.
