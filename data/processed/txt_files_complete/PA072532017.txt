                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. Following a hearing at Manchester  on  27  March  2018,  the  Upper
        Tribunal set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  which
        dismissed the appellant's appeal on  protection  and  human  rights
        grounds. The matter comes before the Upper Tribunal today  for  the
        purposes of it substituting a decision to either allow  or  dismiss
        the appeal.



Background


     2. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq born on 14 July 1982 of  Kurdish
        ethnicity. An application for international protection was  refused
        by the respondent on 19 July 2017.
     3. The core the appellant's account is that  he  originates  from  the
        village of Arabok in Mosul province. He worked as  a  shepherd  and
        prior to leaving Iraq lived with his mother and sister. In  2013  a
        Shia militia group came to the village requesting young  people  in
        the village spy on the Iraqi army and pass  information  gained  to
        them. The Iraqi army also visited the village regularly  and  asked
        for information on the militia and ISIS. The appellant claims on 14
        August 2014 his village was destroyed by ISIS as a  consequence  of
        which he was forced to travel to another location, about  one  hour
        from his village by car, where  he  stayed  for  28  months  before
        leaving Iraq on 1 December 2016, arriving in the United Kingdom and
        claiming asylum on 30 January 2017.




Discussion



     4. Following  consideration  of  the  appellant's  bundle  no  factual
        dispute was indicated to the Upper Tribunal by Mr McVeety.  It  was
        accepted that the issue was the  availability  of  the  appellant's
        CSID and the possibility of his being able  to  obtain  one  either
        before or on return to Iraq. It was accepted by Mr McVeety that  if
        the appellant could not obtain such  a  document  his  appeal  must
        succeed in light of the current country guidance case law.
     5. The issue is that of internal relocation to the IKR in relation  to
        which possession of a CSID and/or the feasibility of obtaining  one
        is a key issue.
     6. The two main country guidance cases are AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq  CG
        [2015] UKUT 544 (IAC) (unchanged by the Court of Appeal)  in  which
        it was held that (i)  the Respondent  will  only  return  an  Iraqi
        national (P) to the IKR if  P  originates  from  the  IKR  and  P's
        identity has been  "pre-cleared"  with  the  IKR  authorities.  The
        authorities in the IKR do not require  P  to  have  an  expired  or
        current passport, or laissez passer;  (ii)  the  IKR  is  virtually
        violence free. There is  no  Article  15(c)  risk  to  an  ordinary
        civilian in the IKR; (iii) A Kurd (K) who does not  originate  from
        the IKR can obtain entry for 10 days as a visitor  and  then  renew
        this entry permission for a further 10 days. If K finds employment,
        K can remain for longer, although K will need to register with  the
        authorities and provide  details  of  the  employer.  There  is  no
        evidence that the IKR authorities pro-actively  remove  Kurds  from
        the IKR whose permits have come to  an  end;  (iv)  whether  K,  if
        returned to Baghdad,  can  reasonably  be  expected  to  avoid  any
        potential undue harshness in that city by travelling  to  the  IKR,
        will be fact sensitive; and is likely to involve an  assessment  of
        (a)the practicality of travel from Baghdad to the IKR (such  as  to
        Irbil by air - there is not a real risk  of  an  ordinary  civilian
        travelling from  Baghdad  airport  to  the  southern  governorates,
        suffering serious harm en route to such governorates so  as  engage
        Article 15(c).); (b)the likelihood of K's  securing  employment  in
        the IKR; and (c) the availability of  assistance  from  family  and
        friends in the IKR; (v) As a general matter, a non-Kurd who  is  at
        real risk in a home area in Iraq is unlikely to be able to relocate
        to the IKR, and AAH (Iraqi Kurds -  internal  relocation)  Iraq  CG
        [2018] UKUT 212 in which it was found there was  general  agreement
        that for Arab Iraqis there  was  in  general  terms  no  reasonable
        internal relocation to the IKR.   All  returns  to  Iraq  were  via
        Baghdad but for a returnee of Kurdish origin  in  possession  of  a
        valid passport or CSID the journey  whether  by  land  or  air  was
        affordable and practical and can be made without real risk  neither
        are there unduly harsh difficulties  on  the  journey.   Without  a
        passport or CSID a flight  could  not  be  boarded;  as  there  are
        checkpoints if the journey is made by road there is a real risk  of
        the returnee being detained at a checkpoint if he cannot verify his
        identity.  The verification would normally require attendance of  a
        male family member  with  the  returnee's  identity  documents  but
        connections higher up the chain of command  could  also  be  called
        upon.  It would not be reasonable to require the returnee to travel
        unless he could verify  his  identity.   There  is  no  sponsorship
        requirement for Kurds, so they would normally be permitted to enter
        after security screening and registering their  presence  with  the
        mukhtar.  Whether a returnee  was  at  risk  during  the  screening
        process was fact sensitive but coming from a family associated with
        ISIS, from ISIS territory and being a single male of  fighting  age
        may increase the risk, but the returnee is likely  to  be  able  to
        show that he arrived from the UK and therefore not immediately from
        ISIS territory.  Family members living in the IKR would in  general
        be required by cultural norms to accommodate him so that  he  would
        in general have sufficient assistance from the family not to render
        his life unduly harsh, but this would have to be  determined  on  a
        case by case basis.  Without the assistance of family accommodation
        options are limited - it costs $300 - $400 to rent an apartment  in
        a modern block; whilst critical shelter arrangements are  available
        (living in an unfinished structure, a school, a mosque, a tent etc)
        it would be unduly harsh for a returnee to live there without basic
        necessities such as food clean water  and  clothing.   To  consider
        whether basic necessities could be accessed account must  be  taken
        of the fact  the  returnee  could  apply  for  a  grant  under  the
        voluntary returns scheme giving access to ï¿½1500 - financial support
        from other sources such as work, remittances from relatives  abroad
        or accessing PDS rations should be considered.  So far as  securing
        employment  is  concerned,  lone  women  are  unlikely  to   secure
        employment, the unemployment rate for IDPs  is  70%,  the  returnee
        needs a  CSID  in  order  to  work,  unskilled  workers  are  at  a
        disadvantage, patronage  and  nepotism  are  important  in  gaining
        employment so that someone with contacts is in a  better  position,
        being in a  location  with  an  association  with  ISIS  can  deter
        prospective employers.
     7. It is not disputed on the respondent's behalf that without  a  CSID
        the appellant will  be  unable  to  access  housing,  benefits,  or
        employment. Mr McVeety submits that the appellant has had his  CSID
        with him all the time and therefore would have access to  the  same
        or will be a person who could obtain the same, but the  uncontested
        evidence in is bundle is that the appellant does not  have  such  a
        document.
     8. If the appellant was in possession of his CSID or a valid  passport
        he could travel to the IKR. Head note 3  of  AA  stating:  "for  an
        Iraqi national returnee (P) of Kurdish origin in the possession  of
        a valid CSID or Iraqi passport, the journey  from  Baghdad  to  the
        IKR, whether by air or land, is affordable and practical and can be
        made without a real risk of P suffering persecution, serious  harm,
        Article 3 ill-treatment nor with any difficulties  on  the  journey
        make relocation unduly harsh".
     9. It was accepted on the respondent's behalf that  if  the  appellant
        had a CSID and/or Iraqi passport he will be able to board a  flight
        to the IKR even after a short stay in Baghdad. It was not suggested
        this is a case in which the appellant could be reasonably  expected
        to relocate to Baghdad and to settle in that city.
    10. The country guidance confirms there is no need for sponsorship  for
        a person of Kurdish ethnicity to enter the IKR.   It  is  said  the
        appellant has family in Iraq, but this will only be his mother  and
        sister.
    11. It was submitted on the respondent's behalf that the appellant  has
        some resources and could access the employment market  although  it
        is also accepted that the unemployment rate in the IKR is high.
    12. There was no evidence the appellant is in  possession  of  a  valid
        CSID.  The  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge   records   the   appellant
        confirming he was issued with such a document which  he  stated  in
        his evidence he had left in his home area. The  appellant  will  be
        returned on a temporary travel document but will need to apply  for
        a CSID.
    13. It was argued by Mr Schwenk the respondent needed  to  indicate  on
        what document  the  appellant  will  be  returned  but  it  is  not
        suggested, for example, that the appellant will be returned using a
        valid passport. It is likely on the facts to be an emergency travel
        document.
    14. The appellant's home area was or still is a contested  area  making
        it difficult for the appellant to obtain  a  CSID  in  person.  The
        country guidance case confirms the appellant will be  able  to  get
        one through family, but a male relative is required  which  it  was
        submitted is problematic. At page 16  of  the  appellant's  witness
        statement, which is not challenged, the appellant states he has  no
        male relatives in Iraq.
    15. Whether the appellant is able to obtain his  CSID  or  successfully
        internally relocate depends upon his individual circumstances,  but
        in light of the fact that he does not possess a valid  passport  or
        identity card on which he could be returned, with  no  male  family
        members in Iraq, it has to be found the  appellant  has  discharged
        the burden of proof to the lower standard to establish he would not
        be able to obtain a CSID at this time, or a valid passport, without
        which he could not board a plane to the IKR; forcing him to have to
        remain  in  Baghdad  which  has  been  accepted  will   result   in
        circumstances that are unduly harsh in light of  his  circumstances
        and the country guidance position.
    16. There also appears to be no evidence  of  family  able  to  provide
        accommodation  or  care  for  the  appellant  on  return  and   the
        respondent accepts it is not appropriate to return a person  solely
        for them to enter one of the camps for Internally Displaced Persons
        in light of the overcrowding and problems experienced and  recorded
        in the country information. Even if the appellant is returned  with
        some  funds  it  has  not  been   established   he   could   obtain
        accommodation on a long-term  basis  as  he  will  need  to  obtain
        employment. The appellant is of limited skills with  no  connection
        to the IKR and will  struggle  to  obtain  meaningful  remunerative
        employment.
    17. I find on the basis of  the  specific  facts  of  this  appeal  the
        appellant has discharged the  burden  of  proof  upon  him  to  the
        required standard to show that in light of  his  circumstances  and
        the prevailing country guidance information he cannot  be  returned
        to Iraq. The consequence of not obtaining a CSID and/or  having  to
        remain in Baghdad is accepted by the respondent as entitling him to
        a right to remain in the United Kingdom.


Decision

    18. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is allowed.

   Anonymity.


    19. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


I make no  such  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
