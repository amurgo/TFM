Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Muquit, Counsel instructed by Farani Javid
Taylor Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who made a combined  application
    for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-
    based system and for a biometric residence permit on  13th  July  2013.
    His application was refused and a subsequent appeal dismissed by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Burns in a determination promulgated on 14th August
    2014.  As the judge put it in paragraph 20, "the most fundamental point
    was the failure to provide audited accounts".

 2. Grounds of application were lodged.  The  first  ground  was  that  the
    Appellant's evidence was that the accounts were due for March 2015, not
    2014, and that the judge had misrecorded  the  evidence.   Furthermore,
    for the judge to say that the Appellant had not asked his accountant to
    provide unaudited accounts for today's proceedings was an error as  the
    Appellant would not have been entitled to adduce such  evidence  before
    the Tribunal by virtue of Section 85A of the NIAA 2002.

 3. The second ground was that there had been an erroneous construction  of
    Rule 46-AD in that accounts must only be required  to  be  produced  if
    they reasonably can be said to exist.  It was said that the judge erred
    in reading the provisions as requiring otherwise.  The third and  final
    ground was that the judge failed to take into account evidence  of  the
    invested funds which were not reproduced within the Respondent's bundle
    but were a letter from his accountant and a balance sheet as  mentioned
    in the refusal letter.  The Respondent was therefore  well  aware  that
    the  funds  had  been  invested  and  should  have  waived  the  formal
    requirements for audited accounts.  What the judge should have done was
    to make a finding on  whether  the  substance  of  that  provision  was
    satisfied, namely that the company was in fact  trading  and  that  the
    investment had been made or alternatively there were minor issues which
    clearly fell under the terms of  paragraph 245AA of the Rules.

 4. A Rule 24 notice was lodged saying it was possible to produce  accounts
    for a period of less than one year and it was  unlikely  the  Appellant
    would have claimed to be awaiting accounts that were not to be produced
    until March  2015.   It  was  in  the  interest  of  all  parties  that
    consistent immigration control was  maintained  and,  in  general,  the
    grounds were a disagreement with findings that were open to  the  judge
    on the evidence presented to him.

 5. Before me Mr Muquit appeared  for  the  Appellant  and  relied  on  his
    skeleton argument.  The judge had noted  the  date  incorrectly  saying
    that the accounts were due to be filed on 12th March  2014  (i.e.  nine
    months after the application).  This was not a lawful basis to consider
    that the Appellant had not complied with the requirements of the  Rules
    as to specified evidence.  The reason was because the audited  accounts
    required to be submitted in accordance with  paragraph  46-SD(a)(i)  of
    Appendix A are the very same audited accounts that are required  to  be
    produced in accordance with obligations to do so  as  a  company  under
    company law.  There was no requirement to  produce  any  other  audited
    accounts as part of the  entrepreneurial  visa  application.   In  this
    context it was to be noted that 46-SD(a)(i)  refers  to  "the"  audited
    accounts that a company is obliged to produce that  must  be  submitted
    not "any" or "a set of" audited accounts as suggested in  the  Rule  24
    notice.

 6. As the judge himself had accepted, it would  have  been  unsatisfactory
    for the Respondent not to exercise discretion to cure what  were  minor
    deficiencies in the contracts submitted.

 7. In terms of Ground 3, it was to  be  noted  that  the  application  did
    produce his business bank statements showing deposits by the  Appellant
    to the tune of ï¿½54,200 as well as transactions reflecting the  purchase
    of goods/services necessary to establish the business.

 8. In all the circumstances I was asked to set aside the judge's  decision
    and allow the appeal outright.

 9. Mr Whitwell relied on this Rule 24 notice.  He submitted that if  there
    was an error in law the matter should be reconsidered by the  Secretary
    of State.

Conclusions

10. I am satisfied that the judge erred in law and that it is necessary  to
    set the decision aside.  As said  above,  the  reason  the  appeal  was
    dismissed was because of the failure to provide audited  accounts.   In
    the circumstances where the company had only just begun trading it  was
    not feasible to expect audited accounts to be produced when  they  were
    not required under company law to be lodged until March 2015.   It  was
    therefore unsound and an error of law  by  the  judge  to  dismiss  the
    appeal on this basis and it is therefore necessary to set the  decision
    aside and make a fresh decision.

11. While Mr Muquit's skeleton  argument  urges  me  to  allow  the  appeal
    outright that seems to me to be premature given what is said in  Ground
    3 of  the  application,  namely  that  there  were  a  number  of  very
    significant documents lodged which the judge failed to  deal  with  and
    which  the  Secretary  of  State  needs  an  opportunity  to  consider,
    particularly given that the Appellant is not in a position  to  provide
    the audited accounts.  I therefore agree  with  Mr  Whitwell  that  the
    appropriate conclusion, given the finding that there  is  an  error  of
    law, is for the  Secretary  of  State  to  reconsider  the  Appellant's
    application.

Decision

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

13. I set aside the decision.

14. I re-make the decision in the appeal  by  requiring  the  Secretary  of
    State to reconsider the application.
