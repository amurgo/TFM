                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr G P McGowan, of Quinn Martin & Langan, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge S
    Gillespie, promulgated on  20  February  2017,  dismissing  his  appeal
    against refusal of asylum.

 2. The grounds include failure to make a finding on whether the  appellant
    is a genuine Christian convert.

 3. Mr Matthews conceded that the judge made no finding on the  issue,  and
    that the omission was an error of law.

 4. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

 5. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 6. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge S Gillespie.

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
