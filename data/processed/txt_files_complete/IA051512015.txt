                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, [NT], was born on [ ] 1983 and is a  female  citizen  of
    Cameroon.  She appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Kempton)
    against the decision of the Secretary of State dated  22  January  2015
    refusing her further leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis
    of  her  private  life/compassionate  circumstances.   The   First-tier
    Tribunal, in a decision promulgated on 5 October  2015,  dismissed  the
    appeal.  The appellant now  appeals,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. At the outset of the appeal, Mr Seymour, for  the  appellant,  told  me
    that the appeal proceeded on Article 8 ECHR grounds only; the appellant
    accepts that she cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The first ground asserts that the judge failed to make factual findings
    or to assess the  evidence  properly.   The  grounds  record  that  the
    appellant works in the National Health Service as an  administrator  in
    the United Kingdom and has some family members living in  this  country
    and takes hepatitis treatment which may not be available  in  Cameroon.
    The grounds complain that there does not appear "to be a clear  finding
    of adverse credibility (sic) against her, simply an  adverse  inference
    drawn from the absence of corroborating witnesses."

 4. At [16], the judge does indeed complain of being asked "to  accept  the
    appellant's account totally on face value without any other  evidence."
    The judge notes that the appellant claims  to  have  an  adult  brother
    living in the United Kingdom and that she has friends here.  The  judge
    went on to record that "in particular, there is no evidence  whatsoever
    about her marriage which did not take place.  There was no  independent
    evidence of her having been stood up on the big day  (sic).   There  is
    nothing from anybody about the matter."   The  judge  goes  on  in  the
    decision to accept [21] that the appellant "undoubtedly has  a  private
    life in the UK."

 5. I do not consider the judge's analysis to be flawed by any  failure  to
    make particular findings of  fact.   The  judge  had  to  consider  the
    appellant's private life in the United Kingdom  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence provided and, whilst I accept that he has not made a  positive
    "adverse  credibility"  finding  against  the  appellant  (to  use  the
    language employed by the judge), equally the judge has  not  found  the
    appellant's account of her current circumstances in the United  Kingdom
    to be incredible.  I consider the judge has taken  at  face  value  the
    appellant's own evidence with further and corroborating evidence  which
    might, for example, have indicated just how strong  or  compelling  the
    appellant's relationship is with her brother or with her  friends  were
    simply absent.  It was quite proper for the judge to note  the  absence
    of that evidence and to go ahead and assess the Article 8  ECHR  appeal
    simply on the bare facts as given by the appellant.  Put  bluntly,  the
    appellant seems to have had little to  place  in  the  balance  in  the
    exercise vis-ï¿½-vis the public interest concerned with her removal other
    than her assertion that she had a brother and friends in  the  country.
    It was for the appellant to adduce evidence with a view to  discharging
    the burden of proof and the  judge  did  not  err  in  law  by  drawing
    attention to the fact that she had adduced very little evidence.

 6. The second ground of appeal asserts that the judge has  considered  the
    incorrect version of paragraph 276ADE.  At [9], whilst discussing  that
    paragraph, the judge  refers  to  the  need  to  consider  whether  the
    appellant  has  no  ties  (including  social,  cultural  family)   with
    Cameroon.  The correct version of the Rules (changed in July 2014)  now
    refers to "significant obstacles to the  appellant's  integration  into
    the country to which she would have to go if required to leave the UK."
     It is asserted by that by referring to the wrong version of the Rules,
    the judge has erred in law.

 7. I find the ground has no merit.  It may well be the case that the judge
    has referred to the wrong version of the  Rules  but,  given  that  the
    appellant could not satisfy the Rules at all and that  the  appeal  was
    based on Article 8 ECHR grounds only, it is difficult to see  how  this
    may be material.  I acknowledge that it may in certain circumstances be
    necessary to consider the Article 8  appeal  through  the  lens  of  an
    appellant's ability or inability  to  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules.
    However, the fact remains that the appellant had been unable to produce
    any evidence to the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  she  had  no  ties  to
    Cameroon or that  there  exist  significant  obstacles  preventing  her
    integration into that country where she has lived the majority  of  her
    life.  It is difficult to see how either  provision  may  have  had  an
    impact on the Article 8 analysis.

 8. The third ground of appeal asserts that the judge failed to  apply  the
    proper standard of proof.  The judge referred at [4] to the standard of
    proof being "a balance of probabilities."  Later [5] the judge referred
    to  the  need  to  identify  "substantial  grounds  for  believing  the
    evidence."  Later, at [18], the judge stated that there  was  "no  huge
    likelihood (sic) of [the appellant] going on in the  future  to  suffer
    liver scarring as this affects only 20% of carriers and she has an  80%
    chance of being one of those who do not go on to suffer cirrhosis."

 9. The use of language by the judge is  unfortunate.   However,  the  fact
    remains that the judge has correctly indicated the standard of proof in
    the Article 8 appeal (the balance of probabilities) and my  reading  of
    the other passages which I have quoted above indicates that  these  are
    simply forms of expression employed by the judge; they do  not,  in  my
    opinion, indicate that she has departed  from  an  application  of  the
    correct standard of proof.  For example, the use  of  the  words  "huge
    likelihood" is simply a means of expressing  the  differential  between
    80% and 20%.  The language used by the judge is  infelicitous  but  its
    effect upon the overall reasoning  of  the  decision  is  not  such  as
    materially to undermine or damage it.

10. The fourth ground of appeal complains that  the  judge  had  not  fully
    taken into account Section 117 of the 2002 Act (as amended).  The judge
    refers to Section 117 at [21] noting that "the appellant only ever came
    to the UK on a temporary basis."  Other factors such as the appellant's
    ability to speak English and her ability to support herself financially
    had not been considered.

11. I find that the ground does not have merit.  The judge has stated  that
    she has taken into account Section 117 and I have no reason to  believe
    that the judge did not do so.  The fact that the judge refers  to  only
    one  element  of  the  application  of  Section  117  (the  appellant's
    temporary status in the United Kingdom) does not mean  that  the  judge
    has ignored the other relevant parts of the statute.   The  failure  to
    refer to the other provisions in terms is not an error of law.  Indeed,
    Mr Seymour did not seek to persuade me that the appellant's ability  to
    speak English or support herself financially (a matter regarding  which
    there had been no findings of fact and exists very little evidence) are
    unlikely to make a material difference to the outcome of the Article  8
    appeal.

12. For the reasons I  have  given,  I  find  that  the  appeal  should  be
    dismissed.
