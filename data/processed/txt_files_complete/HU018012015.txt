                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                               VARINDER KUMARI
                       (Anonymity direction not made)
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Ms S Hussain of RH & Co, solicitors.


DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as  they  were  in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Blair,  promulgated  on  22  November
2016 which allowed the Appellant's appeal.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 5 June 1969 and is a national of India.  On  16
May 2015 the Secretary of State  refused  the  Appellant's  application  for
entry clearance as the partner of her  sponsor  under  appendix  FM  of  the
Immigration Rules.


The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Blair ("the  Judge")  allowed  the  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision. Grounds  of  appeal  were  lodged  and  on  26  April  2017  Judge
Hodgkinson gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

      The grounds do not challenge the Judge's finding that the relationship
      is genuine and subsisting. Rather, they argue that the Judge erred  in
      concluding that the appellant satisfied the requirements  of  appendix
      FM-SE and in concluding  that  the  appeal  should  be  allowed  under
      article 8, no compelling circumstances  having  been  identified.  The
      grounds disclose arguable errors of law and permission is  granted  in
      relation to both grounds pleaded.

The Hearing

5. (a) For the respondent, Mr Matthews  moved  the  grounds  of  appeal.  He
reminded me of the terms of paragraph 2c  of  appendix  FM-SE.  He  told  me
that, to succeed, the appellant must provide personal bank  statements  with
the application and that that evidence is wholly lacking in  this  case.  He
argued  that  without  that  evidence  the   appellant   cannot   meet   the
requirements of the immigration rules, so that the Judge's finding  at  [32]
of the decision (that the  appellant  meets  the  immigration  rules)  is  a
finding which has been made in error.

(b) Mr Matthews moved to the second ground of appeal. He told  me  that  the
Judge approached article 8 outside the rules but did not  identify  adequate
reasons for considering article 8 outside the rules. He  told  me  that  the
Judge's finding at [35] is inconsistent with the second sentence of [32]  of
the decision. In any event he told  me  that  [35]  is  only  a  superficial
consideration of article 8, so that an  inadequate  balancing  exercise  has
been carried out and no reason for straying outside  the  immigration  rules
has been established.

(c) Mr Matthews urged me to allow the appeal and set the decision aside

6 (a) For the appellant, Ms Hussain told  me  that  the  decision  does  not
contain errors, material or otherwise. She told me  that  between  [28]  and
[34] of the decision the Judge analyses article 8 both by reference  to  the
rules and outside the rules. Ms Hussain referred me to MM (Lebanon)  v  SSHD
[2017] UKSC 10 and told me that the appellant plainly demonstrated  that  he
met the financial requirements of the rules.

(b) Ms Hussain told me that the facts of this case  merited  examination  of
the article 8  ECHR  grounds  of  appeal  out-with  the  rules  because  the
appellant and sponsor have a 10-year-old child who  is  a  British  citizen.
She again relied on MM(Lebanon) and  told  me  that  the  interests  of  the
British citizen child cannot be adequately considered by  reference  to  the
immigration rules alone.

(c) Ms Hussain urged me to dismiss the appeal  and  allow  the  decision  to
stand.

Analysis

7. Paragraph 2 of appendix FM-SE says

      2. In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where paragraph
      9 applies), all of the following evidence must be provided:
           (a) Payslips covering:
              1. (i) a period of 6 months prior to the date of application
                 if the person has been employed by their current employer
                 for at least 6 months (and where paragraph 13(b) of this
                 Appendix does not apply); or
              2. (ii) any period of salaried employment in the period of 12
                 months prior to the date of application if the person has
                 been employed by their current employer for less than 6
                 months (or at least 6 months but the person does not rely
                 on paragraph 13(a) of this Appendix), or in the financial
                 year(s) relied upon by a self-employed person.
           (b) A letter from the employer(s) who issued the payslips at
           paragraph 2(a) confirming:
              3. (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;
              4. (ii) the length of their employment;
              5. (iii) the period over which they have been or were paid the
                 level of salary relied upon in the application; and
              6. (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract
                 or agency).
           (c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period(s)
           as the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the salary has
           been paid into an account in the name of the person or in the
           name of the person and their partner jointly.
8. In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112  (IAC)  it  was
held that in appeals against refusal of entry  clearance  under  Article  8,
the claimant's ability to satisfy the Immigration Rules is not the  question
to be determined by the Tribunal, but is capable of being a weighty,  though
not  determinative,  factor  when   deciding   whether   such   refusal   is
proportionate to the legitimate aim of  enforcing  immigration  control.  At
paragraph 9 it was said that where the ground of appeal is limited to  human
rights

       Clearly there can be no question of entertaining an appeal on grounds
      alleging that the decision was not in accordance with the law  or  the
      immigration rules. These  are  not  permissible  grounds.  However  if
      ...the claimant has shown that refusing him entry ...  does  interfere
      with his ...family life then  it  will  be  necessary  to  assess  the
      evidence to see if the claimant meets the substance of the rules. This
      is because...  the  ability  to  satisfy  the  rules  illuminates  the
      proportionality of the decision to refuse him entry clearance

9. In Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261  (IAC)  it  was  held
that (i) The first question to be addressed in an appeal against refusal  to
grant entry clearance as a visitor  where  only  human  rights  grounds  are
available is whether article 8 of the ECHR is engaged at all. If it is  not,
which will not infrequently be the case, the Tribunal  has  no  jurisdiction
to embark upon an assessment of the decision of the ECO under the rules  and
should not do so. If article 8 is engaged, the Tribunal may need to look  at
the extent to which the  claimant  is  said  to  have  failed  to  meet  the
requirements of  the  rule  because  that  may  inform  the  proportionality
balancing exercise that must follow. Mostafa (Article 8 in entry  clearance)
[2015] UKUT 112 (IAC) is not authority for any  contrary  proposition;  (ii)
As compliance with para 41 of HC 395  is  not  a  ground  of  appeal  to  be
decided by the Tribunal, any findings  concerning  that  will  carry  little
weight, especially if based upon arguments advanced only by  the  appellant.
If the appellant were to make a fresh application for  entry  clearance  the
ECO will, if requested to do so, have regard to the assessment  carried  out
by the judge but will not be bound by those findings to treat the  appellant
as a person who, at least at  the  date  of  the  appeal  hearing,  met  the
requirements of paragraph 41.

10. At [31] the Judge finds that the evidence presented to him  demonstrated
that the appellant earned �9490 in a six-month period prior to  application.
It is  clear  from  [27]  of  the  decision  that  the  Judge  reaches  that
conclusion by  placing  reliance  on  a  spreadsheet,  wage  slips,  P  60s,
accountant information and the sponsor's  evidence.  That  is  not  evidence
which the respondent would have accepted with an application because of  the
terms of appendix FM-SE.

11. The Judge was not considering appendix  FM-SE  because  the  ability  to
meet the immigration rules is not  a  free-standing,  competent,  ground  of
appeal. This is an appeal on article 8 ECHR  grounds  only.  The  Judge  has
(correctly) considered appendix FM and finds that on the evidence  presented
to him the requirements of appendix FM can be met. Because this  is  not  an
appeal under  the  immigration  rules,  the  Judge's  consideration  of  the
evidence is not restricted by the provisions of appendix FM-SE.

12. The Judge's finding in the first sentence of [32] of the decision  (that
the appellant meets the requirements of the  immigration  rules)  is  not  a
finding that the appellant meets the evidential requirements of appendix FM-
SE. It is an examination of the requirements of  appendix  FM  in  order  to
inform the overall article  8  assessments.  The  exercise  that  the  Judge
carries out is a consideration of the component parts of  article  8  family
life informed by appendix FM. The Judge is required to consider each  source
of evidence, and that is what he did, before reaching  his  conclusion  that
the appellant meets the financial threshold of an income of �18,600.

13. The Judge's finding that the appellant meets the financial threshold  is
entirely  consistent  with  a  finding  that   the   appellant   meets   the
requirements of appendix FM of the immigration rules. It is a finding  which
is well within the range of findings reasonably available to  the  Judge  to
make. At [32] the Judge goes on to record that meeting the  requirements  of
appendix FM does not automatically result in a  successful  article  8  ECHR
appeal.

14. The second ground of appeal  is  that  the  Judge  seamlessly  and  very
briefly considers article 8 outside the rules. His consideration of  article
8 is set out between [33] and [35]  of  the  decision.  It  is  argued  that
because the Judge does not make any assessment of what, if  any,  compelling
circumstances exist in this case that his article 8  assessment  is  flawed.
It is argued that without findings that compelling circumstances  exist  the
Judge cannot consider article 8 outside the rules.

15. In R (on the application of Esther Ebun Oludoyi & Ors) v SSHD(Article  8
- MM (Lebanon) and Nagre) IJR [2014] UKUT  00539  (IAC)  it  was  held  that
there is nothing in R (Nagre)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin),  Gulshan
(Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) Pakistan [2013]  UKUT  640  (IAC)
or Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT  00085  (IAC)  that  suggests
that a threshold test was being suggested as  opposed  to  making  it  clear
that there was a need to look at the evidence to see if there  was  anything
which has not already been adequately  considered  in  the  context  of  the
Immigration Rules and which could lead to  a  successful  Article  8  claim.
These authorities must not be read as  seeking  to  qualify  or  fetter  the
assessment of Article 8. This is  consistent  with  para  128  of  R  (MM  &
Others) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985, that there is no utility in  imposing  a
further intermediate test as a preliminary to a consideration of an  Article
8 claim beyond the relevant criterion-based Rule.

16    In Khan (2015) CSIH 29 the Inner House found in  favour  of  immigrant
spouses who challenged refusals to grant leave to remain.  The  Court  ruled
that there was no human rights rule that an  immigrant,  who  married  a  UK
national at a  time  when  their  immigration  status  was  uncertain,  must
establish "exceptional  circumstance"  before  removal  could  amount  to  a
breach of Article 8 of the ECHR.

17. In SS(Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387  Richards  LJ  Lord  Justice
Richards said at paragraph 33

      In our judgment, even though a test of exceptionality does  not  apply
      in every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it is  accurate
      to say that the general position outside the sorts of special contexts
      referred to above is that compelling circumstances would  need  to  be
      identified to support a claim for grant of LTR outside the  new  Rules
      in Appendix FM. In our view, that is a formulation  which  is  not  as
      strict  as  a  test  of  exceptionality  or  a  requirement  of  "very
      compelling reasons" (as referred to in MF (Nigeria) in the context  of
      the  Rules  applicable  to  foreign  criminals),   but   which   gives
      appropriate weight to the focused  consideration  of  public  interest
      factors as finds expression in the Secretary of State's formulation of
      the new Rules in Appendix FM. It  also  reflects  the  formulation  in
      Nagre at para. [29], which has been tested and has  survived  scrutiny
      in this court: see, e.g., Haleemudeen at [44], per Beatson LJ

18, In SS(Congo)  and  Others  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  Richards  LJ  drew  a
distinction in entry clearance cases, on the  one  hand,  involving  someone
outside the United Kingdom who applies to come here to  take  up  or  resume
family life when family life was  originally  established  in  ordinary  and
legitimate circumstances at some time  in  the  past,  rather  than  in  the
knowledge of its precariousness  in  terms  of  United  Kingdom  immigration
controls and cases, on the other, where  someone  from  the  United  Kingdom
marries a foreign national or establishes a  family  life  with  them  at  a
stage when they are contemplating trying to  live  together  in  the  United
Kingdom, but when they know that their partner does  not  have  a  right  to
come here. In the latter cases,  the  relationship  will  have  been  formed
under conditions of known precariousness  and  it  will  be  appropriate  to
apply a similar test of exceptional  circumstances  before  a  violation  of
Article 8 will be found to arise in relation  to  a  refusal  to  grant  LTE
outside the Rules.

19.  More recent cases indicate a departure from  the  requirement  to  find
some additional factor  before  article  8  can  be  confidently  considered
outside the rules. In Hesham Ali (Iraq)  v SSHD   [2016] UKSC 60  Lord  Reed
at paragraphs 47 to 50 endorsed the structured approach  to  proportionality
and said

      what has now become the established method of analysis  can  therefore
      continue to be followed in this context.....

That approach was  also  endorsed  in  MM  (Lebanon)  [2017]  UKSC  10   (in
particular paras 66 and 67) and in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11  where  Lord  Reed
in explaining how a court or tribunal should consider whether a  refusal  of
leave to remain was compatible with Article 8 made clear that  the  critical
issue was generally whether, giving  due  weight  to  the  strength  of  the
public interest in removal, the article 8 claim was sufficiently  strong  to
outweigh it.  There is no suggestion of any threshold to be overcome  before
proportionality can be fully considered.

20. Between [15] and [32] of the decision the Judge considers the article  8
ECHR grounds of appeal both within the rules and outwith the rules. At  [33]
the Judge clearly acknowledges that family life exists so  that  the  burden
of proving that the interference with family life  is  justified  shifts  to
the respondent. Between [33] and [35] the Judge adequately answers the  five
questions  posed  in  Razgar,  before  reaching  his  conclusion  that   the
respondent's decision  is  a  disproportionate  breach  of  the  appellant's
article 8 rights.

21. In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC)   the
Tribunal held that (i) Although there is  a  legal  duty  to  give  a  brief
explanation of the conclusions on the central issue on which  an  appeal  is
determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole
makes sense, having regard to the  material  accepted  by  the  judge;  (ii)
Although a decision may contain an error of law where  the  requirements  to
give adequate reasons are not met, the Upper  Tribunal  would  not  normally
set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  where  there  has  been  no
misdirection of law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised  and  the
relevant  Country  Guidance  has  been  taken  into  account,   unless   the
conclusions the judge draws from the primary data were not  reasonably  open
to him or her.

22.  The decision does not contain an error of law. It is for the  Judge  to
decide what weight to  place  on  the  evidence.  There  is  no  justifiable
criticism  of  the  fact-finding  exercise.  The  Judge   directed   himself
correctly in law. The Judge sets  out  adequate  reasons  for  reaching  the
conclusion that he reaches. The  decision  reached  by  the  Judge  is  well
within the range of reasonable conclusions available to the Judge.

23. In this case, there  is  no  misdirection  in  law  &  the  fact-finding
exercise is beyond criticism.  The decision is not  tainted  by  a  material
error of law. The Judge's decision, when read as a whole, sets out  findings
that are sustainable and sufficiently detailed.

CONCLUSION

24. No errors of law have been established. The Judge's decision stands.

DECISION

25. The appeal  is  dismissed.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
stands.
