Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Farrell, instructed by Lexmark Legal Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    appellant in  this  determination  identified  as  HT.  This  direction
    applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with
    this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings

      1. The appellant's  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  his  claim  for
         international protection and his human rights claim  was  dismissed
         for reasons set out in a  decision  by  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
         Hemborough promulgated on 3rd October 2018.

      2. Judge Hemborough found, inter alia, that the issue raised, for  the
         first time, at the hearing before  him  that  he  had  a  wife  and
         British citizen child, was a new matter  and,  in  accordance  with
         Mahmud (s85 - NIAA 2002 - new matters) Iran [2017] UKUT 00488  IAC)
         he had no jurisdiction  to  hear  evidence  unless  the  respondent
         agreed. The respondent did not agree; no request for an adjournment
         was made and the judge proceeded to hear the appeal  on  protection
         grounds and Article 8 on the basis of evidence other than  the  new
         relationship.

      3. The appellant sought and  was  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
         decision by the judge to  treat  the  new  relationship  as  a  new
         matter.

      4. Mr Bates provided Ms Farrell with a copy of AK  and  IK  (s85  NIAA
         2002 -new matters) Turkey [2019]  UKUT  00067  (IAC).  I  drew  her
         attention to OA and Others (human rights; 'new matter' s120) [2019]
         UKUT 65 and Quaidoo (new  matter:  procedure/process)  [2018]  UKUT
         00087(IAC). I indicated that the case law appeared  to  make  clear
         that the issue raised by the appellant at such a  very  late  stage
         was a new matter and that unless the presenting officer  agreed  to
         it being litigated, the First-tier Tribunal had no jurisdiction  to
         take it into account.

      5. Ms Farrell made no submission to the contrary.

      6. There is no error of law by the First-tier Tribunal judge declining
         to take the new matter into account in reaching his decision.

      7. No other grounds of appeal were submitted.

    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

    I do not set  aside  the  decision;  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal judge dismissing the appellant's appeal on all grounds stands.



    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

    I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
