                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant in this appeal  was  the  Respondent  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing on 28 July 2014 before Judge R J N B Morris.  However,
    for ease of reference,  the  Appellant  and  Respondent  are  hereafter
    referred to as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.  Therefore  Ms
    Vhuyan is referred to as  the  Appellant  and  Secretary  of  State  is
    referred to as the Respondent.


 2. The Appellant, a female citizen of Bangladesh,  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant pursuant to para 245ZX  of
    HC 395, as amended (the Immigration Rules). Her application was refused
    pursuant to 245ZX(h) because, due to her previous grants of leave as  a
    Tier  4  student,  if  leave  was  granted  pursuant  to  her   current
    application, she would have spent more than three years in the UK as  a
    Tier 4 student since the age of 18 studying courses which consisted  of
    below degree level study. She appealed and her appeal  was  allowed  by
    Judge Morris, who found that the periods  of  leave  that  fell  to  be
    counted were those during which the Appellant was actually studying and
    she had not in fact been engaged in study  throughout  the  periods  of
    leave she had been granted.


 3. The Respondent sought permission to appeal on  the  very  narrow  point
    that it was provided in Islam (Paragraph 245(ha):  five  years'  study:
    Bangladesh) [2013] UKUT 608 (IAC) that all Tier 4  leave  during  which
    the Appellant was present in the UK fell to be counted towards  the  36
    month total specified under paragraph 245ZX (h). It was submitted  that
    Islam provided that "It is the period of leave and not the actual study
    which is the measure for calculating the period of leave spent  in  the
    UK imposed by para 245ZX (ha)."

 4. Permission was granted on the basis that it was arguable that the Judge
    had misinterpreted the relevant rule.

 5. A Rule 24 response was not submitted on behalf of the Appellant but  Mr
    Islam submitted that the law had been correctly applied by the Judge.

The Hearing

 6. At the outset of the hearing, I  asked  the  parties  to  identify  the
    periods of  leave  that  were  under  consideration.  They  agreed  the
    following:

        a. The Appellant was  granted  Tier  4  leave  for  the  period  29
           September 2010 until 31 January 2012. She arrived in the UK on 1
           October 2010 and returned to Bangladesh due to ill health on  18
           February 2011 and her leave was cancelled. She was therefore  in
           the UK as a Tier 4 Migrant for 4 months and 17 days.

        b. She was issued with a visa as a Tier 4 Migrant for the period  7
           September 2012 until 17 October 2013. She entered the  UK  on  7
           September and has remained here ever since.

        c. Her current application, made on 17 October 2013, was for  leave
           to remain as a Tier 4 Migrant for a  course  which  was  due  to
           finish on 24 July 2015.

 7. Mr Kandola submitted that taking all the periods of leave into account,
    the Appellant would have been in the UK as a Tier 4 Migrant for over 36
    months.


 8. I note that the aggregate period of leave within the UK  as  a  Tier  4
    Migrant would be 3 years, 4 months and 12 days (4 months  and  17  days
    plus 2 years 11 months and 15 days). However, Islam, at  paragraph  13,
    expressly referred to the need to  exclude  the  pre-  and  post-course
    leave  referred  to  at  paragraph  245ZY  (b)  for  the  purposes   of
    calculating leave. I asked Mr Kandola whether the periods  referred  to
    at paragraph 245ZY (b) had been factored into the calculation  so  that
    pre and post study leave was not counted. He stated that  according  to
    the terms of 245ZY (b), if the paragraph was in force at  the  date  of
    decision, they would need to be  factored  in  and  if  they  were,  he
    accepted that the Appellant would not have exceeded  the  permitted  36
    months leave set out in paragraph 245ZX(h). His only query was  whether
    the provisions of paragraph 25ZY(b) were in force at the relevant time.




 9. I have considered the various amendments to the Immigration  Rules  and
    paragraph 245ZY(b) was in force at the date of decision.  The  relevant
    paragraphs were inserted on 31 March 2009, have been amended over  time
    but have in substance remained the same ever since. On the  basis  that
    Mr Kandola accepted that the effect of not counting pre- and post-study
    leave meant that the Appellant had not spent more than 36 months in the
    UK as a  Tier  4  Migrant  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  paragraph
    245ZX(h), I find that there are  no  material  errors  of  law  in  the
    determination of Judge Morris.


Decision

10. The determination of Judge Morris contains no material errors  of  law.
    Her decision must therefore stand.

Anonymity


11. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)
   of the Asylum and immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and we  see
   no reason why an order should be made pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal
   Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have considered whether to make a fee award. I have had regard to the
Joint Presidential Guidance Note: Fee Awards in Immigration Appeals
(December 2011). As the Respondent's appeal has been dismissed, the
decision of Judge Morris as to the fee award shall also stand.
