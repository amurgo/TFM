For the Appellant:     Mr M Mozam (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Williams (Senior HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Jessica Pacey, promulgated on 2nd August 2018, following a  hearing  at
    Nottingham Justice Centre on 23rd July  2018.   In  the  decision,  the
    judge dismissed the appeal of the Appellant,  whereupon  the  Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, and  was  born  on  6th
    June 1972.  He appealed against the decision of  the  Respondent  dated
    12th February 2018, refusing his application for leave to remain in the
    UK on the basis of his family life.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim is that he has a family life  with
    his children, one born on 7th January 2000, and the other born on  17th
    August 2011, both of whom are his daughters, whom he sees at  weekends.
    His daughters, however, live with their mother.  It is he who  provides
    them with financial support.  He himself had come to the UK in November
    2000 and was then granted leave  to  remain  as  a  spouse  until  12th
    September 2005.  Further applications for  permission  to  remain  were
    rejected until his application for leave  to  remain  on  human  rights
    grounds was granted until 19th March 2017.  The Appellant  claims  that
    he plays an  active  role  in  the  daughters'  lives  and  contributes
    financially.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge heard evidence from the Appellant's brother, Mr [R],  and  he
    heard evidence from Mr [Q].  The judge did not  find  the  evidence  of
    either to be plausible (see paragraphs 42 to 44).  The  judge  did  not
    have evidence at the hearing from the Appellant's daughters who did not
    attend and did not find credible the reasons for their not attending.

 5. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the judge  had  failed  to  begin
    from the starting point that the Appellant previously had been  granted
    leave to remain in the UK on the basis of  his  family  life  with  his
    children.  The Home Office had accepted this  evidence.   The  evidence
    also showed  that  the  Appellant  had  met  the  children  at  various
    different times and  there  were  photographs  in  the  bundle  of  the
    Appellant with his children.  In the circumstances, the starting  point
    had been overlooked by the judge.  Second, the  judge  failed  to  find
    that the witness statement signed by the Appellant's  daughter,  stated
    that her father had an active role in her life.  No weight was given by
    the judge to this statement.

 7. On 17th September 2018 permission to appeal was granted by the Tribunal
    on the basis that the judge's conclusion that the parental relationship
    between the Appellant and his younger daughter had not been shown  (see
    paragraph 51) and that he did not play an active role in her upbringing
    (paragraph  45)  may  have  been  in  error  in  that  it  ignored  the
    materiality of evidence before the Tribunal.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 17th  May  2019,  Mr  Mozam,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, furnished a well-compiled  skeleton  argument,
    which he used as the basis of his submissions before the Tribunal.   He
    began by asserting that the starting point of the consideration by  the
    judge of this appeal should have been that the  Appellant  had  already
    been recognised as a family member, with leave being granted to  remain
    here on this basis, on  a  previous  occasion.   Those  facts  had  not
    changed.

 9. Second, against that background, the judge's finding (at paragraph  45)
    that the Appellant did not have access to his youngest daughter was not
    properly made out.  The Appellant provided firm views which set out his
    contact with his daughter and photographs at various times which  shows
    him being with his daughter.  The Appellant  provided  two  statements:
    one with the application and  another  subsequently  demonstrating  the
    active role that he played in the lives of his daughters.

10. Third, notwithstanding the evidence of photographs,  phone  calls,  and
    the Home Office previously having accepted the contact of the Appellant
    with his daughter, the judge concluded that the Appellant did not  have
    direct contact with his daughter.

11. Fourth, the judge stated (at paragraph 45) that "I am not satisfied ...
    that the Appellant has access to his daughter since" and this seemed to
    indicate that the Appellant did have access to the  child  before,  but
    did not subsequently, but the sentence is  an  inconclusive  one.   The
    judge had not made the finding that the Appellant was granted leave  on
    the basis of family life previously.

12. Fifth, the judge  rejected  the  Appellant's  claim  on  the  basis  of
    credibility (at paragraphs 35 to 38).   It  was  not  credible  that  a
    father would drive his child to school,  spend  the  weekend  with  the
    child without a court order, for reasons that are not made out.

13. Finally, the judge did not give sufficient  weight  to  the  daughter's
    evidence in her witness statement that the parents  were  not  on  good
    terms at the moment and  the  Appellant  did  not  want  to  cause  any
    difficulties for the daughter by requiring her to attend court to  give
    evidence in support of him.  The Appellant's evidence was that  if  the
    mother found out about  this  she  would  have  an  argument  with  the
    daughters and make life difficult for  them.   The  judge  misconstrued
    this evidence.  There was no evidence from  the  mother  that  she  had
    prevented the daughter from giving  evidence  or  was  hostile  to  the
    daughter attending.  The judge's reasons (at paragraphs 35 to  38)  did
    not factor this in.

14. For his part, Mr Williams submitted that firstly, it was not true  that
    the judge had not proceeded on the basis that there had been a previous
    grant of leave to remain to the Appellant on the basis  of  his  family
    life.  Second, the judge, had reviewed the  evidence  before  him,  was
    clear that the Appellant "has not provided evidence that he is  taking,
    and intends to continue to take, an  active  role  in  'the  daughters'
    upbringing" (paragraph 45).  Third, with respect  to  the  photographic
    evidence, it was simply not true that the judge had failed to take this
    into account (see page 62 of the Appellant's bundle).  In fact, if  one
    looks at the photographic evidence, it ranges  across  the  years  from
    when the daughters were less than 5 years old, and are being fed by the
    Appellant as their father, to when they were about 10 years old, and to
    when they are seen to be holding an old ï¿½10 note.   Whatever  may  have
    been the position in the past, and  it  is  clear  that  permission  to
    remain had been granted to the Appellant on the basis of family life in
    the past, that was not the position now.  The judge was  not  satisfied
    that the daughter was being driven by the  Appellant  to  her  college.
    The judge was not satisfied that the Appellant took the daughter to the
    dentist.   The  daughters  themselves  do  not  say  in  their  witness
    statement that their father picked them up from school every day.

15. In reply, Mr Mozam submitted that there was actual  evidence  from  the
    dentist's surgery himself that the father had accompanied the daughters
    to the dentist.  The photographs, by the mere fact that they  showed  a
    range of years, demonstrated the extent of the Appellant's  involvement
    in their lives.

No Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007), such that I should set aside the decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

17. First, it is not the case that the judge is unaware of the  basis  upon
    which the previous grant of leave to remain was given to the Appellant.
     The judge states at the outset that, after the  Appellant's  leave  to
    remain as a spouse  expired  on  12th  September  2005  that,  "Further
    applications for leave were rejected until his application for leave to
    remain on human rights grounds was granted until 19th March 2017"  (see
    paragraph 4).

18. Second, just because there had been a previous grant of leave to remain
    in 2017, on the basis of the Appellant's involvement in  the  lives  of
    his daughters, did not mean that upon a  subsequent  fresh  application
    being made, that the facts do not have to  be  proven  to  that  effect
    again.  The judge looked at the facts as they were before the  Tribunal
    on this occasion.  The judge concluded that they  were  not  what  they
    were in the past.  The judge gave reasons for this.  For  example,  the
    evidence from Mr [R] was that  the  Appellant's  mother  drove  her  to
    school because there was no school bus and they did not like  it.   The
    judge concluded, "I do not consider it credible that there is no  means
    of reaching school other than by car.  In any event it is  not  Bemrose
    school but college which the daughters attend".  Indeed, the judge went
    on to say that "it is in my view in the highest  degree  unlikely  that
    the daughters, who live in Derby,  not  in  an  isolated  village,  are
    unable to reach their college save by having their father  drive  them"
    (paragraph 43).

19. In the same way, whilst I accept that there is a letter from one of the
    daughter's dentists, dated  4th  July  2018,  which  states  that  "the
    Appellant attended the dentist with her on three occasions in 2016  and
    2017" (see the judge's decision at paragraph 18), the  judge  is  fully
    aware of this evidence and sets it out, but the judge's  evaluation  of
    this evidence is that, "There is no evidence that either  daughter  has
    dental problems so it is reasonable to suppose that  the  only  dentist
    appointments they have are regular six months check-up" and in  fact  a
    letter from one of the daughter's dentists refers to one appointment in
    2016 and two in 2017, and there is no evidence that the other  daughter
    ever goes to the dentist, whether accompanied or not (paragraph 33).

20. The reason why all of this is important is because what  the  Appellant
    has to show is that he plays an active role in  the  daughters'  lives.
    The Appellant's evidence, which the judge sets out is  that  he  picked
    them up from their school every day and took them to, and  picked  them
    up from school.  He also took them to any appointments  they  had.   He
    provided financially  for  the  daughters.   He  gave  them  money  for
    clothes.  Moreover, "His daughters needed him around and  they  heavily
    relied on him" (see  paragraph  9  of  the  decision).   The  daughters
    themselves did not attend court to give evidence.  The explanation  for
    this, as confirmed by Mr Mozam before me today, is that  the  Appellant
    as the father,  did  not  wish  to  create  any  friction  between  his
    daughters and their mother, with whom he  was  not  on  good  terms  at
    present.

21. However, the judge deals with this and states that  the  evidence  from
    the Appellant was that the daughters' "mother had no  issues  with  his
    meeting the children and was happy he was  taking  responsibility"  and
    that therefore, "if this is true, then it is  unclear  why  the  mother
    would resist her  daughters'  supporting  their  father's  appeal  ..."
    (paragraph  41).   Accordingly,  the  judge's  conclusion  that,   "the
    Appellant does not  have  any  great  degree  of  involvement  in  [his
    daughter's] life, the decision is not disproportionate" (paragraph  50)
    is also correct under Article 8.  The judge gave ample  reasons,  in  a
    comprehensive decision, why the appeal could not  succeed.   The  judge
    was entitled to come to the conclusions that  she  did.   There  is  no
    error of law.
