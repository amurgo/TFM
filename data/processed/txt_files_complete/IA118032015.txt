Representation:
For the Claimant: Mrs H Aboni (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr A Ullah (Sponsor)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1.  The claimant, before the Upper Tribunal is the Secretary of State  for
    the  Home  Department  (hereinafter  "the  Secretary  of  State").  The
    respondent before the Upper Tribunal is Mrs  Lakhal  Hind  (hereinafter
    "the claimant"). This is the Secretary of State's appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, brought with the permission of a Judge of the Upper Tribunal,
    against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Sills  hereinafter
    "the Judge") promulgated on 21 September 2015, allowing the  claimant's
    appeal against a decision of 19 March 2015 refusing to  vary  leave  to
    remain and deciding to remove her from the  UK  by  way  of  directions
    under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. By way of background, the claimant is a female national of Morocco  who
    was born on 3 August 1989. She is married to one Mr Assad Ullah, who is
    a British citizen, and there is one child of the union, [YU],  who  was
    born on 17 March 2014 in Morocco but who is a British citizen.

 3. The claimant and Mr Ullah married  each  other  on  27  November  2012.
    Thereafter, in April 2013, the claimant applied for entry clearance  to
    come to the UK as a visitor.  That  application  was  refused  but  she
    appealed. The appeal was allowed  after  an  oral  hearing  which  took
    place, I think, in  January  2014.  Mr  Ullah  gave  evidence  at  that
    hearing.  On 20 September 2014, in consequence of the successful  visit
    visa appeal, the claimant and [Y] entered  the  UK.   They  were  given
    leave to enter as visitors and have subsequently resided here  with  Mr
    Ullah.  On 24 November 2014 the  claimant  applied  to  vary  leave  to
    remain on the basis of her marriage.

 4. In refusing the application and deciding to remove  the  claimant,  the
    Secretary of State expressed the view that she could not succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules relating to the "partner route"  or  the  "parent
    route" because, having only ever had leave as a visitor,  she  did  not
    satisfy what are referred to as the  "eligibility"  requirements.  Nor,
    said the Secretary of State, did she meet the requirements of Paragraph
    276 ADE of the Immigration Rules given her  connections  with  Morocco.
    Further, with respect to the possible applicability of Article 8 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights (hereinafter  "the  ECHR")  outside
    the Rules, there were no exceptional circumstances  so  she  could  not
    succeed in reliance upon that provision.

 5. The claimant's appeal against the decision of 19 March 2015  was  heard
    on 17 August 2015. The Judge received oral evidence from  the  claimant
    and the sponsor. Both parties were represented. Despite what appear  to
    have been quite ambitious submissions made on behalf  of  the  claimant
    the Judge concluded, correctly I am sure, that she could not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules because of her  only  having  had
    leave as a visitor (see  Paragraph  E-LTRP.2.1  of  Appendix  FM).  The
    Judge, though, decided that there were grounds for considering the case
    outside of the Immigration Rules and, indeed,  went  on  to  allow  the
    appeal under Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules. In  that  context
    the Judge accepted that the claimant and sponsor had a genuine marriage
    and that both had a genuine parental relationship with [Y].  The  Judge
    did, though, also conclude, and on the facts this  is  not  surprising,
    that  they  had  both  shown  a  blatant  disregard   for   immigration
    requirements in that, as a  minimum,  at  the  time  the  claimant  had
    entered the United Kingdom she and the sponsor did not intend that  she
    would return.

 6. In explaining why the appeal was being allowed the Judge said this;

         "19. I agree with the Respondent that the Appellant cannot meet the
             requirements of the Immigration Rules.  This  is  because  the
             Appellant cannot satisfy E-LTRP.2.1 as  she  has  leave  as  a
             visitor. Hence the appeal under the rules must be dismissed.

         20.  It is worth noting two further points about the decision under
             the rules. First, the application was not  refused  under  the
             suitability provisions. Second, the Respondent did not  go  on
             to consider whether EX.1 applied. While EX.1 is not  a  stand-
             alone provision, s117B(6) is in identical terms, and this must
             be considered below.

         21.  I go on to consider the Appellant's case  outside  the  rules.
             There are arguably good grounds for granting leave outside the
             rules in this case. The case relates to a young British child.
             The interests of the child have not been taken into account in
             the decision under the rules as the application was refused on
             the basis of the Appellant's immigration status alone.

         22.  S117B(6) set out above is key to  the  Appellant's  case.  The
             Appellant is not liable to deportation. As  the  mother  of  a
             British child who has cared for the child since birth, she has
             a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship   with   a
             qualifying child.

         23.  The Respondent's own policy states that in such  circumstances
             it would be unreasonable to expect the child to leave the  UK.
             The Respondent's current policy on  Appendix  FM,  updated  in
             April 2015, is Immigration Directorate  Instruction  -  Family
             Migration: Appendix FM  Section  1.0b  -  Family  Life  (as  a
             Partner or Parent) and Private Life: 10-Year Routes. It states
             as follows in relevant part:

                  11.2.3. Would it  be  unreasonable  to  expect  a  British
                  Citizen child to leave the UK?

                  Where a decision to refuse the application would require a
                  parent or primary carer to return to a country outside the
                  EU, the case must always be assessed on the basis that  it
                  would be unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to
                  leave the EU with that parent or primary carer.

         24.  Applying the Respondent's own policy,  which  itself  reflects
             the Zambrano principle, the Appellant's case must be  assessed
             on the basis that it would be unreasonable to  leave  the  EU,
             and thus in this case the UK. Hence the  Appellant  meets  the
             requirements of s117B(6).

         25.  The question then is whether this requires the  appeal  to  be
             allowed. There is not binding authority  on  this  issue.  The
             point was subject to obiter consideration in Bossade (ss117A-D-
             interrelationship with Rules) [2015] UKUT 00415 (IAC) at  ï¿½38-
             39. It stated that while the other provisions  of  s117B  were
             neither necessary nor sufficient conditions, s117B(6) might be
             argued  to  operate  as  a   self-contained   set   if   legal
             requirements  providing  a  complete  answer  to  the  "public
             interest question".

         26.  Bossade refers to the ECHR Memorandum  which  accompanied  the
             Immigration Bill. Of this provision it states:

                  74.  This is self-explanatory and is intended  to  broadly
                  reflect case law. It provides that certain  countervailing
                  factors will not justify removal in  an  immigration  case
                  (it does not apply to  criminals  or  other  non-conducive
                  deportations).

         27.  As is suggested  by  the  ECHR  Memorandum,  the  language  of
             s117B(6) is clear, it sets out conditions, which if  satisfied
             means the  public  interest  does  not  require  the  person's
             removal provided they are not liable to deportation. Therefore
             in this  case,  the  public  interest  does  not  require  the
             Appellant's removal. I find that this must be a compelling and
             determinative factor in the Appellant's favour when the Razgar
             test is applied to her case.

         28.  I find that the Appellant's removal would interfere  with  the
             family life of the Appellant and her family with  consequences
             of such gravity  as  to  engage  Article  8.  The  Appellant's
             removal will mean either the Appellant  being  separated  from
             her 18-month-old daughter, who she has cared for since  birth,
             or the Appellant and her child being separated from Mr  Ullah,
             or alternatively  Mr  Ullah  and  the  daughter,  two  British
             citizens, being forced to leave the  UK.  These  circumstances
             clearly  engage  Article  8.  The  interference  would  be  in
             accordance with the law.

         29.  However, as Parliament has stated  that  the  public  interest
             does not require the Appellant's  removal,  I  find  that  the
             interference  has  been  found  not  to  be  necessary  in   a
             democratic society. In the alternative, I  find  that  as  the
             public interest does not require the Appellant's  removal,  it
             must follow that the interference is disproportionate.

         30.  The Respondent rightly raised the  issue  of  the  Appellant's
             disregard for immigration control, and the above analysis begs
             the question as to what weight this has in the proportionality
             assessment. In my view, by introducing s117B  set  out  above,
             Parliament  has  limited  discretion  of   the   Tribunal   in
             determining appeals based on  ECHR  Article  8.  It  sets  out
             mandatory factors to be taken into account, and determines the
             weight to be accorded to factors in specific circumstances. As
             set out in the ECHR Memorandum, s117B(6) provides that certain
             countervailing  factors  will  not  justify  removal   in   an
             immigration case. The terms of s117B(6) make it clear that the
             Appellant's adverse conduct is  not  sufficiently  adverse  to
             outweigh the interests of her British citizen child.

         31.  For the above  reasons,  the  appeal  is  allowed  under  ECHR
             Article 8."

 7.  That was not the end of the matter  because  the  Secretary  of  State
    applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  contending,  in
    summary, that the Judge had erred in failing to identify a sufficiently
    compelling reason for  allowing  the  appeal  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules; in failing to factor  in  the  claimant's  lack  of  ability  to
    satisfy the financial requirements within the  rules  when  considering
    the question of proportionality and  in  misapplying  the  Home  Office
    policy provisions referred to at Paragraph  23  of  the  Determination.
    Although permission was originally refused by a Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal it was subsequently granted by a Judge of the  Upper  Tribunal
    who said this;

         "It is arguable that Judge Sills may have  erred  in  applying  the
         Respondent's policy. As the child's father is in the UK,  there  is
         no reason to think that the child would have to leave the UK if the
         appellant were to return to Morocco  to  make  an  entry  clearance
         application.

         Whilst it is correct that the Judge considered the  possibility  of
         the appellant being separated from the child (Para. 28), it appears
         he did not consider the possibility of temporary separation. It  is
         also arguable that he did not take into account that the family  do
         not satisfy  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE.  Chikwamba  is
         arguably distinguishable on the ground that the appellant does  not
         satisfy the requirements for entry clearance.

         Finally, the Judge may have erred in applying s. 117B(6) as a stand
         alone provision."

 8. Permission having been granted, a hearing was convened before the Upper
    Tribunal (before me) so  that  consideration  could  be  given  to  the
    question of whether the Judge had erred in law and, if so, what  should
    flow from that. Although the claimant had had legal  representation  in
    the past, the sponsor spoke on her behalf at  the  hearing.  Mrs  Aboni
    represented the Secretary of State.

 9. Mrs  Aboni  relied  upon  the  grounds  of  application  which  I  have
    summarised  above.  She  contended  that  the  Judge  had   failed   to
    demonstrate that there were any compelling  circumstances  such  as  to
    justify the allowing of the appeal and compelling  circumstances  would
    be required following what had been stated in SS Congo (2015) EWCA  Civ
    387. Further, the Judge had focussed too  much  upon  the  question  of
    whether the British citizen child  should  be  expected  to  leave  the
    United  Kingdom  and  had  not  considered  other  possible   scenarios
    including the claimant leaving alone to apply for entry clearance  from
    Morocco.  Having heard from Mrs Aboni I informed the parties that I had
    decided not to set aside the decision of the Judge. My reasoning, as to
    that, appears below.

10. The Judge was clearly aware of the point that compelling  circumstances
    had to be identified if an appeal were to be allowed under Article 8 of
    the ECHR outside the Immigration Rules. He quoted the relevant  passage
    from the judgment in SS  in  his  determination.  It  cannot  be  said,
    therefore, that the requirement was  ignored.  He  identified,  in  his
    determination, the point that the new statutory regime (I have in  mind
    section 117B(6) of the amended Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002) did not require this claimant's removal. He expressly  said  that
    that must be a "compelling" factor.  So,  he  did  identify  compelling
    circumstances.

11. As to the guidance, I cannot see how it can properly be said  that  the
    Judge misapplied it in any way. Although it is said in the grounds that
    the Judge had referred to "an out of date policy" it is also said  that
    the  current  policy  is  not  materially  different.  The  Judge   was
    considering the policy in  the  context  of  the  factors  said  to  be
    relevant to Section 117B(6)(a) and (b). The Judge accepted  that  there
    was a subsisting parental relationship with  a  qualifying  child  and,
    indeed, that conclusion has not been  the  subject  of  any  subsequent
    challenge. The Judge then had to go on  to  consider  the  question  of
    whether it would or would not be reasonable to expect  that  qualifying
    child to leave the United Kingdom. Given the   policy  as  it  was  the
    Judge decided he  could  not  rationally  conclude  that  it  would  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK and that conclusion  was
    clearly open to him. I am really not sure how  he  could  realistically
    have reached any other conclusion. The question he had to ask  himself,
    in that context, was not about whether there might  be  other  possible
    scenarios such as a  mother  going  to  Morocco  alone  to  seek  entry
    clearance or the mother and child going back to Morocco to  seek  entry
    clearance. He had to answer the  simple  and  straightforward  question
    posed by 117B(6)(b). That is exactly what he did.

12. It does not seem to me that it can be realistically contended that  the
    Judge failed to consider, although he  was  working  and  earning,  the
    sponsor's inability  to  reach  the  financial  threshold  set  by  the
    financial requirements of the Rules. On the  Judge's  reasoning,  which
    was open to him, that was not a factor of any  significance  given  the
    view  he  took  about  Section  117B(6)  (see  paragraph  27   of   his
    determination) but, in any event, he was aware of the inability of  the
    sponsor to reach the threshold because he  had  specifically  commented
    upon it at  paragraph  4  of  his  determination.  Finally,  whilst  it
    certainly does appear that the Judge treated 117B(6)  as  determinative
    (see the closing sentence of paragraph  27  of  his  determination)  he
    explained in the preceding paragraphs why  he  was  doing  so  and  the
    decision in Treebhawon and others (section  117B(6))  (2015)  UKUT  674
    (IAC) would certainly seem very supportive of  that  approach.  On  the
    current state of the authorities I cannot see how the proposition  that
    he erred in law in that regard can be made good.

13. In the above circumstances, therefore, the Judge did not  err  and  his
    determination shall stand.

Decision

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error of law. That decision shall stand.

15. No anonymity direction is made.
