For the Respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of the  Philippines,  born  on  26  June  1983
    appeals, with permission, against a decision of Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Cresswell who in a determination promulgated  on  8  May  2013
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against a decision of the Secretary of
    State to refuse the appellant a further extension of stay as a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant under paragraph 245ZX of HC 395 as amended.

2.   The appellant made an application on 31 July 2012 for leave  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  under  the
    points-based system.  Her application was refused on  8  January  2013,
    the reason being it was not  accepted  that  she  met  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules.  The  relevant  section  of  the  letter  of
    refusal dated 8 January 2013 stated that:-

         "As you are studying outside of [sic] Inner-London you  would  need
         to show that you:


           o Have the required funds  to  cover  the  fees  for  the  first
             academic year of your course as the course is twelve months or
             more; and


           o Have the required funds of �800  a  month  for  2  months  for
             yourself.

         Therefore you would have  to  prove  that  you  have  the  required
         maintenance fees of �1,600 plus any outstanding course fees for the
         first year of your course.  Your course fees  are  �2,000  for  the
         first year of your course and you have paid this fee in full.


         Paragraph 1A(h) of Appendix C of the Immigration Rules states:


             'the end date of the  90-day  and  28-day  periods....will  be
             taken as the date of the closing balance on the most recent of
             the specified documents, and must be no earlier than  31  days
             before the date of application.


         As such, you are required to show that you  are  in  possession  of
         �1,600 for a consecutive 28 day period to meet the Tier 4 (General)
         Student Migrant Maintenance (funds)  requirements  as  required  by
         paragraph 1A of Appendix C of  the  Immigration  Rules.     As  the
         closing date of the bank statements submitted in  support  of  your
         application is dated 13 July 2012, you need  to  snow  evidence  of
         �1,600 maintenance for 28 days from 16 June 2012 to 13 July 2012.


         However, between 26 June 2012 and 1 July 2012 your bank  statements
         state that you were in possession of no more than �1,560.98.


         As such, you have not demonstrated that you have the level of funds
         required over the specified 28-day period to be granted as a Tier 4
         (General) Student Migrant.


         It  has  therefore  been  decided  that  you  have  not   met   the
         requirements as specified  within  the  Immigration  Rules  and  no
         points have been awarded for Maintenance (funds)."


3.   Judge Creswell set out her findings of fact in  paragraphs  15  onwards
    of the determination.  She noted that Mr Ifere had  "properly  conceded
    that the appellant did not meet the requirements of  the  Rules".   She
    went on to say that Section 19 of the Borders Act 2007 and Section  85A
    of the 2002 Act applied to the determination of the  appeal,  with  the
    result that she was precluded from considering any evidence other  than
    that which was submitted at the time of  the  application,  unless  the
    additional evidence was adduced to  prove  that  a  document  that  was
    submitted is genuine or valid.

4.   In paragraphs 18 onwards she dealt with the issue of the rights of  the
    appellant under Article 8 of the ECHR, concluding that the  removal  of
    the appellant would not be an infringement of those rights.

5.   She therefore, having  found  that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules dismissed the appeal on both immigration  and
    human rights grounds.

6.   The appellant appealed, arguing that the respondent  had  not  followed
    the policies set out in the respondent's letter of 19  May  2011  which
    had stated that during a trial stage  applicants  should  be  contacted
    when mandatory evidence was missing from their  applications  and  that
    the applicant  would be given  an  opportunity  to  provide  this.  The
    grounds relied  on the determination in the case of Rodriguez (flexible
    policy) [2013 UKUT 42 (IAC).  The grounds stated that the  relevant  28
    day period was between 2 July 2012 and 30 July 2012 as the  application
    was made on 31 July.  As  the  appellant  had  not  produced  the  bank
    statements after 13 July it appeared to be argued that the Secretary of
    State should have requested the bank statements for the  period  to  30
    July 2012 and it was claimed that  those  would  have  shown  that  the
    appellant had met the maintenance requirements of the Rules.

7.   The grounds also claimed that the decision on the issue of the  private
    life of the appellant was wrong.

8.   At the hearing of the  appeal  before  me  Mr  Ifere  referred  to  the
    grounds of appeal and to the determination in Rodriguez although he did
    not have a copy of that determination to place before me.

9.   In reply Mr Parkinson stated that the reality was  that  the  appellant
    was required to produce bank statements covering a 28 day period ending
    not earlier than 31 days before the date of the application.  The  bank
    statements which the appellant had submitted did cover a 28 day  period
    and therefore there was nothing to indicate that any bank statement was
    missing and therefore there was no lacuna in the evidence on which  the
    application of the policy set out in the letter of 19  May  2011  could
    bite.  The reality was that the appellant had produced bank  statements
    for the requisite period and they showed that  she  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.  There  was  therefore  no  requirement  for
    further evidence.

10.  He added, in reply to Mr Ifere's claim that it had  not  been  conceded
    at the hearing of the appeal that the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules that the Presenting  Officer's  note  of  the
    hearing recorded that Mr Ifere had made that concession.

11.  Mr Ifere, in reply, merely stated that had the bank statements for  the
    period immediately before the application been requested the  appellant
    would have been able to show that  she  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

12.  I consider there is no material error of law in  the  determination  of
    the First-tier Judge.  The reality is that the  judge  had  before  her
    bank statements for the relevant period.   I  consider  that  what  was
    written in the determination, which  is  echoed  by  the  note  of  the
    Presenting Officer did accurately reflect the fact that it was conceded
    at he hearing of the appeal in the First-tier that the appeal could not
    succeed under the Immigration Rules.  It is clear that  there  were  no
    lacunae in the bank statements which were produced  which  should  have
    triggered an inquiry by the respondent as to the existence  of  further
    monies.

13.  I further consider that the Immigration Judge dealt properly  with  the
    issue of the rights of the appellant under Article 8 of the ECHR taking
    into account the fact that the appellant had now been in Britain for  a
    number of years and who had obtained the qualifications which  she  had
    set out to obtain when she was initially granted entry clearance.   The
    judge had taken into account the friendships which the appellant  would
    have made here as well as her relationship with her boyfriend.

14.  I therefore find that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the Immigration Judge and that her decision dismissing
    this appeal on both immigration and human rights grounds shall stand.
