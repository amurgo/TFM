                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants have been granted permission to appeal from the decision
    of the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Obhi  sitting  at  Priory  Courts,
    Birmingham on 17  July  2018)  dismissing  their  appeals  against  the
    decision of the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  ("the
    Department") to refuse to grant them leave to remain on the grounds  of
    family and private life established in the UK.  The First-tier Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity direction, and I do not consider that such  a
    direction is warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

Relevant Background

 2. The first appellant, Mrs Jayraj, is a national of India, whose date  of
    birth  is  25  December  1965.   The  second  appellant,  Miss  Desarie
    Annadurai, is one of her two daughters.  She was born in  India  on  28
    August 1996.  Her younger sister, Miss Eda Annadurai, was born in India
    on 9 June 2000.   The  two  children  entered  the  United  Kingdom  as
    dependants of their mother on 16 July 2009.   In  the  preceding  three
    years from 2006 they had resided with their mother in Saudi Arabia.

 3. The children entered  the  UK  as  Tier  4  (General  student)  migrant
    dependants.  Mrs Jayraj successfully extended her leave to remain as  a
    student on three occasions, and the  children  were  granted  leave  to
    remain as dependants in line with her.  Their last grant  of  leave  to
    remain ran until 12 January 2015.  On 16 September 2014 their leave was
    curtailed so as to expire on 18 November 2014.  On 6 November 2014  Mrs
    Jayraj applied for further leave to remain as a Tier 2 migrant, and  on
    25 November 2014 she was granted leave to remain in this capacity,  and
    the children were granted leave to remain in line with her.

 4. Mrs Jayraj was granted leave to work at a specified Nursing Home  as  a
    Band 3 Nurse.  Her sponsor's licence was subsequently  revoked  by  the
    Department, and as a consequence  the  leave  of  the  mother  and  the
    children was curtailed on 18 April 2016 so as  to  expire  on  20  June
    2016.  Mrs Jayraj was unable to find an alternative sponsor, and so  on
    18 June 2016 she applied on behalf of herself and the two children  for
    leave to remain on family and private life grounds.  On 16 January 2017
    the second appellant made an application for leave to remain in her own
    right  on  private  life  grounds.   The  genesis  for   the   separate
    application by the second  appellant  was  that,  in  response  to  the
    initial application, the Department  said  that  the  second  appellant
    could not apply as a dependent child as she was over the age of 18.

 5. On 2 April 2018 the Department gave  their  reasons  for  refusing  the
    application made by the second appellant. They  acknowledged  that  she
    had lived in the UK for seven years following her entry to the UK on 16
    July 2009.  But she was over the age of 18, and so she did not meet the
    requirements of Rule  276ADE(1)(iv).   A  decision  had  been  made  on
    whether there were exceptional circumstances in her  case  which  would
    render a refusal a breach of Article 8 ECHR because it would result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for her, a relevant child  or  another
    family member.  Based on the information provided, the  Department  had
    decided that there were no such exceptional circumstances in her  case.
    She said that she was dependent upon her mother,  who  she  lived  with
    along with her younger sister.  However, her mother's and  her  younger
    sister's  applications  were  refused  on  30  January  2018.   It  was
    considered that she could continue her family life with her mother  and
    younger sister in India.

 6. All three family members brought an appeal in the First-tier  Tribunal.
    The younger sister, Eda,  was  the  second  appellant  in  the  appeal,
    whereas Desarie was the third appellant.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. Both parties were legally represented before Judge Obhi.   As  recorded
    by Judge Obhi in paragraph [2] of his decision, at the  outset  of  the
    hearing the Presenting Officer notified him  that  the  Department  was
    withdrawing the refusal decision directed to the younger  sister,  Eda,
    with a view to granting  her  permission  to  remain  to  complete  her
    studies.  However, the decision in relation to the two other appellants
    was  maintained.   The  Judge  granted  the  Department  permission  to
    withdraw the decision against the younger sister.

 8. The Judge received oral evidence from the two remaining appellants.  In
    his closing submissions on behalf of  the  Department,  the  Presenting
    Officer  submitted  that  the  family  in  the   UK   comprised   three
    individuals.  The youngest member of the family would be  on  her  own,
    but she would be a student and no different from any others who were in
    the UK.  She could apply for a student loan as others  did.   Emotional
    support  could  just  as  easily  be  provided  from  abroad  as   from
    Wolverhampton.  He referred to the  case  of  Mohammed  Butt  -v-  SSHD
    [2017] EWCA Civ 184 as establishing that there was  no  breach  of  the
    Article 8 rights of family members where permission was granted to  two
    of them to remain and complete their studies.

 9. In reply, Counsel submitted that there were  exceptional  circumstances
    in the second appellant's case.  She had only been back to  India  once
    to attend a funeral in 2015.  She had excelled in  her  GCSEs  and  was
    getting ready to commence an apprenticeship in the UK.  She had  always
    lived with her mother and sister, and they formed a family  unit.   Her
    father was in India and  had  been  estranged  from  the  family  since
    Christmas 2015.  She had excellent links with the UK and her mother had
    a genuine and subsisting relationship with both her  children,  and  it
    was in their best interests for the family  to  remain  together.   Mrs
    Jayraj had a Masters qualification which she could use to work  in  the
    UK and earn a living.

10. The Judge held that the fact that the younger sister had  been  granted
    leave to remain was not a factor which made the  case  exceptional  for
    the other two family members.  Both the girls were now adults.  Many 18-
    year-olds left home to go to university.  There was no reason  why  Mrs
    Jayraj could not continue to provide her with  financial  support  from
    India.  Alternatively, Eda could apply for a  student  loan  to  assist
    with her education.







The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

11. On 24 January 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson granted  the  appellants
    permission to appeal for the following reasons: "It  is  arguable  that
    there is an inadequate analysis of the family life that exists  between
    the second appellant [Eda Annadurai]  and  her  mother  notwithstanding
    that the second appellant wishes to go to university.  It is  not  made
    out that the second appellant has formed an independent life or home of
    her own and like many students would ordinarily return home during  the
    holidays.   The second appellant is not going to be  removed  from  the
    United Kingdom, but the issue is whether it would be  proportionate  to
    remove her mother and sister in light  of  the  situation  accepted  to
    exist by the Secretary of State."

The Error of Law Hearing on 8 March 2019

12. At the outset of the hearing before me to determine whether an error of
    law was made out,  Ms  Bayati  informed  me  that  the  Department  had
    recently granted Mrs Jayraj leave to remain on  private  life  grounds.
    After she had outlined her case  as  to  where  this  left  the  second
    appellant, Mr Tarlow requested  a  short  adjournment  to  discuss  the
    matter with Ms Bayati outside. On resumption, Mr Tarlow  said  that  he
    was in agreement with Ms  Bayati  that  the  second  appellant's  human
    rights claim needed to be re-examined  in  the  light  of  the  changed
    factual matrix.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

13. After further discussion, it became apparent that Mr  Tarlow  supported
    Ms Bayati's case that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  erred  in  law
    for the reasons identified by Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson when granting
    permission.

14. Mr Tarlow's concession was not determinative of the issue,  but  I  was
    satisfied that an error of law was made out. The  original  refusal  of
    the applications of all three family  members  was  predicated  on  the
    proposition that all of them would be returning as  a  family  unit  to
    India.  The late withdrawal of the decision against the younger  sister
    changed this factual matrix. Although the younger sister was aged 18 at
    the date of the hearing, she had only celebrated her 18th birthday very
    recently. So applying the well-recognised no-bright line principle, she
    was to all intents and purposes still a child who required her mother's
    close proximity and support.  The Judge did not give  adequate  reasons
    for finding that in those circumstances the  enforced  removal  of  the
    mother would not constitute a breach of the right to respect for family
    life between a child just turned 18 and her mother.  In turn, the Judge
    did not give adequate consideration to the potential knock-on effect on
    the older sister, who remained a dependant on her mother, and  who  was
    an integral part of the family unit.

15. For the above reasons, an error of law is made out, and the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal with regard to the second appellant must be set
    aside and remade.




The Resumed Hearing on 26 April 2019

16. For the purposes of the remaking the decision in respect of the  second
    appellant, reliance was placed upon the same evidence that  was  before
    the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  appellant's  solicitors  filed  some
    additional  evidence  relating  to  the  second   appellant's   current
    situation. Both the second appellant and her mother were  tendered  for
    cross-examination.

17. In her witness statement of 11 April 2019, which she adopted as part of
    her evidence in chief, the second appellant said that she had lived  in
    the UK for nearly 10 years since moving to the UK at the age of  12  in
    July 2009.  She had spent all her teenage years in the UK, which  meant
    that her values and belief systems were formed by the UK society.   She
    attended All Nations Church every week.  She had been volunteering  and
    helping the church with various activities,  such  as  hosting  events,
    Sunday school, youth programmes, and through this she had built a  good
    fellowship with members of the church.

18. In June 2018 she had started  a  Level  2  Apprenticeship  in  Business
    Administration  with  the  church.   She  was  in  the  middle  of  her
    apprenticeship.  Once she has finished Level 2, she hoped to go  on  to
    Level 3.  If she was granted leave to remain, she  hoped  to  pursue  a
    career as a Youth Worker.

19. As her qualifications were only up until secondary  school  level,  she
    would be at a disadvantage when applying for further study or  work  in
    India, which would lead to her  struggling  financially.   "On  top  of
    this, I will not [have] the emotional support of my mother and  younger
    sister which will only make matters worse."

20. In answer to supplementary questions from Counsel, she  said  that  she
    was paid �593 per month as an apprentice.  Her father was living in the
    family home in India.  He was unemployed.  It was  very  hard  to  find
    work at his age.  He had been unemployed for 3 years now.  Her  younger
    sister was about to do her A levels, and was hoping to go to university
    in September.

21. In cross-examination, the second appellant agreed that she  could  live
    with her father in India, while  her  mother  remained  here  with  her
    younger sister.  But she would be restricted as a woman  in  the  areas
    that she would be allowed to work.  Without a  degree  there  would  be
    less opportunity to work in India.

22. In her witness statement, which she adopted as her evidence  in  chief,
    Mrs Jayraj said that she  had  been  supporting  her  daughter  Desarie
    physically, emotionally and financially since she joined her in the  UK
    at the age of 12.  Although she was now an adult, she completely relied
    on her at this stage of her life.  She depended on her financially  and
    emotionally.  She and her two daughters had always been bound  together
    as a family.  Separating Desarie from them  would  cause  them  massive
    distress as they relied on each other for support and they were a close
    family  unit.   The  money  that   Desarie   was   earning   from   her
    apprenticeship with the local church helped support "our family."

23. In answer to supplementary questions from Counsel, Mrs Jayraj said that
    she was working as a Health Care Assistant.  Together  with  an  agency
    job as a Kitchen Assistant, she had a total  annual  income  of  around
    �19,000 per annum.

24. In cross-examination, she said that Desarie was still dependent on  her
    father in the same way that Desarie was dependent upon her.  She agreed
    that if Desarie went to India, she could send her money.  But the money
    would not be enough.

25. In re-examination, she said that it would be  very  difficult  for  her
    daughter to lead an independent life in India.  In  their  culture,  it
    was for the mother to be free with their daughters.  In contrast to her
    relationship with her father, "she is more free with me."

26. In his closing submissions on behalf  of  the  Department,  Mr  Lindsay
    submitted that this was really a private life case, not  a  case  where
    there was a prospective interference with family life.  If it was  true
    that the second appellant was dependent on her father in the  same  way
    that she was dependent on her mother, then requiring her to  return  to
    India would not constitute a significant interference with family life.
     In any event, she could continue to enjoy a free-speaking relationship
    with her mother at a distance.

27.  In  reply,  Ms  Jaquiss  submitted  that  it  was  not  a  sustainable
    proposition that the second appellant  enjoyed  family  life  with  her
    father in the same way she did with her mother.  Clearly, the emotional
    ties to her father could not be the same as those which  she  had  with
    her mother, which were much stronger.  She referred  me  to  Singh  -v-
    SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 630 where Beatson  LJ  said  at  [24]:  "Love  and
    affection between an adult and his parents  or  siblings  will  not  of
    itself justify a finding of family life.  There  has  to  be  something
    more.  A young adult living with his parents or siblings will  normally
    have a family life to be respected under Article 8.  The child enjoying
    family life with his parents has not suddenly ceased to have  a  family
    life at midnight as he turns 18 years of age.  On  the  other  hand,  a
    young adult living independently of his parents may  well  not  have  a
    family life for the purposes of Article 8."

28.  She  submitted  that  the  second  appellant's   earnings   from   her
    apprenticeship were not enough to make her financially independent; and
    that the second  appellant  remained  emotionally  dependent  upon  her
    mother.

Discussion and Findings on Remaking

29. The evidence does not disclose a viable private life claim  under  Rule
    276ADE.  Turning to an Article 8 claim outside the Rules,  questions  1
    and 2 of the Razgar test plainly fall to be answered in the appellant's
    favour with regard to the establishment of  private  life  in  the  UK.
    Having considered the evidence in the round and the guidance  given  in
    Singh, I am also persuaded that the second appellant  continues  to  be
    emotionally dependent upon her mother, and that she continues to  enjoy
    family life for the purposes of Article 8  with  both  her  mother  and
    younger sister. I consider that  the  evidence  given  in  the  witness
    statements and by Mrs Jayraj in re-examination reflects the reality  of
    the situation, whereas the answer elicited from Mrs  Jayraj  in  cross-
    examination - see paragraph 24 above - does not. Accordingly, questions
    1 and 2 of the Razgar test also fall to be answered in the  appellant's
    favour with regard to the establishment of family life in the UK.

30. Questions 3 and 4 of the Razgar test must be answered in favour of  the
    Department.  On the issue of proportionality, I must take into  account
    the relevant public interest considerations arising under section  117B
    of the 2002 Act.  It is in the appellant's favour that she is  able  to
    speak English and that she is financially independent in the  sense  of
    not being reliant on the support of the State for her  maintenance  and
    accommodation.   Nonetheless,  Section  117B(5)  provides  that  little
    weight should be given to a private life established by a person  at  a
    time when the person's immigration status is precarious.

31.  However,  the  considerations  identified  in  section  117B  are  not
    exhaustive, and a departure from the generalised normative guidance  is
    justified in certain circumstances, including where  a  person  can  be
    said to have established a private life  of  a  special  or  compelling
    character.

32. On the Article 8(1) side of the equation, it  is  a  compelling  factor
    that more than half of her long lawful residence was built up while the
    second appellant was a child.  Added to this, she  continues  to  enjoy
    family life with her mother and younger  sister;  and  she  is  mid-way
    through an apprenticeship. On the Article 8(2) side  of  the  equation,
    the second appellant is only a few months away from having  accrued  10
    years' lawful residence in the UK, so as to be eligible  to  apply  for
    indefinite leave to remain on  the  grounds  of  10  years'  continuous
    lawful residence.

33. Accordingly, I find that the threatened interference with  private  and
    family life is not proportionate to the legitimate  end  sought  to  be
    achieved, namely the maintenance  of  firm  and  effective  immigration
    controls. So I allow the second appellant's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The first appellant's appeal shall  be  treated  as  abandoned  pursuant  to
section 104(4a) of the 2002 Act because, following the grant  of  permission
to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, she was granted leave to remain.

As to  the  second  appellant's  appeal,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal contained an error of law, and  accordingly  the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the following decision is  substituted:
the second appellant's appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
