Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Bandegani, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Raymond dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    refusal of the respondent to grant him leave to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom on the basis that he had not  achieved  ten  years'  continuous
    lawful residence due to having overstayed.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 9 January 1987.

3.   As the chronology of his immigration history is at  the  core  of  this
    claim, I shall set out what the respondent  said  in  her  Reasons  for
    Refusal Letter.

4.   The appellant first entered the United  Kingdom  on  7  May  2006  with
    entry clearance as a student, which was valid from 13 April 2006  until
    31 December 2007.

5.   He applied for leave to remain as a student on 14  December  2007,  and
    was granted leave in this capacity on 17 January 2008 until 31  October
    2008.

6.   He applied for leave to  remain  as  a  student  on  22  October  2008,
    however his application was refused on 12 March  2009.   He  lodged  an
    appeal on 30 March 2009, and his case was reconsidered.  On 22 November
    2010 he was granted leave until 22 February 2011.

7.   He applied for leave to remain as a Tier  4  (General)  Student  on  22
    February 2011, and was granted leave in this capacity on 23 April  2012
    until 23 August 2012.

8.   He applied for leave to remain as a Tier  4  (General)  Student  on  22
    August 2012, and was granted leave in this capacity on 20 November 2012
    until 30 January 2015.

9.   The appellant applied for leave outside the Rules on 20 February  2015.
      The  application  was  refused  on  29  May  2015.   He  requested  a
    reconsideration on 21 September 2015.  His case was  reconsidered,  and
    the refusal decision was upheld in a letter dated 1 December 2015.   He
    lodged an appeal on 4 February 2016; however, he withdrew his appeal on
    24 May 2016.

10.  On 1 June 2016 he applied for indefinite  leave  to  remain  under  ten
    years' long residency.  The application was  refused  on  20  September
    2016.  His appeal against this decision was  refused  by  FtTJ  Raymond
    under paragraph 276B and under Article 8 of the ECHR.

11.  The appellant was granted permission to appeal on the basis that  there
    is an arguable error of law in the judge's consideration of whether the
    appellant could benefit from  Section  3C  leave  and  thus  allow  the
    appellant to have resided lawfully in the UK for at least ten years. It
    follows from this that the judge's article 8 findings may be flawed.

12.  Mr Bandegani submitted that in the respondent's letter  of  1  December
    2015, detailing the appellant's immigration history, the  matters  that
    were being challenged by the appellant and the respondent's response to
    the matters raised by the appellant, the respondent did  not  say  that
    her decision on 29 May 2015 was withdrawn in a technical  sense.   This
    meant that the application made by the appellant on  20  February  2015
    remained unresolved.   The  appellant  wanted  reconsideration  of  the
    respondent's decision of 29 May 2015 and the Secretary of State refused
    to reconsider her decision.  It was  as  a  result  of  the  pre-action
    protocol letter indicating that the appellant  intended  to  apply  for
    judicial review that the Secretary of State decided to  reconsider  her
    decision.

13.  Mr Bandegani submitted that  as  a  result  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision of 29 May 2015 was not lawfully made because the Secretary  of
    State subsequently made  a  decision  on  27  January  2016  where  the
    Secretary of State  gave  notice  that  the  application  made  by  the
    appellant was not totally or clearly unfounded.  The Secretary of State
    had in response to the PAP letter agreed to review the claim which  she
    had accepted was not hopeless on any view.  Her decision on 27  January
    2016 carried an in-country right of appeal.   The  appellant  exercised
    his right of appeal and chose to withdraw it because by that  time  the
    appellant had accrued ten years' lawful residence for the  purposes  of
    paragraph 276B, having entered the UK lawfully on 16 May 2006.

14.  Mr Bandegani submitted that even  if  I  were  to  find  that  for  the
    purposes of the Immigration Rule there is not full satisfaction of  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, I would  have  to  consider  the
    judge's analysis of the appellant's Article 8 claim.  This  is  because
    the Secretary of State would have to demonstrate why it is not  legally
    right that this chronology gives satisfaction of Rule 276B  given  that
    there is no break  in  his  stay  and  that  materially  bears  on  the
    proportionality assessment which is a matter for the judge.

15.  Mr. Bandegani submitted that the judge went on a flight of  fancy  from
    paragraph 63 where he talks  about  the  certification  decision  under
    Section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  having
    been lawfully made when their argument was that the decision of 29  May
    2015 was not maintained and that Section 353 was not relied on  by  the
    Secretary of State.  Mr. Bandegani submitted that  the  judge  did  not
    properly confront the arguments  made  by  Mr  Biggs,  the  appellant's
    Counsel below.

16.  Mr Whitwell submitted that it is common ground  that  the  respondent's
    decision of 29 May 2015  was  not  formally  withdrawn.   He  said  the
    decision was a merits-based decision.   The  appellant  challenged  the
    decision because he was not given an in-country right of  appeal.   The
    PAP letter  dated  24  November  2015  did  not  take  issue  with  the
    respondent's decision on the merits.  It merely said that the appellant
    should have an in-country right of  appeal.   The  Secretary  of  State
    agreed and re-made the decision and upheld it.  So, the  argument  that
    the Secretary of State's decision was unlawful is not right.   So,  the
    judge's decision should be maintained.

17.  In reply, Mr Bandegani submitted that if the Section  94  decision  was
    lawful it would have been maintained otherwise the Secretary  of  State
    would have made a decision that it was not in accordance with the  law.
    She did not say that.

18.  He submitted there are two key decisions in  respect  of  the  decision
    dated 27 January 2016.  If the Secretary of State is  now  saying  that
    she was right to certify the claim, then why  did  she  choose  not  to
    certify it in January 2016.  He said we cannot segregate a merits-based
    assessment from the certificate because the certificate  bites  on  the
    merits.

Findings

19.  At the  heart  of  this  appeal  is  the  refusal  of  the  appellant's
    application for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of  ten  years'
    long residence.  He made the application on 1  June  2016  and  it  was
    refused on 20 September 2016.

20.  The respondent considered the application under paragraph 276B  of  the
    Immigration Rules which lays down the requirements that have to be  met
    by an applicant for indefinite leave to remain on  the  basis  of  long
    residence in the United Kingdom.  They are:

    (i)(a) he has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence in  the
    United Kingdom.


    (v) the applicant must not be in the UK in breach of immigration  laws,
    except that any period of overstaying for a period of 28 days  or  less
    be  disregarded  ...  and  any  period  of  overstaying   pending   the
    determination of an application made within that 28 day period

21.  The respondent noted that  in  light  of  the  appellant's  immigration
    history, that following the expiry of the refusal  of  his  application
    for leave outside the Rules on 29 May 2015, the appellant has  not  had
    valid leave in any capacity.  Although he applied for a reconsideration
    of this decision on 21 September 2015, this did not extend his leave by
    virtue of Section 3C and as such, he has not had valid leave since  the
    date of refusal.  The refusal  decision  was  upheld  and  he  was  not
    granted leave to remain.

22.  The respondent then says:

         "Therefore you were without lawful leave between 29  May  2015  and
         present, a period  of  over  28  days.   As  such  your  period  of
         continuous lawful residence is considered to have  been  broken  at
         this point.  With that in  mind,  you  have  not  demonstrated  ten
         years'  continuous  lawful  residence  and   cannot   satisfy   the
         requirement of paragraph 276B(i)(a) and (v)".

23.  The appellant challenged this decision.

24.  It is common ground between the parties that the respondent's  decision
    of 29 May 2015 was  not  formally  withdrawn.  It  was  a  merits-based
    decision, which was maintained upon reconsideration on 27 January 2016.
     The certification of the claim was withdrawn, and  the  appellant  was
    granted an in country  right  of  appeal.   On  4  February  2016,  the
    appellant exercised his right of appeal by lodging  an  appeal  against
    the refusal of the application that he made on 20  February  2015.   He
    withdrew his appeal on 24 May 2016.  On 1  June  2016  he  applied  for
    indefinite leave to remain under 10 years long residency.

25.  In the light of the above, I find that the judge's references  to  s.94
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and  paragraph  353
    of the Immigrations Rules at paragraphs 62 to 66 had  no  relevance  to
    the issue that was before him.

26.  I understood Mr. Bandegani's submission to  mean  that  by  27  January
    2016 when the respondent finally made a  decision  on  the  appellant's
    application of 20 February 2015, the appellant had  accrued  10  years'
    lawful residence for the purposes of paragraph 276B, having entered the
    UK lawfully on 16 May 2006.  Mr. Bandegani did not make  any  reference
    at  all  to  s.3C  leave.    The  grounds  argued  that  in   all   the
    circumstances the appellant was entitled to reside in the UK given that
    he was entitled to reside in the UK until  his  appeal  was  determined
    (s.78 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002).   It  was
    argued that the judge failed to engage with this argument and proceeded
    on the basis that  the  appellant's  case  would  be  answered  if  the
    appellant did not have leave by virtue of s.3C of the 1971 Act  despite
    it having been expressly conceded that the appellant did not have leave
    to remain after 31 January 2015.

27.  I find that if it was expressly conceded that  the  appellant  did  not
    have leave to remain after 31 January 2015,  then  it  means  that  the
    appellant could not meet all the requirements of  paragraph  276B.   He
    may have met the requirement of 10 years continuous  residence  because
    the period of 28 days overstay is disregarded by virtue of subparagraph
    (iv) but that does not mean that all of the10 years' were "lawful" .

28.  The judge said at paragraph 61 "that after the refusal on 29  May  2015
    of his application outside the Rules made on 20 February 2015 at a time
    when he had overstayed some twenty days after  expiry  of  his  Tier  4
    Student leave on 30 January 2015 and which can be ignored under Section
    276B(v), the appellant did not have 3C leave because it was  considered
    that his private life application outside of the Rules  was  unfounded,
    being therefore as a result certified on that basis under Section 94(1)
    of the 2002 Act, with effect that his right of  appeal  could  only  be
    exercised outside the UK."

29.  I find that the judge misunderstood the respondent's decision.

30.  In order for Section 3C of the  Immigration  Act  1971  to  operate,  a
    person who has limited leave to enter or remain in the UK and wishes to
    apply for variation of that leave, has  to  make  the  application  for
    variation before his leave expires.  Section 3C  will  then  come  into
    operation  by  extending  leave  if  the  leave  expires  without   the
    application for variation having been decided or withdrawn.

31.  In this case the appellant's leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student which was granted on 20 November 2012  expired  on  30  January
    2015.  The appellant's application for  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Rules was not made before his leave expired on 30 January 2015.  It was
    made on 20 February 2015 at a time when he did not have existing  leave
    to remain in the UK. Consequently, he did not have  the  protection  of
    s3C leave.  Accordingly, I accept  the  decision  in  the  respondent's
    reasons for refusal letter that although he applied for reconsideration
    of the decision on 21 September 2015, this did not extend his leave  by
    virtue of Section 3C and as such he has not had valid leave  since  the
    date of refusal, the refusal date being 29 May 2015.  Therefore, I find
    that the arguments about the certification of the decision  of  29  May
    2015 and the removal of the certificate following  reconsideration  are
    of no relevance to this appeal.

32.  So, whilst the  judge  was  wrong  to  consider  the  certification  or
    otherwise of the respondent's decision, I find that  his  dismissal  of
    the  appellant's  appeal  should  stand.   This  is  because  when  the
    appellant made the application for leave to  remain  under  ten  years'
    long residence on 1 June 2016 it was out of time,  because  his  lawful
    leave had expired on 30 January 2015 which meant that he did  not  have
    ten years' lawful residence in the UK.

33.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
