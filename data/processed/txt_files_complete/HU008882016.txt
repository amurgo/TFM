For the Appellant:     Mr I Palmer, of Counsel instructed by Messrs BWF
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, a citizen of Ghana born on 10 April 1978  appeals,  with
    permission, against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Heynes who in a determination promulgated on 24 June 2016 dismissed the
    appellant's appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State made on
    18 December 2015 to refuse a human rights application, that application
    having followed a decision  to  make  a  deportation  order  under  the
    provisions of Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act  2007  dated  9  July
    2015.  The deportation order was made on 18 December 2015.

2.   The appellant claimed to have arrived in Britain in 2003 as a  visitor.
     She overstayed.  She was encountered by the police  in  May  2007  and
    detained and the day following was convicted at Cardiff Crown Court  of
    using a  false  instrument,  making  a  false  statement  to  obtain  a
    passport, possessing  an  improperly  obtained  identity  document  and
    failing to surrender to custody.  She received a suspended sentence  of
    twelve  months'  imprisonment.   She  was  transferred  to  immigration
    detention on 7 June 2007 but was then granted temporary release subject
    to restrictions but failed to report and was noted as an absconder.

3.   On 17 February 2009 she was  convicted  at  Southwark  Crown  Court  of
    dishonestly making false representation to make gain for herself and of
    fraud by abuse of  her  position  and  sentenced  to  eighteen  months'
    imprisonment.

4.   On 12 September 2009 a notice of  liability  to  automatic  deportation
    was served on her.  She made no response.  She was released on bail  on
    14 September 2009 but again failed to comply with reporting  conditions
    after March 2010.  On 2 August 2011 a notice of liability to  automatic
    deportation dispatched to her last known address  was  returned  marked
    "addressee unknown".  In October that year her previous representatives
    confirmed they no longer acted for her.  Nothing  was  heard  from  her
    until 4 December 2013 when she made an application for leave to  remain
    which was treated as an application to revoke  the  deportation  order.
    That was refused in March 2014 and the appellant appealed.  Her  appeal
    was successful in the First-tier but when it came before Judge  of  the
    Upper Tribunal Coker on 7 January 2015 the appeal was remitted  to  the
    First-tier on the basis that the First-tier Judge who had  allowed  the
    appeal had not made clear findings on why it would be unduly harsh  for
    the appellant's  daughter,  Kayleigh  Noelle  Quansima  Blankson-Mensah
    who was born on 16 December 2008 while the appellant was in prison,  to
    go to Ghana with her.  Upper Tribunal Judge Coker stated that the judge
    had not taken into account the  sentencing  remarks  of  the  judge  in
    relation to the conviction for  fraud,  the  fact  that  the  appellant
    denied the offence and continued to do so  despite  having  been  found
    guilty and  that  the  judge  had  not  properly  considered  the  best
    interests of the appellant's child, which should be  considered  within
    the context of the offences committed by the appellant. At  the  appeal
    before Judge  Heynes  the  appellant  asserted  that  she  had  married
    Kayleigh's father, Omar Ghan Herbert-Blankson,  a  British  citizen  in
    Ghana in 2002.  It was the appellant's evidence that  her  relationship
    with Mr Herbert-Blankson had broken up in December 2014 or January 2015
    and at the time of the appeal she said she has been in  a  relationship
    with a Mr Apauh since January 2015 and they had a daughter,  Anne-Marie
    Apauh-Sarpong born in April 2016.

5.   Although Mr Apauh gave evidence at the appellant's appeal before  Judge
    Heynes, that relationship appears to have broken down and  no  reliance
    on that relationship was put forward on behalf of the appellant  before
    me.  I note that Judge Heynes found the evidence of Mr Apauh before him
    was not credible, firstly because on Anne-Marie's birth certificate  it
    was stated that he had been born in France when that was not true -  he
    was born in Ghana - and secondly because he had difficulty  in  stating
    what Kayleigh's family name was.  I note that in earlier statements the
    appellant had claimed to be in a durable relationship with another  man
    but that relationship too no longer subsists.

6.   Judge Heynes correctly stated that the issue of this appeal related  to
    Section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and in
    particular the Article 8 considerations  involving  foreign  criminals.
    He stated that the circumstances of  this  appeal  suggested  that  the
    public interest in deportation was  "profound".   He  referred  to  the
    appellant's criminal history and the fact  that  she  had  fraudulently
    obtained ï¿½75,000 from her employer  over  45  false  transactions.   He
    noted that she had only pleaded guilty when put under pressure  by  the
    police and referred to the fact that  she  had  been  found  guilty  of
    offences in both  2007  and  2009  which  showed,  in  his  opinion,  a
    continuing propensity to deceive.

7.   He referred to  the  provisions  of  Section  117C(5)  which  he  noted
    providing exceptions for an  appellant who could show that  she  had  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner or  child
    and the effect of her deportation with that partner or child  would  be
    unduly harsh.  He noted that Kayleigh was a qualifying child as she was
    British and indeed that she had lived in Britain for  more  than  seven
    years.  He stated that it was clearly in Kayleigh's best interests that
    she remained with her mother and then considered whether or  not  there
    would be undue harshness in expecting Kayleigh to go to Ghana with  her
    mother.

8.   In paragraph 49 he accepted  that  Kayleigh's  best  interests  lay  in
    remaining with her mother and in the following  paragraph  he  accepted
    that Kayleigh would experience disruption from her  schooling  and  her
    friends in going with her mother to Ghana, but he  stated  that  by  no
    sensible interpretation could those circumstances be described as harsh
    as she would go to school in Ghana as her educated mother had done  and
    she would be able to make new friends.  He stated  that  the  appellant
    had qualifications and experience that she could put to good use.

9.   He referred to the  judgment  of  the  European  Court  of  Justice  in
    Zambrano stating that it did not impose a complete bar on a EU national
    being expected to travel to her parent's country when  that  parent  is
    deported.  He clearly bore in mind Regulation 21(a) of the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006 which had been inserted after  the  promulgation
    of the determination in Sanade [2012]  UKUT  00048  (IAC).   Regulation
    21(a) provides that a person who would  ordinarily  have  a  derivative
    right of residence pursuant to Zambrano  could  be  denied  that  right
    where deportation be "conducive  to  the  public  good".   It  was  the
    argument for the Secretary of State in the letter of refusal  that  the
    enhanced levels of protection were enjoyed by those rights  established
    under  the  Free  Movement  Directive  as  implemented  by   the   2006
    Regulations but did not apply to derivative rights of residence enjoyed
    pursuant to the decision in Zambrano (case C-34/09).

10.  Judge Heynes therefore went on to dismiss the appeal.

11.  The appellant appealed arguing that the judge should  have  taken  into
    account the fact that the appellant had been free  from  detention  for
    nearly seven years and therefore was wrong to  state  that  she  had  a
    continuing propensity to deceive.   It  was  argued  that  that  was  a
    material error of law.  Moreover it  was  argued  that  the  judge  had
    incorrectly interpreted the  provisions  of  Section  117C(5),  as  the
    appellant had a qualifying child here and it was asserted that it would
    be unduly harsh for that child, Kayleigh, to go with the  appellant  to
    Ghana.

12.  It was further argued that the judge  had  ignored  a  social  worker's
    report which has stated that  the  parental  relationship  between  the
    appellant  and  Kayleigh  was  extremely  strong  and  also  that   the
    provisions of Section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration
    Act 2009 had also been ignored.  It was asserted  that  the  judge  had
    placed weight on the appellant's relationship with  Mr  Apau  a  French
    national but ignored the broader evidence relating to  the  appellant's
    child which was that she was a British citizen.

13.  At the hearing of the appeal before me Mr Palmer relied on the  grounds
    of appeal. He acknowledged the persuasiveness of the  judgment  of  the
    Court of Appeal in MM (Uganda) [2016] EWCA Civ 617.  He stated that the
    judge had not properly addressed the issue  of  what  was  or  was  not
    unduly harsh.  He argued that the judge's consideration of  that  issue
    was wholly inappropriate and indeed ignored  the  directions  of  Judge
    Coker when she had remitted the appeal to the First-tier.  He argued it
    was  again  in  the  best  interests  of  Kayleigh  to   remain.    All
    circumstances, he argued, had  not  been  property  considered  by  the
    judge.

14.  In reply Mr Bramble argued that the judge had considered  all  relevant
    matters and that his conclusions were adequate -  brevity  was  not  an
    error.  He referred to the  documentary  evidence  and  to  the  Social
    Service's report and stated that the  judge  had  considered  the  best
    interests of Kayleigh but had noted that she had no  relationship  with
    her biological father.  The judge had dealt properly with the issue  of
    schooling,  school  friends  and  the  appellant's  relationship   with
    Kayleigh.  He  had  also  considered  the  fact  that  the  appellant's
    daughter was a British citizen.

15.  In reply Mr Palmer stated it was not the case the judge had  considered
    all factors and therefore the determination should be set aside.

Discussion

16.  The principal plank of the arguments  put  forward  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant  were  that  the  First-tier  Judge  had  not  properly,   or
    sufficiently thoroughly,  considered the issue of whether  or  not  the
    fact that Kayleigh, a British subject, would have to go to  Ghana  with
    the appellant and it would be unduly harsh for Kayleigh to live in  the
    country to which her mother was to be deported.  In  particular  it  is
    argued that the judge had not considered  the  social  worker's  report
    relating to Kayleigh's welfare nor had he taken into account Section 55
    of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

17.   It is correct that the judge's consideration of the  issue  of   undue
    hardship  in paragraphs 49 onwards is brief.  However, the  reality  is
    that there was nothing in the evidence put forward that would  indicate
    that the removal of Kayleigh would be  unduly  harsh.   There  is  very
    considerable documentary evidence that she  is  progressing  at  school
    here and indeed there is evidence relating to education in Ghana.   The
    Social  worker's  report  deals  in   detail   with   the   appellant's
    relationship with Kayleigh and the overall impression given is that the
    relationship between Kayleigh and the appellant  is  strong,  that  the
    appellant acts in Kayleigh's best interests and is  a  good  mother  to
    her.  It is also of note that the appellant's own  schooling  in  Ghana
    led to her having achieved both O  and  A-levels  there  and  that  she
    proceeded to university in Ghana.

17.  The reality is that there was nothing in the social worker's report  or
    in any other of the documentary evidence that indicated that  it  would
    be unduly harsh for Kayleigh to relocate with her mother to Ghana.   In
    paragraphs 49 and 50 the judge properly considered the issue  of  undue
    harshness and was entitled to conclude that Kayleigh would go to school
    in Ghana and be able to make new friends there and that  the  appellant
    would have qualifications and experience which she could  put  to  good
    use.  There was nothing moreover in the background  evidence  submitted
    with the bundle of documents that indicated that  Kayleigh  would  face
    ill-treatment or a lack of education in Ghana.  She would of course  be
    with her mother and the overwhelming evidence is that her mother  would
    look after her best interests and would be a good and supportive mother
    to her wherever she was.

18.  I therefore conclude that the judge made no material error  of  law  in
    his conclusion that for Kayleigh to go with her mother to  Ghana  would
    not be unduly harsh.

19.  Mr Palmer correctly referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal  in
    MM (Uganda).  It is clear, when  considering  that  judgment  that  the
    issue of the rights  of  Kayleigh  and  whether  or  not  it  would  be
    proportionate for her to be expected to return to Ghana with her mother
    must be viewed in the context  of  the  appellant's  deportation  which
    followed her committal of serious criminal offences.

20.  I note the serious nature of  the  index  offence  and  the  sentencing
    remarks of His Honour Judge Price who pointed out  that  the  appellant
    had a position of high trust  where  she  was  charged  with  assessing
    medical claims and that she engaged  in  dishonest  transactions  which
    cost her employer ï¿½74,000 or ï¿½75,000.   Judge Price said that  she  had
    committed a "reasonably  complex  fraud"  and  that  she  had  done  it
    cleverly.  She had only been caught when she phoned  in  when  she  was
    supposedly off sick pretending to be a claimant.

21.  It is also of note that the notice of  liability  to  automatic  deport
    followed the sentence relatively quickly but that when released on bail
    the appellant failed to comply with reporting conditions and  that  the
    deportation order itself was obtained in August 2013, the  delay  being
    further caused because by the fact that the appellant had not  complied
    with reporting conditions.  a further notice of liability to  automatic
    deportation had been served the  appellant  but.  was  returned  marked
    "addressee unknown" and another had been forwarded by  the  appellant's
    solicitors to her and there had been no response.   The  argument  that
    the appellant had not committed a crime for some years  and  that  that
    should be taken  into  account  is  simply  irrelevant  when  what  has
    happened is that the respondent has tried to obtain a response from the
    appellant to the notice of intention to deport but that  the  appellant
    had not replied.  I would add that moreover this is  an  appellant  who
    entered Britain as a visitor and then overstayed.  The public  interest
    is overwhelmingly in favour of the deportation of  this  appellant  who
    had no leave to remain in Britain and has committed a serious crime.

22.  No reference was made to the appellant's second child who was  born  in
    April this year, is not British and would be going to  Ghana  with  her
    mother.  There is nothing to indicate that it would not be in her  best
    interests to do so - the appellant's  relationship  with  that  child's
    father has broken down.

23.  In these circumstances I find that there was no material error  of  law
    in the determination of the First-tier  Judge  and  that  his  decision
    dismissing this deportation appeal should stand.
