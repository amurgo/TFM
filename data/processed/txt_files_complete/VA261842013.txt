For the Appellant:     No representative
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 26th March 1974.
    He applied for entry clearance to visit  the  United  Kingdom  for  two
    months. His brother-in-law was his Sponsor.

 2. On 19th June 2012, the Entry Clearance Officer refused the  application
    on the basis that he was not satisfied that the Appellant was a genuine
    visitor and was someone who would leave the United Kingdom at  the  end
    of his visit.

 3. Whilst the Entry Clearance Officer was satisfied that  the  UK  Sponsor
    would be responsible for  the  maintenance  and  accommodation  of  the
    Appellant, he was not satisfied of  the  Appellant's  claimed  personal
    circumstances. Consequently he was not satisfied that the Appellant had
    accurately reflected his circumstances in Pakistan and thus refused the
    application under paragraph 41(i)(ii), of the Immigration Rules.

 4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. In  determining  the
    appeal, Judge Carroll in a determination promulgated on 1st March  2013
    dismissed the appeal. She was not satisfied on the evidence before  her
    (including that of the Sponsor) that the Appellant met the requirements
    of paragraph 41.

 5. On 26th April 2013 First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Nicholson  granted  the
    Appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. Thus  the  appeal
    came before me.

 6. At the hearing Mr Avery appeared on behalf of the  Respondent.  No  one
    attended or appeared on behalf of the Appellant. The Appellant  himself
    is obviously living abroad and his nominated representatives  are  also
    in Pakistan. His Sponsor was served with notice  of  the  hearing,  but
    nevertheless did not attend. In all the circumstances I  was  satisfied
    that the Appellant had been notified of the hearing and that it was  in
    the interests of justice to proceed.

 7. Mr Avery on behalf of the Respondent submitted that a  Rule  24  Notice
    had been  served  and  the  lines  of  his  submission  followed  those
    contained in the Rule 24 Notice.

 8. I begin with the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  reasons.  They  were  as
    follows:

         "You have said that your  Sponsor  will  be  responsible  for  your
         maintenance and accommodation. From the  supporting  documents  you
         have submitted, I am satisfied that they  are  able  to  meet  this
         responsibility. However whilst I am satisfied of this, I still have
         to be satisfied of your own personal and financial circumstances in
         Pakistan and your intention to leave the UK upon completion of your
         proposed visit. You have said that you work as  an  agriculturalist
         earning Rs 25,000 (ï¿½174) per month. However you  have  provided  no
         documentation to support these statements. You have submitted  your
         bank statement however there is no evidence to show where the money
         has  come  from.  As  a  result,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  your
         circumstances are as you have set out or that  the  bank  statement
         presented is an accurate reflection  of  your  financial  position.
         Given  the  lack   of   documentation   provided   regarding   your
         circumstances in Pakistan, I  consider  that  there  is  little  to
         encourage you to leave on completion of your  visit.  All  of  this
         means that, on the balance of probabilities,  I  am  not  satisfied
         that you have accurately presented your circumstances or intentions
         in wishing to visit the UK now".

 9. On appeal Judge Carroll was satisfied (after hearing evidence from  the
    Sponsor) that the Appellant is a farmer as claimed and  that  he  sells
    both milk and animals. However the Judge was not  satisfied  about  the
    amount of income that the Appellant was putting forward. In paragraph 6
    of her determination she states,

         "The  evidence  to  support  the  Appellant's  claimed  income  is,
         however, to say the least scant".

    She records that there was no evidence to show the origin of the  funds
    deposited  in  the  Appellant's  bank  account  and  that  no   further
    information was submitted with the grounds of appeal.

10. Permission to appeal was granted in this case  because  the  Judge  was
    unable to assess a receipt referred to  as  "a  sole  cattle  receipt".
    Permission was granted on the basis that the  Judge  appeared  to  have
    overlooked the translated receipt in the original bundle for  the  sale
    of a goat numbered 39 in the top right-hand corner. In fact that  error
    makes little difference to the overall assessment of this appeal.

11. The Judge has noted and accepted that the  Appellant  is  a  farmer  as
    claimed and that he sells both milk and animals. What she was concerned
    about was the lack of documentation to substantiate any  of  this.  One
    receipt of the sale of a goat cannot be said to alleviate that concern.

12. The Judge was not satisfied looking at the evidence as a whole  and  on
    the basis of the evidence I find that the Judge was  entitled  to  find
    that the  Appellant  had  failed  to  establish  his  circumstances  in
    Pakistan and therefore that he was a genuine visitor  who  intended  to
    leave at the end of the visit. For these reasons the Judge did not  err
    in law in dismissing the  Appellant's  appeal  under  paragraph  41  in
    particular that he had not met the requirements of paragraphs 41(i) and
    41(ii).

DECISION

13. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss  the  Appellant's  appeal
    under paragraph 41 of the Rules did not involve the making of an  error
    of law and its decision stands.

14. For these reasons, the Appellant's appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made
