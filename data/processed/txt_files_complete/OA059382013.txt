                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Egypt born  on  6th  October  1991.   The
    Appellant applied for admission to the  United  Kingdom  by  virtue  of
    European Community law as the family member of a European Economic Area
    national who is exercising, or  wishes  to  exercise,  rights  of  free
    movement under the Treaty of Rome in the United Kingdom.  The Secretary
    of State noted that the Appellant had provided evidence that his  uncle
    had been granted an EEA family permit in the United Kingdom and  stated
    that his father was deceased and that his uncle provided him with funds
    on a regular basis.  However, it was also noted that the Appellant  had
    stated that he was a student, that he lived with his mother and sister,
    and that his grandfather lives in the same village.  The  Appellant  is
    no longer a minor.  The Secretary of State concluded that the Appellant
    had not provided evidence to show that he was dependent upon his uncle,
    nor was he satisfied that he was dependent on  an  EEA  national  or  a
    member of his/her household, and therefore was not an  extended  family
    member in accordance with Regulation 8  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  The Secretary of State issued  Notice
    of Refusal on 5th February 2013.

 2. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Moore sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  21st  August  2013.   In  a
    determination promulgated on 6th September 2013 the Appellant's appeal
    was dismissed.

 3. On 13th September 2013 the Appellant lodged Grounds of  Appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  On  27th  September  2013  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Mailer  granted  permission  to  appeal.   Judge   Mailer   noted   the
    Respondent's decision to refuse his application for a permit and  noted
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge was not satisfied that the Appellant
    had been sent regular monies as claimed by either his uncle or the  EEA
    national, the uncle's  wife.   He  was  thus  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant was dependent on the EEA national or his uncle.   The  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge had found at  paragraph  20  of  his  determination
    various credit payments had been made into the Appellant's account  for
    the period 30th October 2012 to 11th February 2013 but on the evidence
    before  him,  he  was  not  satisfied  "precisely  who  had  made  such
    payments".  He noted that the EEA national had  claimed  to  have  made
    regular payments to him,  but  that  there  was  no  reliable  evidence
    corroborating that and the only record  of  any  such  payments  was  a
    document showing that on 14th November 2012 the sum of �2,000 was paid
    into the Appellant's account.

 4. Judge Mailer noted that the grounds  submitted  that  the  findings  at
    paragraph 20 were wrong, and that  the  payments  were  made  from  the
    uncle's account which were contained in  the  bundle  produced  by  the
    Respondent's embassy visa section.   Further,  he  noted  that  it  was
    contended that the uncle could have  explained  the  position  had  the
    judge requested evidence of who made  the  payments  and  that  it  was
    submitted that the judge should in any event  have  accepted  that  the
    money sent in by the Appellant's aunt-in-law was at the time he applied
    to join the Union, a citizen on whom he was dependent.  The judge  made
    a conclusion that it was arguable that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    had failed to have proper regard to the evidence  available  which  may
    have resulted in incorrect findings at paragraphs  20  and  24  of  the
    determination.

 5. On 14th October 2013 the Secretary of State served a Rule 24  response.
    That response is merely a  holding  document  on  the  basis  that  the
    Secretary of State did not have the  determination  and  therefore  was
    unable effectively to comment.

 6. On 19th November 2013 the matter came before me to determine whether or
    not there was a material error of law in the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal.  I found that there was and that the  appeal  turned  on  the
    ability of the Appellant to show that he is dependent  upon  his  uncle
    and his wife and for a legal analysis of  what  constitutes  dependency
    and whether such analysis once defined is  met  and  sustained  by  the
    evidence produced within bank statements.  I found that  it  was  clear
    (and this was accepted by both legal representatives present before me)
    that the reference at paragraph 20 of  the  determination  to  payments
    varying between �1,500 and �3,985 was wrong and that the  amounts  made
    actually varied between �200  and  �4,999.   In  such  circumstances  I
    accepted that it was possible that the judge had made a wrong  analysis
    in fact as to the payments that had been made and for their purpose and
    that as a matter of fairness it was correct to find that there had been
    a material error of law in the determination of the First-tier Tribunal
    and to set aside that  decision  on  the  basis  that  the  only  issue
    outstanding was  that  set  out  within  those  findings  and  to  give
    directions for the rehearing of the matter.

 7. Consequently directions were sent out by the administration,  recording
    that the issue outstanding in  this  matter  was  whether  or  not  the
    Appellant was dependent upon his uncle and aunt as set  out  within  my
    finding as to an error of law and it is on that basis that  the  appeal
    comes back before me.  The Appellant has, pursuant  to  the  directions
    that I gave, lodged an up-to-date bundle of documents, all of  which  I
    have considered.  In particular they relate to bank transfers and there
    are copies of bank statements.  The Appellant appears by his instructed
    Counsel Miss Anifowghe and the Appellant's Sponsor Mr Mohamed Badwy  is
    also in attendance.  The Secretary of State appears by her Home  Office
    Presenting Officer Mr Harrison.

Evidence

 8. Mr Badwy attended and gave evidence.  I was taken to  the  confirmation
    of transfers from the National Westminster Bank to be found at pages 13
    to 17 of the additional bundle and that those payments were made by the
    Sponsor to the Appellant via the National Bank of Egypt.

 9. Mr Harrison cross-examined the Sponsor  with  regard  to  his  business
    activities and payments made.  Mr Harrison started  by  noting  to  the
    Sponsor that at page 19 of his bundle he had produced three  pay  slips
    from Marios Takeaway (Blackpool)  Limited  covering  the  periods  10th
    February 2013 to 24th February 2013, all showing that the Sponsor's net
    weekly pay amounted to �142.37.  Mr Badwy  confirmed  they  represented
    his net income from Marios Takeaway but that he left  Marios  in  March
    2013 and set up his own business with his wife entitled Hot  Stuff.   I
    am referred to the letter from his accounting services confirming this.
     Mr Badwy's business is not it appears a limited company,  i.e.  he  is
    self-employed  trading  as  Hot  Stuff  which   I understand   is   a
    restaurant/takeaway business and that he has now traded for a year  and
    he states that he earns a net profit of some  �12,000  to  �15,000  per
    annum although no accounts are available to me to confirm or deny these
    figures.  He further confirms that  his  wife  continues  to  work  for
    Marios Takeaway earning �144 per week.  No information is provided, nor
    suggestion made, of Mr Badwy or his wife having any  additional  income
    over and above the figures quoted herein.

10. Mr Badwy confirmed to Mr Harrison that not only did he have a nephew in
    Egypt but he also had a niece who was a student aged 15  and  that  she
    does not have to pay for her education, only for her books.  He further
    confirmed that the five payments made represent all the  payments  that
    he had made to his nephew in the past twelve months.   When  questioned
    as to how he can afford to make such payments Mr Badwy states  that  he
    has put the money aside each week and that the money was to  cover  the
    Appellant's rent, house refurbishment and college expenses.

11. The Appellant's wife Miss Garcia also attended and gave evidence.  Miss
    Garcia advised that she is still working a sixteen  hour  week  earning
    around �100 per week.  Mr  Harrison  takes  Miss  Garcia  to  the  bank
    statements exhibited at page 11 and 12 of the bundle, pointing out  six
    pay slips had been provided all showing a net income of �100 per  week.
    She confirms that she only has part-time earnings and that she also has
    a 2 year old child to support.  It is put to her  that  a  lot  of  her
    income is apparently going to Egypt to support the Sponsor's nephew and
    she confirms this and when asked as to how she feels about  it,  merely
    states the Appellant is in Egypt and needs help.  She acknowledges that
    the Appellant's connection to  her  is  solely  through  her  husband's
    family.  She further confirms that she would support his  move  to  the
    United Kingdom and that if he came here he would help her and her child
    and that he would work.  She confirmed that no other relatives  of  the
    Sponsor are supported in Egypt.  When it is put to her as  to  how  the
    Appellant's other family members are supported,  bearing  in  mind  the
    Appellant's mother does not work, she merely replies that she does  not
    know this nor does she know whether or not it is the intention  of  the
    Appellant's sister to go on in later life to university.

Submissions/Discussions

12. Mr Harrison relies on the Notice of Refusal of 5th  February  2013  and
    the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  review  of  10th   June   2013.    He
    acknowledges an explanation has been provided of the financial evidence
    and the paper trail of transactions through bank  accounts  and  whilst
    concerned that some of it is out of date because it has been superseded
    by twelve months of trading by the Sponsor in  his  new  business.   He
    acknowledges that no documentation relating to that business  has  been
    provided.  However he  challenges  whether  or  not  the  bank  account
    transactions show dependency on behalf of  the  Appellant  and  submits
    that they do not.  He asked me to refuse the application.

13. Counsel on behalf of the Appellant submits that there has been evidence
    produced to show some form of dependency prior to the  application  and
    his Sponsors have shown that the  dependency  continues.   She  submits
    that evidence has been produced to show that  money  to  care  for  the
    Appellant's  living  expenses  is  being  provided  and  contends  that
    dependency has been shown that the payment of �4,999 was to set up  the
    Appellant and pay his rent in advance  and  that  payments  of  smaller
    amounts are provisions providing his allowance.  She submits  that  his
    dependency and that the terms of Regulation 8 of the  2006  Regulations
    are met.

Findings

14. It is the contention of the Appellant's Counsel that the  Appellant  is
    financially dependent upon his Spanish aunt-in-law Miss Garcia and  his
    uncle the Sponsor and relying  on  Rahman  C-83/11  submits  that  this
    dependency existed when he applied to join them in the United  Kingdom.
    It is clear that there has been a paper  trail  showing  that  payments
    have been made, including one particularly substantial amount  of  just
    under �5,000 to the Appellant by the Sponsor and Miss  Garcia.   It  is
    difficult to establish the paper trail as to how that money  came  into
    their accounts, but they  stipulate  that  this  was  through  savings,
    albeit it is hard for the Tribunal to understand how a couple with very
    limited income, a 2 year old son to support and a new business to  fund
    are able to  provide  the  financial  support  to  send  money  to  the
    Appellant.  The fact remains that payments have been made.

15. The witness statements relied upon are those provided to the First-tier
    Tribunal and I gave  specific  directions  evidence  was  to  be  made
    available at rehearing to show there was dependency.  That evidence has
    not been provided.  What has been provided is an updated bundle showing
    the specific bank transfers that have been made,  a  copy  of  a  lease
    dating back to 2011 and a purported declaration from the Appellant that
    he is dependent upon the Sponsor.  I do  no  more  than  consider  that
    document in the round.  Whilst explanations have been given as  to  the
    payments made, there is still no reliable or credible  evidence  before
    me to demonstrate the claim that there is dependence by the  Appellant,
    at the very least at the time when the Appellant applied  to  join  the
    Sponsor in the UK.  The conclusions reached  at  paragraph  24  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge are in fact  ultimately,  even  allowing  the
    Appellant  the  opportunity  to   revisit   this   matter,   completely
    justifiable and ones in which the First-tier Tribunal Judge appears  to
    have been entitled to reach.  She found that the Appellant's uncle  and
    his wife have at some time during the previous two years sent monies to
    the Appellant.  However neither she nor I are  satisfied  that  regular
    monies have been sent as claimed  or  he  is  dependent  upon  the  EEA
    national or indeed his  uncle.   All  that  has  been  provided  is  an
    explanation clarifying the figures and the amount sent.  That does  not
    go  to  the  nub  of  this  matter,   namely   dependence.    In   such
    circumstances, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities  that
    he meets the  requirements  of  Regulation  8,  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 and the Appellant's appeal is dismissed.

Decision

16. The appeal under the EEA Regulations 2006 is dismissed and the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal is maintained.

17. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.   No
    application is made to vary that order and none is made.
