Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Howard, instructed by Fountain Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. I have made this decision following a  resumed  hearing  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal at Stoke on Trent on 21 June 2017.  I found  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal had erred in law such that the decision fell  to  be  set
    aside.  My error of law decision is dated 13  March 2017 and  reads  as
    follows:

         "1.  The appellant, MD, was born in 1989 and is a male  citizen  of
         Iran.  He claimed asylum in the United Kingdom but  his  claim  was
         rejected by a decision of the respondent dated 29 March  2016.   He
         appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge O'Rourke)  which,  in  a
         decision promulgated on 26 September 2016,  dismissed  the  appeal.
         The appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper  Tribunal.



         2.   Granting permission in  the  Upper  Tribunal,  Judge  Lindsley
         found that it was arguable that

         The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  consider  material   and   the
         submissions put forward by the appellant  ...  that  the  appellant
         would be at risk on return  as  a  Kurdish  failed  asylum  seeker.
         Likewise it is clearly the case that the skeleton argument  made  a
         case that the applicant was entitled  to  succeed  under  paragraph
         276ADE of the Immigration Rules so it was  arguably  inaccurate  to
         say at paragraph 28 of the decision that no submissions  were  made
         regarding the appellant's private life ....

         3.   In a Rule 24 response, which is dated 20  December  2016,  the
         Secretary of State indicates that she does not oppose  the  appeal.
         Further, Judge Lindsley refused permission on the ground of  appeal
         challenging the judge's finding that the appellant would  not  face
         persecution on return as a failed asylum seeker  or  on  the  basis
         that he illegally exited Iran.  Likewise permission was not granted
         in respect of the appellant's sur place activities  in  the  United
         Kingdom (which had been found by the judge not to expose him to the
         likelihood of real risk on return to Iran). In  consequence,  those
         sur place activities and circumstances in which the appellant  came
         to leave Iran shall not be revisited at  the  resumed  hearing  nor
         will the judge's findings at [24]  that  the  appellant  is  not  a
         member of the KDPI and the judge's findings that the appellant  had
         given an untruthful account  of  past  events  in  Iran.   For  the
         avoidance of any doubt, those findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge shall stand and the Upper Tribunal  at  the  resumed  hearing
         will only consider (i) whether the appellant would be at real  risk
         on return to Iran as  a  Kurdish  failed  asylum  seeker  and  (ii)
         whether the appellant  is  entitled  to  a  grant  of  leave  under
         paragraph 276ADE of HC 395 (as amended).

         Notice of Decision

         4.   The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  on  26
         September 2016 is set aside.  I have  indicated  at  paragraph  [3]
         above those findings of the First-tier Tribunal shall  which  stand
         and which shall not.  The  decision  will  be  remade  following  a
         resumed hearing at Stoke-on-Trent before Upper Tribunal Judge Clive
         Lane on a date to be fixed.  At that hearing,  the  Tribunal  shall
         only consider the matters detailed in paragraph [3] above."

 2. I did not hear evidence from the appellant at the resumed hearing which
    proceeded by way of submissions only.  I reserved my decision following
    the hearing.

 3. The only issues which remain to be determined by the Upper Tribunal are
    those set out in my error of law decision at [3],  namely  (i)  whether
    the appellant would be at risk on return to Iran as  a  Kurdish  failed
    asylum and (ii) whether the appellant is entitled to a grant  of  leave
    under paragraph 276ADE of HC 395 (as amended).  As regards  the  second
    issue, Mr Howard submitted that this fell entirely within the ambit  of
    the asylum/Article 3 ECHR appeal; he submitted that there was little to
    add beyond the submission that the appellant  would  face  "significant
    obstacles" to his reintegration in Iran for  the  reasons  advanced  in
    support of his asylum protection claim.

 4. In terms of  evidence,  there  had  been  two  developments  since  the
    previous hearing.  First, the Tribunal has  the  benefit  of  a  report
    prepared by Dr Emil Joff� who is currently a lecturer in the Department
    of Politics and International Studies at the University  of  Cambridge.
    Secondly, the appellant produced a "certificate" which purports to have
    been issued by the Democratic Party of Iranian  Kurdistan  (KDPI)  from
    its Paris office on 12 March 2017 which "certifies that [the appellant]
    is a member of our party and that, because of the oppression  exercised
    by the Islamic Republic of Iran against him, he is restrained to  leave
    Iran.  If he is returned to the  country  it  would  put  his  life  in
    danger."  This item of evidence is in stark  contrast  to  the  finding
    (which has been preserved - see my error of law decision  [3])  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal that the appellant is not a member of the  KDPI  as
    he claimed.  Considering the certificate in the light of  the  previous
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal I agree with Mr  Bates'  submission
    that the certificate, whilst it may indicate  that  the  appellant  had
    become a member of the KDPI, he has done so since the  promulgation  of
    the error of law decision and entirely cynically, that is with  a  view
    to bolstering his asylum claim.

 5. In the light of that finding, I have considered the submission made  by
    Mr Howard relying upon the authority of HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31).   Mr
    Howard submitted that it would be likely that the  appellant  would  be
    asked if he is a member of the KDPI upon return to Iran, that he  could
    not be expected to lie under interrogation and that, by explaining that
    he was a member, he would expose himself to a risk of persecution.   In
    response to that submission, I observe  that,  first,  given  that  the
    appellant has not previously been known to the Iranian authorities  for
    any reason, it is not reasonably likely that he will be asked if he  is
    a member of the KDPI in the United  Kingdom  or  elsewhere  in  Europe.
    Secondly, if he is asked, then the appellant should be expected to tell
    the truth, which is that he had very recently joined a  branch  of  the
    KDPI with which he has had  no  previous  active  involvement  whatever
    solely for the purely cynical reason than that he wished to bolster his
    asylum claim.  I am aware from the background material that the Iranian
    authorities operate a highly sophisticated security service  and  I  do
    not consider it reasonably likely that the appellant would be  regarded
    by security officers, in the light of such an answer, as  a  threat  to
    the  Iranian  state  warranting   prosecution   or   persecution.    In
    conclusion, I find that the "certificate" from the KDPI does not,  read
    with the findings of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  which  have  been
    preserved, require me to find that the appellant faces a real  risk  of
    persecution either at the point of his return to Iran  or  subsequently
    whilst living in his home area of that country.

 6. The remaining issue concerns Dr  Joff�'s  report.   Dr  Joff�'s  report
    follows the most recent country guidance from  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    respect of Iran, SSH and HR (Legal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran  CG
    [2016] UKUT 00308 (IAC) that the head note of which reads as follows:

         (a) An Iranian male whom it is sought to return to Iran,  who  does
         not possess a passport, will be returnable  on  a  laissez  passer,
         which he can obtain from the Iranian Embassy on proof  of  identity
         and nationality.

         (b) An Iranian male in respect of  whom  no  adverse  interest  has
         previously been manifested by the Iranian State  does  not  face  a
         real risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3 rights  on  return
         to Iran on account of having left Iran  illegally  and/or  being  a
         failed  asylum  seeker.  No  such  risk  exists  at  the  time   of
         questioning on return to Iran nor after the facts (i.e. of  illegal
         exit and being a failed asylum seeker) have  been  established.  In
         particular, there is not a real  risk  of  prosecution  leading  to
         imprisonment.

    As regards the approach to the expert evidence taken by the Tribunal in
    SSH, I note the Tribunal's observations at [29]:

         "The problem with this argument, and it is equally the case too  in
         the context of the four cases to which we have  referred  above  of
         people who are said to have been detained and ill-treated on return
         to Iran, that there is on the one hand  an  absence  of  sufficient
         information about the individual case  and  on  the  other  hand  a
         significant lack of examples subsequent to that. One  might  expect
         that if the retired Supreme Court Judge was making an expression of
         something akin to policy that would be applied in future to  people
         who had been deemed to have insulted the state by claiming to  have
         been ill-treated when they had not been, then there would have been
         express examples of this as a way of showing that  the  authorities
         meant what they said. We note what Dr Kakhki said about the ways in
         which he obtains information about the  situation  in  Iran,  which
         include him being in regular contact with Iranian lawyers,  and  it
         seems to us highly unlikely that if there had been cases of  people
         being prosecuted under Article 500 on the basis that they had  made
         false asylum claims abroad that there would not have  been  mention
         of such cases in the media  and/or  within  the  legal  profession.
         Again in this regard we note what  is  quoted  at  page  9  of  the
         report, being remarks made by Iran's  Prosecutor  General  in  2011
         that Iranians who have committed a crime outside the country  while
         abroad and take action against their  national  security  could  be
         prosecuted. We accept that there is  little  tolerance  of  persons
         perceived as acting against national security,  and  that  national
         security  is  broadly  defined  (Operational  Guidance  Note   para
         3.12.7). But if it were the case that the notion of a person acting
         against national security included people who had made false asylum
         claims  abroad,  it  could  be  expected  that  details   of   such
         prosecutions would have emerged, bearing in  mind  the  numbers  of
         people returned from the United Kingdom alone in recent  years  and
         the lack of any evidence to show that there is  such  a  degree  of
         state control over the Iranian media and/or legal profession as  to
         prevent such information emerging. Indeed, one  might  expect  that
         the Iranian authorities would wish there to be publicity about such
         cases in order to deter others from acting in this way."

 7. As Mr Bates pointed out, Dr  Joff�'s  report  suffers  from  a  similar
    paucity of hard examples of  individuals  facing  persecution  in  Iran
    either on account of having legally exited the country or on account of
    their Kurdish ethnicity.  The Tribunal  in  SSH  touched  upon  Kurdish
    ethnicity in its conclusions at [34]:

         "It was not suggested to us that an individual faces risk on return
         on the sole basis of being Kurdish.  It  was  however  agreed  that
         being Kurdish was relevant to how a returnee would  be  treated  by
         the authorities. For example, the Operational Guidance Note  refers
         at 3.12.14 to the government disproportionally  targeting  minority
         groups, including Kurds, for arbitrary arrest, prolonged  detention
         and physical abuse. No examples however have been provided of  ill-
         treatment of returnees with no relevant  adverse  interest  factors
         other than their  Kurdish  ethnicity,  and  we  conclude  that  the
         evidence does not show risk of  ill-treatment  to  such  returnees,
         though we accept that it might be  an  exacerbating  factor  for  a
         returnee otherwise of interest. Accordingly we conclude that it has
         not been shown that a person in the position  of  these  appellants
         faces a real risk on return to Iran either on  the  basis  of  what
         would happen to them when questioned at the airport or subsequently
         if they were convicted of an offence of illegal exit.  With  regard
         to HR specifically, it does not appear to be disputed  that  he  is
         Kurdish and that he is undocumented: hence we  see  no  reason  for
         remittal. Prosecution for illegal exit is an outcome not  generally
         experienced by such returnees, and where it does  occur,  the  most
         likely sentence in relation to the illegal exit charge would  be  a
         fine. It has not been shown that there would  be  a  real  risk  of
         prosecution under Article 500 for propaganda against the  state  on
         the basis of having made an asylum claim  which  was  found  to  be
         false. Accordingly these appeals are dismissed."

 8. As regards the appellant's Kurdish ethnicity as a risk factor, Dr Joff�
    in his report at 112(iv) states:

         "In view of the worsening situation  inside  Iranian  Kurdistan  in
         recent  months  and  the  strong  official  prejudices  that  exist
         concerning Kurdish loyalties to the Islamic  Republic,  I  maintain
         the view, mentioned above, that failed Kurdish  asylum  seekers  if
         returned to Iran are more  likely  to  face  an  enhanced  risk  of
         persecution than other failed  Iranian  asylum  seekers  and  their
         situation has been exacerbated by concomitant official suspicion of
         involvement in political activity construed to be  opposed  to  the
         Islamic Republic or of engagement in  criminal  activity.   I  also
         consider this risk to have been significantly enhanced since  March
         2016 because of the renewal of hostile military action both by  the
         KDPI and the PJAK - the latter movement being the  one  with  which
         [the appellant] was probably involved as a sympathiser, despite the
         confusion over its actual title.  The risk has also, I submit, been
         enhanced by the new law on political crime adopted in January  2016
         and coming into force the following June (see para) 10 above)."

 9. In a footnote, Dr Joff� states that the new law provides  a  definition
    of "political offences" for the first time and notes that  it  excludes
    insults to minor officials and the spreading rumours  but  criminalises
    violent crime in attempts to overthrow the state as political offences.
     In the light of that legislative  development,  I  am  at  a  loss  to
    understand why this should have increased the  risk  to  an  individual
    such as this appellant who is not known  to  the  authorities  and  has
    (until very  recently)  had  no  political  involvement  in  opposition
    politics whatever.  Secondly, I note that the  risk  identified  by  Dr
    Joff� has, according to him, been "significantly enhanced" since  March
    2016 because of hostile militant action by the KDPI.  I note  that  the
    country guidance of SSH was promulgated following a hearing  in  London
    in May 2016.  If the risks had "significantly enhanced" at the time  of
    the country guidance hearing, it is not  clear  why  the  Tribunal  has
    placed little weight upon it.  One may only conclude that the  Tribunal
    did not share Dr Joff�'s opinion  of  the  significant  enhancement  of
    risk.

10. Thirdly, neither in the sub-paragraph which I have quoted or earlier in
    the report, does Dr Joff� give any examples of individuals  of  Kurdish
    ethnicity having been persecuted upon return  to  Iran  on  account  of
    their ethnicity only.  The absence in the report of such examples was a
    reason, according to Mr Bates, for the Tribunal to refrain going behind
    or beyond the guidance of SSH.  I agree.  As I have  noted  above,  the
    Tribunal in SSH did not find at  risk  where  there  were  no  concrete
    examples to indicate its existence.  I consider  that  to  be  a  sound
    methodology and I adopt it.  I do not consider  Dr  Joff�'s  report  as
    providing sufficient reason for me to find that the appellant's Kurdish
    ethnicity alone would expose him, in the  absence  of  any  other  risk
    factors, to persecution at the  point  of  return  to  Iran.   For  the
    avoidance of doubt, I  do  not  accept  that  the  appellant's  Kurdish
    ethnicity coupled with the fact of his illegal exit would be sufficient
    to lead to his persecution.

11. I am also concerned by some of the forms of expression used by Dr Joff�
    in his report.  At [108], Dr Joff� wrote:

         "I have sought to amass evidence above that the Iranian regime does
         severely discriminate against its  Kurdish  minority,  collectively
         and individually, simply because they are  Kurdish.   I  have  also
         sought to show that  such  discrimination  is  so  severe  that  it
         amounts to persecution."

12. This passage casts some doubt upon Dr Joff�'s methodology.  Instead  of
    considering all available evidence and drawing conclusions from it,  he
    has, instead, "sought to amass evidence" in order to prove a particular
    thesis.  First, this suggests that he might  omit  or  ignore  evidence
    which did not support his thesis.  Secondly, it indicates, as Mr  Bates
    submitted, a crossing  of  the  border  between  expert  testimony  and
    advocacy.   Thirdly,  it  is  not  clear  why  Dr  Joff�  considers  it
    appropriate to "amass evidence" to  support  the  thesis  that  Kurdish
    returnees are at risk on account of their ethnicity; equally, he  could
    have amassed evidence to support the proposition that they are  not  at
    risk.  I acknowledge Mr Howard's submission  that  Dr  Joff�  may  have
    simply have chosen his words poorly but the passage from which  I  have
    quoted does not inspire confidence in the impartiality of the evidence.
     Having said that, my primary reason for attaching  limited  weight  to
    the report is the failure of Dr Joff� to provide  examples  to  support
    his conclusions.

13. In the light of all the evidence, I find  that  it  is  not  reasonably
    likely this appellant having particular characteristics  as  identified
    by myself and by the First-tier Tribunal, would face  a  real  risk  of
    persecution or ill-treatment in Iran either at the point of his  return
    to that country  or  subsequently  whilst  living  in  his  home  area.
    Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
