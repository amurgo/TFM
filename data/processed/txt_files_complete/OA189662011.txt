                         NOTIFICATION OF WITHDRAWAL


 1. This appeal was taken against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge D'Ambrosio, promulgated on 3 November 2011.  It first came before
    the Upper Tribunal on 12 December 2012.  A note and further  directions
    were then issued, dated 13 December 2012.   (The  note  and  directions
    inadvertently refer to the respondent as the Secretary  of  State,  but
    the respondent is correctly the ECO.)



 2. On 9 May 2013, the UT gave notice of a resumed hearing on 5 June  2013.
    Morton Fraser, Solicitors wrote to the UT on 28 May 2013 advising  that
    their only instructions were to ask  for  the  appeal  to  be  formally
    withdrawn, and that they had no further instructions to appear, if  the
    UT did not agree to withdrawal.

 3. On the instructions of the Vice President, the UT advised parties on 31
    May 2013 that the case would remain listed for 5 June 2013.

 4. Mrs O'Brien advised that she had been in touch with the Entry Clearance
    Manager at New York.   The Appellant has been offered  the  opportunity
    of an interview to resolve the matter further but he intends to  remain
    in the USA at present and (apparently against the advice  he  has  been
    given) has decided to drop this appeal.

 5. In terms of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  Rule
    17, the appeal is recorded as having been withdrawn with the consent of
    the Upper Tribunal.   The  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    therefore stands.
