                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing on human rights grounds an appeal  against
    a  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  refusing  the   respondent,
    hereinafter "the claimant", leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. The Secretary of State's refusal letter is dated 26 March  2018.   This
    shows that the claimant entered the United Kingdom in October 2005 with
    entry clearance as a student and that his leave was extended by  stages
    in different capacities until June 2016.  On 3 November 2015 he applied
    for indefinite leave to remain  on  the  basis  of  ten  years'  lawful
    residence but the application was refused.  The claimant  initiated  an
    appeal against that decision but then withdrew the appeal.  On 28  June
    2016, shortly  before  he  withdrew  his  appeal,  he  made  a  further
    application for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of  ten  years'
    residence.  His application was unsuccessful because, in the opinion of
    the Secretary of State, it did  not  amount  to  a  fresh  claim.   The
    decision was made with reference to  paragraph  353  of  HC  395.   The
    remedy against that decision lay in judicial review.  Proceedings  were
    started and then resolved by  way  of  a  consent  order  so  that  the
    decision was reconsidered. It is that reconsidered decision on 26 March
    that led to this appeal.

 3. The Secretary of State found that  the  claimant  satisfied  the  Rules
    relating, for example, to his knowledge of  the  English  language  and
    life in the  United  Kingdom  but  the  application  was  refused  with
    reference to paragraph 276B(ii) and  (iii).   The  Secretary  of  State
    found that it was not in the public interest to  grant  him  indefinite
    leave because it would be undesirable and because the application  fell
    for  refusal  under  the  general  grounds  of  refusal.   There   were
    inconsistencies between sums of money  declared  to  the  Secretary  of
    State for the purpose of immigration applications and to HMRC  for  the
    purposes of paying tax.  With respect, the First-tier Tribunal set  out
    the problem particularly clearly at paragraphs 2 and 3 of the  decision
    where the judge said:

         "2.  His application was refused on  March  26,  2018  because  the
         respondent  was  satisfied  that  his  character  and  conduct,  in
         misleading  another  government  department,  would  lead  to   the
         undesirability of permitting him to remain  in  the  UK.   In  June
         2013, he made an application for further leave to remain as a  Tier
         1 (General) Migrant which was granted until  June  2016.   In  that
         application, he declared an earned income of �18,967.29 from Boots,
         which  is  not  disputed  and  self-employed  income  of   �17,450,
         totalling �36,417.29 to represent the required 35 out of 80  points
         from previous earnings as required under the  Rules.   In  November
         2015 he applied for indefinite leave to remain on  the  grounds  of
         long residence.  As part of the consideration  of  his  application
         enquiries were made at HMRC to cover the period 2010 - 11 and  2012
         - 13.  The records from HMRC revealed his self-employed  income  to
         be a turnover of �2,525 and a net profit of �515 for 2011 - 12  and
         a turnover of �5,089 and net profit of �830 in 2012 - 13.   He  was
         interviewed  in  November  2015  but  could  give   no   reasonable
         explanation  of  the  discrepancies  and  so  his  application  was
         refused.  The appellant lodged a  notice  of  appeal  against  that
         decision on February 2nd, 2016.

         3.   After the refusal in November 2015, the  appellant  lodged  an
         amended tax return to HMRC to show that he had earned more  in  the
         relevant years from self-employment  and  on  June  28th,  2016  he
         lodged his application, with the new tax records after  withdrawing
         the previous appeal on June 27th, 2016.  The respondent noted  that
         in interview the appellant said that the discrepancies were down to
         accounting errors and that he did not check the tax  return  online
         as he relied upon professionals to do so.  The respondent  did  not
         accept that explanation given the scale of the discrepancy and  the
         fact that it is the appellant's responsibility to ensure  that  the
         tax return is completed correctly.  The respondent considered that,
         the withdrawal of the first appeal was an attempt not to  have  the
         difference in earnings originally declared to  HMRC  considered  by
         the Tribunal on the  basis  that  the  Tribunal  may  find  in  the
         respondent's favour and the submission of the recent application of
         the amended records would be successful on the basis that HMRC  had
         not imposed a sanction for the amended tax records."

 4. The judge noted at paragraph 28  that  it  was  not  the  Secretary  of
    State's case that she had been deceived.   The  false  information  was
    given to the Revenue.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal did not have the benefit of the decision of the
    Court of Appeal in Balajigari and Others v SSHD  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  673
    because this was not promulgated until 16 April 2019 but as  far  as  I
    can see the First-tier Tribunal followed the approach required there in
    all material  particulars.   The  judge  clearly  understood  that  the
    discrepancy was big enough to attract attention and  then  went  on  to
    make an evaluative assessment  of  the  claimant's  credibility  having
    regard to his own evidence, the explanation  for  the  inconsistencies,
    such as it was, and the attitude of HMRC which was to not to impose any
    penalty still less initiate prosecution.

 6. Mr Ahmed, for the claimant, had one point  and  he  stuck  to  it  very
    firmly.   He  said  the  decision  of  the  First-tier   Tribunal   was
    permissible.  The point is potentially a good one.  I cannot  interfere
    with it unless it can be shown to be wrong in law.

 7. The Secretary of State's grounds expressed surprise at the decision and
    noted that it was the Tribunal's own finding  that  the  claimant  only
    rectified the situation after the error had been drawn to his attention
    by the Home Office.  The grounds took exception to the judge's  finding
    that the claimant "just did not declare that amount to HMRC and pay the
    appropriate level of tax".  The grounds  described  this  as  a  wilful
    failure to pay the appropriate level of tax obliged.

 8. I have reflected very carefully on this.  I am prepared  to  say  that,
    based on my reading of the papers, I find the decision surprising  but,
    unlike the First-tier Tribunal Judge, I did not  have  the  benefit  of
    hearing from  the  claimant.   He  had  no  real  explanation  for  the
    inconsistencies except claiming to have relied upon someone he  thought
    he could trust.  He said that he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of
    the record until challenged by the Secretary of State and so I  do  not
    see any additional point to be made by  his  not  correcting  it  until
    drawn to his attention there.  That was as consistent  with  his  case,
    namely that he was unaware of the error, as it is with being  dishonest
    and regretting it.

 9. The judge clearly gave considerable weight to the attitude of HMRC  but
    she was entitled to do that and I have concluded that the Secretary  of
    State's objections both in the grounds  and  the  amplification  by  Ms
    Aboni are, properly understood, no more than protests against  findings
    of fact that the Secretary of State does not like.

10. In dismissing the Secretary of State's appeal I do not wish to give any
    kind of any indication that  person's  whose  declared  income  to  the
    Revenue and  declared  income  to  the  Secretary  of  State  are  very
    different should assume that their explanation  of  innocence  will  be
    accepted.  This decision goes no further than its own particular facts.
     I am not persuaded that the judge misdirected herself or was  perverse
    in believing the evidence that was given on that occasion and for  that
    reason I dismissed the Secretary of State's appeal.

Notice of Decision

11. The Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of the  First-tier
