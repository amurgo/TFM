                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. On 26 September I wrote to the parties as follows:

         "Following the grant of permission, the  respondent  has  responded
         under rule  24,  accepting  that  there  is  merit  in  the  ground
         challenging the weight the judge  gave  to  the  failure  to  claim
         asylum  on  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom  when  the  principal
         appellant was a child and under the direction of adults around her,
         and inviting the Upper Tribunal to remit the appeal to  the  First-
         tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

         I propose to accept that invitation which I understand  applies  to
         all three appeals.

         Any submissions to the contrary will be accepted if received within
         21 days of the date of this letter."

 2. No submissions have been received.  I now set aside  the  determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal for error or law and remit  the  appellants'
    appeal for fresh consideration by that Tribunal.


                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                      Date: 31 October 2018.
