Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bednarek instructed by Broudie Jackson Canter
(Manchester)
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Buckley ('the Judge') promulgated on 4  March  2020,
        in which the Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds.
     2. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq, born on 5  May  1998,  who  was
        encountered by the police in  Kent  on  18  September  2017  having
        arrived in the UK clandestinely.
     3. It was not disputed the appellant is a national of Iraq of  Kurdish
        ethnicity, but most other issues were at large before the Judge.
     4. The Judge's main findings are set out between  [28  -  53]  of  the
        decision under challenge. In relation to the appellant's  claim  of
        risk arising in relation to events in Iraq the Judge writes:

        "35.      However, when considering the evidence that the Appellant
             will  be  personally  targeted  by  Hashd   Alshabi   and   the
             authorities on return, I am not satisfied  that  the  Appellant
             will come to the attention of the authorities and that he has a
             subjective fear of return. The Appellant, has  been  consistent
             throughout his claim that he wants to return to Iraq, and to be
             reunited  with  his  mother  and  sister;  this   is   repeated
             throughout the Appellant's initial witness  statement;  and  is
             clearly stated at the conclusion of his asylum  interview.  The
             Appellant, when he communicated with his  uncle  in  2016,  was
             primarily concerned about his mother and sister,  and  that  he
             wanted to return home. In the asylum interview, when asked  why
             the authorities would still  be  interested  in  him  now,  the
             responses from the Appellant rely on what he was  told  by  his
             uncle in relation to the  video,  and  the  killings  of  Hashd
             Officers by members of the group he was in. The  Appellant  has
             failed to explain how, given his  uncle's  involvement  in  the
             incident, how his uncle has managed to remain safely  in  Iraq,
             despite reporting to be at risk also. In response to AIR  Q130,
             the Appellant confirms that he is  not  aware  if  there  is  a
             warrant out for  his  arrest,  and  again  is  relying  on  the
             information his uncle has given him.


        36.  Further, in relation to any general risk to the Appellant  due
             to  his  father's  associations  with  the  Ba'ath  party,  the
             Appellant has been honest in his account that he  was  a  child
             and did not know about his father's activity,  and  also  until
             the events in June 2014, they had led a "good and normal" life.


        37.  Therefore,  although  I  accept  the  Appellant's  account  of
             events, to the lower standard, there is no  reason  to  believe
             that Hashd Al Shabi have ever directly targeted the  Appellant,
             or that they would do so upon the Appellant's return.  I  agree
             with the Respondent in its refusal letter that the Appellant is
             speculating regarding this; nor will Hashd  Al-Shabi  have  the
             infrastructure to recognise the Appellant, or identify  him  on
             return, following a one-off incident when he was 16 and when he
             ran away from the conflict.


        38.       I therefore, considering all the evidence in  the  round,
             do not find that the  Appellant  has  a  well-founded  fear  of
             persecution for a Convention reason."

     5. The Judge went on to consider the issue of documentation  accepting
        at [40] that the appellant no longer has his documents and will  be
        unable to recall the volume and  page  reference  of  the  relevant
        Family Book. The Judge finds the appellant will be reliant upon the
        support of a male family member to provide the necessary details to
        enable him to redocument himself in the UK;  leading  to  it  being
        concluded that the appellant  had  failed  to  provide  a  credible
        account in relation to the alleged loss of contact with his  uncle,
        for the reasons set out at [43 - 47], and did not find it plausible
        the appellant would not  be  able  to  remember  the  name  of  the
        restaurant he worked in in Turkey or could not contact  the  friend
        Dlovan for whom he worked for in the same restaurant  for  a  year,
        who could make contact with his uncle for him.
     6. At [49 - 50] the Judge writes:

        "49.      In light of the above findings, I am not  satisfied  that
             the Appellant has lost contact with his uncle as  claimed,  and
             therefore has not demonstrated, even  to  the  lower  standard,
             that he would be unable to communicate with his uncle and  that
             he would not have the support  of  his  uncle  to  provide  the
             details to obtain a replacement CSID or  have  the  support  on
             return to Iraq.


        50   I therefore find that it would be  reasonable  to  expect  the
             Appellant to obtain a  replacement  CSID  within  the  UK,  and
             within a reasonable  timeframe,  to  enable  him  to  have  the
             relevant documents to return to  Iraq,  and  travel  internally
             across Iraq if required; and it is likely  that  he  will  have
             family support upon his return. The Appellant can return to his
             home area, or relocate internally with support."

     7. Permission to appeal was granted by a Resident Judge of the  First-
        tier Tribunal  the  operative  part  of  the  grant  being  in  the
        following terms:

        "2.  The grounds assert that the Judge erred by failing to  address
             the background evidence accepted  in  SMO  and  others  to  the
             Appellant's circumstances, failing to  provide  any  evidential
             basis for the finding that the group Hashd Al-Shabi would  have
             the  infrastructure  to  identify  the  Appellant,  failing  to
             consider other material evidence, failing to  properly  address
             the evidence relates relating to obtaining a CSID  and  failing
             to properly consider internal relocation.


        3.   Given the finding that the Appellant is able to return to  his
             home area or internally relocate the last assertion  cannot  in
             isolation, be a material error of law.  The  other  grounds  do
             however have arguable weight. The Judge makes clear  in  recent
             positive credibility  findings,  but  then  finds  against  the
             subjective fear of Hashd Al-Shabi, because the Appellant failed
             to explain why his uncle has remained safely.  It  is  arguable
             that requiring the Appellant to explain  something  beyond  his
             own knowledge imposes too high a burden. Equally,  the  finding
             that the group does not have the infrastructure to identify the
             Appellant is made without any reference to  objective  material
             and is arguably speculative.


        4.   In dealing with risk on return. It is arguable that the  Judge
             is only considered the  headnote  of  SMO  and  Others  without
             addressing the detail to the Appellant's circumstances."


Error of law

     8. It is important to consider the merits of the challenge against the
        factual matrix relied upon by the appellant recorded by  the  Judge
        at [14(d) - (l)] of the decision under challenge in which the Judge
        writes:

        "(d)      On 14 June 2014, the Appellant  returned  home  from  the
             farm to discover his maternal uncle and his family  fleeing  an
             ISIS attack on Mosul.


        (e)  On 15 June 2014 the  entire  family  fled  the  village  after
             hearing ISIS had taken control of Mosul. They and the  rest  of
             the village fled to Tal Afar. They spent the  majority  of  the
             day with others at a checkpoint outside Tal Afar waiting to  be
             allowed into the town.


        (f)  They were searched individually at the checkpoint,  had  their
             personal details recorded and ID cards taken. They were  filmed
             by the authorities throughout this process. They eventually had
             their ID cards returned individually, filmed whilst  doing  so,
             were allowed into Tal Afar and directed towards "Old Tal Afar".
             The family parked the uncle's vehicle in a street  with  others
             and remained there.


        (g)  That night the Appellant heard  heavy  gunfire  close  to  the
             town. A number of hours later, Iraqi troops  and  militia  came
             into town. Many males went to  see  what  was  happening.  This
             included the Appellant, who  went  with  his  father,  brother,
             uncle and friends of his father and  uncle.  The  soldiers  and
             militia wanted all males, particularly young males, to join the
             fight against ISIS. The  Appellant's  family  and  others  were
             asked by Hashd Alshabi to help fight and defend the  town.  The
             Appellant's father refused. A  neighbour,  Rahman,  accuse  the
             Appellant's father being a former member of  the  Ba'ath  Party
             and refusing to fight because he supported  ISIS.  An  argument
             ensued between  the  Appellant's  father  and  uncle,  and  the
             authorities before someone shouted  "run".  The  Appellant  ran
             back towards the vehicle with others. A  gunfight  ensued.  The
             Appellant saw people falling, after being shot. The Appellant's
             father was shot and the Appellant also saw  his  brother  fall.
             The Appellant was grabbed by his uncle  and  told  to  continue
             running. At the vehicle, with the women  already  having  fled,
             the Appellant was given a bag and a mobile phone by his  uncle,
             and told to go in search of the females in the family and  told
             to call his uncle when he found them. The Appellant  went  with
             his uncle's friend, Ahmad


        (h)  The Appellant was never able to find his  mother  and  sister,
             nor his uncle's family.


        (i)       On the 15th or 16 June 2014, the Appellant left Iraq. The
             Appellant was taken by Ahmad through  Sinjar/Shingal  and  then
             into Turkey."

     9. The appellant told the Judge that in  Turkey  he  was  taken  to  a
        refugee camp for about six months but then transferred to a  second
        camp where he remained for between 16 to  18  months  before  being
        able to speak to his uncle in 2016. The appellant claimed his uncle
        told him it was not safe for him to return to Iraq as a  result  of
        the photographs taken of the appellant at  the  checkpoint  outside
        Tal Afar, claiming the appellant will be identified and  killed  if
        he returned.
    10. The appellant told the Judge that after this he was met  by  a  man
        named Dlovan and taken to Istanbul where he  remained  for  a  year
        working in this man's caf� and where the appellant was advised that
        his uncle give instructions  for  the  appellant  to  be  taken  to
        safety, indicating the appellant having spent a  considerable  time
        with Dlovan in his caf� in Istanbul and a line of  contact  between
        this person and the appellant's uncle. The  finding  of  the  Judge
        that the appellant  will  be  able  to  recall  the  name  of  this
        individual or the name of the caf� in Istanbul as a factor enabling
        him to make contact with relatives in Iraq has not been shown to be
        finding outside the range of those available to the  Judge  on  the
        evidence.
    11. In relation to the real risk on return, the appellant claimed  that
        he feared a real risk as a result of what his uncle told  him,  but
        nothing else, of returning to his home area. The  Judge  finds  the
        appellant could do so as there is no credible evidence he  will  be
        targeted on return.
    12. In relation to Hash Al-Shabbi, The Peoples Mobilization in  English
        or Popular Mobilisation Force (PMF), this was formed for deployment
        against the ISIS and Syria by uniting existing forces of the  Iraqi
        Ministry of Interior on 15 June 2014.  Their  creation  followed  a
        call to defend Baghdad and to participate in  the  counteroffensive
        against ISIS following the fall of Mosul on 10 June 2014.
    13. The Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) still exist although  28  July
        2016 the Iraqi government said that Hashd al-Shaabi forces were  to
        be placed on par with Iraq's army units  and  subject  to  military
        law.
    14. ISIS captured Tal Afar on 16 June 2014, after a two-day battle,  as
        recorded in an article in the Guardian newspaper of  17  June  2014
        and it was not until 20 August 2017 that the Iraqi Army launched  a
        new offensive to retake Tal Afar from the Jihadist forces. The city
        itself was recaptured by Iraqi forces on 27  August  2017  and  the
        remaining ISIS-held areas in Tal Afar district were then fully  re-
        captured on 31 August 2017.
    15. Whilst it is credible that those seeking  to  enter  this  district
        following the fall of Mosul would have had their details taken at a
        roadblock to ensure they were not ISIS fighters, the appellant  and
        his family were clearly allowed to enter Tal Afar indicating  there
        were no concerns as of 15 June  2014  that  they  had  an  interest
        adverse to that of the authorities in Iraq.
    16. The night the appellant claims he heard heavy gunfire close to  the
        town must, on the chronology recorded by the Judge, be on the night
        of the 15th /morning of 16th   June,  which  would  have  been  the
        advancing forces of ISIS who captured the city  on  16  June  2014.
        Even though there may have been a call to arms to defend the  city,
        which was eventually lost until  2017,  it  is  not  made  out  the
        appellant or any member of his family will be held to  be  culpable
        or suspected of being ISIS sympathisers.  There  is  merit  in  the
        Judge's finding that whilst the appellant  may  have  a  subjective
        fear, such fear was not objectively well-founded on  the  basis  of
        the evidence. The appellant at the time was only 16 years  of  age.
        It is not made out that even if a photographic record was taken  at
        the time of those who entered Tal Afar this creates a real risk for
        any such individual returning to that area, or  that  even  if  the
        appellant's father was a member of the  Ba'ath  in  the  past  this
        would create a real risk on return for  the  appellant.  There  was
        also nothing before the Judge to indicate that combination  of  the
        appellant circumstances would have the effect of enhancing his risk
        profile without more. The movement of people fleeing ahead of  ISIS
        is well documented involving tens of thousands of people  and  more
        than being a  member  of  this  group  was  required  to  establish
        objectively verifiable real risk  before  the  Judge.  The  Judge's
        finding that there was no evidence the appellant's uncle faced  any
        risk is also relevant as he  would  have  crossed  into  the  town,
        having had his details checked and photograph  taken  at  the  same
        time as the appellant.
    17. I find the appellant had failed to establish that either  he  could
        not trace family members or that he  would  face  a  real  risk  on
        return to Iraq in his home area.
    18. As it was not found the appellant had established a  credible  risk
        in his home area the findings  of  the  Judge  concerning  internal
        relocation are obiter as internal relocation is not relevant  if  a
        person can safely return to their home area.
    19. In relation to documentation and ability to return, the  Judge  was
        required to consider the whole of SMO  that  is  relevant  to  this
        appellant and address the appellant's reasonable circumstances.
    20. In addition to the country guidance case of SMO, elements of  which
        are being reconsidered by the Upper Tribunal together with a review
        of relevant documentation in September 2021, there is  available  a
        CPIN of June 2020 which also considers documentation. In SMO it was
        found  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  that  a  person  could  obtain   a
        replacement CSID from the Iraqi Embassy in the UK if they  had  the
        required information, which could be obtained from a male  relative
        in Iraq if the individual did not have the same themselves.
    21. It is accepted by the Secretary of State, however, that  since  the
        publication  of  SMO  there  have  been  further  developments.  At
        [2.6.16]  it  is  written  that  based  on  the  current  available
        information it is highly unlikely that an individual would be  able
        to obtain a CSID from the Iraqi Embassy while in the UK. Instead, a
        person would need to apply for a registration document  (1957)  and
        would then apply for an INID upon return to their local CSA  office
        in Iraq.
    22. The finding of the Judge at [50] that it  would  be  reasonable  to
        expect the appellant obtain a replacement CSID within  the  UK  and
        within a reasonable timeframe to enable him to  have  the  relevant
        document to return to Iraq and travel across Iraq if  required,  is
        therefore infected by legal error on the basis of an error of fact.
        It is accepted, the Judges decision is dated 10 February 2020,  and
        therefore prior to the publication of the June 2020 CPIN.  Although
        it could be said the Judge has not erred in law on the basis of the
        evidence  made  available  at  the  date  of  hearing,  the   Iraqi
        Nationality Document (IND) was in force at  the  date  of  decision
        before the Judge when the phasing out of the issuing  of  the  CPIN
        and need for an individual travel to their home area to obtain  the
        new document was  known.  I  will  therefore  consider  the  matter
        further on this basis.
    23. Information within the CPIN includes the following:

        'Civil Status Identity Cards (CSIDs)


        1) Please can you describe the process of obtaining a Civil  Status
        Identity Card for a failed asylum seeker from the Iraqi Embassy  in
        London in as much detail as possible  (please  include  details  of
        what documents or information are required, timescales etc).


        CSID cards are being phased out and replaced by INID (Iraq National
        Identification) cards. It is not currently possible to apply for an
        INID card outside of Iraq. As a result, the Iraqi embassy in London
        are advising their nationals in the  UK  to  apply  instead  for  a
        'Registration Document (1957)' which they  can  use  to  apply  for
        other documents such as passports or an INID card  once  they  have
        returned to Iraq.


        The registration  document  (1957)  must  be  applied  for  on  the
        applicant's behalf by a nominated representative in Iraq. In  order
        to start the application, the  individual  requiring  documentation
        would normally provide at least one copy  of  a  national  identity
        document (see above list Q1, FAS) and complete a power of  attorney
        (to nominate a representative in Iraq) at the Iraqi  embassy  along
        with the embassy issued application forms. If they have  no  copies
        of identity documents they also would need to  complete  a  British
        power of attorney validated by the FCO and provide  parents  names,
        place and date of birth to their nominated representative in Iraq.


        Once issued the nominated representative will send the registration
        document (1957) to the applicant in the UK. The process  takes  1-2
        months.


        The HO cannot apply for documentation other than Laissez Passers on
        someone's behalf but the embassy is willing to check to see if  the
        individual  already  holds  documents   and   provide   copies   if
        necessary.'

    24. Even if the appellant cannot obtain a replacement CSID it  was  not
        made out before the Judge that he will not  be  able  to  obtain  a
        registration document 1957), which is an official identity document
        within Iraq and different from a Laissez Passer, which is  a  "one-
        off use" document to enable an Iraqi national to  return  to  their
        home state.
    25. The comment in the final paragraph of the relevant section  of  the
        CPIN is of interest as it suggests that although  the  Home  Office
        cannot apply for anything other than  travel  document,  the  Iraqi
        Embassy is willing to check to see if the individual already  holds
        documents and to provide copies if necessary. The appellant  claims
        to hold a CPIN.
    26.  The  CPIN  sets  out  the  documentation  required  to  obtain   a
        registration document (1957) which  shows  that  document  must  be
        applied for on the appellant's behalf by a nominated representative
        in Iraq which is where the Judge's finding at [49], set out at  [6]
        above, is of importance, which has not been shown to be infected by
        material legal error.
    27. The Judge finds that the appellant will have  the  support  of  his
        uncle who  will  be  able  to  provide  the  details  to  obtain  a
        replacement CSID which must now be read  as  registration  document
        (1957).  It was not made out  the  appellant  cannot  approach  the
        Iraqi Embassy in the United Kingdom to complete a power of attorney
        to nominate his uncle as his representative in Iraq, although as he
        says he has no identity documents he can complete a  British  power
        of attorney validated by the FCO, providing  parents  names,  place
        and date of birth, and send it to his nominated  representative  in
        Iraq to allow the necessary applications  to  be  made  and  checks
        undertaken.
    28. It is not made out the appellant will  therefore  not  be  able  to
        obtain the necessary identity documents as found by the Judge.
    29. The point of return will be to Baghdad. It was not made out  before
        the Judge that the appellant will not have the means to  travel  to
        his home area to enable him to  provide  the  necessary  biometrics
        required  to  obtain  an  IND  and  therefore  have  the  necessary
        information to be able to fully function within Iraq. It is also an
        important finding by the Judge, that the appellant  will  have  the
        support of a male family member, namely his  uncle,  on  return  to
        Iraq.
    30. The appellant's home area is  in  Nineveh  Province,  Iraq's  third
        largest province, located in the northwest of Iraq.  The  appellant
        did not establish that he could not return home. The  appellant  is
        Kurdish but not  from  the  IKR,  and  the  burden  of  proving  an
        entitlement to  international  protection  exists  falls  upon  the
        appellant. It was not made out on  the  evidence  the  Judge  found
        credible that the appellant could not safely  return  to  his  home
        area, meaning he will not have to internally relocate to the IKR or
        elsewhere.
    31. I do not accept the appellant has established that the findings  of
        the Judge are outside the range of those  reasonably  available  to
        the First-tier Tribunal sufficient to warrant  the  Upper  Tribunal
        interfering any further in this matter, especially in light of  the
        recent guidance provided by the Court of  Appeal  making  it  clear
        that appellate judges should not interfere in a decision of a court
        below unless a clear legal error material  to  the  decision  under
        challenge has been established.
    32. When applying SMO and the latest developments set out in  the  CPIN
        to the appellant's circumstances it is not established the  Judge's
        conclusion the appellant had not established he was entitled  to  a
        grant of international protection or for leave  to  remain  in  the
        United Kingdom on human rights grounds,  or  on  any  basis,  is  a
        finding infected by material legal error.

Decision

    33. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.

    34. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

        I make such order pursuant to rule 14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
