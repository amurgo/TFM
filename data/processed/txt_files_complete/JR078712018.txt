                ____________________________________________



UPON considering written submissions from  both  parties  and  upon  hearing
from Ms Hafesji for the Claimant and Mr Paget for the Defendant

UPON undertaking  a  fact-finding  hearing  between  23-25  April  2019  and
handing down judgment on 14 May 2019

IT IS DECLARED:-

   1. The Claimant was born on 23 June 2003.

AND IT IS ORDERED:-

   2. The claim for judicial review is allowed.

   3. The Defendant shall pay the  Claimant's  costs  in  the  case,  to  be
      assessed if not agreed.

   4. The Defendant shall make a  payment  on  account  in  respect  of  the
      Claimant's costs in the sum of �42,500 by 28 May 2019.

   5. Insofar as  is  necessary,  there  is  to  be  an  assessment  of  the
      Claimant's publicly funded costs.

   REASONS


   6. There was only one issue  raised  at  the  handing  down  of  judgment
      hearing: the Defendant objected to the size of the costs to be paid on
      account.  The Claimant suggested this should be �60,000 as this  would
      reflect about 70% of the costs incurred.  The Defendant submitted that
      the total figure claimed is way too  high  and  that  the  payment  on
      account should be �30,000, as a standard  age  assessment  case  would
      normally involve costs at around �40,000.  I accept that this case has
      features atypical of many age assessments in particular, the  Claimant
      has been in the UK for three years and there is a complex history  for
      a number of reasons.  Doing the best I can in  all  the  circumstances
      �42,500 is an appropriate figure to be paid on account.

Ms K Hafesji for the Claimant, instructed by Osbornes Solicitors LLP
Mr M Paget for the Defendant, instructed by Surrey County Council

                                  JUDGMENT

Introduction

    1. In this claim the Claimant ('MRA') asserts he is a child, born on  2
       Tir 1382 in the Persian calendar, which equates to 23 June  2003  in
       the Gregorian calendar ('the 2003  dob').   The  Defendant  contends
       that this is not his real date of birth, but that he is three  years
       older than this, and was born on 22 June 2000 ('the 2000 dob').  MRA
       therefore claims that he  is  currently  15,  whilst  the  Defendant
       claims that he is 18.  The parties both  contend  that  my  task  in
       assessing MRA's age is a binary one, i.e. between the 2000  dob  and
       the 2003 dob.

    2. At the beginning of the hearing it was agreed that  irrespective  of
       his age, MRA should be treated as  a  vulnerable  witness.   He  has
       attempted suicide in the past and has been detained under the Mental
       Health Act 1983 ('the 1983 Act') for a significant period  in  2017.
       Many of those who are close to him have expressed concerns regarding
       his mental health since his arrival in the United Kingdom ('UK')  in
       March 2016, albeit this appears to have improved and been relatively
       stable in recent months.  In a psychiatric report  dated  29  August
       2018, Dr Rajpal concluded that MRA is fit to give evidence. He noted
       that MRA was diagnosed with  severe  depression  and  post-traumatic
       stress disorder ('PTSD') when he was sectioned under the  1983  Act,
       and that MRA reported continuing symptoms of nightmares, flashbacks,
       hyperarousal and avoidance that are consistent with PTSD.  There are
       also references in the documentary evidence to MRA possibly being on
       the autistic spectrum disorder,  but  no  firm  diagnosis  has  been
       reached on this.

    3. Throughout the hearing, and with  the  agreement  of  both  Counsel,
       adjustments were made in the light  of  MRA's  vulnerability  and  I
       confirm that I have treated him as a vulnerable witness.
Background
    4. The background is set out in summary only and  seeks  to  reflect  a
       chronology agreed by the parties.

    5. MRA is a citizen of Iran.  He lived in Tehran with his  mother,  who
       was a  teacher,  his  father,  who  was  a  member  of  the  Iranian
       Revolution Guard Corps, and  two  brothers  (his  elder  brother  is
       approximately 10 years older than him and his  younger  brother  was
       less than a year old at the time the family left Iran).  MRA  claims
       that they were forced to leave Iran after his father helped a number
       of Afghan refugees to escape.  MRA also claims that when  attempting
       to leave Iran (unlawfully) by lorry in October/November 2015, he was
       separated from his family members.  He believes that  the  lorry  in
       which his family were travelling was stopped, and  that  his  family
       were returned to Iran. He suspects that they have been  detained  or
       killed, but does not know what has actually become of them.

    6. MRA claims to have travelled overland from Turkey until his  arrival
       in the UK on 17 March 2016 on his own (if correct  this  would  have
       involved many months of travelling under the control of  an  agent).
       It is undisputed that when he first  arrived  in  the  UK,  MRA  was
       arrested  by  the  police  and  then  placed  immediately  into  the
       Defendant's care. He provided the 2003 dob to both  agencies.   That
       made him 12 at the  time.   This  appears  to  have  been  at  least
       initially accepted by the Defendant, when  MRA  was  placed  in  his
       first foster placement in Twickenham Gardens. This  placement  broke
       down on 19 April 2016, after which MRA was  provided  with  a  short
       emergency placement before being moved to a second foster placement,
       with Mr and Mrs Turner in Croydon.  MRA only stayed  there  for  two
       nights, because the couple had two dogs in the  home  and  MRA  felt
       uncomfortable living there for reasons relating to his then  Islamic
       faith and upbringing.   On  20  April  2016  MRA  missed  his  first
       appointment with the Home Office because of  the  breakdown  of  his
       placement.  At that stage the Home  Office  recorded  MRA's  age  by
       reference to the 2003 dob.

    7. On 22 April 2016, MRA was  collected  at  night  by  three  men  who
       transported him to Brodworth  House,  residential  accommodation  in
       Manchester.  MRA claims that residing in  an  institution  made  him
       extremely distressed.  MRA absconded and was stopped by  the  police
       and hospitalised on 23 April 2016.  The police called  MRA's  social
       worker.  After being returned  to  Brodworth  House,  MRA  attempted
       suicide by tying a ligature around his neck on 25 April  2015.   MRA
       was hospitalised from this point to 28 April 2016, when he was moved
       to his third foster placement.  It was around  this  time  that  MRA
       informed his social worker that he was 15 years old.  This  was  the
       first time he relied upon the 2000 dob.  MRA claims that he  changed
       his age in the hope that this would assist in the process  of  being
       moved to a different placement,  that  he  believed  would  be  more
       suitable for him.  This change in claimed age was  accepted  by  the
       Defendant without any further formal inquiry or assessment until the
       June 2018 age assessment   (the  subject  of  this  judicial  review
       challenge).

    8. On 28 April 2016 MRA  was  moved  to  another  foster  placement  in
       Croydon with Mr Nazemi.  He remained here until April 2017.

    9. On 26 May 2016 MRA missed a second screening  appointment  with  the
       Home Office because  of  complications  consequent  on  the  earlier
       placement breakdown.  At this point the Home Office  recorded  MRA's
       age by reference to the 2000 dob, which has remained the position to
       date.

   10. On 1 July 2016 MRA attended a screening  interview  for  his  asylum
       claim.  He provided the interviewing officer with the 2000 dob.   In
       a witness statement  dated  16  November  2016,  prepared  with  the
       assistance of immigration solicitors, MRA placed reliance  upon  the
       2000 dob.  MRA was interviewed  regarding  his  asylum  claim  on  9
       December 2016.  On 19 December 2016 his immigration solicitors  made
       detailed  representations  regarding  MRA's  asylum  claim.    These
       referred to the 2000 dob.  MRA claims that during  his  interactions
       with the Home Office regarding his asylum claim he "kept quiet about
       the lie" regarding his age.

   11. Between September 2016 and April 2017, the social care notes  record
       ongoing concerns regarding MRA's placement with  Mr  Nazemi.   MRA's
       mental health declined and he began to abscond from  4  April  2017.
       At around this time, MRA was hospitalised.  On 11  April  2017,  MRA
       was moved to a residential  placement  in  Croydon.   Shortly  after
       this, MRA was again hospitalised on various  occasions.   Whilst  at
       Bethlem Hospital on 19 April 2017, he told Dr Hayes that he was 14.

   12. On 4 May 2017, MRA was sectioned under the 1983 Act whilst  detained
       by the police.  He remained in custody until 7 May 2017, when he was
       moved to the Priory  Clinic  in  Manchester  ('the  Priory').    The
       Defendant  contacted  MRA's  immigration  solicitors  to  raise  the
       deterioration in MRA's mental health.   MRA  was  further  sectioned
       under section 3 of the 1983 Act on 3 June 2017.  This was  confirmed
       by a Mental Health Review Tribunal.  MRA  was  discharged  from  the
       Priory on 28 September 2017, with a diagnosis of  severe  depressive
       episodes, psychotic  episodes,  and  PTSD.   He  was  discharged  on
       Quetiapine and Sertraline.

   13.  Upon  his  discharge  on  25  September  2017,  MRA  was  moved  to
       residential  accommodation  in  Stoke,  Trent  Valley   House.    He
       contacted the Defendant on 28 September 2017  to  clarify  that  the
       Priory incorrectly recorded his age.  MRA was unhappy  to  be  at  a
       residential unit and ran away frequently to stay in London.    After
       a review on 27 November  2017  Dr  Latif,  a  consultant  child  and
       adolescent psychiatrist, noted in a letter dated  18  December  2017
       that MRA was not taking his medication and it was important that  he
       did so. MRA resumed his absconding from the residential unit and did
       not return after 1 December 2017.  MRA started to receive help  from
       the Refugee Council and an advocate from CORAM, Mr Cisse from  about
       December 2017.

   14. Between January and April 2018,  MRA  reports  that  he  was  'sofa-
       surfing'  in  London.   He  refused  placements  suggested  by   the
       Defendant.  He claims that he stayed with his  friend,  Farshad,  or
       with Farshad's brother, and slept on the floor of a restaurant where
       Farshad worked.

   15. MRA instructed Osbornes Solicitors (who continue to act for  him  in
       relation to his 'community  care'  issues)  in  February  2018.   He
       confirmed to them that the 2003 dob is correct and the 2000  dob  is
       false.   Upon  the  involvement  of  Osbornes  in  March  2018,  the
       Defendant agreed to carry out an age assessment.

   16. The assessment was carried out by MRA's social  worker,  Mr  Russell
       over the course of four meetings (27 March 2018, 11 April  2018,  24
       April 2018, 23 May 2018).  On 10 May 2018  MRA  moved  to  a  foster
       placement in Ilford with Mr and Mrs Hamid.

   17. MRA's application for asylum was refused by the Secretary  of  State
       for the Home Department for reasons set out in a decision  dated  17
       May 2018.  He has a pending appeal  against  this  decision  to  the
       First-tier Tribunal, the hearing of which has been adjourned pending
       the outcome of these proceedings.

   18. The age assessment decision is dated 8 June  2018.   This  concluded
       that MRA was 17 years old and the 2000 dob is the correct one.

   19. On 30 September 2018 MRA was baptised at the Holy  Trinity  Brompton
       Church ('HTB').  On 4 February 2019, MRA  moved  to  foster  parents
       located by Ms Alyson Frazier of the  charity  'Play  for  Progress'.
       They are Reverend and Mrs Maclure, who live in Isleworth with  their
       three children.  MRA remains living with the Maclure family  and  by
       all accounts has settled in well into this foster placement.

   20. The application for judicial review of the age assessment was lodged
       on 12 September 2018.   This,  together  with  the  application  for
       urgent consideration  and  interim  relief  was  considered  by  Mrs
       Justice Yip.  In an order  dated 23 November 2018 she  granted  both
       permission and interim relief.  The application was then transferred
       to the Upper Tribunal.  There  have  been  various  case  management
       directions, and the matter now comes before me.

Evidence

   21.  MRA's  solicitors  have  provided  six  comprehensive  bundles   of
       documentary evidence. These have been meticulously prepared and I am
       grateful to those  involved  in  compiling  them.   Apart  from  the
       witnesses and  the  Defendant's  age  assessment  (and  accompanying
       notes), the other documentary evidence in  this  case  includes  the
       following, inter  alia:  medical  evidence  from  CAMHS,  MRA's  GP,
       discharge summaries from hospitals and a psychiatric report prepared
       by  Dr  Rajpal;  MRA's  social  care  records;  MRA's  asylum  claim
       documentation; correspondence between the parties.

   22. Over the first two days of the hearing I heard  oral  evidence  from
       MRA and witnesses in support of the 2003 dob.   They were each cross-
       examined by Mr Paget.  These witnesses include the following:
      - Ms Finlay-Hall - a Drama and Movement Therapist with  20  years  of
        experience of working with a wide range of young people and adults,
        including  refugee  communities  and  those  who  have  experienced
        complex trauma.  She worked with MRA  on  several  occasions  since
        April 2018 and has attended residential trips  with  him,  together
        with Dr Macdonald and Ms Frazier, in their capacity as facilitators
        for programmes by 'Play for Progress'.   This  is  a  Croydon-based
        charity that delivers therapeutic  and  educational  activities  to
        traumatised and socially isolated unaccompanied minor refugees.
      - Mr Hawes -  who  attended  the  age  assessment  with  MRA  as  his
        appropriate adult.
      - Mrs Maclure - has  been  MRA's  foster  parent  together  with  her
        husband Reverend Maclure since 4 February 2019.
      - Reverend Maclure
      - Dr Macdonald - the co-founder and programme director  of  Play  for
        Progress, a Croydon-based charity.   She  also  has  experience  of
        working as a doctor in accident and emergency.  She has worked with
        MRA since 2017, when he began attending Play for Progress.
      - Ms Frazier - the co-founder and  programme  director  of  Play  for
        Progress, who has known MRA since the end of 2017.
      - Mr Cisse - MRA's advocate from CORAM since December 2017.
      - Ms MacDonald - a member of  the  Iranian  Christian  Fellowship,  a
        member of HTB and a mentor to MRA since September 2018.
   23. On the first day of the hearing MRA gave detailed evidence from 1.45
       to 4.15, with the assistance of an interpreter. I  am  satisfied  he
       understood the interpreter and the interpreter understood him.  I am
       satisfied he was fully aware that he was welcome to ask for a  break
       in the proceedings when he wanted one.   He took  two  breaks.   His
       chair was positioned in a manner that was most comfortable for him.

   24. On the second day  of  the  hearing  I  heard  evidence  from  three
       witnesses on behalf of the Defendant:
      - Ms Gouveia-Schofield - had  oversight  of  MRA  on  behalf  of  the
        Defendant from March 2017 to August 2018.  She was the only  social
        worker and the only person working for the Defendant to  give  oral
        evidence.
      - Mr Nazemi was MRA's foster carer between April 2016 and April 2017.
      - Mr Goodwin - is the safeguarding officer at HTB.  He met  MRA  once
        after a concern was raised by a youth team  leader  in  March  2018
        that MRA was claiming to be 14 and might be older.
Submissions

   25. On the third and final day of  the  hearing  I  heard  very  helpful
       closing submissions  from  both  Counsel.   They  each  relied  upon
       detailed and comprehensive skeleton arguments, as  well  as  written
       closing submissions. At the end of the submissions,  I  reserved  my
       decision, which I now provide with reasons.

   26. For the avoidance of doubt, in making my decision I have taken  into
       account all of the evidence  and  submissions,  including  that  not
       specifically discussed or referred to or specifically listed in this
       judgment.  I focus on the more important evidence relied  on  during
       the course of the hearing and in submissions in more  detail  below,
       when making my findings.

Legal framework

   27. The legal framework is not in dispute and can  therefore  be  stated
       briefly.   In these proceedings, the task of the Upper  Tribunal  is
       to resolve for itself, as a matter of fact, the issue of age -  R(A)
       v Croydon LBC [2009] 1 WLR 2557.  Put simply there is a right and  a
       wrong answer and it is for the Tribunal to provide it.  I  must,  in
       essence, act in an inquisitorial manner and determine for myself, on
       the balance of probabilities, whether MRA was or was not a child  at
       the date of the age assessment, as well as his actual date of  birth
       - R(AE) v London Borough of Croydon [2012] EWCA Civ 547.   There  is
       no burden of proof in the  proceedings  and  although  there  is  no
       formal 'benefit of the doubt principle', the evidence should not  be
       viewed  without  sympathy,  given  that  on  any  view  MRA  arrived
       unaccompanied, after a lengthy journey and without original identity
       documents - R(CJ) v Cardiff CC [2011] EWCA Civ 1590.

   28. In cases such as this one, where documentary  evidence  relevant  to
       MRA's age is lacking, the "starting point" for the  Tribunal's  task
       of determining age will be the credibility of that individual's  own
       evidence: see AE (supra), per Aikens  LJ  at  [44].  The  Tribunal's
       "primary  focus"  should  be  the  credibility  of  an  individual's
       evidence concerning his age. However, "it  is  permissible  to  have
       regard to credibility more generally provided that,  in  looking  at
       credibility more generally, the primary focus...is  not  forgotten":
       see R (MVN) v London Borough of Greenwich  [2015]  A.C.D.  141,  per
       Picken J at [27].

Approach to the evidence

   29. I have considered and had regard to all the evidence before me. This
       is not simply to decide whether to prefer the 2000 dob or  the  2003
       dob.  Rather, I have considered all the evidence  in  the  round  in
       order to decide what MRA's date of birth is more than not likely  to
       be.  Although this was presented as  a  binary  choice  between  two
       dates, I have considered all the evidence to  determine  for  myself
       MRA's date of birth.  I must determine the weight to be attached  to
       MRA's evidence, with the primary focus being the credibility of  his
       evidence as to his age.  I accept Mr  Paget's  submission  that  the
       credibility of MRA's account of his age is key in this case.

   30. In making findings on MRA's  age  I  have  taken  into  account  the
       witness and documentary evidence in support of MRA's claimed age and
       the witness and documentary evidence that undermines his claim.   In
       so doing, I must also determine the weight to be attached to the age
       assessment.  Having considered all the evidence in the round I  must
       reach my own decision on MRA's age at the date of the age assessment
       and his date of birth.
Findings

MRA's evidence
   31. Having heard MRA give oral evidence during the course  of  sustained
       cross-examination and  having  considered  this  alongside  all  the
       evidence (including the evidence provided by all the  witnesses  and
       the documentary evidence) in the round, I have reached the  decision
       that his evidence before me has been largely  credible  and  broadly
       consistent.  I now turn to his evidence, and the evidence  which  is
       either  supportive  of  it  or  capable  of   undermining   it,   in
       chronological order below when making my findings.

   32. It is undisputed that upon his arrival in the UK alone on  17  March
       2016, MRA was arrested by the police and  very  shortly  after  this
       placed into the Defendant's care.  Although there was a minor  error
       in the date of birth first recorded (which was probably  related  to
       initial difficulties in the Persian calendar translation),  from  17
       March 2016, MRA provided the Persian calendar version  of  the  2003
       dob.  This is set out in the first placement request record of  that
       date and maintained in subsequent social care records to late  April
       2016.  I accept Ms Hafesji's submission that there  is  no  credible
       evidence to support the Defendant's suggestion in the age assessment
       decision that MRA was told to lie about his age when he  arrived  in
       the  UK.   This  suggestion  is   entirely   contradicted   by   the
       contemporaneous records taken by the assessing social worker and the
       appropriate adult.  I note that as at 20 April 2016 the Home  Office
       recorded MRA's age by reference to the 2003 dob, albeit that changed
       to the 2000 dob subsequently.

   33.  It is important to place the reliability of MRA's  early  assertion
       as to his age in context.  I  accept  MRA's  evidence  that  he  was
       brought up in a family and cultural context in which he was told his
       date of birth, by reference to the Persian calendar, from  an  early
       age.  Ages are recorded in Iran and I accept MRA's evidence that  he
       referred to and relied upon the  2003  dob  for  school  and  extra-
       curricular purposes for as long as he can remember.

   34. I also accept that at least for the first month after his arrival in
       the UK, MRA consistently and vociferously maintained the  2003  dob.
       This is consistent with the review notes for  7  April  2016,  which
       include the following: "[MRA] has expressed his  concern  and  upset
       that people are challenging his age.  He told us that he is  telling
       the truth about how old he thinks he is.  He was advised that an age
       assessment will be undertaken."

   35. MRA was initially placed in two foster placements in Greater  London
       in quick succession, but  both  of  these  were  unsuccessful.   The
       reasons for this are less relevant to an analysis of MRA's age, than
       the impact upon him.  Unfortunately the Defendant  appears  to  have
       labelled MRA as a person who actually (rather than  allegedly)  used
       violence against  the  daughter  of  the  first  foster  carer  when
       criminal charges were not pursued.  Ms  Gouveia-Schofield  was  very
       reluctant to accept  that  her  statement  was  misleading  in  this
       respect and failed to clearly acknowledge that it  was  an  unproven
       allegation without more.  In addition, the Defendant's  social  care
       notes appear to describe the second  foster  carer,  Mrs  Turner  as
       being concerned that MRA was difficult and appeared older  than  his
       claimed age.  Mrs Turner has clarified in a witness  statement  that
       she said no such  thing  and  emphasised  that  she  believed  MRA's
       behaviour and appearance was consistent with  being  a  12-year-old.
       She described him as being very upset, frightened, and crying  about
       being moved to Manchester.  It is clear from his  own  evidence  and
       the social care notes, that right from the beginning, MRA  was  very
       concerned to be placed in accommodation with a family he  got  along
       with in the London area.  He has been consistently  resistant  to  a
       residential placement throughout his time in the UK.

   36. Significantly, MRA maintained the 2003 dob during the course of  his
       first two foster placements and it was only after  he  spent  a  few
       days in Manchester that he said that he was 15 and not  12/13.   For
       the avoidance of doubt, it is not  disputed  that  MRA  referred  to
       himself as 13 in March / April 2016 because it is customary in  Iran
       to describe oneself as 13 i.e. in the 13th year, when 12 years  old.
       I was provided with two witness statements from academics to confirm
       this.  Mr Paget confirmed that the Respondent did not  dispute  this
       evidence, as did Ms Gouveia-Schofield.

   37. MRA was moved to Brodworth House in Manchester on 22 April  2016  in
       very difficult circumstances.  These  have  been  described  by  Mrs
       Turner in her statement and were not disputed by the Defendant.  MRA
       did not wish to leave London and  did  not  wish  to  reside  in  an
       institution.  I accept his evidence that he was scared,  lonely  and
       very upset at the time.  I also accept that shortly after  this,  he
       attempted suicide by hanging and was hospitalised.

   38. The circumstances in which MRA changed his age from 12/13 to  15  in
       April 2016 are for obvious reasons important.  There  are  no  clear
       social care notes setting out the context in which MRA gave the 2000
       dob.  This was a significant event and MRA's disclosure occurred  at
       a time when he was on any view a vulnerable young person without  an
       advocate or solicitor and deeply unhappy,  yet  there  has  been  no
       cogent explanation from the Defendant for the absence of any  notes.



   39. Mr Paget invited me to find that MRA did not have a good  reason  to
       lie regarding the 2000 dob and I should reject his  explanation  for
       changing his age.  When pressed by Mr Paget, MRA  accepted  that  he
       lied when he gave the 2000 dob in April 2016 and maintained that lie
       until April 2017, including during the early critical stages of  his
       asylum claim.  That MRA lied regarding his age is  not  in  dispute.
       He relied upon two different dates  of  birth  at  different  times.
       That in itself reflects adversely on his credibility but when  asked
       why he lied when he relied on the 2000 dob, MRA was steadfast in his
       evidence.   His  explanation  is  plausible  and  credible  for  the
       comprehensive reasons provided by Ms Hafesji at [19] to [25] of  her
       closing written submissions.

   40. MRA was adamant that he felt "forced" to change his  "real  date  of
       birth".  He  explained  that  he  was   very   unhappy   about   his
       accommodation and thought that by increasing his  age,  his  options
       would improve.  He explained that he believed this to  be  the  case
       based on what he was told by his social worker at the time  i.e.  if
       he  was  older  than  his  claimed  age  he   may   have   different
       accommodation options available for him.  There is support for MRA's
       understanding in social care notes created  by  Julie  Wilby  on  14
       April 2016.  This includes the following: "if [MRA] is in  agreement
       that he is older than 16 (year 11) semi-independent placement can be
       requested."  MRA's evidence that he was told by  his  social  worker
       that there is a link between an older age and being able  to  access
       other types of accommodation is also consistent with the social care
       notes for 21 April 2016.  This records the following on the part  of
       Ms Olunlade, MRA's social worker at the time: "I told him if he  was
       older say about 16  years  old  he  may  consider  semi  independent
       placement. [MRA] like this idea and questioned the reason  he  could
       not be place within a  semi  independent  placement...".    This  is
       reinforced by a social care note made by Emma Atic-Lee on  the  same
       day, which records a conversation the author had with  Ms  Olunlade,
       which states as follows:

"...Grace also added that [MRA] has said that he believes he must  be  older
than 12 and more likely to be 15-16 - he is hoping that this would open  the
possibility of him being offered semi-independent  placement.   As  we  have
not as yet been able to complete full age assessment this  is  difficult  to
accept from [MRA].


Stephen Russell contacted Karen Jackson and Karen  informed  that  placement
had not been identified as yet.  She did say that should the age  assessment
show that [MRA] could be in Year  12  at  school  that  would  open  further
options regarding accommodation..."

   41. Mr Paget invited MRA to accept that there was  no  reason  to  claim
       that he was 15 at the time because it was only if  he  had  attained
       the age of 16 that his accommodation options would be different, and
       in any event the claimed lie did not lead  to  the  semi-independent
       accommodation he then wished to have.  I accept MRA's evidence  that
       he understood his social worker as saying that if he was a bit older
       or  to  quote  Ms  Olunlade's  note  "about  16",  things  might  be
       different.  I accept that MRA did not properly appreciate the  exact
       requirements and was merely trying to improve his circumstances in a
       clumsy and misguided manner, at a time  when  on  any  view  he  was
       vulnerable, lonely, upset and depressed.

   42. MRA's evidence was that he changed his age to the 2000 dob, when  he
       was  in  hospital.   As  he  put  it  during  cross-examination  his
       "condition was bad" at the time.    When  asked  if  there  was  any
       reason to  dispute  MRA's  evidence  in  this  respect  Ms  Gouveia-
       Schofield confirmed that she did not have any.  She  was   asked  to
       confirm  if  it  was  plausible  that  a  young  person   in   MRA's
       circumstances might  interpret  his  social  worker's  reference  to
       needing to be a certain age in order to access the accommodation  he
       wanted, in such a manner to cause him to change the age that he  had
       maintained consistently for over five weeks to  an  older  age.   Ms
       Gouveia-Schofield declined to provide  any  meaningful  response  to
       this apart from to emphasise that she was not involved in MRA's care
       at that stage.  As Ms Hafesji observed, the Defendant did not tender
       any witness with direct involvement  with  MRA  in  April  2016.   I
       accept that MRA has provided a plausible reason to claim that he was
       15 when he  was  in  fact  12  in  April  2016.   His  reasoning  is
       consistent with what he later said when hospitalised in April  2017.
       I address this in more detail below.   The Defendant invited  me  to
       find that the 2000 dob disclosure took place between 25 and 28 April
       2016 and it is unclear whether it took place whilst in  hospital  or
       on the way back to London.  Doing the best  I  can,  and  given  the
       unexplained absence of any notes on the part  of  the  Defendant,  I
       accept the 2000 dob disclosure happened  as  MRA  claimed,  in  late
       April 2016 when he was hospitalised in Manchester,  but  before  MRA
       went to live with Mr Nazemi.  Ms Gouveia-Schofield  accepted  and  I
       find that there is no good reason to dispute MRA's clear evidence in
       this respect.  I also accept MRA's explanation  for  'changing'  his
       age at this point.

   43. On 28 April 2016 MRA was moved to his new foster placement  with  Mr
       Nazemi in Greater London.  Although the change in age did  not  lead
       to semi-independent accommodation, it did (at least in the  eyes  of
       MRA) lead to him not being in residential care and being placed with
       a foster carer in the London area.   I  accept  that  MRA  genuinely
       believed that if he disclosed that which he believed  was  his  true
       age whilst he lived with Mr Nazemi,  he  risked  being  returned  to
       residential care in Manchester.   I  also  accept  that  this  is  a
       material reason why he maintained the 2000  dob  for  a  substantial
       period of time, after his return to a foster placement in London.

   44. I acknowledge that MRA gave the 2000 dob to a  number  of  different
       recipients when he resided with Mr Nazemi  between  April  2016  and
       April 2017.  Mr  Paget  drew  attention  to  various  categories  of
       recipients, and asked me to  find  it  implausible  that  MRA  would
       continue to lie to such a wide variety of  recipients  over  such  a
       lengthy period, for no obvious benefit, if his  age  was  any  other
       than consistent with the 2000 dob.  Mr Paget focussed his  attention
       upon the date of birth recorded  for  the  purposes  of  the  asylum
       claim, which I now turn to.

   45. The aspect of MRA's evidence that I have found most  concerning  was
       his failure to disclose what he maintained to be his true age to his
       immigration solicitors.  MRA did not make his asylum claim  until  1
       July 2016.  The Defendant accepts that any  delay  is  not  properly
       attributable to MRA.  The social work  records  from  shortly  after
       MRA's arrival describe the Home Office having been notified  of  MRA
       and of steps being taken to make an asylum claim.  It is clear  that
       from shortly after his arrival MRA disclosed that he was  afraid  to
       return to Iran for broadly the same reasons he has maintained since.
        The asylum record sheet states that as early as 22 March  2016,  an
       asylum appointment was booked for 20 April 2016, but MRA was  unable
       to attend interviews for reasons relating to placement breakdowns.

   46. MRA's immigration solicitors were instructed on 9 August 2016.  They
       assisted him in preparing  a  detailed  asylum  statement  dated  16
       November 2016.  In it MRA described himself as 16 and gave the  2000
       dob.  When interviewed regarding his asylum claim on 9 December 2016
       MRA was accompanied by his solicitor.   His  immigration  solicitors
       made detailed written representations regarding MRA's  asylum  claim
       on 19 December 2016.  There was no attempt to clarify MRA's date  of
       birth by MRA or his immigration solicitors at this time. However,  I
       accept Ms Hafesji's submission that little was done on the  part  of
       the Defendant to be pro-active in  assisting  MRA  with  his  asylum
       claim or in providing clearly relevant detailed information  to  his
       immigration solicitors, at this stage.  The matter was  left  mostly
       to Mr Nazemi.  There is scant evidence that he was pro-active beyond
       finding a solicitor.  I  accept  Ms  Hafesji's  submission  that  Mr
       Nazemi was unlikely to  have  properly  supported  MRA  through  his
       asylum claim when the social  care  notes  make  it  clear  that  he
       believed MRA was at least 20 at the time  and  was  fabricating  his
       mental health problems.   This means that the immigration solicitors
       do not appear to have been told by anyone, at the  time  when  MRA's
       asylum statement was made or for the purposes of  the  interview  or
       written  representations  (November  to  December  2016),   detailed
       information regarding two important aspects  of  MRA's  history:  he
       initially claimed to be much younger and he presented at times  with
       a fragile mental health including a suicide attempt in  April  2016.
       The  Defendant's  first  recorded  contact  with   the   immigration
       solicitors in the  agreed  chronology  is  30  May  2017,  when  the
       deterioration in MRA's mental health following  his  sectioning  was
       raised.  By this time the Home Office had already been provided with
       all the relevant information for the purposes of the  asylum  claim,
       and a decision on the claim was merely awaited.  After December 2016
       very little happened in relation to MRA's asylum  claim,  until  his
       claim was refused in the decision dated 17 May 2018.

   47. It follows from the chronology concerning his asylum claim that  MRA
       had obvious opportunities to disclose his claimed true date of birth
       to his immigration solicitors between July and December  2016.   MRA
       explained and I accept that this remained a very difficult time  for
       him  and  he  was  petrified  about  returning  to  the   Manchester
       residential placement.  He nonetheless described his maintenance  of
       the 2000 dob to have regularly "played on his mind".   He  described
       this as "like a tumour on my brain"  and  said  there  was  a  "pain
       inside of me...contributed to me being unwell".   This  evidence  is
       consistent with the record made in the  social  care  notes  for  20
       April 2017: "[MRA] said that he feels really guilty as he  had  been
       lying to people and said that he is 14 years old  and  not  16.   He
       further stated that he had been advised when he was in Manchester to
       say this and he did and stuck to it but now  realises  he  needs  to
       tell the truth" and the actual in-patient  record  confirmed  by  Dr
       Hayes for 19 April 2017 which includes a  reference  to  MRA  having
       reported being told that: "if he was 15 or 16 he could come down  to
       London, but if he was younger he would have to stay  in  Manchester,
       so he reports he lied about his age, saying he was 15  when  he  was
       13, as he thought London was better than Manchester".

   48. I accept that MRA felt deeply uncomfortable  about  maintaining  the
       2000 dob but was very confused and afraid of  the  consequences  for
       him if he reverted to the 2003 dob.  In addition to  this,  MRA  was
       not  assisted  by  the  Defendant  or  Mr  Nazemi  in  ensuring  his
       immigration solicitors had all the relevant information they  should
       have had during this vital period  (August  to  December  2016).   I
       accept  MRA's  evidence  that  he  felt  guilty  and   upset   about
       maintaining a date of birth that was contrary to the 2003 dob to his
       immigration solicitors, the Home Office and  other  agencies  during
       this period.  I accept he felt powerless and scared.  I accept  that
       he has therefore been able to credibly explain  why  he  omitted  to
       tell his immigration solicitors and other agencies  about  the  2003
       dob, until his disclosure in April 2017.

   49. MRA continued to rely upon the 2003 dob after he was transferred  on
       4 May 2017 to the Priory in Manchester.  Whilst at the  Priory,  MRA
       disclosed to staff that his true  age  was  the  one  he  gave  upon
       arrival i.e. the 2003 dob.  The Priory discharge  letter  summarises
       MRA's circumstances in Iran and gives ages that would be  consistent
       with the 2000 dob but makes  the  following  clear  "of  note  [MRA]
       claims to be  younger  than  the  age  assigned  to  him  by  social
       services".  During the course of the age  assessment  interview  MRA
       highlighted that he gave his "real age" to the Priory.  I accept his
       evidence that by this he meant the 2003 dob.  In addition,  although
       Dr Rajpal recorded the 2000 dob in his report, at 5.6 he states: "He
       reported that his social worker has got his date of birth wrong  and
       his is currently 15 years old rather than 18".

   50. On the day of his discharge from the Priory on  28  September  2017,
       MRA contacted the Defendant to inform his social worker that his age
       had been incorrectly recorded.  The social care notes record MRA  as
       being "very upset" that the doctors at the Priory gave him  a  wrong
       date of birth.  I accept that from this  point  MRA  maintained  the
       2003 dob as much as he felt able to do so.  On 11 November  2017  he
       gave the police the 2003 dob.   Each  of  the  witnesses  called  on
       behalf of MRA provided evidence that they have always known his  age
       by reference to the 2003 dob.  The  practical  reality  was  however
       different.  MRA's official record was changed in late April 2016 and
       for all formal purposes he was assigned the 2000 dob.  The fact that
       MRA's GP, 'Off the Record', the Priory and Dr  Rajpal  all  recorded
       MRA's date of  birth  as  the  2000  dob  provides  me  with  little
       assistance in these circumstances.   As  I  indicated  to  Mr  Paget
       during the hearing, save for the 'Off the Record' notes for  October
       2016, there is nothing from the body of those documents to  indicate
       that MRA gave the 2000 dob, as opposed to this merely reflecting the
       official record.  Rather, some of the documents I have  referred  to
       above support MRA's claim that he tried to give what he  claimed  to
       be his 'true' dob.  Mr Paget invited me to  note  that  the  history
       recorded by  'Off  the  Record',  a  youth  counselling  charity  in
       Croydon, in October 2016 provides a summary of MRA's  background  by
       referring to ages consistent with the 2000 dob.  MRA however  wholly
       accepted that around this time he was  consistently  maintaining  to
       everyone (including 'Off the Record') that he was  15  and  this  is
       merely reflective of his misguided approach to his age at this time.
        For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Paget applied to recall MRA  on  the
       third day of the hearing, prior to closing submissions, to  ask  him
       questions about what he said to 'Off the Record'.   I  refused  that
       application because it was made way too late and in any event  could
       be addressed in submissions.

   51. In order for MRA's education record to be consistent with  the  2003
       dob he would have had to skip  three  school  years  in  Iran.   MRA
       plausibly explained that his mother was a teacher  and  he  and  his
       family were ambitious regarding his education.   The  Defendant  has
       not directly disputed the plausibility of this  claim  and  has  not
       sought to adduce any  country  background  information  on  Iran  to
       undermine it.  Mr Paget focussed his criticism  of  this  aspect  of
       MRA's evidence upon his failure to  make  it  clear  in  his  asylum
       statement or when summarising his education to medical professionals
       that he skipped three years.  I accept MRA's explanation that at the
       relevant times he was only asked for a  summary  of  his  education.
       The account of  his  educational  history  in  Iran  in  his  asylum
       statement and in the psychiatric report  are  brief.   Although  not
       relied upon by Mr Paget, MRA's claim that he has been ambitious  and
       worked hard at school in Iran may  at  first  glance  appear  to  be
       inconsistent with his educational record in the UK.  He has not been
       in education for some time.  The reasons for  this  are  complicated
       and interconnected.  MRA has suffered a significant  mental  illness
       over a sustained period.  The lead up to this and its aftermath have
       clearly impacted upon his education.  I acknowledge that MRA has  at
       times refused placements.  However, as Mrs Maclure observed the most
       recent refusal occurred at a very difficult  time  for  MRA  and  he
       simply did not have the necessary mindset to press  ahead  with  it.
       MRA's ambitions to continue his education  have  been  difficult  to
       achieve in the UK, when he has prioritised other basic issues in his
       life such  as  his  mental  health  and  accommodation.   There  was
       considerable credible evidence that  notwithstanding  these  matters
       and the failure to take up education options, MRA  has  demonstrated
       the ability and ambition to pursue  his  education.   This  was  the
       evidence of both Mr Nazemi, his foster carer for the year  to  April
       2017 and Mr Cisse, his advocate from December 2017.   When  all  the
       evidence is considered in the round, I accept that it is more likely
       than not that MRA skipped three school years in Iran.

   52. I now turn to more general aspects of MRA's credibility relied  upon
       by the Defendant.  Mr Paget invited me to find that MRA has provided
       scant information about his personal history in Iran and his  escape
       from that country.  When his mental health history and young age (on
       any view) leaving Iran unaccompanied are taken into  account,  MRA's
       description of his life in Iran and the circumstances  in  which  he
       left Iran, together with his limited contact  with  family  in  Iran
       whilst in the UK, is relatively comprehensive and has  been  broadly
       consistent.  This consistency has been maintained over the course of
       his three years in the UK and in relation to different agencies  and
       individuals.  I acknowledge that there  has  been  some  uncertainty
       about contact with family members in Iran.  However,  the  Applicant
       has been broadly consistent that he only had  limited  contact  with
       his family via 'facebook messenger'.  If, as MRA claims, his  family
       members were caught illegally exiting Iran, it is entirely plausible
       that they would have been detained and contact would have been  very
       difficult.  I note that the Secretary of State  has  rejected  MRA's
       asylum claim and the credibility of his claim will be determined  by
       the First-tier Tribunal.  The evidence  before  that  Tribunal  will
       have a very different emphasis.  However,  the  evidence  before  me
       relevant to MRA's asylum claim, seems credible and plausible in  the
       context  of  Iran,  notwithstanding   the   Secretary   of   State's
       observations to the contrary in his decision letter.

Other witnesses

   53. I have already touched upon  the  evidence  provided  by  the  other
       witnesses above.  I need  only  summarise  my  assessment  of  their
       evidence.  Mr Paget invited me  to  find  that  the  'observational'
       evidence provided  by  these  witnesses  was  inherently  vague  and
       subjective.  I have attached weight to the evidence provided by  all
       of MRA's witnesses who  have  extensive  experience  of  working  or
       interacting with children of all ages and know MRA well.  In my view
       this applies to all the witnesses save for Mr Hawes.  They  provided
       credible evidence of  value  obtained  from  observations  of  MRA's
       interaction with others over long and varying periods of time.  They
       have had the opportunity to observe MRA when he was going about  his
       ordinary life in a natural setting and in  environments  comfortable
       to him.  They have been able to point to consistent attitudes, and a
       number of supporting instances over a considerable period  of  time,
       entirely supportive of  the  2003  dob.   Significantly,  they  were
       prepared  to  acknowledge  that  MRA  has  at   times   demonstrated
       characteristics tending to support maturity and an  older  age  than
       claimed, but overall presented with the 2003 dob.

   54. Mr Paget also invited me to  find  that  MRA  demonstrated  a  bold,
       mature and confident outlook more reflective of an older  child,  on
       many occasions.  I acknowledge that there have been examples of this
       but they are very much outweighed by many more examples of  a  timid
       child acting consistently with  the  2003  dob,  who  has  regularly
       sought out the support of adults in whom he placed trust.

   55. The witnesses were all very confident that MRA is much  more  likely
       to be 15 than 18.  They gave cogent reasons for this.  However it is
       the detailed observations  from  these  witnesses  and  the  telling
       examples they gave that  have  provided  me  with  most  assistance,
       rather than their own assessments of MRA's age.

   56. The evidence from the witnesses involved in 'Play for Progress'  was
       striking because they were each able to draw on  specific  examples.
       Their evidence was consistent with Mrs Hamid's witness statement  in
       so far as they agreed that  without  appropriate  support  and  when
       placed in an environment he is  not  comfortable  in,  MRA  displays
       behaviour that can be difficult to manage.  They were  however  able
       to draw on many more examples to  support  MRA  acting  consistently
       with the 2003 dob and in a manner more  reflective  of  other  young
       people his age, when placed in group situations.

   57. Mrs Maclure provided  very  helpful  and  straightforward  evidence.
       Although she has been MRA's foster carer for just over  two  months,
       and therefore significantly shorter  time  than  Mr  Nazemi  or  Mrs
       Hamid, she provided a very full picture of MRA's  interactions  with
       others.  I accept that she is in a good position to do  so.   Unlike
       his previous foster placements, MRA has spent a great deal  of  time
       at home with the Maclure family and is comfortable  and  happy  with
       them.  They demonstrated trust in him and in turn  he  trusts  them.
       The entire family do many activities together including Church on  a
       Sunday, games, football, running and dog walking.  I entirely accept
       Mrs Maclure's detailed observations and examples in support  of  her
       observation that MRA behaved in a  manner  more  consistent  with  a
       'young' 15-year-old rather than an older teenager.    Mrs  Maclure's
       evidence was consistent with the evidence provided  by  her  husband
       Reverend Maclure.  I accept Mr Cisse's evidence  that  MRA  did  not
       wish to attend college because he  considered  that  would  be  "too
       adult" and he just wanted  to  "fit  in"  to  a  school.   This  was
       consistent with the evidence provided by the Maclures.

   58. I was particularly impressed with the candid and revealing  evidence
       provided by Ms Macdonald, MRA's 'godmother' at HTB.   Although  they
       only met in September 2018, I accept her evidence that they  quickly
       formed a close and trusting relationship.   It  must  have  assisted
       that they were able to speak openly and freely in Farsi, and  shared
       a deep interest in Christianity.  Ms Macdonald acknowledged that MRA
       displayed a number of mature behaviours but when he  let  his  guard
       down to those he trusted, he came across as an emotional  and  needy
       younger person who consistently sought consolation and  advice  from
       adults  including  herself.   She  also  explained  that   generally
       speaking, in Iranian culture children were generally expected to  be
       more reserved and private, and this  would  explain  some  of  MRA's
       behaviours.

   59. Mrs Hamid's description of MRA when she acted as  his  foster-parent
       is strikingly different to the account provided by the Maclures.  It
       seems that MRA did not get along with Mrs Hamid and  did  not  trust
       her.  She experienced MRA mainly when his guard  was  up.   For  the
       reasons I have provided above this did not necessarily  reflect  his
       whole character or his genuine attitude to important issues or other
       people, which have been more revealing when he is in an  environment
       he is comfortable in and amongst people he trusts.

   60. I have attached very little weight to the evidence provided  by  the
       Defendant's three witnesses who gave  oral  evidence.   Ms  Gouveia-
       Schofield was  the  only  social  worker  who  gave  evidence.   Her
       statement and oral  evidence  predominantly  focussed  on  the  more
       negative sides  of  MRA's  behaviour  and  did  not  strive  in  any
       meaningful manner to provide a rounded picture of MRA.  She provided
       unclear and contradictory evidence for the reasons  outlined  in  Ms
       Hafesji's  closing  written  submissions  at  [26]  to  [29].     In
       addition, she was either unwilling or  unable  to  accept  that  the
       delay in carrying out an age assessment of MRA was regrettable  (see
       below) and there was contradictory evidence from her on the need for
       an age assessment at all.

   61. It remains  entirely  unclear  why  the  Defendant  relied  upon  Mr
       Nazemi's evidence when he did not support the  Defendant's  position
       that the 2000 dob should be accepted.  In his evidence  he  made  it
       clear that he believed MRA to be between 23 and  27,  some  five  to
       nine years more than the 2000 dob.  His reasoning for this  and  the
       extent to which he has been able to reliably account  for  his  time
       with MRA was entirely unsatisfactory for the reasons set out  in  Ms
       Hafesji's closing written submissions at [30] to [33].

   62. Mr Goodwin accepted  that  he  only  met  MRA  once  and  based  his
       assessment of MRA's age entirely upon his appearance and  demeanour,
       and MRA's demeanour as reported to him  by  another  member  of  the
       Church.  I attach very little weight to his assessment of MRA's age.



   63. Ms Dumanski  is  a  social  worker  employed  by  the  Priory.   Her
       statement was not disputed but her view on MRA's age  was  based  on
       appearance and what she had been told by others.


Age assessment

   64. It is  noteworthy  that  although  there  were  several  notes  made
       regarding the need for an age assessment from April 2016,  this  did
       not take place until June  2018.   Ms  Gouveia-Schofield  sought  to
       explain this by indicating that the Defendant was more focussed upon
       MRA's mental health.  Unfortunately, there was no clear  recognition
       on the part of Ms Gouveia-Schofield that it was important  both  for
       MRA's mental health and other  reasons  relating  to  identity,  the
       services provided to MRA and his asylum claim, to have the issue  of
       his age fairly and comprehensively resolved  promptly.   MRA  should
       have been given a far earlier formal opportunity to explore  crucial
       matters relevant to his age.  The social care notes record  numerous
       instances from April 2016 when the Defendant initially made it clear
       that an age assessment should be carried out before then maintaining
       that it was unnecessary.  There were also numerous requests for  the
       matter of age to be properly resolved - see in particular  the  note
       from  20  November  2017  in  which  Mr  Russell  records  that  the
       difference in ages provided are significant  and  MRA's  residential
       unit (at the time this was Trent Valley House) feels strong that MRA
       should be given an age assessment.  Yet,  I  was  provided  with  no
       cogent explanation for the failure to undertake  an  age  assessment
       until Osbornes were instructed in 2018.

   65. I have considered the statements and written evidence provided by Mr
       Mercer and Mr Russell together with the Defendant's  age  assessment
       itself.  In my judgment the age assessment is  significantly  flawed
       as  it  failed  to  take  into  account  highly  material   matters,
       particularly the role played by  the  significant  deterioration  in
       MRA's mental health and his detailed evidence as to how he knew  his
       age and why he changed it  -  see  the  reasons  identified  in  the
       judicial review grounds at  [46]  to  [77].   These  have  not  been
       adequately addressed  in  the  Defendant's  summary  grounds,  which
       merely deny these matters at [13]-[14].  I also accept Ms  Hafesji's
       submission that Mr Russell inaccurately and unfairly suggested  that
       MRA acknowledged during the age assessment process that he had  been
       coached or advised to give an age prior to coming to  the  UK,  when
       the contemporaneous notes provide no support  for  this  whatsoever.
       Those notes confirm MRA acknowledging that he was advised to give  a
       different name only.  For the reasons provided at [41]  to  [45]  of
       the grounds, the age assessment contains a  mistake  of  fact  on  a
       material issue that has caused unfairness.  The Defendant has merely
       denied this without more.  In  addition,  although  Mr  Russell  was
       MRA's allocated social  worker,  he  did  not  have  his  trust  and
       confidence,  and  the  relationship  was  a  difficult  one.   This,
       together with the failure to hold a 'minded to' meeting renders  the
       age assessment process procedurally unfair for the reasons  provided
       in the judicial review grounds at [37] to [38].  The social  workers
       involved  in  this  age  assessment  do  not  appear  to  have  much
       experience of age assessments.   Whilst  some  age  assessments  may
       prove decisive, this is not one.  In all the circumstances I am  not
       prepared to give weight to  the  age  assessment  or  to  the  views
       expressed by Mr Mercer and Mr Russell.

Other evidence

   66. In assessing MRA's age, both parties acknowledged that there can, in
       adolescents,  be  considerable  differences  in  physical  maturity,
       height, weight, behavioural maturity  and  educational  ability,  so
       that those characteristics taken by themselves are  not  a  reliable
       indicator of a person's exact age.   As the Upper Tribunal  (Mr  CMG
       Ockelton, Vice-President and UTJ Lane) observed in R (AM) v Solihull
       MBC CO/2467/2011  "almost all evidence of  physical  characteristics
       is likely to be of very limited value" given that "there is no clear
       relationship between chronological  age  and  physical  maturity  in
       respect of most measurable aspects of such maturity".   Reliance  on
       physical  appearance  and  demeanour  are   notoriously   unreliable
       indicators of a teenager's age.  This applies to height measurements
       as well.  During the course of cross-examination of  MRA,  Mr  Paget
       relied upon a height chart that recorded MRA's  height  in  November
       2016.  I attach little weight to this.  Mr Paget accepted the height
       chart reflected boys' heights in the UK, and made  no  reference  to
       any evidence relating to height or physical appearance,  during  his
       closing submissions.

   67. In any event, assuming there was no increase in  MRA's  height  does
       not necessarily mean that he is younger or older than claimed.  That
       a young person may experience growth spurts at  different  times  is
       uncontroversial.  MRA looks relatively physically mature, but so  do
       many 15-year-olds.
Conclusion
   68. Drawing all of this together, and doing the best I can on the  basis
       of the evidence available and the analysis of it that I have carried
       out, I reach the clear and firm conclusion that MRA's date of  birth
       is that which he initially claimed upon arrival in the UK  and  then
       continued to rely upon from the end of April 2017 to date  i.e.  the
       2003 dob.  I make a declaration that MRA was born on 23  June  2003.
       That means that he was 12 when he arrived in the UK, 14 at the  date
       of the age assessment and 15 now.
Observations

   69. I decline to make the observations requested by  Ms  Hafesji  during
       the course of her closing submissions.  The Defendant will no  doubt
       reflect on the findings I  have  set  out  above,  with  a  view  to
       improving their general approach to age  disputed  children  in  the
       future, as well as to MRA.  In addition,  given  what  has  happened
       over the last three years, the Defendant will need to be  pro-active
       in re-building a relationship of trust and confidence with  MRA.   I
       am confident that with the support of his  foster  parents  and  the
       Defendant, MRA should be able to return to education  that  respects
       his wishes and feelings.  This is likely to be pivotal  to  securing
       MRA's best interests, and urgent consideration should  be  given  to
       prioritising this.

Costs

   70. The issue of costs, and any other applications, will be heard by  me
       on Tuesday 14 May 2019 at 9.45am only if no  agreement  is  reached;
       the parties to provide written submissions limited to three sides of
       A4 by 12 noon on Wednesday 8 May 2019.
