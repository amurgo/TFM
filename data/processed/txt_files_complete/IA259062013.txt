                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.     The  Secretary  of  State  appeals  with   permission   against   the
    determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Nightingale.  For  ease
    following this judgment I shall refer to the parties in the same format
    as they  were  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  although  Mr  ND  is  the
    Respondent to this application.

2.    The Appellant is a citizen of Trinidad and  Tobago.  He  had  appealed
    against the decision of the Secretary of State to remove  him  pursuant
    to Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 after he had  made
    an application for leave to remain based on him having  a  family  life
    with a British partner.

3.    The Respondent, the Secretary of State, had  refused  the  application
    because it was said that the Appellant's presence in the United Kingdom
    was not conducive to the public good and that  his  conduct,  character
    and associations made it is undesirable for him to remain in the United
    Kingdom.

4.    The Secretary of State appeals on two  grounds.  It  is  said  firstly
    that the judge made a material misdirection in law and, secondly,  that
    paragraph EX1 of the Immigration Rules was not lawfully  considered  in
    respect of insurmountable obstacles. Having heard  the  submissions  of
    the parties and having considered the written documents  including  the
    Secretary of State's grounds and the Appellant's skeleton argument this
    is my extempore decision which I have given in court today.  I given an
    extempore determination, not least, because I am of the view  that  the
    Appellant and his wife, along with the Secretary  of  State  should  be
    able to hear as soon as possible what the outcome  of  the  application
    made in 2013 ought to be.

5.    It is of course quite clear that the grounds  that  the  Secretary  of
    State has lodged have to  satisfy  the  requirement  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal's decision in R (Iran) v Secretary of State [2005] INLR 633.  It
    is quite clear that mere disagreement with the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge's decision is not  enough.   There  has  to  be  an
    identifiable error of law and that error of law  has  to  be  material.
    That is a decision of the Court of Appeal of some standing. My task  is
    not to rehear the original appeal.

6.    I therefore turn to the grounds  of  appeal.  They  are  detailed  and
    rather repetitive and in the circumstances perhaps paragraph 1F of  the
    Secretary of State's grounds summarise the position where it states:

         "Therefore the SSHD asserts that the A's conduct is undesirable for
         several  reasons  including  his  poor  immigration  history,   his
         willingness to lie to  immigration  officials,  his  disregard  for
         immigration control by bringing a person into the  UK  on  a  false
         premise, the reason why and their present status  do  not  mitigate
         the initial action on the A's part. His convictions in the  UK  and
         his convictions in Trinidad and Tobago."

7.    Ground 2 can be summarised by reference to paragraph 2B  which  states
    as follows:

         "The  SSHD  respectfully  submits  that  the  FTJ's  assessment  of
         insurmountable  obstacles   is   fundamentally   flawed.    British
         citizenship is not in itself a trump card. The factors relied  upon
         are indicative of the ordinary hardships  a  person  will  face  in
         relocating to another country. It is reasonable to suppose that the
         A's partner would have to make a choice between her career, her  UK
         home and her family ties if she  wishes  to  continue  to  enjoy  a
         relationship with the A who is subject to immigration control."

8.    I then turn to the First Tier Tribunal's determination. It  is  to  be
    noted from the outset that the determination of the judge  was  a  very
    detailed one with specific and detailed reference to the evidence  that
    she had considered, both oral and written, and indeed she had also  set
    out and considered the submissions of the respective parties.

9.    Of course it is right to note that the length of  a  determination  is
    not necessarily an indication of accuracy or indeed of care in decision
    making, but I agree with Upper Tribunal  Judge  McGeachy's  observation
    when  he  granted  permission  to  appeal  in  this   case   that   the
    determination is indeed  a  thoughtful  one.   I  have  considered  the
    numerous paragraphs in which the  First-tier  Tribunal  considered  the
    evidence. She clearly had in  mind  the  Appellant's  poor  immigration
    history and that he had been in the United Kingdom unlawfully for  many
    years. She also noted, however, that the  seriousness  with  which  the
    Appellant's offending was to be viewed had in fact been based  in  part
    on an incorrect premise.  This incorrect premise was an important  part
    of the case. It considerably affected the approach  to  the  case.  The
    incorrect premise was acknowledged during the Respondent's case  before
    her.

10.   The judge had said at paragraph 60 of her decision as follows:

         "I have considered the evidence before me in the  round,  and  with
         care. I am indebted to Mr Williams who in my  view,  very  sensibly
         and quite rightly, accepted the Appellant's account with regard  to
         events in Trinidad and Tobago.  I am equally indebted to  Detective
         Constable  Scutt  for  his  frank  admission  that  but   for   the
         information provided from Trinidad and Tobago this would not  be  a
         'Nexus' case,  and  the  Appellant's  UK  offending  would  not  be
         considered to be serious enough to engage  his  department.  It  is
         therefore of note that the serious nature of the matters said to be
         outstanding against this Appellant in Trinidad, at  page  5  of  DC
         Scutt's  statement  are  now  accepted   the   Respondent   to   be
         considerably less serious than first thought.  Certainly, I find it
         doubtful that DC Scutt's department, and all the expense which that
         involvement entails, would have been engaged if  the  circumstances
         as are now accepted had been known at  that  time.  Nonetheless,  I
         have considered his evidence with care  and,  in  particular,  that
         relating to  conduct  rather  than  the  simple  fact  of  criminal
         convictions."

11.   Additionally it is said at paragraph 11 of the determination

         "In  cross-examination,  he  [Detective   Scutt]   explained   that
         Operation Nexus had now come under the umbrella of the Serious  and
         Organised Crime Command. Someone from the  Home  Office  would  ask
         somebody at Nexus to make enquiries about an  individual.   He  had
         simply collated any references to the Appellant held  on  computer.
         He had never had any individual dealings with the Appellant. He had
         never questioned, arrested, charged or interrogated  the  Appellant
         himself. All of the information was from the computer."

12.   The offences themselves in relation  to  Trinidad  are  set  out,  for
    example, at paragraph 18 where the  Appellant  was  described  then  as
    being 16 years of age, at school.  He had been doing some metal work in
    school and it is said he was being young and foolish. He was dealt with
    for having an imitation fire arm.  It was not a functioning gun. He was
    arrested and then fined the equivalent of ï¿½550 sterling and  this  fine
    was to be paid off by the Appellant's mother.

13.   Therefore looking at this evidence and the way  in  which  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge was looking at it, it is quite clear to me that the
    judge noted that what was now being put by the Secretary of  State  was
    different to  that  compared  with  the  original  decision.  The  oral
    evidence of the police detective and a concession by the Home Office at
    the hearing had significantly changed the seriousness of the  case  and
    the way in which it was to  be  viewed.   Deplorable  as  any  criminal
    conduct is, the judge was plainly entitled to come to  the  views  that
    she did.  Her views were clearly reasoned and  explained.  This  is  an
    important part of the case and in the way  in  which  the  Respondent's
    appeal has to be viewed.

14.   As Mr Norton has indicated during the hearing today, he relies on  the
    factors in respect of LTR.1.6 of Appendix FM but not now on LTR1.5.  In
    my view that approach is the right and indeed the sensible approach  in
    terms of the seriousness which was once being suggested.  But  it  also
    indicates the way in which the judge herself had viewed the case  as  a
    result of the evidence which was put forward.

15.   In relation to this ground I conclude that I can see no error  of  law
    which can be said to arise, let alone for it to be said that there  was
    a material error of law.  The judge's reasoning  in  my  judgement  was
    impeccable.  True it is that perhaps others might not necessarily  have
    come to the view that the judge did,  but  as  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    decision in R (Iran)  makes  abundantly  clear,  and  as  a  number  of
    decisions since then make clear, mere disagreement with a determination
    is not sufficient to  enable  a  successful  challenge  to  be  brought
    against the decision of the judge.

Insurmountable Obstacles

16.   I turn then to the second ground.  In my judgement  this  ground  must
    also fail because there is a failure to identify a  material  error  of
    law.  The Respondent's grounds in reality have rephrased the case which
    was put at the hearing before the judge.   It  is  plain  to  see  from
    numerous paragraphs including at paragraphs 81 and 83 that  First  tier
    Tribunal clearly had in mind  both  the  correct  law  in  relation  to
    insurmountable obstacles but also that the correct factual  matrix  was
    applied in a careful, reasoned and balanced manner.  The Tribunal noted
    that the Appellant's partner has British citizenship.  The Tribunal did
    not view that, contrary to what is said in  the  grounds,  as  being  a
    "trump card". However the First tier Tribunal  was  clearly  unable  to
    ignore the significant matters referred to, for example at paragraph 83
    of the decision that the Appellant's  partner's  wife's  education  has
    been here in the United Kingdom.  She  has  a  career  with  the  civil
    service.  She has had a mortgage which now only has eight years left to
    pay, her own children are here. They have grandchildren and  she  is  a
    carer for those grandchildren.  The public  interest  was  not  lightly
    dismissed  or  side  lined.  It  featured  as  a  very  important   and
    significant factor.

17.   The findings by the First-tier Tribunal Judge were not  suggestive  of
    there being a single issue which would  enable  her  to  conclude  that
    there were insurmountable obstacle. She took a whole range  of  factors
    into account and came to the decision which she did.

18.   In my judgment she was entitled to come to the decision that she  did.



19.   In the circumstances  noting  too  the  particular  basis  upon  which
    permission to appeal was granted, namely the Appellant's overstaying, I
    can see that this was also specifically considered by the  judge.   She
    did so at paragraphs 76, 77  and  80.   She  took  those  factors  into
    account in both respects in relation to both parts of  the  grounds  of
    appeal.

20.   In the circumstances, looking at the grounds individually  and  indeed
    cumulatively I conclude that there is no material error of law  in  the
    judge's decision.

21.   Accordingly, for the reasons I have outlined I do not find that  there
    is a material error of law in the First tier  Tribunal's  decision  and
    therefore the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision  stands  whereby  Mr
    ND's appeal had been allowed.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.

I make an anonymity direction order.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 13 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-
tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
