                      MR C M G OCKELTON, VICE PRESIDENT

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr L C Mbaeyi of Victory@Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. We were not invited to continue the anonymity  direction  made  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Given that the appellant is now an adult  and  no
    longer a child, we see no basis to justify continuing or making such an
    order in this appeal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of St Vincent & the Grenadines who was  born
    on 18 February 1996.  On 5 August 2013 the appellant arrived in the  UK
    and was granted a six month visit visa expiring on 5 February 2014.  On
    17 February 2014, she applied for indefinite leave  to  remain  as  the
    child of a person, namely her father (the sponsor) Mr Gerald Horne  who
    has indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

 3. On 13  May  2014,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    application under para 298 and Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC
    395 as amended) and Art 8 of the ECHR.  On 15 May 2014,  the  Secretary
    of State made a decision to remove the appellant as an overstayer to St
    Vincent & the Grenadines  by  way  of  directions  under  s.10  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
    heard by Judge Y J Jones and, in  a  determination  promulgated  on  20
    October 2014, Judge Jones dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal.   Before
    Judge Jones, the appellant's representative accepted that the appellant
    could not meet the requirements of the Rules including para 276ADE.  He
    relied exclusively upon Art 8 of the ECHR.  Judge Jones did not  accept
    that the appellant and sponsor were related as claimed and consequently
    dismissed the appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 5. The appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    principally on the basis that the judge had been wrong to conclude that
    the appellant had not established that the sponsor was her  father  and
    that, therefore, "family life" did  not  exist  between  them  for  the
    purposes of Art 8.

 6. Permission was initially refused by the First-tier Tribunal but  on  23
    March 2015 the Upper Tribunal (DUTJ McWilliam)  granted  permission  on
    that ground.

 7. Thus, the appeal came before us.

Discussion

 8. Mr Mbaeyi, who represented the appellant,  relied  on  the  appellant's
    grounds.  In addition, he sought to argue that the appellant could,  in
    fact, rely upon the Immigration Rules, in particular para  298  dealing
    with an application for indefinite leave to remain  by  a  child  of  a
    parent settled in the UK.  He submitted that it was  not  crucial  that
    the appellant had reached the age of  18,  after  her  application  was
    made, by the time of the respondent's decision.

 9. That argument is, in our judgment, hopeless.  Para 298(ii) sets out  as
    follows one of the requirements which the  appellant  must  satisfy  in
    order to succeed in an application  for  settlement,  namely  that  the
    person:

         "(ii)    has or has had limited leave to enter  or  remain  in  the
             United Kingdom, and

             (a)  is under the age of 18; or

             (b)  was given leave  to  enter  or  remain  with  a  view  to
                  settlement under paragraph 302 or Appendix FM; or

             (c)  was admitted into the UK  in  accordance  with  paragraph
                  319R and has completed a period of two years limited leave
                  as a child of a refugee  or  beneficiary  of  humanitarian
                  protection who is now present and settled in the UK or  as
                  the  child  of  a  former  refugee   or   beneficiary   of
                  humanitarian protection who is now a British Citizen, or

             (d)  the applicant has limited leave to enter or remain in the
                  United Kingdom in accordance with paragraph 319X,  as  the
                  child of a relative with limited  leave  to  remain  as  a
                  refugee or beneficiary of humanitarian protection  in  the
                  United Kingdom and who is now present and settled here; or

             (e)  was last given limited leave to  remain  under  paragraph
                  298A; ..."

10.  The  relevant  date  to  determine  whether  the  appellant  met   the
    requirements of para 298 is the  date  of  the  respondent's  decision.
    That is clear from the decision of the House of Lords in Odelola v SSHD
    [2009] UKHL  25;  [2010]  Imm  AR  59  despite  Mr  Mbaeyi's  confessed
    ignorance of that  decision.   The  requirements  in  (a)  to  (e)  are
    alternatives.  At the date of the respondent's decision, namely 15  May
    2014, the appellant had reached her eighteenth  birthday.   She  could,
    therefore, not meet the requirement in para 298(ii)(a) as being  "under
    the age of 18".  Likewise, and it was not suggested to the contrary  by
    Mr Mbaeyi, the appellant had not been granted leave to enter or  remain
    under any of the provisions set out in para 298(ii)(b)-(e).  Her  leave
    was as a visitor under para 41 of the Rule and that leave does not fall
    within any of sub-paragraphs (b) to (e).  There is no doubt, therefore,
    that the appellant could not succeed under para 298.

11. Mr Mbaeyi did not seek to press before us the appellant's  claim  under
    para 276ADE.  That, no doubt,  underlay  his  acceptance  before  Judge
    Jones that the appellant could not succeed under  the  Rules  including
    para 276ADE.  Taking, as para 276ADE(1) requires, the  appellant's  age
    "at the date of application", as she was at that time "under the age of
    18 years" she would have to show that under para 276ADE(1)(iv) that she
    had "lived continuously in the  UK  for  at  least  seven  years",  and
    patently could not do so.  She had been in the UK for  only  just  over
    six months.  Further, if her age was taken to be between 18  years  and
    25 years, then she would have to establish under para 276ADE(1)(v) that
    she had "spent at least half of her life  living  continuously  in  the
    UK", and again patently could not do so.  Judge Jones  was,  therefore,
    in our view, entirely correct to consider the appellant's  claim  under
    Art 8 on the basis that she could not satisfy any  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

12. Turning now to Judge Jones's decision to dismiss the appeal  under  Art
    8, her decision rests principally upon her finding that  the  appellant
    had not established that the sponsor was her father.  As a consequence,
    it was not established that there was "family life" between them.   The
    judge's reasoning is at paras 23-28 as follows:

         "23. The first matter to consider  is  whether  the  appellant  has
             established a private and/or family life in the  UK  with  the
             sponsor.   The  appellant's  application  was  submitted   and
             received  on  17  February  2014,  one  day  before  her  18th
             birthday.  At  the  date  of  the  application  therefore  the
             appellant was a minor and had been in the UK for a  period  of
             just over six months.  The evidence of both the appellant  and
             the sponsor is that the appellant has  never  lived  with  the
             sponsor until she came to the UK.  She last  remembers  seeing
             him when she was about 5 when she was living with  her  mother
             in St Vincent and the sponsor confirmed that he last  saw  her
             eleven or twelve years ago.  It appears that over that  period
             of time the appellant and the sponsor were in sporadic contact
             and more recently in contact via Skype.  There is no  evidence
             before me of any consistent contact between the appellant  and
             sponsor until she came to the UK.

         24.  I am concerned by the  paucity  of  evidence  to  support  the
             claimed relationship between the sponsor  and  the  appellant.
             The birth certificate produced does not name  the  sponsor  as
             her father and there is no independent  evidence  produced  to
             confirm the relationship.  Although there are medical  letters
             sent from  the  British  Virgin  Islands  in  respect  of  the
             appellant's mother there is no confirmation from her that  the
             sponsor is the father of the appellant.  At the  very  end  of
             the hearing letters from Cellmark were produced by  Mr  Mbaeyi
             and they showed that an appointment had been made  for  a  DNA
             test to take place, however the sponsor has confirmed that the
             test has been  cancelled  and  no  payment  made  because  the
             appointment date was after the date of the  hearing.   As  has
             been said the appellant was 17� when she came to the UK and is
             now 18�.

         25.  It was put to the appellant during the hearing  that  she  had
             contacted the Home Office  twice  since  the  refusal  of  her
             application to remain in the UK  for  help  to  return  to  St
             Vincent and the Grenadines.  She confirmed that she  had  made
             such contact as she could not  endure  "the  stress"  and  was
             suffering  from  migraines.   She  also  confirmed  that   she
             cancelled the proposed arrangement with  the  Home  Office  to
             leave.  However the fact that she contacted  the  Home  Office
             twice to return to  St  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  I  find
             undermines her claim now to wish to remain in the UK with  the
             sponsor.  I therefore find that on the basis of  the  evidence
             before me she has not  established  a  family  life  with  the
             sponsor.  It has been emphasised by  her  representative  that
             her application was as a minor and as such I find that she has
             not established an independent private life in the UK  in  the
             short time that she has been here.  The appellant was a  minor
             when her application was made and her welfare  is  my  primary
             consideration.

         26.  I have considered Section 117B inserted into the  Nationality,
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in July this year and  I  note
             that the appellant's claimed  family  and  private  life  were
             established in part when  the  appellant  was  in  the  United
             Kingdom  unlawfully  and  when  her  immigration  status   was
             precarious.  I find that the appellant  is  not  a  qualifying
             child for the purposes of Section 117 as she is not a  British
             citizen and  has  not  lived  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
             continuous period of seven years or more.

         27.  I do find the appellant to be a credible witness  and  I  find
             that she has given her evidence honestly.  However there is no
             independent evidence that she is related to the sponsor.   Her
             mother has not confirmed that the sponsor is her father.   She
             still has relatives in St Vincent and the  Grenadines,  namely
             her sister who is aged 22 and her great-grandmother who  lives
             with  relatives.   I  am  not  satisfied  on  the  balance  of
             probabilities that on the evidence before me  the  sponsor  is
             the appellant's biological father.

         28.  Taking all these circumstances into account I  find  that  the
             appellant has not established a family  life  in  the  UK  and
             therefore  cannot  succeed  under  Article  8  of   the   1950
             Convention.  There is  no  need  to  consider  proportionality
             Article 8 is not engaged by this appellant's claim."

13. As we expressed at the hearing, we have some concerns about the judge's
    adverse finding that the appellant and sponsor were not related as they
    claimed.

14. First, it does not seem to have formed any part  of  the  Secretary  of
    State's case before the judge that the appellant was not  the  daughter
    of the sponsor.  That point was not raised in the refusal letter of  13
    May 2014 and is not recorded as  an  issue  raised  by  the  Presenting
    Officer in the summary of his submissions at paras 18-19 of the judge's
    determination.  The thrust of those latter submissions would appear  to
    be that the appellant could not meet the requirements of the Rules  and
    it was not disproportionate for her to return to  St  Vincent  and  the
    Grenadines.

15. That said, we can see from the determination that Mr Mbaeyi  on  behalf
    of the appellant was  at  least  alive  to  the  possibility  that  the
    appellant's relationship with the sponsor might be an issue.  Thus, DNA
    testing had been arranged  with  Cellmark  but,  at  the  hearing,  the
    sponsor indicated that that was not going ahead as the appointment  was
    not until after the appeal hearing and, in effect, there was  no  point
    in incurring the cost of over �388 in the light of that.

16. Nevertheless, we are left uneasy that the matter was not fully explored
    at the hearing in order that the appellant could seek  to  substantiate
    her claim to be the daughter of the sponsor.  It would have  been  open
    to the appellant to seek an adjournment of  the  proceedings  in  order
    that a DNA test could be undertaken with Cellmark.

17. Secondly, we were told that the sponsor had some considerable time  ago
    when making his own application for leave included the appellant as his
    daughter within the particulars of that application.  This  would  have
    been at a time when there was no obvious advantage to do so and so  the
    relationship between the appellant and sponsor had long  been  asserted
    to be that of daughter and father.  That is a matter which Judge  Jones
    does not appear to have taken into account.

18. At the hearing, the sponsor produced an amended birth  certificate  for
    the appellant including his name as a result of a statutory declaration
    made on 13 May 2015.  We do not place weight upon this for two reasons.
     First, it was not before Judge Jones in order for her to have taken it
    into account.  Secondly, in any  event,  the  amendment  to  the  birth
    certificate is simply on the declaration of the sponsor  asserting  his
    parenthood.  It provides no independent evidence of their relationship.



19. Nevertheless, Mr Richards, who  represented  the  Secretary  of  State,
    indicated that he was content that the  paternity  finding  should  not
    stand given the long-time assertion by the sponsor that  the  appellant
    is his daughter.

20. For those reasons, Judge  Jones  erred  in  law  in  finding  that  the
    appellant had not established she is the daughter of the  sponsor.   We
    set  aside  that  finding.   In  our  judgment,  the  relationship   is
    established by the evidence on a balance of probabilities.

21. Consequently, we must determine the appellant's  Art  8  claim  in  the
    light of that finding.

22. No additional evidence  was  submitted  by  the  appellant.   The  oral
    evidence of the appellant and sponsor is set out in  the  determination
    of Judge Jones.  We also have a bundle of documents including a witness
    statement by the appellant dated 7 October 2014 and by the  appellant's
    father dated 8 October  2014  together  with  a  short  medical  report
    relating to the appellant's mother.

23. We apply the five-stage approach set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

24. First, as we have already indicated, we accept that the  appellant  and
    sponsor are daughter and father respectively.  The  appellant  came  to
    the United Kingdom when she was 17� years old.  She came to  visit  the
    sponsor who lives with his wife and the  appellant's  step-siblings  in
    the UK.  The evidence before the judge, which she  accepted,  was  that
    the appellant had last seen her father when she was  5  years  old  and
    living with her mother in St Vincent.  That was some eleven  or  twelve
    years ago.  Since then, contact between  them  was  sporadic  and  more
    recently they had been in contact via Skype.  As the judge noted, there
    was no evidence of "any consistent contact" between the  appellant  and
    sponsor until she came to the UK.

25. The appellant's evidence before the judge was (somewhat inconsistently)
    that prior to coming to the UK she had never lived with  a  parent  but
    had always lived with her maternal grandmother in St Vincent.

26. There was no solid evidence  of  any  private  life  developed  by  the
    appellant in the UK since her arrival in August 2013.

27. Even though the appellant is now 18 years of age, we  accept  that  the
    relationship between her and her father amounts to family life for  the
    purposes of Art 8.  We also accept that there will be interference with
    that family life, at least to the  extent  of  daily  contact,  if  the
    appellant returns to St Vincent.

28. We are prepared to accept that Art 8 is engaged to that extent.

29. In relation to Art 8.2, any interference will be in accordance with the
    law and for a legitimate aim  namely  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the
    country.   The  crucial  issue   is   whether   any   interference   is
    proportionate.  That  issue  involves  balancing  the  public  interest
    against the rights and interests of the appellant and  others  affected
    by the decision.

30. As we have already  noted,  the  appellant  cannot  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  In those circumstances, the  public  interest  will
    only be outweighed if there are compelling circumstances such that  the
    consequences of her removal would be unjustifiably harsh (see,  e.g.  R
    (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin); Singh and Singh v  SSHD  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 74 and SSHD v SS(Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ  387).   In
    reaching that assessment, we are  required  to  "have  regard"  to  the
    factors set out in s.117B of the NIA Act 2002.

31. The position is that the appellant lived with her maternal  grandmother
    until she came to the UK in August 2013.  When she came to the UK  that
    was in order to visit the sponsor and not because of any difficulty  or
    problem that existed with her continued residence with her grandmother.
     Her mother had, at that time, already  moved  to  the  British  Virgin
    Islands where she  was  receiving  medical  treatment.   The  sponsor's
    evidence before the judge was that the appellant's grandmother was  now
    too old to look after the appellant.  The sponsor  said  that  he  sent
    money for the appellant's upkeep to her grandmother through  a  friend.
    It is said that the appellant's grandmother has now moved  in  to  live
    with relatives.  The evidence is that she feels  safe  and  emotionally
    connected to her father and his family.

32. The appellant is now an adult and she only left St Vincent in order  to
    make a temporary visit to the UK.  It must have been her intention,  in
    order to qualify for entry, that she intended to return at the  end  of
    her visit.  At that time, her circumstances in  St  Vincent,  in  other
    words, did not encourage her to do otherwise.  She had lived  with  her
    grandmother and financial support was provided by  her  father.   Their
    contact was, as the judge noted,  sporadic.   There  is  no  supporting
    evidence that, if the appellant returned to St Vincent, her grandmother
    would no longer be able to provide accommodation and  a  home  for  the
    appellant as she has previously done.  Nothing in the evidence leads us
    to conclude that the appellant, as an adult, could  not  reasonably  be
    expected to return to St Vincent.  There was some suggestion before  us
    that the appellant was, in effect, a minor in St Vincent but Mr  Mbaeyi
    was unable to support that assertion by any evidence.  In English  law,
    and for the purposes of this appeal, the appellant is to be treated  as
    an adult.

33. Applying s.117B(1) the maintenance of effective immigration controls is
    in the public interest.  As  regards  s.117B(2),  we  accept  that  the
    appellant speaks English and therefore is less likely to be a burden on
    taxpayers and is better able  to  integrate  in  society.   As  regards
    s.117B(3), Mr Mbaeyi did not address us on whether the appellant  would
    be financially independent in the UK.  There was no evidence  that  the
    appellant intended or had any immediate prospect of employment although
    she would, no doubt, continue to receive  financial  support  from  her
    father.  In any event, those factors  provide  the  appellant  with  no
    positive assistance in her claim (see, AM (S 117B) Malawi  [2015]  UKUT
    260 (IAC)).  Further, the appellant's private life in the UK  has  been
    established whilst her immigration status  was  initially  "precarious"
    and latterly "unlawful" and so is  entitled  to  "little  weight"  (see
    s.117B(5) and (4) respectively).

34. The appellant has no right under the Immigration Rules to remain in the
    UK and, as we have already found, we do not consider it unreasonable to
    expect her to return to St Vincent as a young adult  and  continue  the
    life that she relinquished (intending to do so only  temporarily)  when
    coming to the UK as a visitor in August 2013.  Nothing in the  evidence
    persuades us that there are "compelling" circumstances  such  that  the
    consequences to the appellant of  returning  to  St  Vincent  would  be
    unjustifiably harsh.

35. For these  reasons,  we  are  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  has
    established a breach of Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

36. For the above reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  to  dismiss
    the appellant's appeal under Art 8 involved the making of an  error  of
    law.  That decision is set aside.

37. We remake the decision dismissing the appeal under Art 8.

38. For the avoidance of doubt, the appellant's appeal  is  also  dismissed
    under the Immigration Rules.
