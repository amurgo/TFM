Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr T Gaisford, Counsel instructed by Charles Simmons
                    Immigration Solicitors
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal  allowing  the  appeal  of  the  respondent,
    hereinafter "the claimant", against a decision of the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer on 5 June 2013 refusing her entry clearance as a partner  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 2. There were two points taken against the claimant.  It was thought  that
    she did not satisfy the English language requirements  but  that  point
    has since been resolved in her favour.  More  significantly  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was not satisfied that  the  claimant  satisfied  the
    maintenance requirements of the Rules.  In simple terms the sponsor had
    not shown the Entry Clearance Officer that he earned sufficient  money.
    The Entry Clearance Officer said:

         "Your sponsor is not exempt  from  the  financial  requirements  as
         defined at paragraph E-ECP.3.3.  I am not able to take into account
         any potential employment you have available to you in the UK or any
         offers of financial support from third parties.  In order  to  meet
         the financial requirements of the Rules your sponsor needs a  gross
         income of at least �18,600 per annum (or if applying with one child
         �22,400 and an additional �2,400 for each additional child).

         For tax year 20/11/12 you declared  income  of  �9,252  before  tax
         deductions.  The latest annual self-assessment tax return  to  HMRC
         does not show the necessary level of gross income.  For this reason
         I refuse your application under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d)  of  Appendix
         FM of the Immigration Rules.  (E-ECP.3.1)

         You have elected to  have  your  financial  requirement  considered
         under income  from  self-employment  but  you  have  not  specified
         whether you wish for your  circumstances  to  be  considered  under
         category F or G.  You have not provided the following documents  as
         evidence of your sponsor's gross income:

         -     Where  the  person  holds  or  held  separate  business  bank
             account(s), bank statements for the same twelve  month  period
             as the tax return(s).

         -    Personal bank statements for the same twelve month  period  as
             the tax return(s) showing that the income from self-employment
             has been paid into an account in the name of the person or  in
             the name of the person and their partner jointly.

         You  have  failed  to  provide  the  specified  documents  of  your
         sponsor's  employment,  as  listed  above.   These  documents   are
         specified in Immigration  Rules  in  Appendix  FM-SE  and  must  be
         provided.  I therefore refuse your application under paragraph  EC-
         P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  (E- ECP.3.1)"

 3. As far as I can see no one has criticised the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    for the findings he made or the decision he  reached  on  the  evidence
    that was presented to him.  However the sponsor was able to improve his
    financial circumstances and significantly increase his income from  his
    work as a minicab driver.  This was explained to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager in an appeal review.  In the response dated  4  June  2014  the
    Entry Clearance Manager said:

         "The [claimant] has now provided documents that postdate  the  date
         of application and pertain to the 2012/2013  tax  year  and  states
         that these show  that  the  Rules  have  been  met.   However,  the
         [claimant]  has  shifted  the  operative  date  from  the  date  of
         application to the date of decision or to  some  other  date.   The
         Immigration Rules have not been  met,  because  the  Rules  include
         requirements, including as to time periods, to be met at  the  date
         of application.  For specified  documents,  the  Immigration  Rules
         specifically states the time periods that any evidence must  cover,
         and specifically states throughout the Immigration Rules  that  all
         such documents are assessed pertaining to the date of  application.
         If the Rules have been  subsequently  met  then  the  Appellant  is
         required to reapply.  The documents provided  in  relation  to  the
         financial year 2012/2013 should therefore form the basis of  a  new
         application."

 4. That explanation, if I may say so, is commendable for its clarity.  The
    First-tier Tribunal decided that it was clearly wrong.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge explained his decision in  the  following
    way:

         "21. I find that by the date of the ECM review on 4 June 2014,  the
         ECM had before him additional documents relating  to  the  date  of
         decision under appeal.  I find that  these  comprised  of  all  the
         specified documents in relation to  the  sponsor's  self-employment
         for the preceding tax year  2012-2013  including  evidence  of  tax
         payable, his  self-assessment  return,  his  unique  tax  reference
         number, evidence that  he  is  registered  as  self-employed,  bank
         statements for the twelve month period from April 2012 until  April
         2013 and evidence of national insurance contributions.

         22.  Having had regard to the entry clearance instructions, I  find
         that the Entry Clearance  Manager  has  the  power  to  review  the
         decision and concede it  where  additional  evidence  is  submitted
         which appertains to the date of the  decision  under  appeal.   The
         guidance states that the ECM must look at the circumstances leading
         up to the date of refusal  and  where  the  appellant  successfully
         addresses  all  the  points  of  refusal  the  decision  should  be
         overturned.  I find that the ECM in this  appeal  has  applied  the
         incorrect test when he refers to the relevant date being  the  date
         of application."

 6. The First-tier Tribunal then allowed the appeal.  The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was given permission to challenge this decision.  Point  10  of
    the grounds is particularly apposite.  It says:

         "For the purpose of the appeal the  [claimant]  provided  documents
         which postdate the application and pertain  to  the  2012-2013  tax
         year.  These documents do not assist the [claimant] in meeting  the
         requirements of the Immigration Rules as the Rules  stipulate  time
         periods that the evidence must cover."

 7. With respect to Mr Nath he was not able to answer the  obvious  enquiry
    about which Rules the Entry Clearance Officer had in mind and  where  I
    could find them.  I can find no such requirement in the Rules and I  am
    confident that Mr Gaisford would have looked and would have drawn  them
    to my attention if he had known that they were there.

 8. It is instructive to remember that by reason of Section  85(4)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 the  default  position  is
    that when a Tribunal is considering an appeal it:

         "may consider evidence about any matter which it thinks relevant to
         the substance of the decision, including evidence which concerns  a
         matter arising after the date of the decision."

 9. However this default position is subject to  two  important  exceptions
    which are set out in paragraph 85A of the  2002  Act.   Section  85A(2)
    provides:

         "Exception 1 is that in reference to an appeal under Section  82(1)
         against an immigration decision of  a  kind  specified  in  Section
         82(2)(b) or (c) the Tribunal may consider  only  the  circumstances
         appertaining at the date of decision."

10.  The  specified  appeals  are  appeals  against  immigration  decisions
    refusing entry clearance (such as the instant decision) or  refusing  a
    Certificate of  Entitlement.   Mr  Gaisford  argued  that  exception  1
    clearly applies here and the  First-tier  Tribunal  rightly  considered
    evidence appertaining at the time of decision.

11. Exception 2 provides that the Tribunal may consider evidence adduced by
    the appellant only if it was  submitted  at  the  time  of  making  the
    application.  However exception 2 does not apply to all  cases  but  to
    appeals against refusal of leave to enter the United Kingdom, refuse to
    vary a person's leave to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  or
    applications made under the points-based system.

12. In short no-one has been able to refer me to anything that supports the
    Entry Clearance Officer's understanding of the law and statute  appears
    to be completely against the Entry Clearance Officer's understanding.

13. I can see no error on the part of the First-tier Tribunal and I  uphold
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and dismiss the Entry Clearance
    Officer's appeal.

14. Although this was not specifically argued before me I am aware  of  the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  Paragraph D provides  that  where  the
    Appendix states that specified documents must  be  provided  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer or Secretary of State will  only  consider  documents
    submitted after the application where certain conditions identified  in
    sub-paragraph (b) or (e) apply.   I  have  not  decided  if  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was prohibited by this Rule from looking  at  further
    documents.  It is  quite  clear  that  the  Tribunal  had  a  statutory
    obligation to consider them and did.

15. It follows therefore that  I  dismiss  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    appeal.
