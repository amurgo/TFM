                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. This is the claimant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal, from a  decision  of
   the First-tier Tribunal (the tribunal) which it sent to the parties on 28
   May 2019 following a hearing of 30 April 2019. The tribunal dismissed the
   claimant's appeal against a decision of the Secretary  of  State,  of  13
   March 2019, refusing to grant her international protection.

2. The tribunal did not direct  anonymity.  However,  although  nothing  was
   said about that one way or the other before me, I have decided to do  so.
   That is because the claimant's account, if  it  turns  out  to  be  true,
   contains some sensitive material regarding allegations of sexual  assault
   and rape.

3. This case came before me so that,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
   Tribunal having been granted, it could be decided  whether  the  tribunal
   had  erred  in  law  and,  if  it  had,  what  should  flow  from   that.
   Representation  was  as  stated  above  and  I  am   grateful   to   each
   representative. The hearing was, in fact, a very short one indeed because
   there was agreement between the parties that the  tribunal  had,  indeed,
   erred in law. As to that, Mr McVeety accepted that the tribunal had  made
   an error of fact in erroneously thinking that the claimant  had  asserted
   that a person I will simply refer to as Y, was her brother as opposed  to
   being a more distant relative. As a result of that mistake  the  tribunal
   drew an adverse inference from the fact that Y had not been  named  on  a
   civil registry document. Y would have been named on that document had  he
   been the claimant's brother. It is clear from what the  tribunal  had  to
   say at paragraph 10 of its written reasons that, in  consequence  of  the
   above, it regarded the civil registry document as  being  unreliable  and
   that that meant, followed its reasoning, it could not be  satisfied  that
   the claimant's father was deceased as the document purported to show  and
   as she had claimed. It considered that to be 'significantly  damaging  to
   the appellant's credibility'. It also thought, in  effect,  that  if  the
   claimant's father was not deceased that significantly undermined much  of
   her claim.

4. So, as is agreed between the parties, the tribunal's mistake of fact  led
   it to make an adverse finding with respect to the credibility of part  of
   the claimant's account in circumstances where it might otherwise, but for
   the error, not have done so. In those circumstances that  does  translate
   into an error  of  law.  Accordingly,  I  have  decided,  effectively  by
   consent, to set aside the tribunal's decision.

5. The claimant had raised a number of other grounds of appeal to the  Upper
   Tribunal when seeking permission. However, it is not now necessary for me
   to deal with them. Any other errors that the  tribunal  might  have  made
   will be subsumed by the fresh hearing which will now follow.  There  will
   be a fresh hearing because I have decided, as both parties urged  me  to,
   to remit for a complete re-hearing of the appeal.

6. My having decided to remit I am statutorily obliged to  issue  directions
   for the remaking of the decision. However, I need not be overly  detailed
   or prescriptive about that. I simply direct that there will be a complete
   re-hearing of the appeal which will take place before a  different  Judge
   to the one who had previously decided the appeal.  Any  other  directions
   may be left to the tribunal to decide for itself.

7. This appeal to the Upper Tribunal then is allowed on  the  basis  and  to
   the extent explained above.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and is set aside. The case is remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  so
that the decision may be remade.

The  claimant  is  granted  anonymity.  Accordingly,  no  report  of   these
proceedings shall name or otherwise  identify  her  or  any  member  of  her
family. That applies to all parties to the proceedings.  Failure  to  comply
may lead to contempt of court proceedings.
