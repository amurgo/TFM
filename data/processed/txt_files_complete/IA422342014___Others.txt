Representation:
For the claimants:     Ms A Seehra, instructed by Farani Javid Taylor
Solicitors
For the appellant:     Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, with dates of birth as recorded in the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, are all citizens of Pakistan.  They  form  husband
    and wife, and their two children.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Howard  promulgated  17.6.15,  allowing  on
    immigration grounds and human rights grounds the linked appeals of  the
    claimants against  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  dated
    5.10.14, to refuse their applications for leave to remain in the UK and
    to remove them from the UK pursuant to section 10  of  the  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 1999.  The Judge heard the appeal on 1.4.15.

 3. Designated First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Zucker  granted  permission  to
    appeal on 2.9.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 7.12.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below I found such error of law in  the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Howard to be set aside and remade.

 6. The relevant background can be briefly summarised as follows. The first
    claimant arrived in the UK in 2006 with leave as a  student.  His  wife
    the second claimant joined him as his dependant in 2007 and  their  two
    children, the third and fourth claimants, were born in the UK  in  2003
    and 2012. The first child has now been in the UK for over 7  years  and
    the appeal largely revolved around his needs as autistic. Whilst  being
    educated in mainstream schooling, his  education  is  tailored  to  his
    specific needs.

 7. The adult claimants had no leave beyond 2010. In July  2012  the  first
    three claimants made application for leave to remain in the  UK.  Prior
    to the decision of the Secretary of State the fourth claimant was  born
    and made a joint application.  It  is  against  the  refusal  of  these
    applications with which the present appeal is concerned.

 8. As Judge Howard found at �12 of the decision,  none  of  the  claimants
    could meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules.  The  judge  specifically
    rejected the contention that the third claimant met  paragraph  276ADE,
    because it requires the 7-year criterion to  be  met  at  the  date  of
    application, which it was not. At �13  the  judge  specifically  stated
    that the claimants  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  any  of  the
    Immigration Rules. In the circumstances, the decision is  in  error  in
    allowing the appeal on immigration grounds, as Ms Seehra conceded,  and
    for that reason alone must be set aside.

 9. The grounds also submit that the judge erred in venturing into a  free-
    standing article 8 consideration, relying on Singh v SSHD  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 74, which in turn endorsed the ration of Nagre.  It  is  now  clear
    that if the consideration under  the  Rules  has  fully  addressed  any
    family life or private life issue arising under article 8, there is  no
    reason to go on to a separate and distinct consideration of article  8.
    In SSHD v SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    held that it is clear that whilst the assessment of  Article  8  claims
    requires  a  two-stage  analysis,  and  there  is   no   threshold   or
    intermediary requirement of arguability before a decision  maker  moves
    to consider the second stage, whether that  second  stage  is  required
    will depend on whether all the issues have  been  adequately  addressed
    under the Rules. In other words, there is no need  to  conduct  a  full
    separate examination of article  8  outside  the  Rules  where  in  the
    circumstances of a particular case, all issues have been  addressed  in
    the consideration  under  the  Rules.  The  same  case  upheld  the  MF
    (Nigeria) formulation of the need to identify compelling  circumstances
    in order to justify a grant of LTR outside the Rules.  In  the  present
    case, at �14 not only did Judge Howard apply the wrong test  for  going
    on to consider article 8 outside the Rules, but failed to identify what
    compelling  circumstances  were  insufficiently  provided  for  in  the
    Immigration Rules and why those circumstances would render the decision
    of the Entry Clearance Officer unjustifiably harsh. Instead, the  judge
    referred to "an arguable case  that  there  may  be  good  grounds  for
    granting leave to remain outside the Rules." There was no reference  to
    compelling circumstances.

10. It may be that had the judge applied the correct test,  he  would  have
    found the circumstances of the third claimant  sufficiently  compelling
    to at least justify an  article  8  consideration  outside  the  Rules.
    However, it is not possible to make such a conclusion in the absence of
    identified compelling circumstances to justify consideration of article
    8 at all. In the circumstances for this reason also the decision is  in
    error and cannot stand.

11. I also note an error in the judge's treatment of section  117B  of  the
    2002 Act, which sets out public interest considerations which must form
    part of any article 8 ECHR proportionality assessment.  At  �16(4)  the
    judge appears to give credit in the proportionality balancing  exercise
    to the fact that the first claimant speaks excellent English  and  that
    the family is not in receipt of any  benefits.  As  AM  (s117B)  Malawi
    [2015] UKUT 0260  (IAC)  makes  clear,  "An  appellant  can  obtain  no
    positive right to a grant of leave to remain from  either  s117B(2)  or
    (3), whatever the degree of his fluency in English, or the strength  of
    his financial resources."

12. The judge makes no reference to  the  fact,  other  that  reciting  the
    statute, that immigration control is in the public interest  and  there
    is no, or insufficient, attention paid to  the  direction  that  little
    weight should be given to a private life established by a person  at  a
    time when the person's immigration status is  precarious.  As  has  now
    been made clear in Dube (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC),  judges
    are duty bound  to  "have  regard"  to  the  specified  considerations.
    Further, the status of a person whose lawful presence in the UK depends
    on the granting of further leave to remain is entirely  precarious.  On
    the facts of this case, the claimants were all in the UK unlawfully and
    thus both 117B(4) and (5) apply.

13. The judge did consider 117B(6), under which the third claimant would be
    a qualifying child, having been in  the  UK  for  more  than  7  years.
    However, the assessment as to whether it would be reasonable to  expect
    him to leave the UK takes no account of  the  fact  that  none  of  the
    claimants are British and have any right  to  education  or  any  other
    special treatment in the UK. The test under 117B(6) appears  to  be  no
    different to that under 276ADE.

14. The third principal ground submits that the judge erred in allowing the
    appeal on human rights grounds principally on the basis  of  the  third
    claimant's autism. In  granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Zucker
    stated, "It is arguable that the high threshold  which  would  need  to
    have been met was not established and that the judge therefore erred in
    his proportionality assessment. The Upper Tribunal may be  assisted  by
    consideration of the guidance in Akhalu (health claim: ECHR Article  8)
    [2013] UKUT 400 (IAC)."

15. Undoubtedly, this family should have left the  UK  in  2010,  when  the
    student leave expired. It is clear that even though they do  not  claim
    state benefits, they have used NHS and educational services,  to  which
    they are not entitled, at considerable public expense. They are already
    a significant burden on the state. None of these factors appear to have
    been adequately brought into the  proportionality  balancing  exercise.
    The judge concentrates only  on  whether  the  third  claimant  can  be
    "educated appropriately in Pakistan," and his  finding  that  that  the
    parents cannot afford to pay for specialised education. At  �16(5)  the
    judge  was  not  satisfied   that   sponsorship,   suggested   by   the
    representative of the Secretary of State, was available for  the  third
    claimant. The judge went on to identify the issue as being whether  the
    third claimant "were able to go to and function at a school that has no
    provision  for  his  needs  there  would  be  no  argument   but   that
    collectively this family should be  removed.  However,  he  cannot  and
    provision for him is not  available  in  Pakistan."  It  is  not  clear
    whether in referring  to  'provision'  the  judge  is  referencing  the
    inability of the parents to meet the cost of  specialist  education  at
    the Oasis Trust, or whether, as Ms  Seehra  contended,  the  judge  was
    referring to the claimants' evidence that the school would  not  accept
    the child because they only accept non-verbal pupils, and the third  in
    fact claimant speaks English.

16. In any event, the judge has not taken account of the principles set out
    in Akhalu (health claim: ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT  00400  (IAC),  to
    which this case is akin, even though it may be arguable as  to  whether
    education of an autistic child is a health issue.  There  it  was  held
    that in conducting the proportionality  assessment  the  countervailing
    public interest in removal  will  outweigh  the  consequences  for  the
    health of the claimant because of a disparity of health care facilities
    in all but a very few rare cases. "The consequences of removal for  the
    health of a claimant who would not be able to access equivalent  health
    care in their country of nationality as was available in  this  country
    are plainly relevant to the  question  of  proportionality.  But,  when
    weighed against the  public  interest  in  ensuring  that  the  limited
    resources of this country's health services are used to the best effect
    for the benefit of those for whom they are intended, those consequences
    do not weigh heavily in the claimant's favour  but  speak  cogently  in
    support of the public interest in removal." I take into account in this
    regard that the situation of a child, where the Tribunal is statutorily
    required to take  account  of  the  best  interests,  may  be  somewhat
    different than for an adult. However, without reaching  any  conclusion
    on the matter, I find that this issue was not adequately  addressed  in
    the First-tier Tribunal decision.

17. In conclusion, I am satisfied that the judge has failed  to  adequately
    address the best interests of the child against the  competing  factors
    in favour of the public interest in removal of this family to Pakistan.
    The proportionality assessment is rather one-sided and incomplete, such
    that it amounts to an error of law and cannot stand.

18. In setting aside the decision, I have considered Ms Seehra's submission
    that I  should  preserve  the  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    However, those findings are so inextricably tied up with the inadequate
    article 8 assessment that I am  satisfied  they  are  also  drawn  into
    question. Further, it would be impracticable to  tie  a  judge's  hands
    especially when, as an in-country case, the circumstances  have  to  be
    considered as at the date of any future hearing. I thus do not preserve
    any such findings.

19. Ms Seehra explained that the  claimants  were  not  in  a  position  to
    proceed with a hearing to remake the decision in the linked appeals and
    further submitted that this case should be remitted to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. I accede to that request.

20. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates  all  findings  of
    fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been  a
    valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

21. In all the circumstances, I relist this appeal for a fresh  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal, I do so on the basis that this is a case which
    falls squarely within the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement  at
    paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of  the  error  has  been  to  deprive  the
    appellant of a fair hearing and  that  the  nature  or  extent  of  any
    judicial fact finding which is necessary for the decision in the appeal
    to be re-made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
    in rule 2 to deal with cases fairly  and  justly,  including  with  the
    avoidance of delay, I find that it is appropriate to remit this  appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal to determine the appeal afresh.





Conclusions:

22. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the decision in the linked appeals to the First-
                    tier Tribunal to be made afresh.

Consequential Directions

23. The linked appeals are to be relisted before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    sitting at Hatton Cross;

24. The time estimate is 2 hours;

25. No findings of fact are preserved and the  linked  appeals  are  to  be
    heard afresh;

26. The claimants should serve and lodge with the First-tier  Tribunal  not
    later than 14 days before the listed hearing a  single  new,  paginated
    and indexed, bundle of all subject and objective materials to be relied
    on,  together  with  copies  of  all  case  authorities  or   statutory
    provisions, or policies, etc. The Tribunal must not be asked  to  trawl
    through previous bundles in order to locate the relevant evidence.  The
    Tribunal is unlikely to accept such evidence and information  submitted
    on the day of hearing.

27. The Tribunal may issue further directions as appropriate.



Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. The  First-tier  Tribunal  made  an  order.  Given  the
circumstances of children being involved, I continue that anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the linked appeals remain to be decided.
