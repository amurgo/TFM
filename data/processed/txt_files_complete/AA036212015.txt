Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr. K Gayle, Elder Rahimi Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Iran, born on 12 April 1998. He  appeals
    with permission against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Broe,
    promulgated on  18  June  2015,  dismissing  his  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights appeals.

 2. In granting permission to appeal, Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy  stated
    that while it may be that the grounds of appeal are really no more than
    a disagreement with findings of fact which the Judge  was  entitled  to
    make on the evidence before her, given that it  is  accepted  that  the
    appellant's father had been detained and also that he is so much  older
    than his siblings and so could have been singled out for expulsion from
    school, and further taking into  account  the  terms  of  his  mother's
    email, the grounds are arguable.

    The background

 3. The appellant is a national of  Iran  who  arrived  in  the  UK  on  14
    November 2013 when he was 15 years old, claiming asylum on arrival.  He
    attended a screening interview that day,  followed  by  a  full  asylum
    interview on 30 January 2015.

 4. In the statement accompanying his claim the appellant asserted that  he
    is a national of Iran, born  on  12  April  1998.  He  lived  with  his
    parents, his brother and his sister until the family home was raided by
    the Etalla'at in April or May 2013. They took his father away  and  the
    family claims not to have seen him since. He claimed  that  his  father
    was detained in Evin Prison. After that the house was raided every  few
    days  and  their  neighbours  were  questioned  about  any   suspicious
    activity. He was expelled from school in June 2013 and was told that he
    could not sit his exams because his father was an anti- regime activist
    [10].

 5. His passport was seized during one of the raids. They said he  was  too
    young to be detained with his father but made it clear that he would be
    detained when he turned 18. He argued  with  them  during  one  of  the
    raids. They wanted to take him away but his mother persuaded  them  not
    to do so. He said it was  only  a  matter  of  time  before  they  lost
    patience and took him away. His  mother  then  spoke  to  his  brother,
    Davoud, who found an agent to take him to a safe place.  The  appellant
    left Iran on 25 October 2013 [11].

 6. Whilst in the UK he has been in contact with his mother who provided  a
    letter stating that his father was still in prison. No reason had  been
    given for the detention. His mother is certain that it would be  unsafe
    for the appellant to return. He is not aware of  his  father's  alleged
    activities.  He claimed  that  he  is  of  "ongoing  interest"  to  the
    authorities. He  would  be  suspected  of  being  anti-regime  and  the
    situation has not improved with the election of the new President [12].

    The respondent's case

 7. Whilst the respondent accepted that his father  had  been  arrested  in
    March or April 2013 in connection with  an  allegation  of  anti-regime
    activities, she did not accept that the  Ettela'at  would  continue  to
    raid  the  house  when  they  found  nothing  implicating  his  father.
    Moreover, the appellant  had  not  been  involved  in  any  anti-regime
    activity and had no knowledge of what was alleged against  his  father.
    Accordingly, the respondent did not accept that the  authorities  would
    have any interest in him.

 8. The respondent stated in reliance on the  background  information  that
    the appellant, even if under the age of 18, would be above the  age  of
    criminal  responsibility.  It  was  therefore  not  credible  that  the
    authorities would wait until he attained that age before taking  action
    against him. He could  have  been  prosecuted  through  the  children's
    court.

 9. Nor did the respondent find it credible that the appellant  would  have
    been singled out from his siblings because they were all children of an
    anti-regime activist. He also failed to show why the authorities  would
    have any interest in him but not his mother. Accordingly,  it  was  not
    accepted that the authorities would have an interest in  the  appellant
    on his return to Iran. It was in his best interests that he  return  to
    rejoin his family.

10. Although the Judge stated at paragraph  1  of  the  decision  that  the
    appellant's claim was certified under s.94(2) of the 2002 Act as  being
    clearly unfounded, the basis for that statement is not clear. The  Home
    Office Presenting Officer did not make any submissions in that respect.
    The appellant's appeal  proceeded  without  further  reference  to  the
    alleged certification and no submissions in that respect were  made  by
    either representative before the Upper Tribunal.

    Submissions

11. Mr Gayle relied on the grounds of appeal accompanying  the  application
    for permission. He noted that the Judge accepted that  the  appellant's
    father had been arrested and detained in Iran. That was  the  basis  of
    his claim that be would be at risk himself.

12. The Judge acknowledged that the background  information  confirmed  the
    arbitrary nature of detentions in  Iran.  That  would  also  extend  to
    raids. Mr Gayle submitted  that  the  appellant  provided  a  plausible
    account. The Judge erred in failing to provide  "sufficient  reasoning"
    for rejecting his evidence regarding the repeated raids  on  his  house
    and why the authorities did not arrest and detain him.

13. He referred to the Judge's findings regarding the appellant's claim  to
    have been expelled from school because of his father. She did not  find
    it likely that he would be distinguished from his siblings in this way.
    Mr Gayle submitted that the Judge ignored the  appellant's  explanation
    for the distinction, namely, that his sister was only  nine  years  old
    and his brother six at the time and not yet in school.

14. Further, he submitted that the Judge misrepresented the contents of the
    appellant's mother's email. She merely quoted from  a  section  of  the
    email where his mother stated that he would not be able  to  return  to
    school or get a job in the civil service. The Judge  then  stated  that
    "... her concerns are clear and I am not persuaded  that  his  fear  of
    treatment amounting to persecution is genuine."  She  was  further  not
    persuaded that the risks the mother described, if genuine, amounted  to
    persecution [24].

15. However, Mr Gayle noted that the email went on to state that

         "...... every day I thank god that you left and that you managed to
         get away from everything and everyone. Here everything is all  over
         the place. The situation has become worse than when you were  here.
         We are under severe  pressure.  Lives  have  become  merely  giving
         answers to questions from this person and that  person.  There  has
         still not been any news about your father..... be careful so  that,
         god forbid, you do not come back otherwise the rest  of  your  life
         will be  destroyed  here.  Remember  the  days  when  everyone  was
         harassing you? If you return you won't be permitted to go  back  to
         school; you won't be able to take a job in the civil  service;  you
         won't be able to do anything here. So please don't even think about
         returning."

16. He referred to [24] of the decision where the  Judge  stated  that  the
    appellant's mother made no mention of the risk  of  imprisonment  which
    had been claimed by the appellant since  his  screening  interview.  He
    submitted  in  that  respect,  that  his  mother's  statement  was  not
    professionally drafted. It is 'implicit' that anyone reading the  email
    would be aware of the background to the  appellant's  claim,  including
    his risk from the Iranian authorities. Moreover, the  Judge  failed  to
    provide any alternative reasons for the reference to  school  expulsion
    or banning from the civil service job if the appellant were returned to
    Iran.

17. Mr Gayle referred to  [25]  where  the  Judge  considered  whether  the
    situation had changed since the appellant has been in the UK. There was
    no dispute that the respondent contacted his mother on the date of  the
    interview. The appellant claimed that the call was monitored  and  that
    his mother had been questioned, although not detained. The  summary  of
    the call revealed that his mother confirmed their relationship and that
    he was living with her before he left Iran. Ms Isherwood intervened  to
    contend that the Judge noted at [25] that there was  nothing  from  his
    mother to confirm that she was subsequently questioned.

18. Mr Gayle referred to the appellant's claim that this call increased the
    risks he faced if returned, as the call was monitored  by  the  Iranian
    authorities. He submitted that the Judge's analysis and finding at [26]
    that the  telephone  call  would  not  have  placed  the  appellant  at
    increased risk of return as they were already aware that the  appellant
    was in the UK, is flawed.

19. At [26] the Judge referred to the appellant's claim that  his  mother's
    emails would not be monitored as she used Internet caf�s and not  their
    home connection. She considered the ' objective evidence' on this issue
    and noted that in the USSD Report for 2013 there is a reference to a UN
    report which stated that the Minister of Information and  Communication
    Technology Regulations prohibits households and cybercaf�s from  having
    high speed  internet  access,  and  in  January  2012,  the  government
    required cybercaf�s to install  security  cameras  and  collect  users'
    personal information. According to domestic press reports,  the  police
    inspected 352 internet caf�s during one week in July and closed 67  for
    offering "illegal services" to youth.

20.  The  Judge  accordingly  found  that  the  report   contradicted   the
    appellant's  account  of  communications  with  his  mother.   If   the
    authorities were interested in his whereabouts, they would already know
    that he was in  the  UK.  She  accordingly  did  not  accept  that  the
    telephone call would place him at risk as he claimed [26].

21.  Mr  Gayle  submitted  that  the  report  did  not  state  that  it  is
    'inevitable'  that  all  emails  would  be   intercepted   by   Iranian
    authorities and that the analysis is accordingly flawed.

22. He further submitted that it is evident from  [27]  to  [29]  that  the
    Judge accepted that the appellant's father had been detained for  anti-
    regime activities and that the family home had been raided, and that he
    may have been  expelled  from  school[1].  The  Judge  found  that  his
    presence in the UK has not worsened his situation in Iran and  that  he
    would be returned there as a failed asylum seeker  who  left  illegally
    [27].

23. It was against that background that the Judge stated at [28]  that  she
    gave careful consideration to any risk that he may face  on  return  to
    Iran. She had regard to SB (Risk on return  -  Illegal  Exit)  Iran  CG
    [2009] UKAIT 00053, where she summarised the Tribunal's  findings  that
    Iranians facing forced return do not in general face  a  real  risk  of
    persecution or ill treatment. That remains the case even if they exited
    Iran illegally. Having exited Iran illegally is not a significant  risk
    factor,  although  if  it  is  the  case  that  a  person  would   face
    difficulties with the authorities for other  reasons,  such  a  history
    could be a factor adding to the difficulties he is likely to face.

24. In the circumstances, the Judge concluded that the appellant would  not
    face a real risk of persecution [29].

25. Mr Gayle submitted that in line with the reasoning in SB, supra, it  is
    inevitable that the  appellant  would  be  interrogated.  His  father's
    profile would be  known  by  the  interrogators.  That  would  increase
    suspicion of the appellant, which would be exacerbated  by  his  having
    returned from the UK, a pariah state as far as the Iranian  authorities
    are concerned.

26. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Isherwood submitted that there had been
    no material errors. The grounds of appeal amount to a disagreement with
    the findings of fact which the  Judge  was  entitled  to  make  on  the
    evidence before her.

27. With regard to the finding at  [24]  that  it  was  unlikely  that  the
    appellant would be distinguished  from  his  siblings  because  of  his
    father, Ms Isherwood referred  to  paragraph  35  of  the  reasons  for
    refusal regarding the appellant's  claim  that  he  was  expelled  from
    school. By his own admission, his younger brother and sister  were  not
    expelled, despite the fact that they were children of a  claimed  anti-
    regime activist.

28. She referred to questions 100-102 of the appellant's interview where he
    stated that a few months after his father's arrest,  his  teacher  told
    him that he received a call from Ettela'at telling the  school  not  to
    allow him to take part in the  examinations  because  of  his  father's
    activities. From that point he was not able to go back to school.  When
    asked whether any of his siblings were similarly expelled from  school,
    he said that his brother is only six years  old.  He  does  not  go  to
    school and his sister is young and goes to primary school.  Nobody  has
    prevented her attending primary school.

29. Ms Isherwood submitted that the appellant's claim  that  the  Ettela'at
    stated that he was too young to  be  detained  but  that  he  would  be
    detained when he became 18 was  properly  found  by  the  Judge  to  be
    inconsistent with the available background information as  set  out  at
    paragraph 34 of the  reasons  for  refusal.  In  accordance  with  that
    information, the appellant would have been above the  age  of  criminal
    responsibility and if the authorities were seeking to arrest  him  they
    would have done  so  and  placed  him  in  a  juvenile  correction  and
    rehabilitation centre prior to going to court.

30. Nor she submitted is the Iranian state  averse  to  executing  children
    under the age of 18, undermining his claim  that  the  officers  stated
    that they would return when he was 18 to arrest him.  She  referred  to
    the Iran COIS report dated September 2013, paragraph 24.20.  She  noted
    that the Judge at [14] had regard to the background information,  which
    would include the information  referred  to  at  paragraph  34  of  the
    reasons for refusal.

31. The finding at [23] that there was a legal  avenue  to  deal  with  the
    appellant, was evident from the report itself. The judge properly noted
    that the authorities thus had the opportunity  to  take  lawful  action
    including detention regardless of his age, but they chose not to do so.
     The fact that they did not indicated that he was  not  of  significant
    interest to them [23].

32. Ms Isherwood submitted with regard  to  the  mother's  email,  that  it
    largely related to the appellant's education in the  UK.  The  emphasis
    throughout was on the appellant going to school in the UK. It  did  not
    even allege that the authorities are looking for him. It stated that if
    he returned he would not be permitted to go back to school  or  take  a
    job in the civil service. He would not be able to do anything in  Iran.
    She submitted that before the  appellant's  father's  imprisonment,  he
    worked in the supply of lorry parts and  had  not  been  in  the  civil
    service.

33. With regard to the contention that the  Judge  had  misrepresented  the
    content of the email, she submitted  that  the  further  comments  were
    added by his mother in order to bolster his claim.

34. As to the contention that it is inevitable that the appellant would  be
    interrogated on return to Iran, Ms Isherwood referred to the summary by
    the Tribunal in SB regarding the risks of return.   She contended  with
    regard to the relevant factors identified, that  no  court  proceedings
    relating to the appellant had been taken out in Iran;  no  summons  has
    been issued against him; the appellant had not insulted  the  judiciary
    and the appellant had not been accused of  anti-Islamic  conduct  which
    would amount to a significant  risk  factor  [45]  nor  are  there  any
    ongoing proceedings [46].

35. Ms Isherwood accepted that the appellant  had  exited  Iran  illegally.
    Having exited illegally was not a significant risk factor  although  if
    it is  the  case  that  a  person  would  face  difficulties  with  the
    authorities for other reasons, such a history could be a factor  adding
    to the level of difficulties he or she is likely to face.

36. She noted that the Tribunal in SB observed that there was some  tension
    in the recent background evidence as to the  precise  position  of  the
    consequences of illegal exit. On the one hand, it might cause a  person
    to face a relatively modest fine with nothing more untoward than  that.
    On the other, the discovery of illegal exit could result in the  person
    being arrested and taken to a special court at the airport.

37. Moreover, a person who left Iran facing court  proceedings  other  than
    ordinary civil proceedings could be a risk factor. She  submitted  that
    that does not apply to the appellant.

38. Being accused of anti  Islamic  conduct  could  likewise  constitute  a
    significant risk factor. He had not been accused of  such  conduct  and
    the remaining risk factor did not apply to him.

39. Ms Isherwood  also  noted  that  the  appellant  had  stated  in  cross
    examination that he had never been involved in political activities  in
    Iran. Nor had Ettela'at found anything incriminating in  the  raids  on
    his house. His mother was questioned but was  not  detained  after  the
    telephone call. He was in contact with her about twice a week by  Skype
    because the telephones were tapped.

40. She submitted that the Judge properly found at [26] that the UN Special
    Rapporteur's   report   contradicted   the   appellant's   account   of
    communications with his mother.

41. In response, Mr Gayle submitted that the implication  in  the  mother's
    email might be that raids at their home have continued.

42. Further, the fact that his mother is interested  in  his  education  is
    completely understandable. She is also understandably worried  that  he
    would not be able to obtain a job in the civil service if returned.

43. Mr Gayle confirmed that there had been no attempt to obtain any witness
    statement from the mother setting out what happened to the family since
    the appellant left Iran.

44. He submitted with regard to SB that an additional risk factor would  be
    that the appellant had made a claim for asylum in the  UK  and  coupled
    with his father's past activities, this might be seen  as  anti-Islamic
    conduct.

45. He submitted that the call  from  the  respondent  to  the  appellant's
    mother would increase the risk for the appellant. With  regard  to  the
    USSD report, he again submitted that it does not say that all mails are
    intercepted. It would therefore not be inevitable that the  authorities
    would in any event have known his whereabouts.

    Assessment

46. The Judge at [27] has summarised her findings regarding the  appellant.
    He is an Iranian whose father was detained for anti-regime  activities.
    She accepted that the family home was visited by security forces.   She
    noted that there was the opportunity by the security forced  to  detain
    the appellant but they chose not to do so. It is also accepted that the
    appellant may have been expelled from school. He will  be  returned  to
    Iran as a failed asylum seeker who left illegally.

47. The evidence before the Tribunal was that the father  was  detained  in
    April or May 2013. However, the appellant only left Iran some  five  or
    six months later [22]. He had claimed that the house was  raided  every
    few days after his father was arrested. This the Judge found not to  be
    credible, bearing in mind that on the appellant's account,  nothing  of
    significance was found. She also rejected his evidence in this  context
    that the authorities came to the house  and  threatened  to  take  him,
    which was avoided after his mother intervened.

48. In making these  findings  the  Judge  had  regard  to  the  background
    evidence  including  the  legal  system  in  Iran  allowing   for   the
    prosecution of those under 18 years of age. The background  information
    also described unlawful and arbitrary detentions. She accordingly found
    on the basis of that background evidence  that  there  was  nothing  to
    prevent the security forces from taking either a legal avenue  to  deal
    with the appellant or "a propensity" to take unlawful action.

49. She dismissed the contention that,  having  had  every  opportunity  to
    detain the appellant, regardless of his age, they chose not to  do  so;
    she went on to reject the appellant's evidence that they did  not  take
    action against him because he was under 18. She found that he  was  not
    detained at he time as he was not  of  significant  interest  to  them.
    Those findings are sustainable and were open to her.

50. It is correct, as submitted, that the Judge's assessment  that  it  was
    unlikely that he would  be  expelled  from  the  school,  and  not  his
    siblings, was not properly reasoned.  However, I do not regard this  as
    constituting a material error having regard to the  Judge's  evaluation
    of the evidence as a whole.

51. The Judge went on to note the contents of the email sent by his  mother
    on 26 January 2015 [24]. His mother stated that if he returned he would
    not be permitted to go back to school or to take a  job  in  the  civil
    service or do anything in Iran. In that respect the Judge noted however
    that his mother made no mention of the risk of imprisonment  which  had
    been claimed by the appellant since his screening interview. She  found
    that the mother's concerns are clear and was  not  persuaded  that  his
    fear of treatment amounting to persecution is genuine.  In  any  event,
    even if the risks are genuine, she was not persuaded that  they  amount
    to persecution.

52.  It  is  contended  in  this   regard   that   the   Judge   erred   by
    "misrepresenting" the content of the email. In particular, she did  not
    refer to the part of the email where his mother told him to be  careful
    not to come back, otherwise "the rest of your life  will  be  destroyed
    here." Mr Gayle submitted that anyone reading the email would be  aware
    of the background to the appellant's claim including his risk from  the
    authorities. Moreover, the Judge  failed  to  provide  any  alternative
    reasons for the reference to school expulsion or banning from  a  civil
    service job if returned.

53. As part of her reasoning the Judge noted however that the  respondent's
    call to his mother on the day he was interviewed,  was  monitored.  His
    mother however was not detained [25].   She  also  had  regard  to  the
    content contained in the UN report [26] which I have set out. She found
    that this contradicted the appellant's account of  communications  with
    his mother: If it were likely that the authorities were  interested  in
    his whereabouts they would already be aware  that  he  is  in  the  UK.
    Accordingly, she did not accept that the telephone call would place the
    appellant at risk as he claimed.

54. Notwithstanding Mr Gayle's submission that the report  does  not  state
    that it is 'inevitable' that all emails  will  be  intercepted  by  the
    Iranian authorities, her assessment of the likelihood is sustainable.

55. At [27]the Judge summarised  the  background  against  which  she  gave
    consideration of any risk the appellant might face on return  to  Iran.
    The appellant is an Iranian;  his father was detained  for  anti-regime
    activities;  the family home had been visited by  security  forces  who
    had the opportunity to detain the appellant but chose  not  to  do  so;
    the  appellant  may  have  been  expelled  from  school.  Against  that
    background she found that his presence in the UK has not  worsened  his
    situation in Iran. He will be returned there as a failed asylum  seeker
    who left illegally.

56. In making her findings the Judge had regard to his case set out in  his
    statement made at the time of his claim, dated 26 January 2015, as well
    as his appeal statement dated  13  May  2015  -  [10]  and  [11].  That
    included assertions that his mother had sent him a letter  'explaining'
    that his father remains in detention, p6 para 15;  that  the  telephone
    call by the respondent to his mother was  intercepted  by  the  Iranian
    authorities;  that  his  mother  was   contacted   by   Ettela'at   who
    interrogated her about the call.  She had  been  questioned  about  his
    whereabouts during the numerous raids after he fled. Harassment of  his
    family increased since the interception of that call - p1, para 4.

57. However, no attempt was  made  to  provide  any  witness  statement  or
    information  from  the  appellant's  mother  herself  as  to  what  had
    happened. There was no explanation given as to  why  such  a  statement
    could not have been provided. She had been prepared to send an email to
    the appellant. In the circumstances the Judge was entitled to  note  at
    [25] that there is nothing from his mother  to  confirm  that  she  was
    subsequently questioned.

58. The Judge was properly guided by the findings ' in SB, supra, [28]. She
    concluded, adopting the approach set out  in  the  decision,  that  the
    appellant would not face a real risk of persecution.

59. I have had regard to the risk factors identified at paragraph  [53]  of
    SB. The fact of having exited  illegally  is  not  a  significant  risk
    factor although if it is the case that a person would face difficulties
    with the authorities for other reasons,  such  a  history  could  be  a
    factor adding to the level of difficulties he is likely to face.

60. The appellant did not leave Iran when facing court  proceedings.  There
    is no evidence that he ever faced prosecution for any offence  or  that
    he faced a trial.

61. Nor did he engage in any conduct likely to be seen as insulting  either
    to the judiciary or the justice system, or the government, or to Islam.
    He has not been accused of any anti-Islamic conduct.

62. The high water mark of his case was  that  he  needed  to  protect  his
    mother and siblings on one occasion during  a  raid  on  the  household
    after which he was told that they would arrest him when he  turned  18.
    That particular assertion however has been rejected by  the  Judge  for
    sustainable reasons.

63. In summary, the Judge has given a detailed decision and has made  clear
    findings in relation to the  appellant's  credibility.  She  has  given
    proper reasons for the adverse findings that she  has  made  which  are
    accordingly sustainable in the circumstances.
