Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Cartmel, Counsel instructed by Kingstons
                       Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

        1. The Appellant is a citizen of India who  entered  the  UK  as  a
           student, and whose leave was subsequently varied  as  a  Tier  1
           post study work migrant so that it would  expire  on  21  August
           2014. Within time, the Appellant applied on 21  August  2014  to
           vary his leave once more, on this latter occasion as  a  Tier  1
           (Entrepreneur) migrant.
        2. That  application  was  refused  on  20  October  2014,  and  in
           consequence a decision was made to remove the Appellant from the
           UK by reference to s47.  The  Appellant  duly  appealed  against
           these immigration decisions, and  his  appeal  was  heard  on  3
           September 2015, and  allowed  under  the  Immigration  Rules  by
           decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge Bircher promulgated  on  7
           October 2015.
        3. By a decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge Andrew dated  1  June
           2016 the First Tier Tribunal granted the  Respondent  permission
           to appeal on the basis it was arguable the Judge  had  erred  in
           her approach. It had  been  conceded  before  her,  and  in  the
           application, that the Appellant had not made  an  investment  in
           his business of �50,000 or more before making  his  application.
           There was a shortfall, which he had said in his application  was
           covered by the cash that was available to him to invest in  that
           business, and which he intended to invest in it.
        4. It was however conceded before the Judge that the Appellant  had
           not supplied with his application, or  subsequently  before  the
           date of the Respondent's decision to refuse the application, any
           evidence of the �16,000 in cash  that  he  had  claimed  in  his
           application form to have available  to  him  to  invest  in  his
           business. Thus it was arguable that the Appellant did  not  meet
           the evidential requirements of the Immigration Rules.
        5. The Appellant has filed no Rule 24  response  to  the  grant  of
           permission.
        6. Thus the matter comes before me.


      The Bank statement in question
        7. It is common ground before me that the Judge's finding that  the
           Appellant had demonstrated that he had invested in his  business
           in excess of �50,000 is simply wrong  [29].  That  was  not  his
           case, and it was not borne out by the evidence.
        8. It is also common ground that with his application the Appellant
           had submitted a series of bank statements, numbering 53  sheets,
           for a business account held  in  his  own  name  with  Barclays,
           number  xxxxx8.  No  sheet  was  omitted  from  that  series  of
           statements, and this series of statements did not establish that
           he held the cash that he had claimed to have  available  to  him
           for investment in his  business  in  his  application  form.  Mr
           Cartmel accepted that  his  initial  submission  to  me  to  the
           contrary was misplaced, and that  the  Judge's  finding  to  the
           contrary was also simply wrong [33].
        9. At the hearing before the Judge the Appellant had produced,  for
           the first time, a document that was said to be a true copy of  a
           bank statement for a different account; a current  account  that
           was also held with Barclays, xxxxx4. Mr  Cartmel  accepted  upon
           inspection of this document (he had not  been  provided  with  a
           copy of  it  as  part  of  his  instructions,  although  he  had
           represented the Appellant at the hearing below) that the Judge's
           description of this document as a statement for the  Appellant's
           business account was also factually incorrect [25]. It was  not,
           it was a quite different account, although  the  account  holder
           was also the Appellant, and it was entitled as a current account


       10. In the circumstances the Respondent makes out her case that  the
           Judge approached the appeal on the  wrong  factual  basis  in  a
           number of respects. I am satisfied that  these  errors  of  fact
           were sufficient, both individually and together, to an error  of
           law.

      Paragraph 245AA
       11. Neither representative had attended the hearing with a  copy  of
           the terms in which paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules  was
           cast at the date of the decision. Nor had either of them  sought
           to produce a copy of  any  policy  document  that  they  claimed
           existed outside the Immigration Rules,  which  would  supplement
           paragraph 245AA at the date of decision. Nor were they  equipped
           with copies of any relevant  jurisprudence  concerning  what  is
           generically known as the  Respondent's  "evidential  flexibility
           policy".
       12.  Accordingly  I  stood  the  appeal  down,  and  provided   both
           representatives with copies of the decisions  in  SH  (Pakistan)
           [2016] EWCA Civ 426 and Mandalia [2015] UKSC  59  and  time  for
           them to digest them.
       13. The parties now agree that the date of the decision under appeal
           was 26 August 2014, and that the "process instruction" which was
           the focus of the decision in Mandalia was in force for only  the
           period 7 February - 6 September 2012 [28].  Thus  it  is  agreed
           that it was not applicable to this application by the Appellant,
           or to the Respondent's consideration of it.
       14. It is also agreed between them that at the date of the  decision
           the evidential flexibility policy requirements were set  out  in
           paragraph 245AA of the Immigration  Rules.  The  Respondent  was
           thus obliged to consider only the documents submitted after  the
           application if they were submitted in response to a request made
           of  the  Appellant  to  submit  further  document  pursuant   to
           paragraph 245AA(b). The Respondent was only obliged to make such
           a request in certain  defined  circumstances.  Of  these  it  is
           common ground that only 245AA(b)(i) could be applicable; where a
           document in a sequence had been omitted, as for example  if  one
           bank statement from a  series  was  missing.  There  existed  no
           obligation under paragraph 245AA to give an applicant a  general
           opportunity  to  supplement  their  application  in   situations
           outside those stipulated within paragraph 245AA; SH.
       15. Mr Cartmel did not seek to argue that the evidential flexibility
           policy referred to in SH, which came into force in  March  2013,
           offered any additional assistance to the Appellant. He was in my
           judgement correct not to do so.  Pursuant  to  that  policy  the
           caseworker could only request additional evidence  if  they  had
           sufficient  reason  to  believe  that  the  missing  information
           existed, but the examples given of the  circumstances  in  which
           the caseworker should do so replicated the  terms  of  paragraph
           245AA(b).

      Conclusions
       16. As set out above I am satisfied that the Judge did make  factual
           errors that amounted to errors of law in  her  analysis  of  the
           evidence. The Appellant did not provide with his application the
           evidence required to demonstrate that he met the requirements of
           the Immigration Rules for the variation of leave to remain  that
           he sought. The Judge's conclusion to the contrary  must  be  set
           aside, and the decision upon the appeal remade.
       17. It is conceded before me that the evidence submitted in  support
           of the application did not demonstrate that  the  Appellant  met
           the requirements of the Immigration Rules.
       18. This was a PBS application,  and  thus  s85A  of  the  2002  Act
           disabled the First Tier Tribunal from considering evidence  that
           was not produced by the Appellant in support of his application.
           The document upon which the Appellant's case turns  was  such  a
           document.
       19. Given the factual concessions that are now made (but which  were
           not made by the Appellant before the  Judge  below)  the  appeal
           therefore turns in my judgement upon whether the  Appellant  can
           demonstrate that the omission of the document that was  produced
           to the Judge at the hearing (which is said to be  a  copy  of  a
           statement for account number xxxxx4), from the material provided
           with his application, was such as  to  engage  paragraph  245AA,
           and/or the evidential flexibility policy which came  into  force
           in March 2013.
       20. It is in my judgement plain that the omission of a statement for
           account number xxxxx4 cannot be an omission  from  a  series  of
           documents that relate  to  account  number  xxxxx8.  Mr  Cartmel
           accepted that.
       21. Although Mr Cartmel did not draw my attention to their existence
           during the hearing, and thus he appears to have been unaware  of
           them, I have found upon the file in the course of preparing this
           decision, copy bank statements that do relate to account  number
           xxxx4. I proceed on the basis that they were  submitted  to  the
           Respondent with the application.
       22. These bank statements consist of the following. First, a  series
           of 19 sheets numbered in the top right corner as such, which  is
           complete, and which together covers the period 9 July 2013  -  8
           July 2014. They record  a  closing  credit  balance  of  �2,047.
           Historically they record a credit balance on the  account  which
           has varied from a nominal one to a maximum of �6,300. Second,  a
           series of 3 sheets numbered in the top  right  corner  as  such,
           which is complete, and which together covers the period 26  June
           2014 - 12 August 2014. They record a closing credit  balance  of
           �2,678, with historic movements similar to  those  taking  place
           during the previous twelve months.
       23. These bank statements are therefore a complete  series  for  the
           period 9 July 2013 to 12 August 2014 for account  number  xxxx4.
           They do not indicate that the credit balance on the account  has
           ever reached �16,000  during  that  period,  and  nor  do  their
           contents offer any indication that it would do so at  any  point
           subsequently.
       24. The bank statement for account number xxxx4 which is now  relied
           upon covers the period 17  July  2014  to  19  August  2014.  It
           records a series of transactions in the period 14 August  to  19
           August which (inter alia) credit a number of sums to the account
           derived from a number of sources, so  that  the  closing  credit
           balance on 19 August 2014 was �16,069.62. The material  produced
           with the application, and in  the  application  form,  does  not
           indicate that these credits would be made  to  the  account,  or
           offer an explanation for those which would appear to be  outside
           the ordinary historic usage of the account. I also note that the
           net profit before tax for the Appellant's business in the  eight
           months to 31 July 2014 was a mere �12,105.
       25. Accordingly I find that this was not a "missing  sequence"  case
           as described by Davis LJ in Rodriguez  [2014] EWCA Civ 2 @  102.
           The bank statement now relied upon covered the succeeding period
           to the sequence of statements that  were  provided  for  account
           number xxxx4. It would have been  complete  speculation  on  the
           part of the Respondent to assume that  such  a  statement  might
           show the availability of funds in the requisite sums.  This  was
           not a situation comparable to that in Mandalia.
       26. In the circumstances I am not satisfied that the  Appellant  has
           established  that  the  Respondent  failed  to  properly   apply
           paragraph 245AA,  or,  to  follow  any  applicable  policy  when
           considering the application.
       27. The Appellant's grounds of appeal did not  raise  an  Article  8
           appeal.
       28.  In  the  circumstances,  I  deal  with  Article  8   only   for
           completeness. Even if  Article  8  is  engaged  by  the  removal
           decision under appeal, it could only be engaged in  relation  to
           the Appellant's "private life", since he does not  suggest  that
           he has established any "family life"  in  the  UK.  His  witness
           statement for the appeal made no reference to his "private life"
           beyond his engagement in his business. He  is  plainly  able  to
           return to India in safety.
       29. I note the guidance to be found upon the proper  approach  to  a
           "private life" case in the decisions of Patel  [2013]  UKSC  72,
           and Nasim [2014] UKUT 25. The Appellant  has  only  ever  had  a
           grant of temporary leave for purposes that are now complete. The
           following passage in Nasim sets out the relevant principles;
          "14. Whilst the concept of a "family life" is  generally  speaking
              readily identifiable, the concept of a "private life" for the
              purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear. At one end of
              the "continuum" stands the  concept  of  moral  and  physical
              integrity  or  "physical  and  psychological  integrity"  (as
              categorised by the ECtHR in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002)
              35 EHRR 1) as  to  which,  in  extreme  instances,  even  the
              state's interest in  removing  foreign  criminals  might  not
              constitute a proportionate response. However,  as  one  moves
              down the continuum, one encounters aspects  of  private  life
              which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not alone,  then  in
              combination with other factors) are so far removed  from  the
              "core" of Article 8 as to  be  readily  defeasible  by  state
              interests, such as the importance of maintaining  a  credible
              and coherent system of immigration control.
           15. At this point on the continuum the essential elements of the
              private life relied upon will normally  be  transposable,  in
              the sense of being capable of replication in their  essential
              respects, following a person's return to their home  country.
              Thus, in headnote 3 of MM (Tier 1 PSW; Art 8;  private  life)
              Zimbabwe [2009] UKAIT 0037 we find that:-
               "3. When determining the issue  of  proportionality  ...  it
               will always be important  to  evaluate  the  extent  of  the
               individual's  social  ties  and  relationships  in  the  UK.
               However,  a  student  here  on  a  temporary  basis  has  no
               expectation of a right to remain in order to  further  these
               ties and relationships if the criteria of  the  points-based
               system are not met. Also, the character of  an  individual's
               "private life" relied upon is ordinarily by its very  nature
               of a type which can  be  formed  elsewhere,  albeit  through
               different social ties, after the individual is removed  from
               the UK."
           16.  As  was  stated  in  the  earlier  case  of  MG  (assessing
              interference with private life) Serbia and Montenegro  [2005]
              UKAIT 00113:-
               "A person's job and precise  programme  of  studies  may  be
               different in the country to which he is to be  returned  and
               his network of friendships and other acquaintances is likely
               to be different too, but his private life will  continue  in
               respect of all its essential elements."
           17. The difference between these types of "private life" case and
              a case founded on family life is instructive. As was noted in
              MM, the relationships involved in  a  family  life  are  more
              likely  to  be  unique,  so  as  to  be  incapable  of  being
              replicated once an  individual  leaves  the  United  Kingdom,
              leaving behind, for example,  his  or  her  spouse  or  minor
              child.
           18. In R (on the application of the Countryside Alliance)  v  AG
              and others [2007] UKHL 52, Lord Bingham, having described the
              concept of private life in Article 8 as "elusive", said that:
               "... the purpose of the article is in my view clear.  It  is
               to protect the individual against intrusion by agents of the
               state, unless for  good  reason,  into  the  private  sphere
               within which individuals expect to be left alone to  conduct
               their personal affairs and live their personal lives as they
               choose" [10].
           19. It is important to bear in  mind  that  the  "good  reason",
              which the state must invoke is not a fixity. British citizens
              may enjoy friendships, employment and studies that are in all
              essential respects the same as those enjoyed by persons  here
              who  are  subject  to  such  controls.  The  fact  that   the
              government  cannot  arbitrarily  interfere  with  a   British
              citizen's enjoyment of those things, replicable  though  they
              may be, and that, in practice, interference is likely  to  be
              justified only by strong reasons, such as imprisonment for  a
              criminal offence, cannot be used to restrict the government's
              ability to rely on the enforcement of immigration controls as
              a reason for interfering  with  friendships,  employment  and
              studies enjoyed by a person who  is  subject  to  immigration
              controls.
          20. We therefore agree with Mr  Jarvis  that  [57]  of  Patel  and
              Others is a significant exhortation from the Supreme Court to
              re-focus attention on the nature and  purpose  of  Article  8
              and, in particular, to recognise its limited  utility  to  an
              individual where one has moved along the continuum, from that
              Article's core  area  of  operation  towards  what  might  be
              described as its fuzzy penumbra. The limitation arises,  both
              from what will at  that  point  normally  be  the  tangential
              effect on the individual of  the  proposed  interference  and
              from the fact that, unless there are  particular  reasons  to
              reduce the public interest of enforcing immigration controls,
              that interest  will  consequently  prevail  in  striking  the
              proportionality  balance  (even  assuming   that   stage   is
              reached).
           21. In conclusion on this first general matter, we find that the
              nature of the right asserted by each of the appellants, based
              on their desire, as former students, to undertake a period of
              post-study work in the United  Kingdom,  lies  at  the  outer
              reaches of cases  requiring  an  affirmative  answer  to  the
              second of the five "Razgar" questions and that, even if  such
              an affirmative  answer  needs  to  be  given,  the  issue  of
              proportionality is to be resolved decisively in favour of the
              respondent, by reference to her functions as the guardian  of
              the system of  immigration  controls,  entrusted  to  her  by
              Parliament."
       30. To the extent that the Appellant relies upon his undoubted  good
           character the following passage in Nasim is applicable;
          "25. A further seam running through  the  appellant's  submissions
              was that, during their time in the United Kingdom,  they  had
              been law-abiding, had not relied  on  public  funds  and  had
              contributed to the United Kingdom  economy  by  paying  their
              students' fees. Their aim  was  now  to  contribute  to  that
              economy by working.
           26. We do not consider that this set of  submissions  takes  the
              appellants' cases anywhere. It cannot rationally be contended
              that their Article 8 rights have been  made  stronger  merely
              because, during their time in this  country,  they  have  not
              sought public funds, have refrained from committing  criminal
              offences  and  have  paid  the  fees  required  in  order  to
              undertake their courses. Similarly,  a  desire  to  undertake
              paid employment in the United Kingdom  is  not,  as  such,  a
              matter that can enhance a person's right to  remain  here  in
              reliance on Article 8.
           27. The only significance of not having criminal convictions and
              not  having  relied  on  public  funds  is  to  preclude  the
              respondent from pointing to any public interest in respect of
              the appellants' removal, over and above the basic  importance
              of maintaining a firm  and  coherent  system  of  immigration
              control. However, for reasons we have already enunciated,  as
              a general matter that  public  interest  factor  is,  in  the
              circumstances of these cases, more than  adequate  to  render
              removal proportionate."
       31. To sum up then, the Appellant's appeal did  not  rely  upon  the
           core concepts of moral and physical integrity. In  my  judgement
           the evidence placed before the  Judge  did  not  establish  that
           there were any compelling compassionate circumstances that meant
           the refusal to grant him leave, and the  consequential  decision
           to remove him, led to an unjustifiably  harsh  outcome.  In  the
           light of the provisions of s117A-D, and the guidance to be found
           in AM (s117A-D) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 I am satisfied  that  the
           removal decision is a proportionate response  given  the  public
           interest in the maintenance of immigration controls.
       32. In the circumstances I remake the decision so as to dismiss  the
           appeal.


   DECISION


      The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was promulgated  on
      7 October 2015 did involve the making of an error of law that requires
      that decision to be set aside and remade.


      I remake the decision so as to dismiss the appeal


Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008
      Unless and until the Tribunal  directs  otherwise  the  Appellant  is
        granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or
        indirectly  identify  him.  This  direction  applies  both  to  the
        Appellant and to  the  Respondent.  Failure  to  comply  with  this
        direction could lead to proceedings being brought for  contempt  of
        court.
