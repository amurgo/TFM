Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms A Jones of Counsel instructed by Farani Taylor,
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow of the Specialist Appeals Team

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are wife and husband and their two minor children.  They
    have a third child who is a babe in arms.  They  are  all  citizens  of
    Pakistan. On 4 August 2004 the wife arrived  and  was  given  leave  to
    enter a student. The husband came as her dependant with leave in  line.
    Their leave to remain was extended several times. Their applications of
    23 June 2011 under the Points-Based System were refused on 7  September
    2011. Their appeals were  dismissed  and  their  appeal  rights  became
    exhausted on 6 August 2012.

 2. On 28 March 2013, out of time, they submitted applications for leave to
    remain based on their private and family life which on 16 May 2013 were
    refused with no in-country right of appeal. They did not leave and on 3
    June 2016 they submitted further submissions which were  treated  as  a
    fresh claim and refused on 3 April 2017.

 3. By a decision promulgated on  31  May  2018  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal D Ross dismissed their appeals. On 2 October 2018 Judge of the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Davidge  refused  the  Appellants  permission  to
    appeal. They renewed their application to the Upper Tribunal and on  10
    December 2018 Upper Tribunal Judge Blum, referring to the  judgment  in
    KO (Nigeria) v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53 given on 24  October  2018,  granted
    permission. By a decision promulgated on 1 February 2019 I  found  that
    through no fault of Judge Ross his decision contained a material  error
    of law in the light of the subsequently given judgment of  the  Supreme
    Court in KO.

 4. At the start of the resumed hearing Ms Jones advised  that  the  eldest
    child was  now  over  10  and  had  made  an  application  for  British
    citizenship. She had filed her bio-metrics and her solicitors had  been
    informed by the Respondent that a decision on the application should be
    made within a fortnight or so.

 5. The Appellant's' solicitors had filed the Presidential decision of  the
    Upper Tribunal reported on 4 March 2019 in JG (s. 117B(6):  "reasonable
    to leave" UK) [2019] UKUT 00072 (IAC).

 6. For the Respondent Mr Tarlow quite properly noted the eldest child  was
    now over 10 years of age and there was a reasonable likelihood that the
    child would shortly become a naturalised citizen. He had considered the
    jurisprudence in KO and the extensive guidance given in Sections E  and
    F of JG on the  application  of  the  "best  interests  of  the  child"
    requirement and the meaning of "whether it is reasonable  to  expect  a
    child" to go to  another  country  in  s.117B(6)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended (the 2002 Act). With this in
    mind, there were no further submissions the Respondent could reasonably
    make.

 7. I commended Mr Tarlow for his pragmatic  approach  to  the  appeals.  I
    indicated I did not  need  to  hear  further  from  Ms  Jones  for  the
    Appellants and found for them for reasons which  I  would  give  in  my
    written decision and which now follow.

 8. The eldest child of the lead Appellants was born in the United  Kingdom
    and has always lived here. The child is now over 10 years of  age.  The
    parents' appeals have been founded  on  the  claim  that  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect the eldest child  and  indeed  their  two  other
    children to leave the United Kingdom for Pakistan.

 9. The parents have not established and indeed in  default  have  accepted
    they have no right to remain in the United Kingdom other than by reason
    of their children.

10. I have had particular regard to paragraph 41 of JG which states:-

         We accept that this interpretation may result  in  an  underserving
         individual or family remaining in the United Kingdom.  However, the
         fact that Parliament has mandated  such  an  outcome  merely  means
         that, in such cases, Parliament has decided  to  be  more  generous
         than is strictly required by the Human Rights Act 1998.  It can  be
         regarded as a necessary consequence  of  the  aim  of  Part  5A  of
         imposing greater consistency in decision-making  in  this  area  by
         courts and tribunals.  The fact that section 117B(6)  has  such  an
         aim was expressly recognised by Elias LJ  at  paragraph  44  of  MA
         (Pakistan).

11. I have taken account of what is contained in the Social Worker's report
    in relation to the lead Appellants' oldest child and that  in  relation
    to page 14 of the report I have to take into account as of primary  but
    not paramount importance the best interests of a  child  by  reason  of
    s.55 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

12. While it might be reasonable for the two younger children of  the  lead
    Appellants to leave the United Kingdom  and  continue  their  lives  in
    Pakistan, I conclude it would not be reasonable for their eldest  child
    to leave. There was no claim by the  Respondent  that  there  were  any
    factors adverse to the lead Appellants identified in  Part  VA  of  the
    2002 Act.

13. The Appellants have a family life in the United Kingdom with which  the
    Respondent's decisions amount to an interference of sufficient  gravity
    to engage the State's obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention. In  the  light  of  the  factors  already  mentioned,  such
    interference  is  disproportionate  to  the  need  to  maintain  proper
    immigration control and so, the appeals are allowed.

14. For the reasons referred to in my error of law decision I do  not  find
    there is a need for an anonymity direction.

SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The appeal of each  of  the  Appellants  is  allowed  on  human  rights
    grounds.
    No anonymity direction is made.
