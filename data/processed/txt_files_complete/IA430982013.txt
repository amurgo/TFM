Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms. A. Broklesby Weller, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. Iqbal instructed by Liberty Legal Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent (hereinafter "the claimant") is a citizen of  Bangladesh
    born on 1 January 1983 who entered the UK as a student in 2005.

 2. On 23 April 2013, whilst lawfully in the UK with leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant, the claimant  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (entrepreneur) under the Points Based System.

 3. On 24 September 2013 the claimant was served with Notice  of  liability
    to removal from the UK under Section 10 of the Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 1999 ("1999  Act")  on  the  basis  that  he  had  submitted  false
    documents in support of his application for further  leave  to  remain.
    The Notice stipulated that he had a right of appeal after  leaving  the
    UK.

 4. On 14 October  2013  the  claimant  was  sent  a  letter  refusing  his
    application for a grant of leave to remain.  The  reasons  for  refusal
    were (a) that a  false  document  had  been  submitted  such  that  the
    application fell for refusal under Paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration
    Rules and (b) that the requirements of the Points  Based  System  under
    paragraph 245DD were not satisfied.  The  refusal  letter  stated  that
    there was no right of appeal.

 5. Notwithstanding that it had been made clear in both the refusal  letter
    and Notice of liability to removal that an in-country  appeal  was  not
    permitted, the claimant made such an appeal. In the grounds  of  appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") the  claimant  argued  that  he  was
    entitled to an in country right of  appeal  under  Section  92(2)  with
    reference to Section 82(2) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").

 6. The appeal was heard by FtT Judge Majid. The Secretary of State was not
    represented at the hearing. In a decision promulgated on 19 June  2015,
    the FtT allowed the appeal. It did so without giving any  consideration
    as to whether the claimant had an in-country right of  appeal.  In  the
    first paragraph it stated that the appeal before the FtT concerned  the
    respondent's decision dated 14 October 2013 refusing leave  to  remain.
    No reference was made to the earlier decision under section 10  of  the
    1999 Act.

 7. The grounds of appeal submit that the FtT misdirected itself as to  the
    law in assuming it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Before  me,  Ms
    Broklesby expanded on this, arguing that the FtT had misunderstood  the
    appeal it was deciding as there was no  right  of  appeal  against  the
    decision made on 14 October 2013 in light of the earlier decision under
    Section 10 of the 1999 Act. The appeal of that decision could  only  be
    made once the claimant had left the UK.

 8. Mr Iqbal relied on a detailed Rule 24  Response.  He  argued  that  the
    Secretary of State had never filed an application seeking to argue that
    the  appeal  was  invalid  and  had  not   contested   the   Tribunal's
    jurisdiction and therefore, following Anwar & Anor v SSHD  [2010]  EWCA
    Civ 1275, because the Secretary of State had not taken the jurisdiction
    point , there was no jurisdictional bar.  Before me, Mr  Iqbal  argued,
    inter alia, that where the Secretary of State makes a  decision  giving
    rise to an in country appeal after making a decision  with  an  out  of
    country appeal, the second decision takes priority over the former.

Consideration

 9. It is clear the FtT has misdirected itself as to the law  and  as  such
    made a material error of law. It has proceeded on the  basis  that  the
    matter before it was a refusal decision made on 13 October 2013 whereas
    the decision being appealed was a removal decision under section 10  of
    the 1999 Act made on 24 September 2013. The FtT has moreover failed  to
    give any consideration to the question of whether the claimant  had  an
    in country right of appeal. That this was at  issue  should  have  been
    abundantly  clear  to  the  FtT,  notwithstanding  the  absence  of   a
    representative from the Secretary of State at the hearing, because  (a)
    the Secretary of State's letter to the claimant stipulates there was no
    in country right of appeal and (b) the  claimant's  grounds  of  appeal
    before the FtT dealt extensively with the issue of whether the claimant
    was entitled to an in country right of appeal.

10. Having considered the evidence and submissions, I consider I am able to
    remake the decision without a further hearing and proceed to do  so  as
    follows:

11. At the material time, Section 82 of the 2002  Act  identified  specific
    types of "immigration decision" against  which  there  is  a  right  of
    appeal. These include, at sub paragraphs (d) and (e), and (g)

         (d)  refusal to vary a person's leave to enter  or  remain  in  the
         United Kingdom if the result of the refusal is that the person  has
         no leave to enter or remain,

         (e)  variation of a person's leave to enter or remain in the United
         Kingdom if when the variation takes effect the person has no  leave
         to enter or remain

         (g)  a decision that a person is to  be  removed  from  the  United
         Kingdom by way of directions under section 10(1)(a), (b),  (ba)  or
         (c) of the Immigration and  Asylum  Act  1999  (removal  of  person
         unlawfully in United Kingdom)

12. Appeals that fall under subparagraphs (d) and (e) attract an in-country
    right of appeal under section 92 of  the  2002  Act.  An  appeal  under
    subparagraph (g) does not.

13. The claimant has a right of appeal under subparagraph (g) as a decision
    was made to remove him under section 10 of  the  1999  Act.  The  issue
    before me is whether he also had a right of appeal under  sub-paragraph
    (d) and/or (e) or otherwise.

14. In accordance with well established case law including for  example  RK
    (Nepal) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 359, Mohammad Bilal Jan  v  SSHD  [2014]
    UKUT 265 and most recently  Mehmood & Anor v SSHD [2015] EWCA  Civ  744
    and for the following reasons I find that the claimant's only right  of
    appeal lies under sub-paragraph (g).

15. The decision to remove the claimant was served on 24 September 2013. Up
    until that time he was lawfully present in the United Kingdom.  He  had
    been given leave to remain from 26 April 2011 until 26 April  2013  and
    had applied for further leave on 23 April 2013. Accordingly, the  leave
    which he had been granted in 2011 was extended  by  the  provisions  of
    section 3C of the 1971 Act.

16. Section 10(8) of the 1999 Act states that: "Directions for the  removal
    of a person given under this section invalidate any leave to  enter  or
    remain in the United Kingdom given to him  before  the  directions  are
    given or while they are in force." In Mehmood the Court  of  Appeal  at
    paragraph [35] clarified  that the effect of  section  10(8)  is  that,
    from the date of the notification, "that which had previously been done
    is undone".

17. Accordingly, the claimant's leave to remain was invalidated pursuant to
    section 10(8) of the 1999 Act when the decision to remove him was  made
    on 24 September 2013. From that time onwards he could not have a  right
    of appeal under either subparagraphs (d) and (e), as he  did  not  have
    any extant leave to be varied. The Section  10  removal  notice  having
    previously been served, the Secretary of State was correct to state  in
    its refusal letter sent on 14 October 2013 that there was no  right  of
    appeal against that decision.

18. Accordingly, the claimant's only right of appeal is against the section
    10 decision under section 82(2)(g) of the 2002 Act,  and  he  does  not
    have an in-country right of  appeal  under  section  82(2)(d),  (e)  or
    otherwise.

19. Mr Iqbal contended that because the Secretary of State had  not  raised
    the jurisdiction point there was no jurisdictional bar. I do not accept
    this argument. I agree with Mr Iqbal that the Secretary  of  State  did
    not file an application with respect  to  jurisdiction  or  attend  the
    hearing and raise the objection there. However, that does not  mean  it
    accepted jurisdiction. Its position in this regard was set out  in  the
    Notice to the claimant on 24  September  2013  where  it  unambiguously
    stated that the claimant could only appeal after leaving the UK. In any
    event, as made clear in Virk & Ors v SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  652,  the
    First tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal are creations of  statute  whose
    jurisdiction is limited by section 82 of the 2002 Act. As in Virk  (see
    paragraph [23] of that  judgment),  although  decisions  taken  without
    jurisdiction may in due course become irreversible, that point has  not
    been reached in this case and  it  is  my  finding  that  there  is  no
    jurisdiction for this appeal to be heard whilst the claimant is in  the
    UK.

Decision

20. For the aforementioned reasons I set aside the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal because it involved the making of  a  material  error  of
    law. I remake the decision and dismiss the claimant's appeal.

21. No anonymity order is made.
