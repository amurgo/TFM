                                   Between

                                 master R N
                         (anonymity direction made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Smith, Counsel, instructed by Paragon Law
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     UPON hearing from Ms Smith of Counsel for the  Appellant  and  from  Mr
    Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer for the Respondent

     AND UPON considering: the decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Broe dated 19 March 2018 dismissing the Appellant's appeal against  the
    decision of the Respondent dated 6 May  2016  refusing  his  protection
    claim; the Appellant's grounds of appeal dated 3 April 2018 and renewed
    grounds of appeal dated 11 May 2018; and the  grant  of  permission  to
    appeal by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Saffer dated 20 August 2018

     AND UPON it being agreed between the parties that:

     (i) at paragraph 24 of his decision the judge found that the  Appellant
    faced a real risk of serious harm from the Taliban in his home area  of
    Langman Province;

     (ii)     whereas the judge was silent as to whether  or  not  any  such
    risk arose for reason of a Refugee Convention reason, the risk  to  the
    Appellant in Langman Province arose for reason of his imputed political
    opinion;

     (iii) the  judge  thereafter  held  that  there  would  exist  for  the
    Appellant a real risk of  serious  harm  upon  any  attempted  internal
    relocation to Kabul, the Appellant thereby surpassing  the  requirement
    that he establish that internal relocation  would  be  unreasonable  or
    unduly harsh;

     (iv) that such risk of harm in Kabul would also exist for  the  Refugee
    Convention  reason  of  the  Appellant's  age;   being   an   immutable
    characteristic.

     AND UPON the Tribunal being satisfied that it is  appropriate  to  make
    such an order.

     IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, by consent,  under  Rule  39  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 that:

    (1)  The decision is set aside.


    (2)  The appeal is allowed under the Refugee Convention.
