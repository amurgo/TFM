                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Albania born on 10th May  1985.   He
    applied for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  Migrant  on
    9th July 2013.  That application was refused for the reasons given in a
    Notice of Decision dated 15th August 2013.  The Appellant appealed, and
    his appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Saffer  (the  Judge)
    sitting at Bradford on 19th December 2013.  He decided to  dismiss  the
    appeal for the reasons given in his Determination of  that  date.   The
    Appellant sought leave to appeal that decision,  and  on  14th  January
    2014 such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The application for leave to remain was refused because  the  Appellant
    failed to  show  that  he  had  the  requisite  funds  to  satisfy  the
    provisions of paragraph 1A of Appendix C of HC 395.  This decision  was
    taken on the basis of  statements  produced  of  the  Appellant's  bank
    account with Lloyds TSB.

 4. The Judge dismissed the appeal because having considered the statements
    from Lloyds Bank TSB he found that the Appellant's funds fell below the
    required level of ï¿½1,600 for a four day period during the 28 day period
    prior to the application having been submitted.

 5. Leave to appeal was granted  on  the  basis  that  the  Judge  had  not
    considered the funds held by the Appellant in a separate  account  with
    Barclays Bank.  There is no evidence in the file  that  any  statements
    relating to that bank account were submitted with the  application  for
    leave to remain.  At the hearing, Mr Oliver conceded  that  that  being
    the case, the Judge did not err in law in making his decision.

 6. Section 85A(4) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    provides that in a Points Based System  case,  the  Tribunal  may  only
    consider evidence adduced by the  Appellant  if  it  was  submitted  in
    support of, and at the time of making, the  application  to  which  the
    immigration decision related.  It is common ground that that being  the
    case the Judge could not have taken it into account the funds  held  by
    the Appellant with Barclays Bank in deciding the appeal.   I  therefore
    find that there is no error of law in the Judge's decision which  I  do
    not set aside.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.









Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  I  find  no
reason to do so.
