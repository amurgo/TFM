For the claimant: Mr A Jafar, instructed by Kothala & Co
For the respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Chapman  promulgated  17.2.15,  allowing,  on
    human rights grounds, the claimant's appeal against the decision of the
    Secretary of State, dated 19.11.14, to refuse her application  made  on
    5.6.14 for settlement on  the  basis  of  10  years  continuous  lawful
    residence, pursuant to paragraph 276B of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
    Judge heard the appeal on 2.2.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Saffer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.4.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 5.6.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  Mr Jaffar was content to proceed to deal with the  error  of
    law hearing in the absence of the appellant.

 4. It transpired at the hearing before me on 23.7.15  that  neither  party
    had received or seen the error of law decision. It is  not  clear  why.
    However, both sides were given a copy that I  printed  off  immediately
    prior to the decision and allowed time to consider the decision  before
    proceeding.

 5. At noted at �5 to �7 of my error of law decision  Judge  Chapman  found
    that:

      a) The claimant could not meet the requirements of paragraph 276B  for
         long residence because she had remained in the  UK  without  lawful
         leave for a period in excess of 28 days;

      b) The Secretary of State was entitled to exercise her  discretion  to
         refuse the application under paragraph  322(2),  because  of  false
         representations in a previous application;

      c) The claimant did not meet the requirements of paragraph  276ADE  in
         respect of  private  life,  as  there  were  not  very  significant
         obstacles to her integration into South Africa.

 6. I noted in my error of law decision that there had been  no  appeal  or
    cross appeal against any of those findings and that they must therefore
    stand, and the appeal remains dismissed on  immigration  grounds.  What
    was placed in issue by the appeal of the Secretary  of  State  was  the
    allowing of the appeal on human  rights  grounds,  notwithstanding  the
    claimant's  immigration  history,  including  the  finding   that   the
    appellant had previously used deception in an immigration application.

 7. For the reasons set out in my decision  dated  11.6.15,  I  found  that
    there was such error of law in the making of the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal that the decision of Judge Chapman should be set aside to
    be remade. In essence, I  found  the  article  8  ECHR  proportionality
    assessment was flawed in attaching positive weight  in  the  claimant's
    favour to her immigration history  and  failing;  failing  to  properly
    recognise that her status in the UK was precarious and/or unlawful; and
    failing to give appropriate  weight  to  the  use  of  deception  in  a
    previous application and remaining in the UK without lawful leave since
    23.12.12. On that history, I found that it was manifestly  perverse  to
    treat the  claimant  as  being  generally  compliant  with  immigration
    control.  I  also  found  that  there  were  insufficient  reasons   to
    demonstrate that, in the absence of partner  or  dependent  child,  the
    claimants relations with her adult children were anything more than the
    normal emotional ties to be expected between such relatives  and  which
    do not in the normal course of affairs require the  continued  presence
    of the claimant in the UK.

 8. I then adjourned the remaking of the decision in the appeal,  retaining
    and preserving the findings  not  in  issue,  as  set  out  above,  and
    directing that the single issue in the  remaking  of  the  decision  is
    whether it is necessary to conduct an assessment outside the  Rules  on
    the basis of private and/or family life under article 8  ECHR,  and  if
    so, the basis of that assessment. I issued directions for  the  service
    of

 9. At  the  outset  of  the  hearing  on  23.7.15,  Mr  Jaffar  sought  an
    adjournment in order, he said, to  cross-appeal  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal on the issues  listed  above,  asserting  that  the
    evidence that was before the Tribunal demonstrated that there had  been
    no deception on the  part  of  the  claimant  and  that  therefore  the
    application should not have been refused under paragraph 322(2) of  the
    Immigration Rules.

10. I refused the adjournment application, made at this  very  late  stage.
    The claimant did not apply at any stage for permission  to  appeal  the
    dismissal of the appeal on immigration grounds. Mr Jaffar  had  conduct
    of the appeal at the error of law hearing  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  on
    5.6.15 and did not raise any such issue then and was content to proceed
    with the error of law hearing in the absence of  his  lay  client.  Any
    application now would be grossly  out  of  time  and  in  my  view  any
    application  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  permission  to  appeal
    unlikely to succeed. However, I pointed out  that  as  I  had  set  the
    decision aside and that this hearing was to remake that decision it was
    still open to him to demonstrate within this hearing that the  decision
    of  the  Secretary  of  State  relying  on  paragraph  322(1A)  of  the
    Immigration Rules was not in accordance with the law.

11. Mr Jaffar then took me to the evidence, in particular that relating  to
    social services or social work, which he  submitted  demonstrated  that
    there had been no deception on the part of the claimant  and  that  the
    application  should  not  have  been  refused.  However,  having  given
    consideration to that evidence, as set out below, I  am  not  satisfied
    that it makes the point he claims.

12. The detailed immigration history is set out in the refusal decision  of
    19.11.14 but the relevant history can be briefly summarised as follows.
    The claimant first arrived in the UK in 2000 with leave as  a  visitor.
    Subsequently she was granted leave to remain as a student, later varied
    to  work  permit  employment,  valid  until  23.12.10.  On  8.6.11  the
    Secretary  of  State  refused  a  further  in-time  work   permit   ILR
    application. When the claimant appealed, the  decision  was  withdrawn,
    for the purpose of remaking it with consideration under section  55  of
    the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009  of  the  dependents
    listed in the claimant's application. The application was then  refused
    on 3.8.11.The  claimant's  appeal  against  that  reconsidered  refusal
    decision was allowed to the limited extent that it  was  "remitted"  to
    the Secretary of State to consider paragraph 276B  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, with regard to the claimant's length of residence in the UK. The
    refusal decision was upheld in the decision  issued   6.3.12,  and  the
    claimant became appeal rights exhausted (ARE) on 23.3.12.  Her  out  of
    time application to appeal was refused, and  time  to  appeal  was  not
    extended.

13. Since then, the claimant made an out of time application on 9.5.14  for
    Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) on the basis  of  long  residence  was
    rejected as invalid. The application that is the subject of this appeal
    was lodged on 5.6.14.

14. It follows from the above that the claimant has had no legal  basis  to
    remain in the UK  since  23.3.12,  yet  she  has  remained  in  the  UK
    unlawfully.

15. The refusal decision of 19.11.14 sets out the issue Mr Jaffar now takes
    issue with.  The  claimant's  previous  application  for  ILR  made  in
    December 2010 was refused under paragraph 322(1A). She  had  stated  in
    that application that KN (male) and KN (female) were her dependents and
    that they lived with her. The  refusal  decision  of  19.11.14  states,
    "However, a social  services  report  determined  that  the  dependents
    listed had not lived with you since 2007 and were residing with another
    family member. In view of this the Secretary  of  State  was  satisfied
    that  you  had  made  false  representations  in   relation   to   your
    application. In light of this, your current application for  settlement
    has been refused under paragraph 322(2) of the Immigration Rules."

16. A copy of the refusal decision of 6.3.12 is with the case papers.  This
    states that, "On 26 January 2011 a social  services  report  determined
    that the children had not lived with you since 2007. In  view  of  this
    the  Secretary  of  State  is  satisfied  that  you  have  made   false
    representations in relation to your application." Later in the  refusal
    decision it is stated, " It is noted that you do not  hold  a  criminal
    record, however you declared  that  two  of  your  dependants  on  this
    application lived with  you,  but  you  informed  social  services,  as
    outlined in their report of 26 January 2011, that the children had  not
    lived with you since 2007. This somewhat discredits your character."

17. A copy of that application is with the case papers. Section  2  states,
    "If you have a partner and/or any children under 18 who are living with
    you in the UK and who are applying for indefinite leave  to  remain  as
    your dependents, this is where you give their  details."  The  claimant
    has then set out the details of the two children referred to above. The
    application also shows that she was applying in the  category  of  work
    permit holder. It is quite plain that the application was made  on  the
    basis that these two children, together with a third child name in  the
    application, were living with the claimant. That was patently untrue.

18. Mr Jaffar relies on various documents to  try  to  draw  a  distinction
    between some kind of joint family responsibility for these children and
    the refusal based on  false  representations  that  the  children  were
    living with her. I find no merit in this submission and do  not  accept
    that the documents reveal what Mr Jaffar claimed.

19. An email of 13.1.11 relating to a fostering assessment for the children
    reveals that on a visit of 12.1.11  the  claimant  claimed  to  be  the
    guardian of the children. It became clear that (the  claimant)  is  not
    the carer for the children. She told us that since  the  children  have
    been in the UK they have lived with another of their cousins  and  they
    spend school holidays with her." However, she was unable  to  name  the
    school they attended. The email confirms that the  children  had  never
    lived with her on any permanent basis, but she maintained they did stay
    with her at times. It wasn't clear where they would sleep if they did.

20. There is a very small typeface assessment report. This states that  the
    children came to the UK in 2004 and originally lived with the  claimant
    but in 2007 moved to live with another cousin in  Hemel  Hempstead.  It
    also states that the children are supported  by  two  other  relatives,
    part of the extended family and that the claimant was expecting to look
    after them again when her own children have left home. It suggests that
    the female child was being looked after by a  different  cousin,  "with
    support from three other relatives who she describes as 'aunts'  as  is
    common in her culture." It appears to have been this report  which  was
    referred to in the refusal decision.

21. I take the point that the cultural background may mean that a number of
    relatives participate or have some part of the responsibility  for  the
    care of children whose own mother has died, but that is a far different
    situation from a quite obviously dishonest assertion in the application
    form that the children were dependents living with her. I  also  reject
    as unfounded any suggesting that  she  was  in  any  real  sense  joint
    parenting the children. It is obvious she didn't even know what  school
    they attended. Neither  does  having  the  children  stay  occasionally
    amount to parental control, regardless of the so-called cultural  norms
    of Zulu  culture.  I  have  taken  into  consideration  the  claimant's
    assertion that she didn't intend to deceive and that it  was  simply  a
    misunderstanding. I have also considered Mr  Jaffar's  suggestion  that
    the claimant stood to gain nothing from the  deception,  but  I  reject
    that explanation as clearly inconsistent with the application made.

22. In the circumstances, there is  absolutely  no  merit  in  Mr  Jaffar's
    submission on this point. I do not accept  that  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State was made in error of fact. I find to a high standard
    of proof that the claimant did make false representations and that  the
    former application was thus correctly refused under  paragraph  322(1A)
    and in consequence the application that is the subject of  this  appeal
    was  also  refused,  in  reliance   on   paragraph   322(2).   In   the
    circumstances, I find that the decision was correctly made with  regard
    to this issue.

23. Since 23.3.12 the claimant has had no lawful basis to be or  remain  in
    the UK, her appeal rights being exhausted at that date. Her  subsequent
    application for leave to remain on the  basis  of  long  residence  was
    lodged over 800 days after the expiry of even her section 3C leave. She
    has remained in the UK in breach of immigration laws.

24. Before considering private and family life issues, the  sole  remaining
    issue in the appeal, I have first considered the Immigration Rules.

25. As explained in the refusal decision, the claimant does  not  meet  the
    long residence requirements of paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules,
    even though she had accrued a period  of  10  years  continuous  lawful
    residence, as she does not meet the character and conduct  requirements
    of that provision, because of her attempted deception in  her  December
    2010 application. In addition, she falls for refusal under the  general
    grounds of refusal, and  because  of  her  illegal  status  she  cannot
    satisfy the requirement of 276B((v) that she must not be in the  UK  in
    breach of immigration law.

26. The claimant does not have a child under 18 or a partner in the UK  and
    it is clear that she cannot therefore meet the requirements of Appendix
    FM in respect of family life.

27. Neither does the claimant meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE  of
    the Immigration Rules in respect of private life. It seems to  me  that
    the Secretary of State may have relied on the suitability requirements,
    but did not do so. Instead, it is clear that the claimant has not lived
    in the UK continuously for 20 years but cannot demonstrate  that  there
    would be very significant obstacles to her integration in South Africa.
    She has not lived there since 2000, but she spent the majority  of  her
    life there. I note that she has friends and family in the UK, but I  do
    not accept that she has no ties remaining with South Africa. There  may
    be difficulties in reintegrating given her absence since 2008 (the date
    of her last visit), but I do  not  find  that  these  can  properly  be
    described as very significant. She has trained as a health professional
    in the UK, although she has had no right to work here since  2012,  and
    thus will be  able  to  use  her  skills  and  qualifications  to  seek
    employment in South Africa. The  Immigration  Rules  do  not  guarantee
    employment or the same social and economic conditions the claimant  has
    enjoyed in the UK, including the 3 years since 2015 that she  has  been
    her illegally. She also owns property in the UK, which can be  realised
    to help establish herself in South Africa.

28. In the claimant's favour I have, amongst other factors set out  herein,
    taken particular attention of the following non-exhaustive list:

      a) That the claimant has been in the UK since 2000, and came here  and
         remained entirely lawfully until 2012. However,  as  stated  herein
         the fact that she complied with immigration laws is  not  a  factor
         that can enhance her article 8 rights;

      b) That the claimant used her time in the UK to  become  educated  and
         gain employment as a qualified nurse. She is a specialist in autism
         and aspergers syndrome, with a master's degree;

      c) The claimant worked for the NHS and purchased her own home in  2003
         and is therefore considerably settled in the UK;

      d) That the claimant has some health  issues,  including  hypertension
         and heart palpitations;

      e) That most of the claimant's family is in the UK and  that  she  has
         either no or very limited family members still  residing  in  South
         Africa;

      f) That the claimant holds her then legal advisor for failure to lodge
         in time an appeal against the refusal decision of 6.3.12.  However,
         for the reasons set out herein, I have  found  that  there  was  no
         merit in the argument the claimant wanted to raise in that appeal;

      g) That the claimant has had some sort of involvement with  or  taking
         of part of the responsibility for the two children, and thus  there
         will be a degree of emotional relationship between them;

      h) That the claimant has adult children and grandchildren  settled  in
         the UK. I accept that and that they are a close  family,  of  which
         there is no reason to doubt,  especially  since  the  claimant  has
         effectively been a one-parent family and I accept that from time to
         time they visit and perhaps stay with each other;.

      i)  I  accept  that  the  claimant  has  the  relationship  with   her
         grandchildren she describes in her witness statement. However, that
         is no more than one might expect in the circumstances and does  not
         amount to family life that is protected by Appendix FM;

      j) That the claimant has some form of  romantic  relationship  with  a
         British citizen. However, they no longer live together, even though
         the claimant states she hopes that they will soon marry;

29. I have also given carefully consideration  to  the  claimant's  witness
    statement and the statements of others on her behalf.

30. Before  addressing  article  8  ECHR  and  the  Razgar  proportionality
    assessment, I should consider  whether  the  private  and  family  life
    circumstances of the claimant  are  so  compelling  and  insufficiently
    recognised in the Immigration Rules so as to render the decision of the
    Secretary of State unjustifiably harsh so as to require, exceptionally,
    the appeal to be allowed outside the Rules under article 8 ECHR.

31. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the Court of  Appeal  held
    that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a
    complete code but involve the application of  a  proportionality  test.
    Whether that is done within the new rules or outside the new  rules  as
    part of the article 8 general law was described as a sterile  question,
    as either way the result should be  the  same;  what  matters  is  that
    proportionality balancing exercise  is  required  to  be  carried  out.
    However, if the Rules have already adequately addressed the private and
    family life circumstances, there is no purpose in doing so again  under
    article 8 ECHR.

32. This approach has subsequently been endorsed by the Court of Appeal  in
    Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74, and again in SSHD v SS (Congo)  &  Ors
    [2015] EWCA Civ 387, where the Court of Appeal held that  it  is  clear
    that whilst the assessment of Article 8  claims  requires  a  two-stage
    analysis, and there is no  threshold  or  intermediary  requirement  of
    arguability before a decision maker moves to consider the second stage,
    whether that second stage is required will depend on  whether  all  the
    issues have been adequately addressed under the Rules. In other  words,
    there is no need to conduct a full separate examination  of  article  8
    outside the Rules where in the circumstances of a particular case,  all
    issues have been addressed in the consideration under the Rules.

33. More significantly, in SS (Congo), after reviewing the authorities, the
    Court of Appeal stated, "It is clear,  therefore,  that  it  cannot  be
    maintained as a  general  proposition  that  LTR  or  LTE  outside  the
    Immigration Rules should only be granted in exceptional cases. However,
    in certain specific contexts, a proper application  of  Article  8  may
    itself make it clear that the legal  test  for  grant  of  LTR  or  LTE
    outside the Rules should indeed be a test of exceptionality.  This  has
    now been identified to be the  case,  on  the  basis  of  the  constant
    jurisprudence of the ECtHR itself, in relation to applications for  LTR
    outside the Rules on the basis of family life (where  no  children  are
    involved) established in the United Kingdom at a time when the presence
    of one or other of the partners was known to be precarious: see  Nagre,
    paras. [38]-[43], approved by this court in MF (Nigeria) at [41]-[42]."



34. The claimant is not even in as  strong  a  position  as  that  outlined
    above, having no family life with a partner and her private life having
    always been precarious.

35. Whilst there was  no  proportionality  assessment  under  Appendix  FM,
    though there was a full paragraph 276ADE private  life  assessment,  as
    stated above, the tests under the Rules, designed from 2012 to  be  the
    Secretary of State's response to private and  family  life  claims  are
    relevant and helpful in establishing where the balance lies between the
    rights of the claimant and the public interest in immigration  control.
    Under EX1 as defined under EX2, the claimant would  have  had  to  show
    insurmountable obstacles to any family life continuing outside the  UK.
    She claims to have been in a relationship with a British  national  for
    about 5 years but admits that she is not currently living with him  and
    thus there is no family life with a partner  to  found  an  application
    under the Rules. That she has employment and family members in  the  UK
    and does not want to relocate to  South  Africa  does  not  demonstrate
    insurmountable obstacles or significant difficulties she would face  in
    continuing family life with a partner outside the UK  and  which  could
    not be overcome or would entail very serious  hardship  for  either  of
    them.

36. Similarly, in relation to private life,  I  have  first  to  take  into
    account that pursuant to section  117B  of  the  2002  Act  immigration
    control is deemed by statute to be in the public interest, and that  as
    her status has been precarious  throughout,  little  weight  should  be
    given to any private life the claimant has developed whilst in the  UK,
    even though she  was  here  with  leave  until  2012.  As  far  as  her
    relationship with a British citizen, he is not required to leave the UK
    and it will be his choice whether to do so in  order  to  continue  any
    relationship, though it cannot be presently described as  family  life.
    In any event, I am not satisfied that  the  claimant  has  demonstrated
    anything which could be properly described as family life to the extent
    that the removal decision would  engage  article  8  ECHR  as  a  grave
    interference. In  relation  to  any  prospective  relationship  with  a
    British citizen, on the basis of section 117B, little weight should  be
    given to such a relationship given that her immigration status has been
    unlawful since 2012.

37. There is nothing in her circumstances that is  particularly  compelling
    to justify, exceptionally, allowing the appeal outside the Rules  under
    article 8 ECHR on the  basis  that  otherwise  the  decision  would  be
    unjustifiably harsh. In reaching this conclusion,  I  have  taken  into
    account all the information and evidence now present in the case papers
    before me and in particular those matters urged upon me by  Mr  Jaffar,
    as well as the factors specifically referenced in this decision.

38. However, even in conducting the Razgar stepped approach  to  article  8
    private and family life, I  am  satisfied,  for  the  reasons  set  out
    herein, that the proportionality balancing exercise between on the  one
    hand the rights of the claimant  and  her  extended  family,  including
    adult children and grandchildren, and on the other the  legitimate  and
    necessary aim of protecting the economic well-being of the  UK  through
    immigration  control,  falls  firmly  in  favour  of  removal  and  the
    conclusion that removal is proportionate and  not  disproportionate  to
    the rights of the claimant and her family.

39. In reaching that conclusion, I also bear in mind that article 8 is  not
    a shortcut to compliance with Immigration Rules  and  claimant  is  not
    entitled to remain in the UK just because that is  now  her  desire  or
    choice. I also have to bear in mind as a significant factor  in  favour
    of removal the claimant's attempted  deception  in  her  December  2010
    application. Her immigration history provides little assistance, having
    remained her since 2012 without any lawful basis to do so.  It  is  not
    clear how she  manages  to  support  herself,  unless  she  is  working
    illegally, given that she has had no right to work since 2012  and  has
    significant outgoings including a mortgage to pay. As stated above, her
    immigration status has always been  precarious  and  thus  pursuant  to
    section 117B little weight accrues to any private life considerations.

40. Although I have set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  the
    findings in relation to the  Immigration  Rules  are  preserved.  These
    includes findings that the claimant has previously used deception  and,
    at both �31 and �33, that  her  evidence  attempting  to  justify  that
    deception was not credible. The claimant had previously fabricated  the
    appearance of family life by claiming to  live  with  two  children  as
    their guardian. This was dishonest. It would in  the  circumstances  be
    manifestly perverse to treat the claimant as being generally  compliant
    with immigration control.

41. In respect of the claimant's relationship with her adult  children,  or
    her three grandchildren, there is insufficient evidence to  demonstrate
    that these relationships are anything more than  the  normal  emotional
    ties between such relatives, which in the normal course of  affairs  do
    require the continued presence of the claimant  in  the  UK.  That  the
    claimant's wider family network is in the UK is not a cogent reason for
    allowing the appeal on family life grounds. She came to  the  UK  as  a
    visitor and later was granted leave to remain as a  student  and  later
    still under a work permit. However, she became appeal rights  exhausted
    on 6.3.12 and did not make the present application until over two years
    later, on 5.6.14. It is clear that the claimant has been determined  to
    remain in the UK despite having no proper basis to do so.

Conclusion & Decision:

42. In all the circumstances and for the reasons set  out  herein,  I  find
    that the claimant does not meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Neither have I found the decision disproportionate to the family
    and private life rights of the claimant or her family  members  in  the
    UK.

                    The appeal is dismissed on both  immigration  and  human
                    rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
