Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Spurling of Counsel instructed by Sriharans
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka  born  on  31  July  1990.   He
    entered the UK together with his mother clandestinely on 8 March  2007.
    The appellant's mother claimed asylum shortly after  arrival  with  her
    son as her dependant.  This application was refused on  10  April  2007
    and the appeal against the decision  was  dismissed  on  22  May  2007.
    Shortly  after  the  appellant  reached   the   age   of   18   further
    representations were made on 28 August 2008.  The case was moved to the
    older live cases unit under the legacy criteria.  On  26  January  2016
    the respondent sent  a  further  submissions  decision  letter  to  the
    appellant's mother in which she concluded that she did not qualify  for
    leave on any basis.  No direct mention of the appellant's inclusion  as
    a dependant on his mother's initial claim was made.  On 8 February 2016
    the appellant's mother was granted discretionary leave to remain in the
    UK until 26 July 2018 but the appellant was not granted leave  in  line
    with his mother.

2.   An asylum claim was lodged in his own right  by  the  appellant  on  18
    April 2016.  The claim was refused and certified on  16  October  2016.
    Judicial review proceedings were issued on 16 January 2017.   The  Home
    Office agreed to reconsider the  matter.   The  application  was  again
    refused on 27 April 2018.  The appellant gave notice of  appeal  on  14
    May 2018.  The appellant's appeal came before a First-tier Judge  on  1
    February 2019.  At the outset of the hearing Counsel then  representing
    the appellant informed the judge that the asylum  claim  would  not  be
    pursued.  The appeal would proceed on the basis of Article 8 only  both
    within and outside the Rules.

3.   It is argued in the grounds that the  appellant  should  have  had  the
    benefit of the same Asylum Policy Instruction (API) as applied  to  his
    mother and that he had been prejudiced by delay: The  First-tier  Judge
    dealt with these matters in the concluding paragraphs of her decision:

         "45. As previously noted, on 8 February 2016 Mrs  [C]  was  granted
             Discretionary Leave to remain in the UK until 26 July 2018.  A
             further grant of DL was made to Mrs [C] on 8 January 2019  and
             she now has limited leave to remain in the UK  until  14  June
             2021.  Mr Gilbert drew my attention to the API Dependants  and
             former dependants (May 2014) which states at paragraph 3.8:

                  'Any dependant, who is currently under 18 and was included
                  in the original  asylum  or  human  rights  claim,  should
                  continue to be treated as a dependant  until  any  further
                  submissions are concluded.

                  Any dependant included in the  original  asylum  or  human
                  rights  claim,  who  reaches   18   before   the   further
                  submissions are decided, should normally  continue  to  be
                  treated as a dependant for the  purposes  of  the  further
                  submissions application.'

             I am aware that in granting permission to apply  for  Judicial
             Review Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic said:

                  "It is arguable that given the wording of the respondent's
                  policy on discretionary leave that  the  applicant  should
                  have  been  treated  as  a  dependant  when  his  mother's
                  submissions were considered even though he was 18  at  the
                  time or that reasons should  have  been  provided  by  the
                  respondent for why he was not so  treated.   There  is  no
                  reference in paragraph 3.8 of the  policy  guidance  to  a
                  requirement that further submissions, in  connection  with
                  an earlier asylum claim must be made whilst the  dependant
                  of the main applicant is still under  18.   Arguably,  the
                  respondent failed to follow her policy.   The  absence  of
                  any enforcement action against the applicant when  he  was
                  seen by an immigration officer in 2009 and  the  grant  of
                  permission to work  in  2015  are  matters  which  further
                  suggest that the respondent was still treating him as  his
                  mother's dependant during that time."

             However, with the utmost respect my view differs from that  of
             Judge Kekic; I consider that the dependant in  question  needs
             to be under the age of 18 as at  the  date  that  the  further
             submissions are lodged.  The second paragraph of 3.8 refers to
             "the further submissions" not "any further  submissions",  and
             so must relate to the further submissions alluded  to  in  the
             first paragraph, i.e. those submitted when the  dependant  was
             under 18.  When Mrs [C]'s further submissions were  lodged  on
             28 August 2008 [per Statement of Facts  at  AB  page  183  and
             Counsel's skeleton  argument  at  paragraph  6]  her  son  had
             already attained the age of  majority.   In  my  judgment  the
             Appellant did not fall within the ambit  of  the  Respondent's
             policy.

         46.  In her Decision Notice Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic went on:

                  "It  is  also  arguable  that  the  respondent  failed  to
                  consider  relevant  matters  when  assessing  whether  the
                  applicant's circumstances merited a grant of discretionary
                  leave.  Matters  such  as  the  seven-year  delay  in  the
                  respondent's decision making process which led to a  grant
                  of discretionary leave for his  mother,  his  entry  as  a
                  minor with his mother,  his  continued  cohabitation  with
                  her, his birth and  upbringing  in  Bahrain  and  not  Sri
                  Lanka, the absence of ties and  familial  support  in  Sri
                  Lanka and his inability to read and write Tamil  were  not
                  taken into account."

         47.  Counsel submitted that the Secretary  of  State's  "egregious"
             seven-year delay in considering the further  submissions  made
             in August 2008, taken  in  conjunction  with  her  failure  to
             address the Appellant's status as an overstayer, permitted his
             client to develop deeper ties  both  to  the  UK  and  to  his
             mother, and further distanced him from Sri Lanka (which was  a
             country in which he had never lived in any  event).   He  said
             that this was a factor mitigating against  the  weight  to  be
             attached to immigration  control;  it  was  pertinent  that  a
             person's presence had been tolerated for a lengthy  period  of
             time over which  they  developed  strong  family,  social  and
             cultural ties notwithstanding that for a large  part  of  that
             period it was open to the authorities to remove them: Jeunesse
             v Netherlands [2016] 60 EHRR 17 cited.

         48.   I  note  that  in   Jeunesse   v   Netherlands   "exceptional
             circumstances" were found to exist because  of  a  variety  of
             factors, including the fact that the case  involved  a  family
             with children, where the husband and children of the applicant
             were all Dutch nationals and had a right to enjoy their family
             life with each  other  in  the  Netherlands  where  they  were
             "deeply rooted".  Furthermore, the applicant  had  held  Dutch
             nationality at birth but  subsequently  lost  her  nationality
             when Suriname became independent; 'Consequently, her  position
             cannot be simply considered to be on a par with  that  of  the
             other potential immigrants who  have  never  held  Netherlands
             nationality.'  As the court put it, in view of the  particular
             circumstances of the case, it was questionable whether general
             immigration considerations could  be  regarded  as  sufficient
             justification for refusing the applicant residence in the host
             state [�121].

         49.   The  European  court's  use  of   the   phrase   "exceptional
             circumstances" in this context was considered by the Court  of
             Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192.   Lord
             Dyson MR, giving the judgment of the court, said at  paragraph
             42: 'In  our  view,  that  is  not  to  say  that  a  test  of
             exceptionality is  being  applied.   Rather  it  is  that,  in
             approaching the question of whether removal is a proportionate
             interference with an individual's article 8 rights, the scales
             are heavily weighted in favour of  deportation  and  something
             very compelling (which will be "exceptional") is  required  to
             outweigh the public interest in removal'.

         50.  Delay is not determinative and is merely  a  relevant  factor:
             Strbac v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 848.  In S, H & Q v SSHD  [2009]
             EWCA Civ 142 the court found that  arguments  of  'unfairness'
             based on administrative delay simpliciter do not give rise  to
             any jurisdiction in the court to intervene.  The Secretary  of
             State dealt with the Appellant's initial asylum claim in  2007
             highly expeditiously.  That initial asylum claim  having  been
             refused he  had  no  justification  in  regarding  himself  as
             settled in the UK.  Whilst his mother was  ultimately  granted
             DL, that was not put in place until February 2016 (despite the
             fact that on 26 January 2016 the Secretary of State had sent a
             Further Submissions Decision letter to Mrs [C]  in  which  she
             concluded that she did not qualify for leave  on  any  basis).
             There is some merit in the argument that the Respondent showed
             acquiescence in the Appellant's remaining in the  UK  when  he
             was  given  permission  to  work  in  2015.    However,   this
             permission was limited  to  shortage  occupations.   UT  Judge
             Kekic refers to 'the absence of any enforcement action against
             the applicant when he was seen by an  immigration  officer  in
             2009".  However, in his skeleton argument Counsel  notes  that
             the Secretary of State  "has  disclosed  no  evidence  of  the
             same", and in her most recent witness statement Mrs  [C]  says
             that she is 'unable to remember the incident' [WS �3].  Mr [C]
             has not suffered any specific detriment in consequence of  the
             delay in making a decision on his mother's  application  (even
             assuming that he believed himself to be a  dependant  on  that
             application).  Whilst he entered into  a  relationship  during
             this period (with DT), that was in full knowledge of the  fact
             that  his   immigration   position   was   precarious.    That
             relationship has been over for some time,  and  the  Appellant
             has no especially strong links of the kind that  would  create
             relationships that are hard to disrupt (such as  that  between
             parent and minor child or husband and wife).

         51.  In Agyarko [2017]  UKSC  10  Lord  Reed  emphasised  that  the
             critical issue will generally be whether, giving due weight to
             the strength of the public interest  in  the  removal  of  the
             person  in  the  case  before  it,  the  Article  8  claim  is
             sufficiently strong to outweigh it [�57].  Taking  account  of
             all relevant considerations and weighing in  the  balance  the
             public interest considerations, it has  not  been  shown  that
             there are in this case any 'very compelling reasons' [per SSHD
             v SS (Congo) &  Ors  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387]  outweighing  the
             legitimate aim of  maintaining  economic  well-being  and  the
             rights  of  others  by  applying  a   consistent   immigration
             control."

4.   There was an application for  permission  to  appeal.   Permission  was
    refused by the First-tier Tribunal, however permission was  granted  by
    the Upper Tribunal on 7 May 2019.  The respondent filed a  response  on
    22 May 2019 concurring with the analysis of the API referred to by  the
    judge and arguing that she had  properly  addressed  all  issues  under
    Article 8.  Counsel relied on his skeleton argument dated 3  June  2019
    and on the submissions in the grounds of appeal on the two issues.  The
    API systematically dealt with different groups of  dependants  and  the
    First-tier Judge's analysis could not be  correct  because  the  second
    paragraph dealt with exactly the same cohort  as  the  first  paragraph
    with the same consequences and on the judge's interpretation the second
    paragraph would be wholly otiose.  In relation to delay the  First-tier
    Judge had not taken  full  account  of  the  effect  of  delay  on  the
    proportionality exercise and had dealt with  the  issue  in  an  overly
    dismissive manner when stating  "delay  is  not  determinative  and  is
    merely a relevant factor".  Reference was made to paragraph 52  of  the
    decision in Agyarko.

5.   At the hearing Counsel submitted that if there  was  any  ambiguity  it
    should be resolved in favour of the appellant.  The letter granting the
    appellant permission to work predated the grant of discretionary  leave
    to his mother.  That seemed to indicate that the appellant was  treated
    as a  dependant  of  his  mother's  submissions.   Both  the  grant  of
    discretionary leave to the appellant's mother on 8  February  2016  and
    the further submissions letter in relation to  the  appellant's  mother
    dated 26 January 2016 predated the "further submissions" policy version
    9.0 published on 19 February 2016 and lodged by Mr  Whitwell.   It  was
    not possible retrospectively  to  interpret  a  previous  policy.   The
    appellant had been granted permission to work on 25 August  2015  while
    his further asylum related representations were being  considered.   In
    relation to the delay issue Counsel relied on  his  skeleton  argument.
    Although the grant of permission to work might mean that the  appellant
    was economically dependent the issue was whether he  was  dependent  on
    his mother's claim.

6.   Mr Whitwell relied on the respondent's response.  He pointed  out  that
    there were many APIs many of which were interrelated.  He  referred  to
    the 19 February 2016 API  which  referred  to  dependency  included  in
    further submissions by coincidence also in the same  paragraph  as  the
    previous 2014 policy - paragraph 3.8.  That made the  position  crystal
    clear when it stated, "any dependant who is currently under 18 and  was
    included in the original asylum or human rights claim, should  continue
    to be  treated  as  a  dependant  until  any  further  submissions  are
    concluded".  Any lack of clarity could lead  to  inconsistent  decision
    making.  The judge had  concluded  correctly  albeit  via  a  different
    route.  The appellant had not been treated as a dependant of his mother
    and had been dealt with in his own right and they had never been joined
    in a joint application on the Home Office database.  It was clear  that
    the appellant had been over 18 when the further submissions were  made.
    The delay argument was made on the assumption that  the  appellant  was
    tied to the further submissions.   Any  delay  would  arise  after  the
    asylum claim lodged  on  18  April  2016  by  the  appellant  had  been
    certified in October 2016.  There had  been  no  delay.   The  mother's
    circumstances were different.  It was an erroneous assumption that  the
    appellant had been granted permission to work as  a  dependant  of  his
    mother.

7.   In response Counsel submitted that the policy relied on  in  this  case
    predated the 2016 policy and the policy relied on was contradictory  or
    ambiguous and should be construed in  favour  of  the  appellant.   The
    appellant had been entitled to rely on the policy.  Page 4  of  the  19
    February 2016 policy showed that there had been changes since the  last
    version.  The letter from the Home  Office  dated  25  August  2015  in
    relation to the appellant's employment suggested that the appellant was
    considered as part of the further submissions made.  In relation to the
    delay issue Counsel referred to EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41.  The  delay
    did not depend on whether  the  appellant  was  the  party  to  further
    submissions.  The judge had dealt with the issue of  suitability.   The
    issues in dispute had not been properly dealt with and it would  follow
    that it was disproportionate to refuse the appellant's claim  on  human
    rights grounds.

8.   At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I can  of
    course only interfere with the judge's decision if  it  was  materially
    flawed in law.

9.   In relation to  the  policy,  the  First-tier  Judge  was  in  my  view
    entitled to conclude as she did.  It is accepted by  Mr  Whitwell  that
    the policy could have been clearer but in  the  circumstances  of  this
    case it is apparent that the appellant's  mother  made  an  application
    with the appellant as her dependent when  he  was  under  18  and  this
    application was concluded on 22 May 2007 when the appeal was dismissed.
     By 28 August 2008 the appellant was no longer under 18.  When  writing
    to the appellant's mother as the judge notes no mention was made of the
    appellant's inclusion as a dependant on his mother's claim.  While  the
    policy could perhaps have been more clearly worded I am satisfied  that
    it the First-tier Judge came to  the  right  conclusion  in  this  case
    notwithstanding the points made by Counsel.  I  reach  this  conclusion
    independently of the later policy as did the First-tier Judge. I reject
    the claim that the policy  was  ambiguous  or  that  the  later  policy
    demonstrates that it was.

10.  I am not satisfied that the judge erred in  her  careful  consideration
    of the issue of delay in her decision at paragraphs 47ff set out above.
     She properly directed  herself  by  reference  to  Agyarko  and  other
    relevant authorities. She reminded herself in paragraph 50  that  delay
    was not determinative I do not find that her approach to the issue  was
    unduly narrow or dismissive. While the judge acknowledged some merit in
    the argument that the Secretary of State  showed  acquiescence  in  the
    appellant's remaining in the UK when he was given permission to work in
    2015 this permission was limited to shortage  occupations.   The  judge
    also notes  the  reference  by  Judge  Kekic  to  the  absence  of  any
    enforcement action against  the  applicant  when  he  was  seen  by  an
    Immigration Officer in 2009 but the judge  records  what  was  said  by
    Counsel in his skeleton argument and  the  fact  that  the  appellant's
    mother stated she was unable to  remember  the  incident  in  her  most
    recent witness statement. It appears the point had not been established
    on the evidence before her.  She  had  in  mind  all  relevant  matters
    including the appellant's relationship. She had in addition given  full
    attention to the appellant's circumstances when  considering  his  case
    under the rules.

    DECISION
