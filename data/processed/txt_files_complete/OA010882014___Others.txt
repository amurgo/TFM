For the appellants:    Mr J Chipperfield, instructed by A & P Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. These are the appellants' linked appeals against the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Morrison promulgated 2.9.14, dismissing their
    appeals against the decisions of the  respondent,  dated  11.12.13,  to
    refuse entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  as  dependent  relatives
    (wife, daughter and niece) of Mr Emmanuel  Kwabena  Mensah,  a  British
    citizen.  The Judge heard the appeal on 18.8.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge McWilliam granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    2.1.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 11.3.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Morrison should be set aside.

 5. In essence, the grounds  assert  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    conducted an inadequate article 8 ECHR assessment,  failing  to  follow
    the Razgar stepped approach. It is also  pointed  out  that  the  judge
    erred by repeatedly stating that he had to deal with article 8  on  the
    basis of the circumstances appertaining at the date of hearing.

 6. There is no merit in a further ground of appeal  which  complains  that
    the judge failed to take account of the public interest  considerations
    under section 117B of the 2002  Act.  Mr  Chipperfield  explained  this
    argument, drafted by another, as because the  sponsor  was  financially
    independent it was not in the public interest to remove  him.  That  is
    reading too much into  117B,  which  is  intended  to  set  out  public
    interest considerations  when  weighing  the  public  interest  against
    private and family life rights in an article 8 assessment. That  it  is
    in the public interest that persons seeking to enter or remain  in  the
    UK are financially independent. If the sponsor and thus the appellant's
    are financially independent it may be a factor to be considered in  the
    article 8 assessment but it is not necessary for this to be framed in a
    117B consideration. As the case of Dube (ss 117A -  117D)  [2015]  UKUT
    00090 (IAC) explained, these provisions do not represent  any  kind  of
    radical departure from or 'override' of previous case law on article  8
    so far as concerns the need for a structured  approach,  including  the
    Razgar steps.

 7. Judge Morrison found that the appellants failed to meet  the  specified
    evidence requirements of Appendix FM-SE in order  to  demonstrate  that
    the sponsor's income met the financial threshold required, although the
    judge was satisfied that the sponsor did have the income  claimed,  and
    met other requirements as to the relationship.

 8. As paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE explains, the specified  evidence  has
    to  be  submitted  with  the  application  and  unless  the  evidential
    flexibility provisions set out there apply, the Secretary of State will
    not accept later documents. As it  was,  even  at  the  appeal  hearing
    documents meeting the evidential requirements had not  been  submitted.
    It follows that the appeal had to fail under the Immigration Rules.

 9. That the judge was wrong to take the position as of the date of hearing
    rather than the date of decision is not material. Whether Beatrice, the
    second appellant, was an  adult  or  had  turned  18  at  the  date  of
    consideration, she was allegedly still part of the family and I can see
    no practical difference to any  article  8  family  life  consideration
    outside the Rules simply because she has turned 18. She did not in  any
    event meet paragraph 297 of the Rules  at  the  date  of  decision  and
    therefore there is no detrimental effect on any of  the  appellants  by
    the judge's error.

10. As far as the failure of the judge to conduct a more thorough,  Razgar-
    compliant, article 8  assessment  is  concerned,  Mr  Chipperfield  was
    unable to demonstrate that but for the error  the  appeals  could  have
    been allowed under article 8 outside the  Rules.  That  the  appellants
    didn't meet the requirements of the Rules is a highly  relevant  factor
    to be taken  into  account  in  an  article  8  asssessment,  but  more
    significant  is  that  on  the  appellants'  case  they  can  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules, if  only  they  had  submitted  the  correct
    documents at the correct stage. In the circumstances, it  is  difficult
    to understand  how  the  refusal  decision  could  ever  be  considered
    disproportionate; it remains open to the appellants  to  make  a  fresh
    application marshalling  all  their  documents.  Article  8  is  not  a
    shortcut to compliance with the Rules and there is no reason why  these
    appellants should be able to circumvent the Rules by relying on article
    8, which as Judge  Morrison  pointed  out  at  ï¿½31  is  not  a  general
    dispensing power, citing Lord Carnwarth in Patel & Others v SSHD [2013]
    UKSC 72.

11. In respect of this issue, Mr Chipperfield relied on the recent case  of
    Mostafa (Article  8  in  entry  clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  00112  (IAC).
    However, the present circumstances are very  different  to  that  case,
    where there was no right of appeal against the paragraph 41 visit  visa
    refusal, other than on discrimination and  human  rights  grounds.  The
    Tribunal panel held that whilst the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  been
    wrong to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules,  as  he  had  no
    jurisdiction to do so, the fact that the appellant met the requirements
    of the Rules was capable of being a weighty, though not  determinative,
    factor when deciding whether  such  refusal  is  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control. Whilst in the  present
    appeal the First-tier Tribunal Judge was satisfied that the sponsor met
    the income threshold, the appellants had not in fact met the evidential
    requirements of the Rules. Further, there  is  a  remedy  open  to  the
    appellants which was not open to the appellant in Mostafa,  to  make  a
    fresh application, which if properly made with correct evidence,  would
    meet the requirements of the Rules and in  respect  of  which  even  if
    refused, they have a right of appeal. It was not the fault of the Entry
    Clearance Officer that the appellants failed to marshal  the  necessary
    evidence to demonstrate that the sponsor's income met the Rules.

12. In the circumstances of this case, I cannot  see  that  there  was  any
    prospect whatsoever of the appellants succeeding on article  8  grounds
    on the basis that the decision was  disproportionate  to  their  family
    life rights in the proportionality balancing exercise  between  on  the
    one hand their rights and on the other  the  legitimate  and  necessary
    public interest in protecting the economic well-being of the UK through
    Immigration control.

Conclusions:

13. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be  set  aside.  There  were
    errors of law, but on the facts of this case they are not  material  as
    they did not affect the outcome of the appeal.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeals remain dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: the appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
