Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Mascord, Lawrence Lupin Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan date of birth 1st  January
       1993. He has permission[1] to appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fisher)[2] to dismiss his  appeal  against
       the Respondent's decision to refuse him leave  to  enter  the  United
       Kingdom[3].


    2. The appeal was dismissed because the First-tier Tribunal did not have
       before it  any  reasons  why  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  was
       challenged.  Judge Fisher notes that the Notice of Appeal form lodged
       on the 16th October 2014 refers to "attached grounds' but no  grounds
       were attached to it.  On the 20th October 2014 the Tribunal  directed
       the Appellant's representatives to  lodge  specific  grounds  with  a
       warning that failure to do  so  would  result  in  the  matter  being
       dismissed  without  a  hearing  under  the  provisions  of  the  2005
       Procedure Rules.


    3. The matter came before Judge Fisher on the 11th November 2014 and  on
       that date no reasoned  grounds  were  in  the  file.  He  accordingly
       dismissed the appeal.


    4. The grounds of appeal are that in fact grounds of appeal specific  to
       the Appellant were lodged twice; first on the 16th  October  2014  by
       way of fax and then on the 22nd October 2014 by post. In  respect  of
       the first set, Lawrence Lupin Solicitors use software called Faxmaker
       which records not only the transmission time and record of  delivery,
       but the content of the material sent. That has been produced  by  PDF
       attachment.  The successfully sent fax consisted of 29 pages, page 28
       of which is the grounds of appeal that specifically  relate  to  this
       Appellant.  The grounds were then sent by post on  the  22nd  October
       2014, and the Appellant  now  produces  a  'recorded  delivery  slip'
       showing that they were received at the Tribunal on the  27th  October
       2014 at 8.03am.


    5. I find that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  its  finding  that  no
       reasoned grounds of appeal had been lodged. I make  no  criticism  of
       Judge Fisher, since it would appear by administrative error that  the
       grounds were not linked with the file.


    6. In the circumstances I direct that the  matter  be  remitted  to  the
       First-tier Tribunal where the Appellant can have  his  asylum  appeal
       listed, heard and determined following an oral hearing.


       Decisions

    7. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law
       and it is set aside.


    8. The appeal is to be re-made in the First-tier Tribunal.
