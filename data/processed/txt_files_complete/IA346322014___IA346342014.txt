Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Lay of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The first appellant made an application on 20th June 2014 for leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points Based System
    and the second appellant made an application as his  dependent  further
    to Paragraph 319C of the Immigration Rules.

 2.  On  18th  August  2014  the  respondent  refused  to  vary  the  first
    appellant's leave under Paragraph 245BB (d) and  refused  to  vary  the
    second appellant's leave under Paragraph 319C. The respondent also made
    decisions  to  remove  them.  Under  Paragraph  245DD  (b),  the  first
    appellant must comply  with  Paragraph  41(c)  of  Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  In line with that requirement  an  applicant  would
    only be considered to have access to funds where

         '...  the  money  is  either  held  in  a  UK  regulated  financial
         institution or is transferable to the United Kingdom'

 3. The funds upon which the appellant was said to be reliant were held  in
    the Mutual Trust Bank in Bangladesh and the evidence he  had  submitted
    did not confirm that the funds in that institution were transferable to
    the United Kingdom. It was not considered that he had access  to  funds
    as per Paragraph 41 of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

 4. Further he claimed to have an investment of �8,485  from  the  cost  of
    sales and had provided a letter from  Green  Associates  and  unaudited
    accounts dated 16th June 2014 but the reason for refusal letter  stated
    that this was 'not acceptable evidence of  investment  as  it  is  from
    sales and stock purchases'.

 5. Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal Quinn refused the  appellant's  appeal
    on 23rd January 2015 in the following terms;

         '14.     I found that the letter from  Mutual  Trust  Bank  Limited
         dated June 19th 2014 was written specifically  for  the  UK  Border
         Agency but that letter failed to indicate that the  funds  held  in
         Bangladesh were transferrable to the  United  Kingdom.   Whilst  Mr
         Khan, who wrote the letter, might not be  aware  that  this  was  a
         requirement, I was  satisfied  that  the  appellant  knew  of  this
         requirement and he had not obtained a letter  confirming  that  his
         funds in Bangladesh could be transferred to the United Kingdom  and
         this was fatal to his claim.  He was in my  view  correctly  scored
         nit points under Appendix A.

         15.      Pargraph 41C  of  Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration  Rules
         required an applicant to have access to funds where 'the  money  is
         either  held  in  a  UK  regulated  financial  institution  or   is
         transferrable to the UK".  Neither of these conditions was met.

         16.      Similarly no points were appropriate for money held  in  a
         regulated financial institution as the money was not so held'

         17.      If the money was transferrable to the  United  Kingdom  it
         begged the question of why some, or all, of the money had not  been
         transferred.

         18.      With regard to investment a balance sheet dated 16th  June
         2014 for Mars 3 International Limited showed that sales  of  �8,485
         had generated a loss for the period of  �9,023.   The  company  was
         therefore trading at a loss.

         19.      I had some trouble understanding  the  accounts  as  there
         were creditors shown of �12,662 which would suggest that some sales
         had taken place.  However the letter dated 29th December 2014  read
         'no sale was made at this period and directors invest (sic)  �8,485
         for purchasing goods'.  The accounts were  unaudited  and  did  not
         provide acceptable evidence of investment'.

 6. The appellant made an application for permission to appeal on the basis
    that it was clear from the wording of the letter that  the  funds  were
    transferrable to the UK.  It was clear  from  the  letter  from  Mutual
    Trust Bank dated 19th June 2014 which was put before the  Secretary  of
    State as it was in the Home Office bundle that the letter did refer  to
    funds being transferable on the request of the appellant. It  could  be
    inferred from the wording of the paragraph as a whole that it  was  for
    an investor visa in the UK and that the funds were transferable to  the
    UK for that purpose and the judge failed in  taking  into  account  the
    wording of the letter.  Alternatively the judge did  not  give  reasons
    for finding that the letter  did  not  say  that  the  funds  were  not
    transferable. Further the judge erred in stating that even at the  date
    of hearing there was no letter from the bank in  Bangladesh  confirming
    that the funds could be transferable to the United Kingdom.

 7. Secondly the appellant claimed that he had already in the  business  to
    make up the shortfall of �50,000 and already invested  over  �8,000  in
    the company and he had submitted unaudited accounts to support this and
    a letter from Green Associate Accountants page E  of  the  respondent's
    bundle. He provided company bank  statements  with  payments  from  his
    personal account going into the company account as investment.

 8. The judge only addressed this at paragraph [19] and stated that he  did
    not understand the accounts.

 9. However the judge failed to address (i) whether the claimed figure  was
    in fact costs of sales as alleged by the respondent where there was  no
    evidence of any sales.  (ii)Although stock purchases had been  made  by
    the company where this money had come from  (iii)  the  fact  that  the
    company bank statements in the bundle demonstrated the investments made
    by the appellant in the form of money paid in by him (which was in turn
    spent on the stock purchases).

10. Paragraph 45 of Appendix A set out when points should  be  awarded  for
    money invested under the Immigration Rules.

11. It was an error to reject unaudited accounts as evidence when Paragraph
    46-SD(a)(ii) of Appendix A states clearly that where a company  is  not
    required to produce audited, unaudited accounts can be used.

12. There were additional funds of �1,500 in a UK Lloyds Bank account which
    were available in cash and accessible to be invested  in  the  company.
    These were not considered.

13. Thirdly the judge failed to consider the  Article  8  claim  under  the
    Immigration Rules in particular under Paragraph  276ADE.  Although  the
    judge  accepted  that  there  was  a  private  life  he  undertook   no
    proportionality  balancing  exercise  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.
    There was not even a reference to  their  continuous  lawful  residence
    which now exceeded 5 years.

14. That application for permission to appeal was refused by Judge  Pirotta
    but renewed to the Upper  Tribunal  and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kebede
    considered that there was an arguable error  of  law.   She  considered
    that the Article 8 ground had no merit in isolation.

15. At the hearing before me it was submitted by Mr Lay  who  produced  the
    case of Durrani (Entrepreneurs : bank letter :  evidential  flexibility
    [2014] UKUT 295 (IAC) that the question  of  transferability  had  been
    addressed by the letter dated 19th June 2014. This was in  relation  to
    the �45,000.

16. In relation to the further �8,000 if that sum in  the accounts  related
    to sales it was not of assistance but if it related to stock  purchases
    this was acceptable for the purposes of investment.  The  Secretary  of
    State was confused as to whether stock purchases could  count  and  the
    letter from Green Associates made that clear.  The  letter  dated  29th
    December 2014 showed that there had been  purchase.   This  letter  was
    evidence which was produced  after  the  decision  of  the  respondent.
    Indeed there was a letter in which Green Associates stated

         'We  write  to  confirm  that  we  act  as  accountants  for  Mars3
         International Limited Company Registration No  08823615  registered
         in England and Wales. Based  on  the  information  and  explanation
         provided by the management, we have prepared unaudited  report  and
         accounts for the period from 2nd May 2014 to 16th June 2014.

         The company's purchases in this period were �8,485.   No  sale  was
         made at this period and  directors  invest  �8,485  for  purchasing
         goods.  However the stock position was confirmed by client and  not
         considered by us as  the  accounts  were  prepared  for  management
         purpose only.  The net realisable value of goods at  the  year  end
         should be accounted as stocks in the  balance  sheet  of  statutory
         accounts.

         In accordance with our usual practice this letter is given in  good
         faith without any liabilities on the  part  of  this  firm  or  its
         writer'

17. Mr Lay also submitted that there were also bank statements that  showed
    that there were payments going into the company account which were used
    to purchase stock.  The First-Tier Tribunal  incorrectly  rejected  the
    evidence on the basis that the accounts were not audited but  this  was
    not necessary.  The judge appeared to consider that  the  entries  were
    generated by sales but this was incorrect.   The  Lloyds  Bank  account
    showed cash deposits from the appellant.

18. Ms Isherwood submitted that the appellant had changed his  evidence  at
    the First-tier Tribunal appeal.   At  Section  E  of  the  respondent's
    bundle there was a reference to cost of sales equalling  �8,485.   That
    was the evidence before the Secretary of State and this was referred to
    at Paragraph 19 of the decision.  The judge was entitled  to  take  the
    view he did. With reference  to  transferability  the  letter  did  not
    comply with the strict wording of the Immigration Rules  and  this  was
    referred to at paragraph 14 and the wording was  precise.  The  wording
    did not conform.

19. Mr Lay submitted that as long as the funds were transferable to the  UK
    that was acceptable and it was an issue of terminology.

20. Section E of the bundle with reference to the  �8,485  should  be  read
    alongside the balance sheet and at  this  point  Mr  Lay  attempted  to
    reopen the issue with respect  to  Article  8  to  which  Ms  Isherwood
    objected.

Conclusions

21. The requirements for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant
    are set out under Paragraph 245DD(b) and state that the appellant  must
    have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs 35 to 53  of  Appendix  A.
    Under Table 4 of Appendix A the applicant must have access to not  less
    than �50,000 and he was previously Tier 1 (Post Study Work Migrant).

22. Nonetheless Paragraph 41states

         'An applicant will only be considered to have access  to  funds  if
         ...

             ...

             (iii)     The money is either held in a UK regulated financial
             institution or is transferable to the UK; and..

23. The rules specifically state that the money must be transferable to the
    United Kingdom.  The letter from the Mutual Trust  Bank  Ltd  does  not
    state this.   It  refers  to  funds  held  jointly  between  Mr  Manash
    Chowdhury and Mr Ripan Kumar Rudra and notes that they  are  making  an
    application to the UK Border Agency for further leave to remain in  the
    United Kingdom and the letter states 'In this regards, we  can  confirm
    that fund stated above in their account  is  genuine  and  we  have  no
    objection to transfer the fund according to their  instruction'.   Even
    though the bank might transfer the funds  at  the  instruction  of  the
    appellant there was no confirmation from the bank that the funds  could
    indeed be transferred out of Bangladesh  to  the  United  Kingdom.  The
    rules make clear that the money must  be  transferable  to  the  United
    Kingdom.  It cannot be assumed even if the funds can be transferred  at
    the  behest  of  the  account  holder  that  they  can  necessarily  be
    transferred out a country and further to the United Kingdom.

24. I am not persuaded that Durrani  assists  the  appellant.   Rather  the
    conclusion in Durrani was that 'there is no substance in  the  argument
    that the  relevant  requirements  contained  in  paragraph  41-SD(a)(i)
    produce an absurd result and must, therefore, be  interpreted  in  some
    other manner'.  Durrani referred to banks in  the  United  Kingdom  but
    nonetheless the requirement regarding transfer of funds to the  UK,  in
    this instance, is absolutely specific and could be  complied  with;  it
    was not as the judge found.

25. I turn to the question of the stock.  It is  clear  from  Paragraph  45
    that if the applicant has invested the money referred to in Table 4  in
    the UK before the date of the application, points will be  awarded  for
    funds available as if the applicant  had  not  yet  invest  the  funds,
    providing

         45 (a)   the investment was made no more than 12 months ...  before
         the date of the application and

             (b) all of the specified documents required in paragraph 46-SD
             (a) to (g) are provided to show

                  (i)  the amount of money invested: and

                  (ii) that the applicant has established a business in  the
                  UK in which the money was invested

26. The appellant claimed to have invested money in his company.  It would,
    however, appear that the appellant has amended  his  interpretation  of
    the accounts since the application was made.  Indeed at  Section  E  of
    the respondent's bundle is the letter from Green Associates dated  19th
    June 2014.  In this the �8,485 is  clearly  referred  to  as  'cost  of
    sales'. There is no reference to purchase of stocks.  This is  afforded
    as a later explanation and post decision. Indeed as  the  judge  points
    out, in the profit and loss account for the period 2nd May 2014 to 16th
    June 2014 the sales of �8,485 are recorded as a  'gross  loss'.  Indeed
    the overall loss of �9,023 is made up of the administrative expenses of
    �538 and the 'cost of sales' of �8,485.  That  figure  is  referred  to
    twice in the accounts as cost of  sales  and  once  as  purchases.  The
    explanatory letter of 19th June 2014 refers to  the  figures  as  being
    sales.   It is not  surprising  that  the  judge  stated  that  he  had
    difficulty in understanding the accounts and the  appellant  must  bear
    the responsibility of producing clear accounts. This  is  the  evidence
    that was placed before the Secretary  of  State  when  considering  the
    application.  I find that a figure which is clearly described  as  cost
    of sales (and then shown as a loss) cannot then be transfigured into an
    'asset'.

27. The judge at [18] clearly picked up on the point that the  company  was
    trading at a  loss  and  did  not  accept  that  the  �8,485  could  be
    interpreted as an investment.  His comments at  [19]  merely  reflected
    the confused state of the accounts and description as  sales  and  then
    purchases. As I say, the onus is on the appellant to  produce  a  clear
    explanation of his accounts.   The judge referred to the letter of 29th
    December 2014 from  Green  Associates  which  attempted  a  post  dated
    explanation of the accounts and terminology and  further  attempted  to
    reflect the figure as a purchase of stock.  This  evidence  post  dates
    the application and could not be taken into account. Ahmed and  Another
    (PBS:  admissible  evidence)  [2014]  UKUT  00365  (IAC)  confirms  the
    prohibition on new evidence  in  Section  85A(4)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  applies  to  the  non-points-scoring
    aspect of the Rule such that where a points-based application  is  made
    and refused the assessment by the judge is to be of a material that was
    before the decision maker  rather  than  a  new  consideration  of  the
    material.

28. There was criticism that the bank accounts, showing the  appellant  had
    transferred money to the business and had made  stock  purchases,  were
    not considered by the judge and that he was wrong  to  reject  evidence
    from unaudited accounts, but I am  not  persuaded  that  the  appellant
    could in any event comply with the requirements of Paragraph  46-SD(b).
    Further to Paragraph 46-SD (b)

         'Audited or unaudited accounts must show the  investment  in  money
         made directly by the applicant, in his own name or  on  his  behalf
         (and showing his name)'.

    The amount said to  be  invested  by  the  appellant  himself  was  not
    specific and it was not clear from the bank accounts to  what  use  the
    money was being put in the  business.   Jointly  with  his  partner  Mr
    Manash Chowdhury he was said to have invested �11,792 but that sum  did
    not equate with the sales and  administrative  expenses  shown  in  the
    accounts.  It was not clear what the appellant  himself  had  invested.
    As indicated it is the accounts that must show the investment  and  the
    appellant's investment in his own name or on his behalf.  The  accounts
    must show how much the appellant has invested in  the  business.   They
    did not.

29. The judge made no material error of law in respect of his  analysis  of
    the financial requirements.   Nor  was  there  an  error  with  regards
    Article 8 and indeed the permission was made noting that there  was  no
    merit for this ground in isolation.

Conclusion

30. I find that the judge made no material error of law  and  the  decision
    shall stand.
