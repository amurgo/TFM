JD


Mr. A Sheikh, a Senior Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,  appeared  on
behalf of the Appellant .  Mr.  N.  M.  Shoffa,  a  Solicitor's  Clerk,
appeared on behalf of the Respondent.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home  Department.
      The Respondent is a citizen of Iraq  from  Mosul,  in  what  was,
      until  comparatively  recently  the  Saddam  Hussein   government
      controlled area of Iraq.


   2. The Appellant appeals against the decision of an Adjudicator, Mr.
      D. N. Mallinson who in a determination promulgated on 13 February
      2003, following a hearing  at  Birmingham  on  27  January  2003,
      allowed the appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  the
      Appellant, taken on 17 July 2001  to  direct  his  removal  after
      refusing asylum.



   3. The Respondent claimed to have  arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom
      clandestinely on 18 February 2000 and applied for asylum  on  the
      same day. The Respondent's removal directions were to  Iraq,  but
      it is clear from the Adjudicator's determination  (see  paragraph
      39) that an undertaking was given on behalf of the Appellant that
      the Respondent would only be returned to the  Kurdish  autonomous
      area of Iraq and  not  to  a  part  of  Iraq  controlled  by  the
      government of Saddam Hussein. The Adjudicator allowed the  appeal
      on the basis that the Respondent was from Mosul,  in  the  Saddam
      Hussein government-controlled area of Iraq  and  according  to  a
      Home Office Operational Guidance Note which was before him (dated
      October 2002), the authorities in the Kurdish autonomous area had
      made it clear that they would only readmit to the territory  they
      control those who could show that they were  previously  resident
      there. The Operational Guidance Note said, 'internal  flight  for
      other Iraqis to the KAA is not therefore a  viable  option'.  The
      Adjudicator rejected most of the Respondent's account,  and  gave
      reasons  why  he  did  not  believe  there  to  be  a  reasonable
      likelihood that he had been arrested, detained and imprisoned  as
      he had claimed. However,  the  Adjudicator  believed  that  as  a
      failed asylum  seeker,  this  Respondent  would  be  at  risk  of
      persecution on return to the Saddam Hussein  controlled  area  of
      the country. In the light of the Home Office operational guidance
      note, Mr. Mallinson concluded that the Respondent  could  not  be
      returned to the Kurdish autonomous area because he would  not  be
      readmitted there.


   4. The grounds of appeal assert that the Adjudicator concluded  that
      it would be unduly harsh or unreasonable to expect the Respondent
      to relocate to the Kurdish  autonomous  area.  It  refers  to  an
      Operational Guidance note of February 2003 which, it is said,  no
      longer includes the advice the Adjudicator drew from the previous
      operational guidance note. A Country Information Policy Unit  run
      bulletin of February  2003  relates  a  different  situation  and
      paragraph 6.6 of that bulletin shows that Kurds do sometimes move
      voluntarily  from  the  central  part  of  Iraq  to  the  Kurdish
      autonomous area.

   5. The Tribunal drew Mr. Sheikh's  attention  to  the  judgement  of
      Schiemann LJ in Oleed v the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2003] INLR 189, where he said:-

        'Mr. Wilkin submitted, as I understood him, that  even  if  we
        were to allow  the  appeal  and  quash  the  decision  of  the
        Tribunal, the effect of that would be  to  revive  the  appeal
        before the Tribunal.  He  submitted  that  the  situation  was
        changing in Sri Lanka and that it  would  be  useful  for  the
        Tribunal to consider the position in the light of the  present
        day position.

        'It might well be useful but I do not consider that  it  would
        be a proper use of this Court's powers now to  send  the  case
        back to the Tribunal. The powers of this court are set out  in
        Civil Procedure Rules 1998, R52.10. We have all the powers  of
        the lower court. We may set aside or vary any  order  made  by
        the lower court. Those provisions give us the power  to  allow
        the appeal from the Tribunal,  set  aside  its  determination,
        substitute a determination  dismissing  the  appeal  from  the
        Adjudicator and thus restore his  determination.  The  present
        is, in my judgement, an appropriate case in which to  exercise
        that power. I accept that the Tribunal examines the  situation
        in the country from which the refugee is  fleeing  as  at  the
        date of its determination. However, in the present case in  my
        judgement  there  is  nothing  wrong  with  the  Adjudicator's
        determination, there was therefore, no reason  to  appeal  it,
        and it would be wrong for the Home Secretary, on the  back  of
        an appeal which has been dismissed, to seek to re-examine  the
        threat to the refugee with reference to a date later than  the
        Adjudicator's  determination.  To  permit  this  would  merely
        encourage appeals by a party who has no ground for appeal  but
        hopes that the situation would change sufficiently  to  enable
        him to advance  different  arguments  on  different  facts  on
        appeal. Such procedures would not be in anyone's interests'.

   6. Mr Sheikh submitted that the Adjudicator was wrong to decide that
      it would be unduly harsh to find that the  Respondent  could  not
      relocate. On the basis of the decision of the Court of Appeal  in
      Ravichandran [1996] Imm AR 97, there would  be  no  risk  to  the
      Appellant today.


   7. We indicated to Mr. Shoffa that we did not need to hear from  him
      and reserved our determination.

   8. We have decided that we must dismiss this appeal. Mr  Sheikh,  to
      be fair to him, displayed no great enthusiasm for  his  argument,
      which, we believe was flawed. It is of  course  the  duty  of  an
      Adjudicator when deciding an asylum appeal to assess the risk  of
      persecution facing an Appellant as at the date  of  the  hearing.
      However, this Adjudicator did  not  consider  that  it  would  be
      unduly harsh for this Respondent to relocate. What he did, was to
      quite properly look at the objective evidence and  conclude  that
      since this Respondent had never lived in the  Kurdish  autonomous
      area, on the basis of the evidence before him taken from the Home
      Office Operational Guidance Note, it was clear that there was  no
      internal flight option available to the Respondent in the Kurdish
      autonomous area because the authorities there would not admit him
      unless he could show that he had previously  lived  there.  There
      was no evidence before this Adjudicator that the  Respondent  had
      previously lived in the Kurdish autonomous area.

   9. We accept that evidence which came to light within what can  only
      have been a matter of weeks, disclosed that the situation was not
      as it had been described in  the  Operational  Guidance  Note  of
      October 2002, but there was no  available  evidence  before  this
      Adjudicator to indicate that the situation had changed,  and  the
      only evidence before Mr. Mallinson was that this Respondent would
      not be permitted  to  enter  the  Kurdish  autonomous  area.  The
      Appellant's own Operational Guidance Note reported that "internal
      flight...is not therefore a viable option".

   10. We believe that the Tribunal would be wrong  to  interfere  with
       the Adjudicator's findings since they were not plainly wrong  or
       unsustainable or perverse.  On  the  evidence  before  him,  the
       Adjudicator was entitled to reach the  conclusion  he  did.  The
       situation in Iraq has, of course, changed dramatically since  27
       January last when this appeal was heard by  Mr.  Mallinson,  but
       that, of itself, does not entitle the Tribunal to interfere with
       his decision.


  11. For all these reasons we dismiss this appeal.
