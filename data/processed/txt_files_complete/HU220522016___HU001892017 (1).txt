Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms B Asanovic, counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the appellants against a decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal promulgated on 30 November 2017 dismissing  their  appeal
    against the respondent's decision of 8  September  2016  refusing  them
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

Background


2.    The appellants are citizens of Nigeria born on 28 March  1980  and  24
    April  1987  respectively.   The  first  appellant  was  granted  entry
    clearance as a student on 1 August 2006 and his leave was  subsequently
    extended until 31 October 2010.   He  was  granted  further  post-study
    leave under Tier 1, initially until 29 October 2012 and then  until  18
    March 2016.  On 22 February 2016 he sought indefinite leave  to  remain
    under Tier 1 but his  application  was  refused  and  was  subsequently
    treated as withdrawn when he sought indefinite leave to remain  on  the
    grounds of long residence on 16 March 2016.

3.    The second appellant entered the UK  on  10  May  2010  as  the  first
    appellant's partner and has been granted leave in line with  his  until
    18 March 2016.  They have four children who have been born and  brought
    up in the UK.  They were all under  seven  at  the  date  of  both  the
    respondent's decision and the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.


4.    The application for  leave  on  the  grounds  of  long  residence  was
    refused on the basis that the  first  appellant  had  used  deceit  and
    dishonesty in misleading government departments about his earnings and,
    in these circumstances, he fell within the provisions  of  para  322(2)
    and para 322(5) of HC 395 as someone who had made false representations
    for the purpose of obtaining leave to remain and, accordingly,  it  was
    undesirable that he should be allowed to remain in the UK.

5.    These findings were based on the apparent contradictions  between  the
    information submitted in  support  of  two  previous  applications  for
    further leave to remain by the first appellant and his tax  returns  to
    HM Customs and Revenue (HMRC). In his application of 1  April  2011  to
    the respondent the first appellant claimed  that  he  had  earnings  of
    �55,981 including earnings with Royal Mail of  �16,514.59  and  profits
    from his business of �39,166.92, whereas he declared in his tax  return
    to HMRC that his business had a turnover of �42,357  and  a  profit  of
    �11,649 and in his application to the respondent of 18  March  2013  he
    said that he had earnings of �55,041.63, earnings from  Royal  Mail  of
    �23,756.44 and business profits  of  �31,285.19,  but  his  tax  return
    showed a turnover of �31,355 with a profit of �4,536.   The  respondent
    was satisfied in the light of these figures that  the  first  appellant
    had made false declarations in his two previous applications  and  that
    it would  be  against  the  public  interest  for  him  to  be  granted
    indefinite leave on the grounds of his character and conduct.


The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

6.    At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal it was argued on  behalf
    of the appellants that the first appellant had not  acted  dishonestly,
    there were credible explanations for the figures he  had  submitted  to
    HMRC and his tax returns had been corrected  before  he  had  made  the
    current  application.   It  was  further  argued  that  there   was   a
    combination of factors  which  had  led  to  inaccurate  figures  being
    submitted: a large amount of expenditure not taken  into  account  when
    assessing his profits and in particular he had been entitled to  offset
    against his profits the costs of his Master's degree.


7.    In addition to the evidence from  the  first  and  second  appellants,
    there was  a  substantial  bundle  of  documentary  evidence  including
    reports from Kilby Fox, accountants.  Having considered  the  evidence,
    the judge found  at  [32]  that  the  respondent  had  shown  that  the
    appellants had made false representations and had  failed  to  disclose
    relevant material for the purpose of obtaining leave to remain  in  the
    UK and the appeal was dismissed.


The Grounds of Appeal

8.    In the grounds of appeal, it is argued in ground 1  at  para  19  that
    the judge's decision was tainted by errors of fact amounting to  errors
    of law.  These are particularised in para 20 (1)-(12) and it is  argued
    that the errors of fact  are  such  that  they  undermine  the  judge's
    assessment of the evidence.  Ground 2 argues that the judge  failed  to
    set out the appellants' case, the submissions made on their  behalf  or
    the skeleton argument and this gave an appearance of unfairness in that
    their case was not properly considered and, in any event, it was unfair
    to go behind the figures of earnings for either of the two  periods  in
    issue as this had not been asserted in the reasons for refusal  letter.
    Ground 3 argues that the judge failed to apply the burden and  standard
    of proof in relation to cases of deception.


9.    Permission to appeal was granted by the Upper Tribunal  on  the  basis
    that the judge's assessment of the general grounds of refusal  arguably
    treated the burden as  resting  on  the  appellants  and  it  was  also
    arguable that the judge  had  relied  on  the  absence  of  documentary
    evidence and had erred by so doing.


10.   In her submissions, Ms Asanovic referred to  her  statement  of  truth
    dated 13 December 2017 and, in particular, to  the  fact  that  at  the
    hearing the first appellant had been examined in detail in relation  to
    the documents in appendix 6 of the Kilby Fox report  and  at  [25]  the
    judge had said that appendix 7 did not appear in the bundle before  her
    whereas it did.  She adopted her grounds and in particular  the  errors
    of fact identified in para 20 of the grounds.


11.   Mr Kandola accepted that if these  errors  had  been  made,  then  the
    judge would have erred in law by failing to take relevant matters  into
    account  and  by  basing  her  findings,  at  least  in  part,   on   a
    misapprehension of the evidence before her but it was  not  clear  from
    his papers precisely what had been in front of her at the hearing.


The Error of Law

12.   I am satisfied that ground 1 is made out and that the  judge  did  err
    in law such that the decision should be set aside.  By way of  example,
    the judge erred factually at [25] by saying  that  appendix  7  of  the
    Kilby Fox report referred to did not appear in the  bundle  whereas  it
    did at A-F 131-135.  Similarly, the judge said also in  [25]  that  she
    had not  seen  invoices  from  suppliers  in  respect  of  the  claimed
    expenses, when these invoices had been the subject of cross-examination
    and  had  been  produced.   Further,  the  judge  said  at  [31]   that
    unfortunately appendix 6 had not been produced, whereas it had  at  A-F
    79-130.  At [36] in  relation  to  a  revised  tax  return,  the  judge
    commented that the document had been omitted whereas it was in appendix
    11 starting at A-F 153.

13.   It may be that some of these errors occurred  because  the  bundle  of
    documents had initially not been correctly or sufficiently indexed  but
    Ms Asanovic explained that this issue had been raised with the judge at
    the beginning of the hearing and an amended index had been supplied and
    the  respondent  was  given  additional   time   to   cross-check   the
    documentation.


14.   In  any  event,  for  whatever  reason,  documents  were  produced  in
    evidence capable of affecting the  judge's  decision,  which  were  not
    taken into account, and the judge  drew  adverse  inferences  from  the
    failure to produce relevant documents which had in fact been  produced.
    Ground 1 is made out  and  requires  the  decision  to  be  set  aside.
    Without ground 1, grounds 2 and 3 would  have  little  substance.  Both
    parties submitted that the proper course  was  for  the  appeal  to  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for reconsideration  by  way  of  a
    full rehearing.   Taking  into  account  the  guidance  in  the  Senior
    President's Practice Statement, I agree that this is the right course.


Decision

15.   The First-tier Tribunal erred in law such that the  decision  must  be
    set aside.  The appeal is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
    reconsideration by way of a full rehearing by a different judge.
