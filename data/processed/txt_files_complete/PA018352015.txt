Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Pedro promulgated  on  24  January  2017  in  which  he  dismissed  the
    Appellant's  appeal  on  asylum  grounds,  on  humanitarian  protection
    grounds, and also on human rights grounds.

2.   The Appellant is a citizen of  Albania  who  at  the  time  of  today's
    hearing is just a few days short of her 21st  birthday.   Her  personal
    details are a matter of record on file: in keeping with  the  anonymity
    order that has been made in these proceedings - and  which  I  continue
    today - I do not rehearse them here.

3.   The Appellant claims to have left Albania on 27 August  2013  by  ferry
    for Italy.  She then passed into France before arriving in  the  United
    Kingdom by boat at the end of August 2013.  It is  her  case  that  she
    entered illegally.

4.   On 27 March 2015 the Appellant made an appointment in  order  to  claim
    asylum; her claim was formally recorded as having been made on 8  April
    2015, on which day the Appellant also underwent a screening  interview.
    In due course the Appellant was interviewed substantively in respect of
    her claim.  Further representations were also made  in  writing  on  20
    July 2015. On 7 October 2015 the  Respondent  refused  the  Appellant's
    application for protection for  reasons  set  out  in  a  'reasons  for
    refusal' letter ('RFRL') of that date.   For  completeness,  it  should
    also be noted that on 25 September 2015 there was  a  decision  to  the
    effect that the Appellant was not a victim of trafficking.

5.   The Appellant, in support of her application for  asylum  and  also  in
    support of her appeal, gave a  narrative  account  of  events  that  is
    summarised at paragraphs (a) to (o) of the RFRL of 7 October 2015.  The
    Appellant's account is also summarised at paragraph 5 of  the  Decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal to the effect  that  the  Appellant  claimed
    that she feared persecution upon return to Albania at the hands of  her
    own family - and in particular her father - as well as the family of  a
    man named 'B' to whom she had been promised in marriage.

6.   The history of the appeal process  in  this  case  is  extensive.   The
    Appellant's appeal was first heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Malins,
    who allowed the appeal with reference to Article 3 of  the  ECHR  in  a
    decision  promulgated  on  14  March  2016.   However,  the  Respondent
    challenged that decision and in due course the decision of Judge Malins
    was set aside by a decision of Upper Tribunal Judge  Reeds  promulgated
    on 13 May 2016.

7.   In such circumstances the appeal came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Pedro on 27 October 2016 to make the decision afresh with all issues at
    large.  Judge Pedro's decision is signed on 23  January  2017  and  was
    promulgated on 24 January 2017.  It may be seen that the  decision  was
    promulgated some few days short of  three  months  after  the  date  of
    hearing.

8.   The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    which in the  first  instance  was  refused  by  Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Macdonald on 21 February 2017.  However, Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Gill granted permission on 7 April  2017  on  two  grounds.   One
    ground related to the delay in  promulgating  the  appeal.   The  other
    ground related to the arguability of whether the credibility assessment
    had been made without reference to background material,  in  particular
    in respect of domestic violence.  A third line of challenge in relation
    to the circumstances surrounding the Appellant's account of having been
    trafficked into the UK was rejected as not revealing an arguable  error
    of law.

9.   The delay point may now be dealt with relatively briefly.   Mr  Collins
    does not seek to pursue this line of challenge in  light  of  the  fact
    that there is a detailed Record of Proceedings prepared by Judge  Pedro
    on the court file.  It is clear that  that  Record  of  Proceedings  is
    contemporaneous: it sets out the  exchange  of  questions  and  answers
    during the live evidence as well as recording the submissions  made  by
    the representatives, and is signed at the bottom with a note  "decision
    reserved" and the date of the hearing given.

10.  In any event in this  context,  bearing  in  mind  the  requirement  to
    demonstrate a nexus between any delay and any defect in the  evaluation
    of the case, it is to be noted that the grounds of challenge  have  not
    sought in any way to suggest that there was any misunderstanding by the
    Judge of the evidence presented by the Appellant, or that any  evidence
    had been omitted from the consideration of the Judge.   Mr  Collins  in
    those circumstances, in my  judgment,  is  realistic  and  sensible  in
    declining to pursue this aspect of the grounds of challenge.

11.  The remaining ground of appeal is that set out at paragraph  6  of  the
    Appellant's Grounds in these terms:

         "It is clear from paragraph 16 of the Determination  that  the  FTT
         Judge did not find the Appellant to  be  "...a  credible  witness".
         When one analyses the  FTT  Judge's  rejection  of  that  part  the
         Appellant's account relating to fear of her father for not entering
         into the marriage he arranged for her as well as fear  of  the  man
         [B], whom she rejected, the FTT Judge signally fails to  take  into
         account the background material before him indicating the pervasive
         and endemic  nature  of  domestic  violence  against  women  cf  in
         particular the CIG 'Women facing domestic violence' May  2016.   In
         effect the FTT Judge has made his findings in a  vacuum.   Further,
         the FTT Judge has also failed to factor into his assessment of this
         part of the claim the fact that the Appellant is  from  Tropoje  in
         the rural far north of Albania where  Kanun  law  predominates  and
         where the general situation facing women is even bleaker  than  the
         larger cities."

12.  Mr Collins acknowledged that the reference in the  Grounds  as  drafted
    to a CIG of May 2016 was in fact in error.  Whilst it appears  that  it
    had been the intention of the Appellant's representatives to file  such
    a document before the First-tier Tribunal - a document  that  had  come
    into existence between the hearing before Judge Malins and the de  novo
    appeal before Judge Pedro - it appears that no such document  was  ever
    filed before the First-tier Tribunal.  To  that  extent  the  Appellant
    cannot rely upon a  submissions  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    failed to have regard to the particular document cited in the Grounds.

13.  Nonetheless Mr Collins identifies that there were materials before  the
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  that  related  to  domestic  violence,  and
    pursues his submissions as if those materials were the ones  identified
    in the grounds of appeal.

14.  In this regard my attention has been  directed  in  particular  to  the
    following materials:

    (i) A passage in the U.S.  State  Department  Report  on  human  rights
    practices in Albania for 2014,  which  is  in  these  terms:  "Domestic
    violence against women  including  spousal  abuse  remained  a  serious
    problem", followed by a number of statistics.   (The  relevant  passage
    may be found at page 18 of the Appellant's bundle that was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.)

     (ii) An Operational Guidance Note produced  by  the  Home  Office  from
    October 2014 in respect of Albania and  in  particular  the  paragraphs
    starting at paragraph 3.20 in relation to victims of domestic violence.
     The concluding paragraph of that section is paragraph  3.20.12,  which
    is in these terms:

         "There is societal discrimination and  violence  against  women  in
         Albania, particularly in the North of the country and women who are
         unemployed, less educated  and  living  in  rural  areas  are  more
         vulnerable  to  violence.   However,  the  government  has   passed
         legislation that outlaws discrimination against women and women are
         not excluded from any employment or occupation.  In addition  there
         are also a number of NGOs who work to promote  women's  rights  and
         campaign against discrimination  and  violence.   For  a  claim  to
         succeed on grounds of domestic violence the onus would  be  on  the
         applicant to demonstrate not only that they  will  face  on  return
         persecutory or inhuman or degrading treatment  but  also  why  they
         would be unable to access  effective  protection  or  alternatively
         relocate elsewhere in Albania  to  escape  localised  threats  from
         members  of  their  family  but  the  reasonableness  of   internal
         relocation must be assessed on a case by  case  basis  taking  full
         account  of  the  individual  circumstances   of   the   particular
         claimant."

15.  It is to be emphasised that in the context of the  submissions  pursued
    before the Tribunal  today  the  focus  is  on  the  relevance  of  the
    background or country information to the assessment of the  Appellant's
    credibility rather than per se as to whether she should have  succeeded
    on her appeal on the basis of being at risk of domestic violence in the
    future.  Although necessarily that was an  element  of  her  case,  the
    focus for the purpose of the 'error of law' analysis is the role  which
    country information plays in the evaluation of a narrative account.

16.  So far as Judge Pedro made reference to the  materials  that  had  been
    filed before the Tribunal, Mr Collins argues that these are essentially
    generic references and do not descend to a necessary and finer analysis
    of the substance of those materials, and to  that  extent  the  Judge's
    approach was not adequate in the  context  of  his  evaluation  of  the
    Appellant's credibility.

17.  Mr Collins submits  that  Judge  Pedro  focused  on  discrepancies  and
    inconsistencies in the Appellant's account, and not that her claim  was
    supported in its genus in that her account  is  plausible  against  the
    background of endemic  violence  against  women  in  Albania  and  more
    particularly in the north of Albania.

18.   In  the  premises  I  make  two  observations  in  respect  of   those
    submissions.  The first is  that  plausibility,  whether  that  be  set
    against the background country information or  by  reference  to  other
    materials or experiences, is not inevitably to be equated to a credible
    or truthful account.  The plausibility of an account may, in an overall
    or 'in the round' consideration, be undermined by other aspects of  the
    account such as inconsistencies.  Secondly, no challenge is made to the
    analysis   of   the   Judge   that   relates   to   discrepancies   and
    inconsistencies.  In this latter context it may be recalled that in the
    'permission to appeal' decision Judge  Gill  considered  Judge  Pedro's
    evaluation and rejection of the Appellant's account in respect  of  her
    claim to have been 'trafficked' essentially sound over  the  course  of
    paragraphs 23, 24 and 26-28 of his Decision.

19.  The Secretary of State has filed a Rule  24  response  dated  26  April
    2017, essentially pleading that the Judge  has  set  out  comprehensive
    reasons for findings in respect of inconsistencies in  the  Appellant's
    account and has adequately reasoned the adverse credibility  conclusion
    reached.

20.  It is against these respective arguments, and  the  background  I  have
    set out in brief summary above, that I turn to a consideration  of  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Pedro.

21.  It is manifest that the Judge has set out in very  considerable  detail
    an analysis of  all  aspects  of  the  Appellant's  personal  narrative
    account, as advanced both in the substance of her application and  over
    the course of her oral evidence. In this regard I echo the observations
    made by Judge Gill in granting permission that  the  Judge  is  a  very
    experienced Judge, and add that in my judgement it is clear that he has
    brought that experience to bear on scrutiny of the Appellant's case.

22.  At paragraph 7  of  the  Decision  the  Judge  summarises  briefly  the
    materials that had been filed before him on behalf of the Appellant and
    then at paragraph 10 states that: "In deciding this appeal and for  the
    avoidance of any doubt I confirm that I have carefully  considered  all
    of the documentary evidence  before  me,  including...  all  additional
    documents  submitted  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  and   the
    respondent."

23.  The Judge sets out his conclusions from paragraph 16 of  the  Decision.
    The opening sentence of paragraph 16 is  this:  "I  did  not  find  the
    Appellant to be a credible witness."   The  Judge  continues:  "On  the
    totality of the evidence before me I find that the credibility  of  the
    Appellant's claim to asylum is seriously undermined.  I shall  now  set
    out in more detail my reasons for having reached this conclusion."

24.  Paragraph 17 commences with a summary of the Appellant's case and  then
    continues in this way:


         "However, on the totality of the evidence before me I do not accept
         that the Appellant has given a truthful  account  of  alleged  past
         events in Albania or events  that  are  alleged  to  have  occurred
         following her arrival in the  United  Kingdom.   I  find  that  the
         Appellant has fabricated her claim to asylum and that she has  done
         so in an attempt to prolong and regularise her stay in  the  United
         Kingdom after having entered the United Kingdom  clandestinely  and
         having remained  here  unlawfully.   I  do  not  accept  that  this
         Appellant has at any time been in need of international  protection
         or that she is in any such need at the present time."

25.  It is clear that that is  a  wholesale  rejection  of  the  Appellant's
    narrative account in all material respects, and not merely  those  that
    might be said to relate to the claimed  violence  -  and  the  risk  of
    future violence - from her father, her family and the man to  whom,  it
    was said, she had been promised in marriage.

26.   At  paragraph  18  the  Judge  cautions  himself   as   to   potential
    vulnerabilities as an element of his consideration of  the  Appellant's
    account.  He says this:

         "In  reaching  the  above  conclusion  I  have  take  into  account
         inconsistencies in the various claims made by the Appellant as well
         as an underlying lack of credibility.  Against this I have borne in
         mind that someone who has undergone traumatic experiences may  give
         different accounts on different occasions and  I  have  also  taken
         into account the lower  standard  of  proof  applicable  to  asylum
         claims.  Notwithstanding this I find that the  inconsistencies  and
         lack of credibility in the account given by the  Appellant  and  to
         which I shall refer in this decision  do  seriously  undermine  the
         credibility of the Appellant's claim to asylum and the past  events
         both in Albania and in the United Kingdom on which it is based."

    In my judgment this is a hallmark of a careful approach recognising the
    potential vulnerability of a person, particularly one claiming, as  the
    Appellant had claimed, to have undergone traumatic experiences.


27.  Notwithstanding, as the Judge indicates, over the following  paragraphs
    - running from paragraphs 19 to paragraph 31 - the Judge sets  out  his
    analysis of the Appellant's account.  Not all of those  paragraphs  are
    directly relevant to the issues that relate to domestic violence: it is
    only those few paragraphs do potentially relate  to  domestic  violence
    that are the focus of the challenge.

28.   In  my  judgment  the  fundamental  difficulty  that  the  Appellant's
    submissions encounter is that  it  is  not  possible  to  identify  any
    passage in the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision that suggests  that
    he took into account as a  material  consideration  that  the  sort  of
    violence and threats the Appellant  had  narrated  were  in  themselves
    implausible.  Indeed, in my judgment to the contrary,  aspects  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge's reasoning take as  a  premise  the  claimed
    fact of violence.

29.  For example, at paragraph 22 the Judge refers to the Appellant's  claim
    of her father being "a very strict man who told her she had no  say  in
    the matter of her betrothal and used to beat her almost  daily  because
    of her reluctance to enter into the marriage."  The  Judge  takes  that
    assertion as a premise into the reasoning that follows:

         "In circumstances in which her father had acted in this manner  and
         she had been promised to [B] by him  with  the  arrangement  having
         already been made I find it lacks credibility that [B]  would  have
         needed to regularly visit the Appellant at her school",


    and so on.

30.  In my judgment that is a clear  instance  of  the  Judge  taking  as  a
    premise the possibility that the Appellant is giving a truthful account
    of violence, but finding that that then does  not  sit  well  with  the
    other aspects of the narrative.  It is not an assessment  that  can  be
    impugned because the Judge did not  have  reference  to  background  or
    country information saying  that  indeed  this  sort  of  violence  was
    endemic.  The Judge does not per se challenge the plausibility  of  the
    claimed  violence  in  his  reasoning;  rather,   allowing   for   such
    plausibility,  he  considered  the  account  undermined  for   internal
    inconsistence because the subsequent events described do not 'sit' with
    the violence of the claimed earlier events. Of  course  ultimately  the
    Judge finds the Appellant's evidence so unworthy of acceptance he  also
    rejects the claims of violence and coercion - but in so doing  he  does
    not at any point rely upon any reasoning premised in  the  unlikeliness
    of a milieu of violence directed towards women.

31.  Paragraph 22 is also significant  in  my  judgment  because  the  Judge
    refers to the Appellant's claim that B was involved in  a  blood  feud.
    The Judge records this:

         "She had indicated at interview that [B] and his family did  things
         around the house as they were involved in a blood feud with another
         family.  Given such circumstances it also  lacks  credibility  that
         [B] would have been willing and able to  make  return  journeys  of
         some six hours two or three times a week, if not  daily  (depending
         upon which version of events given by the Appellant is adopted)  in
         circumstances in which he and his family were involved in  a  blood
         feud in their local area with the usual connotations of confinement
         to the family residence or at least being prudent  and  careful  if
         leaving the family home at all.  When asked to explain this at  the
         hearing the Appellant claimed that [B] and his family did not  care
         about the blood feud as they are  a  dangerous  family  themselves,
         which I find again begs the question as to why [B] would have  been
         so considerably patient enough  to  make  repeated  visits  to  the
         Appellant over an  extensive  period  of  time  in  an  attempt  to
         persuade her to comply  with  the  proposed  marriage  arrangements
         rather than simply enforcing the arrangements upon  the  Appellant.
         Again I find that this all demonstrates the Appellant's  propensity
         to fabricate her claim as she has gone along and that it is riddled
         with inconsistency and a lack of  credibility  because  it  is  not
         based on the truth."

32.  It seems to me very clear that the Judge  is  setting  the  Appellant's
    narrative account in the milieu of a country situation where the  Judge
    has an understanding of Kanun law, at least so far  as  it  relates  to
    blood feuds; and again it seems to me very  clear  that  the  Judge  is
    premising  his  reasoning  when  analysing  the  Appellant's  narrative
    account on an acceptance that the sort of  violence  described  by  the
    Appellant might well take place.  There is nothing  in  this  reasoning
    where the Judge in effect says, 'I do not accept that  the  Appellant's
    account can possibly be plausible because this sort of violence  itself
    is not plausible'.

33.  Further illustrations of this approach can be seen  at  paragraphs  23,
    24 and 25.

34.  At paragraph 23 the Judge says:

         "Given that the Appellant has provided an account of having already
         experienced  an  abusive  father,  being  forced  into  a  marriage
         arrangement with Bashkim, who had threatened to kidnap her and  was
         from a dangerous family, I find it surprising  that  the  Appellant
         would have placed so much trust in a male stranger."

    The Judge's reasoning is, again,  premised  on  an  acceptance  of  the
    plausibility of an account with regard to violence, but a finding  that
    this does not sit well with other aspects of the Appellant's account.

35.  At paragraph 24 reference is  again  made  to  the  Appellant's  father
    being a person who had been claimed to be "strict and  abusive  towards
    her", but the Judge finds that that element of the Appellant's  account
    is not to be reconciled with other aspects of her account in respect of
    her relationship with the person  whom  she  subsequently  claimed  had
    trafficked her to the UK.

36.  Similarly paragraph 25 includes the following:

         "I find such assertions do not sit comfortably with the Appellant's
         claim that she  was  subjected  to  a  very  strict  family  regime
         including almost daily beatings and was the subject of  a  proposed
         forced  marriage  arrangement  made  by  her   father.    In   such
         circumstances it lacks any credibility that her parents, and I note
         that she has claimed that her mother would not disobey her  father,
         would have acquiesced in obtaining a passport and then allow her to
         retain the passport herself with the obvious risk that it could  be
         used by the Appellant as  an  identity  document  for  any  purpose
         including travel."


    Yet again the Judge considers the  internal  consistency  and  internal
    plausibility of the Appellant's account on the premise of what she  has
    said about the violence endemic within her own particular family. There
    is nothing to suggest that the Judge thought such violence in  northern
    Albania was itself unlikely, or that he factored such  a  consideration
    into his evaluation of the Appellant's account.


37.  I should also add in respect of the suggestion that the Judge may  have
    failed to focus on the particular geographical region  from  which  the
    Appellant originates, that he makes reference to Kuk�s and  Tropoje  at
    paragraph 21, and again to Kuk�s at paragraph 23.

38.  In all those circumstances, in my judgment,  the  reasoning  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Pedro in respect  of  credibility  is  immune  from
