               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by DGF, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are  husband  and  wife,  nationals  of  Eritrea.   They
    appealed to the FtT  against  decisions  of  the  respondent  dated  19
    September 2016.

 2. FtT Judge P A Grant-Hutchison dismissed both appeals by a determination
    promulgated on 17 June 2017.

 3. The FtT refused the appellants' application for permission to appeal to
    the FtT.

 4. The appellants sought permission from the  UT,  on  different  grounds,
    attached to their application dated 26 October 2017.

 5. The grounds, read shortly, are that the appellants were found  to  have
    left Eritrea illegally while the first was subject to national  service
    and the second was of draft age, and country  guidance  was  that  they
    were therefore entitled to protection.

 6. Mr Matthews correctly conceded that the grounds  were  well  taken  and
    that the effect of the judge's findings in fact was  that  the  outcome
    should be reversed.

 7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside, and the following
    decision is substituted: the  appeals,  as  brought  to  the  FtT,  are
    allowed.

 8. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
