For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Mensah
    made following  a hearing at Bradford on 21st August 2013.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen  of Algeria, born on  10th  September  1973.
    He applied to come to the UK as the spouse of Naida Mohammedi  on  30th
    September 2012 but was refused entry clearance on 11th  April  2013  on
    the grounds that he could not meet the financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 3. The judge recorded that the Sponsor's gross income  was  ï¿½12,090.   She
    said that the only basis upon which she was being asked to consider the
    case was under Article 8. The judge wrote:

         "In effect the Sponsor explained that the father  of  her  children
         passed away and that is why she has remarried.  The Sponsor is  now
         pregnant and wishes for her husband to join her."

 4. In a very brief determination the judge said that, while  she  accepted
    family life existed, the financial requirements were  important  public
    interest requirements, and there was no clear evidence before her  that
    there were insurmountable obstacles to the Sponsor and Appellant living
    abroad or maintaining their family life as it  has  existed  since  the
    marriage.  She dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

 5. The Appellant sought permission to appeal.  The Sponsor  said  that  it
    was offensive that the Immigration Judge stated that her first  husband
    had passed away and that is why she had remarried. She had  remained  a
    widow for ten years and had been a single mother for that time.

 6. The judge displayed a complete disregard for the fact the couple have a
    son who is 2 years old, and British, and suffers from  health  problems
    including anaemia  and  severe  eczema.   Furthermore  her  two  eldest
    children have lived in the UK for over seven years and have  indefinite
    leave to remain.  Their best interests have not been considered.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge  Brunnen  on  30th  September
    2013 for the reasons stated in the grounds.

 8. On 17th October 2013  the  Respondent  served  a  reply  defending  the
    determination but at the hearing Mrs Pettersen sensibly  conceded  that
    it could not stand and that the decision needs to be remade.

Consideration of whether there is a Material Error of Law

 9. This has the hallmarks of a hurried determination.  The  judge  records
    the Sponsor  as  representing  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  her
    shorthand referral to  her  widowhood  was  bound  to  cause  distress,
    although she did say that she had much sympathy with her  and  she  was
    clearly a hardworking lady.

10. The judge erred in law because the proportionality of the  Respondent's
    decision could not be properly assessed without taking into account the
    best  interests  of  three  children,  one  of  whom  is  British;  (ZH
    (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4).

11. The decision is set aside.

The Sponsor's Evidence

12. Nadia Mohammad explained that she first came to the  UK  with  her  two
    children  in  2001  and  claimed  asylum.   She  was  refused  and  her
    subsequent appeal was dismissed.  They returned to Algeria in 2002  and
    very shortly afterwards her first  husband  died  there.   They  stayed
    together in Algeria for four years until, in 2006, she came back to the
    UK and again applied for asylum. She was granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in 2009 under the Legacy Programme.

13. In January 2010 she met her second husband, the Appellant.  He had come
    to the UK in 2007 and had overstayed.

14. The Appellant returned to Algeria so that he  could   apply  for  entry
    clearance.  Their son was 40 days  old  when  his  father  returned  to
    Algeria.

15. Since he went back the Appellant has visited him  four  times.  On  the
    first visit she took her oldest son and the baby, the second and  third
    times just the baby and the fourth  time  she  went  on  her  own.  She
    explained how hard it was because each time she visited, she  travelled
    700 Km, twelve hours by minicab, to see her sister  who  lived  in  the
    desert. She explained that she did not feel safe in Algiers because she
    was still frightened because what had happened  to  her  there  in  the
    past. The Appellant lives with his parents  in  Algiers  but  when  she
    visited they went together to her sister's because she could  not  stay
    with him there.  The main reason was because of her  safety,  but  also
    the house in Algiers was overcrowded.

16. Her youngest child suffers from anaemia and severe eczema. She produced
    a large amount of medication. She accepted that she could get what  the
    child needed in Algeria.

17. The Sponsor is now pregnant with another child.

Submissions

18. Mrs Pettersen did not seek to challenge  the  strong  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor.  Nor did she suggest that it would be in the best interests of
    the older children to be removed and she acknowledged the right of  the
    British child to remain in the UK.

Findings and Conclusions

19. The Sponsor's evidence was compelling. Whether or not she had  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution in Algiers, her subjective fear of a return
    there was clear for everyone in the court to see.

20. It is accepted that the Sponsor's earnings are below the level  set  by
    the financial requirements of Appendix FM.

21. Section EX1 of Appendix FM reads as follows:

         "EX1. This paragraph applies if (ai) the applicant  has  a  genuine
             and subsisting parental relationship with a child who -

             (aa)     is under the age of 18;

             (bb)     is in the UK;

             (c)  is a British citizen or has lived in  the  UK  cautiously
             for at leapt the seven years immediately preceding the date of
             application; and

             (ii)     it would not be reasonable be expected the  child  to
             leave the UK; or

             (b)  the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
                  with a partner who is in the UK and is a British  citizen,
                  settled in the UK or in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
                  humanitarian  protection,  and  there  are  insurmountable
                  obstacles to family  life  with  that  partner  continuing
                  outside the UK."

22. Section EX1  does  not  apply  to  the  Appellant,  who  is  making  an
    application for entry clearance.  Had he decided to stay in the UK  and
    make an application for indefinite leave to remain as a  spouse  rather
    than doing the correct thing, and returning to Algeria and applying for
    entry clearance through the proper channels, it would have done.

23. In this case there is a 2 year old British citizen child.  It  was  not
    argued that it would be reasonable to expect him to leave the  UK.   He
    lives with his two brothers, who are aged 15  and  13,  who  both  have
    indefinite leave to remain here  and  are  in  school.  The  eldest  is
    shortly to take public examinations.  They have  now  been  here  seven
    years although not at the date of the application.   It  would  not  be
    reasonable to sever this family.

24. Whether or not there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing outside the UK so far as the Sponsor was concerned, was  not
    a matter which  was  explored   at  the  hearing  because  it  was  not
    necessary to do so.  The Sponsor's asylum claim on the second  occasion
    was never determined because she was granted indefinite leave to remain
    under the Legacy Programme. I  would  observe,  however,  that  it  was
    abundantly clear that she has a subjective fear of a return to Algiers,
    that she is clearly devoted to her husband and that if she thought that
    she could  live with him safely in Algeria she would have done so.

25. The fact that the Appellant is in a worse position than he  would  have
    been had he made an in country application for settlement, in  that  he
    meets the requirements of EX1 is a  factor  in  deciding  whether  this
    refusal is proportionate.

26. The Sponsor enjoys family life with  her  spouse  by  virtue  of  their
    relationship and she enjoys family life with  the  three  children  who
    live in the UK.

27. The refusal of entry clearance represents an ongoing interference  with
    their right to enjoy family life but, because the Sponsor is not  in  a
    position to meet the financial requirements of the Rules  the  decision
    is lawful.  The legitimate aim identified here would  be  the  economic
    wellbeing of the country although in this particular case  the  Sponsor
    is working and the Appellant's arrival would not in practice result  in
    any further recourse to public funds other  than  the  tax  credits  to
    which the Sponsor is already entitled.  The Appellant is a graduate and
    was taught for his degree in English and has previous worked for the US
    Embassy in Algeria.  It is likely that he will gain employment  in  the
    UK and be able to further support his family here. There is not  likely
    to be an economic disbenefit to the UK by his arrival, but there  is  a
    legitimate aim identified namely the maintenance of immigration control
    since he does not meet the financial requirements of the Rules.

28. The crucial  issue  in  this  appeal  is  the  proportionality  of  the
    decision.  The best interests of the  British  citizen  child  must  be
    considered first, as must the best interests of the Sponsor's two older
    sons, both of whom are settled in the UK and have been  since 2006.  It
    is clear that their best interests lie  in  staying  here.  The  oldest
    children would not be removed to Algeria and  their  primary  carer  is
    their mother. The youngest child is British. Mrs Pettersen rightly  did
    not suggest that any of the children should go and live in Algeria.

29. The only countervailing factor is the Appellant's  overstaying  between
    2007-10, which is mitigated  by  his  decision  to  follow  the  proper
    procedures and apply for entry  clearance  outside  the  UK.  In  these
    circumstances the best interests  of  the  children  will  dictate  the
    outcome of this appeal.

30. The Sponsor is 25 weeks pregnant. It would be helpful to this family if
    entry clearance could  be issued to the Appellant in time for the birth
    of  his child.

Decision

31. The judge erred in law and her decision is set aside. It is  remade  as
    follows. The Appellant's appeal  is  dismissed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules but allowed on Article 8 grounds.
