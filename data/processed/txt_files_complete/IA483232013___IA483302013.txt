Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Appellants with regard to a determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Obhi) promulgated on 8th April 2014. In her determination  Judge
    Obhi dismissed the Appellants' appeals against the Secretary of State's
    refusal to issue them with residence cards as the family members of  an
    EEA national (the first Appellant's husband).

 2. There was a single issue in this appeal and that was whether or not the
    first Appellant's husband (the Sponsor) was a qualifying person. In the
    determination the Judge makes clear that she heard  evidence  from  the
    Sponsor but not from either Appellant. Throughout the determination the
    Judge  refers  to  the  disarray  of  the  documentary  evidence.   The
    application form had been left blank  with  regard  to  employment  and
    papers were submitted separately. There were also a number of documents
    submitted at the hearing, ambushing the Home Office Presenting  Officer
    who had no opportunity to check them.  However, I  note  there  was  no
    application for an adjournment by the Home Office  Presenting  Officer.
    Furthermore, despite the fact that between the date of application  and
    the date of decision the Sponsor had changed employment, he  failed  to
    notify the  Secretary  of  State  about  that.  Accordingly,  when  the
    Secretary of State contacted the employers she was informed he  was  no
    longer employed by them.  This  led  the  Secretary  of  State  to  the
    inevitable  conclusion,  absent  any  further  information   from   the
    Appellants, that he was no longer a qualifying person.

 3. At paragraphs 22 and 23 of the determination Judge Obhi says:-

         "The evidence is disjointed and unclear. The only real evidence  of
         payments  is  in  respect  of  the  employment  with  Curocare  and
         Clearwater. There is no evidence of  actual  payments  from  Little
         Gems. Although I suspect that the Sponsor was  employed  during  at
         the relevant time (sic), I am struggling on the documents  provided
         to find on a balance of probabilities he was, because of  anomalies
         in the documents, for example a letter offering employment which is
         not on headed notepaper, a contract of employment  in  relation  to
         employment which  started  before  the  offer  of  employment,  the
         absence of any evidence in relation to another employment.  I  note
         that the Sponsor provided (again on the morning of the  hearing)  a
         partial assessment of tax form for the HMRC, this suggests that  he
         was employed and earned in excess of �30,000 for the year ending in
         April 2013, but again it is not the original form and only part  of
         it has been provided.

         The issue between the Secretary of State and the Appellant is  with
         regard to the Sponsor and whether he is a qualified person. I  have
         no doubt that the decision of the Secretary of  State  was  correct
         based on the incomplete application form and  a  complete  lack  of
         information provided at the time of the application.  The  question
         for me is  whether  the  evidence  now  provided  a  sufficient  to
         compensate for that deficiency. The date for the  determination  of
         facts is the date of the hearing, as this is an in country  appeal.
         There is some evidence that the Sponsor's employment is  continuing
         with Clearwater Care, however, I am not satisfied on a  balance  of
         probabilities that he is  employed  as  he  claims.  There  was  no
         explanation for not providing details on the application form. Much
         of the evidence has been provided at the hearing without  providing
         the Secretary of State with an opportunity to consider  the  papers
         and make  independent  enquiries  in  relation  to  the  claims.  I
         consider that in this case such an opportunity should  be  afforded
         to the Secretary  of  State,  particularly  as  there  has  been  a
         previous concern about the Appellant and  her  daughter's  possible
         deception. I am informed that there was an appeal on that issue  in
         2008 when her leave to remain in the UK was curtailed was resolved,
         and that there had been no deception. However the Appellant has not
         given evidence and so could not be asked any questions about that."

 4. I have a degree of sympathy with the First-tier Tribunal Judge who  was
    struggling to make sense of the evidence in this appeal. The Judge  was
    quite justified in her concerns about the disarray of the evidence  and
    the papers coming in piecemeal and like confetti at  the  hearing.  The
    submissions before me were similarly confused.  As  Mr  Bajwa  took  me
    through the grounds he was concentrating  on  where  he  suggested  the
    Judge had made errors in her findings of fact as  to  the  presence  or
    otherwise of documents before her. For example,  the  Judge  said  that
    although there were payslips from the Sponsor's employment with  Little
    Gems there were no corresponding entries  in  the  bank  statement.  Mr
    Bajwa sought to persuade me otherwise but when I asked him to  take  me
    to the bank statements which tallied with the payslips before the judge
    he was unable to do so.

 5. Mr Bajwa stressed that the application form says on its face  that  its
    completion is not mandatory. Whether or not that is the case it, is  an
    extraordinary submission. A person submitting  an  application  to  the
    Home Office for a residence card or any other form of application would
    be well advised to complete the form as fully as possible and to submit
    supporting documentation if they have any hope of succeeding.

 6. The Judge was quite right in her  finding  at  paragraph  23  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State was correct  on  the  basis  of  the
    incomplete application and lack of supporting evidence.

 7. Although Mr Saunders urged me to uphold the determination on the  basis
    that  the  Judge's  findings  based  on  the  confused  evidence   were
    sustainable I find that the Judge did make an error.


 8. Having heard submissions supporting the grounds seeking  permission  to
    appeal in the Upper Tribunal, I can  imagine  the  frustration  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge trying to make sense of this application  and
    appeal. However, it would seem that that frustration  has  led  her  to
    lose sight of the central issue; namely  whether  the  Sponsor,  was  a
    qualifying person at the date of the hearing before her. There  was  in
    the bundle before her copies (and the originals were produced) of a P60
    issued to the  Sponsor   for  the  tax  year  ending  April  2013  from
    Clearwater Care (Hackney) Ltd showing employment during  the  tax  year
    with that company of �105. It was his case that  he  had  just  started
    that employment. Also payslips were produced from the same company  for
    January and February 2014. Those show the amount of  pay  and  tax  and
    national insurance paid to  date  during  the  financial  year.   Those
    clearly indicate that the Sponsor has been and continues in  employment
    with  that  company  since  shortly  before  April  2013.  Accordingly,
    whatever other employment he may or may not have had in  the  past  and
    between the date of application and the date of decision; at  the  date
    of hearing there was clear evidence that he  was  a  qualified  person,
    namely a worker and that remains the case today.

 9. I asked Mr Saunders whether he wished to challenge the veracity of  the
    P60 and the payslips. While indicating that he  did  not  accept  those
    documents he made no specific challenge to them  nor  did  he  seek  an
    adjournment to check their veracity.  He asked me to resolve the issue.
    I was given no reason to doubt that those documents were  genuine.  The
    payslips referred to were two in a whole sequence of payslips from  the
    same origin and I therefore accept that they are what they  purport  to
    be.

10. I therefore find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in its approach  to
    the central issue in this case, namely whether or not at  the  date  of
    hearing the Sponsor was  a  qualifying  person  when  there  was  clear
    evidence that he was. I  therefore  set  aside  the  determination  and
    redecide the appeal which I allow.

11. I would add that the Appellants in this case  would  have  been  better
    advised to complete the  application  forms  properly  and  fully  with
    accompanying documentation. Had they done so  in  all  probability  the
    applications would have been successful thereby avoiding the delay  and
    cost occasioned by an appeal.  Furthermore,  if  the  papers  had  been
    properly in order before the First-tier Tribunal again  they  would  no
    doubt have succeeded thereby also avoiding the cost of this  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

12. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.
