                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1.  The  appellants  are  citizens  of  Bangladesh,  born  01.01.1985  and
    12.01.1978  respectively.   They  each  made  an  application  to   the
    Secretary of State for an EEA  residence  card.   The  application  was
    refused in a decision served on 17.8.16, for reasons that  I  need  not
    need to set out herein.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 2. The appellants lodged appeals before the FtT. The appeals  came  before
    FtT Judge Martin who concluded in a decision dated 08.08.2017 that  the
    FtT did not have jurisdiction to determine the appeal. No findings were
    made in relation to the substance of the appeal. The Judge's conclusion
    was informed by the guidance given by this Tribunal in Sala [2016] UKUT
    00411.

 3. The appellants appealed such decision to the  Upper  Tribunal  and  FtT
    Judge Andrew granted permission. Thus, the matter comes before me.




Discussion

 4. The Court of Appeal has now given consideration to the  very  issue  in
    play in the instant case - see Khan v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755. The Court  concluded  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal had been wrong in its conclusion and rationale in Sala.  It is
    not in dispute that the effect of the decision in Khan, if  applied  to
    this case, is that the First-tier Tribunal was wrong to  conclude  that
    it did not have jurisdiction in this appeal.

 5. For this reason, I set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and remit the appeals back to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  heard
    afresh.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

The appeal are remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.


Signed:                                               Dated: 26.4.18
