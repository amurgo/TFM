Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S A Canter, counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is a material error of law in  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge H Graves ("the FTTJ") promulgated on 7 February 2018, in
    which she dismissed the appellant's appeal against the refusal  of  her
    application for leave to remain on human rights grounds.


 2. Whilst no anonymity direction was made in the  First-tier  Tribunal,  I
    make such a direction because of my references to the  appellant's  and
    her husband's personal circumstances.




Background


 3. The appellant was born on [ ] 1981. She is a citizen  of  Turkey.   The
    appellant and her husband, also a Turkish citizen,  met  at  school  in
    Turkey; they developed a  relationship  and  married  in  2011.   On  9
    September 2013 the appellant was granted entry clearance as a spouse to
    join her husband in the UK. This was valid  until  9  June  2016.   The
    appellant applied for further leave to remain pursuant to  Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules, on 3 June 2016.


 4. The respondent accepted the suitability requirements were met and  that
    the relationship was genuine and subsisting.  However,  she  found  the
    appellant did not meet the  financial  requirements  in  that  she  was
    unable to demonstrate the sponsor  was  earning  a  minimum  income  of
    �18,600. At the date of application the  appellant  was  only  able  to
    demonstrate her husband had been  working  full-time  for  two  months;
    prior to that period he had been ill and had  returned  to  work  part-
    time. His earnings were therefore below  the  required  threshold.  The
    respondent refused the application because the appellant  had  not  met
    the income requirements in Appendix FM. Nor did the  respondent  accept
    the decision breached the UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights.

 5. At the hearing before the FTTJ, the appellant conceded she did not meet
    the requirements of Appendix FM or FM-SE at the  date  of  application.
    However, it was submitted that, at the date of hearing, the appellant's
    husband was earning over the required threshold of �18,600 and that the
    appeal should be allowed on  Article  8  grounds,  outside  the  Rules.
    Original payslips, bank statements and a P60 were provided to the FTTJ.
     The appellant conceded, before the FTTJ, that the bank statements  did
    not reflect the whole of the appellant's  husband's  cash  earnings  as
    they had not all been credited to the account.

 6. The FTTJ concluded "the decision to remove the appellant amounts  to  a
    proportionate interference in the  rights  of  the  appellant  and  her
    husband under Article 8". She further found that "the  availability  of
    entry clearance does constitute an alternative to any finding that  her
    removal is disproportionate in any event".  The appeal was dismissed.

 7.  Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  because  "although  rules  based
    examination of the case is date of application the  Judge  should  have
    considered why, if the appellant met the rules, that removal was  still
    said to be proportionate."  Hence the matter came before me.

Submissions

 8. Mr Canter relied on  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  made  further  oral
    submissions. These can be summarised as follows:

          a. The burden of proof was not on the appellant; it was  for  the
             respondent to justify  the  interference  with  the  protected
             rights.


          b. It was open to the FTTJ to assess the  evidence  to  establish
             whether  the  appellant  fulfilled   the   criteria   in   the
             Immigration Rules at the date of  hearing  (Chikwamba  v  SSHD
             [2008] UKHL 40 and Agyarko v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11).


          c. Contrary to the FTTJ's assertion at  [17]  the  appellant  had
             provided, at  the  date  of  hearing,  the  evidence  required
             pursuant to FM-SE for assessment of income.


          d. The FTTJ had criticised  the  appellant  for  poor  copies  of
             documentary evidence but  this  had  been  undertaken  by  the
             respondent who held those documents.


          e. The FTTJ erroneously stated the payslips did not  reflect  the
             information  in  the  P60.  This  was   factually   incorrect.
             Originals had been given to the FTTJ.


          f. The assessment of the evidence as "patchy" was incorrect;  the
             appellant had provided all the evidence required  pursuant  to
             FM-SE to show his earnings up to and at the date of hearing.


          g.  The  allegation  that  the  appellant  was  not   financially
             independent (for the purposes of  s117B  of  the  Nationality,
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002)  had  not  been  put  to  the
             appellant at the hearing.


          h. Contrary to the FTTJ's findings otherwise, the  appellant  had
             given reasons why she could not stay with her family on return
             to Turkey while making an entry  clearance  application.  This
             should  have  been  taken  into  account  as   part   of   the
             proportionality assessment. It was not.


          i. The FTTJ's comments on Agyarko and Chikwamba did  not  reflect
             the guidance in those authorities.


          j. The FTTJ  found  the  appellant  and  her  husband  inherently
             reliable witnesses; this was sufficient for the appeal  to  be
             allowed.


          k. In summary, the FTTJ's reasoning, assessment of  the  evidence
             and the relevant authorities and legislation  was  flawed  and
             revealed multiple errors of law.

 9. Ms Pal, for the respondent, referred to various findings  made  by  the
    FTTJ. She submitted the FTTJ was unable to find, on the evidence before
    her, that the sponsor was earning the required income. She was entitled
    to find the evidence was lacking. The FTTJ had noted  the  difficulties
    the appellant claimed she would face if she had to return to Turkey  to
    make an entry clearance application. While the FTTJ had noted that  the
    appellant's and sponsor's evidence  was  not  unreliable,  it  was  the
    unreliability of  the  financial  evidence  which  had  caused  her  to
    conclude  there  was  not  a  disproportionate  interference  with  the
    appellant's family life. It was submitted that there  was  no  material
    error of law; the facts as found were open to the FTTJ on the  evidence
    before her.


10. I asked the appellant's counsel, who had appeared before the  FTTJ  for
    the appellant, to identify the documentary  evidence,  as  required  by
    Appendix FM-SE at the date of hearing, which was not before  the  FTTJ.
    He said all relevant documentary evidence was provided to the  FTTJ  to
    show that the  appellant's  sponsor  was  earning  above  the  required
    threshold and that he had done so  for  the  previous  year;  the  only
    aspect of FM-SE which had not been met was  the  requirement  that  the
    sponsor's cash income from salary was reflected in his bank  statements
    (those bank statements having been  produced  also).  I  asked  Ms  Pal
    whether she was able to confirm this was the  case  and  she  confirmed
    that this was indeed the "only item missing".


Findings

11. The only issue to be decided by  the  FTTJ  was  whether  the  decision
    placed the UK in breach of Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.


12. At paragraph 10 the FTTJ identifies  the  burden  of  proof.  The  FTTJ
    states merely, "In human rights appeals, it is  for  the  appellant  to
    show that there has  been  an  interference  with  her  human  rights."
    However, in Article 8 appeals of this type, the burden of proof  is  on
    the appellant to show that the respondent's  decision  interferes  with
    her right to respect for her private and family life.  If the appellant
    is able to establish that, it is then for the respondent to justify the
    interference under Article 8(2). The FTTJ has not cited  the  terms  of
    Article 8 or the guidance in the various authorities such as  Razgar  v
    SSHD [2004] UKHL 27.  This would not ordinarily be necessary if it were
    clear that the relevant guidance had been followed but here there is no
    indication that that is the case.  I can only conclude  that  the  FTTJ
    has misdirected herself as to the burden of proof.

13. The FTTJ refers at [1]  and  [25]  to  the  respondent  having  made  a
    decision to remove the appellant from the UK. That is not the case. She
    made a decision to refuse the application  for  further  leave  remain.
    That is the extent of her decision.  The FTTJ  took  into  account  the
    nature  of   the   respondent's   decision   in   her   assessment   of
    proportionality and this calls into question  the  reliability  of  her
    assessment since it is based, at least in part, on a false premise.

14. It was agreed by the parties before me that the only factor missing for
    a finding that, at the date of hearing,  the  appellant  fulfilled  the
    criteria in Appendix FM-SE was the lack of correlation between his cash
    earnings with the credit entries in  the  bank  statements.   The  FTTJ
    criticised  the  appellant  at  [6]  for  providing  poor   copies   of
    documentary  evidence  but  the  originals   were   provided,   as   is
    acknowledged later in that paragraph. This, together  with  the  agreed
    position before me that the only issue not addressed by  the  appellant
    at the hearing  was  the  correlation  of  his  salary  with  his  bank
    statements, casts doubt on the finding that the evidence was "patchy at
    best" at [20].

15.  The  FTTJ  states  at  [14]  the  appellant   had   not   raised   any
    "compassionate, compelling or exceptional circumstances that  have  not
    been provided for under the Immigration Rules."  In  R  (Chen)  v  SSHD
    (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary separation - proportionality)  IJR
    [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) it was held that Appendix FM does  not  include
    consideration of the question whether it would be  disproportionate  to
    expect an individual to return to his home country  to  make  an  entry
    clearance application to re-join family members in the U.K.  There  may
    be cases in which there are no insurmountable obstacles to family  life
    being enjoyed outside the U.K. but where temporary separation to enable
    an individual to  make  an  application  for  entry  clearance  may  be
    disproportionate. In all cases, it will be for the individual to  place
    before the Secretary of State evidence that such  temporary  separation
    will interfere disproportionately with  protected  rights.   Both  this
    appellant and her husband had explained in their statements  that  they
    could not  remain  in  Turkey  for  more  than  a  "short  visit".  The
    appellant's husband states that when the appellant applied for a spouse
    visa from Turkey in about 2011 it "took her about 2 years to  obtain  a
    visa. During this time her parents gave us a very hard time".  The FTTJ
    concluded at [25] that she  had  "not  found  that  the  appellant  and
    sponsor's oral and documentary evidence  is  inherently  unreliable  or
    incredible." Despite this the FTTJ did not take into  account,  in  her
    assessment of proportionality,  the  impact  of  a  possible  two  year
    separation while the appellant applied for entry clearance. Given  that
    the couple  were  attempting  to  have  a  child  and  had  encountered
    difficulties  with  conception,  such  a  separation  would  amount  to
    compassionate circumstances.

16. The FTTJ has, in considering  the  issue  of  proportionality  at  [20]
    decided this was not a "case  where  the  appellant's  application  was
    refused for a  technical  issue,  ...  This  is  an  appeal  where  the
    application  did  not  meet  the  requirements,  both  substantive  and
    evidential."  This misses the point. It  had  been  conceded  that  the
    appellant did not meet the Rules at the date of decision, the issue  to
    be decided  was  the  proportionality  of  the  interference  with  the
    appellant's right to a family life.    The  FTTJ  has  failed  to  have
    regard to the issue of whether she fulfilled the criteria in the Rules,
    as regards her family life, at  the  date  of  hearing.  It  is  highly
    relevant that she considered the  witness  evidence  to  be  inherently
    reliable; that evidence was that the sponsor had earned over the income
    threshold for over a year by the date of the hearing.  This a factor of
    relevance to the assessment the public interest pursuant to s117B(3) of
    the 2002 Act.  The FTTJ's findings suggest she was looking back at  the
    situation  at  the  date  of  decision  rather  than  the   appellant's
    circumstances at the date of hearing: see for example the reference  to
    the  appellant  being  "unable  to  meet  the   substantive   financial
    requirements of the application" at [24] where she also refers  to  the
    sponsor's income having fallen well below the threshold; this was prior
    to the date of application and did not reflect  the  situation  at  the
    date of hearing.

17. The FTTJ has found "a lack of documentary evidence" [21],  but,  before
    me, it was agreed that the appellant had produced  sufficient  evidence
    to comply with the financial requirements of Appendix FM and FM-SE with
    the exception that the sponsor's cash salary was not reflected  in  his
    bank statements. The FTTJ appears to  have  focussed  at  [21]  on  the
    documentary evidence from the  date  of  application  to  the  date  of
    decision. This does not address the appellant's case which was that she
    met the income threshold at the date of hearing. The appellant provided
    documentary evidence, compliant with FM-SE (save  with  regard  to  the
    content of bank statements), covering the period required by FM-SE,  as
    at the date of hearing (February 2018).  The FTTJ  makes  much  of  the
    fact that the respondent had not had the opportunity to "verify,  check
    and investigate claimed income" but there  was  no  suggestion  in  the
    reasons for refusal that the  sponsor's  documentary  evidence  of  his
    earnings had given rise to concerns in this regard and the sponsor  had
    remained in the same employment as that disclosed to the respondent.


18. MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10 makes it clear that, in the proportionality
    assessment, the FTTJ is entitled to take into account  all  sources  of
    income, including from third parties, subject to appropriate  scrutiny.
    The FTTJ has focussed on the documentary evidence solely  by  reference
    to the Rules.  While  this  is  appropriate  to  identify  whether  the
    appellant fulfilled the criteria in the Rules at the date of hearing, a
    wider  assessment  is  required   for   the   purposes   of   assessing
    proportionality (MM (Lebanon) refers). The  FTTJ  failed  to  undertake
    that wider assessment, instead focussing on  adherence  to  FM-SE.  She
    should have taken into account the totality of the evidence,  including
    the witness evidence which she had found inherently reliable.  Were  it
    not for the absence of record in the bank statements of  the  sponsor's
    income, the appellant would otherwise have demonstrated  she  fulfilled
    the criteria in Appendix FM-SE  for  the  grant  of  further  leave  to
    remain.  There was reliable and credible  evidence  (according  to  the
    FTTJ) to explain the reason for that gap in the evidence.

19. The  FTTJ  refers  to  s117B  and  the  public  interest  in  financial
    independence at [22] but has only taken into account,  in  making  that
    assessment, the inability of the appellant to meet the requirements  in
    FM-SE. She has not carried out a holistic assessment of the appellant's
    financial circumstances at the date of hearing. For example, it is  the
    appellant's evidence that she worked part-time until the refusal of her
    application when she was no longer permitted to work. The FTTJ has also
    ignored the  appellant's  evidence,  which  she  considered  inherently
    reliable, that the appellant would work again if permitted  to  do  so.
    These are matters of relevance to the assessment of  financial  status.
    Such  evidence  should  have   been   taken   into   account   in   the
    proportionality assessment (MM (Lebanon)).

20. This is a  decision  which  is  fatally  flawed  as  a  result  of  the
    application of the wrong burden of proof and an  inadequate  assessment
    of the evidence. These are fundamental errors of law  which  taint  the
    assessment of proportionality.  Had they  not  been  made  the  outcome
    might have been different.

21. I invited submissions as to how to proceed and Mr Canter  indicated  he
    would be content for the matter to be heard afresh in this tribunal. Ms
    Pal had no view as to how to proceed.

22. There is no suggestion that the evidence needs to be updated and I  see
    no need for a fresh hearing.  The parties are in agreement  as  to  the
    evidence before the FTTJ at the date of hearing. I can also  take  into
    account the finding of the FTTJ (which was accepted by Ms Pal) that the
    evidence of the two  witnesses  is  inherently  reliable.  I  therefore
    remake the decision on the basis of the evidence before the FTTJ.

23. I bear in mind the public interest factors including  those  in  s117A-
    s117C of the 2002 Act. The maintenance of effective immigration control
    is in the public interest.  This appellant is not  an  overstayer.  She
    has complied with the Immigration Rules. She has the benefit  of  leave
    pursuant to s3C of the  Immigration  Act  1971.   She  has  had  lawful
    immigration status throughout her stay  in  the  UK.   Her  immigration
    record is exemplary.

24. At the date of hearing, the appellant had  produced  all  the  required
    evidence for compliance with Appendix FM-SE with the exception that her
    sponsor's bank statements did not reflect  the  totality  of  his  cash
    income.  A reasonable and credible explanation  has been  provided  for
    that anomaly.  The remaining evidence demonstrates his  income  exceeds
    the threshold of �18,600 for the required  period  (as  agreed  by  the
    parties before me).  Were the appellant to return to  Turkey  to  apply
    for entry  clearance,  she  would  be  in  a  position  to  demonstrate
    compliance with the Rules with the  exception  of  the  requirement  to
    provide bank statements which  correlate  with  her  husband's  income.
    That said, since the sponsor is now aware of this provision and in  the
    same employment, he could organise his financial affairs to ensure that
    his bank statements reflect his cash earnings  to  comply  with  FM-SE.
    Were he to do so, and there is no  reason  to  suggest  otherwise,  the
    appellant would certainly be granted entry clearance.

25. The FTTJ's findings on the credibility of the witness evidence have not
    been challenged  by  the  respondent.  I  therefore  adopt  the  FTTJ's
    paragraph 3 and find  that  the  appellant  had  worked  part-time  for
    Eastenders Kebab about two months before her leave to remain was due to
    expire. She was unable to continue that work when her  application  was
    refused but it is her evidence that "had my visa application  not  been
    rejected, I would have carried on working at Eastenders Kebab. Once  my
    visa is granted, I wish to continue working."   On  this  evidence  the
    appellant would be financially independent were she permitted to remain
    in this country. She would not be a burden on state.

26. The appellant speaks English, as evidenced by her being  granted  entry
    clearance as a spouse.

27. The appellant's husband has indefinite leave to remain in  the  UK;  he
    has lived in this country for 16 years;  he  has  permanent  employment
    here and his evidence is that he would lose that employment were he  to
    move abroad. He would find it difficult to find work in Turkey. If  the
    appellant and her husband were to relocate, the appellant's husband may
    lose his immigration status: it took about two  years  for  his  wife's
    spousal visa to be granted when she applied in  about  2011.   Thus  he
    would be out of the UK for a period of about two years which would  put
    his indefinite leave to remain at risk.


28. Were the appellant to return to Turkey to apply for entry clearance  to
    rejoin her husband here, this would cause extended disruption to  their
    family life. It would cause an additional financial burden because  she
    would be unable to stay with her family for more than a short period of
    about a week.  It is her evidence that, due to her cultural and  social
    norms, she would be unable to work in Turkey as a  married  woman;  she
    would be reliant on her husband  in  the  UK.  The  appellant  and  her
    husband are having difficulty conceiving a child.  A  separation  would
    set back their attempts to do so. This would have a significant  impact
    on their family life.

29. The inability of the appellant to meet the documentary requirements  as
    regards her husband's employment was due in part to his ill health  and
    inability to work  full-time  for  the  prescribed  period  before  her
    application. Rather than delay making her application until her husband
    returned to full-time work, she made it before the expiry of her  leave
    to remain, albeit she could not, as a result  of  his  part-time  work,
    meet the  income  requirements  in  the  Rules.   This  demonstrates  a
    willingness to adhere to the Rules and a recognition by  the  appellant
    of the importance of not overstaying her leave here.  There is no doubt
    the appellant's husband is working full time and earns in excess of the
    threshold income.  His failure to meet the Rules arises from a lack  of
    specific reference to his total earnings in his bank statements.   This
    carries less weight in the proportionality exercise given the exemplary
    immigration record of the appellant and the fact that she would, in due
    course, certainly meet the entry clearance criteria were she to make an
    application for entry clearance in  Turkey.   There  is  little  public
    interest in requiring her to return to Turkey and to wait the requisite
    number of months for her husband to transfer his monthly cash income to
    his bank account when there is reliable and credible evidence as to his
    earnings before the tribunal.


30. There are compelling circumstances in  this  case:  the  appellant  was
    unable to demonstrate she met the criteria in the Rules at the date  of
    application because of her husband's illness and  consequent  inability
    to work.  If she were required to return to Turkey to apply  for  entry
    clearance this would entail a prolonged period of separation  from  her
    husband, judging by the length of time it  took  when  she  applied  in
    about 2011: two years. This, at a time when the couple  are  attempting
    to start a family and are experiencing difficulties with conception.


31. For these reasons, given the particular circumstances of  this  family,
    the respondent's decision gives rise to a disproportionate interference
    with the appellant's and her husband's rights to  a  family  life  when
    weighed  against  the  public   interest   in   maintaining   effective
    immigration control.

Decision

32. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
    material errors on points of law.


33. I set aside the decision the remake it by allowing the appeal.

Anonymity Direction

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) we make an anonymity order. Unless the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
appellant. This direction applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings. We do so in  order  to  avoid  a  likelihood  of  serious  harm
arising to the appellant from the contents of his protection claim.

Fee Award

The FTTJ did not make a fee award. I have  considered  making  a  fee  award
because I have allowed the appeal  but  do  not  make  such  an  award.  The
appellant succeeded largely because she was able to produce at  the  hearing
the requisite documentary evidence  to  demonstrate  she  met  most  of  the
criteria in the Immigration Rules; her own and her husband's  oral  evidence
was required to explain the absence of correlation between  the  entries  in
the bank statements and the appellant's husband's evidence of income.
