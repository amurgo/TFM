Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Patel, Lei Dat & Baig Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Sudan born  in  1986.  He  appeals  with
    permission against the  26th  July  2017  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Moxon) to dismiss his protection appeal.







    Anonymity Order

 2. This appeal concerns a claim for international protection.  Having  had
    regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

    Background and Matters in Issue

 3. The Appellant asserts a well-founded fear of persecution in  Sudan  for
    reasons of his ethnicity. He claims to be  a  member  of  the  Massalit
    tribe, a non-Arab ethnic group from Darfur.  It is common  ground  that
    if the Appellant can  establish  to  the  lower  standard  that  he  is
    Massalit, then he will be entitled to protection under  Article  1A  of
    the 1951 Refugee Convention: AA (non-Arab Darfuris - relocation)  Sudan
    CG [2009] UKAIT 00056, MM (Darfuris) Sudan CG [2015] UKUT 00010 (IAC).

 4. In her decision to refuse, dated 12th October 2016,  the  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department does not accept  that  the  Appellant  is
    Massalit. It is noted that during his screening interview, and  in  his
    application for NASS support, he gave his ethnicity as 'Salamat'.   The
    Appellant further claims to have been educated to the  extent  that  he
    was able to take on a teaching role during his military  service:  this
    is inconsistent with the country background  evidence  which  indicates
    that very few non-Arab Darfuris receive any education.  The  fact  that
    the Appellant had been conscripted would also tend to indicate that  he
    is not Massalit, as did his fluency in Arabic. There  was  no  evidence
    before the Secretary of State that the Appellant spoke Massalit and  in
    these circumstances she was not prepared to attach much weight  to  the
    Appellant's correct answers when asked  about  the  African  tribes  of
    Darfur.  Having  reached  those  findings  on  the  central  matter  of
    ethnicity the Secretary of State went  on  to  reject  the  Appellant's
    claims that he had been subjected to arrest and detention in Sudan, and
    that he had been falsely accused of attempting to murder  a  well-known
    figure in the regime, a Mr Ali Khushayb.

 5. When the appeal came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  Appellant
    relied on the following evidence:

          i) A witness statement in which he explained inter alia  that  at
             the screening interview there had been confusion  between  him
             and the interpreter. He had  told  the  interpreter  that  his
             mother is Salamat and his father  is  Massalit  but  only  the
             former fact was recorded. When the record had been  read  back
             to him he had corrected this mistake by way of letter from his
             solicitors dated 11th May 2016.  The  Appellant  disputed  the
             assertion that his NASS form said he was Salamat: that too had
             been  amended  and  now  reads  "Msaleit  Africa".    He   had
             undertaken national service in a civilian capacity.

         ii) An expert report by Mr Peter Verney. Mr Verney  is  an  expert
             well known to the Tribunal. Mr Verney found  the  Respondent's
             assertions as to the Appellant's likely level of education  to
             be "bizarre" and "false". He attested that many Massalit speak
             Arabic. Having interviewed the Appellant himself, and read all
             the relevant documents, Mr Verney concluded that the Appellant
             had "demonstrated convincingly" that he is from  the  Massalit
             tribe as claimed.  He notes that the Appellant  speaks  Arabic
             with a notable Darfuri accent, and is able to  speak  Massalit
             to an extent that made it unlikely that he  did  not  have  at
             least one parents from that tribe.   His  description  of  the
             area that he claims to come from was "completely lifelike". Dr
             Verney found nothing in the account  to  be  damaging  to  the
             Appellant's credibility as a witness. He also  explained  that
             Ali Khushayb, the man whom the Appellant is accused of  trying
             to kill, is wanted by the International Criminal Court and  is
             well known for his involvement in attacks on the Salamat,  the
             tribe of the Appellant's mother.  The Respondent's theory that
             the Sudanese authorities  would  not  use  Darfuris  to  fight
             against other Darfuris is demonstrably wrong:  that  has  been
             their policy from the outset.

        iii) A witness statement from AS, a man recognised as a refugee  on
             the grounds that he is from the Massalit  tribe.  AS  attested
             that he knew the Appellant personally in Sudan and that  knows
             him to be Massalit.

         iv) A letter from the Msaalit Tribe Association  of  South  Darfur
             State  attesting  that  in  their  opinion  the  Appellant  is
             Massalit.

          v) A medical report by Professor Kayvan Shokrollahi stating  that
             the Appellant bears four areas of scarring, to  his  head  and
             leg.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal drew adverse inference from  the  recording  of
    the  term  'Salamat'  in  the  screening  interview,  noting  that  the
    Appellant had signed to say that he understood the interpreter, and had
    been inconsistent as to whether he had raised problems at the interview
    itself.  It further  found  against  the  Appellant  on  the  following
    matters. The Appellant had not claimed to  be  afraid  because  of  his
    membership of a particular tribe: he  had  described  being  afraid  of
    arrest  and  being  pressured  into  joining  a  militia.    The   NASS
    application said that the Appellant is Salamat.  The Appellant has been
    inconsistent about how much Massalit he actually spoke. As to Mr Verney
    the Tribunal found that he had sought to  advocate  for  the  Appellant
    rather than acting as an expert for the court.  He  had  used  "emotive
    language" towards the Home Office. He is not a linguistics  expert  and
    should not present himself as such. It is unclear how  he  reached  his
    conclusions about the Appellant's ethnicity.    His  comment  that  the
    Appellant "looks Massalit" is unexplained and has no scientific  basis.
     The Tribunal considers that Mr Verney may not  have  had  all  of  the
    relevant information before him, for instance it is unclear whether  he
    had the NASS application. The Tribunal nevertheless recognised that  Mr
    Verney is an expert and that considerable weight could be  attached  to
    his evidence about Sudan.

 7. The determination goes on to identify a number of discrepancies in  the
    account given about what happened to the Appellant in Sudan. He  claims
    that he was beaten with plastic pipes on his back and legs but the only
    scars that the doctor found were potentially from pliers being  applied
    to his ears and from being kicked in the head:  "these  inconsistencies
    considerably  undermine  the  Appellant's  account   of   having   been
    tortured". The medical report fails  to  consider  whether  there  were
    other causes of the scarring.  In respect of AS the Tribunal notes that
    he was found to be credible, and Massalit, by another  judge  and  that
    this adds weight to his testimony; however  it  is  undermined  by  his
    "evasive" evidence under cross-examination and the fact  that  the  two
    men were inconsistent about how long it had been since  they  saw  each
    other.   The  reliability  of  the  letter  from  the   Msaalit   Tribe
    Association is undermined by the "various adverse credibility  findings
    made against the Appellant".  Finally weight  was  to  be  attached  to
    various matters arising under  section  8  of  the  Asylum  Immigration
    (Treatment of  Claimants  etc)  Act  2004.    The  First-tier  Tribunal
    concluded that the Appellant had not discharged the burden to the lower
    standard of proof in showing that he was Massalit and  the  appeal  was
    dismissed.

 8. The Appellant now challenges that decision on several grounds:

          i) Failure to give proper consideration to material evidence;

         ii) Failure to give reasons;

        iii) Failure to engage with medical report.

 9. For the Respondent Mr Bates defended the decision on all grounds.

    Discussion and Findings

10. At the centre of this appeal is the expert report of Mr  Peter  Verney.
    The Tribunal recognised that Mr Verney is an expert [at �47], and  that
    his evidence "about Sudan" should attract considerable weight [at �94].
      It nevertheless declined  to  give  any  significant  weight  to  his
    conclusions about this particular Appellant.

11. The first reason it give for so doing, at paragraph 92 of the decision,
    is that Mr Verney is said to have  asked  'leading  questions'  in  his
    interview with the Appellant, not to have acted with impartiality,  and
    at "various stages" to have advocated on the Appellant's behalf.

12. Before me Mr Bates accepted that the Tribunal had not set out in  terms
    what it meant when it said that  Mr  Verney  had  asked  the  Appellant
    "leading questions"; nor does the determination explain in what way  he
    might have "advocated on behalf  of  the  Appellant".  He  nevertheless
    submitted that these were findings open to the Tribunal.  He took me to
    Mr Verney's transcript of his interview with the  Appellant  where  the
    following exchange is recorded:

         "15.     Is it correct that you told the HO  that  your  father  is
         from the Masalit tribe and your mother is from the Salamat tribe? I
         asked him.

         16.      Correct, he said.

         17.      Because people trace ethnic identity  principally  through
         the paternal line, this means you are regarded as Masalit, correct?

         18.      Yes, he said".

    Mr Bates submitted that it was inappropriate for Mr Verney to have  led
    the Appellant in this way and that his  approach  must  detract  weight
    from  the  positive  conclusions  he  reached  about  the   Appellant's
    ethnicity.

13. Setting aside the obvious point  that  Mr  Bates  was  now  seeking  to
    perfect the determination by giving reasons where the Tribunal had not,
    there are two further problems arising from his submissions. First,  Mr
    Verney does not  appear  himself  to  attach  weight  to  the  positive
    responses he elicited from the Appellant; it is therefore difficult  to
    see how his overall conclusion could be tainted by them. Secondly,  and
    more importantly, the passages that Mr Bates took me to (and,  it  must
    be presumed the passages that the Tribunal had in  mind  at  its  �92),
    must be read in context. They are  under  the  heading  "transcript  of
    interview and observations" and come after the following explanation:

         "I told him I would go through the refusal decision letter with him
         to check that his account has been understood properly and  address
         any points arising in the refusal" (my emphasis).

    Seen in this context it is very difficult to see what could possibly be
    objectionable about Mr Verney reciting matters raised  in  the  refusal
    letter to check if he had understood the issues properly.  He  was  not
    testing the Appellant's evidence - that was not his role. His role  was
    to evaluate the plausibility  of  the  claim  against  his  own  expert
    knowledge of Sudan and to offer an opinion  on  whether  this  man  was
    Massalit. In doing so he was perfectly entitled to begin his assessment
    by checking that he understood the basis of the Appellant's claim.  The
    fact that these questions may have been 'leading' was neither here  nor
    there.

14. The Tribunal's reasoning on this point is therefore set aside.  It  did
    not give cogent reasons for impugning  Mr  Verney's  objectivity  as  a
    witness (itself a serious error), and in making its findings failed  to
    take important evidence into account, namely the passage  that  I  have
    just set out which explains why the questions were put  in  the  manner
    that they were. There was further no attempt to reconcile  the  adverse
    findings with the evidence of Mr Verney - again unchallenged - that  he
    rejects the claims of "non-Arab connection" in  approximately  half  of
    the cases referred to him.   If that assertion was accepted,  which  it
    expressly was at the Tribunal's �93, it is all the  more  difficult  to
    understand the overall conclusion that his evidence was somehow tainted
    by partiality.

15. As  to  whether  Mr  Verney  was  entitled  to  offer  opinion  on  the
    Appellant's language skills the Tribunal  places  what  appears  to  be
    considerable weight on the fact that Mr Verney is not, by profession, a
    linguist.   At paragraph 96 the Tribunal consider Mr Verney's  evidence
    that the Appellant spoke with a Darfuri accent and knew  some  Massalit
    words and finds: "I do not accept that Mr Verney has the  expertise  to
    give this evidence and in any event he has failed to fully outline  his
    rational". At paragraph 95 it states that it is unclear whether all  of
    the questions asked are in the report, whether the  Appellant  got  the
    answers correct, how close the Massalit is to the  Arabic  and  whether
    the Appellant pronounced the words correctly.

16. Mr Verney made no claims to be a linguist. What he does say,  and  what
    is uncontested, is that he has been working  in  or  'on'  Sudan  since
    1977. He has  worked  in  various  capacities  for  a  number  of  NGOs
    including Save the Children. He has held a number of academic positions
    including at the School of Oriental and African Studies in  London  and
    at the Khartoum Academy of Administrative Sciences. He has  worked  for
    the Sudanese government in both the Education  and  Culture  ministries
    and has been commissioned as a Special Advisor on  Darfur  by  our  own
    House of Commons.  He asserts, and again this was not  contested,  that
    he speaks fluent Arabic, and in particular  "conversational  colloquial
    Sudanese".   He explains  that  he  learned  the  language  in  the  12
    continual years that he spent living in Sudan, and because for 9  years
    he has been married to a Sudanese woman.     In his assessment  of  the
    Appellant Mr Verney states that  he  communicated  with  him  directly,
    using this form of colloquial Arabic, but  that  there  was  an  Arabic
    speaking interpreter there to offer assistance.   It  is  against  that
    background, all set out in detail  in  Mr  Verney's  report,  that  his
    evidence on the Appellant's language skills had to be judged.

17. In my view it borders on perversity to suggest that Mr Verney would not
    be able to comment on the Appellant's regional accent.   He has over 30
    years association with Sudan, is married to a Sudanese woman and  spent
    12 years of his life continuously living  there  as  well  as  numerous
    other periods of stay  and  visits.    He  has  spent  time  living  in
    Geneina, the Western  Darfur  homeland  of  the  Massalit.  His  entire
    working life revolves around the country and its nationals.  He  speaks
    Arabic, and specifically, speaks "colloquial Sudanese".      I  do  not
    think, in those circumstances, that he needs to be a qualified linguist
    to be able to say that the Appellant  speaks  with  a  Darfuri  accent.
    Presumably, given his adherence to the Ikarian  Reefer  principles,  Mr
    Verney would not have offered this opinion if he did not think  himself
    able to give it. I would note that the Tribunal appears to  have  taken
    no issue with the opinion formed by an  immigration  officer  and  Home
    Office interpreter - presumably neither qualified linguists - that  the
    Appellant speaks 'Sudanese' Arabic, itself an assessment of accent  (at
    �11 RFRL).

18. As to Mr Verney's qualification to comment on whether the Appellant can
    speak Massalit it is of course  not  the  case  that  he  purported  to
    conduct a linguistic analysis of fluency. What  he  did  was  give  the
    Appellant a series of Arabic words  and  asked  him  for  the  Massalit
    equivalent - dark skin, man, the numbers 1-10, greetings, good morning,
    good evening, 'how are you?' and 'I am going to market'. He checked the
    answers against his own information  and  with  a  Massalit  colleague.
    Paragraph 115 of his report records that the answers were correct.  The
    Tribunal is therefore wrong as a matter  of  fact  to  state  that  the
    report did not set out the questions asked, or  whether  the  Appellant
    got them right. The insinuation that Mr Verney might have  deliberately
    omitted to record any answers  that  the  Appellant  got  wrong  is  an
    allegation unsupported by  the  evidence,  and  is  at  odds  with  the
    Tribunal's own acceptance of Mr Verney's record.   If he is  an  expert
    who has had the professional integrity to give - if I can put  it  like
    this - negative opinion on approximately half of the cases referred  to
    him, in the absence of any indication to the contrary it can be assumed
    that Mr Verney will act with probity. The Tribunal has  further  failed
    to take into account  the  evidence  in  the  report  itself  about  Mr
    Verney's methodology, which has been  approved  by  Professor  Emeritus
    (Oxon) Wendy James FBA, CBE. and Professor Douglas H Johnson of  Oxford
    University who has confirmed to Mr Verney that his  method  is  "pretty
    much standard for field working linguists who  don't  themselves  speak
    the languages they are studying".   Finally  I  would  note  that  this
    particular  issue  was  not  raised  by  the  Respondent  who  made  no
    criticisms of Mr Verney's ability to comment on  the  use  of  Massalit
    terms or the Appellant's Darfuri accent.  If this was evidence that the
    Tribunal was minded to reject it might fairly have put the  Appellant's
    representatives on notice of this,  given  Mr  Verney's  suggestion  at
    paragraph 116 of his report:

         "If my assessment of his language capability is not accepted,  then
         it is clear that he shows  sufficient  merit  to  be  subjected  to
         further enquiry with a recognised Masalit speaker".

19. I need say  no  more  about  Mr  Verney's  overall  assessment  of  the
    Appellant save to note that he himself placed  limited  weight  on  his
    opinion of the Appellant's appearance,  accepting  that  it  is  not  a
    matter upon which one could place "excessive reliance". The  extent  of
    his evidence was that the Appellant's claim  to  be  Massalit  was  not
    inconsistent with his appearance, since he  "clearly  resembled"  other
    Massalit that Mr Verney had met, and perhaps  more  importantly,  would
    have the non-Arab appearance that might  arouse  the  interest  of  the
    Sudanese security services.  This was of some significance to the  risk
    assessment,  yet  it  does  not  feature  in  the   determination.   In
    considering how the Appellant would fare under  questioning  about  his
    origins Mr Verney writes:

         "He cannot lie or dissemble in the face of such questions, as  they
         will know from his  appearance  and  accent  that  he  is  non-Arab
         Darfuri".

20. In light of the foregoing I am satisfied that this is  a  determination
    that cannot stand. In respect of that one central piece of  evidence  -
    the Verney report - the First-tier Tribunal has failed to take material
    evidence into account,  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons,  has  made
    mistake of fact and has arguably made perverse findings.

21. I need not therefore dwell at length on the remaining elements  of  the
    challenge.

22. Some complaint is made about the approach taken to the evidence of  AS.
    This was witness who had been found to be "truthful" by the Tribunal in
    his own case and whose evidence before the First-tier Tribunal in  this
    case was found to be largely consistent. His testimony was nevertheless
    apparently rejected because he was "evasive"  under  cross-examination.
    Mr Bates accepted that no explanation is given for that finding and  he
    was unfortunately not able to read the note taken by the  HOPO  to  see
    what might have led to it. It is an  error  of  law  to  reach  adverse
    credibility findings about a witness without giving clear reasons  why.
    The evidence of AS is a) that he is Massalit b) that many years ago  he
    knew the Appellant in Sudan and c) that to the best  of  his  knowledge
    and belief the Appellant is also  Massalit.  There  were,  in  essence,
    three options open to the Tribunal in assessing this evidence. He could
    be found to be truthful, he could be found to be truthful but  mistaken
    or unreliable about the Appellant's tribal identity,  or  he  could  be
    found to be lying.  I cannot discern from the  determination  which  of
    the three it was.

23. The reliability of the letter from the Massalit Tribal  Association  is
    found to be  "undermined  by  the  various  credibility  findings  made
    against the  Appellant",  in  what  purports  to  be  a  Tanveer  Ahmed
    assessment. I am not satisfied that Tanveer Ahmed is authority for  the
    proposition that item of evidence 'B' can be discounted because item of
    evidence 'A' has already been rejected. The approach is to consider all
    of the evidence in the round, and apply the lower standard of proof.  I
    am not satisfied that this is what has been done here.

24. Had the appeal rested simply on ground (iii) I would have dismissed it.
    The medical report that the Appellant sought to rely upon purported  to
    be compliant with the Istanbul Protocol but was  couched  in  extremely
    brief terms. Mr Bates was quite right to point to an obvious deficiency
    in the evaluation of the scars since  Professor  Shokrollahi  does  not
    consider what the alternative causes of the  scarring  might  be.    At
    best they are each found to be  'consistent'  with  the  claimed  cause
    (torture with pliers, beating) and in those circumstances the  Tribunal
    was bound to place limited weight on those findings.

25. Given what I have said, particularly about Mr Verney's report  and  its
    contents, it might be  assumed  that  this  is  an  appeal  that  could
    properly be re-made by the Upper Tribunal without the need for  further
    hearing. What this  decision  has  not  however  touched  upon  is  the
    Secretary of State's continued challenge to the Appellant's account  of
    past persecution in Sudan. It is her contention that this narrative  is
    fiction, and that this, coupled with the NASS report and the  screening
    interview, is enough to displace the  Appellant's  evidence  about  his
    ethnicity, even corroborated  as  it  is  by  Mr  Verney,  AS  and  the
    association.   I therefore consider it appropriate that the  matter  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal so that it may be heard afresh by a
    First-tier Tribunal Judge other than Judge Moxon.   Ms  Patel  accepted
    that this was a proper disposal of the matter.

    Decisions

26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains  errors  of  law  such
    that it must be set aside. The decision will be remade de novo  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

27. There is an order for anonymity.
