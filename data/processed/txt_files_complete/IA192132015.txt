Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N. Ahmed, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Paragraph Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who  first  entered  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 4 Student with leave until 18 September 2012.  He was
    last granted further leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  until  20
    September 2014.  He made an application for further leave to remain  as
    a Tier 4 (General) Student, which was refused on  11  May  2015  and  a
    decision was made to remove him from  the  United  Kingdom  by  way  of
    directions under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
    Act 2006.

 2. The appellant appealed that decision and following a  consideration  of
    his appeal on papers at Sheldon Court, Birmingham, Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Asjad, in a  decision  promulgated  on  21  August  2015,
    dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 3. Permission to appeal was sought and granted by Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal J. M. Holmes on 17 December 2015.  His reasons for so granting
    are:-

         "1.  In a Decision  promulgated  on  21  August  2015  Judge  Asjad
             dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
             decision to refuse  to  vary  his  leave  to  remain,  and  in
             consequence of her decision  to  remove  him  to  Pakistan  by
             reference to s47.

         2.   The application was made in time.

         3.   The Appellant was notified appropriately that the CAS  he  had
             submitted with his application was invalid as a result of  the
             subsequent loss of its licence by his sponsor.   The  '60  day
             policy' was properly applied by the Respondent so that he  was
             given on 12 January  2015  an  opportunity  to  make  a  fresh
             application based upon a new CAS.

         4.    The  Judge  appears  to  have  accepted  that  the  Appellant
             submitted a new valid CAS on 8 April  2015.   The  refusal  to
             vary leave of 11 May 2015 made no reference to that  new  CAS,
             and referred solely to the CAS  submitted  with  the  original
             application.  The Judge did not consider  whether  the  papers
             submitted on 8 April 2015 had been overlooked,  but  dismissed
             the appeal apparently on the sole basis that the 60 day period
             had already expired by that date.

         5.   Arguably the decision shows that the Judge  proceeded  on  the
             assumption that the Appellant's leave was 'curtailed' 60  days
             after  12  January  2015,  and  that  there  was  nothing  the
             Appellant could do, or say, thereafter [5].  This was  a  very
             brief decision made on the papers - it arguably  discloses  an
             error of  law  in  the  Judge's  approach  to  the  valid  CAS
             submitted on 8 April 2015, when the Respondent had  identified
             no other reason than the lack of a valid CAS for  her  refusal
             of his application on 11 May 2015."

 4. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 5. I was told that for the reasons  put  forward  within  the  appellant's
    grounds it was agreed that the valid CAS should have been considered by
    the judge and that this amounted to a  material  error  of  law.   Both
    parties urged me to remit this appeal back to the  Secretary  of  State
    for a lawful decision to be made.  I queried with them my powers so  to
    do as this is a decision dated 11 May 2015  and  accordingly  post  the
    amendments  made  by  the  Immigration  Act  2014  to  Part  5  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applicable on or  after  6
    April 2015.  However I was shown the transitional arrangements  to  the
    Immigration Act 2014 and both representatives urged me to  accept  that
    the proposed course was within my powers.  I agree  that  that  is  the
    position.



Decision

 6. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

 7. I set aside the decision.  I remake it by allowing the  appeal  to  the
    limited extent that it is referred back to the respondent for a  lawful
    decision to be made.

 8. No anonymity order is made.


Signed   Date 17 February 2016.
