For the Respondent:    Ms M Tanner, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Details of appellant and background

   1.       This is an appeal  against  a  deportation  order  made  by  the
      Secretary of State on 17 December 2010. It comes before me following a
      grant of permission by First-tier Tribunal Judge Froom on 20 July 2011
      and the finding,  on  the  papers,  that  there  were  errors  in  the
      Tribunal's assessment of the best interests of the appellant's  child.
      The latter decision was taken by Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman  on  18
      August 2011 following a concession by the Secretary of State.

   2.       No application for anonymity  has  been  made  however  I  have,
      nevertheless, referred to the appellant's child only as D and  to  his
      (the child's) mother and grandmother as RC and TC respectively.

   3.       The appellant is a citizen of Gambia born on 9 February 1973. He
      attempted to enter the UK as a visitor in  September  1995  but  after
      being refused leave to  enter  he  claimed  asylum.  That  appeal  was
      dismissed in his absence on 14 May 1998. Shortly afterwards,  however,
      he was granted leave to remain for  12  months  as  a  spouse  and  in
      September 1999 obtained indefinite leave to remain.  He  divorced  his
      wife on 6  April  2004  (C3;  respondent's  bundle)  and  was  refused
      naturalisation in November 2005 on the basis that  he  had  failed  to
      disclose that there were robbery charges pending against  him.  On  30
      June 2008 he applied for  his  ILR  to  be  endorsed  in  his  current
      passport but that was refused on 5 January 2011 because the  Secretary
      of State took the view that  the  deportation  order  invalidated  his
      existing leave.

   4.       In 2004 the appellant met RC, a British citizen, and they  began
      a relationship. On 22 February  2009  a  son,  D,  was  born  to  them
      although by  that  stage  the  relationship  had  already  ended.  The
      appellant's witness statement of 1 March 2011 (Bundle 2) in  which  he
      claims they are engaged and the statement of 9 October 2011 (Bundle 1)
      maintaining an ongoing relationship at that  stage  are  both  untrue.
      Records show that the relationship ended when R fell pregnant  (social
      worker's report and TC's statement).

   5.       On 16 June 2009 the appellant was convicted on three  counts  of
      Class C (x 2) and A (x 1) drugs offences and one count of possessing a
      prohibited weapon. He was sentenced to  a  total  of  5  years  and  3
      months. The offences took place on two separate  dates.  The  firearms
      offence and possession of a class C drug weapon occurred  on  28  June
      2007. The two other offences of possessing Class A and  C  drugs  with
      intent to supply occurred on 14 October 2008.  The  appellant  entered
      not guilty pleas to all the offences.

   6.       The remarks  of  the  sentencing  judge  are  contained  in  the
      respondent's bundle. The appellant was found to be  "an  opportunistic
      drug dealer, operating at a mid level of dealing with an  arrangement,
      clearly, in the drug community that customers  could  attend  at  your
      premises at any time, day or night, to obtain their supplies from you.
      The level of your involvement is indicated by the figures produced  in
      the trial and also in the  confiscation  proceedings.  That  a  street
      value which I acknowledge is the ultimate value, you were  dealing  in
      no less than ï¿½15,000 worth of Class C and Class A".  The  judge  found
      that "following your arrest  you  were  bailed  but  continued  to  be
      available to trade as before...It  beggars  belief  that  having  been
      arrested, as you were and then being bailed, you had no hesitation  in
      continuing to be involved in the drug trade".

   7.       The appellant was  released  on  licence  on  2  June  2011  but
      remained in immigration detention until 16 December 2011 when  he  was
      granted bail which currently appears to be under the authority of  the
      Immigration Service. The terms of his licence continue  until  January
      2014.

   8.       RC has a history of 13 theft and kindred offences,  15  offences
      relating to police/courts/ prisons, one drug offence and  one  firearm
      offence. She has a total of 13 convictions for 30 offences. As far  as
      I can see, her last conviction was on 12 November 2010 and  the  first
      was in 2004. She also has three  warnings/cautions  between  1999  and
      2003. At the date of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  she  was  in
      prison. She was released in June 2012, a year earlier than  scheduled,
      now lives in a hostel and has regular contact with her son.

   9.       On 17 December 2010 the Secretary of State  made  a  deportation
      order under section 32(5)  of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007.  This  was
      accompanied by a letter dated 5 January 2011. For  reasons  which  are
      not clear, the Secretary of  State  then  withdrew  that  letter,  and
      issued another on 3 March 2011. The deportation order of December 2010
      has not been revoked and remains the only order before me.

Appeal hearing

  10.       The appeal first came before me  on  9  October  2012.  On  that
      occasion, the appellant attended with his two sureties and  gave  oral
      evidence. He spoke in English. He confirmed  his  date  of  birth  and
      address and adopted the witness statements contained in Bundles 1  and
      2 as part of his evidence. He confirmed the  contents  were  true  and
      accurate. He also confirmed that TC, the maternal grandmother  of  his
      child, still supported his appeal.

  11.       The appellant was asked for an update  on  the  application  for
      guardianship made by TC in respect of the appellant's son.  He  stated
      that the proceedings had been adjourned until 4 December 2012.  He did
      not have  a  notice  of  hearing  with  him.  He  said  that  his  own
      application for contact and parental responsibility were to  be  heard
      at the same time. He was asked whether TC opposed his application.  He
      said that she recently told him that she opposed it because she wanted
      to make sure he did not fall back into his bad ways. He said  that  he
      used to visit his son three or four times a week but since he  started
      work he visited him on Saturdays only.

  12.       The appellant confirmed that RC was now out of prison  and  that
      she visited their son every Tuesday at her mother's house.

  13.        The  appellant  stated  that  his  contact  with  his  son  was
      supervised in the sense that TC was present. There was no  supervision
      by social services. The appellant was asked why it  would  be  in  his
      son's best interests for him to stay in  the  UK.  He  stated  it  was
      because he loved his son and his son loved  him.  He  said  the  child
      cried when it was time for him to leave in  the  evenings  because  he
      wanted him to stay and play. He confirmed he was still on licence  and
      he had a probation officer whom he visited once a month. He  said  his
      solicitors had asked the probation officer to prepare a report and  he
      did not know whether this had been done.

  14.       The appellant was asked how his removal to Gambia  would  affect
      contact with his son. He stated that he normally took his son  out  on
      Sundays (although I note this contradicts his earlier evidence that he
      saw him on Saturdays) and they went bowling or ice  skating.  It  also
      contradicts the evidence that visits were supervised at TC's house. If
      he were to be removed to Gambia he would not be able to do this.  That
      completed examination in chief.

  15.       In cross-examination, the appellant confirmed that TC had  three
      sons and one daughter. Two of the sons were married and lived some  10
      minutes away from their mother's house whilst the other son, CC, lived
      with his girlfriend in TC's house. They  all  played  a  role  in  the
      child's life and took him out. The rest of  the  family  also  visited
      regularly.

  16.       The appellant stated that his son went to nursery but  he  could
      not recall the name of the nursery. He could not remember the name  of
      the road either but he said it was about  10  minutes  walk  from  the
      house. He had been there four or five times accompanying TC.  His  son
      started at nursery last year aged two when the appellant was still  in
      prison and attended Mondays through to  Thursdays  from  midday  until
      three o'clock. When he was older, he would attend a local school.

  17.       The appellant was asked about TC's objections to his application
      for contact. He replied that he got on well with her and she  did  not
      oppose his contact with the child but always  wanted  somebody  to  be
      with him and the child. The appellant stated that his wish was for his
      son to eventually live with him but  for  the  time  being  he  wanted
      parental responsibility which would give  him  legal  rights  to  make
      decisions about his son.

  18.       The appellant  agreed  that  his  name  was  not  on  the  birth
      certificate and explained this was because he had been in custody when
      the birth had been registered and that he now  had  to  apply  to  the
      court for his name to be added to the  certificate.  This  matter  was
      also going  to  be  dealt  with  in  December  along  with  the  other
      proceedings; no further information on this matter has  been  provided
      to date. He said that  the  hearing  in  the  Family  Court  had  been
      adjourned some months ago to await a social worker's  report.  He  did
      not have a copy of that report with him but he did have it at home.

  19.       The appellant stated that RC was not a stable person as she  was
      recovering from her addiction. As far as he was  aware,  she  did  not
      want their child to live with her.

  20.       The appellant stated that he was  notified  of  today's  hearing
      last week by his solicitors. He was asked whether he had spoken to  RC
      or TC about coming along to give evidence. He said that  his  son  had
      chickenpox and so had to stay at home with TC. With regard to the lack
      of updated statements from them, he  explained  that  he  thought  the
      letters they had already written were sufficient.

  21.       The appellant  stated  that  he  had  been  supporting  his  son
      financially ever since his birth. Whilst he  was  in  prison  he  made
      arrangements for money he earned to be sent to TC for the child. These
      were sums between ï¿½60 and ï¿½100.

  22.       The appellant stated that his  last  employment  had  been  with
      Royal Mail although he had no evidence of that.  However  one  of  his
      sureties had worked there with him. He had been employed between  2005
      and 2007. Prior to that he had worked as a cleaner at Heathrow and  he
      also worked at Honda in Langley and at Priory School. He had a private
      pension scheme with Royal Mail. It  had  been  difficult  for  him  to
      produce evidence of his employment because he had been in  prison  but
      he gave his national insurance number to the  immigration  authorities
      so they could check his tax contributions. He confirmed that  his  son
      had been born on 22 February. That completed cross-examination.

  23.       In re-examination the  appellant  was  asked  again  about  TC's
      opposition to his application for a court order. He conceded that  she
      had opposed the application but he said he did not know  if  that  was
      still the position. He confirmed that his contact  with  his  son  was
      unsupervised, but that was always the case  and  when  asked  for  the
      duration of his visits he said that the week before last it  had  been
      unsupervised for some four hours. His visits were  always  during  the
      daytime. That completed re-examination.

  24.       In response to my questions, the appellant stated that CC was 23
      or 24 years old. He worked as a forklift truck driver on  a  full-time
      basis. His girlfriend worked full-time in a  nursery.  TC  worked  two
      nights a week as an operator for a taxi company. TC took the child  to
      nursery and collected him.  I  asked  the  appellant  to  explain  the
      contradiction in the evidence he had just given Mr Palmer and what  he
      had said earlier regarding supervised  contact.  He  stated  that  the
      situation had gradually developed and since he had come out of  prison
      he had built a better relationship with  TC.  I  asked  him  what  had
      brought about RC's change of heart with  respect  to  his  involvement
      with their child. He said that she had seen how much the child enjoyed
      being with him and she was now concerned that his best interests  were
      met. Neither party had any questions arising from mine. There was then
      a short break for us to consider the social worker's  report  of  June
      2012 (Report B) which had just been submitted. On resuming, Ms  Tanner
      had no questions to ask. Mr Palmer asked the appellant to clarify  the
      situation regarding his contact with his child as all  the  references
      in the report were  to  supervised  contact  at  least  up  until  the
      preparation of the report in June. The appellant maintained,  however,
      that he had always been allowed to take his son to the park on his own
      even before June 2012.

  25.       I asked the appellant how I could reconcile  his  oral  evidence
      with the evidence in the report which suggested that both  TC  and  RC
      opposed his application for unsupervised contact. He replied that  his
      solicitors had tried to ascertain the reasons for the  opposition  and
      he had been told that there were none. He denied that he had  put  any
      pressure on them to write letters in support of his appeal.

  26.       At this stage after some discussion it was agreed  that  further
      evidence would be required specifically from  his  probation  officer,
      updated information from the  social  worker,  the  OASys  report  and
      evidence of identification from TC and RC to link to their handwritten
      letters. It was also considered desirable to adjourn the hearing until
      after the hearing of the family Court on 4  December.  A  date  of  11
      December was agreed.

  27.       Regrettably for reasons not clear to me,  the  hearing  was  not
      listed as had been agreed and it resumed on 11 January  2013  instead.
      Prior  to  the  hearing  I  received  two  bundles  of  documents.  It
      transpired at the hearing that one of those  bundles  (containing  the
      social worker's report -  Report  A,  correspondence  between  TC  and
      social services and a statement from TC) had not been  served  by  the
      appellant's solicitors and that Mr Palmer, and indeed Mrs Tanner,  had
      not seen copies. I can only surmise that the documents  emanated  from
      TC or someone acting on her behalf given their contents.  Copies  were
      made for the parties. Mr Palmer sought  an  adjournment  not  just  to
      consider the documents but because the proceedings in the Family Court
      had been adjourned until 24 January with a further hearing  some  time
      in February. He undertook to forward documentary confirmation of same.
      Mrs Tanner did  not  object  to  the  application  which  I  therefore
      granted.

  28.       The matter then resumed on 6 June 2013 having been adjourned  at
      the appellant's request from the hearing on 17 April. On 31 May copies
      of a contact order dated 22 May 2013 from Slough County  Court  and  a
      letter dated 4 March 2013 from the Probation Services were  served  on
      the Tribunal. At the resumption of  the  hearing  it  transpired  that
      Counsel had additional  documentary  evidence  which  the  appellant's
      solicitors had failed to serve  either  on  the  Tribunal  or  on  the
      respondent. Copies had to be made. At the conclusion of the hearing  I
      received a letter from the appellant's  representatives  forwarding  a
      letter dated 20 March 2012 addressed to them from the UKBA  confirming
      that the appellant's leave remained valid until the conclusion of  his
      appeal hearing.

  29.       After seeking to clarify various matters,  I  heard  submissions
      from the parties.  Mr Palmer did not wish to call  any  oral  evidence
      from the appellant.

  30.       Ms Tanner relied upon the reasons for  deportation  letter.  She
      acknowledged that the main issue  was  proportionality  and  that  the
      interests of the  appellant's  child  were  a  primary  though  not  a
      paramount consideration. She submitted that now four years old, D  had
      lived with TC, his maternal grandmother, most of his life and had been
      provided with a stable and caring home. TC's son, CC, his partner  and
      their new baby, also resided there. The three reports from the  social
      worker spoke in glowing terms of TC's diligence and care and concluded
      that all the child's needs were met. He was still very young  and  had
      not  formed  anything  more  than  a  limited  relationship  with  the
      appellant. Regardless of the contact  between  them,  deportation  was
      proportionate given the appellant's actions  and  conduct.  Ms  Tanner
      relied upon AD Lee [2011] EWCA Civ 348 and ZH (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC
      4. She submitted that family life would be disrupted  because  of  the
      appellant's bad behaviour and that was the reality of deportation. The
      appellant was a repeat offender and a  drug  dealer  and  the  UK  was
      entitled to rid itself of him. It was all very  well  to  be  contrite
      once the deportation order had been signed but this was a man who  had
      continued to push drugs  even  when  on  bail.  Factors  such  as  the
      revulsion of society at his crimes and the deterrent factor outweighed
      family life as per N (Kenya [2004] EWCA Civ 104. Had  the  child  been
      older or had he not had other stable family members in his  life,  the
      respondent's submissions might be different but in  the  circumstances
      of this case where the child's parents had both been involved in drugs
      and where he had found a loving and stable home with his  grandmother,
      the appellant's deportation was proportionate.

  31.       Mr Palmer accepted that the  appellant's  convictions  were  for
      serious offences but submitted that his low risk  of  reoffending  and
      the low risk he posed to the public were relevant considerations  when
      proportionality was assessed. There was up to  date  information  from
      the Probation Services in lieu of an OASys report. The  appellant  had
      had lawful leave to remain and had worked lawfully.  He  had  been  of
      good character for many years. He had also been in a relationship with
      RC and had done his best to be a good father to their child. Whilst in
      prison the appellant had behaved  well  and  achieved  qualifications.
      Prison officers had written references for  him.  He  had  engaged  in
      training services and obtained a fork-lift truck licence.  He  had  an
      offer for employment and he had worked lawfully previously. The family
      court had made an order for parental responsibility and contact  which
      it did having decided that was in the best interests of the child.  As
      the order was made by consent, TC must have agreed to it  despite  her
      prior reservations. The appellant's circumstances differed from  those
      of Lee. The public interest was not  served  by  his  deportation.  Mr
      Palmer also relied on Sanade (British children -  Zambrano  -  Dereci)
      [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC) and Mohan [2012] EWCA Civ 1363 and argued that
      deportation would be disproportionate given the strong factors in  the
      appellant's favour.

  32.       At the conclusion of the hearing  I  reserved  my  determination
      which I now give.

The Law


  33.       The deportation order was made on 17 December 2010 and served on
      3 March 2011. As it was made prior to 9 July  2012  when  HC  194  was
      introduced, it falls to be considered under the old Immigration Rules.
      Neither party argued otherwise.

  34.       There is no dispute over the fact that the appellant  is  liable
      to deportation under section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007.  No  claim
      for asylum has been put  forward  to  challenge  deportation  and  the
      submissions  focused  solely  on  Article  8(2)  and  the   issue   of
      proportionality,  the  question  being  whether  the  removal  of  the
      appellant,  notwithstanding  its  effect  on  him   and   others,   is
      proportionate to the legitimate purposes of  immigration  control  and
      prevention of crime.

  35.       There is little dispute over the facts of the case, although the
      respondent believes that the appellant is using his son to  strengthen
      his appeal  against  deportation.  The  Tribunal  must  undertake  the
      proportionality balancing exercise  and  decide  whether  more  weight
      should be given to the  public  interest  or  to  the  rights  of  the
      appellant and his son.

  36.       It is established  case  law  that  there  is  a  strong  public
      interest in removing foreign citizens convicted of  serious  offences,
      which lies not only in the prevention of further offences on the  part
      of the individual concerned, but in deterring others  from  committing
      them in the first place, promoting public confidence in the  treatment
      of foreign  citizens  who  have  committed  them  and  serving  as  an
      expression of society's  condemnation  of  criminal  activity.   In  N
      (Kenya) [2004] EWCA Civ 104, Judge LJ, as he then was,  said  this  on
      the public interest aspect in the balancing exercise:

      ..."public good"  and  the  "public  interest"  are  wide-ranging  but
      undefined concepts. In my judgment (whether expressly referred  to  in
      any decision letter or not) broad issues of social cohesion and public
      confidence in the administration of the system  by  which  control  is
      exercised over non-British citizens who enter and remain in the United
      Kingdom are engaged. They include an element of  deterrence,  to  non-
      British citizens who are  already  here,  even  if  they  are  genuine
      refugees and to those minded to  come,  so  as  to  ensure  that  they
      clearly understand  that,  whatever  the  circumstances,  one  of  the
      consequences of serious crime may well  be  deportation"(at  paragraph
      83).


  37.       The remarks in judgments such  as  N  (Kenya)  and  OH  (Serbia)
      [2008] EWCA Civ 694 on the weight to be given  to  the  views  of  the
      Secretary  of  State  were  overtaken  by  the  introduction  of   the
      provisions on deportation by way of the UK  Borders  Act  2007,  which
      made deportation compulsory for foreign nationals over the age  of  17
      sentenced to more than 12 months in prison except where removal  would
      breach the ECHR or the Refugee  Convention.   As  pointed  out  in  MK
      (deportation - foreign criminal - public interest) Gambia [2010]  UKUT
      281 (IAC):

      "The seriousness of an offence and the public interest are factors  of
      considerable importance when carrying out the  balancing  exercise  in
      article 8. As Parliament has now determined where the public  interest
      lies in cases of automatic deportation, that factor must be taken into
      account together with the Tribunal's own assessment of the seriousness
      of the offence."

  38.       It is possible in a case of sufficiently serious offending  that
      the factors in favour of deportation will be strong enough  to  render
      deportation proportionate even if it does have the effect of  severing
      established family relationships (JO  (Uganda)  [2010]  EWCA  Civ  10,
      paragraphs 24 and 27) and AD Lee [2011] EWCA Civ 348.

  39.       Strasbourg jurisprudence contains guidance on the matter of  the
      expulsion of long term immigrants. Much of this focuses on  those  who
      have spent their formative years in a member state where the following
      factors are considered relevant when assessing proportionality:

         . The personal behaviour of the appellant
         . The duration of residence
         . The consequences for the appellant and his family
         . Existing links with the country of origin
         . The time  elapsed  since  the  offence  was  committed  and  the
           appellant's conduct during this period
         . Ties with the host country
         . The person's age at the time the offences were committed

  40.       Where a child is involved, that child's  best  interests  are  a
      primary consideration following section 55 and I accept that. In  this
      case, the main, if not the only, thrust of the Article 8 claim is  the
      appellant's family life with his son, D. In Sanade, relied upon by  Mr
      Palmer, the Upper Tribunal summarised the  following  as  relevant  to
      deportation cases:

          a.   Article 8 is to be interpreted in a  manner  consistent  with
             Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the  Child  and
             the statutory duty to  have  regard  to  guidance  designed  to
             promote the best interests or welfare of the child set  out  in
             s.55 the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.
          b. The welfare of the child is  a  primary  but  not  a  paramount
             consideration in immigration decision making. That is to say it
             is a consideration of the first order and not merely a  factor,
             but not the only consideration or necessarily  a  determinative
             consideration.
          c.     The  welfare  principle   applies   irrespective   of   the
             nationality of the child, but where the child is  British  that
             is a particular pointer to the place where the  child's  future
             lies.  British  nationality  imposed  a  significantly   higher
             threshold when a decision-maker was considering whether a child
             should be expected to join a parent abroad.
          d. Factors that may  outweigh  the  welfare  of  the  child  in  a
             particular case are rights based considerations such  as  those
             contained in Article 8 (2)  in  particular  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime or the protection of the health and rights of
             others.
          e.    Weighty reasons are required to justify separating a  family
             who are legitimately resident together in the United Kingdom.
          f.    Even where it is not reasonable to expect the other  partner
             to a relationship or  the  children  to  accompany  the  person
             subject to immigration action to reside abroad the interference
             with family life may be justified.
          g. Notwithstanding the distress caused to a child and the loss  of
             advantage to the child of (in these cases) a father's  presence
             guidance  and  support,  the  conduct   of  the  person  facing
             deportation may be so contrary to the  public  interest  as  to
             make such separation proportionate and justified.


  41.       Mohan [2012] EWCA Civ 1362: court acknowledged the importance of
      evidence from the family court  and  cited  Nimako-Boateng  (residence
      orders - Anton considered) 2012 UKUT 00218 (IAC) which held  that  the
      family court was best placed to evaluate the interests of  the  child.
      But also pointed out  that  whereas  in  family  law  proceedings  the
      welfare of the child is the paramount  consideration,  in  immigration
      proceedings it is  a  primary  rather  than  paramount  consideration.
      Bearing all of the above in mind, I now proceed with my assessment.



Findings and conclusions

  42.       I have carefully considered the  evidence  and  the  submissions
      made. In accordance with the guidance from the courts and section  55,
      I begin with an assessment of the best interests of D who is  affected
      by the proposed deportation of his father.  The  respondent  initially
      disputed paternity but that is no  longer  the  case  and  indeed  DNA
      evidence has  been  provided  to  confirm  the  claimed  relationship.
      Although the report points out that no ID document  was  received  for
      the father, he was in prison at the time and his saliva sample appears
      to have been taken by a prison officer.  D is now four years  old.  He
      was born when the appellant was in prison and was just  short  of  two
      years when the  appellant  was  released  from  prison  and  commenced
      supervised  contact  with  him.  When  his  mother  was  arrested  and
      imprisoned in February 2009, D was moved into the care of his maternal
      grandmother, TC. He has remained with her since, apart  from  a  brief
      period between January and early April 2010, when his mother  was  out
      of prison and offered separate accommodation.

  43.       The appellant has maintained, and this  is  confirmed  by  other
      evidence before me, that since his release in December  2011,  he  has
      seen his son regularly and has attempted to build a relationship  with
      him. There are, however, contradictions  in  the  evidence  about  the
      frequency and nature of the contact. Giving oral testimony in  October
      2012, the appellant stated that he saw his son 3-4 times a  week,  but
      then later said he saw him weekly on Saturdays; this was then  changed
      to Sunday visits. He also gave conflicting evidence as to whether  the
      contact was supervised or unsupervised. He was unable to  explain  why
      he maintained he had unsupervised contact  when  the  social  worker's
      report  indicated  that  the  only  contact  he  was   permitted   was
      supervised. Regrettably, there is no up to date  evidence  in  respect
      from either RC or TC and neither attended any of the  hearings  before
      the Upper Tribunal. Nevertheless, on the evidence before me,  I accept
      there has been contact since the appellant's release in December  2011
      although I am unable to make  any  finding  as  to  the  frequency  of
      contact due to the conflicting evidence. I find that  the  appellant's
      contact has always been supervised. I prefer  the  evidence  from  the
      social worker in her three reports (and confirmed by C) to this effect
      rather than the appellant's oral  evidence  which  in  any  event  was
      contradictory about the nature of the contact.

  44.       I accept that there is family life between the appellant and  D.
      That is not disputed by Ms Tanner and the parties both focused on  the
      issue of proportionality when making their submissions. I also  accept
      that the appellant has genuine affection for his son. It may  be  that
      he is well aware that his son is the strongest element of  his  appeal
      but that does not, in my view,  detract  from  his  feelings  for  the
      child. With regard to the proceedings in the family court, I find that
      these were prompted by TC's application  for  a  Special  Guardianship
      Order rather than exclusively by the deportation proceedings.

  45.       In assessing where the child's best interests lie, I  adopt  the
      premise that it is usually the case that a child is better off  having
      both parents to care for him/her. Of course that  is  not  always  the
      case. However, the severance of the bond between a child and a  parent
      is not something that can be undertaken lightly.

  46.       This case does not follow the usual pattern of  a  child  living
      with one or both parents and where one or both  face  deportation.  In
      this case, the child lives with his maternal grandmother and has  done
      for the overwhelming majority of his short life. Both his parents have
      spent long periods in  prison  and  indeed  the  appellant's  physical
      absence from D's life has been longer than his presence in  it.   Both
      parents have been involved in drugs; RC as an addict and the appellant
      at least as a dealer, if not a user too. The social services placed  D
      on the Child Protection Register even before his birth and have always
      supported the living arrangements with TC. There appear to  have  been
      serious concerns voiced by TC, less so by RC and also to  some  extent
      by the social services but I am cognisant of  the  recent  order  from
      Slough County Court  which,  although  giving  TC  a  SGO,  gives  the
      appellant parental responsibility and limited weekly  contact  rights,
      gradually increasing in duration and to be reviewed in December.  That
      order, granted by  consent  as  Mr  Palmer  emphasised,  is  of  great
      importance to my assessment.

  47.       It is fair to say that the evidence before  me  shows  that  the
      relationship between TC and the appellant with regards to D  has  been
      somewhat rocky. In her statements of 20 February 2011 and 13  February
      2012 TC supports the appellant's attempts to remain here  and  to  see
      his son. However her statement to  the  Tribunal  and  the  respondent
      dated 5 December 2012 (which was copied to Counsel and the  Presenting
      Officer at the January hearing)  shows  a  complete  about  turn.  She
      maintains that due to the appellant's continuing criminal  activities,
      the appellant is no longer allowed to visit her property and meets his
      son at a supervised centre. She has also adduced evidence in the  form
      of correspondence  between  herself,  the  social  worker  and  Slough
      council with regard to having her front door changed  for  a  stronger
      one due to fears about the appellant and his cohorts. TC states in her
      December statement that she had a panic alarm installed  in  her  home
      and that she had passed on to the police a recording of the  appellant
      being  involved  in  criminal  activities.  She  maintains  that   the
      appellant has not changed his lifestyle and that D was at risk.

  48.       I also have four hand written letters  from  RC.  The  first  is
      dated 1 June 2011. It confirms that she and  the  appellant  have  not
      been in a relationship for the  previous  three  years,  that  she  is
      content for the appellant to have supervised visits to see  their  son
      but that she objects to the child ever living with him.  On  2  August
      2012 she  wrote  to  support  the  appellant's  attempts  to  build  a
      relationship with the child and confirmed they have a strong bond. The
      third letter is undated and  was  sent  from  HMP  Woking.  In  it  RC
      maintains that she has been in a relationship with the  appellant  for
      seven years and supports his appeal against deportation.  Plainly  she
      is wrong about the duration of the relationship; seven years does  not
      accord with the evidence that they met in 2004  and  parted  when  she
      fell pregnant in 2008. The fourth letter is dated 23 November 2012 and
      also supports the appellant's appeal.

  49.       Further information is provided by the  social  worker,  Dorothy
      Sessanga. I have three reports from her (although two are co-signed by
      others). All reports purport to have been prepared for the hearing  on
      6 August 2012 presumably before the Family Court even though at  least
      one was signed after that date. The reports differ in certain respects
      and I have labelled them as A, B and C. At  the  commencement  of  the
      June hearing I attempted to clarify which report(s)  had  been  before
      District Judge Parker at Slough  Country  Court,  but  Mr  Palmer  was
      unable to assist. It appears that they were prepared both  in  respect
      of the appellant's application for parental  responsibility  and  TC's
      application for a Special Guardianship Order.

  50.       Report A is signed by Ms Sessanga but is undated. It  was  faxed
      to the Tribunal on 6 December 2012 along with TC's statement and other
      correspondence and copies were made  for  the  parties  of  all  those
      documents at the January hearing (see  paragraph  27  above).   It  is
      prepared under section 7 of  the  Children's  Act  1989  for  case  SL
      12P00199 (which I note is the reference for the proceedings in  Slough
      County Court). We are told that Ms Sessanga  has  been  the  allocated
      social worker since 23 February 2012, that she has met  the  appellant
      twice, met RC once and met TC and D four times.  They  have  also  had
      telephone contact. Ms Sessanga has also had access to the  records  of
      Social Care, the Probation Service and the previous social worker.  At
      the time the report was prepared, presumably in the period between  23
      February and 6 August 2012, the appellant had supervised contact  with
      the child who had been made the subject of  a  Child  Protection  Plan
      before his birth due to his mother's dependence on  heroin,  methadone
      and morphine. It is reported that  whilst  in  prison,  the  appellant
      completed a short programme on substance  misuse,  provided  mandatory
      and voluntary  drug  tests  with  negative  results  but  received  an
      adjudication on 27 January 2011 for receiving  wraps  of  cannabis  to
      which he pleaded guilty. Since his release he has been compliant  with
      licence conditions and attended parenting classes.

  51.       Significantly, the report states that neither RC nor TC  support
      the appellant's application for contact  and  parental  responsibility
      because they were concerned about his ability to provide adequate care
      in view of  his  past  involvement  with  drug  dealing  and  to  make
      decisions in D's best interests. Additionally, RC was  concerned  that
      the appellant was seeking parental  responsibility  as  a  gateway  to
      securing his own immigration status. TC was concerned at the appellant
      having unsupervised contact  and  the  risk  of  D  being  exposed  to
      inappropriate company.

  52.       Ms Sessanga takes D's feelings into account, as much as  can  be
      done for such a young child. She confirms she has spoken to him  twice
      and during both  meetings  "he  had  difficulty  in  articulating  his
      feelings about his father or talking about his  current  contact  with
      him".

  53.       Ms Sessanga warns against rushing the relationship  between  the
      appellant and D so as not to cause him confusion but observes that the
      appellant had shown  limited  insight  into  potential  tensions.  She
      notes, however, that there appeared to be a good relationship  between
      them.

  54.       She concludes that the local authority supports the making of  a
      Special Guardianship Order in respect of TC. She states that the local
      authority  has  concerns  that  if  granted  parental  respondent  the
      appellant may seek to take D out of the country and not return him  to
      TC's care and therefore recommends supervised contact until TC decides
      this can change and overriding parental responsibility to remain  with
      her.

  55.       I note that the report wrongly states at paragraph 5.2 that  the
      appellant was sentenced to three years in prison; in  fact  his  total
      sentence was 5 years and 3 months which is correctly stated  at  4.11.
      The report states that the Home Office confirmed  that  the  appellant
      had ILR and would retain that status unless he loses  his  deportation
      appeal (4.11). This is legally incorrect and I shall  deal  with  this
      later.

  56.       Report B is signed by Ms Sessanga on 12 June  2012  and  by  two
      other social workers from different departments on 28 January 2011. It
      begins with the same history as is set out in A. It twice repeats  the
      misinformation that the appellant received a three year  sentence  (at
      4.2 and Part 2(i)); this should be 5 years and  3  months.  It  states
      that the appellant was released in June 2011 (Part 2(i) and  (j  iv));
      in fact he was not as  he  remained  in  immigration  detention  until
      December 2011. The report repeats the opposition of TC and RC  to  the
      appellant's application for contact and  parental  responsibility  (at
      5.3) and the concerns that he is placing his own needs above those  of
      the child and applying only to  secure  his  own  status  here  (5.4).
      Positive references are made about the care provided  by  TC  and  the
      stability she has given the child. The same warnings about not rushing
      into making changes are  set  out  as  is  the  child's  inability  to
      articulate his feelings about his father.  The  report  confirms  that
      there  are  no  concerns  about  the  care  provided  by  TC  who  has
      demonstrated that she is able to promote D's welfare and has his  best
      interests in mind.  The same recommendations are  set  out  as  above.
      Several references from friends/neighbours of TC are attached.

  57.       The report contains a note at Part 3 about religious upbringing.
      It is recorded that RC wants D to be raised as a Christian whereas the
      appellant wants him to be circumcised. RC opposes circumcision.

  58.       The pages between Part 4(h) - 4(q) are missing from the  report.
      They could not be made available to me at the hearing.

  59.       I can see no reference to deportation in  this  report;  only  a
      reference to the appellant having ILR.

  60.       Rather perplexingly, Report C is signed by Ms Sessanga  and  the
      Assistant Team Manager on 28 August  2012  and  by  two  other  social
      workers on 28 January 2011. In these circumstances, it is unclear when
      the report was actually prepared. It contains information not set  out
      in either of the two other reports. I am not  clear  why  this  is  or
      whether Judge Parker had this report or one of the other less detailed
      reports  before  him  when  he  considered  the  applications  of  the
      appellant and TC.

  61.       This report sets out the sentence correctly at 2(d) but  wrongly
      at 2(i) and refers to the deportation order but again  misstates  that
      the appellant will continue to have ILR unless he  loses  his  appeal.
      The report states that the appellant has  been  employed  as  a  lorry
      driver five days a week from June 2012.

  62.       It is reported that during a home visit to the appellant  on  22
      August  2012,  he  stated  that  he  no  longer  supported  TC's   SGO
      application. He objected to the control TC had imposed on him (3 b i).
       The conflict between the appellant's wish to have D  circumcised  and
      RC's objection to it is recorded (3 b ii and  4aa)  and  RC  has  also
      voiced concerns about the appellant continuing  to  deal  in  Class  C
      drugs (3 b iii). There is also a lengthy record of a conflict  between
      the appellant and TC about contact (ibid).

  63.        The  same  concerns  about  the  appellant's  application   for
      unsupervised contact are expressed  by  TC  (4w,  4aa  and  4bb).  The
      recommendation in conclusion is that contact remains supervised by  TC
      until she feels it is safe and that frequency of contact should be  at
      her discretion.

  64.       Despite the reservations expressed by TC and RC and despite  the
      recommendation of Slough Social  Services,  it  appears  that  at  the
      hearing at Slough Country Court on 22 May 2013, an order  was  granted
      by  consent.  This  gave  Special  Guardianship  to  TC  and  parental
      responsibility to the appellant with contact to take place on a weekly
      basis  beginning  with  two  hour  visits  at  a  contact  centre  and
      progressing to longer periods at different venues to  be  reviewed  in
      December. I have not been  made  aware  of  the  documentary  evidence
      placed before the court.

  65.       I take note of the evidence of the appellant, as given  in  oral
      testimony and as contained in his witness statements. In his statement
      of 1 March 2011 he maintains that he and RC are engaged  and  plan  to
      marry as soon as they are released from prison. He adds that they keep
      in touch via letters and write and talk about their future  and  their
      son's future with them as a family (paragraph 3). He  states  that  he
      regrets his past wrong doing, that he just wants to live with  RC  and
      their son, that this was  his  first  offence  and  he  had  no  other
      convictions.  In his statement of 16 March  2011  he  states  that  he
      works in prison and spends his earnings on calling RC  and  their  son
      and on supporting the child. He confirms  that  TC  had  agreed  to  D
      moving in with him once he was released from prison. The evidence from
      TC and the social worker does not, however, accord with this claim. In
      the 9 October 2011 statement he repeats  the  contents  of  the  first
      statement and confirms that upon release he wants his  child  to  live
      with him. He appears to have given up the idea of a relationship  with
      RC; instead he maintains she continues to be dependent upon drugs  and
      that he is the only parent able to look after D. In the 9 October 2012
      statement he maintains that he has been visiting D every day since his
      release, spends most of the day with  him  and  takes  him  to  parks,
      shopping and restaurants. However, even by his own oral evidence, this
      is plainly untrue. He confirms he has instructed solicitors  to  apply
      for a parental responsibility order on  his  behalf.  He  states  that
      whilst in prison he has been good and has abided by the law.

  66.       I have a two page fax described as photographs of the  appellant
      and D. They are of very poor quality and without  the  originals  they
      are of little use as I cannot clearly make out what they depict.

  67.       I referred earlier to the incorrect reference in at least two of
      the social worker's reports to the  appellant's  indefinite  leave  to
      remain. Although the appellant was, in no uncertain terms, told in the
      reasons for deportation order that his existing leave was  invalidated
      by the deportation order, I do not blame him for his  belief  that  he
      still had  ILR.  This  is  due  wholly  to  the  confused  information
      emanating from the Secretary of State. On the one hand, as I have just
      said, the reasons for  deportation  letter  clearly  states  that  the
      deportation order  invalidates  the  appellant's  existing  leave  (at
      paragraph 9), and a letter of 25 April 2012 from  the  UKBA,  Criminal
      Casework Directorate (CCD)  states  that  the  appellant  "should  not
      benefit from any grant of leave" due to his serious criminal  conduct.
      However I have also been  given  a  letter  sent  to  the  appellant's
      solicitors on 20 March 2012 from the CCD of the UKBA which states that
      "Until your client's appeal is concluded, his ILR is still  valid  and
      consequently there are no restrictions on his taking employment in the
      UK".
  68.       Despite the confused  message  sent  out  to  the  appellant  by
      officials at the UKBA, the position is made clear in  the  Immigration
      Rules (at paragraph 362) and the Immigration Act 1971;  a  deportation
      order has the effect of invalidating any existing leave  to  enter  or
      remain.  This was confirmed by Ms Tanner at the hearing.  Further,  it
      is confirmed by case law: for example, in the recent case  of  Fitzroy
      George [2012] EWCA Civ  1362.  The  appellant's  indefinite  leave  to
      remain therefore ceased to exist on 17 December 2010.

  69.       The result of this is that the District Judge, through no  fault
      of his own, was under the impression that the appellant had ILR.  This
      is plain from the directions from the court on 4 December  2012  which
      ordered the appellant to "promptly notify all other  parties  and  the
      Joint Legal Team if his indefinite leave to remain is revoked".  I  do
      not say that the outcome of the proceedings would have been  different
      had the judge been aware of the correct legal position, however it  is
      certainly possible that a different decision would have  been  reached
      had the appellant's loss of status been known.

  70.       I  take  note  of  the  letter  dated  4  March  2013  from  the
      appellant's Probation Officer. This confirms the appellant is  subject
      to licence conditions, that he has reported for all appointments,  has
      engaged with training services and has obtained a forklift licence.

  71.       Several references from prison officers have also been  adduced.
      Essentially they speak of the appellant in positive terms,  describing
      him as polite and helpful, determined  to  change  his  life  for  the
      better, cooperative and courteous. I am told he had enhanced  prisoner
      status, communicated well with prisoners and staff and made  good  use
      of resources.  The references prompted  a  letter  from  the  Regional
      Manager of Custodial Services dated 4 January 2011 to the  Immigration
      Team in Newcastle maintaining  that  prison  officers  should  not  be
      writing references and that the  matter  would  be  addressed.  As  Mr
      Palmer submitted, however, the letters form part of the evidence and I
      have taken note of them. I would say though, that I find it surprising
      that none of the  references  make  any  mention  of  the  appellant's
      adjudication of 27 January 2011 for receiving cannabis (referred to in
      Report A). I note that the appellant has not sought  to  dispute  this
      claim which is contained in evidence that he  has  himself  submitted.
      Had there been no such incident, I would have expected his legal  team
      to have made their challenge known to the Tribunal.

  72.       I have been referred to the Inland Revenue letter of 29  January
      2013 which purports to cover the appellant's  employment  in  the  UK.
      This shows periods of employment (via Remploy Ltd) for  the  tax  year
      2007 and 2008 and job seeker's allowance claimed between 28 July  2008
      and 5 April 2010. No other employment is recorded. His total  earnings
      as recorded by the Inland Revenue amount to under ï¿½32,000 between 2006-
      2012. There is no record of any earlier  employment.   Other  evidence
      provides additional, if conflicting, information. According to  Report
      C, the appellant has been employed as a lorry driver five days a  week
      from June 2012 but the letter from the Job Deal Case Manager at Milton
      Keynes College on 1 November 2012 states that the appellant  commenced
      employment in August 2012. The letter dated 16 July 2012  from  Purple
      Rose Ventures confirms employment commenced on 23 July 2012.  Two  pay
      slips for July  and  August  2012  have  been  submitted  from  Purple
      Ventures. They show payment in cash with no tax or national  insurance
      deductions with. Oddly, although the appellant only commenced work  on
      23 July, his pay slip for that month shows income  of  ï¿½460  which  is
      almost the same as a full month's work in August (ï¿½462.08).  There  is
      no PAYE reference for the employer on the July pay slip.   The  Inland
      Revenue letter also shows that the appellant had claimed job  seeker's
      allowance between 28 July 2008 and 5 April 2010. However as he was  in
      prison for at least a year of that period, it is unclear  how  he  was
      able to make this claim.

  73.       The appellant's representatives maintained on 24 March 2011  and
      23 May 2011  (in  respect  of  written  representations  for  the  CMR
      hearing) that the appellant was in a subsisting relationship  with  RC
      at that time. Plainly this was not the case as the  evidence  is  that
      the relationship ended when RC fell pregnant in 2008.

  74.       The appellant has made several visits back to Gambia.  According
      to the Secretary of State visits were made from 13 March 2001 until  1
      November 2002 (includes a visit to the USA), 30  February  2004  -  28
      March 2004, 7 October 2004 - 29 October 2004 and 4 November 2004 -  21
      January 2005. No evidence was called as to any earlier visits.

  75.       Having taken account of all this evidence I reach the  following
      conclusions with respect to proportionality. The best interests  of  D
      are to continue living with TC and  to  have  contact  with  both  his
      parents in a controlled manner. The appellant's  removal  will  impact
      upon D to some extent  and  may  well  have  the  effect  of  severely
      disrupting family life between them. As I  have  already  stated,  the
      severing of ties between a parent and child cannot  be  done  lightly.
      However having balanced the factors for and against deportation I have
      reached the conclusion that greater weight must be given to the public
      interest in the circumstances of this case.

  76.       On the  appellant's  side  I  have  factored  in  the  following
      positive points:
         . The presence of his child, a four year old British  citizen  and
           the involvement, albeit limited, he has in his life
         . That the best interests of that child  are  to  continue  living
           with TC and to have regular contact with the appellant  and  RC;
           he cannot be expected to accompany the appellant to Gambia
         . The order of Slough County Court giving the  appellant  parental
           responsibility and contact on a weekly basis (albeit that  order
           may have been made on  a  misunderstanding  of  the  appellant's
           legal status here)
         . The appellant's long residence here  with  indefinite  leave  to
           remain from September 1999 until December 2010
         . The appellant's employment for the tax  years  ending  2007  and
           2009
         . That the appellant has been compliant with the conditions of his
           licence and has attended all  appointments  with  the  Probation
           Service
         . That he has good references from prison officers
         . That he has  undertaken  training  since  his  release  and  has
           obtained a licence to operate a forklift truck
         . That he achieved various qualifications whilst in prison
         . That he has found some employment since his release (although  I
           am unclear whether this consisted of training and whether it  is
           ongoing)
         . That he was been assessed as having a low  risk  of  reoffending
           and is a low risk to the public.

  77.       Against the appellant are the following factors:
         . His criminal convictions  for  four  offences,  three  of  which
           involved drugs and one a prohibited weapon
         . The fact that contrary to what he claimed, this was  not  a  one
           off but that the convictions related to  offences  committed  at
           different times
         . That the appellant continued to deal drugs whilst on bail  after
           his arrest for the first offence
         . That he received a lengthy  prison  sentence  for  very  serious
           crimes
         . That he pleaded not guilty to those offences
         . That the third and fourth offences occurred just  a  few  months
           before his child was born and so at a time when he knew  he  was
           going to be a father and should have been acting responsibly
         . That the sentencing remarks show that he had  been  involved  in
           drug dealing for at least 15 months prior to his arrest
         . That he received an adjudication  of  receiving  cannabis  wraps
           when in prison (to which he pleaded guilty)
         . That he has sought to mislead the court by maintaining  that  he
           was in a subsisting relationship with RC in 2011 and  2012  even
           though the relationship ended in 2008
         . That contrary to what is claimed in his  witness  statement,  TC
           and RC have never been in favour of D living with the  appellant
           and there is no evidence they ever agreed to it upon his release


         . That for half of D's  life  the  appellant  was  in  prison  and
           contact was virtually non existent
         . That the UK should not have to put up with criminals such as the
           appellant
         . That society is entitled to express its condemnation of  foreign
           criminal activity
         . The importance of the deterrent factor
         . That the appellant's situation has been brought about by his own
           repeated misconduct
         . That he was an adult when he  committed  all  the  offences  for
           which he was convicted
         . That there is no evidence of the appellant's ties  with  the  UK
           other than through his son
         . That he maintains ties with Gambia as evidenced by  his  lengthy
           visits there
         . That he spent his formative years (and indeed  the  majority  of
           his life) there and came here as an adult
         . That his asylum claim appears to have been  unmeritorious  given
           that the appellant made regular visits home  after  having  lost
           the appeal but once he obtained ILR.

  78.       In  reaching  my  decision  that  the  public  interest  factors
      override the rights of the appellant and his son, I recognise that due
      weight is to be given to the order of the county court and to the view
      taken by the District Judge. However, it remains the case that  whilst
      the best interests of the child are paramount  in  the  family  court,
      they are a primary but not necessarily a  determinative  consideration
      in the immigration courts. D is still  very  young.  His  relationship
      with the appellant is in its infancy. He is  a  happy  child,  by  all
      accounts, and all his needs are catered for by TC (as confirmed by the
      social worker's reports). Notwithstanding the difficulties surrounding
      his birth and early life, he has been fortunate to find a  loving  and
      caring environment in which he has thrived. He is still very young and
      will, I find, adapt without undue distress to  his  father's  absence.
      It is still early days since the appellant's release and too  soon  to
      tell if he has genuinely changed his ways. Having been  under  intense
      scrutiny since his release due to his licence conditions,  the  family
      court proceedings and his deportation appeal, one would  expect  there
      to be no reoffending.   His deportation does not mean a permanent  end
      to family life. The appellant will have the opportunity to  apply  for
      revocation of the deportation order in due course.  By  then  he  will
      hopefully have shown that he has reformed.

  79.       I recognise that my decision will cause the  appellant  distress
      however having carefully  balanced  all  the  considerations  for  and
      against deportation, I have  reached  the  conclusion  that  the  very
      serious nature of the appellant's  offending  and  the  other  factors
      identified outweigh  his rights and those of his  son.  The  appellant
      must take responsibility for this as it is his  repeated  bad  conduct
      that has led to this situation and the break up  of  his  family  life
      with his young  son.  As  recognised  by  the  courts,  that  is  what
      deportation does; that is the reality of deportation.

Decision

  80.       The First-tier Tribunal was found to have made errors of law.  I
      now remake the decision and dismiss the appeal against the deportation
      order.
