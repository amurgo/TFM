Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Hussain, of Legal & Legal, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Saddiq, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born  on  18  March  1989.   He
    entered the UK as a student on 17 August 2012.  He married a UK citizen
    on 2 April 2014.  He applied on 17 October 2014 for  further  leave  to
    remain as a spouse.

 2. The respondent refused his application by letter dated 8 December 2014,
    because he and his wife did not provide documentary  evidence  in  line
    with Appendix FM-SA to meet the income requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules; paragraph EX.1 did not apply to his benefit; and  there  was  no
    basis for a grant of leave outside the Rules.

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  By the time of  the
    hearing on 16 April 2015, he and his wife had a child, aged 2 months.

 4. In her determination promulgated on 22 April  2015  Judge  J  C  Grant-
    Hutchison found that the requirements of Appendix FM-SA  had  not  been
    met (paragraph 14); that although there was now a  child,  it  was  not
    unreasonable to expect the child to leave the UK with his parents,  nor
    were there insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  outside
    the UK (paragraph 21);  that  looking  outside  the  Rules,  there  was
    nothing to be added in relation to the best  interests  of  the  child,
    which had already been considered at length, and so the appeal did  not
    succeed outside the Rules either (paragraphs 29-32).

 5. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal say at paragraph 3 that  in
    relation to the "true best interests of the child,  who  is  a  British
    citizen" he would have a "better and brighter future" in the UK, rather
    than in "an unknown and unsettled  environment",  and  that  the  judge
    failed to take into account  of  "the  implications  and  true  primary
    interests of the child."

 6. Paragraph 4 of the grounds says:

         "In paragraph 31 the judge incorrectly notes the appellant's wife's
         income being �18,662.40; the total combined and accumulated  income
         amounts to  �19,744.60.   Thus  if  the  appellant  was  to  return
         himself, this would possibly  mean  a  shortfall  in  the  required
         income.  Hence this could mean the appellant and his  family  could
         be parted for much longer than anticipated and thus clearly causing
         an insurmountable obstacle to continuing family life."

 7.  On  14  August  2015  a  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  granted
    permission, observing:

         "Although  the  earnings  would  meet  the  Rules   the   requisite
         documentation was not forthcoming ... it seems  arguable  ...  that
         the judge failed to appreciate that it was joint earnings  and  not
         just the sponsor ... if ... the appellant has to give  up  his  job
         and return, the family will be unable to meet the  Rules  on  joint
         earnings ..."

 8. Mr Hussain submitted that the judge erred as identified in the grant of
    permission.  He said that the appellant had shown  a  gross  income  of
    �9,872.85, and his wife a similar  amount.   Together,  their  earnings
    took them above the income threshold of �18,600.  The judge  failed  to
    appreciate that both required to be earning for them to meet the  Rules
    in a  future  application.   That  meant  that  the  case  should  have
    succeeded under paragraph EX.1, because it would not be  reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the UK.

 9. Mr Hussain accepted that there would be many similar cases where  a  UK
    citizen child was involved and the income threshold could not  be  met,
    but said there was a disproportionate outcome in this case.   The  best
    interests of the child should have been given "more weight".   I  asked
    what case had been made in the First-tier Tribunal  that  it  would  be
    significantly  adverse  to  the  child's  best  interests  to  live  in
    Pakistan, rather than in the UK.  Mr Hussain's response was in terms of
    the appellant's wife  being  a  UK  citizen  (although  brought  up  in
    Pakistan, and  living  there  until  2012)  with  a  settled  life  and
    employment here, who hoped to gain further qualifications as  a  dental
    nurse and did not wish to be "uprooted".  He said that the family would
    either face a long term separation, or would have to live in  Pakistan.
    He submitted that the decision should be  reversed,  either  under  the
    Rules or in terms of Article 8 outside the Rules, on the basis  of  the
    best interests of the child.

10. Ms Saddiq submitted that the grounds of appeal were misleading and that
    there was nothing to suggest that  the  judge  had  misinterpreted  the
    position put forward by the appellant.   At  paragraph  31,  the  judge
    said:

         "The  appellant  states  in  his  application  form  (D22  of   the
         respondent's bundle) that his  wife  earns  �18,662.40  per  annum.
         There is no reason why his application [from  Pakistan]  would  not
         succeed.  He would only be parted ...  until  his  application  was
         approved."

11. Mrs Saddiq directed attention to the  page  cited  of  the  application
    form, where the applicant says that his annual income is �3,028.80  and
    his wife's annual income is �18,662.40.  Thus, he represented that  his
    wife's income, although not vouched by the documents  required  by  the
    Rules, was over the income threshold.  The  judge  appreciated  exactly
    the case which was before her  and  made  no  conceivable  error.   The
    grounds to the Upper Tribunal did not itemise any other split of income
    between husband and wife.  The respondent had conceded that the  income
    requirement was met - the point of refusal maintained in the letter and
    in submissions at the  hearing  was  the  lack  of  specified  evidence
    (paragraph 11 of the determination).  Mrs Saddiq said there was plainly
    no error on the point on which permission was granted.

12. As to the best interests of the child, Mrs Saddiq  submitted  that  the
    grounds were only disagreement.  The judge dealt  thoroughly  with  the
    matter, setting out the legal approach at paragraph 16 and  going  into
    the facts at paragraphs 20, 21, 29 and  31.   She  made  an  impeccable
    assessment.  She reached her final conclusion on the likelihood of  the
    income threshold being met on a future application,  but  no  complaint
    could be made  about  that,  it  being  exactly  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant which led her to think so.

13. Finally, Mrs Saddiq said that even if the case had not  disclosed  that
    an application from abroad was likely to  succeed,  the  outcome  would
    nevertheless  have  been  justified;  but  as  the  appellant  had  not
    suggested that outcome by his evidence, the point did not arise  before
    the judge, and could not disclose any error now.

14. Mr Hussain in response said that it had been clarified in  the  witness
    statement provided for the hearing that for the preceding 6 months  the
    wife earned �8,164.80, which over a year would  amount  to  �16,329.60,
    short of the income threshold.  The full amount could be made  up  only
    by accumulating the appellant's income.  Although the  shortfall  might
    not be large, there was a possibility that the threshold could  not  be
    met if the appellant did have to return to Pakistan.  It had  not  been
    shown that his wife could  meet  the  earnings  threshold  without  his
    assistance.  Although she had a background of living in  Pakistan,  the
    couple had no present  connections  with  family  members  which  might
    assist them on return and her career prospects  would  be  jeopardised.
    They had no jobs or homes in Pakistan and so it could  not  be  in  the
    best interests of their UK citizen child to expect  him  to  leave  the
    country.  The judge had gone wrong by  referring  at  paragraph  31  to
    visits and contact through social media as an acceptable substitute for
    family life.

15. I reserved my determination.

16. The submissions for the respondent on the point on which permission was
    granted were well founded, for the  reasons  given.   The  grounds  and
    submissions for the appellant show no error by the judge  on  the  case
    before her.

17. The appellant did not have much of a case, even if it had been  clearly
    presented as one where the judge was to consider the parties'  election
    between long-term separation and life in Pakistan.  The  judge  plainly
    and rightly thought that the disadvantages were much exaggerated.   The
    appellant's position comes down to little more than an  assertion  that
    the income threshold of the Rules should be disregarded wherever  a  UK
    citizen child is involved.  That does not answer the question posed  by
    the Rules, or in terms of statute.  No coherent case  was  put  forward
    why it would be significantly adverse to  the  best  interests  of  the
    child to be brought up in Pakistan, or  what  insurmountable  obstacles
    there might be to family life in Pakistan.  The judge's  reasoning  and
    findings on that point at paragraphs 16-21 and 26-31 are not  shown  to
    be flawed.

18. The final point of criticism made in the  appellant's  submissions  was
    that the judge referred  to  the  possibility  of  visits  and  contact
    through social  media.   It  is  well  recognised  that  such  are  not
    acceptable substitutes for family life being carried on together in the
    same country, but that is not what the judge said.  Her reference is to
    the possibility of ongoing contact while  the  appellant's  application
    from  Pakistan  was  pending.   That  was   an   entirely   justifiable
    observation.

19. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

20. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
