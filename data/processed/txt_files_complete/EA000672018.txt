                       (Anonymity direction not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. On 10 July 2019 the Upper Tribunal found an error of law  had  been
         made in the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  set  that
         decision aside, albeit with preserved findings.

      2. The further listing of the appeal was adjourned with directions. On
         the 4 October 2019 the respondent sought to delay the relisting  in
         light of the respondents challenge to the  decision  in  ZA  [2019]
         UKUT 281 to the Court of Appeal.

      3. On 24 December 2019 Mr Mills, the  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
         Officer with conduct of the matter on  behalf  of  the  respondent,
         sent a further email which contains the following:

             "... my current instruction is to accept  that  ZA  is  to  be
             followed by the Upper Tribunal in remaking this  appeal.   The
             application of the guidance in ZA to the facts  of  this  case
             (as made by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  and  preserved  in
             your error of law decision in July) leads  to  the  inevitable
             conclusion that the appeal falls to be allowed.

        In the circumstances, the Upper Tribunal is invited  to  allow  the
        appeal without relisting for an oral hearing, to save costs to  the
        parties."

      4. In light of the above the  appeal  under  the  EEA  Regulations  is
         allowed.

Decision

      5. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is allowed.



    Anonymity.

      6. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
         45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
         2005.

         I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson

Dated the 21 January 2020.
