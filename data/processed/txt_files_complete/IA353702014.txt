Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Ikegwuruka, Counsel for Almonds Legals,
Solicitors, London
For the Respondent:    Ms Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria  born  on  27th  June  1978.   He
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 27th August  2014
    refusing to issue him with  a  residence  card  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  His  appeal  was  heard  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Harris on 17th  September  2015.   The
    appeal was dismissed in a decision promulgated on 2nd November 2015.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hollingworth  on  17th  May
    2016.  The permission states that the judge has set out an insufficient
    analysis of the evidence presented by the Appellant and his partner  Ms
    Ndiaye before  reaching  his  conclusions  and  he  may  have  attached
    insufficient  weight  to  the  corroborative  evidence  produced.   The
    permission states that at  paragraph  15  of  the  decision  the  judge
    acknowledges that there is no requirement under the Regulations to show
    that a durable relationship has existed for at least  two  years.   The
    grounds state that the  judge  accepted  that  supporting  evidence  of
    cohabitation had been produced.  The documentation linking Ms Ndiaye to
    the address 11 Holly Tree Court, where  it  was  claimed  she  and  the
    Appellant currently cohabit, dated from 2014 and the judge has referred
    to this stating that the evidence goes back no further than 2014.   The
    permission states that at paragraph 12 of the decision  the  judge  has
    referred to doubts being raised about the intentions of  the  Appellant
    and Ms Ndiaye since the finding that the proxy ceremony in Nigeria  did
    not comply with Nigerian law.  Paragraph 21 of the judge's decision  is
    referred to in which the judge refers to her being  in  France  at  the
    time of the hearing and this causing him to doubt her claim that at the
    date of the First-tier hearing she was exercising treaty rights in  the
    United Kingdom.

 3. Counsel for the Appellant handed to me new payslips for the Appellant's
    partner dated March 2015, July 2015, September 2015, November 2015  and
    June 2016.  He said he had only received these  on  the  date  of  this
    hearing from the  Appellant.   The  Presenting  Officer  opposed  their
    introduction.  Counsel submitted that these had been put forward purely
    to help me when making my decision.

 4. At the First-tier hearing Ms Ndiaye was in France and I  asked  Counsel
    where she is today and he said she is in the United Kingdom.   I  asked
    if she is at the hearing centre and I was told she is at work  and  had
    been unable to get the day off.

 5. Both parties agreed that the issue in this case is whether there  is  a
    durable relationship between the Appellant and Ms Ndiaye.

 6.  Counsel  submitted  that  what  has  to  be  considered   is   durable
    relationship and Regulations 8(5) and 8(6).  He submitted that there is
    sufficient evidence to show  that  the  Appellant  and  Ms  Ndiaye  are
    cohabiting.  I  was  referred  in  particular  to  the  life  insurance
    document in the Appellant's bundle, in joint names of the Appellant and
    his partner, dated 30th April 2014.  This relates to life insurance  on
    both parties' lives.  He submitted that the First-tier  Judge  did  not
    take this into account when making his decision.

 7. Counsel submitted that the Appellant accepts that  the  proxy  marriage
    cannot be given weight.  I was referred to the case  of  Kareem  [2014]
    UKUT 00024 (IAC).  This case therefore hinges on  durable  relationship
    and he  submitted  that  it  is  not  necessary  for  parties  to  have
    cohabitated for two years under the Regulations.  I  pointed  out  that
    the judge does state this in his decision.

 8. I was referred to the Appellant's bundle and the tenancy  agreement  at
    page 78 and the bank statements.  I asked if there is anything in joint
    names and I was referred to the joint life insurance policy.   I  asked
    what there is in Ms Ndiaye's name and was referred  to  the  television
    licence letter, the electoral document, a Tesco  card,  a  letter  from
    Wales and the Boots document.  Counsel submitted that the fact that the
    Appellant's wife did not attend the previous hearing does not mean that
    she is not exercising treaty rights.  She was in France  to  visit  her
    mother who was ill and she has been working in the United Kingdom.   He
    submitted that even if Ms Ndiaye had not worked for a number of  weeks,
    this does not mean that she has not been exercising  treaty  rights  as
    she is normally employed in the United Kingdom, as is evidenced by  the
    payslips.

 9. Counsel submitted that based on  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Judge his negative decision was not justified and that there are errors
    of law in the decision and it should be set aside.

10. The Presenting Officer made her submissions submitting that there is no
    error of law in the judge's decision.  She submitted that it  is  clear
    that the judge has considered all the evidence before  him  and  I  was
    referred to paragraph 19 of the decision which  states  that  there  is
    some supporting evidence of cohabitation.  The judge states,  (relating
    to Ms Ndiaye being out of the United Kingdom), "I  find  her  behaviour
    signifies that her priority at the moment is to stay  with  her  mother
    rather than reside in  the  UK  with  the  Appellant.   Ms  Ndiaye  has
    provided no information about when, if ever, she intends to  return  to
    the  UK.   This  is  also  at  odds  with  the   claimed   relationship
    subsisting".  I was referred to paragraph 20 in which the judge  states
    that he is weighing up the evidence before him and has doubts about the
    claimed subsistence of the relationship at the date of the hearing.  At
    paragraph 13 the judge states that some supporting  evidence  has  been
    produced of cohabitation and this may go back to February 2014  but  no
    further.

11. The Presenting Officer submitted that all of these matters were in  the
    judge's mind and  the  judge  does  not  require  to  mention  all  the
    documents before  him.   She   submitted  that  he  took  into  account
    everything that was before him.  She submitted that his  findings  were
    justified and it  was  open  to  him  to  dismiss  the  appeal.   After
    considering everything that was before him he  found  there  to  be  no
    subsisting durable relationship.

12. The Presenting Officer pointed out that not only  did  the  Appellant's
    wife not attend the previous hearing she has not attended this hearing.
     She submitted that this underlines the judge's concerns.   The  reason
    given was that her employer would not give her time off work,  but  the
    Presenting Officer submitted that there is not even  a  statement  from
    the Appellant's partner and based on what is before me, her  work  must
    be more important than her partner's appeal.

13. The Presenting Officer submitted that the judge's decision is clear and
    properly explained and  the  judge  finds  that  there  is  a  lack  of
    satisfactory documentation.   The  Presenting  Officer  submitted  that
    there is no material error of law in the judge's decision.

14. Counsel clarified that there is no  human  rights  application  by  the
    Appellant.

15. I was asked to look at the evidence in the round and Counsel  submitted
    that the judge did not do that.  I was referred to the Appellant's good
    immigration history and I was asked to find that his relationship  with
    Ms Ndiaye is genuine and subsisting and durable.  He submitted that  if
    I find that is the case, the judge's decision should be set  aside  and
    the Appellant's appeal should be allowed.  I was referred to  the  case
    of Miftari [2005] EWCA Civ  481.   Counsel  submitted  that  the  judge
    applied the wrong criteria in  his  assessment  and  misunderstood  the
    facts when making his decision and this is an error of law.

16. The  issue  in  this  claim  is  durable  relationship.   The  relevant
    Regulation is Regulation 8(5) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006.  The First-tier Judge had to decide  whether  a
    residence card should be issued to the Appellant and he found  that  it
    should not.

17. The proxy marriage in this case is not satisfactory as proof  that  the
    couple is married.  This is accepted by both parties.  All the evidence
    has to be considered in the round.  At  paragraph  12  of  the  judge's
    decision he states that the Appellant and Ms Ndiaye have  purported  to
    have some sort of proxy ceremony in Nigeria but he states  it  did  not
    comply with Nigerian law and this raises doubts about the intentions of
    the Appellant and Ms Ndiaye.  This is a logical statement which he  was
    entitled to make.

18. There are letters to each of the Appellant and Ms Ndiaye  at  the  same
    address.  The insurance policy has been referred to.  This is in  joint
    names and is part of the evidence before  the  judge  but  clearly  the
    judge does not find that this  can  be  given  much  weight.   This  is
    understandable as there is some correspondence from Liverpool  Victoria
    setting up a policy in joint names for 30 years at a premium of �5  per
    month dated 17 March 2014 with a direct debit instruction.  There is no
    policy on file and we do not know if the policy is still live.  All the
    premiums were being paid up to March 2015. The judge finds  it  strange
    that there is nothing else  in  joint  names  apart  from  the  tenancy
    agreement. It is dated 18th  February  2014.   It  is  clear  from  the
    decision that the judge is aware that a couple does not require  to  be
    living together for two years for there to be  a  durable  relationship
    based on the terms of the Regulations.

19. The judge found it significant that Ms Ndiaye did not attend the First-
    tier hearing and I find it significant that  she  did  not  attend  the
    First-tier hearing or this hearing. I was  told  that  she  is  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The First-tier judge was told that Ms Ndiaye's  mother
    was suffering from cancer but no medical evidence was produced.   There
    has still been no medical evidence about this produced.  There is  also
    not even a statement by Ms Ndiaye on file and nothing from her employer
    to say that he would not give her the day off to attend  this  hearing.
    The judge finds that if this is a durable relationship Ms Ndiaye  would
    have been at the hearing centre  and  again  because  of  the  lack  of
    evidence about this he was entitled to this finding

20. At paragraph 20 of the decision the judge states that  because  of  the
    findings in his previous paragraphs he has doubts about the subsistence
    of the relationship.  Based on what was before him he was  entitled  to
    find that there is no durable relationship between the Appellant and Ms
    Ndiaye within the meaning of the 2006 Regulations.  Notice of Decision

I find that there is no material error of law in the  judge's  decision  and
that  this  decision,  promulgated  on  2nd  November  2015,  refusing   the
Appellant's  appeal  for  a  residence  card  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
Regulations 2006 must stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
