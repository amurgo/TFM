Representation:
Appellant   Mr Samra (Legal Representative)
Respondent  Ms Johnstone (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, citizen of India was granted leave to enter  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 4 (general) student until May 13, 2011. Her leave was
    subsequently extended until July 16, 2014 and she then  lodged  on  May
    30, 2014 an  application  to  extend  her  stay  further  in  the  same
    capacity. The respondent refused this on  November  26,  2014  and  the
    appellant appealed this decision on  December  5,  2014  under  Section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.  Article  8
    ECHR was neither raised in the grounds of  appeal  nor  at  the  appeal
    hearing.

 2. The appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hawden-Beal  on
    March 12, 2015 and she dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules
    in a decision promulgated on March 19, 2015.

 3. The appellant sought permission to appeal that  decision  on  April  2,
    2015. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal McDade on March 20, 2015 on the basis that as  the  respondent
    had accepted the maintenance requirements were met  the  appeal  should
    have been allowed.

 4. The matter came before me on the above date and on that  date  I  heard
    submissions from both Mr Samra and Ms Johnstone.

 5. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make no order now.

    ERROR IN LAW

 6. Mr Samra relied on the grounds of appeal  lodged  in  support  of  this
    application save he did not pursue any argument in respect of article 8
    ECHR.  He argued that the judge  had  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
    appellant's  previous  immigration  history  and  the  fact   she   had
    consistently met the maintenance  requirements  since  her  arrival  in
    2010. The refusal letter accepted she had  the  correct  funds  in  her
    account (ï¿½1600) and the correct CAS documentation. The Judge failed  to
    address whether concerns raised in the refusal letter or make  a  clear
    finding that she would work and thereby breach the conditions  attached
    to her visa. There was also an element of unfairness in that the  Judge
    should have adjourned the case to enable her witness to attend  bearing
    in mind that weight was attached to this witness's absence.

 7. Ms Johnstone relied on the Rule 24 response dated  June  4,  2015.  She
    submitted that the refusal letter made it clear  on  page  2  that  the
    respondent was not satisfied she was a genuine student and  the  burden
    of proving she was lay on  her.  There  was  no  adequate  evidence  of
    financial support hence the conclusion that she  had  not  demonstrated
    she was a genuine student as the immigration officer had suggested  she
    was being paid to care for the children of the family she  lived  with.
    The fact her visa had previously been extended was not relevant and  in
    any event prior to 2014 she was maintained by her husband from whom she
    was now separated/divorced. There was no unfairness in the  proceedings
    as the appellant knew what the issues were and no application had  been
    made for an adjournment, in any event.

 8. I reserved my decision.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

 9. The appellant came to the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 student.  She  had
    originally been represented by solicitors and they served a  bundle  of
    documents on the Tribunal on February 17, 2015 and  at  the  same  time
    indicated that the appellant would be attending in person to give  oral
    evidence.

10. At the original hearing the appellant gave oral evidence but there  was
    no request for an adjournment to enable another witness to  attend  the
    hearing. She relied on the evidence submitted to support her claim that
    she was a genuine student and that she was financially supported by her
    father-this evidence was in the form of her own witness  statement/oral
    evidence along with her father's affidavit.

11. Mr Samra's argument is that as the respondent  accepted  she  satisfied
    the maintenance requirements then the appeal should have been  allowed.
    However, this submission overlooks the fact that the refusal was  under
    paragraph 245ZX(o) HC 395 which states that to  qualify  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier  4  (General)  Student  an  applicant  must  meet  the
    requirements listed including the requirement that "the applicant is  a
    genuine student." If she does not meet the  requirements  of  paragraph
    245ZX HC 395 in their entirety then the application must be refused.

12. Page 2 of the refusal letter set out the areas  of  concern.  The  mere
    fact she had the relevant amount of funds in her account did  not  mean
    she was a genuine student. The respondent was not satisfied where these
    funds came from and said as much in the refusal letter.

13. The appeal hearing was an opportunity for the appellant to address  any
    concerns that the respondent still had and in particular to address the
    fact the respondent wanted further evidence to demonstrate it  was  her
    parents who were supporting her because this was her claim. Third party
    support was not something she could rely on.  The  appellant  therefore
    relied on her own oral evidence and an affidavit provided by her father
    in which he  stated  he  had  a  savings  account  and  he  would  bear
    responsibility for all living and tuition fees  with  his  savings  and
    bank deposits being at her disposal. However, when the Judge considered
    the evidence before him she  noted  limited  evidence  of  support  and
    identified one payment in January 2014. Her explanation for  the  other
    funds was that a friend brought the monies to her but this witness  did
    not attend the hearing.

14. Mr Samra has argued the Judge should have  adjourned  the  hearing  but
    this was an appellant who had been represented until shortly before the
    hearing and her solicitors had submitted a bundle on her behalf.  There
    was no statement from this witness or even a statement from her  father
    confirming any arrangement. No application for an adjournment was  made
    and I do not  find  any  unfairness  in  the  manner  the  hearing  was
    conducted. The absence of a witness statement from either her father or
    the witness demonstrated no intention to call the witness.  The  burden
    of proof was on the appellant and  she  had  to  decide  who  to  call.
    Clearly, it was not considered necessary to take a statement  from  the
    witness or to  obtain  further  evidence  from  her  father  about  any
    arrangement. I am satisfied no  unfairness  arose  during  the  earlier
    hearing.

15. The issue for the Judge was whether she believed the  appellant  was  a
    genuine student. She had the benefit of hearing the appellant give oral
    evidence and she properly considered all of the evidence presented.

16. There was a dearth of evidence to support her  claim  that  her  father
    supported her financially. The refusal letter raised concerns but I  do
    not find the judge had to deal with every  concern  raised.  The  Judge
    rejected the core part of her evidence that she was  supported  by  her
    father and gave ample reasons for this. As the Judge properly stated in
    paragraph [23] "without evidence as to the source of the funds  in  her
    account I have to find that the appellant has not discharged the burden
    of proof...."

17. In the circumstances, I find there is no error in law.

    DECISION

18. There was no material error and I uphold the original decision.
