                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State,  we  shall  refer
    to the parties as in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  Appellant  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan born on 4th April 1986.   His  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's decision to refuse to grant leave to  remain  pursuant  to
    Article 8 was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal on 26th November 2014.



2.   The Appellant entered the UK on 8th March 2006 with entry clearance  as
    a student valid until 31st May 2009.  His leave was further extended as
    a Tier 4 student until 8th July 2011.  On 11th May 2011  the  Appellant
    was arrested for working an excess number of  hours.   A  decision  was
    made to curtail his leave  and  his  appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Eban, who found that the Appellant enjoyed  family  life
    and allowed  his  appeal.   As  a  result  the  Appellant  was  granted
    discretionary leave from 13th December 2011 to 29th  February  2012  in
    order for him to complete his studies and to marry his fiancï¿½e.

3.   On 12th February 1012 the Appellant  married  HD,  a  British  citizen.
    The Appellant then sought further leave to remain but this was  refused
    on 13th December 2012.  It would appear that the Appellant then  sought
    reconsideration and the Respondent refused to grant leave to remain  in
    a decision dated 12th June 2014 on the basis that the Appellant was not
    in a genuine and subsisting relationship with HD.

4.   At  the  hearing  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chohan,  it  was
    accepted that the appeal was on Article  8  grounds  only.   The  judge
    found that the starting point must be the decision of Judge  Eban,  who
    found that the Appellant and  HD  were  credible  witnesses  and  their
    relationship was genuine and subsisting.  In the Respondent's  decision
    of 13th December 2012 the Appellant's application had been  refused  on
    the basis that he had leave to remain for less  than  six  months.   At
    that time no issue was taken in respect of the Appellant's relationship
    with HD.

5.   In  relation  to  this  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    Respondent relied on the Appellant's  interview  record  in  concluding
    that the relationship was not genuine and subsisting.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal considered the interview record in the light of  the  findings
    made by Judge Eban. He took into  account  the  oral  evidence  of  the
    Appellant and HD which was consistent.  The judge found that HD and the
    Appellant were in a genuine and subsisting marriage.  The judge went on
    to find that the Appellant had established family life and that removal
    would interfere with his family life which would have  consequences  of
    such gravity so as to potentially engage the operation of Article 8.

6.   The judge found that since Judge Eban's  decision  nothing  had  really
    changed in respect of the parties' relationship  apart  from  the  fact
    that  they  were  now  married  and  therefore  had  reinforced   their
    relationship.  Following Judge Eban's decision, the Respondent  granted
    the Appellant leave to remain in order for him to complete his  studies
    and get married.  That he had done and the  judge  saw  no  purpose  in
    making him return to his home country in order to make  an  application
    for entry clearance.

7.   The Appellant had been  in  the  country  lawfully  and  established  a
    relationship at a time when he was here in a legal capacity. The  judge
    found that the Appellant's leave to remain  was  not  of  a  precarious
    nature. The Appellant could speak English and  the  evidence  suggested
    that he was financially independent.  The judge went on to  find  that,
    on balance, he was satisfied that the interference with the Appellant's
    family life was not necessary for any of the reasons set out in Article
    8(2) of the ECHR.

8.   The Respondent applied for permission to appeal on the ground that  the
    judge had misdirected himself in law in failing to  take  into  account
    Section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.   The
    Respondent accepted  that  the  judge  referred  to  Section  117,  but
    submitted that he did not  engage  with  the  public  interest  factors
    contained therein.  The judge had failed to adopt the correct  approach
    at paragraphs 26 to 32  and  therefore  his  Article  8  findings  were
    unsustainable as the judge  had  failed  to  properly  acknowledge  the
    public interest.

9.   In ground 2 the Respondent submitted that the judge's  conclusion  that
    nothing had really changed in respect of the Appellant's  circumstances
    was misconceived because there had been an appreciable  change  in  the
    legal landscape in relation to Section 117.  Ground  3  submitted  that
    the Article 8 assessment was fundamentally  flawed  because  the  judge
    failed to take into account the fact that family life could  reasonably
    be enjoyed in Pakistan and there was no evidence to the contrary.

10.  Ground 4 related to the burden  and  standard  of  proof  but  was  not
    relied on  at  the  hearing  and  was  adequately  dealt  with  in  the
    Appellant's skeleton argument and accordingly it did not  amount  to  a
    material error of law.

11.  Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Lambert
    on the grounds that the judge had failed to  demonstrate  that  he  had
    taken into account Section 117 of the 2002  Act  and  that  the  matter
    should have been remitted for reconsideration given that the  Secretary
    of State applied the wrong standard of proof.

12.  The Appellant submitted a Section 24 response and  submitted  that  the
    public interest requirements under Section 117B of the  2002  Act  were
    properly considered.  The judge specifically quoted relevant Article  8
    case law including the recent case of MM (Lebanon) v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 985 and  the  judge  also  made
    explicit reference to Section 117B of the 2002 Act.  At paragraph 28 of
    the decision the judge  made  specific  reference  to  the  Appellant's
    ability to speak English and  his  financial  independence  which  were
    factors to be  considered  under  Section  117B.   The  judge  properly
    directed himself following Devaseelan and the decision  of  Judge  Eban
    was the starting point.

13.  The  judge  also  considered  more  recent  factors  and  set  out  the
    balancing exercise between those factors in favour of the Appellant and
    those against him.  The judge  had  in  mind  the  public  interest  in
    removal but found that it was not proportionate to expect the Appellant
    to return to Pakistan.  The judge  properly  and  adequately  addressed
    Article 8  and  had  given  cogent  and  sustainable  reasons  for  his
    conclusion.

14.  At the  hearing  Ms  Everett  relied  on  the  grounds  of  appeal  and
    submitted that although the judge had referred to Section  117  he  had
    failed to take into account that the Appellant did not have  indefinite
    leave to remain and therefore his immigration  status  was  precarious.
    The judge should have been aware of the changes in the law  and  should
    have properly  demonstrated  that  Section  117  had  been  taken  into
    account.  The judge had not referred to whether the Appellant  and  his
    wife could enjoy family life in Pakistan  and  this  had  affected  the
    Article 8 assessment as a whole.  Chikwamba did not have any  relevance
    to this decision because currently the Appellant could not satisfy  the
    financial requirements as his income could not be taken  into  account.
    Ms Everett conceded ground 4 on  the  basis  of  paragraph  10  of  the
    Appellant's skeleton argument.

15.  Ms Beach submitted that the judge referred  to  Section  117B  and  had
    dealt with it or the factors contained therein.  The precarious  nature
    of an applicant's immigration status related only to private life,  not
    family life and therefore was immaterial in this particular  case.  The
    judge made a detailed assessment of  the  factors  in  the  Appellant's
    favour and carried out a balancing exercise.  He was  well  aware  that
    the Appellant did not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
    and of the weight to be attached to the  public  interest  in  removal.
    There was strong evidence  of  the  Appellant's  relationship  and  his
    removal would not be proportionate.

Discussion and Conclusion

16.  We find that the judge properly directed himself in  finding  that  the
    starting point was the decision of Judge Eban.  Judge Eban  found  that
    the Appellant was in a genuine relationship with HD and on the basis of
    those findings the Appellant was granted leave to remain.  The position
    in the relationship had not changed since Judge  Eban's  decision  save
    that the Appellant was now married to HD.  The  judge  dealt  with  the
    discrepancy in interview and gave adequate reasons for  his  conclusion
    at paragraph 22.  The judge's finding that the Appellant and HD were in
    a genuine relationship was one which was open to him on the evidence.

17.  It was accepted that the Appellant could not satisfy  the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules and therefore the judge applied the five stage
    test set out in Razgar.  He  properly  directed  himself  following  MM
    (Lebanon) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA  Civ
    985 and specifically stated that he had  taken  into  account  Sections
    117A and 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The
    judge made findings in respect of that Section at paragraph 28  of  the
    determination.  He found that the Appellant had  made  his  application
    whilst residing  in  the  country  lawfully  and  had  established  his
    relationship at a time when  he  was  here  legally.   He  could  speak
    English and he was financially independent.

18.  The judge had clearly taken  into  account  the  change  in  the  legal
    landscape and applied it to the specific facts of the Appellant's case.
     The judge's finding that the Appellant had established family life and
    his removal would interfere with his family life was open to him on the
    evidence before him.  The judge properly assessed  proportionality  and
    took into account all relevant factors attaching significant weight  to
    the public interest as demonstrated at paragraph 25 of the decision.

19.  We find that the judge's decision to allow  the  appeal  on  Article  8
    grounds was open to him on the evidence before him  and  there  was  no
    material error of  law  in  the  decision.   The  decision  dated  26th
    November 2014 shall stand.  The Respondent's appeal is dismissed.
