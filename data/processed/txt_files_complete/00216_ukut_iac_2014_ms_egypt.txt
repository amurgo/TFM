                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Akinbolu, instructed by VC Legal (UK)


The requirement to prove the existence of "contracts" in paragraph 41-SD  of
Appendix A to the immigration rules does not itself  require  the  contracts
in question to be contained in documents.  There is,  however,  a  need  for
such contracts to be evidenced in documentary form.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against a  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Holder allowing the appeal of the respondent  (whom
    we shall call the claimant)  against  a  decision  dated  17  May  2013
    refusing  leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

 2. The judge's findings were as follows:

        "16. It can be seen from the Refusal Letter that the Respondent:
             a)  is satisfied that the Appellant has access to ï¿½50,000; and
             b) is satisfied that he meets the requirements of provision (d)
               of Table 4 to Appendix A (i), (ii) and (iii).


        17. The Respondent is not satisfied that the  Appellant  has  shown
           that he meets the requirements of provision (d) of  Table  4  to
           Appendix A (iv), namely:
              that he is engaged in business activity, other than the  work
           necessary to administer his business,  in  an  occupation  which
           appears  on  the  list  of  occupations  skilled   to   National
           Qualifications Framework Level 4 or  above,  as  stated  in  the
           Codes of Practice in  Appendix  J,  and  provides  the  specific
           evidence in paragraph 41-SD.


        18. I find from the Refusal Letter that the Respondent accepts that
           the Appellant has provided satisfactory evidence of a job title.


        19. However, the remaining  issue  is  whether  the  Appellant  has
           submitted satisfactory evidence of  contracts.   The  Respondent
           asserts that the purchase orders provided by  the  Appellant  do
           not reveal the services that he is providing. In other words, it
           is asserted that he  has  not  provided  sufficient  documentary
           evidence to show that he is operating  as  Sales  and  Marketing
           Director.


        20. I find from the combination of the Appellant's evidence and the
           documentation   provided   (including   the    Certificate    of
           Incorporation of PLCEUROPE LIMITED, the tax  documentation,  the
           accounts, the website information for the  Appellant's  company,
           his advertising  and  marketing  information  and  the  numerous
           purchase   orders/Pro-forma   invoices   and    sales/commercial
           invoices)  that  the  Appellant  has  demonstrated  that  he  is
           operating as  a  Sales  and  Marketing  Director  for  PLCEUROPE
           LIMITED.


        21. I also find that  the  combination  of  the  numerous  purchase
           orders/pro-forma invoices  and  sales/commercial  invoices  that
           these form contracts between his company and the  purchasers  of
           his goods.
           I find that these documents (when looked at compendiously)  meet
           the requirements of paragraph 41-SD(c).  The combination of  the
           three principal types of document reveal those matters  required
           by paragraph [41-SD(c)(iv)(1)-(3)][1] are present.
           I accept (in the absence of a  submission  by  the  Respondent's
           representative to the contrary) that these documents were before
           the Respondent prior to the Respondent's decision.


        22. Taking into account all of the above and the papers before  me,
           I find that the reasons given by the Respondent do  not  justify
           the refusal of this application and that the Appellant does  not
           [sic]  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph   245DD   of   the
           Immigration Rules.
              The Appellant should be awarded a minimum of 75 points  under
           paragraphs 35 to 53 of Appendix A".

 3. The Secretary of State appeals on the following grounds:

          "The Appellant's application was refused on the basis that he  did
          not fulfil the  requirements  of  provision  (d)  of  Table  4  of
          Appendix A of the Immigration  Rules  -  he  could  not  meet  the
          requirements of requirement (iv).  The refusal letter  of  17  May
          (please see asterisked paragraph on the copy attached) states  For
          requirement (iv) although you have provided a job  title  that  is
          listed in Appendix J, you have failed to  provide  any  contracts.
          The purchase orders  that  you  have  provided  do  not  meet  the
          requirements of the Immigration Rules as they do  not  detail  the
          services that you are providing. You have therefore  not  provided
          the specific documents to demonstrate that you are operating as  a
          Sales and Marketing Director.  As the refusal letter sets out, the
          evidence specified at paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A has  not  been
          provided.


          At paragraph 21 of the determination, the FTTJ states: I also find
          that the combination of  the  numerous  purchase  orders/pro-forma
          invoices and sales/commercial invoices that these  form  contracts
          [sic] between his company and the purchasers of his goods.  I find
          that these documents  (when  looked  at  compendiously)  meet  the
          requirements of paragraph 41-SD(c).  The combination of the  three
          principal types of  document  reveal  those  matters  required  by
          paragraph [41-SD(c)(iv)(1)-(3)] are present.


          It is submitted  that  41-SD(c)(iv)  is  very  clear:  please  see
          attached an extract from the Rules current at the date of decision
          from which the below is quoted


              "(iv) one or more contracts showing trading.  If  a  contract
              is not an original the    applicant must sign  each  page  of
              the contract.  The contract must show:
                  (1) the applicant's name and the name of the business
                  (2) the service provided by the applicant's business; and
                  (3) the name of any other party or  parties  involved  in
                     the contract and  their  contract  details,  including
                     their full address, postal code, landline phone number
                     and any email address."


          It is submitted that the above is very plain about what is  needed
          and that given what it specifies, it was not open to the  FTTJ  to
          find  that  'the  combination  of  the  numerous  orders/pro-forma
          invoices and sales/commercial invoices' comprised  contracts  such
          as to meet the requirement of the Rules."

 4. Ms Akinbolu's skeleton, provided before the hearing, draws attention to
    the fact that in English law a contract is not  typically  a  document,
    but a meeting of minds.  At the hearing we heard brief submissions from
    Mr Richards, and did not need to call on Ms Akinbolu.

 5. The Secretary of  State's  position   is  that  the  Immigration  Rules
    envisage a contract included in a single document, and that a series of
    documents that together show all material required by  the  Rules  does
    not constitute "a contract".  We can  see  no  proper  basis  for  that
    assertion.  The intention behind the Rules is that the claimant be able
    to show that he is genuinely trading.  It strikes us  as  inconceivable
    that the entrepreneur route was to be confined to the types of  trading
    in which contracts are made by single documents.  Paragraph 41-SD  very
    properly specifies that there must be documentary  evidence  sufficient
    to show genuine contracts, and  containing  sufficient  information  to
    enable the Secretary of State  to  check  the  matter  with  the  other
    parties for the contracts if she chooses to do  so.   But  there  is  a
    world of difference between requiring contracts to be  evidenced  by  a
    proper paper trail and requiring each contract to  be  contained  in  a
    single document.  In our judgment the Rules require the former, but not
    the latter.

 6. No other issue has been raised in relation to the judge's decision.  We
    have looked at the documents that were before him, and,  like  him,  we
    regard them as including all the relevant material when read  together.
    For these reasons we consider that  he  made  no  error  in  law.   The
    Secretary of State's appeal is accordingly dismissed.
