Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr E Anyene (Counsel)


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The Secretary  of  State  has  appealed,  with  permission,  against  a
    decision of a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and  Asylum
    Chamber) (hereinafter the "judge" unless otherwise stated)  promulgated
    on 21st January 2015, following a hearing on 6th January 2015, by which
    he allowed the appeal of  Mr  Shaddai  Shalom  Smith  (hereinafter  the
    "claimant") against a decision of the Secretary of State of 20th August
    2014 to make a deportation order by virtue of Section  3(5)(a)  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971.  The decision followed the claimant's  conviction
    at Wood Green Crown Court on 22nd  December  2010  for  an  offence  of
    robbery in respect of which he was  sentenced  to  a  period  of  three
    years' custody in a young offenders' institute.

 2. The claimant was also convicted, at Havering Magistrates' Court, on 8th
    August 2008, on two counts of attempting/making  false  representations
    in order to make a gain for himself or another.  He was sentenced to  a
    community order in respect of that.  In June 2009 he was  cautioned  in
    respect of an offence of criminal damage to a car window.

Immigration History and Background Facts

 3. The claimant is a national of Barbados.  He was born on 7th March 1990.
     It has been variously suggested, in the documentation before me,  that
    he first arrived in the UK in 2001 as a visitor (see  paragraph  10  of
    the judge's determination) or that he first arrived on 26th  July  2002
    as the dependent child of a work permit holder (see paragraph 7 of  the
    Respondent's "notice of decision").  In any event nothing turns on  the
    precise date of his arrival and it is clear that he had come to the  UK
    to join his mother who had herself arrived in the UK as a  work  permit
    holder having divorced his father.

 4. On 2nd October 2004 the claimant received a grant of leave to remain as
    a dependent child until 31st October 2007.  There  followed  a  further
    grant, on the same basis, until 7th December 2012.

 5. The claimant formed a relationship with one Miss  President  (according
    to her oral evidence the relationship had started  in  2007)  a  dental
    nurse and British citizen.  On 4th June 2011, she  gave  birth  to  the
    couple's daughter who is, of course, also a British citizen.

 6. The claimant served what he was required  to  serve  of  his  custodial
    sentence and was released  on  20th  January  2012.   He  rejoined  his
    mother's household.  He has a younger brother, Nathan, who  also  lives
    in that household.  He did not go to live with Miss President  and  had
    not been living with her prior to his incarceration.   She  lives  with
    the couple's child.  There is evidence that he has  maintained  contact
    with the child.

 7. On 6th November 2012 the  claimant  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the UK on the  basis  of  "long  residence".   However,  that
    application was rejected because the correct fee  had  not  been  paid.
    Shortly after, on 20th December 2012, he made a further application for
    indefinite leave to remain which was again rejected, this time on  23rd
    January 2013, as the correct fee had not been paid.  On  22nd  February
    2013 a similar application was  made  but  rejected  for,  essentially,
    similar reasons.  On 14th October 2013 he made another application  for
    indefinite  leave  to  remain  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.   That
    application has been considered along with the matters relating to  his
    deportation.  Indeed,  on  17th  June  2014  he  was  informed  of  his
    liability to deportation and the decision to make a  deportation  order
    followed on 20th August 2014.  He  appealed  and  has,  throughout  the
    appeal  process,  sought  to  rely  upon  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights  (ECHR)  in  resisting  deportation  and  in
    seeking leave.

Relevant Legal Provisions

 8. The relevant legal provisions are Section 117B to D of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002 Act")  and  paragraphs  398,
    399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules.

 9. Section 117A to D of the 2002 Act, which came into effect on 28th  July
    2004, provides as follows:

         "117A    Application of this Part

         (1)  This Part applies where a court or  Tribunal  is  required  to
             determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts -



             (a)  breaches a person's right  to  respect  for  private  and
                  family life under Article 8 and

             (b)  As a result would be unlawful  under  Section  6  of  the
                  Human Rights Act 1998.

         (2)  In considering the public  interest  question,  the  court  or
             Tribunal must (in particular) have regard -

             (a)  in all cases, to the  considerations  listed  in  Section
                  117B and

             (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
                  to the considerations listed in Section 117C.

         (3)  In sub-Section (2), 'the public interest question'  means  the
             question of whether an interference with a person's  right  to
             respect for private and family life is justified under Article
             8(2).

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases

         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
             public interest.

         (2)  ...

         (3)  ...

         (4)  Little weight should be given to -

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that  is
                  established a person at a time when the person is  in  the
                  United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
             a person at a time when the  person's  immigration  status  is
             precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where -

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child,

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom.

         117C  Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
             interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
             the greater is the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  the
             criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ('C')  who  has  not  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,
             the public interest requires C's deportation unless  Exception
             1 or Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
                  most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
                  Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to  be
                  deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.

         (6)  ...

         (7)  The considerations in sub-Sections (1) to (6) are to be  taken
             into account where  a  court  or  Tribunal  is  considering  a
             decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent  that
             the reason for the decision was the offence  or  offences  for
             which the criminal has been convicted.

         117D Interpretation of this Part

         (1)  In this Part -

             'Article 8' means Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on
             Human Rights;

             'Qualifying child' means a person who is under the age  of  18
             and who -

             (a)  is a British citizen, or

             (b)  has lived in the United Kingdom for a  continuous  period
                  of seven years or more;

             'qualifying partner' means a partner who -

             (a)  is a British citizen, or

             (b)  is settled in the United Kingdom (within the  meaning  of
                  the Immigration Act 1971 -  see  Section  33(2)A  of  that
                  Act).

         (2)  In this Part 'foreign criminal' means a person -

             (a)  who is not a British citizen,

             (b)  who has been  convicted  in  the  United  Kingdom  of  an
                  offence,

             (c)  who -

                  (i)  has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  at
                      least twelve months, or

                  (ii) has been convicted of  an  offence  that  has  caused
                      serious harm, or

                  (iii)    is a persistent offender."

10. It is also necessary to set out the contents of paragraph 398, 399  and
    399A of the Immigration Rules.  Since both the  decision  under  appeal
    and the subsequent hearing before the judge took place after 28th  July
    2014 it is beyond dispute that the Rules in the  form  that  they  were
    from that date are the ones which apply.  The relevant  parts,  in  the
    context of this claimant's circumstances, read as follows;

         "398.    Where a person claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
                  contrary to the UK's obligations under Article  8  of  the
                  Human Rights Convention, and

                  (a)  ...

                  (b)   the  deportation  of  the  person  from  the  UK  is
                      conducive to  the  public  good  and  in  the  public
                      interest because  they  have  been  convicted  of  an
                      offence for which  they  have  been  sentenced  to  a
                      period of imprisonment of less than four years but at
                      least twelve months; or

                  (c)  ..., the Secretary of State in assessing  that  claim
                      will consider whether paragraph 399 or  399A  applies
                      and,  if  it  does  not,  the  public   interest   in
                      deportation will only be outweighed by other  factors
                      where there are very  compelling  circumstances  over
                      and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.



         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or  (c)  applies
                  if -

                  (a)  the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                      relationship with a child under the age of  18  years
                      who is in the UK, and

                      (i)  the child is a British citizen; or

                      (ii) ...; and in either case;

                           (a)  it would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to
                               live in the country to which the  person  is
                               to be deported; and

                           (b)  it would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to
                               remain in the UK without the person  who  is
                               to be deported; or

                  (b)  the person has a genuine and subsisting  relationship
                      with a partner who is in the  UK  and  is  a  British
                      citizen or settled in the UK, and

                      (i)  the relationship was formed at a time  when  the
                           person (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and then
                           immigration status was not precarious; and

                      (ii) it would be unduly harsh  for  that  partner  to
                           live in the country to which the person is to  be
                           deported,  because  of  compelling  circumstances
                           over and above those described in paragraph EX.2.
                           of Appendix FM; and

                      (iii)    it would be unduly harsh for that partner to
                           remain in the UK without the person who is to  be
                           deported.

         399A.    This paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
                  applies if -

                  (a)  the person has been lawfully resident in the  UK  for
                      most of his life; and

                  (b)  he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK;

                  (c)  there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
                      integration into the country to which it is  proposed
                      he is deported."

The Decision of the Judge

11. Both parties were represented before the judge.  He heard oral evidence
    from the claimant, from Miss President and from the claimant's  mother.
    In his determination he reviewed some case law which he  considered  to
    be relevant and summarised the cases which had  been  advanced  by  the
    competing parties.   He  then  explained  his  decision  to  allow  the
    claimant's appeal in this way;

         "30. The background history of this Appellant is that he arrived in
             the United Kingdom aged 12 years as the dependent child of his
             mother, a work permit  holder.   On  26th  November  2007  the
             Appellant  was  ultimately  granted  leave  to  remain  as   a
             dependent child of his mother until 7th November 2012.

         31.  The criminal history of the Appellant is not contested by  the
             Appellant.  On 8th August 2008 the Appellant was sentenced  to
             a community order for 40 hours and �70 costs for two counts of
             attempting or making false representations to make gain.

             In June 2009 the Appellant was cautioned  for  an  offence  of
             criminal damage.  This was not a  criminal  conviction  but  a
             caution accepted by the Appellant.

             The index offence for which the  Appellant  received  a  three
             year custodial sentence on  22nd  December  2010  was  for  an
             offence of robbery.  Clearly this was  a  serious  offence  as
             reflected by the sentence imposed.

             I have taken into account the sentencing remarks of His Honour
             Judge Browne QC.  I also note that there  were  a  number  co-
             defendants, some of whom pleaded to guilty to the  charge  and
             others like the Appellant who  maintained  not  guilty  pleas.
             The judge in his  sentencing  remarks  explained  to  all  the
             defendants, including the Appellant, why such  robberies  were
             "so serious".

                  'This  is  group  activity,  which   takes   recognisance,
                  planning  and  then  targeting  the  van  that   must   be
                  identified'.

                  'The vulnerable point is  the  custodian  outside  in  the
                  street carrying the cash'.

                  'The fear of violence, the fear of intimidation,  must  be
                  ever present in that guardian's duty  every  day.   It  is
                  cowardly what you have done'.

                  'This is  not  minor  pickings,  this  is  rich  pickings,
                  thousands of pounds in cash gone forever, putting  up  the
                  price of  food,  the  price  of  petrol,  for  the  honest
                  citizen, it is as simple as that'.

             The judge acknowledged that  this  was  a  less  sophisticated
             commercial robbery and that it was not professionally  planned
             and that no weapons were used.  The judge  remarked  that  the
             Appellant was 20 years of age and a driver for  just  the  one
             day.  The defendants were looking for a likely target  van  to
             rob and it was  determined  to  rob  the  BP  garage  of  over
             �14,000.  The Appellant's vehicle was  the  'switch  vehicle'.
             The judge could not give the Appellant  credit  for  a  guilty
             plea  since  he  was  convicted  by  the  jury,  but  it   was
             acknowledged  that  he  was  a  man  of  good  character  with
             excellent references and a  university  student  at  Greenwich
             University and that the Appellant at that time had a  pregnant
             girlfriend,   which   I   assume   to   be   Miss   President.
             Notwithstanding such mitigating  factors,  the  Appellant  was
             nevertheless sentenced to three years' detention  in  a  young
             offenders' institute.

         32.   I  should  pay  regard  to  paragraph  399   and   399A   and
         applicability.

             The Appellant claims to have family life in the United Kingdom
             with his daughter, Mya.  Mya is presently just over  3�  years
             of age.  The requirements of the exception to  deportation  on
             the basis of family life with a child are set out at paragraph
             399(a) of the Rules.  I am satisfied that this Appellant has a
             genuine and subsisting parental relationship with his 3�  year
             old daughter and that the child is  a  British  citizen.   The
             Contact Order from Romford County  Court  which  was  made  in
             October 2013 would seem to imply  that  the  County  Court  at
             least  acknowledges  that  this  Appellant   has   a   genuine
             relationship with his daughter, since in the  absence  of  any
             such relationship one could question the merits of  the  court
             making such a contact order with a young child.  The evidence,
             not only of this Appellant at this hearing, but also  that  of
             the Appellant's mother, Norma Marshall,  and  the  Appellant's
             partner, Miss President, are wholly consistent with regard  to
             this Appellant's care, love and affection  for  his  daughter,
             Mya.  The contact is regular and whilst the Appellant does not
             live in the same house as his daughter I am satisfied that the
             nature and regularity of contact between the Appellant and his
             daughter is genuine, subsisting and meaningful and that  there
             is a strong bond between this Appellant and his  daughter.   I
             also accept that due to the limited financial status  of  this
             Appellant, he personally  is  unable  to  provide  maintenance
             payments for his daughter, but with the  financial  assistance
             of his  mother  he  regularly  provides  Miss  President  with
             maintenance payments for his daughter.

             I also am satisfied that Miss President welcomes  the  contact
             between father and daughter  and expresses the view that  this
             Appellant  should  be  involved  in   his   daughter's   life,
             notwithstanding  his  past   criminal   behaviour.    She   is
             supportive in developing and further in contact between father
             and daughter.  Therefore, taking into account all the evidence
             before me, I am satisfied that the Appellant has established a
             family life in the United Kingdom with his child.

         33.  In determining whether  there  was  a  family  life  with  the
             Appellant's partner, I have considered paragraph 399(b) of the
             Rules.  I am  satisfied  that  Miss  President  is  a  British
             citizen.  I am not however satisfied that  there  is  credible
             and reliable evidence that the Appellant  has  a  genuine  and
             subsisting relationship with Miss President, other than to the
             extent that Miss President, as the mother of  the  Appellant's
             daughter, is supportive of  the  County  Court  contact  order
             between her daughter and the  Appellant.   The  Appellant  has
             never cohabited with his claimed partner, either before prison
             or subsequently.  The relationship between the  Appellant  and
             his claimed partner was formed in  2007  when  this  Appellant
             only held limited leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.   He
             should be aware that by committing criminal offences he  would
             be liable for removal or deportation, as well as  being  aware
             of  the  problems  that  such  conduct  would  have   on   his
             relationship.  Nevertheless, the Appellant engaged in criminal
             behaviour between 2008 and 2010.  It is my understanding  that
             Miss President would have no intentions of leaving the  United
             Kingdom to join the Appellant in Barbados.  She has no  family
             in Barbados and all her family and network of friends  are  in
             the United Kingdom.  I also note that  in  the  past  she  has
             relied  on  her  own  parents  in  the   United   Kingdom   to
             occasionally look  after  her  daughter  while  she  has  been
             working and whilst the Appellant did not do so.  It  may  well
             be that the Appellant was not contacted by Miss  President  at
             that time due to ongoing problems and  the  break  up  of  the
             relationship for a period of approximately one  year.   Whilst
             noting  the  wishes  of  Miss  President,  I  am  nevertheless
             satisfied that there are no restrictions upon her in  visiting
             the Appellant in Barbados, or relocating to Barbados  if  that
             was her wish at some time in the future.  In any event,  I  am
             satisfied that the relationship between the Appellant and  his
             partner could be maintained by any such occasional  visits  or
             by modern methods of communication, including e-mail, Skype or
             even by telephone.  Deporting the Appellant to Barbados is not
             unduly harsh upon his partner  and  taking  into  account  the
             criminal conduct in this context it is in the public  interest
             for such a deportation to occur.  I am not satisfied that  the
             Appellant has established a family life in the United  Kingdom
             with his partner, Miss President.

         34.  I shall pay regard to the criteria set out at  paragraph  399A
             of the Rules.  This exception applies where all three limbs of
             the specific exception have been established in order for  the
             public interest in deportation to be outweighed.

             The Appellant has not been lawfully  resident  in  the  United
             Kingdom for most of his life since he  had  limited  leave  to
             remain until 7th December 2012 when his  leave  expired.   The
             Appellant would only appear to have held lawful  residence  in
             the  United  Kingdom  for  ten  years  and  four  months.   He
             currently has no legitimate leave  to  remain  in  the  United
             Kingdom.

             He is clearly not financially independent as he  is  currently
             unemployed and  relies  on  accommodation,  as  well  as  some
             financial assistance from his mother with whom he lives.   The
             Appellant has failed to establish  that  he  would  not  be  a
             burden on the British tax  payer.   The  Appellant's  criminal
             conduct clearly shows  that  whilst  residing  in  the  United
             Kingdom he was apart from the society wherein  he  would  have
             had to integrate himself with.  The Appellant spent the  first
             twelve years of his life in Barbados.  It  is  unclear  as  to
             whether this Appellant has any  relatives  in  Barbados.   The
             Appellant believes that he has and the mother of the Appellant
             disputes this is the case.  In any event the existence of ties
             has been considered in a number of cases, the  most  important
             of which is Ogundimu (Article 8 - new  rules)  Nigeria  [2013]
             UKUT 00060 (IAC).  In paragraphs  123  and  124  the  Tribunal
             stated the following -

                  'The natural and  ordinary  meaning  of  the  word  'ties'
                  imports we think a concept involving something  more  than
                  merely  remote  and  abstract  links  to  the  country  of
                  proposed deportation.  It would appear that ties covered a
                  wide variety of social, cultural and familiar matters'.

             It is not just a question of language and I am satisfied  that
             this Appellant having spent the first twelve years of his life
             in Barbados acquired considered cultural and social ties  with
             that country.  Furthermore, not only does the  mother  of  the
             Appellant continue to visit Barbados almost annually, but this
             Appellant has on three separate occasions returned to Barbados
             with his mother between 2004 and 2006.

         35.  Since this Appellant cannot  satisfy  the  requirements  under
             paragraph 399 or 399A of the Rules, I need to consider whether
             there are circumstances which are sufficiently  compelling  to
             outweigh the public interest in deportation.  In  reaching  my
             findings, I am well aware of the principles  outlined  in  the
             case of SS Nigeria [2013] EWCA Civ 550, which  held  that  the
             more pressing the public interest, the  more  serious  is  the
             need for deportation.  This required the  application  of  the
             two  stage  approach  identified  in  MF  (Nigeria)  and   the
             principles in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720  (Admin)  where  it  would
             only be in exceptional circumstances that a person's right  to
             family and/or private life would outweigh the public  interest
             in deportation.  In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that
             there are exceptional circumstances, or indeed very compelling
             circumstances,  which  outweigh   the   public   interest   in
             deportation in this case.

         36.  It is significant that the Appellant  arrived  in  the  United
             Kingdom when he was just 12 years of age.  He  has  spent  the
             whole of his teenage life, his youth and  adult  life  in  the
             United Kingdom.  He completed  his  education  in  the  United
             Kingdom and went to university in the United Kingdom.   Whilst
             I understand and appreciate that the decision in the  case  of
             Masih (deportation  -  public  interest  -  basic  principles)
             Pakistan [2012] UKUT 00046 (IAC) preceded Section  19  of  the
             Immigration Act 2014, as well  as  a  number  of  more  recent
             decisions regarding Article 8 and deportation, I am  satisfied
             that the decision of the Tribunal in the case of Masih  is  of
             importance.  The  Tribunal  held  that  when  considering  the
             relevant facts on private and family life under Article  8,  a
             person who had lawfully spent 'all or the major part of his or
             her childhood and youth in this country, very serious  reasons
             are required to justify expulsion'.

             I am also aware in the Court of Appeal decision  in  Gurung  v
             SSHD  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  62  that  the  'absence  of  a   risk
             reoffending, though plainly important, is not the ultimate aim
             of the deportation regime'.

             In the absence of an OASys or probation report, I am unable to
             assess the risk of reoffending by this  Appellant.   I  cannot
             presume a risk or not.  All  I  can  say  is  that  since  the
             commission of  this  offence  and  the  Appellant's  custodial
             sentence, there have been no criminal  convictions  whatsoever
             committed by this Appellant.

         37.  Whilst  not  undermining  the  serious  nature  of  the  index
             offence, the sentencing judge  remarked  that  it  was  not  a
             sophisticated robbery and that no weapons were used  and  that
             it was not professionally planned.  The Appellant was of  good
             character and the Appellant acted as a  driver  on  that  day.
             When the Appellant committed the offence he was sentenced to a
             young offender institute as opposed to a prison due  to  being
             under 21 years of age.

         38.  There is no credible and reliable evidence before me that this
             Appellant represents a continued threat to the  wellbeing  and
             protection of the public as stated by the  Respondent  in  the
             refusal letter.

         39.  I must also take  into  account  the  Contact  Order  made  by
             Romford County Court on 4th October  2013.   The  Court  Order
             that the mother of the child make  that  child  available  for
             contact with the Appellant as the father as  could  be  agreed
             between the mother and father.  Deportation of this  Appellant
             would clearly break any contact between the Appellant and  his
             young daughter, apart from any occasional visits  to  Barbados
             by the mother and  daughter.   In  performing  the  Article  8
             balance regard should be had to the welfare of a child of  the
             family (Singh v ECO New Delhi [2004] EWCA  Civ  10  75).   The
             best interests of a child should not be under valued and there
             is no substitute for a careful  examination  of  all  relevant
             factors when the interests of  a  child  are  involved  in  an
             Article 8 assessment.  A child should not be  blamed  for  the
             conduct of a parent (Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74).

             Paying due regard to Section 55, I am satisfied that it is  in
             the best interests of the Appellant's  child  that  he  should
             remain in the United Kingdom and remain  in  regular  physical
             contact with her, notwithstanding that at the present time the
             child lives with her mother and not this Appellant.

         40.  I am aware from the decision in McLarty that Parliament  views
             the object of deporting those with a criminal record as a very
             strong policy.  However, the weight to  be  attached  to  that
             concept will include a variable component which  reflects  the
             criminality in issue.  Whilst Parliament has tilted the scales
             strongly in favour of  deportation,  I  am  satisfied  on  the
             evidence before me that there are  exceptional  circumstances,
             or indeed compelling reasons why the Appellant should  not  be
             deported.

         41.  This Appellant is defined as a foreign criminal  by  reference
             to Section 117D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
             2000.  Section 117C  is  additional  considerations  in  cases
             involving  foreign  criminals.   In  the  case  of  a  foreign
             criminal  who  has  not  been  sentenced  to   a   period   of
             imprisonment of  four  years  or  more,  the  public  interest
             requires  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or  Exception   2
             applies.  Exception 1 cannot apply since  this  Appellant  has
             not been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for  most  of
             his life, even if he had socially and culturally integrated in
             the United Kingdom, and even if there  were  very  significant
             obstacles to his integration into Barbados.

             For reasons  which  I  have  previous  stated,  I  am  however
             satisfied  that  there  are  compelling  reasons   which   are
             exceptional whereby the right  to  private  and  private  life
             outweighs the public interest  in  deporting  this  Appellant.
             The requirement to pay regard  to  the  definition  of  public
             interest may not be  in  absolute  terms.   Article  8  is  in
             absolute terms in that if an Appellant's  private  and  family
             life is potentially engaged, it is unlawful to remove  him  if
             the decision  to  do  so  would  be  disproportionate.   I  am
             satisfied  that  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  would  be
             disproportionate in that it infringes the Appellant's right to
             respect for both his private and family  life  in  the  United
             Kingdom."

12. The judge then went on to indicate that he was  dismissing  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules but allowing it "on Human Rights Grounds".

The Grounds

13. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  are  not  always  easy  to
    follow but appear to  contain  contentions  that  the  judge  erred  in
    failing to properly consider whether the claimant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with the child, in failing to make any
    findings as to whether it would be unduly harsh for the child to go  to
    live in Barbados or to remain  in  the  UK  without  the  claimant,  in
    failing to explain why the factors he found to weigh in favour  of  the
    claimant outweighed the public interest in his deportation, in  failing
    to identify what "exceptional circumstances" there were, in failing  to
    adequately consider the possibility of  Miss  President  relocating  to
    Barbados, and in failing to have regard to guidance  contained  in  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v AJ  (Angola)  [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 1636.  Permission to appeal, however, was granted simply  in  these
    terms.

         "3.  The judge spoke of the need to identify  exceptional  or  very
             compelling  circumstances  outweighing  the  public   interest
             (paragraph 35) noting the requirements of Sections 117C and  D
             of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and made a
             finding that family life outweigh the public interest.

         4.   The judge on a fair reading of the Decision  did  not  however
             give reasons for reaching that conclusion.

         5.   A failure to give necessary reasons constitutes  an  error  of
             law."

14. At the hearing, Mr Whitwell provided me with a copy of the judgment  in
    AJ (Angola), cited above together  with  a  copy  of  the  judgment  in
    McLarty (Deportation  -  proportionality  balance)  [2014]  UKUT  00315
    (IAC).  He said, whilst accepting that the grounds appeared  to  betray
    something of a scattergun approach, that he would rely upon all of them
    though he contended that the crux was whether or not  adequate  reasons
    had  been  given  for  the  conclusion  that  there  were   exceptional
    circumstances such as to outweigh the public interest in the claimant's
    deportation.  He contended that the judge had accepted, at paragraph 35
    of the determination, that none of the requirements of paragraph 399 or
    399A had been met.  So, in order to properly explain why the claimant's
    appeal should succeed the judge had to identify  something  else  which
    was exceptional.  He had failed to  recognise  "the  new  weighting  of
    exceptionality" under the current statutory regime.  He  had  erred  in
    relying upon what was said in Masih bearing in mind what had been  said
    about that decision in McLarty.  He had not properly explained why  the
    claimant was not a risk to the  public.   He  had  not  properly  taken
    account of the  fact  that  the  Immigration  Rules,  with  respect  to
    deportation, are a complete code.

15. Mr Anyene reminded me that the claimant had arrived in the UK at a very
    young  age.   The  judge  had  been  clear  at  paragraph  35  of   the
    determination in stating that, in his  view,  there  were  sufficiently
    compelling  circumstances  to   outweigh   the   public   interest   in
    deportation.  Thus, he had applied the correct test.

16. It does seem to me that there is a lack of clarity in the determination
    which  has  resulted  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  being
    inadequate to the extent that an error in law is established.

17. In this context, as was stressed in McLarty but also  in  a  number  of
    other judgments, AJ (Angola) being one, it is apparent that  Parliament
    does view the object of deporting foreign criminals as  a  very  strong
    policy which is constant in all cases.  What will amount to  compelling
    reasons  or  exceptional  circumstances  is  fact  dependent  but  must
    necessarily  be  seen  in  the  context  of  the  articulated  will  of
    Parliament in favour of deportation.  As Mr Whitwell  submits,  primary
    legislation and the content of the  Immigration  Rules  does  tilt  the
    scales strongly in favour of deportation.

18. It is right to point out that the judge did, at  paragraph  35  of  the
    determination, state that he did have to consider  "whether  there  are
    circumstances which are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the  public
    interest  in  deportation".   However,  whilst  going  on  to  identify
    considerations weighing in the claimant's favour such  as  the  contact
    with the child and the claimant having arrived in  the  UK  at  a  very
    young age, he did not  explain  why  those  factors,  even  when  taken
    together, were capable of amounting to  very  compelling  circumstances
    over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.  Nor in  his
    consideration of the paragraph 398 test did he indicate  he  had  taken
    into account countervailing  points  such  as  the  offending  and  the
    deterrence aspect of deportation.  His assessment, therefore,  did  not
    demonstrate a proper appreciation of the extent  to  which  the  scales
    have now been tipped in favour of deportation and the required force of
    the arguments which might cause the balance to swing  in  favour  of  a
    person seeking to challenge deportation.

19. The judge specifically indicated he was dismissing the appeal under the
    Immigration Rules, albeit, that he was allowing it under Article  8  of
    the ECHR.  The Rules, though, in the  context  of  deportation,  are  a
    complete code as was indicated by the Court of Appeal in  MF  (Nigeria)
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.  Such an error will not always be a material  one
    but it did mean, in this case, that the judge was not  looking  at  the
    question of the claimant's Article 8 rights "through the  lens  of  the
    new Rules themselves" (see AJ (Angola)), but, rather, was or  may  have
    been taking a more freestanding approach.

20. The judge failed to carry out a proper or complete  evaluation  of  the
    possible applicability of paragraph  399(a)  of  the  Rules.   In  this
    context, he did clearly accept that the  claimant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with his child and clearly did  accept
    that the child was a British citizen.  However, he did not then  go  on
    to consider the possible applicability of 399(a)(ii)(a)  and  (b).   Mr
    Anyene, rather ambitiously it seems to me, urged me  to  conclude  that
    the judge had, in fact, decided that all the requirements of 399(a) had
    been met and that, in consequence, the opening words of paragraph 35 of
    his determination contained a typing error.  I do  not  think  that  is
    right because if he had been deciding that those requirements were  met
    then he would not have found it necessary  to  go  on  to  conduct  any
    further assessment of the Article 8 arguments.  The error  is  of  some
    importance, though, because the extent to which  a  claimant  fails  to
    satisfy the requirements of 399 or the requirements of 399A, can be  of
    relevance  when  considering   the   question   of   "very   compelling
    circumstances" for the purposes  of  398.   It  also  meant,  from  the
    claimant's perspective, that there had been  an  incomplete  assessment
    such that he could not be certain why it had been concluded that he did
    not satisfy 399(a).

21. A matter of potential relevance to the question of whether  there  were
    the necessary  compelling  circumstances  was  the  likelihood  of  the
    claimant reoffending.  The judge noted the absence of an "OASys" report
    and said that, as a consequence, he was unable to assess  the  risk  of
    reoffending.  (Paragraph 36 of the determination).  He then went on  to
    point out as part of his explanation as to  why  he  was  allowing  the
    appeal, that there was "no credible and reliable  evidence  before  me"
    that the claimant represented "a continued threat to the wellbeing  and
    protection of the public".  It seems to me, though,  that  despite  the
    absence of an OASys report, which was  of  course  unhelpful,  it  was,
    nevertheless, incumbent upon the judge to take a view as to the risk of
    reoffending for himself based upon all of the evidence he did have.

22. It is clear from paragraph 36  of  his  determination  that  the  judge
    attached considerable importance to what was said by the Upper Tribunal
    in Masih (deportation - public interest -  basic  principles)  Pakistan
    [2012] UKUT 00046 (IAC).  He said  that  he  was  satisfied  that  that
    decision was "of importance" and stated of it;

         "The Tribunal held that when  considering  the  relevant  facts  on
         private and family life under Article 8, a person who had  lawfully
         spent 'again all the major part of his or her childhood  and  youth
         in this country, very  serious  reasons  are  required  to  justify
         expulsion'."

23. As Mr Whitwell points out,  Masih  and  its  continuing  relevance  was
    considered by the Upper Tribunal in McLarty.  At paragraph 21 the Upper
    Tribunal said this;

         "Finally, in relation to cases we should refer to the  decision  of
         the UT in Masih v SSHD (Blake J and UT Judge Freeman)  [2012]  UKUT
         00046 (IAC).  In this case the UT laid  down,  at  paragraph  11  a
         series of principles which it was  intended  would  be  applied  in
         future deportation cases involving criminality.  On their face they
         accurately reflect the law as it  stood  at  the  time.   But  they
         predate SS Nigeria (ibid) and MF (Nigeria) (ibid).   In  particular
         they do not emphasise the  fact  that  Parliament  has  spoken  (in
         favour of deportation) and this is a consideration that  the  Court
         of Appeal in SS (Nigeria) (ibid) has made clear must be given great
         weight.  It seems to us therefore that to be consistent with recent
         case law emphasising this point Masih should no longer  be  treated
         as guidance, on this point."

24. Thus, in light of  that,  the  judge's  reliance  upon  Masih,  and  it
    appeared to be substantial reliance, was misplaced.   Further,  and  in
    any event, it was not right to say that the claimant had lawfully spent
    all or the major part of his or her childhood  and  youth  in  the  UK,
    given that he did not arrive until he was aged 11 or 12 years  and  has
    not had valid leave since December 2012.

25. It is right to say, therefore, that there are a number of problems with
    the judge's reasoning  though  the  main  difficulty  is  the  lack  of
    explanation as to why the favourable circumstances  identified  in  the
    determination satisfied, against the background of the  importance  now
    to be accorded to the public interest in deportation, the  requirements
    of paragraph 398.

26. I do appreciate  that  the  judge  clearly  set  about  his  task  with
    diligence but I do conclude that his determination contains  errors  of
    law of a material nature.  I do, therefore, set the decision aside.

27. Given that the claimant succeeded in the appeal before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and that there is a child involved in this appeal and  bearing
    in mind the Court of Appeal's judgment in JD (Congo) and Others  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 327 and taking into account the views of the  representatives,
    I have concluded that it is appropriate to remit this case to the First-
    tier Tribunal with the directions which follow below.

28. Finally, no anonymity order was made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    none was sought before me.  Accordingly, no such order is made.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.  I set  aside  the  decision.   The  case  is
remitted to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with  the  directions  set
out below and on the basis that it be heard by another judge of  the  First-
tier Tribunal.

I make no anonymity order.
