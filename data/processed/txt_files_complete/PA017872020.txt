                            DECISION AND REASONS


    Introduction:
    Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because
    the case involves protection issues. I find that it is  appropriate  to
    continue the order. Unless  and  until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs
    otherwise, the appellant is  granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these
    proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him.  This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent. Failure to  comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Iraq, appeals with permission  against  the
    decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Fisher)   (hereinafter
    referred to as the "FtTJ")  who  dismissed  his  protection  and  human
    rights appeal in a decision promulgated on the 25 August 2020.


 2. Permission to appeal that decision was sought  and  on  10  March  2020
    permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb.

 3. The hearing took place  on  28  April  2021,  by  means  of  Skype  for
    Business. which has been consented  to  and  not  objected  to  by  the
    parties. A face-to-face  hearing  was  not  held  because  it  was  not
    practicable,  and  both  parties  agreed  that  all  issues  could   be
    determined in a remote hearing.   The advocates attended  remotely  via
    video. There  were  no  issues  regarding  sound,  and  no  substantial
    technical problems  were  encountered  during  the  hearing  and  I  am
    satisfied both advocates were able to make their  respective  cases  by
    the chosen means.



The background:

 4. On 23 January 2008, the appellant entered the UK clandestinely by lorry
    and he claimed asylum. His asylum claim  was  refused  and  his  appeal
    against that decision was dismissed by Immigration Judge Atkinson on  8
    October 2008. The Judge accepted that he was an Iraqi Kurd from  Kirkuk
    who had worked as a barber but did not believe his account that he  was
    targeted by members of Ansar-Al Islam on account of his activities as a
    barber.  The  judge  found  that  his  account  was  inconsistent   and
    implausible and he was not a credible witness and rejected all  aspects
    of the appellant's account which were put in issue  by  the  respondent
    (paragraph 34). The judge concluded that he  was  not  the  subject  of
    specific threats issued by Ansar Al Islam.

 5. The appellant was considered to have exhausted his appeal rights by  30
    January 2009 but the materials demonstrate that there followed a series
    of further submissions, all of which were refused.

 6. The most recent  submissions  were  lodged  on  20  October  2017.  The
    respondent accepted that they amounted to a fresh claim. However,  they
    were refused for the reasons set out in the decision  letter  dated  10
    February 2020.

 7. The decision letter began its consideration of the appellant's claim by
    making reference to the decision of Judge  Atkinson  promulgated  on  8
    October 2008 applying the principles in Devaseelan ( at paragraphs 3  -
    9).

 8. The appellant claimed that the security situation in Iraq was one  that
    reached Article 15 C  of  the  Qualification  Directive,  that  he  was
    undocumented and therefore unable to return and also claimed that if he
    returned he would be unable  to  secure  employment  and  would  become
    destitute without family support that his removal would be in breach of
    Article 3 of the ECHR.

 9. It was further claimed that he would be persecuted on return because of
    his Kurdish ethnicity. Reference is made to a report by Prof Ali  dated
    27 July 2015 entitled "general risk on return for Kurds  to  Iraq"  but
    the respondent considered that report  predated  the  country  guidance
    decision in  SMO and others (Article 15 ( c); identity documents)  Iraq
    CG [2019] UKUT 00400.

10. By reference to SMO, the respondent concluded that the tribunal did not
    rule out returns of Kurdish people to the IKR and concluded at [24]  it
    was possible to apply and obtain documentation from the  Iraqi  embassy
    in the UK to enable return to south and central Iraq.

11. Reference was also made to the CPIN dated November 2018 that in general
    conditions are not so severe the removal of a person to  Iraq  amounted
    to a breach of Article 3 of the ECHR. There was  also  reference  to  a
    report from the Danish  refugee  Council  published  April  2016  which
    stated, "various sources stated that Iraqi citizens who originate  from
    the IKR will not face problems returning there."

12. The respondent concluded that applying SMO and  other  recent  evidence
    (the Danish refugee Council report) demonstrated that enforced  Kurdish
    returnees would be accepted in either Baghdad or  Erbil  and  voluntary
    undocumented returnees would be accepted in the  current  situation  is
    shown by the report by the Danish refugee Council. It was not  accepted
    as shown in SMO that the security situation most of  Iraq  was  serious
    enough in general that the removal of a person would amount to a breach
    of Article 3  of  the  ECHR  or  Article  15  c  of  the  qualification
    directive.

13. SMO was cited in the decision letter at paragraphs  27  -  29  and  the
    respondent took into account that the appellant had not demonstrated or
    submitted evidence that he did not have contact with family or  friends
    who would be able to offer him  financial  and  physical  support  upon
    return.

14. Consideration was given to his claim that he  could  not  return  as  a
    result of his religious beliefs as a Sunni Muslim  in  accordance  with
    the material set out at paragraphs 25 - 26 of the decision letter.

15. In summary, the respondent did not accept that the  security  situation
    in Iraq was one that attracted Article 15(c), that he would be at  risk
    of serious  harm  or  persecution  as  a  result  of  his  religion  or
    ethnicity. It was considered that it had not been demonstrated that  it
    would be unduly harsh to return to Baghdad  where  he  could  make  the
    onward journey to Kirkuk to be reunited with  family  and  friends  and
    obtain their support and assistance. It was not accepted that he failed
    to show that he lost contact with his family or friends in  Kirkuk  who
    may be able to support and assist upon return and it was  not  accepted
    that it made all efforts available to obtain a CSID or a passport.

16. The application was therefore refused.

17. The appeal came before the FtT on 13 August 2020.

18. The FtTJ considered the protection appeal in the light of  the  country
    guidance of SMO and others (Article 15 ( c); identity  documents)  Iraq
    CG [2019] UKUT 00400 ("SMO") and concluded that  the  appellant's  home
    area of Kirkuk was no longer a "contested area" and could return  there
    and that he did not fall into any of the categories outlined  would  be
    at risk of harm ( at [18]).

19. At [12] the FtTJ made reference to the account that he had given to the
    previous judge in August 2008 and one which the tribunal had found been
    inconsistent and  implausible  and  not  supported  by  the  background
    evidence. The judge  recorded  that  had  been  accepted  at  the  Case
    Management Review Hearing that there was no new evidence to support the
    appellant's previous account and it was conceded that the issues raised
    would  have  been  treated  as  settled  following  the   decision   in
    Devaseelan. However, the judge agreed that he was required to determine
    the issue of whether the appellant was in contact with his family.

20. At [13] the FtTJ resolved that issue in favour  of  the  appellant  and
    gave reasons as to why he was satisfied that the appellant was  not  in
    contact with any family members who may be in Kirkuk or Iraq.

21. However at [14] the FtTJ concluded that would  not  necessarily  be  an
    obstacle to his return and that in the original asylum  application  he
    had produced a copy of his CSID card. Having considered the decision in
    SMO the judge reached the conclusion that he could obtain documentation
    from the embassy in the UK. The FtTJ at [16] did not consider that  the
    evidence set out in the respondents CPIN post-dated the decision in SMO
    or that it demonstrated that a replacement CSID could not  be  obtained
    at the consulate and that it was "merely advice in terms  of  obtaining
    the new INID". Furthermore, the judge did not feel able to  attach  any
    real weight to the appellant's visits to the consulate as he considered
    much would depend on the information provided to the staff. Furthermore
    there was no  evidence  from  the  consulate  as  the  information  the
    appellant gave. The judge therefore concluded that the appellant  would
    be able to obtain a CSID in the UK which would enable him to return  to
    Iraq and travel from Baghdad to his home area (at [17]).  He  therefore
    dismissed the appeal.

22. The appellant sought permission to appeal that decision and  permission
    was granted by UTJ Grubb on 13 January 2021 for the following reasons:

         "it is arguable, on the basis of the grounds, that the judge  erred
         in finding that the  appellant  could  obtain  a  replacement  CSID
         before returning to Iraq. In particular, the June 2020 CPIN appears
         to require a reconsideration of what was said in  SMO  and  others,
         based upon the evidence then available, that the Iraqi  embassy  in
         the  UK  could  issue  a  replacement  CSID.  For  these   reasons,
         permission to appeal is granted."



The submissions of the parties:

23. Ms Brakaj on behalf of the appellant relied upon the written grounds.

24. The written grounds set out that the issue in the case was whether  the
    appellant had contact with his family and whether  he  could  obtain  a
    replacement document to enable him to return to Iraq and in  particular
    his home area of Kirkuk.

25. It is submitted that the FtTJ considered the country guidance  decision
    in SMO and accepted that the appellant had lost contact with his family
    that  considered  that  the  copy  CSID  could  be  used  to  obtain  a
    replacement CSID from within the UK and it is on this basis that it  is
    considered the appellant could return.

26. It is further submitted that whilst the country guidance is dealt  with
    within the CPIN of May 2020, the June  CPIN  regarding  redocumentation
    also changes the  conclusions  regarding  the  redocumentation  process
    within the UK and therefore if the most up-to-date country guidance  is
    to be considered, the subsequent changes contained within  the  reports
    must  also  be  taken  into  account.  The  failure  to  consider   the
    respondent's current position in relation to the ability  to  obtain  a
    CSID in the UK is flawed.

27. The grounds cite the most recent CPIN Iraq: internal relocation,  civil
    documentation returns version 11.0 June 2020 and expressly the  further
    evidence  at  point  e  culminating  in  2.6.16  based  on  the   above
    information, it is highly unlikely that an individual would be able  to
    obtain a CSID from the Iraqi embassy while in the UK. Instead a  person
    would need to apply for a registration document (1957) and  then  apply
    for an INID upon return to their local CSA office in Iraq.

28. It is therefore submitted that the determination  was  based  upon  the
    assumption that the  appellant  could  obtain  a  replacement  and  the
    rejection of what occurred when he visited the  embassy  in  Manchester
    was not in accordance with the respondents published information. It is
    submitted that the appellant would require his CSID in order  to  reach
    at home area and the respondents country information  shows  that  this
    could not be obtained from within the UK. Therefore  the  decision  was
    legally flawed.

29. In her oral submissions she stated that the issue related  whether  the
    appellant would be able to obtain a replacement CSID  in  the  UK.  She
    submitted that it was now accepted by Mr Walker that he no  longer  had
    the original CSID or access to it. The appellant is from Kirkuk and the
    clear position is that the INID system is rolled out in Kirkuk.

30. The issue before the FtTJ was whether the embassy could issue him  with
    a CSID which was the conclusion of Judge Fisher. The  appellant  relied
    upon the evidence in the CPIN to  state  that  the  embassy  no  longer
    issued documents and may only act as a post-box if family members could
    assist. She submitted it did not apply here as Kirkuk  had  rolled  out
    the INID system. This confirmed the appellant's evidence as to why  the
    embassy in the UK would not provide him with any  documents.  Thus  the
    judge was in error in reaching that finding given the material that was
    before the FtTJ and that his account was consistent with the  objective
    material  that  they  do  not  issue  documents.   His   evidence   was
    straightforward and was consistent with the objective material.

31. She further submitted that the FtTJ was in error by  stating  that  the
    CPIN did not postdate the decision of SMO and  was  irrelevant  to  the
    issue of documentation.

32. There was no rule 24 response in behalf of the respondent. I heard oral
    submissions from Mr  Walker.  He  informed  the  tribunal  that  having
    considered the grounds in the light of the  decision  of  the  FtTJ  he
    conceded that the decision of the FtTJ demonstrated the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law and that the respondent's own guidance  in  the
    CPIN set out that the  appellant  would  not  be  able  to  obtain  the
    relevant documents in the UK, and  that  as  the  appellant  came  from
    Kirkuk, as Ms Brakaj had set out, the INID system was in place there .

33. Both parties are therefore in agreement that the FtTJ made  a  material
    error of law in his decision and that as a result the  decision  should
    be set aside and re-made allowing the appeal.

34. Reference was made to the decision of SMO being remitted to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the issue of knowledge of the family book.  Both  advocates
    confirmed that they were not asking the tribunal to stay  any  decision
    to await a further consideration by the tribunal. Both parties  invited
    the Tribunal to re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.

35. In the light of the agreement reached by the parties that the  decision
    of the FtTJ involved the making of an error on appoint of law and  that
    the decision should be set aside and re-made by allowing the appeal, it
    is only necessary for me to set out briefly  my  reasons  for  agreeing
    with the concession made.

36. The issue before the FtTJ related to the documents that he could obtain
    whilst in the United Kingdom. At [13] the FtTJ set out that he accepted
    that the appellant was not in contact with his family members and  this
    had been a consistent claim for several  years  and  that  he  accepted
    having been away from Iraq for 12 years and of being of limited  means,
    it would be difficult for him to employ anyone  to  trace  his  family.
    Furthermore, the judge took into account the agreed  evidence  that  he
    had been in contact with the Red Cross in an attempt  to  trace  family
    members. The judge further took into account from  his  own  experience
    that the situation Kirkuk had been "challenging in the past  especially
    when it was one of the  formally  contested  areas".  Thus  he  made  a
    finding that the appellant was not in contact with any  family  members
    in Iraq and said that none of them would be able to assist if  required
    to redocument himself.

37. The FtTJ at [14] considered however that the appellant would be able to
    obtain a replacement CSID through the Iraqi Consular facilities in  the
    UK and that this depended on being able to recall the  information  the
    family book, which the judge was satisfied that he knew.

38. The FtTJ at [16] was provided with information at the hearing that  was
    set out in the respondents CPIN which demonstrated that CSID cards were
    being phased out and replaced by INID cards and confirm that it was not
    currently possible to apply for an INID card outside of Iraq  and  that
    as a result the Iraqi embassy was said to be advising nationals in  the
    UK to apply instead for a "registration document (1957)" which they can
    use to apply for other documents such as passport or an INID once  they
    had returned to Iraq.  The  information  required  to  apply  for  such
    registration document was set out at paragraph [16].

39. It is accepted on behalf of the respondent that the FtTJ was  in  error
    in his conclusions  at  [17]  where  he  stated  that  the  information
    contained in the CPIN did not postdate the decision in SMO and did  not
    confirm when the information was provided. Furthermore, the  respondent
    accepts that the information in the CPIN did set out the  circumstances
    relating to documents which post-dated SMO.

40. Whilst the FtTJ did not attach weight to the appellant's evidence as to
    the visit made to the consulate, I accept the  submission  made  by  Ms
    Brakaj that the appellant's evidence was consistent with  the  contents
    of the CPIN which states that the embassy no longer  issues  CSID's  in
    the UK and whilst they may act as a "post-box" if family members  could
    assist, this could not apply in the circumstances of  this  appellant's
    case given that he is from Kirkuk where the INID system has been rolled
    out. Thus the appellant's evidence that the embassy would not issue him
    with any documents was consistent with the objective material.


41. When considering the issue of documentation, the relevant part of the
    headnote reads as follows:

         "C.    CIVIL STATUS IDENTITY DOCUMENTATION


          11. The CSID is being replaced with a new biometric Iraqi National
             Identity Card  -  the  INID.   As  a  general  matter,  it  is
             necessary for an individual to have one of these two documents
             in order to live and travel within Iraq  without  encountering
             treatment or  conditions  which  are  contrary  to  Article  3
             ECHR.   Many of the checkpoints in the country are  manned  by
             Shia militia who  are  not  controlled  by  the  GOI  and  are
             unlikely to permit an individual without a CSID or an INID  to
             pass.  A valid Iraqi passport is not recognised as  acceptable
             proof of identity for internal travel.


         12.  A Laissez Passer will be of no assistance in the absence of  a
             CSID or an INID; it is confiscated upon arrival and is not, in
             any  event,  a  recognised  identity   document.    There   is
             insufficient evidence to show that returnees are issued with a
             'certification letter' at Baghdad Airport, or to show that any
             such document would be  recognised  internally  as  acceptable
             proof of identity.


         13.  Notwithstanding the phased transition to the INID within Iraq,
             replacement CSIDs  remain  available  through  Iraqi  Consular
             facilities.  Whether an individual will be able  to  obtain  a
             replacement CSID whilst in the UK  depends  on  the  documents
             available and, critically, the availability of the volume  and
             page reference of the entry in the Family Book in Iraq,  which
             system  continues  to  underpin  the  Civil  Status   Identity
             process.  Given the importance of that information, most Iraqi
             citizens will recall it. That information may also be obtained
             from family members, although  it  is  necessary  to  consider
             whether such relatives are on the  father's  or  the  mother's
             side because the registration system is patrilineal.


         14.  Once in Iraq, it  remains  the  case  that  an  individual  is
             expected to attend their local CSA office in order to obtain a
             replacement document.  All CSA  offices  have  now  re-opened,
             although the extent to which records have  been  destroyed  by
             the conflict with ISIL  is  unclear  and  is  likely  to  vary
             significantly depending on the extent  and  intensity  of  the
             conflict in the area in question.


         15.  An individual returnee who is not from Baghdad is  not  likely
             to be  able  to  obtain  a  replacement  document  there,  and
             certainly not within a reasonable time.  Neither  the  Central
             Archive nor the assistance facilities for IDPs are  likely  to
             render documentation assistance to an undocumented returnee.


         16.  The likelihood of obtaining a replacement identity document by
             the use of a proxy, whether from the UK or on return to  Iraq,
             has reduced due to the introduction of the  INID  system.   In
             order to obtain an INID, an individual must attend their local
             CSA office in person  to  enrol  their  biometrics,  including
             fingerprints and iris scans.  The CSA offices  in  which  INID
             terminals have been installed are unlikely - as  a  result  of
             the phased replacement of the CSID system - to issue  a  CSID,
             whether to an individual  in  person  or  to  a  proxy.    The
             reducing number of CSA offices in which  INID  terminals  have
             not been installed will continue to issue CSIDs to individuals
             and  their  proxies   upon   production   of   the   necessary
             information.


42. As to the issue of redocumentation, both parties have referred  to  the
    respondent's guidance on this issue. As set out at paragraph 2.6.16  of
    the Home Office Country Policy and Information  Note  entitled:  "Iraq:
    Internal relocation, civil documentation and  returns",  version  11.0,
    dated June 2020 (hereafter "the June 2020 CPIN"):

         "it is highly unlikely that an individual would be able to obtain a
         CSID from the Iraqi Embassy while in the UK. Instead a person would
         need to apply for a registration document (1957) and would then
         apply for an INID upon return to their local CSA office in Iraq."


43. In that regard, both advocates relied upon paras 2.6.15 and  2.6.16  of
    the CPIN (June 2020) which is in the following terms:

         " 2.6.15  Since  SMO  was  promulgated  in  December  2019  further
         information regarding the issuance of CSIDs  in  the  UK  has  been
         obtained by the Home Office in April 2020 [see Annex I]. When asked
         to describe the process of obtaining a CSID from the Iraqi  Embassy
         in London the Returns Logistics department stated:


         'CSID cards are  being  phased  out  and  replaced  by  INID  (Iraq
         National Identification) cards. It is  not  currently  possible  to
         apply for an INID card outside of Iraq.  As  a  result,  the  Iraqi
         embassy in London are advising their nationals in the UK  to  apply
         instead for a 'Registration Document (1957)' which they can use  to
         apply for other documents such as passports or an  INID  card  once
         they have returned to Iraq.


         'The registration document  (1957)  must  be  applied  for  on  the
         applicant's behalf by a nominated representative in Iraq. In  order
         to start the application, the  individual  requiring  documentation
         would normally provide at least one copy  of  a  national  identity
         document [see  paragraph  2.6.24  for  list  of  national  identity
         documents]  and  complete  a  power  of  attorney  (to  nominate  a
         representative in Iraq) at the Iraqi embassy along with the embassy
         issued application forms.  If  they  have  no  copies  of  identity
         documents they also would need  to  complete  a  British  power  of
         attorney validated by the FCO and provide parents names, place  and
         date of birth to their nominated representative in Iraq.'


         'Once  issued  the   nominated   representative   will   send   the
         registration document (1957)  to  the  applicant  in  the  UK.  The
         process takes 1-2 months.'


         'The HO cannot apply for documentation other than  Laissez  Passers
         on someone's behalf but the embassy is willing to check to  see  if
         the individual  already  holds  documents  and  provide  copies  if
         necessary.'


         2.6.16 Based on the above information, it is highly  unlikely  that
         an individual would be able to obtain a CSID from the Iraqi Embassy
         while in the UK. Instead  a  person  would  need  to  apply  for  a
         registration document (1957) and would then apply for an INID  upon
         return to their local CSA office in Iraq."

44. According to the Home Office's own guidance, therefore, it is therefore
    accepted by both parties  that the Appellant is not able to redocument
    himself whilst in the UK.

45. It is therefore common ground between the advocates that the  appellant
    will not be able to  apply  for  or  obtain  a  CSID  in  the  UK.  The
    alternative route suggested in the CPIN is an application for  a  "1957
    document". As set out at paragraph [13]  the  FtTJ  accepted  that  the
    appellant had lost contact with all family  members  in  Iraq  and  the
    appellant would require a "nominated  representative"  with  access  to
    documents. However even if he had a "nominated representative"  it  has
    not been explained how the document known as a "1957 document" could be
    used once in Iraq to travel internally.  The  document  appears  to  be
    limited to enabling the issue of a laissez pass� for internal travel.

46. In SMO,  paragraph 425 provides:

         "The CSID is being replaced with a  new  biometric  Iraqi  National
         Identity Card - the INID.  As a general matter, it is necessary for
         an individual to have one of these two documents in order  to  live
         and travel within Iraq without encountering treatment or conditions
         which are contrary to Article 3 ECHR.   Many of the checkpoints  in
         the country are manned by Shia militia who are  not  controlled  by
         the GOI and are unlikely to permit an individual without a CSID  or
         an INID to pass.  A valid  Iraqi  passport  is  not  recognised  as
         acceptable proof of identity for internal travel.

47. What is relevant is the appellant's home area. At paragraph 16 of the
    headnote of SMO, KSP & IM (Article 15(c); identity documents) Iraq CG
    [2019] UKUT 400 (IAC), obtaining a replacement CSID is now unlikely to
    be possible where the person seeking the document is from a governate
    where the INID system has been rolled out:

         "The CSA offices in which INID terminals have been installed are
         unlikely - as a result of the phased replacement of the CSID system
         - to issue a CSID, whether to an individual in person or to a
         proxy."


48. As per paragraph 431 of SMO� "It is likely, to our mind, that the CSA
    office in Kirkuk has an INID terminal and that it would not be willing
    to issue a CSID to the appellant through a proxy ..." Kirkuk is
    therefore one of those cities in which the INID system has been rolled
    out.


49. Therefore in order to obtain an INID, the appellant would have to
    attend the CSA office in Kirkuk in person, as set out at paragraph 45
    of SMO:

         "In order to obtain an INID, an individual must attend their local
         CSA office in person to enrol their biometrics, including
         fingerprints and iris scans."

50. In order to obtain a new INID, the Appellant would therefore have to
    travel along the Baghdad-Kirkuk road.

51. The appellant as a former resident of Iraq as opposed to the IKR,  will
    be returned to Baghdad. The position of the respondent is that for this
    appellant the only destination for  an  enforced  return  would  be  to
    Baghdad. The Appellant would be returned to Baghdad, not  the  KRI.  As
    set out at 4.2.1 of the June 2020 CPIN,

         "There are international flights to Erbil International Airport
         (EBL) and Sulaymaniyah International Airport (ISU). However, it
         should be noted that all enforced returns are to Baghdad and that
         only those willing to return voluntarily can travel directly to the
         KRI."



52. In order to obtain a new INID, the Appellant would therefore have to
    travel along the Baghdad-Kirkuk road.

53. I have therefore had to consider the circumstances for the appellant on
    return without a CSID/INID and therefore at risk of treatment in breach
    of Article 3 if he seeks to travel from Baghdad. In this context, it is
    common ground that he would arrive without any form  of  documentation,
    having not been able to obtain it in the  United  Kingdom.  He  has  no
    contact with any family.

54. An appellant without any documentation would remain at the airport  and
    not be able to travel to Baghdad as such a  journey  would  entail  him
    passing through several checkpoints (see SMO cited above).

55. Even if it could be said that someone  in  Iraq  could  attend  at  the
    airport, that would not assist the appellant in light of  the  evidence
    in SMO as any ability to do so depends on whether the appellant is from
    an area where CSID's are still issued or whether the alternative system
    referred to in SMO, the INID has now been rolled out and  in  operation
    which is an entirely different system that requires his  attendance  in
    person.

56. Both advocates have referred to paragraph [431]  of  SMO  where  it  is
    stated that the CSA office in Kirkuk  no  longer  operates  the  system
    whereby a CSID will be provided. It has an INID terminal and  there  is
    no evidence that the authorities will be willing to issue a CSID to the
    appellant through a proxy. It must follow that in the event that he has
    no access to a CSID, and that he is not able to obtain a replacement in
    the UK, I am satisfied that as the Upper  Tribunal  said  in  SMO,  his
    return to Iraq would be in breach of Article 3 of the ECHR.

57. I have not been provided to any evidence on behalf of the respondent to
    undermine that  conclusion  in  SMO.  As  the  civil  Registry  in  the
    appellant's home area has rolled out the new system which  operates  an
    INID terminal, in order to obtain the requisite document,  which  is  a
    biometric document, it will be necessary for the  appellant  to  attend
    that office in person to provide those biometric details.

58. As to obtaining a CSID from Baghdad, an individual returnee who is  not
    from Baghdad, which is the position of this appellant, is not likely to
    be able to obtain a replacement document or to do so  in  a  reasonable
    time. The central archive and the facilities for IDP's are  not  likely
    to provide assistance for an undocumented returnee. The appellant would
    not be able to board a domestic flight beyond Baghdad  or  to  the  IKR
    without either a CSID or INID or invalid passport.

59. Given that the enforced route of return is  to  Baghdad,  and  that  in
    light of the assessment he would not  be  able  to  leave  the  airport
    without such document, it follows that the appellant will be in Baghdad
    with no form of support and thus the risk of destitution applies.  This
    is the factual assessment made by the Secretary of State in the country
    guidance decisions when addressing Article 15 (b).

60. In the decision of SMO, the Upper Tribunal recorded the evidence  which
    they describe as "uncontested" that a failure to produce a CSID or,  in
    the environs of the airport a valid passport, will be likely result  in
    detention until the authorities could be satisfied of  an  individual's
    identity.

61. The appellant could not relocate to  Baghdad,  given  that  he  is  not
    likely to be documented and therefore the guidance in SMO (applying the
    former guidance in AA (Iraq) (set out in annex A to SMO) does not apply
    to the appellant. Furthermore, paragraph  414  of  SMO  refers  to  the
    circumstances that in order to reside in Baghdad,  an  individual  from
    the formally contested areas will require security clearance  and  "two
    sponsors from the neighbourhood in which they intend to reside as  well
    as a support  letter  from  the  local  Mokhtar".  That  has  not  been
    explained any further by the respondent and in any event the likelihood
    of obtaining a sponsor residence in Baghdad would be dependent again on
    the  individual  being  "documented".  Furthermore,  in  the  preceding
    country guidance case of AAH (Iraqi Kurds) [2018] UKUT 212 it was  held
    at paragraph 98 as an ethnic Kurd without a CSID and no family  members
    in Baghdad could not reasonably be expected to relocate there.

62. In conclusion it is accepted by the parties that  the   appellant  does
    not have Iraqi identity documentation and  will  not  be  able  to  re-
    document in the UK or within a reasonable time upon return to Iraq  and
    without the relevant documentation, country background information  and
    the country guidance decisions make it plain, and is  accepted  by  the
    respondent before me, the appellant would be at risk of serious harm in
    Iraq.

63. The decision of Judge Atkinson and followed by Judge  Fisher  concluded
    that the appellant had not demonstrated a risk of persecution  in  Iraq
    based on a Convention reason (see paragraph [12] of  FtTJ's  decision).
    Thus the appellant succeeds on the basis that  he  will  be  unable  to
    reside in Iraq without being at a real risk of serious harm for reasons
    relating to the absence of the identity documentation. Thus  to  return
    the appellant to Iraq would be in breach of Article 3 of the  ECHR  and
    Article 15(b) as set out in the Immigration Rules.

Decision:

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of  an  error
on a point of law and the decision is set aside; the appeal  is  re-made  as
follows: the appeal is allowed on humanitarian protection  grounds  (Article
15 (b) and under  the  Immigration  Rules,  and    human  rights  grounds  (
Article 3).

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or his family members. This direction  applies  both
to the Appellant and  to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
