                                   Between

               THE Secretary of State FOR THE Home Department
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                             Mr Frederick Larbi

                                                                 Respondents


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Kotas (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondents:   Mr S Rungasamy (Legal Representative)


                             NOTICE OF DECISION

1.   The respondents' appeals against decisions  to  remove  them  from  the
    United Kingdom to Ghana were allowed by a First-tier Tribunal Judge, on
    human rights grounds, in a decision promulgated on 10 July  2015.   The
    Secretary of State was given permission to appeal against the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal on 29th September 2015.

2.   Mr Kotas, for the Secretary of State, said that  the  appellant  wished
    to withdraw her case and that the respondents'  representative  was  in
    agreement with that proposal.  One of the children was  now  a  British
    citizen and, in all the circumstances, withdrawal was  the  appropriate
    course.

3.   Having  heard  from  Mr  Kotas  and  briefly  from  Mr  Rungasamy,  who
    confirmed that his  clients  were  in  agreement,  the  Upper  Tribunal
    consents to the withdrawal of the appellant's case, under rule 17(2) of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

4.   In the light of the withdrawal of the Secretary of  State's  case,  the
    only formal step now required is the dismissal of  the  appeal  against
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, which decision shall stand.






Signed                                  Date


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge R C Campbell
