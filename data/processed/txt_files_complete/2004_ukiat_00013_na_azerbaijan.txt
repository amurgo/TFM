Miss S Haji (counsel instructed by Dozie & Co) for the claimant
Miss J Sigley for the Secretary of State

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is what purports to  be  an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  an
   adjudicator, Mr P Brenells, sitting at Taylor House on 15 May 2003.   We
   say "purports", because the adjudicator ended his decision by  upholding
   the Secretary  of  State's  certificate.   This  was  not  the  kind  of
   certificate, with which  everybody  is  familiar,  certifying  only  the
   asylum appeal, because there had  already  been  a  human  rights  claim
   before  the  Secretary  of  State;  and  it  is  quite  clear  that  the
   certificate applied to the claim as a whole. It follows that it was  not
   caught by the decision of the Court of Appeal in  Zenovics  [2002]  EWCA
   Civ 273, and it must be regarded as prima facie valid.

2. We raised this point, because it occurred to Mr Parkes,  who  had  given
   permission in this case, that,  on  a  correct  view  of  the  law,  the
   certificate had prevented him from considering any such  application  at
   all. Miss Haji asked us to disregard the certificate, on the basis  that
   current policy was to withdraw all certificates issued  under  the  1999
   Act. Miss Sigley pointed out that that policy only came  into  operation
   as from June 2003; so probably did not cover the present decision, which
   was issued on 11 June.  Certainly, there had been no  withdrawal  before
   the adjudicator.

3. While the delay and cost to  public  funds  is  regrettable,  we  cannot
   accept Ms Haji's argument that either the legitimate  expectation,  such
   as it may have been, that an appeal would be heard by the  Tribunal;  or
   the change in Home Office  policy,  since  the  adjudicator's  decision,
   could possibly confer a power on us to hear such an  appeal,  which  the
   statute does not give us.  We are a creature of statute and  cannot  get
   our powers from any other source. It follows  that  there  is  no  valid
   appeal before the Tribunal, and  the  parties  must  take  such  further
   action to deal with the adjudicator's decision as they see fit.
                                                                       [pic]

                                                                  (chairman)
