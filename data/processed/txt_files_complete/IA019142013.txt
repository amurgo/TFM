                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Obhi, promulgated on 5th April 2013, in which the appellant's
        appeal against the refusal of the Secretary of State  to  vary  her
        leave to remain was dismissed.  Judge  Obhi  also  found  that  the
        Secretary  of  State's  contemporaneous  removal   direction   made
        pursuant to section 47 Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act  2006
        was not in accordance with the law.  This  latter  finding  is  not
        challenged by either advocate and is in accordance with the law  as
        it stood at the date of the hearing.  A  lawful  removal  direction
        therefore remains outstanding.



Background


     2. The appellant was born on 3rd October 1992 and  is  a  national  of
        India. Her immigration history shows that on the 18th November 2011
        she was granted leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  4
        (General) Student Migrant with  leave  valid  until  17th  February
        2016.  On 28th June 2012 her leave to  remain  was  curtailed  from
        27th August 2012.


     3. On 16th July 2012 the appellant  made  a  further  application  for
        leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student
        Migrant. She was awarded the  required  30  points  for  Attributes
        based upon a valid CAS, but no points in  respect  of  maintenance.
        The  refusal  letter  dated  10th  January  2013  states  that  the
        appellant was required to show she had  �1,600  available  together
        with any outstanding course fees for the first year, although  this
        latter element had been paid in full. She was therefore required to
        show she was in possession of  �1,600  for  a  consecutive  28  day
        period to meet the requirements set out in paragraph 1A Appendix  C
        of the Immigration Rules. That 28 day period ran from the 19th June
        2012 to 16th July 2012 although the bank  statements  submitted  in
        support of the application only showed �1154.28 on 30th June  2012.
        It was found therefore that she was unable to meet the requirements
        of the Rules.


     4.  The  appellant  appealed  and  before  Judge  Obhi  produced   the
        documentary evidence she sought to rely upon, in addition to  which
        submissions were made by Mr Gill  following  the  appellant's  oral
        evidence. The Judge found that the funds in the account  could  not
        meet the minimum  required  maintenance  levels  for  the  required
        period in relation to the account provided by her uncle  Mr  Dalbir
        Singh held with the Punjab National Bank, although the  Judge  also
        noted this evidence was not acceptable in any event. The  appellant
        also provided details of another account with the  Punjab  National
        Bank, not disclosed with the application, in the joint names of her
        uncle and his wife which showed that  they  held  a  fixed  deposit
        account containing a sum in excess of �10,000 since 19th June  2011
        which, if admissible, would demonstrate that the appellant had  the
        required level of funding.


     5. Judge Obhi considered the requirements set out in Appendix C of the
        Rules which must be met if an individual wishes to rely upon  funds
        in a joint account or in the name of another. The  Judge  noted  in
        particular that the appellant must be named on the joint account as
        one of the account holders or other criteria set out  in  paragraph
        13 of Appendix C met.


     6. Judge Obhi found that in order for the evidence in the name of  the
        appellant's uncle to be accepted the appellant would  have  had  to
        demonstrate that her uncle was her legal guardian by reference to a
        court document, as there was no provision in the  Rules  for  a  de
        facto guardian. There was no  such  evidence.  Accordingly  it  was
        found that as the evidence of the appellant and her uncle was  that
        the uncle had never been declared her legal guardian,  even  though
        he may have paid the  course  fees  and  provided  her  maintenance
        during the course, she was unable to meet the requirements  of  the
        Immigration Rules.




The Grounds



     7. The grounds  on  which  permission  to  appeal  was  sought  allege
        procedural unfairness in that  no  enquiries  were  made  with  the
        appellant to ascertain whether or not she had the  requisite  funds
        available elsewhere, from either her parents in India  or  her  own
        savings. The grounds also submit  that  as  Judge  Obhi  found  the
        decision of the respondent was not in accordance with the  law  the
        appeal should being remitted to the Secretary of State to allow the
        appellant to vary  her  application  and  provide  bank  statements
        acceptable under the Immigration  Rules.  It  is  also  alleged  no
        concerns were raised with her with regard to the Rules and  so  she
        was not aware the statements would not be accepted.


     8. The grounds refer to the case of Patel [2011] UKUT 00211 and allege
        that in that case where the  tribunal  allowed  an  appeal  on  the
        ground the decision was not fair taken fairly and not in accordance
        with the law it may be sufficient to direct any fresh  decision  is
        not make a period of  60  days  in  order  to  give  the  appellant
        reasonable opportunity to vary his application.


     9. It is also alleged that the requirement  of  fairness  require  the
        appellant to be given an opportunity to address grounds of  refusal
        which she did not know and could  not  have  known  about,  failing
        which the decision may be set aside as being contrary to  the  law.
        It was submitted that the appellant had no such opportunity  making
        the Judge's decision unfair under the common law principles.


    10. The appeal is opposed by the Secretary of State.



Discussion



    11. The submission  the  determination  should  be  set  aside  in  its
        entirety as a result of it being found the  removal  direction  was
        not in accordance  with  the  law  has  no  merit.  Two  appealable
        decisions were made one in relation to the refusal  to  vary  leave
        and secondly a section 47 removal  direction.  It  is  the  removal
        direction that is not in accordance with the law not the refusal of
        variation.


    12. Mr Gill's submission that the term guardian is a  loose  term  also
        has no merit as it is a term with distinct legal  meaning  in  this
        case as shown by the wording of paragraph 13 of  Appendix  C  which
        states that the funds are only available to an  applicant  if  they
        are held or provided by a member of either of the  three  specified
        classes, the second of which  the  applicants  parent(s)  or  legal
        guardian(s) and the parent(s) or legal  guardian(s)  have  provided
        written consent that their funds may be used by  the  applicant  in
        order to study in the UK.  It is clear that what is required is not
        a guardian in the de facto sense but rather a legal guardian  which
        must imply status recognised in law. There was no evidence that the
        uncle who has the necessary funds had or has such status.


    13. Mr Gill also argued that the same uncle  provided  funds  when  the
        appellant initially secured entry to the United Kingdom and so such
        sponsorship should  be  accepted/allowed  this  time  too.  It  was
        submitted  the  respondent  should  therefore  waive   the   formal
        requirements  of  the  Rules.   It  was  also  submitted  that  the
        appellant was a genuine  student  and  that  her  original  college
        closed through no fault of hers, which I find appears to have  been
        accepted as the chronology shows a curtailment of her leave on 28th
        June 2012 with effect from 27th August 2012 which is 60 days later,
        the period the appellant was granted to allow her to  find  another
        course which she did. There is therefore no merit in the  claim  of
        unfairness, as such a period should have been granted as per Patel,
        as it was.


    14. Judge Obhi clearly noted  the  presence  of  the  additional  funds
        available to the uncle  but  found  they  also  fell  foul  of  the
        requirements of Appendix C. Even if these were also funds  accepted
        by the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) in granting initial leave,  it
        was not shown that the Rules in force at that time were the same as
        those in force at the date of the refusal or that the acceptance of
        funds by an ECO meant  the  mandatory  requirements  in  the  Rules
        should be waived in relation to the later application.


    15. In relation to the argument the appellant should  have  been  given
        the chance to provide additional information the Rules clearly  set
        out  the  requirements  to  be  met  by  an  individual  making  an
        application for leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
        Migrant of which the appellant is deemed to have notice.  The  case
        of Rodriquez [2013] UKUT 00042 refers to a policy operated by  UKBA
        since August 2009 indicating  that  where  mandatory  evidence  was
        missing from an  application  an  applicant  should  be  given  the
        opportunity to provide this. It was said to UKBA has a  public  law
        duty to give effect to  this  policy  in  all  cases  to  which  it
        applies. Rodriquez is subject to an appeal to the Court  of  Appeal
        as it is said to be contrary to that Court's decision in  Alam  and
        Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ
        960 in which the Court of Appeal said that  the  exclusion  of  new
        evidence introduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
        2002 s.85A applied to all appeals made after the  date  that  s.85A
        was brought into force and, in any event, the policy referred to in
        that case has been withdrawn.


    16. The respondent's current position, as from 6th September  2012,  is
        to be found in paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules which  sets
        out specific circumstances in which the  Secretary  of  State  will
        refer back to an applicant for additional information.  It has  not
        been proved on the fact that this is such a case.


    17. The fact there is  a  funding  shortfall  identified  in  the  bank
        statements  initially  provided  with  the   application   is   not
        challenged in the grounds seeking permission to appeal or before me
        today.


    18. There was an attempt before the Tribunal to amend  the  grounds  of
        appeal by way of a reference to Article 8 of this does  not  appear
        in the original grounds of appeal and was not  relied  upon  before
        Judge Obhi.


    19. Having considered the submissions made,  the  requirements  of  the
        Immigration Rules, case law, and all the relevant evidence, I  find
        the appellant has failed to discharge the burden of proof upon  her
        to the required standard to show that the decision reached by Judge
        Obhi was not within the range of decisions she was entitled to make
        the evidence. I find it was. The  requirements  of  the  Rules  are
        clear; the Rules in force at  the  date  of  decision  contain  the
        Secretary of State's policy for seeking further information from an
        applicant which has not been shown to be applicable on these facts.


    20. A lawful removal direction will  have  to  be  made  which,  unless
        certified, may give the appellant a further right of appeal.


Decision

    21. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    22. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.
