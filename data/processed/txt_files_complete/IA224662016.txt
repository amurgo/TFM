                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
Appellant     Mr Bates (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent    Mr Abe (Legal Representative)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent in these proceedings was the appellant before the First-
    tier Tribunal. From hereon I have referred to the parties as they  were
    in the First-tier  Tribunal  so  that  for  example  reference  to  the
    respondent is a reference to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.

 2. The appellant, citizen of Nigeria, applied on March 11, 2015 for  leave
    to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  respondent   refused   this
    application on June 1, 2015 and the appellant appealed on June 16, 2015
    under section 82(1) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002.

 3. The appeal was  heard  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Colyer
    (hereinafter referred to as "the Judge") on March 14,  2016  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on March  17,  2016  he  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal to the extent that he remitted the matter back to the respondent
    to make a valid decision.

 4. The respondent appealed that decision on the ground there was no  power
    to remit and permission to appeal was granted by Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Davidge on August 11, 2016.

 5. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make no order now.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 6. Mr Bates indicated that there was a clear error in law in light of  the
    decision of Greenwood (No.2) (para 398 considered) [2015]  UKUT  00629.
    The Tribunal in that appeal made it  clear  that  the  power  to  remit
    matters back to the respondent went following the  amendments  made  to
    the 2002 Act by the Immigration Act 2014.

 7. Mr Bates accepted the Judge had the power to send the  matter  back  to
    the respondent under section 86 of the 2002 Act (as amended) where  the
    tribunal concluded that the  respondent's  decision  under  appeal  was
    unlawful and the tribunal did not substitute  another  decision.  Where
    the respondent's decision involved a determination  of  an  application
    made by the litigant and a lawful decision remains to be made then  the
    Judge should clearly state that in his decision but he must  not  state
    the case is being remitted because that power no longer exists.

 8. Mr Abe indicated that he agreed with the proposed course of action.




    DECISION

 9. There was a material error as the Judge had no power to remit a  matter
    to the Secretary of State for a valid decision to be taken.

10. I set aside the Judge's decision and I remake that decision.

11. I allow the appellant's appeal to the extent that I declare there is no
    valid decision and the Secretary of State is required to make  a  fresh
    decision.
