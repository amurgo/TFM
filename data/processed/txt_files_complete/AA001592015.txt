                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr T Hussain, instructed by Halliday Reeves Law Firm
For the respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, MR, date of birth 18.4.84, is a citizen of Iran.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Dickson promulgated 6.3.15, dismissing his appeal against the  decision
    of the Secretary of State to refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection
    and human rights claims and to remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard
    the appeal on 18.2.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Davidge  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    31.3.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chamberlain granted permission to
    appeal on 3.7.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Dickson should be set aside.

 6. Judge Dickson found that the appellant had not established that he is a
    genuine convert to Christianity so as to give any risk on return,  nor,
    relying on SB (Iran), any risk on return on the basis of illegal exit.

 7. I note that the grounds of appeal raise no challenge to the credibility
    findings  concerning  Christian  conversion,  but  challenge  only  the
    findings that the appellant would not be at risk on return to  Iran  as
    having left illegally and returning as a failed asylum  seeker.  It  is
    asserted that even if he did not leave Iran illegally, his return as  a
    failed asylum seeker  creates  sufficient  risk.  The  grounds  do  not
    particularise the basis of this challenge,  beyond  general  assertions
    that people who are detained and perceived to be or actually are  anti-
    government, whether actively  involved  in  politics  or  not,  can  be
    subject to persecution.

 8. In granting permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Chamberlain  considered  it
    arguable there was an error of law in the judge's failure  to  consider
    the risk on return as a failed asylum seeker, given the evidence relied
    on to that effect by the appellant.

 9. The Rule 24 reply, dated 14.8.15, submits that the grounds are no  more
    than a mere disagreement with the findings,  even  though  the  adverse
    credibility findings  are  not  challenged,  and  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to follow SB (Iran) which held that an applicant would not  be
    at risk solely for being a failed asylum seeker.

10. In his submissions to me, Mr Hussain suggested that the  appellant  had
    relied on new country material postdating SB  (Iran),  which  justified
    departure from that authority. However, as is clear from �36 and �45 of
    the decision, the judge found as a fact  that  the  appellant  did  not
    leave Iran illegally and did not ever come to the adverse attention  of
    the Iranian authorities, although it was accepted that he left Iran and
    travelled to Greece. The judge concluded, "the appellant would  not  in
    my view attract the slightest interest of the authorities  in  Iran  on
    his return."

11. Given the adverse credibility finding of fact in  relation  to  illegal
    exit, the only viable issue is whether the judge erred  by  failing  to
    consider a risk on return as a failed asylum  seeker,  irrespective  of
    his credibility.

12. SB (Iran) held that Iranians facing enforced return do not  in  general
    face a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment. It is clear that this
    would encompass those returning as a failed asylum seeker. The Tribunal
    held, "That remains the case even if they exited Iran illegally. Having
    exited Iran illegally is not a significant risk factor, although if  it
    is the case that a person would face difficulties with the  authorities
    for other reasons, such a history could be a factor adding to the level
    of difficulties he or she is likely to face."

13. I have carefully considered the objective material in  the  appellant's
    bundle submitted to the First-tier Tribunal, particularly  in  relation
    to any parts that may bear on a risk to failed asylum seekers.

14. The material relied on by the appellant included evidence from  Amnesty
    International, quoted in the COIS at 31.17,  and  in  turn  quoting  an
    unnamed judge to the effect that asylum  seekers  are  interrogated  on
    return, whether or not they have been political activists  in  Iran  or
    abroad. Returnees are held for a few days until  it  is  clear  to  the
    police that they have not been involved in political activity and  have
    not done or said anything that  could  damage  the  reputation  of  the
    Islamic Republic, then they are released. It  is  also  suggested  that
    failed asylum seekers could be prosecuted for  making  up  accounts  of
    alleged persecution.

15. Even if there was an error of law  in  the  failure  of  the  judge  to
    address the specific risk of return as a failed asylum seeker, I am not
    satisfied that such an error could be material to the  outcome  of  the
    appeal on its particular facts.

16. However, I do not accept the submission that the  evidence  relied  on,
    referenced in the grounds of  application  for  permission  to  appeal,
    demonstrates that merely the act of  making  an  asylum  claim  can  be
    perceived as a political act against the Iranian government. The nature
    of the asylum claim must be relevant to the concern of the  authorities
    as to damage to the reputation of the Islamic Republic. Mr Hussain  did
    not establish how the nature of this appellant's  failed  asylum  claim
    would put him at risk. I accept that in Farshad Kiani Deh Kiani v  SSHD
    [2002] UKAIT 01328, it is not necessary to be a member of  a  political
    party or supporter of any political group, to show that persecution  is
    on the basis of political opinion. However,  the  individual  concerned
    must have  views  about  the  government  that  puts  him  at  risk  of
    persecution for that reason.  No  such  political  views  are  held  or
    expressed by this appellant.

17. This appellant's claim relied on Christian conversion and did not  rely
    on any an actual or imputed political opinion, and thus has nothing  to
    fear in this regard, the judge having specifically found that he  never
    came to the attention of the Iranian authorities, for any  reason,  and
    did not have any interest in Christianity whilst in Iran and no genuine
    interest after leaving Iran. Much of the grounds and the evidence cited
    in support make reference to the risks to a failed asylum seeker  based
    on actual or imputed political  opinion,  which  circumstances  do  not
    relate to this appellant; to stretch that material to  suggest  that  a
    false and rejected asylum claim on the grounds of Christian  conversion
    comes into the same category or class is a  stretch  too  far  and  not
    supported by the materials submitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions:

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order. However, given the circumstances, I make  an
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
