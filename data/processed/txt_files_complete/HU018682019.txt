Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Masood, Counsel for Trent Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan, has permission to  challenge  the
    decision of Judge Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal  dated  2  August
    2019.  The appellant had made a human rights claim and  in  a  decision
    dated 18 January 2019 the respondent  refused  this  on  the  principal
    basis that it was contrary to paragraph 276D of the  Immigration  Rules
    because it did not meet the requirements  of  paragraphs  276B(ii)  and
    276B(iii) with reference to paragraph 322(5) due to his  character  and
    conduct.  The respondent noticed that in his interview in October  2016
    the appellant was asked about his previous  application  for  leave  to
    remain based on claimed earnings �56,933.80 for tax year 2012/2013  and
    why this figure differed from the HMRC  record  �27,499  for  the  same
    year.  The respondent recorded that the appellant had stated that  when
    he was filing his tax returns he asked the accountant in 2016 to review
    the figures and the accountant found omissions in 2013 and that alarmed
    him as he did not know about it and he asked his accountant to  rectify
    the errors and to submit the correct tax returns to HMRC.

2.   The respondent considered that his  responses  to  questions  regarding
    the discrepancy in his  earnings  did  not  credibly  explain  why  his
    declaration of earnings was considerably lower than given in his Tier 1
    (General)  Migrant  leave  to  remain  application.    The   respondent
    considered his claim that his accountant found omissions in 2013  which
    he was then asked to rectify lacking in credibility as it was  only  in
    April 2016 that these figures were revised.  The respondent stated that
    it was the appellant's legal responsibility in regard to  the  accuracy
    of tax returns submitted to HMRC and therefore the respondent  did  not
    accept that he would solely rely on his accountant to file  and  submit
    tax declarations  on  his  behalf.   Furthermore,  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had retrospectively declared these claimed earnings  to  HMRC
    after such a long period did not satisfy the respondent that he had not
    previously been deceitful or dishonest in his dealings with HMRC and/or
    UKVI.

3.   The respondent was not satisfied that the  self-employed  earnings  the
    appellant had  declared  in  his  previous  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant
    application was consistent with his declarations made to  HMRC  in  the
    relevant tax period.  It was considered  that  there  would  have  been
    clear benefit to himself either by failing to declare his  earnings  to
    HMRC  with  respect  to  reducing  his  tax  liability  or  by  falsely
    representing his earnings to UKVI to enable  him  to  meet  the  points
    required to obtain leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant.  The respondent went on to consider whether in light
    of the declaration of different amounts of income,  his  character  and
    conduct was undesirable and that he should  be  refused  under  general
    grounds set out in paragraph 322(5)  to  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    respondent stated that whilst a paragraph  322(5)  refusal  was  not  a
    mandatory decision, he  considered  that  the  appellant's  actions  in
    declaring different incomes  would  mean  that  a  refusal  under  this
    provision was appropriate.

4.   The appellant appealed.  The appeal came before Judge Chambers  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal who in a decision dated 2 August 2019 dismissed the
    appellant's appeal against the refusal of 18 January 2019.   The  judge
    noted at paragraph 2 that the appellant had submitted further  evidence
    including a bundle with some  277  pages.   Having  set  out  the  main
    principles established by the Court of  Appeal  in  Balajigari   [2019]
    EWCA Civ 673 the judge set out his findings at paragraphs 9 to 20.   At
    paragraph 16 the judge considered that the very significant gap between
    what was actually earned and what was declared was such as could not be
    a slip-up or error or oversight on  the  part  of  the  appellant,  and
    certainly not on the part of his  accountants.   The  judge  stated  in
    paragraph 17 that the appellant could not have  failed  to  notice  the
    very significant discrepancy amounting to some  tens  of  thousands  of
    pounds in the appropriate tax for the relevant years.  At paragraph  18
    the judge noted that although the appellant had corrected  his  returns
    with HMRC, if he had not earned the amount in the first place  then  he
    could not in any way have met the earnings threshold  at  the  relevant
    time of his earnings based application.  The judge noted it was  agreed
    by the appellant there was something in the region of over  �25,000  in
    respect of recalculated  tax  liabilities  due  from  him.   The  judge
    considered that the appellant had not met the requirements of paragraph
    276B, and at paragraph 20 stated  that  it  was  established  that  the
    appellant's actions in declaring different amounts of  income  to  HMRC
    and UKVI were dishonest  and  rendered  it  undesirable  to  allow  the
    appellant to remain in the United Kingdom  with  the  result  that  the
    refusal under paragraph 322(5) was the appropriate response.

5.   The appellant's grounds identify eight separate  heads.   They  clearly
    overlap considerably but submit in essence that  the  judge  failed  to
    consider all the relevant circumstances and failed to take into account
    or evaluate the appellant's third bundle of  documents,  in  particular
    the  expert  accountant  report   from   Protax   Chartered   Certified
    Accountants.  It was submitted further that the  judge  had  failed  to
    take into account the appellant's explanation for the errors  that  had
    occurred.  I heard submissions from both representatives.  I shall  not
    rehearse their details except to say that they were succinct  and  well
    proposed.

6.   I am persuaded that the  judge  materially  erred  in  law  in  several
    respects.

7.   First, although stating that he had taken into account the  appellant's
    evidence at paragraph 2 and referring later on at one point  to  having
    considered "all the circumstances" (paragraph 18), there is nothing  to
    indicate that the judge engaged with the Protax  report  and  also  the
    further  complaints  the  appellant  had  made  against  his   previous
    accountant.  Mr  McVeety  submits  that  the  appellant  was  wrong  to
    describe the report from Protax as an expert report.  I  see  merit  in
    that submission, but it remains that  it  was  a  report  by  certified
    accountants and it needed to be considered by the judge and weighed  in
    the balance.  There is nothing to indicate that the judge engaged  with
    its contents at all.

8.   Secondly, although the judge does refer in at least one respect to  the
    appellant's explanations for the discrepancies, on analysis  the  judge
    did not take proper account of their contents.   In  paragraph  16  the
    judge said that if there was error on the part of the  accountants  and
    discrepancies had  occurred  "the  mechanism  for  that  error  is  not
    explained".  That  is  an  incorrect  description  of  the  appellant's
    further evidence which, inter alia, pinpointed a  particular  error  in
    relation to investment income.  In  paragraphs  17  and  18  there  are
    apparent references to the appellant's explanation that in light of the
    actual  mechanisms  for  the  error  set   out   in   the   appellant's
    documentation it cannot be said that the explanations were incapable of
    explaining the appellant's failure to recognise that the figures  given
    by his accountants were false.  At the very least, the judge needed  to
    say  why  he  considered  the  detailed  explanations  given  were  not
    credible.

9.   Thirdly, despite citing Balajigari the judge appears not to have  taken
    account of the approach set down in that case for consideration of  the
    application of paragraph 322(5).  At paragraph 34 Underhill LJ sets out
    that the first stage  of  the  analysis  under  this  paragraph  is  to
    consider whether the evidence  is  reliable;  whether  it  demonstrates
    sufficiently reprehensible conduct; and whether

         "(iii)   an assessment,  taking  proper  account  of  all  relevant
             circumstances  known  about  the  applicant  at  the  date  of
             decision, of whether his or her presence in the United Kingdom
             is undesirable  (this  should  include  evidence  of  positive
             features of their character)".


    Looking at the decision of the judge, I cannot see that there  was  any
    consideration of this further component of the first stage of assessing
    undesirability.  There is nothing to indicate that the judge considered
    any factor other than the  perceived  dishonesty  in  relation  to  the
    discrepant declarations to HMRC on the one hand, and UKVI on the other.
     That is inconsistent with the guidance given in Balajigari.

10.  Fourthly, the Court of Appeal in Balajigari identified a  second  stage
    of assessment or analysis, it being stated by Underhill LJ at paragraph
    39 that the  Secretary  of  State  must  separately  consider  whether,
    notwithstanding  the  conclusion  that  it  was  undesirable  for   the
    applicant to have leave to remain, there were factors  outweighing  the
    presumption that leave should for that reason be refused.  This  second
    stage has specific regard to the  fact  that  paragraph  322(5)  is  in
    discretionary terms.  There is no indication that the judge  considered
    the exercise of this  discretion  at  all.   The  respondent's  refusal
    decision letter did  refer  to  this  discretion  (see  my  summary  at
    paragraph 4 above); and in that context it is  just  possible  that  at
    paragraph 20 the judge may have had this discretionary element in  mind
    when he stated  that  the  refusal  under  paragraph  322(5)  was  "the
    appropriate response".  However, the judge made no  assessment  of  the
    issue regarding undesirability and the discretionary element or, if  he
    did, he simply reduced the entire analysis to the sole issue of alleged
    dishonesty,  without  considering  whether  there  were  any   positive
    features.

11.  For the above reasons I conclude that the decision of  the  judge  must
    be set aside for material error of law.

12.  Both parties were in agreement that if I found any  material  error  of
    law the appropriate step in a case of this type would be to remit it to
    the First-tier Tribunal in Manchester.  It will be  important  when  it
    returns to the First-tier Tribunal that the relevant judge  pays  close
    regard to the guidance given in Balajigari.  By  the  same  token,  the
    appellant's representatives must be prepared to explain  in  much  more
    precise and coherent fashion what it  considered  were  the  mechanisms
    (did they relate solely to investment income?) that led  the  appellant
    to fail to realise that  his  original  accountant  was  inflating  his
    income.

No anonymity direction is made.
