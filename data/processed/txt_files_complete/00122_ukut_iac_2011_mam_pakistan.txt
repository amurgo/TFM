Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mrs. J. Heybroek,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by
                       Morgan Mark Solicitors
For the Respondent:                    Mr. J.  Gulvin,  Senior  Home  Office
                 Presenting Officer.


It is wrong to allow an appellant's appeal simply on  the  basis  that  some
findings of fact are made in his favour, when those findings do not  entitle
him to further leave to remain in the capacity sought under the  Immigration
Rules. In such a case, the appeal should be dismissed under the  Immigration
Rules.








                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



1.    The Appellant appeals against the determination of  Immigration  Judge
     K E Gordon promulgated on 23 September 2010. The  terms  in  which  the
     Immigration Judge disposed of the appeal potentially raises an issue of
     jurisdiction. At the end of her determination,  the  Immigration  Judge
     said:

      "5.   I allow the appeal to the extent identified above".

2.    The question which arises in  this  particular  case  is  whether  the
     Immigration Judge had allowed the appeal, and if so,  whether  she  had
     only allowed  it  to  some  limited  extent,  or  whether,  on  a  true
     construction of her  determination  and  reasoning,  she  had  in  fact
     dismissed the appeal. If the Immigration Judge allowed the appeal, even
     if only in part, there is  potentially  an  issue  as  to  whether  the
     Appellant had a right to appeal against the determination.

3.    The appeal before the  Immigration  Judge  was  an  appeal  against  a
     decision of the Respondent of 28 June 2010 to  refuse  the  Appellant's
     application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1
     (General) Migrant under the points based system. The Respondent was not
     satisfied that the Appellant was entitled  to  the  40  points  he  had
     claimed under Appendix A of the Statement of Changes in the Immigration
     Rules HC 395  (as  amended)  (the  Immigration  Rules)  in  respect  of
     previous earnings. In order to achieve 40 points, it was necessary  for
     the Appellant to establish that his previous earnings for the  relevant
     period  of  assessment  were  between  �35,000  and  �39,999.  As   the
     Respondent was not satisfied that the Appellant had sufficient previous
     earnings to achieve 40 points, she was also not satisfied that  he  was
     entitled to 5 points in respect  of  UK  experience.  Accordingly,  the
     Respondent refused the application under  245C(c)  of  the  Immigration
     Rules.

4.    At paragraph 4 of the determination, the  Immigration  Judge  referred
     to the Appellant's documentary evidence and then said that it  was  not
     reasonably possible to tell the income from the invoices and  that  she
     considered that the  income  proven  was  �31,848.27,  which  she  said
     entitled him to 30 points under Appendix A. This is  then  followed  by
     paragraph 5, which we have quoted above, where  the  Immigration  Judge
     said that she allowed the  appeal  to  the  extent  she  had  indicated
     earlier (at paragraph 4).

5.     On  14  December  2010,  Senior  Immigration  Judge   Poole   granted
     permission to appeal, stating that the substantive grounds  challenging
     the Immigration Judge's assessment of the documentary  evidence  as  to
     the Appellant's previous earnings were arguable but he also  raised  in
     his decision the possibility  that  the  Appellant's  right  to  appeal
     against a determination which had been "allowed" may be restricted.

6.    In our judgment, the Immigration Judge did not  allow  the  appeal  to
     any extent. In order to succeed in his appeal,  the  Appellant  had  to
     show that he was entitled to 40 points in respect of previous  earnings
     and 5 points in respect  of  UK  experience.  A  finding  that  he  was
     entitled to something less than that meant that he had  in  truth  lost
     his appeal. On any view, it cannot be said he had  won  his  appeal  to
     some extent, however limited. It was wrong to allow his  appeal  simply
     on the basis that some findings of fact were made in his  favour,  when
     those findings did not entitle him to further leave to  remain  in  the
     capacity sought  under  the  Immigration  Rules.  Accordingly,  in  our
     judgment, the Immigration Judge should have stated in the determination
     that the appeal was dismissed, and not that  it  was  "allowed  to  the
     extent identified above". Given  that  the  true  construction  of  the
     determination was that the appeal had  been  dismissed,  there  was  no
     issue as to whether the Appellant had a right  to  appeal  against  the
     determination. The error of the Immigration  Judge  in  describing  her
     decision as a decision to allow the appeal to some limited extent could
     not deprive the Appellant of the right he had (on a  true  construction
     of the determination) to appeal against her determination. Accordingly,
     strictly speaking, the question as to  whether  there  is  a  right  of
     appeal against a determination which does allow an appeal in  part  did
     not arise in this case and will have to be left to another day.

7.    At the hearing, Mr. Gulvin conceded that  the  Immigration  Judge  had
     materially erred in law in her assessment of the  documentary  evidence
     as to previous earnings and  that  we  should  proceed  to  remake  the
     decision on the evidence before us. He accepted  that  the  documentary
     evidence before us established that the Appellant's  previous  earnings
     for the relevant period of  assessment  were  a  little  in  excess  of
     �35,000, which meant that he should have  been  awarded  40  points  in
     respect of previous earnings and 5 points in respect of UK  experience.
     We agree. It follows that the Appellant's appeal must be allowed.

Decision

8.    The making of the previous decision on the appeal involved the  making
     of an error on a point of law such that it falls to be  set  aside.  We
     have remade the decision. Our decision is that the  Appellant's  appeal
     against the Respondent's decision  is  allowed  under  the  Immigration
     Rules.
