                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination
        of First-tier Tribunal Judge Cope, promulgated on 16th May 2014, in
        which he allowed  the  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  an  Entry
        Clearance Officer (ECO) to grant the above Respondent entry to  the
        United Kingdom for the purposes of settlement as a spouse.


     2. The date of the decision is the 3rd September 2013.  The only  live
        issue before the First-tier  Tribunal  was  whether  the  financial
        requirements of the Rules were met.


     3. In paragraph 31 of his determination the  Judge  records  that  the
        Presenting Officer, whilst  not  conceding  the  point,  implicitly
        accepted that the appropriate documentation required under Appendix
        FM-SE had been produced in  relation  to  employment  with  Genting
        Casino from  which  the  sponsor  earns  �10,206.   The  Presenting
        Officer did, however,  take  issue  as  to  whether  claimed  self-
        employed earnings  of  �9,053  for  the  tax  year  2012-2013  were
        reflected in the personal bank statements of the accounts  held  by
        the  sponsor  with  Barclay's  Bank  PLC  and  whether  there   was
        corroboration in the form of the necessary income tax returns.


     4. The sponsor's evidence was that his earnings as  a  driver  and  in
        relation to the rent he received from allowing three other  drivers
        to use his taxi, was largely paid in cash although one driver  paid
        the money directly into his bank account.  Some  of  the  cash  was
        used to buy petrol rather than  paying  the  money  into  his  bank
        account which was found to be plausible by the Judge,  as  was  the
        fact that income can vary enormously on a  weekly  or  daily  basis
        depending on the hours worked. The Judge found that having examined
        the bank account of the sponsor, whilst the deposits were variable,
        they did not "seem to be out of line" with the level of income  the
        sponsor has claimed [38].


     5. In relation to the income tax  returns  the  Judge  questioned  the
        extent to which these can be expected to corroborate claimed levels
        of income in these circumstances  [39]  and  found  that  what  the
        sponsor has to show is that it is more likely  than  not  that  his
        documents such as the tax  returns  accurately  reflect  his  gross
        earnings from self-employment for the tax  year  2012-13  [40].  In
        paragraph 41 the Judge sets out his key finding which is:


     41.  Taking in account  into  account  all  the  documentary  evidence,
     together with the oral  evidence  of  the  sponsor,  and  applying  the
   standard of proof, I am satisfied then that  he  had  shown  that  it  is
   more likely than not that  he  meets  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM
   in the sense  of  having  provided  the  necessary  documentary  evidence
   specified in Appendix  FM-SE  to  show  that  he  had  earned  �9,053  in
   2012-13,  thus  taking  his   total   earnings   from   employment   with
   Genting  Casinos  and  his  taxi  business  to  over  �18,600  for   that
   financial year.


     6. The Judge concluded that the requirements of paragraph E-ECP-3.1 of
        Appendix FM were met and on this basis allowed the appeal.


     7. The Judge also went onto comment on  the  decision  of  Mr  Justice
        Blake in R (on the application of MM) [2013] EWHC 1900 and  to  the
        fact an appeal against this decision was pending before  the  Court
        of Appeal. The Judge criticised the approach of the ECO in relation
        to this judgment which has now been  overturned  by  the  Court  of
        Appeal in any event.


     8. Permission to appeal was sought by the ECO on the  basis  that  the
        Rules of specified evidence are comprehensively set out in Appendix
        FM-SE. The Tribunal, whilst acknowledging this, have had no  regard
        to this in the determination where it sets out its findings on this
        issue, especially in regard to the  evidence  of  income  from  the
        sponsor's self-employment.  It is also asserted the Tribunal failed
        to address the relevant evidence  required  in  the  form  of  bank
        statements demonstrating  deposits  which  corroborate  the  second
        income the sponsor claimed to earn and that the Tribunal  proceeded
        to speculate about the nature of the taxi  business  and  the  fact
        that most in this field of work dealt exclusively in cash payments,
        which meant it was still unclear as to what  the  actual  level  of
        income was that the sponsor received from his  self-employment.  It
        is asserted that it is not clear what the  sponsor's  actual  gross
        income  was  at  the  date  of  application   and   therefore   the
        requirements of the Rules could not be found to be met.



Error of law


     9. Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules sets out the way in which  the
        Secretary of State  believes  specified  applications  have  to  be
        assessed and, in relation to the financial criteria, the  mandatory
        specified documents that must be produced to prove such income.


    10. The income earned by the sponsor from the casino  appears  to  have
        been accepted on the basis it was evidenced by specified documents.
         The income from the taxi business was not proved by the production
        of specified documents as the Judge relied upon the  oral  evidence
        of sums received together with  his  own  personal  knowledge  from
        dealing with cases involving taxi drivers to support the incomplete
        documentation.   In Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v
        Abdi [1994] Imm AR 402 Steyn  LJ  at  page  420  accepted  that  an
        Adjudicator  was  entitled  to  rely  on  matters  within  his  own
        knowledge, provided such matters were disclosed to the  parties  so
        as to afford them a fair opportunity to deal with them.   That  was
        also the view in HA and TD v SSHD (2010) CSIH 28.


    11. No procedural error is asserted in relation to this case as  it  is
        accepted that the Judge did put the parties to notice and therefore
        provide them with the ability to comment upon this element  of  the
        case.


    12. The relevant section of Appendix FM is E-ECP, which in relation  to
        the financial requirements states:


         Financial requirements
         E-ECP.3.1. The applicant must provide specified evidence, from the
sources listed in          paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of-

         (a) a specified gross annual income of at least-

              (i) �18,600;
              (ii) an additional �3,800 for the first child; and
              (iii) an additional �2,400 for each additional child; alone
or in combination with

         (b) specified savings of-

              (i) �16,000; and
              (ii) additional savings of an amount equivalent to 2.5 times
the amount which is             the difference between the gross annual
income from the sources listed in                paragraph E-ECP.3.2.(a)-
(d) and the total amount required under paragraph E-           ECP.3.1.(a);
or

         (c) the requirements in paragraph E-ECP.3.3.being met.

              In this paragraph "child"  means  a  dependent  child  of  the
applicant who is-

              (a) under the age of 18 years, or who was under the age of  18
years when they            were first granted entry under this route;

              (b) applying  for  entry  clearance  as  a  dependant  of  the
applicant, or has limited           leave to enter or remain in the UK;

              (c) not a British Citizen or settled in the UK; and

              (d) not an EEA national with a right to be admitted under  the
Immigration (EEA)               Regulations 2006.

         E-ECP.3.2. When determining whether the  financial  requirement  in
paragraph EECP.

         3.1. is met only the following sources will be taken into account-

         (a) income of  the  partner  from  specified  employment  or  self-
employment, which, in      respect of a partner returning  to  the  UK  with
the  applicant,  can  include  specified              employment  or   self-
employment overseas and in the UK;

         (b) specified pension income of the applicant and partner;

         (c)  any  specified  maternity  allowance  or  bereavement  benefit
received by the partner in          the UK;

         (d) other specified income of the applicant and partner; and

         (e) specified savings of the applicant and partner.

         E-ECP.3.3. The requirements to be met under this paragraph are-

         (a) the applicant's partner must be receiving one or  more  of  the
following -

         (i) disability living allowance;
         (ii) severe disablement allowance;
         (iii) industrial injury disablement benefit;
         (iv) attendance allowance;
         (v) carer's allowance; or
         (vi) personal independence payment; and

         (b) the applicant must provide evidence that their partner is  able
to maintain and            accommodate themselves,  the  applicant  and  any
dependants adequately in the UK         without recourse to public funds.

         E-ECP.3.4. The applicant must provide evidence that there  will  be
adequate               accommodation, without recourse to public funds,  for
the family, including other family      members who are not included in  the
application but who live in the same household,       which the  family  own
or occupy exclusively: accommodation will not be regarded as        adequate
if-

         (a) it is, or will be, overcrowded; or

         (b) it contravenes public health regulations.



    13. The provisions within the Appendix relating to the  nature  of  the
        documentary evidence required to prove the alleged income are to be
        found that Appendix FM-SE which state:


         Appendix FM-SE - Family members - specified evidence

         Family Members - Specified Evidence



         A. This Appendix sets out the specified  evidence  applicants  need
to provide to meet         the requirements of rules contained  in  Appendix
FM and, where those requirements        are also contained  in  other  rules
and unless otherwise stated, the specified  evidence        applicants  need
to provide to meet the requirements of those rules.

         B. Where evidence is not specified by Appendix  FM,  but  is  of  a
type covered by this        Appendix,  the  requirements  of  this  Appendix
shall apply.

         C. In this Appendix references to paragraphs are to  paragraphs  of
this Appendix unless       the context otherwise requires.

         D. (a) In  deciding  an  application  in  relation  to  which  this
Appendix states that specified      documents must be  provided,  the  Entry
Clearance Officer or Secretary of State ("the         decision-maker")  will
consider documents that have been submitted with the            application,
and will only consider  documents  submitted  after  the  application  where
     sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies.

         (b) If the applicant:

              (i) Has submitted:

              (aa) A sequence of documents and some of the documents in  the
sequence have              been omitted (e.g. if one bank statement  from  a
series is missing);

              (bb) A document in the wrong format; or

              (cc) A document that is a copy and not an  original  document;
or

              (ii) Has not submitted a specified document,

         the decision-maker may contact the applicant or his  representative
in writing or              otherwise, and request  the  document(s)  or  the
correct version(s). The material             requested must be  received  by
the UK Border Agency or Border Force at the address       specified  in  the
request within a reasonable timescale specified in the request.

         (c) The decision-maker will not request documents where he  or  she
does not anticipate        that addressing the error  or  omission  referred
to in sub-paragraph (b) will lead to a       grant because  the  application
will be refused for other reasons.

         (d) If the applicant has submitted:

              (i) A document in the wrong format; or

              (ii) A document that is a copy and not an original document,

          the  application  may  be  granted  exceptionally,  providing  the
decision-maker is satisfied         that  the  document(s)  is  genuine  and
that the applicant meets  the  requirement  to  which          the  document
relates. The decision-maker reserves the  right  to  request  the  specified
     original document(s) in the correct format  in  all  cases  where  sub-
paragraph (b) applies,          and to refuse applications if this  material
is not provided as set out in sub-paragraph      (b).

         (e) Where the decision-maker is satisfied that  there  is  a  valid
reason  why  a  specified           document(s)  cannot  be  supplied,  e.g.
because it  is  not  issued  in  a  particular  country  or        has  been
permanently lost, he or  she  may  exercise  discretion  not  to  apply  the
      requirement  for  the  document(s)  or  to  request   alternative   or
additional information or       document(s) be submitted by the applicant.

         (f) Before making a decision under Appendix FM  or  this  Appendix,
the   decision-maker           may   contact   the   applicant   or    their
representative  in  writing  or   otherwise   to   request           further
information or documents. The material requested must be received by the  UK
         Border Agency or Border Force  at  the  address  specified  in  the
request within a           reasonable timescale specified in the request.



    14. Paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE is also relevant which states:


              7. In respect of self-employment in the UK as a partner, as  a
sole trader or in a             franchise  all  of  the  following  must  be
provided:

              (a) Evidence of the amount of tax  payable,  paid  and  unpaid
for the last financial              year.

              (b) The latest:

                  (i) annual self-assessment tax return to HMRC (a copy or
print-out);
                  (ii) Statement of Account (SA300 or SA302); and,
                  (iii) the same for the previous financial year if the
latest return does not                  show the necessary level of gross
income, but the average of the last 2                 financial years does.


              (c) Proof  of  registration  with  HMRC  as  self-employed  if
available.

              (d) Each partner's Unique Tax Reference  Number  (UTR)  and/or
the UTR of the             partnership or business.

              (e) Where the person holds or held a  separate  business  bank
account(s), bank           statements for the same 12-month  period  as  the
tax return(s).

              (f) personal bank statements for the same 12-month  period  as
the  tax  return(s)                showing  that  the  income   from   self-
employment has been paid into  an  account  in            the  name  of  the
person or in the name of the person and their partner jointly.

              (g) Evidence of ongoing self-employment  through  evidence  of
payment of Class 2              National Insurance contributions.

              (h) One of the following documents must also be submitted:

                  (i) (aa) If the business is required to produce annual
audited accounts, the               latest such accounts; or
                  (bb) If the business is not required to produce annual
audited accounts, the               latest unaudited accounts and an
accountant's certificate of confirmation,                 from an
accountant who is a member of a UK Recognised Supervisory
Body (as defined in the Companies Act 2006);
                  (ii) A certificate of VAT registration and the latest VAT
return (a copy or                   print-out) confirming the VAT
registration number, if turnover is in excess of                   �73,000;
                  (iii) Evidence to show appropriate planning permission or
local planning                  authority consent is held to operate the
type/class of business at the trading                 address (where this
is a local authority requirement); or
                  (iv) A franchise agreement signed by both parties.

                       (i) The document referred to  in  paragraph  7(h)(iv)
must be provided if                     the organisation is a franchise.



    15. This is the framework of the Rules  against  which  the  Judge  was
        required to assess the merits of the appeal and it  is  clear  from
        the Judge's findings that the mandatory evidence  required  by  the
        Rules was not provided.


    16. Mr Latif argued that this appeal turned upon the interpretation  of
        the wording of the section  as  all  the  relevant  documents  were
        provided and, in any event, paragraph 7 (f)  is  discretionary.   I
        find no merit in this submission as subject to  the  provisions  of
        any guidance to the contrary it appears the provisions of  Appendix
        FM-SE  are  mandatory.  Mr  Latif  relies  upon   the   Immigration
        Directorate Instructions (IDI) for July 2014, notwithstanding  this
        is an appeal against a decision of an  ECO,  although  it  was  not
        suggested the guidance did not reflect the position appertaining at
        the date of decision.  Paragraph 9.3.7 of the IDI states:


              Self-employed income can be cash in hand if the correct tax is
   paid. In line           with paragraph 3.1.5 of this guidance,  it  would
   generally be expected that            the person's business  or  personal
   bank statements would fully reflect all            gross  (pre-tax)  cash
   income. Flexibility may only  be  applied  where  the            decision
   maker  is  satisfied  that  the  cash  income  relied   upon   is   fully
   evidence to by the relevant tax return(s) and the accounts information.


    17. Paragraph 3.1.5 of the IDI states:


              Under paragraph 1 (n) of Appendix FM-SE the  gross  amount  of
   any cash            income may be counted where  the  person's  specified
   bank statements              show the net amount  which  relates  to  the
   gross amount shown  on  their            payslips  (or  in  the  relevant
   specified evidence provided in  addition  to  the               specified
   bank    statements    in    relation    to    non-employment     income).
   Otherwise, only the net amount shown on  the  specified  bank  statements
     may be counted.


    18. The same guidance makes  clear  that  there  is  no  discretion  or
        flexibility regarding the level of the financial  requirement  that
        must be met as it is  a  matter  of  public  policy  to  operate  a
        financial  requirement  based  on  minimum  income  thresholds  for
        sponsorship of partners and children  which  must  be  clearly  and
        consistently applied in all cases, and that  an  applicant  has  to
        demonstrate and evidence the income/savings required  to  meet  the
        level of financial requirement relevant to the application.


    19. It was conceded by Mr Latif that the bank statements  provided  did
        not reflect all the monies allegedly received by the sponsor but it
        was also submitted that most  of  those  paid  in  were  reflected;
        although he had not examined the deposits and nor had he worked out
        the mathematical realities so as to support this  statement  either
        now or before Judge Cope.


    20. It was accepted that the casino income was as claimed  as  evidence
        was provided in relation to the same that met the  requirements  of
        Appendix FM-SE.  The further  submission  from  Mr  Latif  that  as
        paragraph 7 (f) did not define 'income' and that if it was required
        that an individual should show all the  monies  they  received  the
        rule should say so, is noted but does not assist  his  client.  The
        wording of this provision is clear, namely that the  personal  bank
        statements for the same 12 month period as  the  tax  returns  must
        show that the income from self-employment is paid into  an  account
        indicating that it is intended that all income earned is  required,
        otherwise how can a decision maker be satisfied that  the  relevant
        tax return and account information fully evidence the claimed  cash
        income. Had the intention of the author of the  provision  intended
        only part income could be declared the wording of  the  rule  would
        not doubt have said so. All the income is required to be  reflected
        in the account and it is not. The use  of  cash  to  pay  for  fuel
        rather than banking it would be reflected in the accounts where the
        total income and expenditure would be declared and verifiable,  but
        that is not the case on the basis of the information made available
        in this appeal. In such a case paragraph 9.3.7 of the  IDI  may  be
        relevant. The burden in a cash business case is for  the  appellant
        to prove that the correct level of tax  has  been  paid  which,  in
        turn, requires accurate evidence relating to the total gross income
        received and tax computation.


    21. The admission by Mr Latif that he  did  not  know  the  exact  cash
        figure or the total income received from the self-employment  is  a
        fair summary of the evidence that was  before  the  Judge.  If  the
        total cash figure is not known one questions how  the  Judge  could
        have found that this figure combined with the casino income enabled
        the sponsor to demonstrate that the required minimum level had been
        shown to exist. The Rules do  not  permit  such  a  leeway  on  the
        available evidence.


    22. I find the Judge erred in failing  to  adopt  a  proper  structured
        approach to this issue, even though he was  clearly  aware  of  the
        legal requirements. The Judge's finding in paragraph 41 that it was
        "more likely than not" that the sponsor met the requirements of the
        Rules appears to  be  a  finding  based  upon  the  Judges  overall
        personal impression of the evidence as to the  level  of  available
        income, including oral evidence, rather than assessing  that  level
        of evidence by reference to the mandatory  required  documentation.
        The discretion set out in the IDI in  paragraph  9.3.7  allows  the
        degree of flexibility in relation to cash in hand business but only
        if the correct level of income tax has been  paid  and  the  income
        upon which such tax is being assessed is fully declared in relevant
        tax returns and the accounts information.  This  evidence  was  not
        before Judge Cope and was not in existence at the date of decision.


    23. I therefore find that the Judge has materially erred  and  set  the
        determination  aside.  The  situation  before  the  Upper  Tribunal
        remains as it was before Judge Cope  and  accordingly  I  find  the
        Appellant has failed to discharge the burden of proof upon her,  to
        the  required  standard,  to  show  she  is  able  to  satisfy  the
        requirements  of  Appendix  FM  based  upon  a  failure  to  adduce
        specified evidence to prove that the level of available  income  is
        sufficient to meet  the  mandatory  minimum  requirement  contained
        within the Rules.


    24. I note with interest the conclusions in relation to the fee  award,
        in which Judge Cope made no such award on the basis it appeared the
        sponsor failed to provide with the application for entry  clearance
        all the specified  documentation  required  by  Appendix  FM-SE  to
        establish that he met the necessary minimum financial requirements,
        which remained the position before the Judge at the hearing.


    25. If the mandatory information is now available a  fresh  application
        can be made.

Decision

    26. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    27. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
