                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this  appeal  but
    in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in
    the First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Scobbie promulgated  on
    18 November  2014  which  allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

Background

 3. The Appellant was born on  10  February  1991  and  is  a  national  of
    Afghanistan.

 4. On 25 June 2014 the Appellant applied for leave to remain as a  Tier  4
    Student Migrant under the Points  Based  System  and  for  a  Biometric
    Residence Permit.

 5. On  9  July  2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application and made directions for his removal under section 47 of the
    Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.  The  refusal  was  by
    reference to  paragraph  245  ZX(h)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  which
    provides that if the proposed course of study is below degree level the
    grant of leave to remain must not lead to the  applicant  having  spent
    more than 3 years in the United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  4  student.  The
    refusal stated that the Appellant had previously been granted leave  to
    study below degree level for a period of 1 year and 10 days and as  his
    proposed course was 1 year 11 months and 29 days in duration this would
    take him above 3 years of study below degree level.

The Judge's Decision

 6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Scobbie ("the Judge") allowed the appeal against the Respondent's
    decision. The Judge found :

      a) He considered a letter dated 22 July 2014  from  Bradford  Regional
         College in which they confirmed that the finishing date in the  CAS
         was incorrect and should have read 7 June 2016 not 6 July 2016.

      b) He found that he was entitled to take the letter  into  account  by
         reference to Section 85A(4) (d) of the Nationality, Immigration and
         Asylum Act 2002.

      c) Therefore the total period of study was less than three years.

 7. Grounds of appeal were lodged on the basis that on the dates as set out
    in the Judges decision the period of study was still over 3  years  and
    on 7 January 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Frankish gave permission to
    appeal.

Discussion

 8. Mr Shilliday indicated that he had  not  seen  a  copy  of  the  letter
    referred to in paragraph 12 of the decision but based on the  dates  in
    paragraph 12 of the decision, 7 June 2014- 7 June 2016  the  period  of
    study was exactly two years and therefore the total period of study was
    in excess of the three years allowed by the Rule.

 9. I indicated that in writing the decision the Judge had apparently  made
    a typographical error in that although he relied  on  the  letter  from
    Bradford College the start date given in the letter  was  7  July  2016
    (not 7 June) and the finish date was 6 June 2016. That was a period  of
    700 days which is 1 year 10 months and 30 days. I retired to  allow  Mr
    Shilliday an opportunity to  consider  the  letter  and  calculate  the
    period in issue.

10. Mr Shilliday provided me with a  printout  from  timeanddate.com  which
    confirmed the period as set out above.. He did not  seek  to  make  any
    further submissions

Finding on Material Error

11. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law.

12. This was an appeal against a refusal of leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4
    student that was refused because the proposed period of study based  on
    the CAS that the Appellant provided with  the  application  would  have
    resulted in a total period of study at undergraduate level in excess of
    3 years which is not permitted by  the  Rules.  The  Appellant  it  was
    agreed had previously been granted leave to study for  a  period  of  1
    Year and 10 days.

13. The Judge who dealt with this case on  the  papers  had  before  him  a
    letter dated 22 July 2014 which he was prepared to  consider  from  the
    sponsoring college, Bradford Regional College, which the Respondent had
    not seen which confirmed that there had been an error in  the  original
    CAS and that the start date for the Appellant's course was 7 July  2014
    and the finish date was 6 June 2016. This was therefore a period of 700
    days and would have meant that the aggregate period of study was  below
    three years.

14. In writing his decision the Judge made an  error  in  the  decision  at
    paragraph 12 and gave the dates of study as 7 June 2014 and finish date
    as 7 July 2016 and it was on the basis of those dates, not having  seen
    the letter  from  the  College,  that  the  Respondent  challenged  the
    decision.

15. Therefore while the Judge made a factual error,  had  he  recorded  the
    dates correctly he would have been entitled  to  reach  the  conclusion
    that he did which was that the total period  of  study  was  less  than
    three years.

CONCLUSION

16. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

17. The appeal is dismissed.
