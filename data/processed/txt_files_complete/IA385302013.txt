Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because  the
case involves protection issues. I find that it is appropriate  to  continue
the order. Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
appellant is  granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.  This
direction applies both to the appellant and to the  respondent.  Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    The  appellant  entered  the  UK  on  27  September  2012  with  entry
    clearance as a student. The respondent curtailed his leave to remain on
    03 June 2013 after his Tier 4 sponsor withdrew sponsorship due to  non-
    attendance. On 02 August 2013  the  appellant  claimed  asylum  and  an
    initial screening interview was carried out. On 27 August 2013  he  was
    interviewed in detail  about  his  reasons  for  claiming  asylum.  The
    appellant  claimed  that  he  was  a  member  of  ISO  (Imamia  Student
    Organisation), a Shia religious organisation. He claimed  that  members
    of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (a banned Sunni group) shot him in November  2008.
    He feared that he would be at risk  from  this  group  if  returned  to
    Pakistan.

2.    The respondent refused the application in a notice of  decision  dated
    31 August 2013. It is not necessary to set out the reasons for  refusal
    for the purpose of this decision. On  appeal  the  appellant  raised  a
    further reason for fearing to return to Pakistan on the ground  of  his
    sexual orientation. The appeal was  adjourned  for  the  respondent  to
    consider the issue but was  eventually  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Malins ("the judge") on 20 January 2015.

3.    The judge found that there was no evidence to show that the  appellant
    had ever intended to study in the UK and concluded  that  this  damaged
    his credibility. She rejected the appellant's  claim  that  he  was  an
    active member of ISO in Pakistan. In the alternative she found that the
    appellant had failed to produce sufficient evidence  to  show  that  he
    would be at risk from Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in any event. The core  of  the
    appellant's original claim was rejected. However, the judge went on  to
    consider whether the appellant had produced evidence to show that, as a
    gay man, he would be a risk if returned to Pakistan. The judge accepted
    that he is "a practicing homosexual" who had been able to  conduct  his
    private life in Pakistan in the way that he  wanted  without  suffering
    past persecution. She concluded that he would  be  able  to  return  to
    Pakistan and live his life as he did before without any risk and  found
    that he could reasonably  be  expected  to  tolerate  any  restrictions
    (although the judge found that there was no credible evidence  that  he
    was so restricted in this case). The judge dismissed the appeal.

4.    The appellant applied for permission to appeal  the  decision.  On  15
    October 2015 Upper Tribunal Judge Pinkerton found that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision involved the making of an error of law. The fact that
    the appellant had not suffered past  persecution  did  not  necessarily
    indicate that he would not be at risk on return. The judge  had  failed
    to evaluate the background evidence, which indicated that  there  might
    be a risk of discrimination, harassment and violence  in  circumstances
    where it was possible that a person  could  not  seek  effective  state
    protection.  The First-tier Tribunal decision was  set  aside  and  the
    appeal listed for further hearing in order to remake the decision.



Decision and reasons

5.    The issue for determination  in  this  appeal  has  been  narrowed  to
    consideration of the risk on return  for  reasons  of  the  appellant's
    openly gay sexual orientation. The appellant did not seek to  challenge
    the First-tier Tribunal findings on the political aspect of the  claim.
    The  First-tier  Tribunal's  credibility  and  factual   findings   are
    preserved. The submissions made at the hearing concentrated largely  on
    the background evidence relating to Pakistan.

Legal Framework

6.    The relevant legal framework was  summarised  by  Lord  Roger  in  the
    Supreme Court decision in HJ (Iran) v SSHD [2011] 1AC 596:

         "82.     When an applicant applies for asylum on the  ground  of  a
         well-founded fear of persecution because he is  gay,  the  tribunal
         must first ask itself whether it is satisfied on the evidence  that
         he is gay, or  that  he  would  be  treated  as  gay  by  potential
         persecutors in his country of nationality.

         If so, the tribunal must then ask itself whether it is satisfied on
         the available evidence that gay people who lived  openly  would  be
         liable to persecution in the applicant's country of nationality.

         If so, the tribunal must go on  to  consider  what  the  individual
         applicant would do if he were returned to that country.

         If the applicant would in fact live openly and thereby  be  exposed
         to a real risk of persecution, then he has a well-founded  fear  of
         persecution  -  even  if  he  could  avoid  the  risk   by   living
         "discreetly".

         If, on the other hand, the tribunal concludes  that  the  applicant
         would in fact live discreetly and so avoid persecution, it must  go
         on to ask itself why he would do so.

         If the tribunal concludes that the applicant would choose  to  live
         discreetly simply because that was how he  himself  would  wish  to
         live, or because of social pressures, e g, not wanting to  distress
         his parents or embarrass his friends, then his  application  should
         be rejected. Social  pressures  of  that  kind  do  not  amount  to
         persecution and the Convention does not  offer  protection  against
         them. Such  a  person  has  no  well-founded  fear  of  persecution
         because, for reasons that have nothing  to  do  with  any  fear  of
         persecution, he himself chooses to adopt a way of life which  means
         that he is not in fact liable to be persecuted because he is gay.

         If, on the other hand,  the  tribunal  concludes  that  a  material
         reason for the applicant living discreetly on his return would be a
         fear of the persecution which would  follow  if  he  were  to  live
         openly  as  a  gay  man,  then,  other  things  being  equal,   his
         application should be accepted. Such a person  has  a  well-founded
         fear of persecution. To reject his application on the  ground  that
         he could avoid the persecution by living  discreetly  would  be  to
         defeat the very right which the Convention exists to protect -  his
         right to live freely and openly  as  a  gay  man  without  fear  of
         persecution. By admitting him to asylum and allowing  him  to  live
         freely and openly as a gay man without  fear  of  persecution,  the
         receiving state  gives  effect  to  that  right  by  affording  the
         applicant a surrogate for the protection from persecution which his
         country of nationality should have afforded him."

7.    In X, Y and Z v Minister voor Immigratie en Asiel  [2014]  3  WLR  770
    the Court of Justice  of  the  European  Union  considered  the  proper
    interpretation  of  Article  9  of  the  Qualification  Directive.  The
    applicants came from countries where homosexual acts are  criminalised.
    The court noted that the right to respect for private and  family  life
    under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights  was  not  a
    fundamental right from which  no  derogation  is  possible.  The  court
    concluded that the mere fact that there  is  in  existence  legislation
    criminalising homosexual acts does not affect an applicant in a  manner
    so significant that it reaches the minimum level of  severity  required
    to constitute persecution within the meaning of Article 9(1) [55].  But
    a term of imprisonment that accompanies a legislative  provision  would
    be capable of constituting an act of persecution "provided that  it  is
    actually applied in the country of origin" [56]. The court went  on  to
    state that, in considering whether a protection claim is  well-founded,
    the national authorities should undertake an assessment of the relevant
    facts concerning the applicant's country of nationality "including  its
    laws and regulations and the manner in which they are applied" [58].

Background evidence relating to Pakistan

8.    I was referred to the most recent Home Office Country Information  and
    Guidance ("the CIG report") "Pakistan: Sexual  orientation  and  gender
    identity" (dated 14/07/14). At paragraph  1.3.4  the  respondent  makes
    reference to a European Court of Justice decision ([2013]  WLR(D)  427,
    [2013] EUECJ C-199/12)  but  does  not  give  the  full  citation.  The
    references in fact refer to the decision in X,Y & Z. The appellant does
    not dispute the fact that homosexual acts are criminalised in  Pakistan
    and accepts that the evidence shows  that  prosecutions  are  rare.  No
    argument is put forward that the appellant would be at risk solely as a
    result of criminalisation. The guidance contained in the CIG report  is
    as follows:

         "1.3.5   Lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGBT) persons in  Pakistan  can
                be subject to societal and state discrimination,  harassment
                and violence and, depending on the facts of the case,  would
                not  be  able  to  seek  effective   protection   from   the
                authorities.

         1.3.6    Transgender persons (hijras) are often rejected by society
                and  experience  discrimination,  intimidation  and   abuse,
                despite being granted equal rights as Pakistani citizens  by
                the Supreme Court in 2012.

         1.3.7    Same-sex sexual acts are illegal in  Pakistan.  The  Penal
                Code does not explicitly refer  to  homosexuality.  However,
                'carnal  intercourse  against  the  order  of  nature'  (see
                paragraph 2.2.2) is punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment
                for a period of two years  to  life.  The  Hudood  Ordinance
                provides punishment for sodomy  and  extra-marital  sex.  In
                practice the authorities rarely prosecute cases, but  police
                use the laws for harassment and extortion.

         1.3.8    LGBT persons from privileged backgrounds enjoy some degree
                of openness and some level of acceptance from  their  family
                and close friends provided they live  discreetly,  but  this
                does not cover the vast majority of the population and  most
                same-sex relationships tend to  remain  secret  due  to  the
                social stigma attached.

         1.3.9    Gay rights activists and other persons who openly campaign
                for gay rights in Pakistan would be at real risk  from  non-
                state  societal  actors  and  would  not  be  able  to  seek
                effective protection from the authorities.

         1.3.10   LGBT persons would not  generally  be  able  to  seek  and
                obtain effective protection  from  the  state  against  acts
                perpetrated against them by non-state actors.

         1.3.11   Given that homophobic attitudes are  prevalent  throughout
                the country, there is unlikely to be any place  in  Pakistan
                to which an LGBT person could safely relocate without making
                fundamental changes to their behavior.

         1.3.12   If an individual  chooses  to  live  discreetly  to  avoid
                persecution then, following HJ (Iran), they are a refugee."

9.    The CIG report goes on to outlined the source material for the  policy
    statements made in the early part of the report. At paragraph 2.2.6:

         "2.2.6   The President of Neengar Society [an NGO promoting  rights
                for LGBT  person  and  religious  minorities]  stated  that,
                although Section 377 and 294 laws were rarely enforced, they
                were 'used to threaten and blackmail  people.  Since  social
                stigma and discrimination against  LGBT  community  is  more
                severe in  Pakistan,  police  and  other  community  members
                threaten the members of LGBT community that they  will  have
                them arrested and thrown in jail.' The President of  Neengar
                Society stated that LGBT  people  are  mostly  arrested  for
                extortion purposes and that cases may be altered  after  the
                police are bribed. The IGLHRC concurred, stating that police
                raids on gay "cruising areas" may be a "common  phenomenon,"
                but charges are rarely pressed  as  it  is  common  for  the
                police to be bribed with money or sexual favours."

10.   The CIG report goes on to cite various pieces of evidence relating  to
    the treatment and attitude of the state authorities in Pakistan:

         "2.3.1   According to the US State  Department  2013  Human  Rights
                Report for Pakistan, gay men and  lesbians  rarely  revealed
                their sexual orientation. Systematic discrimination  against
                lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons  was  widely
                acknowledged privately, but insufficient  data  existed  for
                accurate reporting on these forms of discrimination, due  in
                part to severe societal stigma and fear of recrimination for
                those who come forward.

         2.3.2    The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada  (IRBC)  noted
                in January 2014 that the IGLHRC country  advisor  considered
                that, if an LGBT person who faced  threats  from  family  or
                community members went to the police, that the  police  'may
                become  an  accomplice  rather  than  protector.'  The  IRBC
                further reported that 'According to the President of Neengar
                Society,  incidents  of  threats  or  violence  from  family
                members against LGBT people are usually unreported  and  are
                resolved within the family; there  is  usually  an  unspoken
                agreement that no one will involve the police, and  an  LGBT
                person will not report incidents, even if  they  are  "badly
                beaten".'  The BBC indicated that LGBT issues  were  usually
                addressed within the family.

         ...

         2.3.4     A  representative  of   the   Women   Employees   Welfare
                Association (WEWA) reported, in 2011, that discrimination by
                the state of Pakistan  against  LGBT  persons  is  "encoded,
                institutionalized and enforced",  due  to  legal  provisions
                that criminalise same-sex relationships, and the  fact  that
                there were no laws prohibiting discrimination on  the  basis
                of sexual orientation. The WEWA added that LGBT persons were
                not accepted legally or socially at either local or national
                levels,  and  their  rights  were  infringed  within   daily
                existence, employment and education."

11.   In relation to wider societal attitudes and treatment of  LGBT  people
    the CIG report contains the following relevant passages:

         "2.4.1   The Immigration and Refugee Board of  Canada  reported  in
                January  2014  that,  according  to   Inter-Press   Service,
                Pakistan's "conservative Muslim society" views homosexuality
                as a sin. According to a survey conducted by the Washington-
                based Pew Research Center published in June 2013, 87 percent
                of respondents in Pakistan said that homosexuality should be
                rejected by society. The IRBC further noted that,  according
                to several sources, gay men and  lesbians  are  rarely  open
                about their sexual orientation and that "it is difficult for
                a member of the LGBT community to  access  housing,  a  good
                job, or health care without concealing  their  sexuality  or
                taking extra precautions with  a  fear  of  discrimination."
                According to the Neengar Society President, LGBT  people  in
                Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, and elsewhere in  Pakistan  have
                been subject to violence and "no one can openly claim to  be
                gay or lesbian in Pakistan as it can still cost  them  their
                life to announce their sexuality in  public".  According  to
                the IGLHRC country advisor, LGBT people in these cities  are
                commonly subject to harassment  and  psychological  violence
                from within or outside the family.

         2.4.2    Several sources consulted by the Immigration  and  Refugee
                Board of Canada reported that the gay community in  Pakistan
                is "underground" and same-sex relationships tend to remain a
                secret due to  the  social  stigma  attached.  Although  the
                notion of being gay is taboo, in some circles it is possible
                to have a gay social life provided it is "discreet and under
                the radar", particularly in more affluent urban communities,
                but for LGBT Pakistanis who are poor, not well-educated, and
                lack internet access it is difficult.

         2.4.3    The President of Neengar Society stated that social  media
                groups and organised  meetings  in  larger  cities  such  as
                Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad, do exist  for  LGBT  persons;
                however, this culture exists only among  the  more  socially
                and intellectually elite classes of Pakistan, and there  are
                no openly gay communities in these cities.  Neengar  Society
                provides an  emergency  shelter  to  LGBT  people  who  face
                threats or exclusion. According to the President of Neengar,
                there were a total of 70  LGBT  people  seeking  shelter  in
                2013; of these, 10 were lesbians, five were transgender  and
                55 were gay or bisexual men.

12.   The CIG report then goes on to highlight evidence that  discusses  the
    cultural context in which gay and bisexual men, in particular, live:

         "2.4.4    The  Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  of  Canada  (IRBC)
                reported that, according to various media sources, Pakistani
                society and families expect men  to  get  married  and  have
                families regardless of sexual orientation. According to  The
                Post, in September 2012, a man in Karachi was killed because
                of his sexual orientation; acid was thrown on his  face  and
                other body parts and he was shot twice. In April  2014,  The
                Express Tribune reported on the murder of three gay  men  in
                Lahore by a father of two, who said he wanted to 'send out a
                message about the "evils" of  homosexuality.'  According  to
                the IGLHRC country advisor, young men or boys that  identify
                as gay typically face expulsion from the family home if they
                do not relinquish their sexual orientation."

13.   I was also referred to a report prepared by Landinfo,  an  independent
    country of origin information centre based in  Norway.  The  report  is
    titled "Pakistan: Homosexuals and homosexuality"  (03  May  2013).  The
    summary of the report is as follows:

         "This  report  examines  the  legal  framework  related  to  sexual
         relationships  between  persons   of   the   same   sex   and   its
         implementation in Pakistan, as well as general  societal  attitudes
         towards  homosexuality   and   the   authorities'   protection   of
         homosexuals. Sex between men is illegal, both according to law  and
         religion. No civil rights legislation exists to  protect  gays  and
         lesbians from discrimination.

         In  Pakistan,  as  in  many  other   gender-segregated   societies,
         homosocial  behaviour  is  considered  normal  and  homosexual  sex
         between men  is  widespread  and  accepted  under  a  condition  of
         discretion and secrecy; everybody  knows  what  is  going  on,  but
         nobody talks about it.

         At the same time the  general  climate  for  sexual  minorities  is
         hostile, and a person who comes forward as a homosexual  will  risk
         sanctions from the family, societal isolation, legal  problems  and
         violence."

14.   The Landinfo report is consistent in  saying  that  there  are  a  low
    number of reported prosecutions under the criminal  code.  Prosecutions
    usually involve cases where adults have abused minors. Where the law is
    enforced it tends to be directed towards cases where abuse  occurs  and
    not towards voluntary sexual  relations  between  adults  of  the  same
    gender [3.2].  In common with the CIG report the Landinfo  report  also
    outlines  evidence  to  show  that  those  from  poorer  socio-economic
    backgrounds are generally more at  risk  of  harassment  and  extortion
    under threat of prosecution from the police. Paragraph 3.3 concludes:

         "Therefore, as Landinfo understands the  situation,  MSM  [men  who
         have sex with other men] do not have problems related  to  criminal
         prosecution. Those who are most visible in  public,  however,  risk
         being harassed by the police, a harassment that seems  to  be  both
         economically  and  sexually  motivated.  The  harassment   probably
         primarily affects persons  of  low  socio-economic  background  and
         hijra. The ban works as a basis for threats; threats which lead  to
         extortion."

15.   The Landinfo report goes on to discuss what is acceptable in terms  of
    interaction between the genders in Pakistan. While social and  physical
    contact  between  men  and  women,  especially   when   unmarried,   is
    unacceptable, the report makes clear that displays of affection between
    men is socially acceptable [4.2.1]:

         "On the other hand, persons of the same gender (most often men) can
         relatively openly display emotion to each other. In  Pakistan,  one
         can often see young boys who hold hands  and  act  in  a  way  that
         probably would be perceived as an expression  of  homosexuality  in
         Western countries. While women and men cannot even shake  hands  in
         many cases, it is not uncommon to see  men  who  almost  act  in  a
         courtship manner. When it comes to opportunities for persons of the
         same gender to show affection towards  each  other  in  public,  it
         seems that the relationship between intimacy and social  background
         is the opposite of what is the case for the same between women  and
         men. Hugging, holding hands and physical contact between men  seems
         to primarily be  prevalent  in  lower  socio-economic  layers.  The
         middle class and upper class, however,  have  adopted  the  Western
         notion  that  such  behaviour  may  be  indicative  of   homosexual
         attraction - which seems to be a trend in many  communities  around
         the world where showing  affection  towards  someone  of  the  same
         gender has traditionally been fine.

             The moderate sections of the upper and middle class have mixed-
             gender gatherings and young men from this  background  do  not
             hold hands as they are aware of the association this behaviour
             holds with homosexuality (IHEU 2008).

         IHEU  indicates  that  the  acceptance  of  affectionate  behaviour
         between men means that �It is very easy for homosexuals to disguise
         their relationship in this manner� (IHEU 2008)."

16.   The report goes on to state that gender segregation and  control  over
    women are likely to provide a partial explanation as to why sex between
    men "is relatively  widespread  and  tacitly  tolerated"  [4.2.2].  The
    report goes on to provide further evidence to support the statement:

         "It is probably relevant to understand this tolerance in  light  of
         that homosexual acts, in isolation, do not represent  a  threat  to
         the basic institution of  Pakistani  culture,  family.  A  stronger
         focus  on  stricter   levels   of   punishment   for   extramarital
         heterosexual intercourse (zina) than homosexual intercourse, may be
         a reflection of the same. The anthropologist Unni Wikan also points
         to the traditionally high degree of tolerance for homosexuality  in
         many Muslim societies, and this should be  seen  in  light  of  the
         uncompromising demand that women should be sexual pure and  chaste.
         Sexuality between men is considered a safety  valve  that  protects
         women (Landinfo 2012).

         The researcher Badruddin Khan  suggests  the  following  about  the
         background of a general tacit  tolerance  of  homosexuality  in  an
         interview on Queer Jihad:

             Private sexual conduct is really not a  big  issue.  In  fact,
             from a pragmatic point of view, it is probably  better  for  a
             young man to have sex with other men before  marriage  than  a
             woman, since the only  women  available  would  presumably  be
             prostitutes (Khan, n.d.)."

17.   The Landinfo report goes on to conclude:

         "There is no room for exposure  of  a  gay  identity  in  Pakistan.
         Landinfo believes that  this,  as  with  the  tacit  tolerance  for
         homosexual acts, can be seen in the  light  of  ruling  family  and
         marriage  traditions.   Unlike   homosexual   acts,   homosexuality
         represents a permanent threat to  marriage  and  reduces  a  family
         group's   opportunity   for   consolidation    through    marriage.
         Homosexuality carries a sense of and is in itself a source  of  the
         destruction  of  the  patriarchal  extended  family.  Homosexuality
         violates the Pakistani community's most important  institution  and
         it would probably be perceived as far more serious to come out with
         a homosexual identity than if homosexual acts  were  to  come  into
         public awareness." [5]

         "It is established above that persons of the same gender  can  live
         together, but if they have a homosexual relationship and it becomes
         known, they risk  serious  abuse,  according  to  both  sources  in
         Islamabad. Hina Jilani categorically established  that  it  is  not
         possible �to come out of the closet� in Pakistan, it  would  expose
         the person to risk of serious violence from private parties.  There
         is no empirical data available, so Jilani's viewpoint  is  regarded
         as a qualified assessment.  Landinfo  believes  that  there  is  no
         reason to question the assessment; the lack of  empirical  data  is
         probably a confirmation that it is correct.

         Landinfo also believes that it is reasonable  to  assume  that  the
         strongest reactions will come from the immediate family, because  a
         family member who is  characterised  as  homosexual  would  clearly
         weaken the family group's moral status and honour. As an  extension
         of homosexual acts having an element of  zina,  one  cannot  ignore
         that  publicly  known  homosexuality  within  a   traditional   and
         religiously conservative environment  would  represent  a  risk  of
         serious reactions. Risk of reactions and  the  seriousness  of  the
         reactions would probably vary along several  dimensions,  including
         geography,   religious/cultural   climate,    network,    political
         influence/power, economics and education, etc.

         It  is  furthermore  possible  that  other  parties  would   react,
         primarily conservative  religious  environments  which  could  take
         action and represent a threat of serious abuse." [5.1]

18.   There is other background evidence before the Tribunal but it was  not
    referred to in detail. In any event, it is in general accord  with  the
    evidence outlined above. Both parties asked me  to  assess  the  appeal
    based on the background evidence.

Conclusions

19.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted that the  appellant  is  a  gay
    man from Pakistan who has given  an  account  of  sexual  relationships
    conducted with several cousins and school mates  during  his  childhood
    and adolescent years. In light of this the judge concluded that it  was
    not possible that the appellant was not known to be gay when  he  lived
    in Pakistan. She concluded that the appellant was able to  conduct  his
    "homosexual activities" in Pakistan in the  way  he  wanted  without  a
    serious detriment to his private life. There was no  evidence  to  show
    that he had been persecuted in the past by friends or family or any one
    else in Pakistan.

20.   In order to assess whether the appellant would be at  risk  on  return
    his evidence must also be placed  in  the  context  of  the  background
    evidence outlined above. I have considered  his  witness  statement  in
    some detail. It is possible that he  may  have  been  able  to  conduct
    sexual  relationships  with  other  young  men  in   Pakistan   without
    attracting too much adverse attention. The  background  evidence  shows
    that sex between men is likely to be tolerated by  family  members  and
    wider members of the community. Sex  between  men  is  perceived  as  a
    sexual 'safety valve'  in  a  society  where  pre-marital  sex  between
    heterosexual couples is taboo.

21.   Nothing in the description of  the  appellant's  sexual  relationships
    with  young  men  in  Pakistan  suggests  that  they   developed   into
    relationships with an openly homosexual identity. The early  encounters
    that he had were as a young boy. The more serious relationship  he  had
    with a young man at college, who he wanted to marry,  ended  when  that
    young man refused to make the relationship open.  Consistent  with  the
    background evidence, his boyfriend Z told him that  he  would  marry  a
    girl that his parents had already found for him.  Even  in  the  UK  he
    found that his first boyfriend, who was also Pakistani,  wanted  to  be
    discreet about his sexuality. In light of the background evidence it is
    likely that this was a result  of  him  wanting  to  respect  Pakistani
    social mores because it would have been possible  to  conduct  an  open
    relationship in the UK without fear. At the date of the hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal the appellant said he  was  in  a  relationship
    with another man, who encouraged him to live openly  as  a  couple.  He
    says that they are well known  in  the  gay  community  in  London  and
    Manchester. He says that his new partner encouraged him to embrace  his
    sexuality rather than be ashamed of it.

22.   The evidence shows a  progression  in  the  appellant's  relationships
    over time. While  he  was  able  to  conduct  sexual  relationships  in
    Pakistan, and perhaps those relationships were known and  tolerated  by
    those who knew him, it is only since he came to the UK that he has been
    able to develop  a  relationship  with  an  openly  gay  identity.  The
    evidence shows that in the context of Pakistani culture  a  distinction
    can be made between 'homosexual  acts'  and  a  'homosexual  identity'.
    While sex between young men might be tolerated to a certain extent, the
    background evidence makes clear that core family  values  are  seen  to
    provide essential cohesion in Pakistani society. An openly gay identity
    is seen to threaten or undermine those core values. It is at this point
    that an openly gay man is likely to be at risk of ill-treatment ranging
    from discrimination, harassment or  violence  by  members  of  his  own
    family or other members of society.  The  CIG  report  recognises  that
    where an LGBT person is at risk they would not  generally  be  able  to
    seek and obtain effective protection from  non-state  actors  and  that
    internal relocation would not be  available  given  the  prevalence  of
    homophobic attitudes throughout Pakistan.

23.   In concentrating on the fact that  the  appellant  had  been  able  to
    conduct sexual relationships with other men in Pakistan the  First-tier
    Tribunal failed to appreciate that the mere fact of conducting a sexual
    relationship is not the same thing as being able  to  live  openly  and
    express a gay identity. While the former is tolerated to some extent in
    Pakistan the latter is seen as a threat to the core social values  that
    govern Pakistani society. The evidence  shows  that  if  the  appellant
    sought to live in Pakistan with an  openly  gay  identity  there  is  a
    reasonable degree of likelihood that this could place him at risk  from
    members of his family or from wider members of the community.  In  such
    circumstances effective protection would  not  be  available.  As  Lord
    Roger made clear it is "his right to live freely and openly  as  a  gay
    man without fear of persecution" that engages  the  protection  of  the
    Refugee Convention.

24.   For the reasons given above I conclude  that  there  is  a  reasonable
    degree of likelihood that the appellant would be at risk  of  treatment
    amounting to persecution for reasons of his membership of a  particular
    social group.
