                                                          DECISION AND
REASONS

1.    This is the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  to  the  Upper Tribunal,
brought with the permission of a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal,  from  a
decision of the First-tier Tribunal (hereinafter "the tribunal")  which  it
made following a hearing of 10 September 2018 and which  it  sent  to  the
parties on 19 September 2018; whereupon it allowed the  claimant's  appeal
from the Secretary of State's decision of 11 June 2018 refusing  to  grant
her international protection.

2.    The claimant was granted anonymity by the tribunal.  The tribunal  did
not explain why it was  doing  so  but  it  seems  to  me  one  of  its  key
considerations must have been a perceived need to  protect  the  privacy  of
the claimant's three minor  children.   Nothing  was  said  about  anonymity
before me but, in the circumstances, I have decided to maintain  the  status
quo and to continue the grant of anonymity.

3.    Shorn of all but essential detail, the  background  circumstances  are
as follows: The claimant, who was born on 19 October 1981, is a national of
Nigeria.  She has, as already noted, three minor children, two of  whom  are
male and one of whom is female.  She had made a previous unsuccessful  claim
for asylum but, in November 2017, submissions were sent to the Secretary of
State, on her behalf, seeking international protection on asylum grounds  on
the basis that if she were to be returned to Nigeria she would  be  at  risk
there at the hands of her former partner and that her daughter would  be  at
risk of being subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM).   The  Secretary
of State, however, did  not  believe  the  claimant  had  given  a  truthful
account and thought that neither of  the  risks  she  claimed  would  arise.
Further, the Secretary of State thought that there would  be  a  sufficiency
of protection and, even failing that, there would be the availability of  an
internal flight alternative within Nigeria.

4.    Unlike the  Secretary  of  State,  the  tribunal  concluded  that  the
claimant had given a credible account  of  events.   It  accepted  that  she
would be at risk at the hands of her former partner, that domestic  violence
was a widespread problem in Nigeria and that her daughter would be  at  risk
of being subjected to FGM.   The  tribunal  concluded  on  my  reading  (see
below) that there would not be a  sufficiency  of  protection  and  that  it
would be unreasonable or unduly harsh to expect the claimant and  her  three
children to relocate, as a family unit, within Nigeria.  As to all  of  that
it said this:

      "     33.  I find that her account is consistent  with  the  objective
      evidence  of  widespread  gender  discrimination  against  women   and
      ineffective enforcement of laws  preventing  domestic  violence.   The
      Home Office COI on Women in  Nigeria  Fearing  Gender-based  Harm  of
      Violence dated August 2016 recorded that  domestic  violence  against
      women is  widespread,  underreported  and  often  considered  socially
      acceptable.   Regardless  of  their  level  of  education  respondents
      indicated that they did not want to report cases of domestic  violence
      to the police citing police mishandling and cultural inhibition.   The
      US State Department Country Report noted that the police often refused
      to intervene into domestic disputes blamed the  victim  for  provoking
      the abuse.

            34.  Furthermore,  despite  requests  from  the  Appellant,  the
      Respondent has not provided any indication  about  [the  ex-partner's]
      immigration status.  Her account that he married a British  woman  and
      has children appears to be  borne  out  by  the  Cafcass  Safeguarding
      Letter  which  refers  to  enquiries  made  of  the  police  force  in
      Maidenhead where he was living that revealed that his ex-partner, with
      whom he has two children, had contacted the police in  2016  reporting
      that she was at risk of honour-based violence, and that she had  found
      out that he was already married with another family.  This  woman  had
      given information that he works as a healthcare professional.   Taking
      account of this, I find it reasonably  likely  that  he  had  acquired
      leave to remain in the  UK  and  therefore  can  travel  between  this
      country and Nigeria.

            35.  I accept that [the ex-partner] would become  aware  if  the
      Appellant and the children were returned to  Nigeria  because  of  the
      ongoing Children Act proceedings and  bearing  in  mind  his  previous
      violence and abuse I find that she would be at risk from him  and  his
      family if she is returned to Benin.   I  am  not  convinced  that  her
      daughter is at risk of  FGM;  the  Appellant  is  an  intelligent  and
      resourceful young woman and I would expect that  if  [the  ex-partner]
      and his family attempted to take the child or harm her that she  would
      put cultural sensitivities aside and avail herself of  the  protection
      from the authorities.  However, in the context of the family court  in
      this country having made an FGM Protection  Order,  and  applying  the
      lower standard of proof, I find that the Appellant's  daughter  is  at
      risk.

            36.  I do not accept that the  Appellant's  ex-partner  and  his
      family have the influence or power  to  trace  her  and  the  children
      wherever they may live in Nigeria.  There is no cogent  evidence  that
      he or his family have the means or ability to trace her throughout the
      vast  country  of  Nigeria.   Whilst  I  accept  that  it   would   be
      unreasonable for her to move to the Muslim north of  the  country  she
      has lived and worked in Lagos in  the  past  and  as  an  intelligent,
      educated woman I find that if she was returning by herself it would be
      reasonable for her to relocate within Nigeria.

            37.  However, she is responsible for three small  children,  and
      there is some evidence that her eldest son has already been  adversely
      affected by the problems between  his  parents.   I  must  give  prime
      consideration to the welfare of the children, although to some  extent
      this  is  an  academic  exercise  because   in   granting   2ï¿½ years
      discretionary leave to remain, the Respondent has  already  presumably
      accepted that EX.1 of the Immigration Rules  has  been  satisfied  in
      relation  to  the  eldest  child.   The  Appellant  has  been  out  of
      employment in Nigeria for many years and her license to practice as  a
      midwife has now lapsed.  I accepted that it would be hard for  her  to
      find work to support herself and the children.  The eldest  child  has
      now lived in the UK for over seven years and the two younger  children
      have known nothing other than life in the UK.  I accept  that  without
      family support it would be unduly harsh  for  the  Appellant  and  her
      children to internally relocate within Nigeria."

5.    The appeal was thus allowed.  But that was not the end of  the  matter
because the Secretary of State sought permission  to  appeal  contending  (I
paraphrase and  summarise)  that  the  tribunal  had  erred  through  making
inconsistent findings as to whether or not there would be a  sufficiency  of
protection for the claimant's daughter with respect  to  the  risk  of  FGM;
through failing to carry out a sufficiently  holistic  assessment  regarding
internal flight and instead focusing in that context only  upon  what  might
be in "the best interests of  the  children";  and  in  making  perverse  or
irrational findings.  The granting Judge relevantly said this:

      "     2.   The grounds assert that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made
      contradictory findings of fact, finding both that  there  would  be  a
      sufficiency of protection for the appellant on return in  relation  to
      the risk to her daughter of FGM and that she would nevertheless be  at
      risk.  It is argued that having found that the appellant would be able
      to avail herself of protection, the appellant should not be  found  to
      have a well-founded fear of persecution.  It is  further  argued  that
      the Judge applied  the  wrong  test  when  determining  that  internal
      relocation would be unduly harsh for the appellant.  It  is  submitted
      that the Judge looked at the best interests of the  children  and  the
      fact that they had leave to remain here rather than  focusing  on  the
      circumstances in Nigeria.  It is further submitted that the Judge made
      contradictory and irrational findings in relation  to  sufficiency  of
      protection and her ability to find employment on return.

             3.    It  is  arguable  that  the  First-tier Tribunal   make
      contradictory findings in relation to  sufficiency  of  protection  at
      [35] for the reasons set out in the grounds.   Whilst  the  Judge  was
      correct to consider the best interests of the children in  considering
      whether they could internally relocate I do not refuse  permission  in
      relation to the ground that the Judge's findings  on  internal  flight
      were contradictory."

6.    Permission  having  been  granted  there  was  a  hearing  before  the
Upper Tribunal (before me) so that  consideration  could  be  given  as  to
whether or not the tribunal  had  erred  in  law  in  making  its  decision.
Representation at that hearing was as stated above  and  I  am  grateful  to
each representative.  But the hearing was a short one.  Mr Diwnycz, for the
Secretary of State, said that he would  not  seek  to  go  beyond  what  was
stated in the  written  grounds.   He  did  not  seek  to  amplify  them  or
elaborate upon them.  He accepted that the  grounds  as  expressed  did  not
contain a challenge to the tribunal's conclusion that the  claimant  herself
would be at risk on  return.   I  did  not  find  it  necessary  to  trouble
Mr Dingley.

7.    As I informed the parties at the end of the hearing, I have  concluded
that the tribunal did not make an error of law.  I accept that paragraph 35
of the tribunal's written reasons (set  out  above)  could  have  been  more
clearly worded.  But it is necessary to read the tribunal's written  reasons
as a whole.  It clearly found at paragraph 35, notwithstanding any risk  to
the claimant's daughter, that the claimant  was  herself  at  risk,  at  the
hands of her former partner, on the basis that he had been  violent  towards
her in the past and would be so  again.   There  was  an  issue  as  to  his
location but the tribunal accepted that he would become aware of it  if  she
were to be returned to Nigeria and it must have been finding, though it  did
not say so in terms, that he would track her down.   The  tribunal  did  not
actually say, in terms, that  it  was  finding  the  authorities  would  not
provide her with a sufficiency of protection with respect to the  risk  from
the former partner.  But it can be inferred without  very  much  difficulty,
given what it  had  to  say  about  what  the  background  country  material
indicated, that there would not be such a  sufficiency  of  protection.   It
must have regarded that as being established from the matters  it  mentioned
at paragraph 33 such that it did not need to effectively repeat  itself  as
to that point at paragraph 35.  So, once that is realised, it  matters  not
whether what it said about the risk to the daughter or  the  sufficiency  of
protection from that risk to her was contradictory  or  not.   The  claimant
had succeeded herself irrespective of the position of her children.

8.    Additionally and in any event, whilst what the  tribunal  had  to  say
with respect to the availability of protection for the  claimant's  daughter
was somewhat unclear, I infer that what it was intending  to  say  was  that
there was a risk of her being subjected to FGM; she  would  in  response  to
such a risk seek the protection of the authorities  (which  is  not  to  say
that they would  afford  such  protection);  but  that  applying  the  lower
standard such protection would not be available.  But even  if  I  am  wrong
about that it does not matter because of what has been  found  with  respect
to the risk to the claimant.

9.    Moving on to the other grounds, I do  not  accept  that  the  tribunal
focused solely upon the interests of the children  when  assessing  internal
flight at paragraph 37 of its written reasons.   Its  consideration  as  to
internal flight was succinct but, nevertheless, sufficiently  holistic.   It
was open to it to take into account the difficulties  the  claimant  herself
would have in finding employment given that her licence  to  practice  as  a
midwife had lapsed and that she would have to combine  any  employment  with
the task of  supporting  and  looking  after  her  children.   That  was  an
important consideration.  It was open  to  the  tribunal  to  conclude  that
internal flight would be unduly harsh for the reasons it gave.   As  to  the
contention that the tribunal  had  made  perverse  or  irrational  findings,
Mr Diwnycz accepted that there was a high threshold  and  he  did  not,  in
fact, say anything by way of  seeking  to  persuade  me  that  it  had  been
reached in this case.  But anyway, I do not detect the difficulty  with  the
findings that is suggested in the grounds.  As  I  have  explained,  I  have
taken the  view  that  although  paragraph 35  as  expressed  is  a  little
confusing, what was said was not  contradictory  when  properly  understood.
The tribunal was not saying that the fact the claimant would  have  to  look
after her children when relocating to a  different  part  of  Nigeria  meant
that she would somehow lose her  skills  and  intelligence  which  would  be
relevant to her ability to seek employment.   Rather,  it  was  saying  that
notwithstanding her skills and intelligence the task of  finding  employment
would be more difficult through her having to  look  after  those  children.
There is nothing at all irrational or perverse about that.

10.   For the above reasons then, I have concluded  that  the  tribunal  did
not make an error of law.  Accordingly, the Secretary of State's  appeal  to
the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

Decision

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an error  of  law.   Accordingly,  its
decision shall stand.

The First-tier Tribunal granted the claimant anonymity.   I  continue  that
grant pursuant to  rule 14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper Tribunal)
Rules 2008.  No report of these proceedings shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify the claimant or any of her family members.  Failure to  comply  may
lead to contempt of court proceedings.
