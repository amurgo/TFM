                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr J Jones for the Secretary of State
Miss A Savage (counsel instructed by Perera & Co) for the asylum-seeker


      This is an appeal from a decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Mr  RA  Kay),
     sitting at Manchester on 20 August, allowing an appeal by  someone  who
     claimed to be a Bajuni citizen of Somalia, from directions for  removal
     as an illegal entrant on 20 January 2001.  The asylum-seeker  said  she
     had been born in Kismayu in 1962, and lived there till September  2000,
     when she left for Mombasa in Kenya: she arrived here, she  says,  on  4
     November.  Leave was given on the basis of whether the adjudicator  has
     taken proper account of the  background  evidence,  or  given  adequate
     reasons of his findings on the asylum-seeker's credibility.  The points
     on the facts concern the asylum-seeker's account of  her  origins,  and
     whether she is a Bajuni at all.  While we have to decide  them  on  the
     basis of the individual case before us, anything we  are  able  to  say
     which is of general application may  be  of  some  importance,  as  the
     appellate authorities have had, and go on having a considerable  number
     of cases before them involving contested claims of Bajuni origins.  The
     removal directions were set for Somalia, although the Home  Office  did
     not accept that the asylum-seeker came from thereat all.  At  one  time
     this might have been fatal to any meaningful disposal  of  the  appeal;
     but in the light of Hwez (CO-2090-01), it now has to be decided whether
     the asylum-seeker is a refugee as such.  If we uphold the  adjudicator,
     there will be no question of any removal directions applying;  if  not,
     then the present ones will no  longer  be  appropriate,  and  Mr  Jones
     undertook to withdraw them, for fresh ones to be issued.

  2. The adjudicator's findings of fact appear at � 37:

     I therefore have to make a finding of credibility bearing in  mind  the
     lower burden of proof which is required in these cases.  Given that she
     is an uneducated woman having ever been to  school  I  would  not  have
     expected her to understand  or  know  very  much  about  the  political
     situation in Somalia.  I also formed the view that for  this  Appellant
     it would not be unreasonable to expect that she would have very  little
     knowledge or understanding of the world around her.  I think  that  her
     life would revolve around her home and her children  and  her  husband.
     The suggestion is that she is not from Somalia but from  Kenya  because
     she only speaks Swahili which is the language  of  Kenya.   The  object
     evidence does seem to indicate  however  that  Kibajuni  which  is  the
     language she is supposed to speak as a  Bajuni  a  dialect  related  to
     Swahili.  Today she constantly referred to the fact that  Kibajuni  was
     the same as  Swahili  expect  for  a  different  pronunciation  and  or
     different colloquial term.  I find that she is credible.  I  find  that
     she is a citizen of Somalia and that she comes from Kisimayo  and  that
     she is a member of the Bajuni tribe.  I believe her story.   I  believe
     that her husband and her mother were killed and she was raped and I  am
     satisfied that she has a well founded fear of persecution if  she  were
     to return to Somalia.

  3. Clearly the asylum-seeker did know a certain amount about Somalia,  and
     in  particular  Kismayu  (as  it  most  often  spelt),  which  is   the
     southernmost coastal town, near the Kenya border.  We may assume  that,
     if the details she gave at her first interview about the  hospital  and
     roads there had been  wrong,  then  the  Home  Office  would  have  had
     something to say about it.  We can see for ourselves that at the second
     interview (Q50) she correctly gave the names of three of the other main
     tribes of Somalia.  She also, correctly, gave the  main  occupation  of
     the Bajuni as fishermen, named its principal export as bananas, and the
     SNF as a political party.  Whether there was at any time in question  a
     government of Somalia for it to take  part  in,  as  the  asylum-seeker
     said, is another matter; though immediate after that answer to Q48  she
     set off into an explanation of how she  had  not  been  to  school,  or
     followed events, and how women were discriminated against.  Despite all
     of those things she is clearly well able to speak up for herself.

  4. When the adjudicator refers to "the lower burden of proof",  he  should
     be taken as meaning the Karanakaran [2000] Imm AR 271 threshold.   That
     means that he was to take due account of the asylum-seeker's  claim  to
     be a Bajuni resident of Kismayu, if on the evidence as  a  whole  there
     was any doubt about it.  What we have to decide is whether  or  not  he
     was clearly wrong in the answer he came to.  If he was right,  then  he
     was obviously also entitled to accept the  asylum-seeker's  claimed  to
     have been raped by Darod soldiers in September 2000 in Kismayu, and  to
     have fled to Kenya as a result' but, if wrong, then the whole  scenario
     for that disappears.  If he was clearly wrong about her  origins,  then
     he cannot have been right to accept her story.  Whether he was  or  not
     is what we have to decide.  We also bear in mind  the  points  we  have
     noted in the asylum-seeker's favour at � 3 above; though it has  to  be
     said that individual points of information of that kind are  likely  to
     be supplied by any briefing worth the name.  A person of any sense,  as
     this asylum-seeker  clearly  is,  despite  any  lack  of  education  or
     seclusion from which she might have  suffered,  might  also  have  been
     expected to realize that a coastal people were likely to be  fishermen,
     and an acronym to represent a political party.  Having said that,  this
     asylum-seeker did get what she had been asked about Somalia and Kismayu
     right rather than wrong.  We should also point out, because  it  is  in
     her favour, thought not canvassed  at  the  hearing,  that  a  possible
     discrepancy between her first interview, where she says at Q4 that  her
     husband was killed by policemen, and her evidence to  the  adjudicator,
     where she blamed soldiers, is no such thing.  As is well know to anyone
     used to hearing cases from this part of the world, both are 'askari' in
     Swahili.

  5. The Home Office's case that the adjudicator was wrong is based on three
     questions:

     a) Why could the asylum-seeker speak only Swahili?

     b) Why did she seem to know nothing about the  cataclysmic  events  of
        1999 in Kismayu? and

     c) Why did she describe it (in her oral evidence  and  before)  as  "a
        village near Mogadishu"?

     c) was not seriously pursued before us by Mr Jones.  While  Kismayu  is
     certainly bigger than a village, to our way of thinking, it may well be
     less than the city the Home Office called it.  From the  names  of  the
     hospital and roads which the asylum-seeker gave,  she  clearly  had  in
     mind a town at least something like the real  one.   While  the  'Times
     Atlas of the World' shows Kismayu about 500 km from Mogadishu, there is
     no reason why the asylum-seeker should be expected ever  to  have  made
     that journey.  It is questions a) and b) on which the Home  Office  say
     the adjudicator should not, in the light of  the  background  evidence,
     have accepted the asylum-seeker's explanations for her ignorance on the
     points in question.

  6. a) Language   The position of the minority tribes in Somalia is covered
     in unusual detail in the report of a joint British,  Danish  and  Dutch
     fact-finding mission which  visited  Nairobi  in  September  2000.   Of
     course there would have been great difficulty  in  their  carrying  out
     their inquiries in Somalia itself' and they were able in Kenya to speak
     to a large number of Somalis and others with knowledge of that country,
     as well as considering previous  research  from  people  who  had  been
     there.  This is what they say about the Kibajuni language, on the basis
     of their talks with a group of elders from the Bajuni islands (see � 56
     of the report):

     5.2 Language

     According to the elders most Bajuni speak  some  Somali,  although  the
     main language spoke by the Bajuni is |Kibajuni, a  dialect  related  to
     Swahili.  The Bajuni elders advised the delegation that younger Bajuni,
     who have lived in exile, alienated from mainstream Somali society,  may
     have only a very limited knowledge of Somali  but  they  stressed  that
     they should know at least some key words  in  Somali  as  their  family
     elders would have taught them.  Barnard Harborne, Chief of the  UN  Co-
     ordination Unit for Somalia, with whom the delegation met, also  stated
     that most Bajuni are able to speak some Somali in addition to Kibajuni.

     The  Bajuni  elders  informed  the  delegation  that,  although   their
     language, Kibajuni, is related  to  Swahili,  their  language  is  very
     different  to  the  Swahili  dialect  spoken  in  the  areas  of  Kenya
     immediately below the Kenya-Somalia border, including the islands  that
     continue from the Somali border down along the coast  towards  Mombasa,
     although there are some common words.

  7. The reference to Kibajuni being related to  Swahili  (sometimes  called
     kiSwahili) is easily appreciated from their common structure: both  are
     Bantu languages, with their characteristic prefixes, ki  for  inanimate
     nouns, and ba for people in the plural or  collectively.   Perhaps  the
     language should strictly be called 'kiJuni'; but we shall use the terms
     in the material before us, rather than risk confusing  anyone.   Somali
     is of course a language from the wholly different Hamitic  family:  see
     the discussion in Mukhtar Shala Mohd. [2001] Imm AR 162.  This  asylum-
     seeker speaks no Somali at all, which the report suggest that she might
     have been expected to do, having lived in Kismayu all her life till she
     was nearly 38; but that is not the language point  on  which  Mr  Jones
     relies.  What he says is that the Swahili which is her only language is
     not consistent with her being a Bajuni at all, on the basis of what the
     Bajuni elders told the joint fact-finding mission [FFM].

  8. Miss Savage on  the  other  hand  points  to  the  asylum-seeker's  own
     evidence about the Bajuni language being "the same  as  Swahili  expect
     for a different pronunciation and or different colloquial term  [sic]".
     To support that, she relies on the CIPU report: the relevant part reads

     5.25  The small Bajuni  population,  numbering  some  3,000  to  4,000,
     possibly as many as 11,000, are mainly sailors and fishermen  who  live
     in small communities on the coast  south  of  Kismayo  and  on  islands
     between Kismayo and the border with Kenya.  The  Bajuni  are  of  mixed
     Arabic, Bantu, Somali and possibly  Malay  ancestry.   Their  principal
     language is Kibajuni, a dialect of Swahili.  Bajuni elders who met with
     the delegation of a joint British-Danish-Dutch fact-finding mission  on
     Somali minority groups  to  Nairobi  in  September  2000  informed  the
     delegation that most Bajuni also speak Somali.  The elders stated  that
     younger Bajuni, who have lived mainly  in  exile,  might  only  have  a
     limited knowledge of Somali but they stressed that they should know  at
     least some key words in Somali as their family elders would have taught
     them.  The elders stated that the Bajuni do not regard themselves as  a
     Benadiri  people,  although  they  had  some  trading  links  with  the
     Bravanese people. [39]

  9. Miss Savage of course relies on what is said about "Kibajuni, a dialect
     of Swahili", and it being the Bajuni's principal language. However,  as
     pointed out to her, the text of the CIPU report very clearly shows that
     it is derived from the FFM one: since we  have  the  original  of  that
     before us, it would be absurd to rely  on  secondary  evidence  of  its
     contents, when we can look at what the elders said themselves about the
     relationship between Kibajuni  and  Swahili,  and  what  languages  the
     Bajuni speak.  The work 'principal' is  of  course  am  ore  portentous
     version of the FFM's 'main'.  We do take account  of  her  next  point,
     about some Bajuni only having  a  very  limited  knowledge  of  Somali:
     whether that would extend to a lady of this asylum-seeker's age who had
     lived in Kismayu all her life not knowing any at all  is,  as  we  have
     said, not something we are called on to decide here.   As  Miss  Savage
     goes on to point out, the asylum-seeker said at the first  question  of
     her first interview that she only spoke Swahili: at Q35 of  the  second
     she said of the language used by Bajuni: "Some of us speak Kibajuni and
     the rest of us speak Swahili".

 10. In reply Mr Jones refers us to what the asylum-seeker herself told  the
     adjudicator at � 23: leaving out the oratio oblique, it reads

     ... the Bajuni's [sic] do not usually speak Kisibuni they mostly  spoke
     Swahili.  It is the same language ... but with different accents and it
     was colloquial. ... the Bajuni tribe do not speak Somali.

       Everyone  agrees  that  "Kisibuni"  is  a  transcription  error   for
     "Kibajuni".  Mr Jones's point is that here was  the  asylum-seeker  not
     making a  difference  between  Swahili-speaking  and  Kibajuni-speaking
     Bajuni, but claiming that all  of  them  spoke  a  language  which  was
     essentially the same as Swahili.

 11. It will be convenient for us to give our views on the language question
     here before we come on to part b) of the Home  Office  case:  see  �  4
     above.  No-one should think, however, that we have not  considered  the
     whole of the evidence in this case before making  up  our  minds.   The
     adjudicator was content to  accept  the  asylum-seeker's  case  on  the
     language point in rather impressionistic terms, which we have set  out.
     We do not mean to criticize him unduly for that: adjudicators are  busy
     enough with taking the oral evidence, and we  certainly  bear  in  mind
     that he heard the asylum-seeker and accepted it in this case.  However,
     his acceptance  of  the  asylum-seeker's  individual  case-history  is,
     rightly, based on his acceptance of her account of her origins:

     I find that she is credible.  I find that she is a citizen  of  Somalia
     and that she comes from Kisimayo and that she is a member of the Bajuni
     Tribe.  I believe her story.

 12. Essentially the adjudicator was faced with two quite different accounts
     of what language the Bajuni speak.  The  asylum-seeker  told  him  they
     speak a language which did not seriously differ from  Swahili:  looking
     at the passage we have quoted at � 9 above, the obvious  comparison  is
     with the difference between English and Scots, speakers of which  might
     well describe their language as English,  especially  to  a  foreigner.
     The elders on the other hand told the FFM that their language was "very
     different" from the language spoken in  neighbouring  areas  of  Kenya,
     though  there  were  "some  common  words".  That  is  another  picture
     altogether: the reference to "some common words" puts into context what
     the elders meant by "very different".  If their account is to be relied
     on, then someone who spoke Kibajuni could not possibly  describe  their
     language as Swahili, nor assert that there was  no  serious  difference
     between them.

 13. We have no doubt that the adjudicator was wrong not to take account  of
     this point, and to write off the difference between the  two  languages
     as merely one of dialect, in the  sense  put  forward  by  the  asylum-
     seeker.  We should make it quite clear that we are not relying  on  any
     supposed  order  of  magnitude  difference  between   'languages'   and
     'dialects': as someone once said (no doubt before  the  advent  of  air
     forces), a language is merely a dialect with its  own  army  and  navy.
     The real point is that,  according  to  the  elders,  the  neighbouring
     version of Swahili and Kibajuni are only mutually understandable  to  a
     limited extent.  There is nothing in the background evidence to support
     any suggestion that there are separate populations of  Swahili-speaking
     and Kibajuni-speaking Bajuni; nor was that the case put forward by  the
     asylum-seeker herself in her oral evidence before the adjudicator.

 14. Miss Savage rightly points out that the elders came from  the  islands,
     and this  asylum-seeker,  she  says,  from  Kismayu  on  the  mainland.
     However, there is an obvious difficulty for her  in  writing  off  what
     they had to say in that way: if the asylum-seeker's  language  is  like
     enough to the local version of Swahili for her to describe it as  such,
     then it cannot have enough in common with  Kibajuni  as  known  to  the
     elders for her claim to speak  that  language  at  all.   There  is  no
     evidence of any intermediate form; and on what the elders say about the
     difference between the languages, none could  reasonably  be  expected.
     The FFM also make clear (at � 5.1) that the elders described the Bajuni
     as "a united people that are not divided into sub-groups".  While there
     may well be young Bajuni who have grown up in refugee  camps  in  Kenya
     speaking Swahili, that is not this asylum-seeker's history.   We  shall
     decide what view should be taken of her case when we  have  dealt  with
     all the  evidence;  but  we  think  adjudicators  should  approach  any
     involving someone who claims to be a Bajuni resident  of  Somalia,  but
     who cannot speak Kibajuni (let alone Somali), with great caution.

 15. b) events of 1998-99   This is what the CIPU report  says,  so  far  as
     relevant:

     3.43 Heavy fighting took place around Kismayo in early November 1998 as
     the Marehan SNF advance on the  city,  held  by  General  Morgan's  SPM
     forces. 65 people were reportedly killed.  Peace  talks  were  held  in
     Nairobi in November 1998 but many people fled Kismayo and further heavy
     fighting took place in December 1998, with Morgan retaining control  of
     the  city.   It  was  reported  in  January  1999  that  the   Puntland
     administration  had  sent  arms  to  Morgan's   militia   in   Kismayo.
     [19a][19b][19c][25][26b]

     3.44 After several months of calm there were renewed clashes in Kismayo
     in May 1999 between SNF and Morgan's SPM forces.  The  SNF  and  allied
     Habr Gedir clan forces, grouped together as the  Allied  Somali  Forces
     (ASF), attacked Kismayo in June 1999 and finally ousted General  Morgan
     and his forces.  26 people reportedly died in  fighting  but  calm  was
     restored quickly after the ASF had assumed control.  ASF fighters  were
     removed from Kismayo and taken to designated areas  outside  the  town.
     Colonel Ali Hashi Buraleh, one of the  leaders  of  the  ASF  grouping,
     stated that the alliance was free of  tribalism  or  factionalism.   He
     appealed for outside aid for Kismayo,  stating  that  the  security  of
     international     aid      workers      would      be      safeguarded.
     [7p][22h][22i][26e][28]

     The FFM (� 5.4) more graphically quote the chief security  officer  for
     UNDP-Somalia as describing the situation in Kismayu since  its  capture
     by the SNA/SNF as "hell".

 16. Miss Savage relies  on  what  the  asylum-seeker  said  at  her  second
     interview, in answer to Qs 30-31:

     I never lived in peace, since soldiers would  attack  our  village  and
     kill some people.  There was a state of [illegible].   They raped girls
     and women in the village.  [asked when the war in Somalia  had  stated]
     Many years ago around the 1990s I can't remember exactly when.

     There is also what she said in her statement filed with the Home Office
     by her solicitors:

     My father was a fisherman by  occupation.   Our  country  was  peaceful
     before the  war  but  ever  since  the  war  our  country  has  changed
     dramatically.  Women were raped, men were killed, our houses burnt  and
     most of the Bajun property was looted.

     We suffered the most because we belong to the minority clan.   Most  of
     our people are self-employed because they did not have  the  chance  to
     obtain any education and therefore have no employment opportunities  in
     the government.  We are the most vulnerable group in Somalia.  The  war
     was instigated by, the major clans of Somali, the  Darood,  Hawiye  and
     Issac and including other major groups of Somalia.

     [The statement then goes straight on to the events of September 2000].

 17. The adjudicator's conclusions on this point, which he clearly  set  out
     at � 24, appear from his � 37, quoted in full at our � 2.  Again he  is
     content to take a somewhat impressionistic view  of  what  the  asylum-
     seeker would be likely to know about events  outside  her  home.   Some
     people  (not  us)  might  also  criticize  it   as   tending   to   the
     stereotypical.  However, the accounts given by the asylum-seeker are  a
     reasonably accurate account of general events in Somalia, and may  also
     be regarded as a reasonable summary of the position of the  Bajuni:  Mr
     Jones's point is that they completely  fail  to  mention  the  specific
     events of 1998-99  in  Kismayu.   It  was  not  inappropriate  for  the
     presenting officer  before  the  adjudicator  to  take  this  point  in
     closing, rather than in cross-examination,  because  the  question  was
     what the asylum-seeker had been able to tell the Home Office about  the
     events, rather than what she knew by the time of the hearing.

 18. Bearing in mind the asylum-seeker's own account of being an  uneducated
     and presumably secluded  woman,  in  our  view  even  someone  in  that
     category, who had lived through  the  dramatic  events  of  1998-99  in
     Kismayu, would have taken in more of them than she  has  given  in  her
     accounts.  She for her part was well able to speak for herself,  as  we
     have noted from her interview,  whatever  her  educational  and  social
     background.  These were  not  events  being  played  out  on  a  remote
     political stage; but the ebb and flow of war in what she said  was  her
     own town.  We have no doubt that the adjudicator was wrong not to  take
     the view that a person who had  lived  through  them  might  have  been
     expected to have something to say about them,  significantly  over  the
     general account given by the asylum-seeker.

 19. Conclusions  For each of the main reason - a) and b) - put  forward  by
     Mr Jones for the Home Officer we have come to the conclusion  that  the
     adjudicator was clearly wrong to accept this asylum-seeker's account as
     he did.  We should not want him or anyone else to take  that  criticism
     unduly to heart.  His decision was a very conscientious piece  of  work
     indeed, and he clearly set out the Home Office case.  So far as we have
     any general message for him or adjudicators at large, it  concerns  the
     importance of closely assessing the individual asylum-seeker's  account
     with reference to the available background evidence.  The more specific
     this is, as here, the more important the result to the  decision-making
     process.
