                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the appellants against a decision of  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  dismissing  their  appeals  against  the   respondent's
    decision of 9 February 2016 refusing to grant them EEA  family  permits
    as dependent family members of their sponsor, their son-in-law, an  EEA
    national exercising treaty rights in the UK.

Background.

2.    The appellants are citizens of Albania born on 2 June 1962 and 1  July
    1962 respectively.  On 26 January 2016 they applied for a family permit
    on the basis that they were dependent on their son  in  law,  a  Polish
    citizen, working in the  UK  and  married  to  their  daughter.   Their
    application forms  are  identically  worded,  save  when  referring  to
    matters of personal identity such as name and date of  birth.  At  [65]
    and [66] of their application they  say  that  they  have  no  savings,
    property or other income and at [67] in answer to the question  of  how
    much they spend each month on living expenses, they reply �75.  At [78]
    they say that they are unemployed  and  financially  dependent  on  the
    sponsor and  their  daughter.   At  [145]  they  refer  to  a  previous
    application which  had  been  refused  on  the  basis  that  the  entry
    clearance officer  believed  they  were  receiving  state  benefits  in
    Albania.  They say they are not sure where the  officer  obtained  this
    information  but,  in  any  event,  they   have   provided   additional
    information to confirm that they are not receiving any  such  benefits.
    They repeat that they are not receiving any state benefits, pension  or
    social assistance and that they rely solely on their  sponsor  to  meet
    their essential living needs.

3.    However, their application was refused on  the  basis  that  they  had
    provided no evidence to demonstrate the cost of their essential  living
    expenses such as food, utilities, clothing and  accommodation  and  the
    respondent was not satisfied they were wholly financially dependent  on
    an EEA national in the UK.  The decision was upheld on entry  clearance
    review.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

4.    The appeal was determined without a hearing but the judge had  written
    submissions on behalf of the appellants and a large bundle of documents
    paginated 1-271.  The judge was satisfied that the documentary evidence
    confirmed the relationship  between  the  sponsor,  his  wife  and  the
    appellants and that numerous money transfers dating from 9 January 2011
    until 23 September 2016 had been made virtually on a monthly basis, and
    sometimes with more than one transfer a month, in sums ranging  between
    �90 and �900 but the majority of the transfers appeared to  be  between
    �190 and �300. The judge identified as the only issue in the appeal  as
    that of dependency.  He referred to Jia v Migrations  Verket  (C-1/05),
    judgment of 9  January  2007,  CJEC,  as  authority  that  it  was  not
    necessary for the appellants to show that they were wholly dependent on
    the sponsor, but the correct approach  was  whether  having  regard  to
    their social and financial conditions, they were not in a  position  to
    support themselves.

5.    The  judge  said  that  even  applying  the  test  of  mere  financial
    dependency there was no evidence  other  than  the  statements  by  the
    appellants in their application forms that they were unemployed.   They
    had provided no evidence in relation to the status of  their  residence
    or their state of unemployment in Albania.  He  appreciated  that  this
    requirement was not readily obvious from the application form, but  the
    appellants had had the opportunity of providing  this  information  and
    had failed to do so.  On the totality of the evidence  and  bearing  in
    mind that the burden of proof lay on the appellants, he found that  the
    respondent's decision was in accordance with the Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the 2006  Regulations)  and  that  the
    appellants could not meet the requirements  of  article  8  within  the
    Immigration Rules or exceptionally outside those Rules.

The Grounds of Appeal.

6.    In the grounds of appeal, it is argued that the judge failed to  apply
    the correct test on dependency.  He had referred to [37] of Jia whereas
    he should have referred to [43].  It is further argued that  the  judge
    failed to address the issue of dependency in the context of EU law  and
    that he was wrong to find that there was no  evidence  other  than  the
    appellants 'statements  in  their  application  forms  that  they  were
    unemployed.  There was evidence in the documents particularly at  [60]-
    [77] to support their assertions that they were unemployed and  not  in
    receipt of any state benefit.

7.    When granting permission to appeal UTJ Blum said that  the  provisions
    of [37] in Jia were not materially different from the test  articulated
    at [45], namely that the person claiming to be dependent  had  to  show
    that they needed the material support of the community national or  his
    or her spouse to meet their essential needs.  However, it was  arguable
    that the judge had failed to consider material evidence  at  pages  61,
    64, 67 and 70-78 in the bundle supporting their claim  that  they  were
    not employed and received no other  income.   Had  that  evidence  been
    considered, it might have altered the judge's conclusion.

8.    Mr Bahja adopted his grounds and submitted that the documents  in  the
    bundle before the First-tier  Tribunal  provided  confirmation  of  the
    claims the appellants had made.  The judge had overlooked this evidence
    and in consequence had failed to take relevant evidence  into  account.
    Mr Nath submitted that the judge  had  not  erred  in  law.   The  fact
    remained that there were no adequate details of the appellants'  living
    expenses.  The burden was on them to prove their case and the judge had
    explained why they had failed to do so.   The  issue  of  their  living
    expenses had been raised in the respondent's decision but had not  been
    further addressed in the evidence submitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

The Error of Law.

9.    I must consider whether the judge erred in law such that the  decision
    should be set aside.  In [13] he said that there was no  evidence  from
    the appellants apart from their statements in the application form that
    they were unemployed and they had provided no  evidence  regarding  the
    status of their residence and their state of unemployment  in  Albania.
    In fact, there was documentary evidence capable of confirming that  the
    first appellant was not receiving social assistance in Albania at  [70]
    and was not in receipt of a pension  at  [67]  and  similarly  for  the
    second appellant at  [61]  and  [64].   There  was  evidence  that  the
    appellants were registered with the Regional  Directorate  of  National
    Employment Service, Tirana, as unemployed jobseekers at  [77]  for  the
    first  appellant  and  [74]  for  the  second  appellant.  There   was,
    therefore, evidence other than in their written statements  to  confirm
    that they were unemployed and not in receipt of state benefits.   Their
    lack of pension  and  social  assistance  and  their  unemployment  was
    clearly of direct relevance to  whether  they  were  dependent  on  the
    sponsor and it follows that when considering this issue, the judge left
    relevant evidence out of account capable of confirming their statements
    and thereby erred in law.  I am satisfied that the error is  such  that
    the decision should be set aside.

Re-making the Decision.

10.   Both representatives agreed that if the decision was  set  aside,  the
    proper course would be for me to re-make the decision.  Neither  sought
    to make any further submissions in addition to those already made.

11.    There  is  no  dispute  that  the  appellants  have  been   receiving
    consistent financial support from the sponsor and their daughter in the
    UK.  The issue is whether they can show that they are dependants within
    the provisions of reg. 7 of the 2006 Regulations.  In their application
    forms both appellants said that they were unemployed, not in receipt of
    a pension or state benefits and  had  no  savings,  property  or  other
    income.  There had been a previous  adverse  decision  when  the  entry
    clearance officer had raised the issue of whether they were in  receipt
    of state benefit in Albania.  That issue was addressed at [145] of  the
    application form.  The appellants have  produced  documentary  evidence
    referred to above from the relevant authorities in Albania,  translated
    into English  by  a  public  notary,  that  they  receive  no  economic
    assistance, are not receiving a pension and are unemployed.   There  is
    no adequate basis in the evidence before me to raise any concern  about
    whether the documents are genuine and on the balance of probabilities I
    accept that they are genuine and reliable documents.

12.   The only evidence as to the appellants' living costs is at [67]  where
    they say they spend �75 a month.  It would have been  helpful  to  have
    more precise details about their living expenses,  but  I  accept  that
    they are unemployed, not in receipt of any pension or state benefit  in
    Albania and they have no other source of income  apart  from  the  sums
    received from the sponsor.  The judge accepted  that  regular  payments
    have been sent from January 2011 onwards in varying sums, the  majority
    being between �190-�300.  The most likely explanation for such  regular
    transfers is to provide support for the appellants.  In  the  light  of
    the finding that they are unemployed and otherwise without income, I am
    satisfied that they have been looking to the sponsor and their daughter
    for support to meet their essential needs.  I find that the  appellants
    have been receiving and continue to receive financial support from  the
    sponsor and have shown that they are dependent on him and are  entitled
    to family permits.

Decision.

13.   The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and the decision  is  set  aside.
    I re-make the decision and allow the  appeal  against  the  refusal  of
    family permits.
