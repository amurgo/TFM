                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago born on 28th December
    1979. She first came to the UK on 18th June 2000 with  entry  clearance
    as a working holiday maker. She then remained as a student and with  an
    EEA residence card as the spouse of a Swedish citizen. She was lawfully
    present until her divorce from her Swedish  husband  on  5th  September
    2007. She appealed the revocation of her residence permit but this  was
    unsuccessful and she became appeal rights exhausted on 3rd March  2009.
    After this time she made an application for another EEA residence  card
    and one outside of the Immigration Rules which was  refused  without  a
    right of appeal. She made representations that her removal would  be  a
    breach of the European Convention on Human Rights on 4th July 2012  and
    22nd December 2014. This application was refused on 12th January  2015.
    She appealed on 20th January 2015.   Her  appeal  was  dismissed  by  a
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Beg promulgated  on  19th  August
    2015 ("the Decision").

 2. On 29th December 2015 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pooler  found
    that the Decision contained an arguable error of  law  because  it  was
    arguable that Judge Beg had applied  the  wrong  version  of  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules ("the Rules"). Judge  Pooler  expressly
    confined the grant of permission to this  ground,  and  not  the  three
    other grounds put forward by the Appellant.

 3. The matter comes before me to determine whether the Decision contains a
    material error of law.

Submissions

 4. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Sharma sought to renew his application
    for permission to argue grounds  two  to  four  in  relation  to  which
    permission  to  appeal  was  refused.   He  accepted  that  no   formal
    application had been made to renew.  Having heard brief submissions  on
    the substance of those grounds, I determined that I  would  not  permit
    him to renew the application for permission to appeal.  In any event, I
    agree with First-tier Tribunal Judge Pooler that those grounds are  not
    arguable.

 5. It was common ground that the Judge applied the wrong test in  relation
    to the Appellant's private life.  She  applied  the  test  whether  the
    Appellant has no ties, including social, cultural or family  ties  with
    Trinidad  and  Tobago  [12].   It  is  possible  that  this  error  was
    compounded by the submissions of the Appellant's Counsel that this  was
    the appropriate test.  However, the Rules changed on 28 July  2014  and
    the current version of the paragraph insofar as relevant to  this  case
    is now in the following terms:-

         "276ADE (1)   The requirements to be met by an applicant for  leave
         to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at  the
         date of application, the applicant:

         ...

         (vi) is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously  in  the  UK
         for less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but
         there would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the  applicant's
         integration into the country to  which  he  would  have  to  go  if
         required to leave the UK"

 6. Since the issue of whether the Judge erred in law is accepted  by  both
    sides, the issue  becomes  one  of  materiality.   Mr  Sharma  for  the
    Appellant submitted that it was not possible to pre-judge  the  outcome
    if the right test were to be applied.  Mr Avery submitted that  it  was
    inconceivable that another Judge could  reach  a  different  conclusion
    applying the "very significant obstacles" test since, if anything, that
    is a more stringent test to satisfy.

 7.  Mr  Sharma  submitted  that  what  distinguishes  this  case  is   the
    Appellant's circumstances in Trinidad and Tobago before she came to the
    UK and the stage in her life at which she came here.  He pointed to the
    fact that the Appellant has no family in Trinidad and  Tobago  and  was
    brought up in an orphanage.  She  completed  her  education  there  but
    never worked there.  She had been sponsored by Father Girod of the Holy
    Ghost Fathers who was the chaplain at the children's home and a  letter
    was produced from him in her support but, Mr Sharma submitted, that did
    not come close to showing that Father Girod would be able to  give  the
    Appellant the kind of  support  which  she  would  need  on  return  to
    Trinidad and Tobago.  Although this trespassed in part on ground two in
    relation to which permission to appeal was refused, Mr Sharma submitted
    that it would not  be  reasonable  for  the  Appellant's  partner,  now
    husband, to return to  Trinidad  and  Tobago  with  her.   It  was  not
    reasonable to expect her to return to get entry clearance and he  could
    not support her from the UK in the way which would be  needed  for  the
    Appellant to reintegrate.  In fact, said Mr Sharma, this is not a  case
    of reintegration at all but a case of initial integration in  light  of
    the Appellant's age when she left Trinidad and Tobago, lack  of  family
    there and lack of any employment history.  The Appellant  has  adjusted
    to life according to the ways of  Western  Europe  and  adopted  skills
    relevant to that life which would not avail her on return.  Those were,
    Mr Sharma submitted, the very significant obstacles in this case.

 8. Mr  Avery  submitted  that  the  adoption  of  the  old  test  made  no
    difference.  Based on the facts at [13] and [14] of  the  Decision  and
    the Judge's findings at [29] in relation  to  the  Appellant's  private
    life, it was inconceivable that a Judge could form any different  view.
    The findings were adequately reasoned.  They were not supportive of  an
    assertion that the  Appellant  would  have  no  support  on  return  to
    Trinidad and Tobago.

Discussion and conclusions

 9. I am satisfied that there is an error of law in the Decision.  That  is
    accepted by both parties. The issue as I identify above is whether  the
    error is material.  The Judge applied the wrong  version  of  paragraph
    276ADE (1)(vi) of the Rules when considering this appeal. The focus  of
    this appeal is therefore the  Appellant's  private  life  and  not  the
    Appellant's family life.  As Mr Sharma noted,  the  Appellant  has  now
    married her partner and as such  her  family  life  would  fall  to  be
    considered under Appendix FM to the Rules.  However, unless there is  a
    material error of law in the Decision, she will have to raise this with
    the Respondent by way of a further application.

10. Turning then to the Appellant's private life, the  Judge  set  out  her
    evidence about this at [12] to [14] of the Decision:-

         "[12]    The appellant claimed that she has been in a  relationship
         with Mr Stephen since 2012 but that they  only  started  cohabiting
         together in 2015.  Mr Sharma on the  appellant's  behalf  submitted
         that in respect of private life under  paragraph  276ADE,  although
         the appellant has not been in this  country  for  twenty  years  as
         required under the Rules nonetheless  she  has  no  ties  including
         social, cultural or family  ties  with  Trinidad  and  Tobago.   In
         Bossadi (ss117A-D - interrelationship with Rules) [2015] UKUT 00415
         (IAC)  the  Court  considered  the  issue  of   paragraph   276ADE,
         suitability and ties.  The court confirmed that  what  is  required
         when a person needs to show that he or she  is  aged  18  years  or
         above and has lived continuously in the  United  Kingdom  for  less
         than twenty years but has no ties with the country to which  he  or
         she would have to go if required to leave the UK is:

             "... a rounded assessment as to whether  a  person's  familial
             ties could result in support to him or her in the event of his
             or  her  return,  an  assessment  taking  into  account   both
             subjective and objective considerations and also consideration
             of what lies within the choice of a claimant to achieve."

         [13] The appellant gave evidence that she grew up in  Trinidad  and
         Tobago at the Saint Dominic's Orphanage  where  she  remained  just
         before her 18th birthday.  She was then in foster care for a  short
         period while she did her A-levels; following that she came  to  the
         United Kingdom as a working holidaymaker.  Mr Sharma  submitted  on
         the  appellant's  behalf  that  she  has  no  family,  property  or
         connections  in  Trinidad  and  Tobago  and  therefore  no  support
         network.  I do not find that credible.  Whilst I  accept  that  the
         appellant was living at Saint Dominic's Children's Home in Trinidad
         and Tobago,  she  clearly  had  considerable  support  from  Father
         Gervase Girod.  A letter  from  Father  Girod  of  the  Holy  Ghost
         Fathers, dated 24 March 2011 states that he was the Roman  Catholic
         chaplain at Saint Dominic's  Children's  Home  and  that  he  began
         working at the home from 1979.  He was appointed  chaplain  by  the
         then Archbishop of Port of Spain.

         [14] Father Girod states in his letter that the  appellant  was  at
         the children's home from the age of 4 until the age of 17.  He also
         states that she has no family members who have been in contact with
         her while she was at  the  children's  home.   The  appellant  gave
         evidence that Father Girod not only assisted her in paying for  her
         A-level course fees but also sponsored her to come  to  the  United
         Kingdom.  He continues to provide moral support to  the  appellant.
         His letter is confirmation of that.   I  find  that  the  appellant
         therefore has some level of social and cultural ties with  Trinidad
         and Tobago and came to the United Kingdom  as  an  adult.   She  is
         familiar with the country and its culture.  She also  retains  some
         contacts with  friends.   Consequently  I  do  not  find  that  the
         appellant meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules."

11. Having directed herself according to the relevant case law,  the  Judge
    then went on to  consider  the  Appellant's  private  and  family  life
    applying that case law.  In  so  doing,  she  also  made  reference  to
    section 117 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  In  relation
    to the Appellant's private life, she accepted that the Appellant was in
    the UK lawfully for some time although became an overstayer  in  recent
    years.  Her previous residence though was precarious.  By the time that
    she formed a relationship with her  now  husband  she  was  in  the  UK
    unlawfully.  The Judge noted that the Appellant's husband could support
    an application by her for entry clearance  from  Trinidad  and  Tobago.
    The Judge went on to deal with the Appellant's private life at [29]  of
    the Decision in the following way:-

         "[29]    Mr Sharma submitted on the appellant's behalf that he  did
         not rely upon Article 3 ECHR in respect  of  a  written  submission
         that the appellant would be destitute in Trinidad and  Tobago.   He
         submitted however that the appellant would have no  employment  and
         no home to go to in Trinidad and Tobago where she  has  no  support
         network.  In MA (prove destitution) Jamaica [2005] UKIAT 00013  the
         court held that anyone making a claim that he will be destitute  if
         returned to his country of origin must be able to establish that by
         making proper enquiries.  I find that the appellant  has  not  been
         able to  demonstrate  to  the  civil  standard  that  she  will  be
         destitute in Trinidad and Tobago.  For  the  reasons  that  I  have
         already given, I find that she has some support network in Trinidad
         and Tobago where she spent her formative years.  She is clearly  in
         contact with Father Girod.  I find that the appellant could utilise
         her work experience to seek employment in her home country.  She is
         a well educated and well travelled woman.   I  find  that  she  has
         friends including her current partner Mr Stephen who would be  able
         to financially support her to help her  resettle  in  Trinidad  and
         Tobago.  I find that Mr Stephen could either make a decision to  go
         and live with the appellant  in  Trinidad  and  Tobago  to  conduct
         family  life  or  support  an  entry  clearance  application.    In
         conclusion I find that any interference in the appellant's  Article
         8 rights will be both legitimate and proportionate.  Maintenance of
         effective immigration control is in the public interest."

12. In terms of the obstacles to reintegration in Trinidad and Tobago,  the
    high point of the Appellant's  evidence  is  at  [11]  of  her  witness
    statement:-

         "I consider the UK to be my home and primary  place  of  residence.
         It is where I have established true ties for the first time  in  my
         life.  Returning to Trinidad and Tobago is not  a  feasible  option
         for me.  I do not have any family or friends there because  I  left
         when I was 20 after my A-levels.  I have never been employed  there
         and do not know  how  the  economic  and  financial  market  works.
         Further, there will be no support system for me should I  relocate.
         It is impractical to ask my fianc� to help me as he would then have
         to support two households on his income.  I cannot rely on  support
         from my friends here in the UK either as  I  would  be  relying  on
         their largesse.  I cannot rely on them to support  me  indefinitely
         because I do not know when I will be able to secure employment.  My
         partner cannot relocate with me as we have both never lived  there;
         therefore our employment prospects are slim.  We both have  friends
         and family here in the United Kingdom and this  is  where  we  have
         established roots.  Our decision to remain in the UK is not because
         it is merely convenient to do so, but because  forcefully  removing
         me will result in an unduly harsh decision  in  my  matter  and  my
         circumstances gives rise to consideration of compassion".

13. Mr Sharma took issue with the findings of the Judge in relation to  the
    support which the Appellant could expect  on  return  to  Trinidad  and
    Tobago.  He said that Father Girod's short letter  gave  no  indication
    that he  would  be  able  to  support  the  Appellant.   However,  that
    exaggerates the nature of the Judge's finding in that regard. All  that
    she found is that Father Girod  remains  in  Trinidad  and  Tobago  and
    continues to support the Appellant by, for example, writing the  letter
    in support of her application.  The Judge refers to  the  "considerable
    support" which Father Girod gave the  Appellant  in  the  past  as  the
    Appellant herself records.  It  is  not  though  part  of  the  Judge's
    findings that Father Girod would be other than the Appellant's "support
    network" on return.  As the Judge points out,  the  Appellant  did  not
    leave Trinidad and Tobago until she was an adult.  She grew  up  there.
    She would therefore be familiar  with  the  country  and  its  culture.
    Although she did not work in Trinidad and Tobago it is of course  worth
    noting that when the Appellant came to the UK aged  twenty  years,  she
    had no familiarity with the job market here or indeed any  family  here
    or familiarity with UK society or culture.  The  Judge's  finding  that
    she is now well educated and  well  travelled  and  can  use  her  work
    experience to find employment in Trinidad and Tobago was  clearly  open
    to her.

14. Mr Sharma submitted that it was not open to the Judge to  find  against
    the Appellant in light of the Appellant's own expressed  opinion  which
    was not challenged that requiring  her  to  relocate  to  Trinidad  and
    Tobago would be "unduly harsh".  That is though not a  matter  of  fact
    but one of assessment. No doubt the Appellant genuinely envisages  that
    there will be  very  significant  obstacles  to  her  reintegration  in
    Trinidad and Tobago.  However, based on the evidence and her  Counsel's
    submissions,  I  am  quite  unable  to  accept  that  her  case   could
    conceivably meet that high  threshold.   In  the  circumstances,  I  am
    satisfied that the error of law which I  have  found  the  Decision  to
    contain is not a material one.  I accept  the  Respondent's  submission
    that, if anything, the test set by the later incarnation  of  paragraph
    276ADE (1)(vi) is more stringent than  the  earlier  version.   If  the
    correct version of the paragraph had  been  applied,  the  Judge  would
    inevitably have reached the same conclusion that  the  Appellant  could
    not meet the requirements of the Rules. The Appellant does not point to
    any material facts which were overlooked by the Judge in the  Decision.
    Accordingly, the outcome would have been the same whether a test of "no
    ties" or "very significant obstacles" are applied.

Decision

The Decision does not contain a material error of law.  I  therefore  uphold
the Decision.
