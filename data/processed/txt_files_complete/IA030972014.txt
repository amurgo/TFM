For the Respondent:    Mr J Braier instructed by Mitchell Simmonds
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against  a  determination
       of First-tier Tribunal Judge Somal, promulgated on the 2nd  September
       2014, in which the Judge allowed  Mr  Odeyemi's  appeal  against  the
       refusal of his application for leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
       and direction for his removal to Nigeria made pursuant to section  10
       Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.


    2. The Judge records in paragraph 5 of the determination that  the  case
       was  advanced  solely  on  the  basis  of  Article  8  ECHR  as   the
       requirements of the Immigration Rules could not be met. In  paragraph
       18 the Judge recognises the fact that the interests of a  private  or
       family life would not  prevail  over  the  interests  of  immigration
       control and that Article 8 does not entail a general obligation for a
       State to respect an immigrants choice of the county of  residence  in
       its territory.


    3. The Judge refers to the fact Mr Odeyemi entered the United Kingdom as
       a child aged twelve on a temporary basis and did not realise  he  had
       no status until he applied for a national insurance number at the age
       of seventeen in 2010. His evidence was that as soon as he  was  aware
       of his lack of status he made  the  application  which  lead  to  the
       refusal under appeal.


    4. The Judge sets out the key findings in paragraphs 19 and  20  of  the
       determination as follows:


       19.    In determining the issue of proportionality in such cases,  it
          will  always  be  important  to  evaluate  the   extent   of   the
          individual's  social  ties  and  relationships  in  the  UK.   The
          Appellant entered the UK on a temporary basis with no  expectation
          he could stay indefinitely.  He was a child of 12 at the time  and
          decisions were made for him by his father who left him in the care
          of an aunt in the UK and it was always his intention his son would
          never return to Nigeria. The Appellant was not privy to  the  plan
          and was duped by his father.  As soon as  the  Appellant  and  his
          sister learnt what had  happened  at  a  time  when  he  needed  a
          national insurance number he made application  to  regularise  his
          status.  He has lived in the UK 10 years since a child,  has  been
          educated here without reliance upon public  funds,  been  a  model
          student at university and achieved exceptional  results,  has  not
          been in trouble with the police and has  a  close  emotional  bond
          with his sister and nephew with whom  he  had  lived  for  several
          years. He has lived with his sister in the UK as siblings  without
          parents and as a result their emotional bond  goes  beyond  normal
          ties between adults. The Appellant expresses  contrition  for  his
          immigration history but was adamant he knew nothing about it as he
          was a child but has sought to rectify it since he  discovered  the
          problem.


       20.    This Appellants circumstances  are  unfortunate  and  entirely
          down to his father who he trusted  as  a  child  duping  him  into
          thinking he was coming for a  holiday  only.   The  Appellant  has
          acted in good faith and been badly let down by  his  father.   His
          sister corroborates the account he has given.  The Appellant is  a
          genuine and exceptional  student  who  has  nearly  completed  his
          bachelor's course and it would be unfair for him to  be  penalised
          due to the conduct of his father  who  has  badly  let  him  down.
          Whilst it is clear he has family in Nigeria, aside from  providing
          financial support the relationship with his mother  has  not  been
          good and the relationship with his  father  non-existent  now.   I
          find the combination of the tender age at which he entered the UK,
          the 10 years he has lived here, his exceptional  academic  record,
          his strong emotional ties with his sister and nephew and the  fact
          he tried to regularise his status  when  he  found  out  what  his
          father had done all leads me to conclude he should be  allowed  to
          remain and the decision of the Respondent to be  disproportionate.
          I have had regard to section 117 of the 2002 Act in assessing  the
          public interest in my proportionality exercise.


    5. The Secretary of  State  challenges  this  finding  on  a  number  of
       grounds. Permission to appeal was granted on the 9th October 2014.



Error of law finding



    6. When a judge undertakes a proportionality exercise it is necessary to
       ensure the positions of both  parties  are  taken  into  account  and
       analysed as otherwise there cannot be  a  proper  assessment  of  the
       competing interests. Mr Braier was asked at the outset to  refer  the
       Tribunal to the analysis of the Secretary  of  States  case  and  the
       facts relied upon by her in opposing the appeal in the determination,
       which he accepted he could not. The reason for this is that  they  do
       not appear in sufficient detail, if at all, in that document.


    7. I note Mr Braier's submission that the Judge was  aware  of  the  key
       issue as noted in paragraph 5 of the determination and that the Judge
       referred to basic principles of Article 8 in paragraph 18.  I  accept
       the Judge also referred to section 117 of the 2002 Act  in  paragraph
       20 but  appears  to  have  done  no  more  than  this.  Mr  McVeety's
       suggestion that the decision is based upon  the  sympathy  the  Judge
       felt for Mr Odeyemi may have arguable merit,  but  mere  sympathy  is
       insufficient as a good decision is one that is in accordance with the
       law and nothing less, even if at times  appearing  to  be  unfair  to
       some.


    8. The first head of challenge  is  to  the  failure  of  the  Judge  to
       properly consider section 117  of  the  2002  Act.  This  ground  has
       arguable merit as it is not sufficient just to say  that  regard  has
       been had for these provisions without more. The issue in this case is
       whether, when the provisions are properly analysed and the  balancing
       exercise conducted, the result is the same. If so the  error  is  not
       material.


    9. Sections 117A-D provide:


       117A Application of this Part


          (1) This Part applies where a court or  tribunal  is  required  to
          determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
             (a)  breaches a person's right  to  respect  for  private  and
             family life under Article 8, and
             (b)  as a result would be unlawful  under  section  6  of  the
             Human Rights Act 1998.


          (2) In considering the public  interest  question,  the  court  or
          tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
             (a)  in all cases, to the  considerations  listed  in  section
             117B, and
             (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
             to the considerations listed in section 117C.


          (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest  question"  means  the
          question of whether an  interference  with  a  person's  right  to
          respect for private and family life  is  justified  under  Article
          8(2).


       117B Article 8: public  interest  considerations  applicable  in  all
       cases


          (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
          public interest.


          (2)     It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
          interests of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that
          persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
          to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.


          (3)     It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
          interests of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that
          persons who seek to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
          financially  independent, because such persons-
             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.


          (4)     Little weight should be given to-
             (a)  a private life, or
             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that  is
             established by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the
             United Kingdom unlawfully.


          (5)      Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a   private   life
          established by a person at a time when  the  person's  immigration
          status is precarious.


          (6)     In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
          the public interest does not require the person's removal where-
             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and
             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom.


       117C Article 8 additional considerations in cases  involving  foreign
       criminals.


          (1)     The deportation of foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
          interest.


          (2)     The more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
          criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of the
          criminal.


          (3)     In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has  not  been
          sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or  more,  the
          public interest requires C's deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
          Exception 2 applies.


          (4)     Exception 1 applies where-
             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,
             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and
             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.


          (5) Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
          relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a   genuine   and
          subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the
          effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be  unduly
          harsh.


          (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
          period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
          requires   deportation   unless   there   are   very    compelling
          circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1  and
          2.


          (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be  taken
          into account where a court or tribunal is considering  a  decision
          to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent  that  the  reason
          for the decision  was  the  offence  or  offences  for  which  the
          criminal has been convicted.


       117D Interpretation of this Part


          (1)     In this Part-


             "Article 8" means Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on
             Human Rights;


             "qualifying child" means a person who is under the age  of  18
             and who-
                 (a)   is a British citizen, or
                 (b)   has lived in the  United  Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                 period of seven years or more;


             "qualifying partner" means a partner who-
                 (a)   is a British citizen, or
                 (b)   who is settled in  the  United  Kingdom  (within  the
                 meaning of the Immigration Act 1971 - see section 33(2A) of
                 that Act).


          (2)     In this Part, "foreign criminal" means a person-
             (a)  who is not a British citizen,
             (b)  who has been  convicted  in  the  United  Kingdom  of  an
             offence, and
             (c)  who -
                 (i)   has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  at
                 least 12 months,
                 (ii)  has been convicted of  an  offence  that  has  caused
                 serious harm, or
                 (iii)     is a persistent offender.


          (3)     For the purposes of subsection (2)(b), a person subject to
          an order under-
             (a)  section 5 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity)  Act  1964
             (insanity etc),
             (b)  section 57 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act  1995
             (insanity etc), or
             (c)  Article 50A of the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order
             1986 (insanity etc), has not been convicted of an offence.


          (4)     In  this  Part,  references  to  a  person  who  has  been
          sentenced to a period of imprisonment of a certain length of time-


             (a)  do not include a person  who  has  received  a  suspended
             sentence (unless a court subsequently orders that the sentence
             or any part of it (of whatever length) is to take effect);
             (b)  do not include a person  who  has  been  sentenced  to  a
             period of imprisonment of that length of time only  by  virtue
             of being  sentenced  to  consecutive  sentences  amounting  in
             aggregate to that length of time;
             (c)  include a  person  who  is  sentenced  to  detention,  or
             ordered or directed to be detained, in  an  institution  other
             than a prison (including, in  particular,  a  hospital  or  an
             institution for young offenders) for that length of time; and
             (d)  include a person who  is  sentenced  to  imprisonment  or
             detention, or ordered or  directed  to  be  detained,  for  an
             indeterminate period, provided that it may last for  at  least
             that length of time.


          (5) If any question arises for the purposes of  this  Part  as  to
          whether a person is a  British  citizen,  it  is  for  the  person
          asserting that fact to prove it."


   10. This is not a deportation appeal and so the provisions  referring  to
       foreign criminals have no application.


   11. Section 117B (1) is said to have been  recognised  by  the  Judge  in
       paragraph 15 of the determination but the analyses of the same is not
       sufficient. The  statement  in  the  section  reflects  the  view  of
       Parliament as to the public interest.


   12. Section 117B (2) is met as Mr Odeyemi has been in the United  kingdom
       since the age of twelve and has been educated here. He is an  English
       speaker.


   13. Section 117B (3) requires the person seeking entry or to remain to be
       financial independent. The wording of the section is important as  it
       specifically refers to the applicant  being  financially  independent
       but does not suggest that such cannot  be  achieved  by  reliance  on
       third party funds, although in such a case it will have to be  proved
       that such funding is realistic and sustainable to the required  level
       to prevent any reliance upon public funds, to avoid becoming a burden
       upon the taxpayer, and in assisting in integration.  The  appropriate
       level of funds may  be  that  used  to  assess  independence  in  the
       Immigration Rules which can be variable.  In this respect Mr  Odeyemi
       is not independent as he has been engaged in studies  although  these
       are not being undertaken at the present time whilst  his  immigration
       status is being resolved. He and his sister have been visited  almost
       annually in the UK by their mother who has  funded  his  studies.  Mr
       Odeyemi is dependant upon  such  support  and  upon  his  sister  for
       accommodation.  There  was  no  evidence  before  the  First-tier  to
       establish the level of assets available or of a commitment to ongoing
       support at the required level.  It  was  submitted  on  Mr  Odeyemi's
       behalf that  he  wished  to  complete  his  studies  in  the  UK  and
       thereafter gain employment at which time he will be self  sufficient,
       which was said to be a realistic proposal in light  of  his  academic
       achievement. The difficulty for Mr Odeyemi is that he  is  unable  to
       work or settle in the UK unless his immigration  status  permits  and
       the wording of  the  section  is  in  the  present  tense,  i.e.  the
       applicant for leaves is financially independent, not  that  they  may
       become so in the future. At this  point  in  time  it  has  not  been
       established that this requirement of the section can be  met  on  the
       available evidence.


   14. Section 117(4) states that little weight should be given  to  private
       life or a relationship with a qualifying partner  established  during
       the time the applicant has been in the UK unlawfully. Mr Odeyemi  has
       formed a private life and even if he was  not  responsible  for  what
       happened in the past he is an overstayer and has been in the  country
       illegally for the majority of the time  he  has  been  here.  It  was
       argued by Mr Braier that this sub-section is of little  relevance  as
       Mr Odeyemi has  lived  with  his  sister  and  the  Judge  found  the
       relationship between them to be  one  with  the  required  degree  of
       dependency such as to engage Article 8 family life.   The  submission
       that as this is family life and not private life the  sub-section  is
       not applicable is of interest although of  debatable  merit.  Section
       117A  specifically  states  that  these  provisions  apply   to   all
       situations in which the Tribunal is asked to determine  an  issue  of
       private and family act and in 117A(3) it is stated that  "the  public
       interest question" means the question of whether an interference with
       a persons right to respect for private and family life.  Whist  there
       can be excluded classes in legislative provisions, if  this  what  Mr
       Braier submits, the weight to be given to the private life element of
       his relationship with family members is regulated by statute  whereas
       the weight to be given to family life with family members who are not
       "qualifying partners" is not. If this was the intention of Parliament
       it appears somewhat strange although of no great consequence  overall
       as Strasbourg jurisprudence makes it clear that the weigh to be given
       to relationships formed when a person has no leave and  it  is  known
       their immigration status is precarious is reduced in any event.


   15. The Secretary of State also challenges the finding of  the  existence
       of family life recognised by Article 8 between  Mr  Odeyemi  and  his
       sister. The grounds assert that although Mr  Odeyemi  may  have  been
       living with his sister he has been living an independent life through
       his university studies supported by his mother and  sister  and  that
       the evidence demonstrated nothing other than normal emotional ties.


   16. In Kugathas v SSHD [2003] INLR 170,  the  case  referred  to  by  the
       Judge, the Court of Appeal said that in  order  to  establish  family
       life it is necessary to show  that  there  is  a  real  committed  or
       effective support or relationship between the family members and  the
       normal emotional ties between a mother and an adult  son  would  not,
       without more, be enough.


   17. Judge Somal found a close emotional bond between Mr Odeyemi  and  his
       sister and nephew with whom he had lived for several years  and  that
       as a result their emotional bond went beyond that of  normal  sibling
       ties.  In Nadarajah Senthuran [2004] EWCA Civ 950 the Court of Appeal
       said that Advic v UK was  not  authority  for  the  proposition  that
       Article 8 could never be engaged  when  the  family  concerned  adult
       children living together.  The  Court  remitted  the  appeal  to  the
       Tribunal to reconsider the issue of family life in the light  of  the
       fact that the appellant was aged 17 on arrival; he had lived with his
       siblings consistently since arrival; more than 4  years  had  elapsed
       between the application  and  the  refusal  letter  (an  unreasonable
       period); he lived in a close family with siblings and his mother; and
       he had no family in Sri Lanka where he had been tortured in the past.


   18. Also, in Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy)  [2012]  UKUT
       00160 (IAC) the Tribunal said that  a  review  of  the  jurisprudence
       discloses that there is no general proposition  that  Article  8  can
       never be engaged when the family life it is sought  to  establish  is
       between adult  siblings  living  together.  Rather  than  applying  a
       blanket rule with regard to  adult  children,  each  case  should  be
       analysed on its own facts, to  decide  whether  or  not  family  life
       exists,  within  the  meaning   of   Article   8(1).  Whilst   some
       generalisations are possible, each case is fact-sensitive.


   19. Mr McVeety challenges the finding of the Judge by  reference  to  the
       fact the evidence showed the ties between Mr Odeyemi and  his  sister
       are not exceptional or beyond the norm.  Some support is  gained  for
       this proposition by the failure of Judge Somal  to  provide  adequate
       reasons to support her conclusions other than  by  reference  to  the
       fact they lived in the same household and their immigration  history.
       There is a need to prove there is an exceptional relationship between
       siblings. The finding  by  Judge  Somal  in  paragraph  19  that  the
       emotional bonds goes beyond normal ties as adults is noted  but  that
       is expected when there is a sibling relationship.  It  has  not  been
       found the relationship as siblings contains the  additional  elements
       of dependency required to satisfy the test. In Etti-Adegbola  v  SSHD
       (2009) EWCA Civ 1319 the claimant, a citizen of Nigeria, came to  the
       UK in 1997 as a minor.  In 2005 he applied to remain on human  rights
       grounds as the over age dependent of his mother  who  had  been  here
       since 1987. She had high blood pressure and it was  argued  that  his
       removal would be detrimental to her health.   The  claimant  and  his
       mother lived in one household with the claimant young adult  brother.
       The boys were not financially dependant on  their  mother,  but  were
       helpful and supportive as members of a family living together usually
       were and  emotional  ties  undoubtedly  existed.   Although  in  some
       respects the situation appeared to be covered by expressions used  in
       Strasbourg jurisprudence such as "real and effective family ties" and
       "committed relationship" the Strasbourg  jurisprudence  did  not  all
       point in that direction.  The relevant test was that applied  by  the
       Tribunal; namely that the behaviour was "no way exceptional or beyond
       the norm".  The Court upheld the Tribunal's finding that there was no
       Article 8(1) family life.


   20. Mr Odeyemi has remained  dependant  financially  on  his  mother  who
       supports him and who visits. There is no evidence she  abandoned  her
       children when they were brought to  the  UK  or  has  not  taken  any
       interest or active role in their lives whilst they were growing up.


   21. In any event, the relationship between Mr Odeyemi and his sister is a
       strong element of their respective private lives and as found in AA v
       United Kingdom  (Application  no.  8000/08)  ECtHR  (Fourth  Section)
       (2011) the test is the same when assessing the proportionality of any
       interference with a protected right, whether  of  family  or  private
       life.


   22. As demonstrated by the discussion in relation to section 117  at  the
       hearing and as set out above there is more  to  this  case  than  the
       determination suggests. The fact Mr Odeyemi may not be able  to  meet
       all the requirements of 117 is, however, not  determinative  as  this
       section only sets out Parliament's view of how  the  public  interest
       should be assessed and there is still the need to conduct a balancing
       exercise to assess the proportionality of the decision.


   23. Judge Somal set out Mr Odeyemi's immigration  history  which  is  not
       disputed. The fact he has been in the United Kingdom for some time is
       not of itself determinative. He lived in Nigeria for twelve years and
       it is conceded he is  unable  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules. These include paragraph  276ADE  which  permits  a
       person to remain on private life grounds if they  have  twenty  years
       residence or a lesser period if there are very significant  obstacles
       to his integration. Mr Odeyemi has family in  Nigeria  including  his
       mother who provides support.  Although he will have to  re-adjust  it
       has not been shown this is not possible or that  the  effect  of  the
       same is such as to be determinative.


   24. Mr Braier referred in his submissions  to  the  basic  principles  of
       Article 8 considered by Judge Somal. It is worth reminding  ourselves
       of these as the European Court of Human Rights recently  did  in  the
       case of Biao v Denmark  [2014]  ECHR  304  on  25th  March  2014.  At
       paragraphs 52 and 53 of that judgment the Court found:


       52.    The Court notes that the essential object of Article 8  is  to
          protect the individual against  arbitrary  action  by  the  public
          authorities. There  may  in  addition  be  a  positive  obligation
          inherent in effective "respect" for private and family life  (see,
          for example, S�derman v.  Sweden  [GC],  no.  5786/08,  � 78,  12
          November 2013). In the  context  of  both  positive  and  negative
          obligations the State must  strike  a  fair  balance  between  the
          competing interests of the individual and of the  community  as  a
          whole. However, in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin
          of appreciation (see, inter alia, Osman v. Denmark, no.  38058/09,
          � 53, 14 June 2011). The present  case  concerns  the  refusal  to
          grant the second applicant family reunion in  Denmark.  Therefore,
          this case is to be seen as one involving an allegation of  failure
          on the part of the respondent State  to  comply  with  a  positive
          obligation (Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v.  the  Netherlands,
          no. 50435/99, � 38, ECHR 2006-I).


       53.    The Court reiterates that a State is entitled, as a matter  of
          well-established international  law  and  subject  to  its  treaty
          obligations, to control the entry of aliens into its territory and
          their  residence  there  (see,  among  many   other   authorities,
          Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom,  judgment
          of 28 May 1985, �  67,  Series  A  no.  94,  Boujlifa  v. France,
          judgment of 21 October  1997,  �  42,  Reports  of  Judgments  and
          Decisions 1997-VI). Moreover, Article  8  does  not      entail  a
          general obligation for a State to respect  immigrants'  choice  of
          the country of their residence and to authorise family reunion  in
          its territory.  Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life
          as well as immigration, the extent of  a  State's  obligations  to
          admit to its territory relatives of persons  residing  there  will
          vary according to the  particular  circumstances  of  the  persons
          involved and the general  interest  (see,  for  example,  Butt  v.
          Norway, no. 47017/09, � 70, 4 December 2012; Antwi and Others v.
          Norway, no. 26940/10, �� 88-89, 14 February 2012; Nunez v. Norway,
          no. 55597/09, �� 66-70, 28 June 2011; Darren Omoregie and Others
          v. Norway, no. 265/07, � 64, 31 July 2008; Rodrigues da Silva and
          Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands, cited above, � 39 and  �  43,  ECHR
          2006-I; Priya v. Denmark (dec.), 13549/03, 6 July 2006 and G�l v.
          Switzerland,  judgment  of  19 February  1996,  Reports  1996-I).
          Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to
          which family life is effectively ruptured, the extent of the  ties
          in  the  Contracting  State,  whether  there  are   insurmountable
          obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin
          of  one  or  more  of  them  and  whether  there  are  factors  of
          immigration  control  (for  example,  a  history  of  breaches  of
          immigration law) or considerations of  public  order  weighing  in
          favour of exclusion (see Rodrigues da Silva and  Hoogkamer,  cited
          above;  Ajayi  and  Others  v.  the  United  Kingdom  (dec.),  no.
          27663/95, 22 June 1999; Solomon v. the  Netherlands  (dec.),  no.
          44328/98, 5 September 2000). Another  important  consideration  is
          whether family life  was  created  at  a  time  when  the  persons
          involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them was
          such that the persistence of that  family  life  within  the  host
          State would from the  outset  be  precarious  (see  Jerry  Olajide
          Sarumi v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 43279/98, 26 January 1999
          and Andrey Sheabashov v.  Latvia  (dec.),  no.  50065/99,  22 May
          1999). Where this is the case  the  removal  of  the  non-national
          family member  would  be  incompatible  with  Article  8  only  in
          exceptional circumstances (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and  Balkandali,
          cited above, � 68; Mitchell v.  the  United  Kingdom  (dec.),  no.
          40447/98, 24 November 1998, and Ajayi and Others, cited above; and
          Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above).


   25. It is accordance with the margin of appreciation that  the  Secretary
       of State has introduced  into  UK  domestic  provisions  the  revised
       Immigration Rules from July 2012 and now section 117. The Rules  have
       been held to be legal and all challenges to them suggesting otherwise
       have failed.  They  require  appropriate  weight  to  be  accordingly
       attached to them.


   26. I accept Mr Odeyemi has been  a  law  abiding  citizen  but  that  is
       expected of him.  The  reward  of  bad  behaviour  such  as  acts  of
       criminality is deportation. The  expectation  of  society  for  those
       living in the UK is that they will behave in a civilised  and  lawful
       manner as Mr Odeyemi has.


   27. Mr Odeyemi is now 22 years of age.  He no longer lives with his  aunt
       as his sister has moved to Northamptonshire and  he  currently  lives
       with her in her house. His sister had one child at the  date  of  the
       previous hearing and her husband worked  away  although  Mr  Braier's
       submitted that she now has another child and is a  single  parent  as
       she and her husband have separated. It  is  also  submitted  that  Mr
       Odeyemi also fulfils the role of a  father  figure  to  his  sister's
       children. If this is the case it must be accepted Mr Odeyemi plays an
       additional role  in  his  sister's  family  of  providing  additional
       support  and  assistance  although  insufficient  evidence  has  been
       provided to demonstrate that his sister is unable  to  care  for  the
       children in his absence.  His not being present to the same extent as
       currently will be the case if he returned to education in  Nottingham
       or elsewhere to complete his degree course. The best interests of the
       children have not been shown to be other than to  remain  with  their
       mother and it has not been shown they will not receive  the  standard
       of case required to meet their basic needs if Mr Odeyemi  is  removed
       or the children  suffer  consequences  that  will  make  his  removal
       disproportionate. Other family members remain in the UK and statutory
       services are no doubt available if required.


   28. In relation to the desire to continue his studies, Mr Odeyemi is  not
       a British citizen and has no right  to  be  educated  in  the  United
       Kingdom. Whilst I accept that the case is not advanced on  the  basis
       of an implied right to education, the reality is that he cannot study
       unless he has permission to do so, which he does not. The application
       is an attempt to secure such status through Article 8 to allow him to
       remain to complete his studies and beyond.  One  issue  he  faces  in
       relation to this element is that Article 8 does not allow a person to
       choose where they wish to live. There was also discussion during  the
       hearing in relation to the ability of Mr Odeyemi to return to Nigeria
       and apply for entry clearance to re-enter as a Tier 4 Student if this
       was his wish. He is funded by his mother who has  paid  his  fees  to
       date, he has the support of his university, and the Tribunal was  not
       referred to any provision that  would  prevent  such  an  application
       being made. It has also not been shown that if Mr Odeyemi  wishes  to
       study he cannot do so in Nigeria although I accept  he  may  have  to
       start a course again unless a dispensation is granted.


   29. Mr Braier referred to the case of CDS (PBS: "available":  Article  8)
       Brazil [2010] UKUT 00305 (IAC) in  which  the  Tribunal  acknowledged
       that "people who have been  admitted  on  a  course  of  study  at  a
       recognised UK institution for higher education, are likely  to  build
       up a  relevant  connection  with  the  course,  the  institution,  an
       educational sequence  for  the  ultimate  professional  qualification
       sought,  as  well  as  social  ties  during  the  period  of   study.
       Cumulatively this may amount to private life  that  deserves  respect
       because the person has been admitted for this  purpose,  the  purpose
       remains  unfilled,   and   discretionary   factors   such   as   mis-
       representation or criminal conduct  have  not  provided  grounds  for
       refusal of extension or curtailment of stay."


   30. CDS is a case in which the Appellants had leave to remain but had  to
       apply for further leave as the period of existing leave ended  before
       her course. It was found in that  case  that  as  there  was  only  a
       relatively short period of time remaining it was disproportionate  on
       a private life basis not to enable CDS  to  remain  to  complete  the
       course. Following the introduction of section 117B the problem for Mr
       Odeyemi is that he has never had leave to study and the course he has
       completed is part of his private life on which little weight  can  be
       placed. He has also only completed two years and has at least another
       year to go.


   31. It was accepted before the Upper Tribunal that Mr Odeyemi has:


       (a)    a voluntary return option


       (b)    an option to return to Nigeria and apply for leave to enter as
       a Tier 4 student migrant.


       (c)    there is no proven adverse funding issue in relation  to  such
       an application


       (d)    there is no evidence his university will not  support  him  in
       such an application


       (e)    he is able to explain his presence in the UK illegally to date
       by reference to the actions of his father as accepted by Judge Somal


   32. Mr Odeyemi is clearly  an  intelligent  individual  who  may  not  be
       responsible for his father's actions but that does not entitle him to
       bypass the law. If he returns and succeeds with  an  application  his
       absence will be relatively short. If he does not  succeed  that  does
       not make the decision disproportionate.


   33. This is not a case in which it has been shown removal will result  in
       unjustifiable harsh consequences for any member of this  family  such
       as to enable the  Upper  Tribunal  to  find  this  is  one  of  those
       exceptional cases where  the  decision  is  not  proportionate.  When
       considering whether the United Kingdom authorities have struck a fair
       balance between the competing interests of Mr Odeyemi and his  family
       in the UK and the community  as  a  whole,  I  find  they  have.  The
       decision is proportionate.

Decision

   34. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law.  I  set  aside
       the decision of the original Judge. I remake the decision as follows.
       This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


   35. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005. I make no such order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
