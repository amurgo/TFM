                          Determination and Reasons
Representation:Miss S Iqbal (counsel instructed by Anooma & Co) for Rama.
Miss G Thompson (counsel instructed by Andrews) for Buba. Mr J Harper for
the Secretary of State
These are appeals, with leave, from decisions of adjudicators on appeals by
Albanian citizens of the former Kosovo autonomous province of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, as follows:
a) Mr ACB Markham David, sitting at Swan St on 10 April, allowing an asylum
and human rights appeal from directions for removal as an illegal entrant
on 31 January;
b) Mr M Rush, sitting at Swan St on 12 January, dismissing an asylum appeal
from directions for removal as an illegal entrant on 28 April 2000.
Both appeals raise essentially the same question, so we heard them
together. It is whether there is now any scope for finding real risk on
return to Kosovo for someone who has deserted from, or refused to join the
former KLA. Other questions arise on each, to which we shall come in due
course. The grant of leave to Buba suggests that the adjudicator appeared
not to have made a credibility finding; but he did say
"...the overwhelming objective evidence [is] totally against anything that
the appellant has produced either in relation to his subjective fear or in
relation to the objective situation."
2. The most recent and authoritative evidence on whether or not there is
risk for such a reason comes in the UNHCR updated position paper of March
2001, read together with its predecessor. What is conspicuous by its
absence in the March paper (under the heading of 'Persons with Special
Protection Needs', where it used to appear) is any mention of a risk from
the former KLA. The reason can be seen from the summary of the previous
evidence at paragraph 6.30 of the Home Office country assessment (April
2001): the only two incidents described, neither of the greatest
seriousness, date back to 1999, and the UNHCR had been reduced to
speculating that numerous other cases had gone unreported. No doubt it was
realized that no suggestion of any general risk to "draft evaders" or
"deserters" from the former KLA was any longer viable.
3. In the case of Rama, the adjudicator found his expressed fear of
punishment for refusing to join the KLA (at some time before he came here
in September 1998) was well-founded; but this was on the basis of the
previous UNHCR position paper, of March 2000. Clearly that finding cannot
stand; nor could any equivalent one now be made. The human rights claim in
Rama did not add anything to the merits of the appellant's case on the
facts, but stood or fell with the asylum one. Miss Iqbal argued that Rama
might be seen as a collaborator with the Serbs; but the only basis for that
was his refusal to join the KLA, and UNHCR cannot have meant to include
that as a ground for risk by the back door, while shutting it out by the
front. Her other argument was that he faced a particular risk from the KLA,
having been asked to join it by an elder in his own village. We do not see
that this would make any present fear he had well-founded; but, if it did,
then there is nothing to make it unduly harsh for a healthy single man of
27 to stay in Pri?tina, to where he would be returned.
4. The same result must follow on Buba's main claim, to fear persecution
for failing to join the KLA. This was highly dubious even before the latest
UNHCR report: as the adjudicator pointed out, Buba had managed to stay in
his village till March 2000. We think the adjudicator was right at the time
in the credibility finding he made (see paragraph 1 above), and doubly
justified by the view UNHCR have now taken. There is another point taken in
Buba's case, which is that he is at risk because of being a Roman Catholic.
He himself conceded before the adjudicator that he never had had any
trouble for that reason; but Miss Thompson argued that there was
nevertheless a real risk of it. This was based on two documents. The first
is a photocopy of a letter (bundle pp 5-6) from the London office of UNHCR
to the Home Office: it has been so badly done (we hope not deliberately)
that the date is nowhere to be seen, and Miss Thompson realistically
conceded that it cannot be inferred from the contents. That is the most
crucial point in a developing situation of this kind, and we declined to
take any notice of this effectively undated document. The other document is
the March 2000 UNHCR position paper, which does say (its page 13)
Although there is no clear cut evidence of Catholic Albanians being
persecuted specifically on religious grounds, there may be certain areas
within Kosovo where Catholic Albanians are likely to come under suspicion
for collaboration, and where they are therefore at risk.
First there is no evidence to suggest, in the absence of any previous
trouble, that Buba's home area was such a one; but what is more, this
passage has not been reproduced in the March 2001 position paper, and it
must follow that UNHCR no longer see any real risk from this source.
