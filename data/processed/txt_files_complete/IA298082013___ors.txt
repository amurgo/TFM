                         UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE KEBEDE

                                   Between

                              Mr Ravinder Batth
                              Mrs Mahak Sharma

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr J Waithe, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. These are three appeals brought by the appellants against a decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 25 March 2014.  By that decision
    the First-tier Tribunal dismissed an appeal against  decisions  of  the
    respondent who had refused them leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    and also included a decision to remove them from  the  United  Kingdom.
    The three appellants appealed against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted in relation to one point only,  namely
    that the decision refusing leave to remain and the  decision  that  the
    appellants should be removed were both included in  the  same  document
    and were made at the same time. It was said that that was  contrary  to
    the former provision contained in Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.  Under the old law if that were  the  case  a
    decision to remove would it seems be invalid.

 3. Here, however, the decisions were all taken after 8 May  2013  and  the
    significance of that date is this.  Section 51 of the Crime and  Courts
    Act 2013 came into force on 8 May 2013.  It substituted a  new  Section
    47 for the old Section 47 and under the new 47 where the  Secretary  of
    State gives notice of a decision refusing to vary a person's  leave  to
    enter or remain in the United Kingdom the Secretary of State  may  also
    at the same time give notice of a decision that the  person  is  to  be
    removed from the United Kingdom.  That Act applies to  decisions  taken
    after it came into force, that is decisions after 8 May 2013.  In those
    circumstances this appeal must have failed.

 4. Mr Waithe on behalf  of  the  Appellants  very  fairly  and  reasonably
    conceded at the outset that these decisions were all taken  on  7  July
    2013, at a time when the new Section 47 was in place, and under the new
    Section 47 it was permissible to include both the  decision  to  refuse
    leave to remain and the decision to remove.

 5. I would pay tribute to Mr Waithe for the very sensible way in which  he
    accepted that immediately at the outset  of  this  appeal  and  we  are
    grateful to him for the assistance that he has given  to  the  Tribunal
    today but for those reasons this appeal is dismissed.






Signed                                  Date


Mr Justice Lewis
