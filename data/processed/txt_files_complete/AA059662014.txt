ANONYMITY

I maintain the anonymity direction made at first instance  and  give  effect
to this by describing the Appellant by the use of initials above.

                                  DECISION

INTRODUCTION

 1. This appeal originates in a decision made on behalf of the Secretary of
    State  for  the  Home  Department  (the  "Secretary  of  State"),   the
    Respondent herein, dated 01 August 2014,  whereby  the  claims  of  the
    Appellant,  a  national  of  Uganda  aged  25  years,  for  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection were rejected.  The Appellant's ensuing  appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT") was dismissed.

 2. The cornerstone of the Appellant's asylum claim is her asserted lesbian
    sexuality.  She further based her claim on  the  homophobic  nature  of
    Ugandan society which is manifested in, inter alia, the  amended  Penal
    Code Act of 1950, whereby sexual relations which are "against the order
    of nature" is an offence punishable by life imprisonment, coupled  with
    the more recent legislation..  The Appellant's  claim  for  asylum  was
    refused by the Secretary of State because it  was  disbelieved  in  all
    material  respects.   Fundamentally,  the  assertion  of  her   lesbian
    sexuality was  considered  untrue.   On  appeal,  the  FtT  upheld  the
    Secretary of State's decision and, in doing so, adopted several of  its
    key findings.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted on the twofold grounds  that  the  FtT
    had arguably erred in law in respect of the fairness of the Appellant's
    hearing and the rational sustainability of certain  findings.   I  gave
    judgment at the conclusion of  the  hearing  allowing  the  Appellant's
    appeal for the following reasons, in summary.

 4. The crucial passage in the determination of  the  FtT  is  [17].   This
    begins with the Judge's overarching conclusion:

         "I have not found the Appellant to be a credible  witness  for  the
         following reasons ...."


    This is followed by  nine  separate  subparagraphs.   These  contain  a
    mixture  of  findings  of  facts  per  se  and  matters  of  evaluative
    assessment.  The Judge's listed "reasons" included the following:


    (a)  A lack  of  corroboration  of  the  Appellant's  case  from  three
         specified sources -  her  former  school,  her  grandmother  and  a
         relative.


    (b)  The absence of "difficulties with the authorities" in Uganda at  a
         "much earlier" stage.

    (c)  The failure of the police to take  action  against  the  Appellant
         following an incident described by her.

    (d)  The implausibility of the Appellant being able to secure a  second
         level educational qualification in Uganda.

    (e)  The absence of any evidence of active lesbian relationships during
         the Appellant's sojourn of approximately 21 months  in  the  United
         Kingdom.


    It is not disputed that none of these factors either formed part of the
    Secretary of State's decision or  was  put  to  the  Appellant  or  was
    otherwise canvassed during the hearing.  Giving  effect  to  elementary
    fairness principles, I consider that the conclusion that the  Appellant
    was denied her common law right to a fair hearing follows inexorably.

 5. The second ground of appeal relates to the rational  sustainability  of
    the reasons given by the FtT  for,  in  essence,  dismissing  a  letter
    bearing the date 28 March 2014 and on its face emanating from  a  local
    Council in Uganda as a fabrication.  The addressee of the letter is the
    Appellant's grandmother.  The letter is stamped and  purports  to  bear
    the signature of the Chairman of the Council in question.  The contents
    of the letter  arouse  some  interest  and,  in  my  judgment,  it  was
    incumbent on the FtT to engage with them in assessing the  authenticity
    of the document.  It was also incumbent on the Tribunal  to  take  into
    account the evidence of the new homosexuality  laws  in  Uganda,  which
    create a duty of denunciation of  offenders,  together  with  the  Home
    Office CIG report and the "Sexual Minorities" report.  These  were  all
    sources of evidence bearing on the discrete issue of whether the letter
    was authentic.  There is no indication, express or  oblique,  that  the
    Tribunal took them into account.  This per se constitutes an  error  of
    law.  Furthermore, viewed through a  somewhat,  though  not  radically,
    different lens I concur with the  submission  of  Mr  Hoshi  that  this
    reason is unsustainable as irrational.  I  further  consider  that  the
    absence of evidence of  homosexual  relations  during  the  Appellant's
    sojourn in the United Kingdom  did  not,  without  more,  constitute  a
    rational freestanding reason for disbelieving her claim.

ORDER

 6. For the reasons elaborated above, the decision of  the  FtT  cannot  be
    sustained and I order:

    (a)  The decision of the FtT is set aside.

         (b)  Given that the Appellant  was  deprived  of  a  fair  hearing,
remittal is appropriate.

    (c)  I remit the appeal to a differently constituted FtT for  rehearing
         and fresh decision.

    (d)  Any application for the adduction of fresh evidence will  be  made
         at least 14 days in advance of the further hearing.






















    I record that, at the appeal hearing,  I  received,  without  objection
    from either party, copies of Counsel's note of  the  hearing  at  first
    instance,  a  letter  dated  13  January  2015  from  the   Appellant's
    solicitors conceding the merits of her complaint about certain  aspects
    of the handling of her first instance appeal and offering  compensation
    of ï¿½600 and, finally,  the  Home  Office  CIG  report  "Uganda:  Sexual
    Orientation and Gender Identity", dated August 2014.
