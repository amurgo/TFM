 For the Appellant:        Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:        Mr E Akohene, Solicitor



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1.   The Secretary of State appeals with permission against a decision of
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Norton-Taylor allowing Ms  Amankwah's
      appeal against the decision to refuse to issue Ms Amankwah a residence
      card in acknowledgement of her right of residence as a  family  member
      of an EEA national.  Although  the  Secretary  of  State  is  now  the
      appellant in this appeal and Ms Amankwah is the respondent, it is more
      convenient to refer to the parties as they were before the  First-tier
      Tribunal. I shall refer to Ms Amankwah as "the appellant" from now  on
      and the Secretary of State as "the respondent".


   2.   I was not asked and saw no reason to make an anonymity direction.


   3. The appellant applied for a residence card on 21 August  2013  through
      her representatives. She relied on her proxy  marriage  to  Mr  Thomas
      Halley Hanson, a Spanish national, said to have taken place  in  Ghana
      on 7 July 2012. Relying  on  NA  (customary  marriage  and  divorce  -
      evidence) Ghana [2009] UKAIT 00009, the respondent was  not  satisfied
      the marriage was valid according to Ghanaian law. In  particular,  the
      refusal reasoned that both parties to  the  marriage  must  be  either
      Ghanaian citizens or be able to demonstrate  that  their  parents  are
      Ghanaian citizens. The respondent did not accept, in the  alternative,
      that the appellant and  Mr  Hanson  were  in  a  durable  relationship
      because they had not provided sufficient evidence. The  appellant  was
      refused a residence card by reference to Regulations 7 and 8(5) of the
      Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, as amended.


   4. The appellant submitted grounds of appeal which  argued  the  marriage
      was valid. Reliance was placed on  CB  (Validity  of  marriage:  proxy
      marriage) Brazil [2008] UKAIT 00080. The grounds made  no  mention  of
      Regulation 8(5). The  grounds  argued  in  the  alternative  that  the
      decision breached article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.


   5.   The appellant requested that her appeal be determined on the  papers
      without a hearing. Her representatives forwarded a bundle of 24  pages
      for consideration by the First-tier Tribunal. Judge Norton-Taylor also
      had the earlier determination of Judge Bircher, who  had  dismissed  a
      previous appeal on the basis the  statutory  declaration  produced  to
      evidence the customary marriage did not state the place  of  residence
      of the parties. A fresh statutory declaration had  been  prepared  for
      the renewed application.


   6.   In a clear and logical determination, Judge  Norton-Taylor  set  out
      his reasons for allowing the appeal. He noted there was no  allegation
      that any of the  documentation  produced  by  the  appellant  was  not
      genuine and he found the documents were genuine and reliable regarding
      their contents. He made the following primary findings of act:


     *    the appellant is Ghanaian;
     *    Mr Hanson was born in Ghana;
     *    it was highly likely Mr Hanson was a Ghanaian  national  at  least
         until he obtained his Spanish citizenship;
     *    Mr Hanson was a person with Ghanaian parents and Ghanaian descent;
     *    both the appellant and Mr Hanson  were  eligible  to  marry  under
         Ghanaian customary law;
     *    the witnesses to the marriage were the respective fathers  of  the
         couple;
     *    the new statutory declaration did state the place of residence  of
         the couple, namely London;
     *    the couple were resident in the UK at the date of their marriage;
     *    they were both free to marry as the appellant was a divorcï¿½e; and
     *    the marriage was valid and in accordance with Ghanaian law,  which
         was implicit from the documents issued by the authorities.

   7.    Judge Norton-Taylor concluded the appellant was married to  an  EEA
      national and was therefore his 'family member'. There was  no  dispute
      over the fact Mr Hanson was exercising Treaty rights  in  the  UK.  He
      found the appellant was entitled to a residence card and  allowed  the
      appeal. He  did  not  determine  whether  the  appellant  fell  within
      Regulation 8(5) or whether her removal in consequence of the  decision
      would breach article 8.


   8.   The respondent was granted  permission  to  appeal  because  it  was
      arguable that the judge erred. His conclusion was  not  in  accordance
      with the principles set out in  Kareem  (Proxy  marriages  -  EU  law)
      [2014] UKUT 00024 (IAC), which held that it was necessary to establish
      whether the marriage was recognised in Spain, the  EEA  State  of  the
      sponsor.


   9.   The appellant has not filed a Rule 24 response opposing the appeal.


  10. I should record that the appellant and Mr Hanson attended the hearing.
      A short bundle had been prepared in advance  of  the  hearing  by  the
      appellant's solicitors, presumably in case an error was found and  the
      Upper Tribunal re-heard the appeal.


  11. I heard submissions from the representatives as to whether  the  judge
      made a material error of law. Having done so, I decided the judge  did
      make a material error. My reasons are as follows.


  12. In Kareem the Upper Tribunal set out its conclusions in  paragraph  68
      as follows:



         "We make the following general observations.

          a. A person who is  the  spouse  of  an  EEA  national  who  is  a
             qualified person in the United Kingdom  can  derive  rights  of
             free  movement  and  residence  if   proof   of   the   marital
             relationship is provided.

          b. The production of a marriage certificate issued by a  competent
             authority (that is, issued according to the  registration  laws
             of the country where the marriage took place) will  usually  be
             sufficient.  If  not  in  English  (or  Welsh  in  relation  to
             proceedings in Wales), a certified translation of the  marriage
             certificate will be required.

          c. A document which calls itself a marriage certificate  will  not
             raise a presumption of  the  marriage  it  purports  to  record
             unless it has been issued by an authority with legal  power  to
             create or confirm the facts it attests.

          d. In appeals where there is no such marriage certificate or where
             there is doubt that a marriage certificate has been issued by a
             competent authority,  then  the  marital  relationship  may  be
             proved by other evidence.  This will require  the  Tribunal  to
             determine whether a marriage was contracted.

          e. In such an appeal, the starting point will be to decide whether
             a  marriage  was  contracted  between  the  appellant  and  the
             qualified person according to  the  national  law  of  the  EEA
             country of the qualified person's nationality.

          f. In all  such  situations,  when  resolving  issues  that  arise
             because of conflicts of law, proper respect must  be  given  to
             the qualified person's  rights  as  provided  by  the  European
             Treaties, including the right to marry and the rights  of  free
             movement and residence.

          g. It should be assumed that,  without  independent  and  reliable
             evidence about the recognition of the marriage under  the  laws
             of the EEA country and/or the country where the  marriage  took
             place, the Tribunal  is  likely  to  be  unable  to  find  that
             sufficient evidence has been provided to discharge  the  burden
             of proof.  Mere production of  legal  materials  from  the  EEA
             country or country  where  the  marriage  took  place  will  be
             insufficient evidence because they will rarely  show  how  such
             law  is  understood  or  applied  in  those  countries.    Mere
             assertions as to the effect of  such  laws  will,  for  similar
             reasons, carry no weight.

          h. These remarks apply solely to the question of whether a  person
             is a spouse for the purposes of EU law.  It does not relate  to
             other relationships  that  might  be  regarded  as  similar  to
             marriage, such as civil partnerships or durable relationships."



  13. In view of submissions made in a number  of  cases  since  Kareem  was
      promulgated to the effect that there was a two-stage  process  and  it
      was only necessary to consider the validity against the  laws  of  the
      EEA national's State if there was not clear evidence that the marriage
      lawfully contracted in the country in which it  had  been  contracted,
      the Upper Tribunal provided clarification in  TA  and  Others  (Kareem
      explained) Ghana [2014] UKUT 00316 (IAC) as follows:


         "Following the decision in Kareem (proxy marriages - EU law) [2014]
         UKUT  24,  the  determination  of  whether  there  is   a   marital
         relationship for the purposes of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
         2006 must always be examined in accordance with  the  laws  of  the
         Member State from which the Union citizen obtains nationality."


  14. It is right to point out the judge in this case was not alerted to the
      principles set out in Kareem. Nonetheless it is  clear  that  he  fell
      into error by not applying them. He did  not  make  a  finding  as  to
      whether the appellant's marriage would  be  recognised  under  Spanish
      law.


  15. Mr Akohene argued that the error  was  not  material.  He  did  so  by
      reference to evidence he produced at the hearing, which had  not  been
      served on the respondent, which he argued  demonstrated  that  Spanish
      law would recognise the marriage anyway. He produced two documents  in
      English which he had downloaded from the internet:


          (1)  the Preliminary Title of the Spanish Civil Code; and
         (2)  a  summary  of  its  provisions  taken   from   the   European
         Commission's European Judicial Website.


  16. It is fair to say that a reading of the materials lends support to  Mr
      Akohene's arguments. On the face of it, the Civil Code  provides  that
      Spanish nationals can marry outside Spain in accordance with  the  law
      of the place where the marriage is celebrated. It could well  be  that
      Ghanaian law would apply to  the  question  of  the  validity  of  the
      marriage. The position would be akin to the UK's attitude as explained
      in CB (Validity of  marriage:  proxy  marriage)  Brazil  [2008]  UKAIT
      00080, that a proxy marriage would be regarded as valid under  English
      law if it was valid under the law of the place where it took place.


  17. Whilst Mr Akohene is to  be  commended  for  his  research,  the  fact
      remains that I have no way of knowing whether these documents  reflect
      the current law or, better said,  the  law  as  at  the  date  of  the
      marriage. The copy of the Code is in English and  the  translation  is
      not certified. The situation is  precisely  that  encountered  by  the
      Upper Tribunal in Kareem (see paragraphs 14, 25, 29 and 68(g)). I have
      nothing to assist me with interpreting the Spanish Civil Code and,  as
      far as I can see, it says nothing about customary and proxy marriages.
       I am not therefore persuaded  by  the  available  evidence  that  the
      judge's error could not have been material because  the  appeal  would
      have had to have been allowed.


  18. Mr Akohene also sketched out a submission made by reference to Article
      24 of Directive 2004/38/EC on equal treatment. If I understood him, he
      argued  that  the  proxy  marriage  of  a  British  citizen  would  be
      recognised under English law and therefore  it  amounted  to  unlawful
      discrimination not to treat an EEA citizen in the same way. However, I
      think this argument is misconceived. The issue  here  is  whether  the
      appellant can establish an entitlement to a residence card, which  she
      can only do if she establishes she has contracted  a  valid  marriage.
      There is no infringement of equal treatment by requiring  that  to  be
      done by reference to the party's own national laws.


  19. I must set aside the decision of Judge  Norton-Taylor  insofar  as  he
      concludes the marriage is valid and the appellant  is  entitled  to  a
      residence card. I see  no  reason  to  disturb  any  of  the  positive
      findings he made with regards  to  the  documents  and  Ghanaian  law.
      However, in order to establish an entitlement, the appellant will need
      to address the Kareem issue with cogent  evidence.  It  will  also  be
      necessary  to  examine  and  make  findings  on  the  issue   of   the
      relationship so as to be able to answer the question whether,  in  the
      alternative, the appellant and Mr Hanson are in a durable relationship
      so as to fall within Regulation 8(5). The parties  were  in  agreement
      that this is an appropriate case to remit to the  First-tier  Tribunal
      for these findings to be made.


  20. Having considered the Senior  President's  Practice  Direction  of  15
      September 2012, I make an  order  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  of  the
      Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The appeal will be reheard
      in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  To  assist,  I  make   the   following
      directions:


         (1)  The parties should file and serve evidence on the question  of
         whether the appellant's marriage is recognized under Spanish law;
         (2)  The appellant should file and serve evidence on  the  question
         of whether she and Mr Hanson are in a durable relationship;
         (3)  All evidence filed must be received by the  Tribunal  and  the
         other party no later than ten days before the hearing date;
         (4)  The findings of Judge Norton-Taylor set  out  in  bullet-point
         form in paragraph 6 above are preserved;
         (5)     The parties are reminded that the Tribunal will be assisted
         by skeleton arguments filed and served in advance of the hearing.
         (6)  The appeal will take the form of an oral  hearing  unless  the
         appellant indicates within  7  days  of  receiving  the  notice  of
         hearing that she wishes the  appeal  to  be  determined  without  a
         hearing; and
         (7)  If an interpreter is required, the Tribunal must  be  notified
         within 7 days of receiving the notice of  hearing  the  language(s)
         required.


DECISION

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a material error of  law  and
    his decision allowing the appeal is set aside.

     The appeal will be re-heard in the First-tier Tribunal at a  place  and
    on a date to be notified.
