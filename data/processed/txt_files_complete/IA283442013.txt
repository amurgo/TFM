For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant,  a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  born  on  17  January  1983,
    appealed against a decision made on 26 June 2013 to refuse to vary  his
    leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant.   The  reason  given  by  the  respondent  for  refusing   the
    appellant's application concerned access to funds made available to the
    appellant by Mr Hassan Arshad.  A  third  party  declaration  from  the
    latter, regarding access to funds of �25,000, was not acceptable to the
    respondent because it did not confirm Mr Arshad's relationship  to  the
    appellant or confirm that funds would be available until such  time  as
    transferred to the appellant.  In addition, bank  statements  were  not
    acceptable because the relevant bank account was not in the appellant's
    name; there was no declaration from a legal representative  to  confirm
    the letter of permission supplied was  valid;  and  no  letter  from  a
    financial  institution  in  which  Mr  Arshad's  funds  were  held,  to
    establish that funds were accessible by the appellant.   All  this  led
    the respondent to conclude that the appellant  had  not  supplied  "the
    specified evidence as listed under paragraph 41-SD [of  Appendix  A  to
    the Immigration Rules] to establish that you have access to  the  funds
    that you are claiming".   Accordingly,  pursuant  to  paragraph  41  of
    Appendix A, the appellant was not considered to have  access  to  those
    funds.

2.   The refusal letter went on to state that a decision had been made  "not
    to request  additional  documentation  or  exceptionally  consider  the
    application under the provisions  of  paragraph  245AA  as  it  is  not
    anticipated that addressing the omission or error would lead to a grant
    of leave".

3.    The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against   the
    respondent's refusal.  His appeal was  heard  at  Taylor  House  on  29
    January 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Brenells.  At paragraph 10 of
    the  resulting  determination,  the  judge  noted  that  the  appellant
    accepted that he did not submit with his application the required legal
    declaration confirming the signatures on the funds letter dated 20  May
    2013.  However, both that and  other  documents  were  submitted  under
    cover of a letter delivered to the respondent on 17 June 2013.

4.   The judge concluded that  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v Raju & Others [2013]  EWCA
    Civ 754 was authority for the proposition that material submitted after
    the date of the application could be considered.  He further held  that
    paragraph 245AA of the Immigration  Rules  did  not  apply,  since  the
    appellant had not submitted a "specified document".

5.    Before  me,  there  was  a  wide  measure  of  agreement  between  the
    representatives.  There was nothing in the case  of  Raju  or,  indeed,
    section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  which
    precluded the judge from considering  the  material  submitted  by  the
    appellant to the respondent after  the  date  of  the  application  but
    before  the  respondent  reached  her  decision.    Accordingly,   much
    potentially turned upon the  application  of  paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  At the relevant time, paragraph 245AA was in a form
    which, Mr Jarvis accepted, would have covered certain of  the  material
    submitted after the date of application and in practice  considered  by
    the respondent before she reached  her  decision.   However,  paragraph
    245AA(c) stated that the respondent "will not request documents where a
    specified document has not been submitted... or  where  the  UK  Border
    Agency does not  anticipate  that  addressing  the  omission  or  error
    referred to in sub-paragraph (b) will  lead  to  a  grant  because  the
    application will be refused for other reasons".

6.   The problematic document was, Mr Jarvis contended, to be found at  page
    67 of the appellant's bundle.  It is a letter dated 6  June  2013  from
    the manager of the Habib Bank in Pakistan, concerning funds of  �27,000
    said to be available for the appellant from the account of a  Mr  Bilal
    Murtaza.  Mr Jarvis pointed out that paragraph 41-SD(4) of  Appendix  A
    required this document, if it was to be  relied  upon,  to  "have  been
    produced within the three months immediately before the  date  of  your
    application".  Since the letter post-dated the application (made on  23
    May 2013),  it  could  not  satisfy  the  Rules  and,  given  that  the
    appellant's case depended upon reliance being placed upon this  letter,
    paragraph 245AA(c) made it plain that that paragraph  could  not  avail
    the appellant.

7.   Mr Saini, however, initially submitted that it was  not  necessary  for
    the appellant  to  rely  on  the  letter  of  6  June  since  he  could
    demonstrate compliance with the financial requirements of the Rules  by
    reference to United Kingdom bank accounts.  At page 72 of  the  bundle,
    there is a letter dated 12 June 2013 from Halifax Bank of  Scotland  to
    Mr Arshad, informing the latter that he had �26, 418.48 in his account.
     However, Mr Saini later accepted that this letter of 12 June did  not,
    in fact, dispense with the appellant's need to rely upon the letter  of
    6 June and the bank statements attached to it.  Mr Saini submitted that
    it was the bank accounts themselves, rather than the enclosing  letter,
    that had to have been produced within three months  immediately  before
    the date of the application.

8.   I  consider  it  plain  that  paragraph  41-SD(i)(4)  cannot  bear  the
    construction contended for by  Mr  Saini.   It  is  manifest  from  the
    wording of that provision that it is  the  letter  from  the  financial
    institution holding the funds, which must have been produced within the
    relevant three month period.

9.   Mr Saini, with his customary energy and diligence,  submitted,  in  the
    alternative, that the particular requirement highlighted by  Mr  Jarvis
    had not featured in the  respondent's  reasons  for  refusal.   In  the
    circumstances, Mr Saini submitted that that provision of the Rules had,
    in reality been waived by the respondent.   For  this  proposition,  Mr
    Saini relied upon the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department ex-parte Khan [1980] 2 All ER 337.  In
    that habeas corpus case Lord Denning,  in  what  appear  to  have  been
    obiter remarks,  held  that  a  person  being  asked  questions  by  an
    Immigration Officer was under no duty to volunteer the information that
    he had subsequently married, in  the  absence  of  questions  or  other
    enquiries from the Immigration Officer.

10.  I am unable to accept Mr Saini's submission  regarding  ex-parte  Khan.
    Lord Denning's proposition, arising in a habeas corpus  case,  was  not
    relied upon by the other judges (Lawton and Ackner LJJ).  But,  in  any
    event, in an appeal under the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002, where the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal except insofar  as  it
    finds that the decision under challenge was not in accordance with  the
    law (including immigration rules), the relevant authority  is  Kwok  on
    Tong (R v IAT & another ex-parte Kwok  on  Tong)  [1981]  Imm  AR  214.
    Subject to issues of procedural fairness, even if  an  appellant  shows
    that he met a particular requirement of the Immigration Rules that  had
    been in issue in the appeal, the  decision  to  refuse  him  is  not  a
    decision that was not in  accordance  with  the  law/immigration  rules
    unless, at the time of the decision, the appellant met the requirements
    of the Rules applicable to his case.  As  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal held in RM (Kwok on Tong HC 395 para 320) India  [2006]  UKAIT
    00039:

        "To put it another way, an appellant can lose his appeal by failing
        to meet just one requirement of the Rules (whether specified or not
        in the notice of refusal) but he can win only by  meeting  all  the
        requirements of the Immigration Rules (whether specified or not  in
        the notice of refusal)"


11.  In the present case, the letter of 6 June had to be relied upon by  the
    appellant, in order to meet the requirements of the Rules; but  because
    of its date, it could not meet  those  requirements.   Paragraph  245AA
    accordingly had no application, so as to impose upon the respondent the
    duty of seeking further relevant material from the appellant.

12.  Whilst it would be possible for the respondent, in a  particular  case,
    actually to waive one or more  requirements  of  the  Rules,  any  such
    waiver would need to be clearly articulated  by  the  respondent.   The
    fact that a decision letter neglects to articulate every reason why  an
    applicant is not considered to meet the requirements  of  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules cannot be  said  to  constitute  a  waiver  of  every
    requirement except those expressly relied upon in the letter.

13.   In  the  present  case,  there  is  no  issue   regarding   procedural
    unfairness.  Accordingly, I find that, although there was an  error  in
    the determination of the First-tier Tribunal, it is not appropriate for
    me to set aside that determination,  pursuant  to  section  12  of  the
    Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007,  since  the  error  was
    entirely  immaterial.   The  appellant  could  not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules and his appeal against the respondent's decision thus
    fell to be dismissed.

14.   The  appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is,   accordingly,
    dismissed.
