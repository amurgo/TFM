Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr C Mannan, counsel (instructed by Bukhari Chambers
                    Solicitors)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. For the sake of convenience I shall refer  to  the  appellant  as  "the
    secretary of state" and to the respondent as "the claimant."

 2. The secretary of state appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Carlin  who  allowed  the  claimant's  appeal
    against the secretary of state's refusal  to  issue  a  residence  card
    pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006   ("the   2006
    Regulations"). The issue on appeal was  whether  the  marriage  of  the
    claimant to Ms Ewa Jach, a Polish national, was one of convenience [1].



 3. Judge Carlin considered the interviews conducted with the claimant  and
    Ms Jach on 5 December 2014. On behalf of the secretary of state it  was
    contended that there were inconsistencies indicating that the  marriage
    was one of convenience. There were 305 questions in all. The  questions
    which the secretary of state contended  produced  inconsistent  answers
    were highlighted in the transcript. A copy of the whole transcript  was
    produced.

 4. Judge Carlin has set  out  from  [11-27]  his  findings  regarding  the
    asserted inconsistencies. In assessing  the  interviews  generally,  he
    also noted that their relationship had not been a long one in that they
    had met on 26 April 2014. As at the date of the  interviews,  they  had
    only known each other for about seven months. He therefore 'felt'  that
    it  was  likely  in  the  circumstances  that  there  would   be   some
    inconsistencies in the answers they gave. However, the  fact  that  the
    relationship was not  lengthy  did  not  "necessarily  mean"  that  the
    marriage was one of convenience [10].

 5. On 4 August  2015,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Plumptre  granted  the
    secretary of state permission to appeal. It may be  arguable  that  the
    Judge gave insufficient or inadequate reasons for some of the  findings
    such as set out at  paragraph  17  where  he  failed  to  specify  what
    information the appellant provided to  support  the  finding  that  the
    inconsistency in question was not significant.

 6. Whilst some of Judge Carlin's reasons for finding no inconsistencies in
    the marriage interviews are adequate, Judge Plumptre stated that it may
    be arguable that a number are not, and that little or  no  attempt  was
    made in paragraphs 11-28 of the decision to state why adequate  reasons
    for finding the appellant to  be  consistent  or  to  provide  adequate
    reasons as to why the inconsistencies were not significant.

 7. Mr Kandola relied on the grounds seeking permission and  in  particular
    the reliance by secretary  of  state  on  the  decision  in  Budhathoki
    (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341  (IAC)  at  [14].  There  the
    Tribunal stated that:

         "We are not for a moment suggesting that judgments have to set  out
         the entire interstices of the evidence presented or  analyse  every
         nuance between the parties. Far from it. Indeed, we should make  it
         clear that it is generally unnecessary, unhelpful and unhealthy for
         First-tier Tribunal judgments to seek to rehearse every  detail  or
         issue raised in the case. This leads to judgments  becoming  overly
         long and confused. Further, it is not a proportionate  approach  to
         decide in cases. It is, however, necessary for First-tier  Tribunal
         judges to identify and resolve the key conflicts  in  the  evidence
         and explain in clear and brief terms their reasons  for  preferring
         one case to the other so that the parties can understand  why  they
         have won or lost."

 8. In reliance on that authority Mr Kandola submitted that from paragraphs
    11 to 28, the Judge did not give adequate reasons as to why the answers
    given at interview were either not consistent or if they were, why they
    were not significant. It was "material" that  the  Judge  must  provide
    adequate reasons for finding the claimant to be consistent or that  the
    asserted inconsistencies were not significant.

 9. Mr Kandola noted that the Judge in most instances was not of  the  view
    or "did  not  feel"  that  the  inconsistencies  were  significant.  He
    referred by way of example to [17-18] where the Judge  simply  asserted
    that he did not feel that there was any inconsistency in the answers to
    question 180, especially given the information provided by the claimant
    when answering 'the following question'.

10. He submitted that from question 180 and  following  of  the  interview,
    questions were asked about the sponsor's work. The question  asked  was
    where the sponsor would be working "tomorrow". The recorded  answer  by
    the claimant is "yes, she will go there and  take  to  the  site".  The
    sponsor however answered "MacDonald's". The Judge  however  noted  that
    the interviewer asked at question 181 what "site"  the  sponsor  worked
    on. There the claimant answered "...she do KFC MacDonald's  and  Burger
    King and this type of cleaning."

11. Mr Kandola also submitted by way of example that the finding  that  the
    inconsistency in  question  176  was  not  significant  was  simply  an
    assertion without any reasoning. There the parties were asked where the
    sponsor collected her wages  last  week.  The  claimant's  response  is
    recorded as "When she went to job. Ali house definitely don't  go  into
    ask where you were when he  gave  you  money.  I  don't  go  more  into
    exactly. He definitely paid in Ali house. He definitely paid there."

12. The sponsor however stated the Reading Burger House on Sunday.  (During
    his submissions in this respect Mr Nasim referred to question 166 where
    the sponsor referred to "Mr Ali, my boss", the same answer given by the
    claimant to the question as to where the sponsor went "ask"  about  the
    job).

13. Mr Kandola submitted that the Judge mostly dismissed any assertions  as
    to inconsistencies "out of hand without reasons."

14. On behalf of the claimant, Mr Mannon who did not represent the claimant
    before the First-tier  tribunal,  submitted  that  when  examining  the
    secretary of state's contentions relating to the answers given  at  the
    interview, the background to the decision referred to  earlier  by  the
    Judge is important.  The  Judge  noted  that  the  claimant  was  cross
    examined almost entirely on the answers given at  the  interview  which
    were said to be inconsistent. The transcript of the interview had  only
    been delivered late and the claimant had been prejudiced  by  the  late
    delivery.   In   the   circumstances,   he   allowed   the   claimant's
    representative to conduct a re-examination on issues which should  have
    been raised by an examination in chief.

15. Mr Mannon submitted that the secretary of  state  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter identified seven instances of  alleged  inconsistencies.
    Those are set out at page 1 of the reasons for refusal letter.

16. Moreover, the Judge had regard to the contextual background as set  out
    in the evidence  contained  in  the  claimant's  witness  statement  at
    paragraph 4, namely, that he and his sponsor decided to marry and there
    was an initial appointment with the registry office on 21 August  2014.
    The ceremony  did  not  go  ahead  that  day  as  immigration  officers
    interrupted the ceremony and thereafter conducted a three  and  a  half
    hour "surprised interview". Accordingly the ceremony was  cancelled  as
    the interview took so long.

17. It was further asserted (at paragraph 5 of his statement) that  at  the
    end of the interview, the immigration  officers  said  that  they  were
    satisfied that "we  were  a  genuine  couple  and  allowed  us  to  get
    married." However, they had to re-book the marriage for 27 August 2014.



18. The interview on 21 August 2014 was apparently not  recorded.  Nor  did
    the Home Office refer to or rely on that interview. The Judge only  had
    the interview record of 5 December 2014. The interview record had  been
    delivered so late 'and accordingly prejudiced the claimant'.

19. With regard to the findings from [10] onwards, the Judge had heard  the
    evidence of the claimant and his sponsor.

20. He submitted that the answers referred to [11] regarding questions  17-
    19 were properly found by the Judge to be broadly consistent. Both  the
    claimant and the sponsor identified the name of her child. The  sponsor
    could not remember the exact date of her son's birth but gave it as  20
    September 2009. In fact it was 6 September 2009.

21. Mr Mannan also pointed out that it is evident from the  interview  that
    the exact answers were not fully recorded.

22. The answers to questions 42-44 relating to  where  and  with  whom  the
    claimant's mother lives in Pakistan showed  sufficient  knowledge.  The
    inconsistency as to how many family members were involved was a  matter
    of degree. The  sponsor  did  note  that  the  mother  lived  with  the
    children.

23. Moreover, the names of the claimant's other siblings were identified by
    the sponsor in  full.  She  was  also  able  to  identify  the  "eldest
    sibling."

24. Nor was there any inconsistency between their answers  given  regarding
    the contract in respect of the claimant's phones.  The  sponsor  stated
    that one was "a top up", whereas the claimant stated that one was  "pay
    as you go." Both however were able to give the claimant's mobile number
    (question 48).

25. With regard to the reply as to where the sponsor  picks  up  her  wages
    (question  175-176)  Mr   Mannan  submitted  that   the   Home   Office
    representative could have cross examined the  claimant,  but  did  not,
    with regard to the answer that he gave, namely that she  collected  her
    wages in "Ali house." As noted, Ali was her employer.

26. Mr Mannan also submitted  that  the  secretary  of  state  should  have
    amended  the  "grounds"  in  the  refusal  letter   as   only   a   few
    inconsistencies had been referred to, and not the large  amount  relied
    on at the hearing.

27. He accordingly submitted that  having  considered  the  evidence  as  a
    whole, the findings by the Judge were sustainable.

28. In response, Mr Kandola submitted that some  of  the  replies  revealed
    that there was a lack of knowledge as to the  sponsor's  circumstances,
    which is not the  same  thing  as  an  inconsistency.  He  referred  to
    questions 250 to 255 with regard to any loans that  the  claimant  had.
    Whereas his wife stated that he did not have any, he stated that he had
    some loans, taken out a year before, but had not told his wife.

29. At question 168-169 although the sponsor had referred to Mr Ali as  her
    boss, she was unable to give his first name and  said  "this  difficult
    for me."

30. With regard to questions as to whether the claimant  observed  Ramadan,
    he replied "no" but his sponsor  said  "yes  but  he  not  pray."  Both
    however stated that he had not attended a mosque since  she  has  known
    him. With regard to the question when he observed Ramadan,  she  stated
    that she does not remember, but it was June or July in the summer.

31. In that respect, Mr Mannon referred to the claimant's witness statement
    paragraph 10, page 7, where the claimant stated that although  he  does
    not actually keep Ramadan himself, he used to join the  "older  tenants
    who were following Ramadan" for meals in the evening. That is  why  she
    might have thought that he did observe it. That evidence was before the
    Judge.

32. Mr Kandola also submitted that the answers to questions regarding where
    the claimant studied on coming to the UK, namely the Oxford College  of
    London, revealed that this was not known by the sponsor.  However,  she
    stated that it had something to do with  "accountant  London  somewhere
    college."  He  stated  that  his  course  was  business  management  or
    strategic management. This Mr Kandola submitted constituted a degree of
    vagueness as well.

33. He submitted that the Judge had accordingly failed properly  to  engage
    with the answers given at the interview.

34. In his response, Mr Mannon submitted that after Mr Kandola's concession
    as to the sufficiency of some  of  the  answers,  there  were  only  15
    remaining paragraphs. He pointed out that the claimant's bundle had  21
    documents, amounting  to  122  pages  in  all,  including  the  tenancy
    agreement, proof of  cohabitation,  the  claimant's  wife's  employment
    letter, her wage slips, their joint bank statements as well as proof of
    cohabitation at pages 82-122. There were separate bank accounts showing
    that the claimant and his wife had the same address.

35. he submitted that in coming to his conclusions, the Judge  clearly  had
    in mind both the claimant's and the secretary of  state's  bundles  The
    Judge went to the trouble in allowing the secretary of state to flag up
    additional inconsistencies to  those  relied  on  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal. The Judge was obliged to consider the interview  record  as  a
    whole, which he has appropriately done.

    Assessment

36. The Judge  had  regard  to  the  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Papajorgji (EEA Spouse - Marriage of Convenience)  Greece  [2012]  UKUT
    00038. There is no burden on the  claimant  in  an  application  for  a
    family permit to establish that she was not  party  to  a  marriage  of
    convenience unless the circumstances known to the decision  maker  give
    reasonable ground for suspecting that this was the case. Absent such  a
    basis for suspicion, the application should be granted without more  on
    production of the documents set out in Article  10  of  the  Directive.
    Where  there  is  such   suspicion,   the   matter   requires   further
    investigation and the claimant should be  invited  to  respond  to  the
    basis of suspicion by producing evidential material to dispel it.

37. A marriage of convenience in this context is a marriage contracted  for
    the sole or decisive purpose of gaining admission to the host state.  A
    durable marriage with children and cohabitation is  quite  inconsistent
    with such a definition.

38. The Upper Tribunal in IS (Marriages of Convenience) Serbia [2008] UKAIT
    0031 confirmed that the burden of proving that  a  marriage  is  not  a
    marriage of convenience for the purpose of the 2006  Regulations  rests
    on the appellant. He is not required to discharge it in the absence  of
    evidence of matters supporting a suspicion that the marriage is one  of
    convenience. There is an evidential burden on the  respondent  in  that
    regard.  The  standard  of  proof  which  applies  is  the  balance  of
    probabilities.

39. As is clear from Papajorgji, the question for the Judge will  therefore
    be "in the  light  of  the  totality  of  the  information  before  me,
    including the assessment of the claimant's answers and any  information
    provided, am I satisfied that it is more probable than not that this is
    a marriage of convenience"?

40. The First-tier Tribunal had to  be  satisfied,  having  regard  to  the
    evidence as a whole,  that the  claimant  had  shown  to  the  required
    standard that his marriage was not entered into for the sole reason  of
    securing a right to reside in the UK.

41. In that respect, Judge Carlin  had  regard  to  the  claimant's  bundle
    containing the documentation relied on in support of  the  evidence  of
    their cohabitation. He also considered  their  witness  statements  and
    their oral evidence in support of the claim.

42. In that respect, the claimant stated that he met his wife at the end of
    April 2014. The relationship took off from there. She moved in with him
    in May 2014 at their address in  High  Wycombe  where  they  have  been
    living together ever since.

43. They decided to marry and the initial  appointment  with  the  registry
    was, as already noted, on 21 August 2014.  However,  it  could  not  go
    ahead as immigration officers interrupted the ceremony and  interviewed
    them for a lengthy period. The claimant and the sponsor  asserted  that
    the officers were satisfied on that occasion that they were  a  genuine
    couple and "allowed us to get married." They however had to re-book the
    marriage for 27 August 2014.

44. The interview that took place on  21  August  2014  was  not  produced.
    However, the assertion by the claimant and  his  sponsor  that  such  a
    lengthy interview was conducted that day has not been disputed. Nor was
    their assertion disputed as to the existence of a written transcript of
    that interview.

45. In their witness statements, the claimant  and  his  sponsor  confirmed
    that there were some differences in their replies  but  contended  that
    these  are  normal  in  any  couple's  marriage.  He  had  been  in   a
    relationship for about seven months and some  details  and  information
    about each other may still not have been fully known.

46. He explained the reference to his wife's loan in Poland  where  she  is
    required to pay a monthly maintenance  towards  her  child's  expenses.
    However, this is not a loan. As far as his own loan is concerned he  is
    repaying it on a monthly basis after having taken out an overdraft.

47. He has also dealt with the questions raised concerning Ramadan.

48. The evidence by way of documentation corroborating  the  assertions  of
    cohabitation was produced from pages 24-122 of the  claimant's  bundle.
    This contained documentation such as individual bank statements as well
    as joint account bank statements sent to the same address. In addition,
    there are letters produced by his sponsor from her  employer,  her  pay
    slips as well as tax reference and NI number all of which are  sent  to
    the same address. The joint tenancy, which commenced on  11  May  2014,
    was also produced.

49. Knowledge about each other's day to day activity, including  what  each
    had for breakfast on a particular day, was found by the Judge not to be
    significant. Nor did he find  the  answers  given  in  respect  of  the
    religion to constitute an important issue.

50. I accept Mr Kandola's contention that the Judge might have  given  more
    detailed reasons for the  conclusions  reached.  However,  I  have  had
    regard to the interview records sheet. It  is  now  accepted  that  the
    answers to questions 17-19 were broadly consistent.

51. As to the persons living with the claimant's mother  in  Pakistan,  the
    sponsor was aware that  she  lived  with  "kids".  She  identified  two
    brothers and two sisters. More significantly, she gave the name of  his
    siblings in reply to question 46. The use  of  the  word  "top  up"  as
    opposed to "pay  as  you  go"  did  not  appear  to  be  a  significant
    discrepancy.

52. At question 104, they were asked with whom the sponsor had been  living
    before moving in with the claimant. He identified her friend,  Anieska,
    whom his sponsor also identified and  included  a  person,  Nedim,  the
    latter's boyfriend. It is evident that  those  responses  were  broadly
    consistent as found by the Judge.

53. The fact that the claimant did not know the first name of Mr  Ali,  the
    sponsor's boss, which he  claimed  was  "difficult  for  her"  did  not
    constitute a significant inconsistency or the evidence  of  a  lack  of
    knowledge which she would be bound to know.

54. Nor did the Judge find the answer by the claimant that his wife went to
    collect wages in the past week from Ali's house as opposed to from  the
    Reading Burger King on  Sunday,  to  be  significant.  Given  that  the
    parties had identified Mr Ali as an employer, the exact  place  of  the
    payment of wages a week before was not deemed to be  significant  [16].
    The Judge stated that many married couples  will  not  know  or  recall
    detail of this nature.

55. During the interview the claimant has stated that his family still send
    him money. Both stated that such money had been sent recently (question
    234-235). The amount of �1,000 was identified by each of  them  as  the
    amount sent. Both said this related to expenses - "he must  pay  rent."
    The amount of rent was �400 a month  and  this  consistent  answer  was
    given by both. The identity of the claimant's brother, Ahmed, was given
    by the sponsor as well.

56. When they were asked when  and  where  they  spent  their  first  night
    together, both stated that it  was  on  11  May.  Both  gave  the  same
    address. Both stated that they had breakfast together. He  stated  that
    he had cornflakes and  that  his  wife  had  cornflakes.  However,  she
    referred to having eaten boiled eggs. As noted by the  Judge  at  [24],
    what their partner had for breakfast  on  a  particular  day  some  six
    months prior to the interview  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  be
    remembered.

57. With regard to [25-27] of the determination, although the  Judge  might
    have  more  fully  set  out  the  basis  for  finding  no   significant
    inconsistency, it appears from an assessment of their answers that they
    were being expected to know what they did for the rest of the day  some
    six months ago. Both said that they went to town. He stated  that  they
    went to different branches and not the main shops. She stated that they
    went to town "to eating". Both  stated  that  food  was  obtained  from
    MacDonald's. Again,  the  Judge  was  justified  in  finding  that  any
    inconsistency (if indeed there was) was not significant.

58. Finally, when asked about the last gift the claimant purchased for  the
    sponsor, he said he gave her an iPhone before  they  got  married.  She
    said he gave her flowers  on  Thursday.  The  Judge  was  justified  in
    finding that the sponsor did not reveal a significant inconsistency. It
    was certainly not contradictory. She regarded the purchase  of  flowers
    for her recently as a gift, whereas he understood the question to refer
    to something more substantial, namely a phone which  he  purchased  for
    her prior to marriage.

59. Nor was there any significant inconsistency with regard to the  answers
    given to question 305 where the claimant stated that he did not see his
    wife send her son a gift on his birthday, whereas  she  said  she  sent
    money to her mother, telling her to buy him Lego.

60. I have also had regard to the Judge's comments at [28]. There  he  said
    that he has indicated that an inconsistency is not significant where he
    does not indicate that the marriage is one of  convenience.  He  stated
    that after considering the interviews overall, he was of the view  that
    the secretary of state had ignored answers  that  were  consistent.  He
    noted that the apparent inconsistencies were the only reason why it was
    asserted by the secretary  of  state  that  the  marriage  was  one  of
    convenience. Accordingly, the secretary of state had not satisfied  the
    evidential burden.

61. He went on to find that in any event the claimant  had  showed  on  the
    balance of probabilities that the marriage was not one of  convenience,
    having regard to the "weight  of  documentation"  indicating  that  the
    relationship between them was genuine and subsisting. It  took  account
    of all the documentation to which I have referred, all of  which  tends
    to show that the marriage is not one of convenience [29].

62. The Judge found that there had been continuous cohabitation both before
    and after the marriage which has endured. They had continued cohabiting
    as husband and wife.

63. In the circumstances, there was a proper basis, having  regard  to  the
    evidence as a whole, for the finding that the secretary  of  state  had
    not shown to the  required  standard  that  the  marriage  was  one  of
    convenience.

64. In any event, even if the burden had switched to the claimant  to  show
    that the marriage was on  the  balance  of  probabilities  not  one  of
    convenience, the Judge  had  regard  to  the  weight  of  evidence  and
    documentation which showed that the marriage  was  indeed  not  one  of
    convenience. Those findings were properly available to the Judge.
