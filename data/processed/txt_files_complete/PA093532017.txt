Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Fripp of Counsel, instructed by Lawrence & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS
    Introduction


 1. The Appellant is 23 years old (date of birth 15 October 1997). He is  a
    national of Afghanistan and his home area is the Laghman province.


 2. This is the remaking of the decision in the Appellant's protection  and
    human rights appeal. In a decision promulgated  on  15  November  2018,
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Monson  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against  the  decision  of  Judge  Sammi  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    promulgated on 21 December 2017 ("FTT"). Judge Monson  found  that  the
    FTT had erred in law but retained the findings of fact insofar as  they
    relate to the Appellant facing a real  risk  of  persecution  from  the
    Taliban in his home area (see paragraphs 12-17 of the decision  of  the
    FTT and paragraph 16 of the decision of  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Monson). On remaking the decision, Judge Monson dismissed  the  appeal,
    finding that the Appellant could relocate  to  Kabul.  The  Appellant's
    appeal to the Court of Appeal was  allowed  by  consent  and  the  case
    remitted to the Upper Tribunal.  The Court of Appeal's order set  aside
    the decision of the deputy judge in its entirety, including the earlier
    finding that the FTT's decision involved the making of an error of law.

 3. At a Case Management Review Hearing on 27 November 2020, Upper Tribunal
    Judge Stephen Smith heard submissions on whether it  was  necessary  to
    redetermine whether the decision of the FTT involved the making  of  an
    error of law and, if so, whether it should be set aside.  As set out in
    the note of that hearing at the Annex to this decision, it  was  common
    ground that the decision of the FTT involved the making of an error  of
    law such that it needed to be set aside, with certain findings of  fact
    preserved.  Judge Stephen Smith set the  FTT's  decision  aside,  while
    retaining the FTT's findings of fact in relation to persecution in  the
    Appellant's home area. It not being in issue that the  Appellant  would
    face a real risk of serious harm, as defined in Article  15(c)  of  the
    Qualification Directive, in his home province  of  Laghman,  the  Upper
    Tribunal identified the remaining issues for consideration on  remaking
    as relating to relocation to Kabul.


 4. It is the Appellant's case that he faces a real risk of persecution  or
    serious harm in Kabul and that it would  be  unreasonable  for  him  to
    relocate to Kabul.

 5. In relation to the first limb, in summary the Appellant's case is  that
    the risk flows from the preserved findings of fact reached by  the  FTT
    concerning his and his father's past association with the Taliban.  His
    father,  who  was  in  the  Taliban,  disappeared  in   2011.   Shortly
    thereafter, the Taliban kidnapped the Appellant from his home.  He  was
    taken to the mountains, where he was detained against his will  in  the
    madrasa. He escaped when the madrasa was raided by the police  and  the
    Americans. The Appellant submits that on relocation to Kabul:


    1) he faces a real risk of being detained  by  the  Afghan  authorities
       because of his past history and that, whilst in detention, he  would
       face a real risk of torture; and/or
    2) there is a real risk that he will  be  identified  by  the  Taliban,
       given  the   social   structures   in   Kabul   and   his   apparent
       Westernisation.


 6. In relation to the second limb, in summary it is the  Appellant's  case
    that his personal circumstances are such that it would be  unreasonable
    to expect him to relocate to Kabul:


    1) he is a young man;
    2) he arrived in the UK in May 2013, when he was 15 years old,  and  so
       has lived in this country for approximately 8 years;
    3) he has never been to Kabul and does not know anyone there;
    4) his background needs to be hidden to ensure his  safety  and  so  he
       would have to avoid the those members of the community whose help he
       would otherwise have sought; and
    5) he suffers from mental health problems.


 7. A separate point raised by Mr Fripp on behalf  the  Appellant  is  that
    there is a substantial risk that he will return to  his  home  area  to
    look for his uncle, where he faces an Article 15(c) risk and is at risk
    from Taliban as a result of his past history.


 8. In the refusal decision, dated 12 September 2019, Respondent concluded:


    1) that the Appellant would not be at risk from the Afghan  authorities
       or the Taliban in Kabul; and
    2) it would not be unreasonable to expect the Appellant to relocate  to
       Kabul given -
          i) he is a single adult male, who speaks Pashto  and  is  in  good
             health. He will therefore be able to find lawful employment;
         ii) he mother and maternal uncle are in Afghanistan; and
        iii) he was educated in Afghanistan and has previously been employed
             in his home country, which demonstrates  that  he  can  support
             himself without the assistance of others.


    Hearing


 9. We agreed to treat the  Appellant  as  vulnerable  given  the  evidence
    relating to his mental health. No particular adjustments to the hearing
    were requested, save that he be given time to respond to questions  and
    special care be taken to avoid interrupting him during his evidence. We
    ensured that he understood that he could have a break at any point.  At
    one point, whilst being cross-examined, he became  distressed  but  was
    happy to continue without a break.


10. We heard oral evidence from the Appellant (who gave evidence  with  the
    assistance of a Pashto interpreter), Mr Abdul Nasir (who gave  evidence
    in English) and Mr Mumtaz Oraykhil (who gave evidence in English).

11. In closing, Mr Whitwell  relied  upon  the  refusal  decision  and  the
    skeleton argument drafted by his colleague, Mr Kotas. Mr  Fripp  relied
    upon his skeleton argument. Both advocates made  helpful  supplementary
    oral submissions and we are grateful  to  them  for  their  assistance.
    During the course of this decision, we address the points they made.


    Evidence


12. In reaching our decision we have taken into account the:


    1)  Respondent's  bundle,  which  includes  the   Appellant's   witness
       statements, dated 3 July 2013 ("witness statement 1") and 2 February
       2017 ("witness statement 2");
    2)  Appellant's  updated  bundle  (pages  1-332),  which  includes  the
       Appellant's witness  statement,  dated  21  January  2021  ("witness
       statement 3");
    3) Appellant's bundle containing evidence in  relation  to  his  mental
       health (pages 1-113); and
    4) oral evidence of the Appellant and his witnesses.


13. We did not reach our findings of  fact  until  we  had  considered  the
    entirety of the evidence in the  case,  in  the  round,  to  the  lower
    standard.


    Legal framework

14. The burden of proof in protection claims is on the  Appellant  and  the
    standard of proof is that of a reasonable degree  of  likelihood  or  a
    real risk.

15. Paragraph 339O of the Immigration Rules, reflecting Article  8  of  the
    Qualification Directive, provides that the Secretary of State will  not
    make:

      1) a grant of refugee status if in part of the  country  of  origin  a
         person would not have a well-founded fear of being persecuted,  and
         the person can reasonably be expected to stay in that part  of  the
         country; or
      2) a grant of humanitarian protection if in part  of  the  country  of
         return a person would not face a real  risk  of  suffering  serious
         harm, and the person can reasonably be expected  to  stay  in  that
         part of the country.


16. In assessing whether a person can reasonably be expected  to  relocate,
    the question to be answered is whether it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
    expect an appellant, who faces a real risk of serious harm in one  part
    of his country, to move to a less hostile part. If  the  appellant  can
    live a relatively normal life  there,  judged  by  the  standards  that
    prevail in his country of nationality generally, and if  he  can  reach
    the less hostile part without undue hardship or  undue  difficulty,  it
    will not be unreasonable to expect him to move  there  (Januzi  v  SSHD
    [2006] UKHL 5).


17. Once the Respondent has identified a location for return, it is for the
    Appellant to prove why return to that location would  be  unduly  harsh
    but within that burden, the evaluation exercise should be holistic.

18. In AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2020]  UKUT  00130  (IAC),  the
    Upper Tribunal  gave  guidance  as  to  the  factors  relevant  to  the
    assessment of the reasonableness of relocation to Kabul at �  253(iii)-
    (v). Mr Fripp confirmed that he was not asking us to depart  from  this
    guidance.

    Findings and conclusions


    Risk of persecution/serious harm in Kabul


    From the Afghan authorities


19. The Appellant's case, as set out in the skeleton argument of Mr  Fripp,
    is that the Appellant would be at risk of detention and/or  torture  by
    the Afghan authorities by reason of his  and  his  family's  connection
    with the Taliban.


20. We find that the Appellant would not face a real risk of persecution or
    serious harm from the Afghan authorities on  relocation  to  Kabul.  We
    reach this conclusion for the following reasons.

21. We remind ourselves that pursuant to the FTT's unchallenged findings of
    fact, the Appellant's links with the Taliban are:

      1) the Appellant's  father,  who  disappeared  in  2011,  was  in  the
         Taliban;
      2) the Taliban would visit the Appellant's father at the  family  home
         at night and be served tea;
      3) shortly after the Appellant's father disappeared, at which time the
         Appellant was 13 years old, the Appellant was  kidnapped  from  his
         home by the Taliban and detained at a  madrasa.  He  escaped  after
         three months, when the Afghan authorities and the Americans  raided
         the madrasa.


22. We consider first whether the appellant faces  a  real  risk  of  being
    stopped and detained  for  questioning  by  the  authorities  at  Kabul
    airport in circumstances that would amount to an act of persecution  or
    serious harm.

23. Dr Giustozzi, at paragraph 6 of his report, states that  the  Appellant
    will be unable to get through the airport undetected  because  he  will
    not be in possession of any identification. He  also  states  that  the
    Appellant will be detained if there is a report filed about him in  his
    home district and/or if there is a warrant out in his name  (paragraphs
    5 and 6).

24. There is no evidence that any such report  or  warrant  exists  and  Dr
    Giustozzi does not state that  the  circumstances  of  the  Appellant's
    background are such that it should be inferred that such  a  report  or
    warrant exists.

25. Dr Giustozzi's evidence about the Appellant being stopped and  detained
    at the airport is in conflict with evidence in the report, dated August
    2017, prepared by Asylos. In that report, the director  of  the  Afghan
    Migrants Advice and Support Organisation ("AMASO") in Kabul stated:

         "There is no question upon arrival, the  only  thing  they  say  is
         okay, they check their names okay, you are this person and if  they
         have tazkira ... they might register the name of the tazkira,  that
         is it. There is no  any  immigration  person  in  the  airport  and
         nothing happens ..."


26. In the same report, Dr Anicee Van Engeland stated:


         "Upon arrival at the airport, returnees  are  met  by  the  airport
         police. There is a centre  located  in  the  arrival  lounge  where
         returnees will firstly see a  representative  of  the  Ministry  of
         Refugees  and  Repatriations  office.  They  will  be   registered.
         Returnees  can  then  speak  to  representatives   from   different
         ministries  ...  and  from  the  IOM.  Doctors  are  also  present.
         Returnees are under no obligation to speak to anyone  but  for  the
         Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations ...  Many  returnees  report
         being verbally abused by the police and by custom officers  at  the
         airport: they say they were insulted for leaving  the  country  and
         for becoming a burden now that they were back. The  UNHCR  monitors
         the whole arrival process."


27. We do not need to resolve the conflict because the Appellant's evidence
    was that he gave his Afghan identity document, namely his  Tazkira,  to
    the Home Office and therefore we find that it will be returned  to  him
    prior to him arriving  at  Kabul  airport.  Consequently,  even  on  Dr
    Giustozzi's evidence, the Appellant will not be stopped at the  airport
    by the Afghan authorities.

28. Mr Fripp submitted that,  irrespective  of  whether  the  Appellant  is
    stopped  and  detained  at  the  airport,  there  will  remain  a  risk
    throughout the Appellant's time in Kabul that  his  family  connections
    with the Taliban will become known to the authorities.  Mr  Fripp  gave
    the example of the  Appellant  disclosing  his  identity  when  seeking
    employment or housing. Again, as we find that the Appellant will be  in
    possession of his Tazkira, we conclude there is no reason why he  would
    need to disclose his family history in the circumstances  described  by
    Mr Fripp.


29. However, we consider there is a real risk  that  the  authorities  will
    become aware of his background in some other way, such as the Appellant
    discussing his past with somebody he meets in Kabul. The only  evidence
    of the attitude of the authorities is contained within the report of Dr
    Giustozzi, at paragraphs 6-16.

30. Dr Giustozzi states that, if the police became aware of the Appellant's
    family background (paragraph 6), it is likely  they  would  detain  the
    Appellant for interrogation. At paragraph 12, he states that  there  is
    an assumption that young sons of Taliban fathers will follow  in  their
    father's footsteps and that, typically, a  Taliban  father  would  have
    sent his son to religious seminars, taught by teachers  linked  to  the
    Taliban. Dr Giustozzi states that  this  profile  fits  the  Appellant.
    Further, he quotes, what we assume are the words of the  single  police
    officer that a member of Dr Giustozzi's team  interviewed,  that  "most
    times sons of these  Taliban  commanders  and  fighters  have  valuable
    information about the insurgents groups activities, which can help  the
    security forces  ..."

31. We find that the description of the family  profile  that  has  led  Dr
    Giustozzi to conclude that the police will detain the Appellant, is not
    actually the profile of this Appellant because:

      1) at paragraph 15 of the report, Dr Giustozzi states that, "mostly it
         is relatives of  commanders  and  leaders  who  are  likely  to  be
         detained; cases of relatives of common  fighters  been  detained  a
         rare  ..." Dr Giustozzi does not state that it is his opinion, from
         the evidence he is reviewed, that  the  Appellant's  father  was  a
         Taliban commander or leader. The only evidence we have is from  the
         Appellant and that is limited to the Taliban  visiting  the  family
         home at night and being served tea. In our view,  we  cannot  infer
         from this limited information the Appellant's father was a  Taliban
         leader or commander;
      2) the Appellant's circumstances do not indicate that  the  assumption
         about young sons following in their father's footsteps would  apply
         because the Appellant has not seen his father for 10 years and  has
         not lived in Afghanistan for eight years; and
      3) the reference to Taliban fathers sending their sons for instruction
         by teachers linked to the Taliban does not apply in the Appellant's
         case. He  was  kidnapped  by  the  Taliban  and  the  ordeal  ended
         approximately 10 years ago.

32. Dr Giustozzi states (paragraph 8) that the police officer who spoke  to
    a member of his team stated that, if the police became aware  that  the
    Appellant "was with the Taliban for three months", the Appellant  would
    definitely be detained (paragraph 8). We place little  weight  on  this
    evidence, for the following reasons:


      1) it comes from a single source;
      2) the police officer who provided this information, according to  the
         summary of his career history at paragraph 7, has never  served  in
         Kabul and there is no reference in Dr  Giustozzi's  report  to  the
         officer purporting to have knowledge of police practice in Kabul;
      3) it is wholly unclear from the description of the Appellant as being
         "with the Taliban for three months", whether the police officer was
         informed that the Appellant was 13 years old the time, that he  was
         kidnapped and that it was 10 years ago. We consider  these  factors
         to be relevant, given the statement was made by the officer in  the
         context of his opinion about current investigations by the security
         forces into suspected insurgents.


33. Dr Giustozzi does not specify  whether  he  considers  the  other  risk
    factors he identified apply to this Appellant  but  in  any  event,  we
    conclude that they do not, given  they  relate  to  the  police  taking
    revenge on the relatives of the  Taliban  when  a  close  colleague  is
    killed or detaining close relative the Taliban if, during a  raid,  the
    Taliban members themselves escape. The clear meaning of these events is
    that there is an immediacy and proximity between the attempt to  detain
    the Taliban and the detention of the close family member.


    Risk from the Taliban


34. It is the Appellant's case that the Appellant  faces  a  real  risk  of
    persecution or serious harm at the hands of the Taliban because of  the
    ease with which he will be identified, by reason of:


      1) the extent to which identity in Kabul is determined by  family  and
         local connections and the relative proximity of Laghman  to  Kabul;
         and
      2) the Appellant's apparent Westernisation.


35. The Respondent submitted that AS (Kabul) is a complete answer  to  this
    point.


36. The relevant section of the country guidance is found at �253:


         "A person who is of lower-level interest for the Taliban (i.e.  not
         a senior government or security services official, or a spy) is not
         at real risk of persecution from the Taliban in Kabul."


37. We conclude that we do not need to make a finding  as  to  whether  the
    Appellant will become known to the Taliban  by  reason  of  the  social
    structures in Kabul or his apparent westernisation because we find that
    there is no evidence from which we conclude that the Taliban would have
    any interest in the Appellant over and above any other civilian  living
    in Kabul.

38. We have reviewed the country information within the Appellant's  bundle
    and the report of Dr Giustozzi with care. There is nothing within  that
    evidence addressing  the  risk  of  persecution/serious  harm  of  this
    Appellant by reason of his family history with the Taliban. We note  in
    particular that Dr Giustozzi was given access  to  the  particulars  of
    these Appellant's case and dealt with the  risk  from  the  Taliban  at
    paragraphs 3-5 of his report. His assessment was solely in terms of the
    general risk to civilians by reason of the activities of the Taliban.

39. Insofar as Mr Fripp argued westernisation as a  stand-alone  point,  we
    reject it because the Upper Tribunal in AS (Kabul) concluded:

         "the evidence before us, considered together and as a whole, points
         to returnees facing challenging circumstances not because they have
         returned from the west (risk from westernisation was  categorically
         rejected in the 2018 UT  decision  (at  paragraph.  187)  and  this
         finding was not appealed) ...".


40. We therefore conclude that the Appellant does not face a real  risk  of
    persecution/serious harm on relocation to Kabul and nor does  he  face,
    applying AS (Kabul), a real risk of a serious individual threat to  his
    life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence.

    Risk on return to Laghman Province

41. Mr Fripp submitted that there was a real risk that the Appellant  would
    choose to return to his home area and thereby  place  himself  at  real
    risk of persecution or serious harm at the hands of the Taliban. In our
    view, it is unnecessary for us to  assess  such  risk.  The  protection
    afforded to an individual is confined to the  circumstances  prescribed
    in the Refugee Convention and  the  Qualification  Directive  and  this
    protection does not extend to  circumstances  in  which  an  individual
    chooses to return to a place where he faces a real risk of  persecution
    or serious harm.

    Reasonableness of relocation to Kabul


    Factual findings


42. The following facts are not in dispute:


      1) the Appellant is from the Laghman Province;
      2) his home was in a village;
      3) he lived with his  family,  namely  his  mother,  father  and  four
         younger siblings, until he was 13 years old;
      4) his father disappeared in 2011;
      5) he  was  kidnapped  by  the  Taliban  shortly  after  his  father's
         disappearance. During his three-month detention, he was abused  and
         exploited. On escape, he fled Afghanistan with  the  assistance  of
         his maternal uncle;
      6) he arrived in the UK on 10  March  2013,  having  left  Afghanistan
         approximately 11 months earlier;
      7) he currently suffers from depression and is being treated  with  an
         anti-depressant;
      8) he has a relatively recent history (2017) of chronic anxiety;
      9) he speaks Pashto.


43. We accept the Appellant's account about his life in Afghanistan,  given
    that there was no challenge  to  this  part  of  his  evidence  by  the
    Respondent and because we find it inherently  plausible.  We  therefore
    make the following findings.


44. The Appellant lived in a  village  with  his  family.  The  only  other
    relative with whom the Appellant had contact was  his  maternal  uncle,
    who lived in the same district. His father had some land, upon which he
    grew wheat and vegetables. The Appellant went to school at the  age  of
    six but left after two years because, given his family's limited means,
    he had to help his father work the land. When he was  approximately  11
    years old, he worked as a shop assistant at  a  grocery  shop  and  his
    income was used to support the family. During this period, his siblings
    worked the land with their father.  After  his  father  disappeared  in
    2011, his maternal uncle stepped in to help the family.  He  has  never
    been to Kabul and does not know anybody who lives there.


45. The extent of the Appellant's contact with his family in Afghanistan is
    in dispute. It is the Appellant's case that, after he left Afghanistan,
    his maternal uncle took responsibility for  his  family  and  they  all
    relocated because of their fear of the Taliban. He has given consistent
    accounts  that,  on  arrival  in  the  UK,  he  was  able  to  maintain
    intermittent telephone contact with his uncle.  His  uncle  refused  to
    tell the Appellant where the family were  living,  partly  because  his
    uncle feared that if the Appellant returned, the family would be put at
    risk and partly to assist the  Appellant's  asylum  claim.  In  witness
    statement 2, prepared in February 2017, the Appellant  stated  that  he
    was not presently in contact with his family, with the  last  telephone
    call with his uncle having occurred 4 to 5 months earlier.

46. At the hearing at the FTT in October 2017, the Appellant said he was in
    contact with his uncle. At the remaking hearing at the  Upper  Tribunal
    in November 2018, the Appellant stated that he had last spoken  to  his
    uncle a month before and repeated his account of why  his  uncle  would
    not disclose where the family were living.

47. In his witness statement,  prepared  in  January  2021,  the  Appellant
    stated that he had lost contact with his uncle and that they  had  last
    spoken about a year before. He had tried the telephone number but it no
    longer connected and his uncle had not telephoned  him.  He  maintained
    this account in cross-examination.

48. The Respondent submits that it is implausible that the Appellant  would
    have lost contact with his uncle, given the importance of  that  family
    connection and further, that the timing  of  the  claim  to  have  lost
    contact gives rise to the inference that it is a lie in order to assist
    the Appellant's asylum appeal.

49. Whilst the point made by the Respondent is a valid one, we find,  apply
    the lower standard of proof, that we accept the Appellant is no  longer
    in contact with his family. We reach this conclusion for the  following
    reasons:


      1)  on  previous  occasions  during  the  course   of   these   asylum
         proceedings, the Appellant  has  been  prepared  to  give  evidence
         contrary to his case. At the FTT hearing and at the first  remaking
         hearing at the Upper Tribunal, the Appellant disclosed that one  of
         the reasons that his uncle did not want to  disclose  the  family's
         location was in order to assist the Appellant's asylum claim;
      2) the relevance of the nature and extent of the  Appellant's  contact
         with his family in Afghanistan has always been  a  relevant  issue.
         Consequently, if he was going to lie about this contact in order to
         improve the prospects of success of his  asylum  appeal,  he  could
         have lied at a much earlier stage; and
      3) it has never been in dispute that all of  the  Appellant's  family,
         including his uncle, lived in the Laghman province nor  that  there
         was, and is, an Article 15C risk in this province. Given that there
         is no evidence from which  we  can  conclude,  applying  the  lower
         standard of proof, that when they fled  their  home  district,  the
         family fled the province, we consider it plausible that contact has
         been broken.

50. Even if, contrary to our findings, the Appellant were able to establish
    some form of communication with his family, we find that they would  be
    unable to provide  him  with  any  financial  support.  We  reach  this
    conclusion for the following reasons:


      1) we have accepted  the  Appellant's  evidence  about  the  financial
         circumstances of the Appellant's family, namely that they  were  of
         very limited means;
      2) we have reviewed the evidence given by  the  Appellant  during  the
         course of the asylum proceedings and can see no  reference  to  the
         Appellant being questioned about the financial means of his uncle;
      3) in our view, it  cannot  be  inferred,  from  the  fact  his  uncle
         financed the Appellant's safe passage to the UK, that his uncle  is
         a man of means. The  ability  to  fund  such  a  trip  is  just  as
         consistent with his uncle using limited savings in an emergency, as
         it is with his uncle being financially comfortable.


51. We find that the Appellant's friends, who gave evidence  in  his  case,
    cannot afford to send money to the Appellant. We find  their  evidence,
    that they are of limited means and that they send money to  Afghanistan
    to support their own families, to be inherently plausible.


52. We find that the families of  the  Appellant's  friends  would  not  be
    willing to provide the Appellant  with  support,  either  financial  or
    practical. We asked the  witnesses  about  this  and  we  accept  their
    evidence, and that of the  Appellant,  that  given  his  family's  past
    association with the Taliban, they would not want to have  anything  to
    do with the Appellant.

53. As stated above, the fact of the Appellant's mental health  is  not  in
    dispute. We find that the Appellant suffers a long-standing undiagnosed
    physical condition, namely pain in his stomach. We accept his  evidence
    on this point because it is something he is consistently  reported  and
    described as having suffered prior to his arrival in the  UK.  We  also
    accept his evidence that he has suffers from frequent headaches  again,
    because he has consistently reported such a symptom.

54. We find that, on arrival in the UK, the Appellant did not attend school
    or college because the Respondent initially believed he was  an  adult.
    Based on the Appellant's evidence, we find that he currently  lives  on
    his own and works as a shop assistant. We find that  his  physical  and
    mental health conditions have some impact on his day-to-day  life.  For
    example, both conditions affect his sleep and occasionally cause him to
    not be able to work a full day.

55. Whilst we have found that the Appellant does not face a real risk  from
    the Taliban or the Afghan authorities, we find that he  has  a  genuine
    subjective fear, given his life experiences in Afghanistan. We find, as
    a result of this subjective fear, the Appellant will not seek out  help
    from people within the community who might otherwise have been able  to
    help him.


56. As previously stated, we find that his Tazkira will be returned to  him
    by the Respondent prior to him arriving in Kabul.

    Conclusions

57. Applying this factual matrix to the country guidance in AS (Kabul),  we
    conclude that it would be unduly  harsh  to  expect  the  Appellant  to
    relocate to Kabul. We reach this conclusion for the following reasons.


58. The Appellant would arrive in Kabul with no established social  network
    nor any connections that could be fostered in order to develop  such  a
    network. His experience of life in Afghanistan was as a  child,  living
    in a farm setting,  entirely  dependent  upon  his  family.  He  is  no
    experience of life as an adult in a city.  Pursuant  to  the  preserved
    findings of fact  reached  by  the  FTT,  he  experienced  a  traumatic
    detention at the hands of the Taliban,  and  continues  to  face  being
    persecuted by them in Laghman Province; we find that that  foundational
    experience of trauma significantly undermines his ability to  form  the
    relationships and networks he needs to be able to  relocate  to  Kabul.
    Against that background, he will have no contact with his  family,  and
    even if such contact could be  established  they  would  be  unable  to
    support him financially.

59. He would have access  to  the  basic  level  of  support  provided  for
    returnees, in the form of temporary accommodation, which would last two
    weeks. He would be provided with limited funds, which he would need  to
    use to pay for  accommodation  thereafter  and  to  feed  himself.  The
    accommodation would be in a 'tea house'. Whilst this accommodation,  as
    found in AS (Kabul), is adequate for most single male  returnees,  this
    Appellant - with his mental health difficulties and lack  of  knowledge
    of city life - would be vulnerable to  the  exploitation  and  violence
    described at � 75 of AS (Kabul). In  AS  (Kabul),  the  Upper  Tribunal
    found that the funds available to returnees would be capable of lasting
    between four and six weeks, after which the returnee would need to find
    employment. However, the caveat identified, namely that if a person  is
    not astute or lacks knowledge of local prices, applies in the  case  of
    this Appellant. He would therefore need to be able to  find  employment
    more quickly.

60. We conclude that there is no real prospect of the Appellant being  able
    to secure employment, whether in the  short  or  long  term,  including
    manual labour. Though he has his Tazkira, and some  limited  experience
    of working as a shop assistant,  we  find  that  his  fear  of  drawing
    attention to himself, based on his genuine subjective fear of being the
    subject  of  the  adverse  attention  of  both  the  Taliban  and   the
    authorities, combined with his mental health condition,  mean  that  he
    will be fearful of seeking employment and further, that  his  demeanour
    as a result of this fear will not make him an  attractive  prospect  to
    employers.

61. Drawing this analysis together, we find to the lower standard  that  it
    would be unduly harsh for the appellant  to  relocate  to  Kabul.   His
    conditions  outlined  above,  and  the  reasonably  likely   particular
    circumstances of his return combine to prevent the appellant from being
    able  to  lead  a  relatively  normal  life  there  (cf  Januzi).   The
    unchallenged  and  preserved  findings  of  fact  reached  by  the  FTT
    concerning the kidnapping, detention and flight he  experienced  during
    the formative stages of his childhood, when combined  with  his  mental
    health conditions and likely circumstances upon his return, takes  this
    appellant outside the category of those identified at Headnote (iii) of
    AS (Afghanistan).  He does not enjoy the ability internally to relocate
    to Kabul and the appeal must be allowed on asylum grounds.

62. Given our findings and the preserved findings of fact  reached  by  the
    FTT, we further conclude that the Appellant has demonstrated that there
    are  very  significant  obstacles  to  integration  into   Afghanistan.
    Consequently, he meets the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  and
    therefore that his removal would  be  a  disproportionate  interference
    with his private life.

            NOTE AND DIRECTIONS FOLLOWING CASE MANAGEMENT REVIEW



   1. On 12 September 2017, the Secretary of State refused  the  appellant's
      asylum claim.  His appeal against that refusal was dismissed by First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Samimi in a decision promulgated  on  21  December
      2017.  The First-tier Tribunal accepted the core  of  the  appellant's
      asylum claim but found that internal relocation was a  viable  option.
      On 13 August 2018, Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Monson set aside  Judge
      Samimi's  decision,  preserving  the  core  findings  concerning   the
      appellant's persecution narrative, but setting aside her  decision  on
      internal relocation.  On 22 November 2018, the deputy judge remade the
      appeal, dismissing it.  By consent, an appeal against that decision to
      the Court of Appeal was allowed.


   2. This matter came before me for a CMR today, having  been  remitted  by
      the Court of Appeal pursuant to an  order  by  Master  Bancroft-Rimmer
      dated 5 February 2020.  Mr Fripp, counsel, represented the  appellant.
      The respondent was  represented  by  Mr  Kovats,  Senior  Home  Office
      Presenting Officer.

   3. At paragraph 2, the Court of Appeal's order set aside the decision  of
      the Upper Tribunal dated 22 November 2018 in its  entirety,  directing
      that  the  matter  be  remitted  to  this  tribunal   "for   a   fresh
      determination of the Appellant's appeal, after the Upper Tribunal  has
      handed down judgment in AS (Safety of Kabul)  Afghanistan  CG  [[2020]
      UKUT 130 (IAC)]".

   4. The operative terms of the deputy judge's "Notice of Decision" in  the
      22 November 2018 judgment were as follows:


           "The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  contained  [sic]  an
           error of law, and  accordingly the decision is set aside and the
           following decision is substituted:


           The appeal is dismissed."


   5. Given the Court of Appeal order set aside the 22 November decision  in
      its entirety, it follows that its earlier findings, initially set  out
      in the 13 August 2018 decision, including the  preserved  findings  of
      fact favourable to the appellant, were also set aside.


   6. It matters not that the deputy judge's "error of law"  decision  dated
      13 August 2018 was not expressly set aside.  As the  Court  of  Appeal
      noted in Terzaghi v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2019]
      EWCA Civ 2017 per Lord Justice Dingemans at [40]:

           "...if the UT finds an error of law in the decision of  the  FTT
           but then goes on to make its own decision (rather than remit the
           case to the  FTT)  the  'error  of  law  decision'  will  be  an
           intermediate decision only, see paragraph 25 of VOM; and thirdly
           once the final decision has been made by the Upper Tribunal, the
           intermediate decision of the Upper Tribunal will merge with  the
           final decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  generating  a  composite
           decision for the purposes of an appeal..."

      See also VOM (Error of law - when appealable) Nigeria [2016] UKUT  410
      (IAC), endorsed by the Court of Appeal, above.


   7. It follows, therefore, that the 13 August decision "merged"  with  the
      22 November decision, generating a composite decision, the entirety of
      which has now been set aside.  The  task  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  as
      presently constituted is, therefore, to decide whether the decision of
      Judge Samimi involved the making of  an  error  of  law  and,  if  so,
      whether it should be set aside.


   8. It was common ground that, for the reasons given by  Judge  Monson  in
      his 13 August 2018 decision, Judge Samimi's decision did  involve  the
      making of an error of law, and fell to be set aside.  It  was  clearly
      the intention of the parties, and the Court of Appeal, that the deputy
      judge's findings in this regard be preserved, even  if  the  operative
      terms of the Court of Appeal's order had a different  effect.   I  set
      the decision of Judge Samimi aside, preserving the  same  findings  of
      fact as preserved by the deputy judge, and direct that the substantive
      hearing in this matter takes place in the Upper Tribunal to  determine
      the issues identified by the deputy judge at [16] of his error of  law
      decision dated 13 August 2018.  Specifically, I preserve the  findings
      of fact reached by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  issue  of  the
      appellant's past persecution,  and  direct  that  the  sole  remaining
      protection issue for resolution  is  whether  internal  relocation  to
      Kabul would be unduly harsh.  Judge Samimi made no express  Article  8
      findings, meaning that the Article 8  assessment  the  Upper  Tribunal
      will conduct will not need to take as its starting point  any  earlier
      preserved Article 8 findings.

   9. At the CMR hearing, Mr Kovats confirmed that  the  respondent  accepts
      that the appellant faces a real risk of being persecuted on Convention
      grounds in his home area of Laghman Province, as well  as  an  Article
      15(c) risk under the Qualification Directive.

  10. [Directions given for resumed hearing]
