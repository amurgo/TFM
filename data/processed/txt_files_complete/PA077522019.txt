                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Foudy ('the Judge') sent to the parties on 4 December 2019  by
    which the appellant's appeal against a decision of  the  respondent  to
    refuse to grant international protection was dismissed.

 2. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Simpson granted permission  to  appeal
    on all grounds.


Anonymity

 3. The Judge did not issue an anonymity direction. This  is  a  matter  in
    which the appellant has sought asylum and I am mindful of Guidance Note
    2013 No 1 which is concerned with  anonymity  directions  and  confirms
    that the starting point for consideration of such  directions  in  this
    chamber of the Upper Tribunal, as in all courts and tribunals, is  open
    justice. However, I observe paragraph 13 of the Guidance Note where  it
    is confirmed that it is the present practise  of  both  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and this Tribunal that an anonymity direction is made  in  all
    appeals  raising  asylum  or  other  international  protection  claims.
    Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make an anonymity direction in order to avoid the likelihood  of
    serious harm  arising  to  the  appellant  from  the  contents  of  his
    protection claim becoming known to the wider public.

 4. The direction is detailed at the conclusion of this decision.

Background

 5. The appellant is a national of India  and  presently  aged  36.  He  is
    Muslim by religion. He asserts that  he  married  his  former  wife,  a
    Hindu, in 2002. They were from different cultures  and  so  married  in
    secret  without  the  knowledge  of  their  families.  Following  their
    marriage, the couple informed their respective families  as  to  recent
    events. The appellant's parents were angry but accepted  the  marriage.
    His wife's family were unhappy, and her father made  a  report  to  the
    police that led to the appellant being detained for one day.

 6. Upon his release the appellant did not speak to his wife. Four or  five
    days later an aunt of his wife attended the appellant's home and  spoke
    to his family about the marriage.  This  was  an  indication  that  his
    wife's family had relented. The appellant and  his  wife  had  a  Nikah
    ceremony and then subsequently lived together. Their child was born  in
    2004.

 7. The appellant was issued with a six-month tourist visa  to  the  United
    Kingdom on 24 September 2015. He entered this country in  October  2015
    and stayed for one month before returning to India. He  was  granted  a
    two-year visit visa on 26 August 2016 and he travelled to this  country
    in October 2016 returning to India in March 2017. He  details  that  he
    experienced marriage difficulties in April 2017, following  his  return
    from his almost six-month  visit  to  this  country,  with  the  couple
    regularly arguing. In May 2017 the appellant  asserts  that  three  men
    entered the family home,  damaged  property  and  threatened  him.  The
    appellant reported this incident to the police and the following day he
    was called to attend a police station where he was left to sit all  day
    without speaking to anyone. He was subjected to similar treatment  over
    the course of a week. The appellant believes he was being subjected  to
    indirect pressure from his wife's family. He asserts that his wife  has
    a family member who possesses a connection to the government and is the
    son of a former politician who held high profile in  Mumbai.  His  wife
    filed for divorce on 15 May 2017  approximately  two  months  after  he
    returned to India from this country. The appellant further details that
    he left his parents' home in  June  2017  to  get  medication  for  his
    mother. Whilst away from the property he received a call from a  friend
    who informed him that he should not return home as four or five men had
    attended the family home carrying sticks and making threats.

 8. The appellant travelled to the United Kingdom on 5  July  2017.  On  26
    July 2017 he was served by the respondent with an IS96 ENF for  illegal
    entry by verbal deception. He claimed asylum  the  following  day.  The
    respondent refused the  application  for  international  protection  by
    means of a decision dated 2 August 2019. I note that at [48] to [62] of
    her decision the respondent asserted that a sufficiency  of  protection
    existed for the appellant in India. She further  detailed  at  [63]  to
    [77] that when taking his case at  its  highest,  he  could  reasonably
    exercise internal relocation.

Hearing Before the FTT

 9. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at  Manchester  on  8  October
    2019. The appellant was  represented  by  Miss  Khan.  No  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer attended.

10. The Judge observed at [40] of her decision that on the appellant's  own
    evidence the families became reconciled to the marriage and  agreed  to
    the Nikah taking place. The couple resided together for several  years,
    and a child was born to them. The Judge found:

         '... the appellant was accepted into  his  wife's  family  and  the
         marriage lasted for  14  uneventful  years.  I  therefore  find  it
         incredible that the appellant's in-laws held a  significant  enmity
         towards him.'

11. As to the familial connection to an Indian politician, the Judge  found
    at [50] that  the  appellant  was  credible  as  to  there  being  such
    connection but he had failed to advance any  'reliable'  evidence  that
    this politician had taken any particular interest  in  the  family,  or
    more importantly, was willing to exert any influence on their behalf:

         'The appellant has adduced no evidence to show that any person in a
         position of power in India is willing or  even  inclined  to  'pull
         strings' on behalf of the appellant's wife in order to  cause  harm
         to the appellant. Moreover, there is no credible evidence that  the
         appellant's wife or  her  family  wish  harm  to  befall  him.  The
         appellant makes a number of unsubstantiated and, frankly,  fanciful
         allegations that unknown men sought to  threaten  him  and  assumed
         that they had been sent to do  so  by  his  ex-wife.  However,  the
         marriage is over, there appears to be no benefit to  [the  ex-wife]
         in harming the appellant and the appellant has no evidence that she
         or her family members are behind any of the incidents he  complains
         of.'

12. The Judge proceeded to consider internal relocation and sufficiency  of
    protection at [17] of her decision:

         'I find that the appellant has patently failed to establish that he
         has a genuine fear of persecution in India and that it is  a  well-
         founded fear.  I  also  find  that  the  appellant  has  failed  to
         establish that internal relocation  is  not  available  to  him  in
         India, which is a huge country with a vast population, and/or  that
         the  Indian  authorities  cannot  or  will  not  provide   adequate
         protection to him.'

13. I observe that the  Judge  considered  the  issues  of  sufficiency  of
    protection and internal relocation by taking the  appellant's  case  at
    its highest and as an alternative decision to the earlier rejection  of
    the core of the claim.

Grounds of Appeal

14. The appellant relies upon unsigned grounds running to three pages.  The
    essence of the challenge is identified at �2 of the grounds:

         'In the  appellant  bundle,  which  included  a  witness  statement
         covering 63 paragraphs and 7 documentary  evidence,  the  Appellant
         has provided a detailed and chronological account of  his  troubles
         in India. It is submitted however that Judge  Foudy's  findings  in
         paragraphs 14 to 16 of the determination are brief and  touched  on
         limited aspects of the  appellant's  account.  Consequently,  Judge
         should have  made  a  more  in-depth  finding  of  the  appellant's
         credibility during the appeal hearing.'

15. The appellant further asserts that the Judge failed  to  give  adequate
    reasons when reaching her decision.

16. In granting permission to appeal by a decision  dated  8  January  2020
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Simpson reasoned, at [2]:

         'Permission to appeal is granted because as asserted  the  Decision
         arguably disclosed:


             i.   illustrated by the brevity of reasoning (14-16),  failure
                to  provide  an  overall  adequacy  of  consideration   and
                reasoning concerning the totality of evidence  relied  upon
                by the appellant in his asylum appeal, and/or reasoning  as
                to those parts of the appellant's evidence weight was given
                and those parts weight not given; and


             ii.  failure to make findings on material matters viz. claimed
                persons of influence in the  appellant's  ex-wife's  family
                and/or  misconceive  the   appellant's   story   viz.   the
                appellant's ex-wife's family  and  police  harassment  (15,
                16).'

17. The respondent filed a rule 24 response observing that the  grounds  of
    appeal amount to nothing more than a disagreement with the findings  of
    the Judge. The respondent observed that it is trite law that a decision
    will not have to cover each and  every  point  made  by  the  appellant
    during the course of the hearing, relying upon [3] of the  headnote  to
    Durueke (PTA: AZ applied, proper approach) [2019] UKUT 00117 (IAC).

Decision on Error of Law

18. At the outset of the hearing I asked Miss Khan and Mr McVeety  to  help
    me identify whether the  grounds  of  appeal  expressly  challenge  the
    Judge's alternative findings at [17] that there was  a  sufficiency  of
    protection  and  the  availability  of  internal  relocation  for   the
    appellant in India.

19. In her usual eloquent and helpful manner Miss Khan  addressed  me  upon
    the grounds of appeal. She accepted that there was no express reference
    to [17] of the decision within  the  grounds,  in  circumstances  where
    there were express challenges to [9], [14], [15] and [16]. However, she
    submitted that the Tribunal could find that the alternative decision at
    [17] was addressed within certain paragraphs of the grounds.  She  took
    me first to �5 of the grounds, which details:

         'An example of the lack of reasons is found in paragraph 15 of  the
         determination, in which Judge Foudy had  among  others,  criticised
         the appellant as having failed to adduce evidence to show that  her
         (sic) ex-wife's family wish harm to  befall  him.  In  making  this
         conclusion, Judge Foudy appeared to have overlooked two  pieces  of
         evidence, marked as Exhibit HA06 and HA07, which had been  included
         in the appellant bundle. These documents dated 25 May 2017  and  21
         June 2017 relate to written complaints made by  the  appellant  and
         recorded by the Indian police in the appellant's own name. They are
         therefore contemporaneous evidence of the appellant's allegation of
         being harassed and threatened by his ex-wife  and  members  of  her
         family. Apart from a blanket dismissal of any  evidence,  no  other
         findings were made in relation to these documents nor  any  reasons
         provided as to whether any weight have (sic) been attached to  them
         or otherwise.'

20. Ms. Khan noted the appellant's contention  that  he  had  made  written
    complaints recorded by the police that were not been  acted  upon.  She
    contended that this was implicitly a challenge to the  finding  that  a
    sufficiency of protection existed. However, I find that �5 is expressly
    constructed as a reasons challenge to [15] of the decision and  not  to
    the alternative finding which is founded upon the  Judge  having  taken
    the appellant's case at its highest.  I conclude that �5 of the grounds
    does not aid the appellant  in  my  consideration  of  this  particular
    issue.

21. Miss Khan drew my attention to �7 of the grounds, and in particular  to
    the concluding five lines:

         '... This is clearly not the case because as per  paragraph  36  of
         the appellant's witness statement, he was made to attend the police
         station for no apparent reason and sit for long hours on  end,  not
         just on occasion, but every day for a  whole  week.  It  was  under
         these circumstances that he  had  believed  that  the  police  were
         colluding with the family of his ex-wife to mentally  pressure  and
         quietly intimidate him.'

22. Miss Khan submits that this is an  express  challenge  to  the  Judge's
    conclusions as to sufficiency of protection. However, when reading this
    paragraph of the grounds in its entirety there is an express  challenge
    to the reasoning in [9] and [16] of  the  decision,  but  there  is  no
    reference to [17]. Upon a fair and consistent reading of this paragraph
    of the grounds, it can  only  reasonably  be  read  as  constituting  a
    reasons challenge to the Judge in respect of her consideration  of  the
    appellant's attendance at the police station. I am unable  to  conclude
    that this paragraph can be read as being either an express  or  implied
    challenge to the alternative finding  at  [17]  as  to  sufficiency  of
    protection.

23. Miss Khan further relies upon �8 of the grounds:

         'It is further submitted that Judge Foudy has not engaged with  the
         appellant's account in its detail and as a whole  and  has  ignored
         vital facts of the appellant's case. Judge Foudy  appears  to  have
         overlooked the appellant's  account  of  fearing  threats  of  'gau
         rakshak' or mob lynching  by  his  ex-wife's  Hindu  boyfriend  and
         associates. This is an important aspect of his case as it is linked
         to his ability to internally relocate within India, which is  again
         a crucial issue that the judge  should  have  given  more  in-depth
         reasons on.'

24. Miss Khan observes that internal relocation is expressly  addressed  in
    this ground and  therefore  establishes  a  challenge  to  the  Judge's
    decision as to internal relocation. I observe  that  �8  is  a  reasons
    challenge primarily directed to the substantive  consideration  of  the
    asylum claim. However, I am satisfied that it is possible to read  into
    this paragraph an express challenge to the internal relocation  finding
    at [17].

25. Upon considering the grounds of appeal with care, I find that there  is
    no  express  or  implied  challenge  to  the  Judge's  finding  in  the
    alternative at [17] that even if the appellant were subject to  a  real
    risk of persecution or a real risk of a breach of protected  article  3
    human rights from members of his former  wife's  family  in  Mumbai,  a
    sufficiency of protection exists: Horvath v. Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2001] 1 AC 489. As there has been no challenge to this
    alternative decision, I note the  recently  reported  decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal in OK (PTA; alternative findings)  Ukraine  [2020]  UKUT
    00044 (IAC) and observe that permission should not have been granted on
    the grounds as pleaded if there is, as I find is the position  here,  a
    reason why the appeal would fail. In the circumstances of  this  matter
    there is no express or implicit challenge to the Judge's finding as  to
    a sufficiency of protection existing in India and therefore this appeal
    must fail.

26. Despite having found that this appeal must fail, I proceed to  consider
    the underlying substance of the appeal in the alternative. The  Judge's
    decision is short and terse, but this does not by  itself  establish  a
    material error of law. The appellant is critical of the length  of  the
    decision because in his view he has provided significant detail both by
    way of his witness statement and accompanying documents  and  therefore
    expected a lengthier decision. I observe that the  appellant's  witness
    statement addresses personal history in detail and I am satisfied  that
    consideration of  much  of  the  presented  personal  history  was  not
    essential to the task the Judge  had  to  undertake.  When  considering
    claims of international protection, a judge is required to consider the
    core issues and  to  make  findings  upon  them.  Following  Budhathoki
    (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC) judges need to  resolve
    the key conflicts in evidence and explain  in  clear  and  brief  terms
    their reasons for preferring one case to the other so that parties  can
    understand why they have lost. Reasons need not  be  extensive  if  the
    decision as a whole makes sense, having regard to the material accepted
    by a judge: Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013]  UKUT  85
    (IAC), at [10].

27. I am satisfied that the findings at [15] are  entirely  reasonable  and
    sustainable. Whilst the appellant makes a great  deal  of  his  in-laws
    having a connection to a local politician who prior to  his  death  had
    some influence and notoriety, it cannot be said to be perverse that the
    Judge found that there was no reliable evidence that this man, and  his
    son, took any particular interest in the family or was willing to exert
    any influence on their behalf. The grounds of appeal are  unhelpful  in
    as far as they place reliance at [6] upon the now  deceased  politician
    connected to the appellant's in-laws. Miss Khan accepted before me that
    the key family member was the  son  of  the  deceased  politician.  She
    sought to rely upon evidence relating to the son,  whom  the  appellant
    asserts is also a local politician in Mumbai. However, the  documentary
    evidence  before  this  Tribunal,  and  previously  before  the  Judge,
    primarily details that the son is a local businessman  with  connection
    to religious and charitable entities. There is one reference within the
    documents  to  him  being  a  senior  executive  officer  to  a   state
    government, but this is not identified in the document under a category
    of 'political work' or 'politics' but under the title 'social work' and
    no further detail is given. The Judge was perfectly  entitled  to  find
    that there was simply insufficient evidence to establish that a distant
    relative of the appellant, or his son,  were  in  any  way  willing  or
    capable of exerting influence of such nature as to require officers  at
    a police station to target the appellant consequent to the  breakup  of
    his marriage, or to require state agents to pursue him. What is said to
    be a reasons challenge is  actually  a  perversity  challenge  and  the
    appellant is incapable of coming close to sustaining it.

28. I accept the appellant's contention that the  Judge  erred  in  finding
    that he had only been required to attend the police station for one day
    and to remain there all day with no-one talking to him. His evidence is
    that he had to do so for a week. But the Judge  made  a  clear  finding
    that this was not 'mental torture' as alleged  by  the  appellant.  The
    Judge's finding at [60] is that the police  were  busy  and  had  other
    things to do. The appellant relies solely upon his own  assertion  that
    his in-laws had influence with the police and the  Judge  was  lawfully
    entitled to conclude, to the requisite  standard,  that  the  appellant
    could not meet the burden placed upon him to establish this element  of
    his claim. The appellant is wholly unable to come close to establishing
    an error of law in respect of this issue.

29. With the helpful direction of Miss Khan I read  various  paragraphs  of
    the appellant's witness statement and, on his own  case  taken  at  its
    highest, he simply surmises that  his  in-laws  are  connected  to  the
    people who visited his parents' home to  intimidate  and  threaten  and
    further surmises that his in-laws persuaded the police not to take  his
    complaint seriously. The appellant is unable  to  found  a  meritorious
    perversity challenge to the Judge's lawful  conclusion  that  there  is
    insufficient reliable evidence, even on the lower standard, to  sustain
    the core elements of his case.

30. As for the issue of internal relocation, I have found that a  challenge
    is raised in relation to the Judge's finding  at  [8]  but  I  find  it
    unsustainable upon careful consideration. The appellant's case is  that
    he is unable to reside elsewhere in India because  he  is  at  risk  of
    being targeted by mob lynching consequent to his being  Muslim.  Before
    the Judge he relied upon various objective material that  relate  to  a
    period of recent Indian  history  where  Hindu  vigilante  groups  have
    attacked  Muslims,  and  in  cases  Christians,  in  relation  to   cow
    vigilantism. Such action is sporadically  ongoing,  with  approximately
    60+ such attacks having occurred since 2010. This is a  very  sensitive
    subject in India at the present time, with the Supreme Court  of  India
    ruling in September 2017  that  each  state  should  appoint  a  police
    officer in each district to take strict action against cow vigilantism:
    Poonawalla v. Union of India No. 754 of 2016 (6 September 2017). Having
    read the documents before the Judge such  as  the  Human  Rights  Watch
    Report entitled 'Violent Cow Protection in India' (February 2019) it is
    clearly established that not every  part  of  India  in  which  Muslims
    reside is subjected to such vigilante action. Miss Khan was  unable  to
    direct my attention to significant instances of such vigilantism taking
    place in the larger urban areas of India. I find that the  Judge  could
    lawfully conclude  when  considering  internal  relocation  that  large
    sections of the Muslim population are not  touched  by  such  vigilante
    action. I  am  satisfied  that  no  reasonable  judge  considering  the
    evidence filed in this appeal and  properly  self-directing  themselves
    could find that a Muslim male seeking to avoid his  in-laws  consequent
    to an acrimonious breakup of a marriage, would be  unable  to  relocate
    elsewhere in India because of the  risk  of  mob  lynching.  Therefore,
    whilst the Judge erred in  her  understanding  as  to  the  appellant's
    evidence as to how many occasions he was required to attend the  police
    station, I find that there was no material error in law in the  Judge's
    finding that when the appellant's case was taken at is highest he could
    reasonably internally relocate within India.
