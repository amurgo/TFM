                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr D Ball, instructed by Hersi & Co Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Abdiyo Hagar, date of birth  1.1.30,  is  a  citizen  of
    Somalia.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Davidson promulgated 10.1.14, who dismissed  her  appeal  against
    the  decision  of  the  respondent  dated  23.11.11,  to  refuse  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as the  dependent  parent  of  her  son
    Mohamed Mahamud, a British citizen present and settled in the UK.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 11.12.13.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    19.3.14.

 4. The appeal then came before  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Monson  on
    23.4.14, at which hearing there was no  attendance  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant. Judge Monson dismissed the appeal, finding no error of  law.
    However, it then came to his attention on 19.6.14 that the  appellant's
    solicitors had produced evidence that the notice  of  hearing  had  not
    been served. Judge Monson gave directions that the determination should
    not be promulgated but the appeal relisted before him.

 5. The appeal was then listed  before  Judge  Monson  at  Field  House  on
    23.7.14. It transpired that contrary to his instructions, the dismissal
    decision had been promulgated. Unaware of  the  judge's  directions  of
    19.6.14, the appellant's representatives applied to the Upper  Tribunal
    in June 2014 for permission to appeal to the Court  of  Appeal  on  the
    grounds of procedural unfairness. On 23.7.14  under  Rule  43(1)  Judge
    Monson set aside his previous decision on  the  basis  that  a  party's
    representative was not present at the hearing. He  then  directed  that
    the appeal should be relisted before another Upper Tribunal  Judge  for
    rehearing of the appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 6. Thus the matter came before me on 11.9.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  For the  reasons  set  out  in  my  error  of  law  decision
    promulgated on 29.9.14, I found that there were errors of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that it should  be  set  aside
    and remade. In particular, I found that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    failed to take into account all the  available  evidence  demonstrating
    the sponsor's financial support of the appellant. I also found that the
    judge had miscalculated the relevant income  requirements  and  wrongly
    disregarded Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit.

 7. I reserved the  remaking  of  the  decision  to  myself  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and it was thus listed before me on 30.10.14.



Findings of Fact

 8. The issue of relationship is now beyond dispute by reason of DNA test.

 9. There remain two issues at large: whether the appellant can demonstrate
    that she is financially wholly or mainly dependent on  the  sponsor  as
    claimed, and whether she can be adequately accommodated and  maintained
    in the UK without (further) recourse to public funds.

10. In respect of the first issue, financial support, the sponsor  produced
    further money transfer receipts to those previously submitted and those
    itemised in Mr Ball's skeleton argument. I  also  accept  his  argument
    that post-decision receipts are potentially relevant to  demonstrate  a
    pattern of behaviour that has continued from before the application  to
    beyond the date of decision.

11. In the light of this evidence, Mr Tufan did not  pursue  the  issue  of
    dependency any further and I find that the appellant  has  demonstrated
    on the balance of probabilities that she meets this requirement.

12.  The  issue  causing  the  greater  difficulty  is  that  of   adequate
    maintenance. Mr Ball has produced a calculation of the necessary income
    support figure. It is now higher than the �519.95 contended for at  the
    error of law hearing at �572.39 weekly income.

13. Mr Ball drew my attention to the case  of  Ahmed  (benefits:  proof  of
    receipt,; evidence) [2013] UKUT 0084 (IAC), in which it was  held  that
    CTC and WTC are able to be taken into account as part of the  sponsor's
    income. That produces an income of �691.01 per week,  higher  than  the
    income support level for the whole family plus the  appellant.  In  the
    circumstances, Mr Tufan did not contest and I find as a fact  that  the
    appellant meets this requirement of the Immigration Rules.



Conclusion & Decision:

14. For the  reasons  set  out  herein,  I  find  that  the  appellant  had
    demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that  she  meets  all  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

                    The appeal is allowed on immigration grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.






Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a full fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been allowed.
