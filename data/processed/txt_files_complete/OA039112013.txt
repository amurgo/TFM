                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. In this document I will refer to the parties  using  the  descriptions
      adopted before the First Tier Tribunal.

   2. The appellant is a male citizen  of  Haiti  born  28  June  1986.   He
      applied for entry clearance to settle in the  United  Kingdom  as  the
      spouse of his  sponsor  following  their  marriage  in  the  Dominican
      Republic on 5 February 2010.
   3. The respondent  refused  the  application  upon  the  basis  that  the
      applicable Immigration Rules had not been  satisfied.   That  decision
      was made on 13 May 2012.

   4. The appellant appealed against  that  decision  and  his  appeal  came
      before Judge of the First Tier Tribunal Britton on 12  February  2014.
      Both parties were represented.  During the course of that  hearing  it
      was noted that sponsor/wife is in receipt of Income Support, but  that
      she receives financial help (as does  the  appellant)  from  a  third-
      party, Mrs Amaran Sadiq and her husband Mr Maqbool Sadiq.  Based  upon
      this third-party support Judge Britton decided to allow the appeal.

   5. The respondent sought leave to appeal.  The grounds contended an error
      on the part of the judge in not explaining his conclusions and whether
      the appeal was  allowed  under  the  rules  or  under  ECHR.   It  was
      contended that the third-party support that was available had not been
      adequately evidenced and that any conclusions  reached  by  the  judge
      were inadequately explained.

   6. The application was then considered by a Judge of the  Upper  Tribunal
      sitting in the  First  Tier  who  granted  leave  gave  the  following
      reasons:

         "1.  The respondent seeks permission to appeal, in time, against  a
      decision of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Britton)  who,  in  a
      determination promulgated on 27 February 2014 allowed the  appellant's
      appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision  to  refuse  him
      leave to enter as a spouse.

     2.  The grounds assert that the judge erred in that he makes  no  clear
      finding under the Immigration Rules and thus the basis  in  which  the
      appeal is allowed and that the third-party support,  accepted  by  the
      judge had not been adequately evidenced.  If  the  judge  allowed  the
      appeal on Article 8 grounds the judge has failed to give  reasons  for
      justifying considering Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

     3.  This was an appeal that fell to be determined under  paragraph  281
      of the Immigration Rules.  Gulshan (Article 8 - new  Rules  -  correct
      approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) has no application.

     4.  However, the determination is barely reasoned and it is  not  clear
      on what basis  the  judge  concluded  that  third  party  support  was
      acceptable or on what basis he has allowed the appeal.

     5.  The grounds are arguable".

   7. Hence the matter comes before me in the Upper Tribunal.

   8. Mr Mills in his submission said the determination was non- specific as
      to whether the appeal had been allowed under Rule 281 or under Article
      8 ECHR, or indeed both.  The respondent now challenged both.   It  was
      accepted that because of the date of the decision the case of  Gulshan
      was not relevant.  There had been a complete lack of reasoning  within
      the determination.  As to reference to the Immigration Rules, Mr Mills
      explained the history of third-party support and the  fact  that  such
      support could now be taken into account, but it had  to  be  borne  in
      mind that such support was not enforceable, such support needed to  be
      proven to be assured. In doing so the burden of  proof  was  upon  the
      appellant.  In this case the  judge  had  not  made  any  findings  on
      whether or not the support could be assured and if so, why.  Mr  Mills
      questioned how the judge could be satisfied as to the adequacy of  the
      support from Mr and Mrs Sadiq.  There was  not  enough  money  in  the
      bank.  There was an income of �110 a week, but no  details  have  been
      given with regard to Mr and Mrs Sadiq's other commitments.

   9. With regard to Article 8, this is mentioned in what is  likely  to  be
      paragraph 17 (un-numbered) and it is not clear at all as  to  how  the
      judge reached his conclusions.

  10. Mr Joseph in reply referred to paragraph 10 of the determination where
      regular payments of �40 to �90 have been mentioned.  He referred to  a
      previous visit visa appeal in respect of the appellant, wherein it was
      accepted that  the  Sadiq's  sent  money  as  they  said.   Mr  Joseph
      submitted that the findings were open to the judge  and  there  was  a
      letter  from  Albany  Fish  Bar  offering  the  appellant  work.   The
      determination was sufficiently reasoned and in respect of Article 8 it
      was very brief, but again sufficient.

  11. At this stage, I indicated that for the reasons  now  given  herein  I
      considered there was an error of law within the determination.  It was
      material and the decision must be set aside.  I indicated that my view
      was that because there had been very little  findings  that  could  be
      preserved and evidence will need  to  be  taken  with  regard  to  the
      financial  aspects  with  regard  to  third-party  support,   it   was
      appropriate for the  matter  to  be  remitted  for  re-hearing.   Both
      representatives were in agreement.

  12. In reaching a conclusion that the determination had to be set aside, I
      noted in particular that the judge had  not  made  clear  findings  by
      reference either to the rules or to Article 8.  Indeed it is not  even
      clear upon which basis the appeal was allowed.  The judge  noted  that
      payments by way of support had been made to the  appellant/sponsor  in
      the past, but because of the nature of the balances held in  the  bank
      account of Mr and Mrs Sadiq, it would be necessary to look also at the
      income position.  Whilst Mr Sadiq's income was  noted,  there  was  no
      reference to his outgoing's and therefore  no  clear  picture  of  his
      ability to meet the shortfall could be understood from  a  reading  of
      the determination.  Such an explanation would be needed to explain  to
      the respondent as the losing party why the  decision  was  made.   The
      conclusions reached by the judge have been inadequately explained  and
      this would amount to an error of law material to the outcome.

  13. The grounds  seeking  leave,  together  with  the  reasons  given  for
      granting permission to appeal also are acceptable  and  explained  why
      the decision cannot stand.

  14. I am satisfied that this case  meets  the  criteria  set  out  in  the
      relevant practice statement for appeals and that it is appropriate  to
      remit the case to the First Tier Tribunal.

  15. Decision of the respondent's appeal  allowed.   The  decision  of  the
      First Tier Judge is set aside and the case remitted for re-hearing.
