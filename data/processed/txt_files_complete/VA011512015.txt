Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Whitwell (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Singh (Sponsor)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer but I will  refer  to
    the original appellant, a citizen of India born on 10  March  1972,  as
    the appellant herein.  She appeals the refusal of an entry clearance to
    come to the United Kingdom as a  visitor.   She  wishes  to  visit  her
    daughter.  In these proceedings the appellant has been  represented  by
    the appellant's son-in-law Balvinder Singh, the sponsor.

2.   The appellant's application  for  entry  clearance  was  refused  on  4
    February 2015.  In deciding to refuse the  application  the  respondent
    recognised  that  the  sponsor  was  in  a  position  to  maintain  and
    accommodate the appellant during her visit but noted that the appellant
    had been refused an entry  clearance  in  January  2015  when  she  had
    applied to visit her daughter for two months and not  three  months  as
    she had done on this occasion.  The Entry Clearance Officer noted  that
    there had been two previous visits and the refusal continues

         "On the first occasion, you stated on your application  form  that
         you would stay in the United Kingdom for one month but you remained
         there for five months and five days.  In  your  second  application
         you stated that you would stay  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  four
         months but you stayed there for five months and  twenty  days.   It
         was noted that, although you left the UK before your visa  expired,
         you had not provided  any  explanation  as  to  how  you  met  your
         personal commitments back in India while you were away for  such  a
         long time.  On your current application you have  stated  that  you
         stayed in the UK to care for your daughter whilst pregnant, but you
         have not satisfactorily explained why you underestimated the length
         of time you would stay by such a margin.


         You do not work and are  supported  by  your  husband.   You  have
         indicated that you receive a monthly income of �170.   This  stated
         income is not reflected  in  the  Punjab  National  Bank  statement
         account number xxx4925 you have submitted.


         Given the above I am not  satisfied  that  you  have  presented  a
         complete  and  accurate  picture  of  your  personal  and  economic
         circumstances in India.  I am therefore not satisfied that you plan
         to leave the United Kingdom at the end of your visit  or  that  you
         are genuinely seeking entry as a visitor for a period not exceeding
         six months (paragraph 41(i) and (ii))."

3.   The application was accordingly refused.

4.   The appellant appealed and her appeal came before  a  First-tier  Judge
    on 5 April 2016.  The judge reminded himself that the rights of  appeal
    were limited to race discrimination and human rights grounds only.  The
    judge heard oral evidence from the sponsor who told the judge that  the
    appellant had remained in the UK beyond her proposed timescale  on  two
    previous occasions as the sponsor's wife required assistance  following
    the birth of their children on each respective occasion.   The  sponsor
    could not travel to India because of the school calendar and  his  work
    commitments.  The bank statements for the appellant's husband  did  not
    reflect his actual income as he was paid in cash.

5.   The sponsor said he had last seen the appellant when  she  had  visited
    the UK in 2013 he had not invited his father-in-law or his  own  family
    members to visit.  He planned to invite his  mother  to  visit  the  UK
    where he had resided since 2001.  His wife had lived  in  this  country
    for the previous six years.  The judge records  that  the  sponsor  was
    initially unsure when his wife last visited India but when pressed said
    that the last visit had been in 2012.  The sponsor told the judge  that
    he was certain that the appellant would visit the UK for  three  months
    as his wife no longer has extra childcare needs.

6.   It was submitted on behalf of the Entry Clearance  Officer  that  there
    was no breach of Article 8  and  family  life  could  continue  through
    visits to India.  The sponsor said he could not travel to India at  the
    present time because he had young children and he would like to  invite
    the appellant to visit the  UK.   The  appellant  had  always  returned
    within the timescale of her visa.

7.   The judge concluded his determination as follows:

         "22. The appellant has satisfied the burden upon her.  It  is  more
             likely than not that the appellant's finances  are  sufficient
             for her proposed visit as they have been in the past.   It  is
             reasonable to  expect  that  the  appellant  relied  upon  her
             husband's financial status in previous applications which were
             successful.


         23.  The central issue is the appellant's willingness or ability to
             provide an accurate declaration of the intended  duration  for
             her proposed visit.  Upon the  sponsor's  evidence  unforeseen
             circumstances have caused the appellant to remain  in  the  UK
             beyond the intended duration of her previous visits.


         24.  The sponsor now claims that his family's needs in the UK  have
             stabilised and therefore the appellant's proposed visit  of  3
             months is a reliable declaration.  It is reasonable to  expect
             that lay-persons are unaware of the specific wording  of  Rule
             41 of the Immigration Rules.  The appellant  has  relied  upon
             the generic 6 months visa to guide her  travel  dates  to  and
             from the UK.


         25.  There can be no doubt that the appellant is now aware  of  the
             need  to  honour  the  statements  she  makes  within  a  visa
             application form.  While the appellant  may  be  guilty  of  a
             technical breach of the Immigration Rules there is no reliable
             evidence to demonstrate that she has acted with mal-intent  or
             otherwise seeks to breach  immigration  control.   Should  the
             appellant  be  prevented  from  entering  the  UK  on   future
             occasions  she  will  have  no  opportunity  to  restore   her
             otherwise good immigration history.


         26.  I remind myself that Article 8 ECHR must be considered  within
             the prism of the  Immigration  Rules.   It  is  reasonable  to
             conclude that but for the technical breach as stated above the
             appellant satisfies the Immigration Rules.  It is within  that
             context I consider whether Article 8 ECHR is engaged.


         27.  I consider Article 8 ECHR and the 5 stage test as set  out  in
             Razgar [2004] UKHL 39 ("Razgar").  I remind  myself  that  the
             respondent  is  entitled  to  control  the  entry  of  foreign
             nationals into the territory and she is afforded a  margin  of
             appreciation in the administration of this.   A  fair  balance
             must  be  struck  between  the  competing  interests  of   the
             individual and the needs of wider society.


         28.  There is no reliable evidence of family life for  the  purpose
             of Article 8 ECHR.  The appellant and  sponsor's  family  have
             formed independent lives and maintained contact by  visits  to
             India.  There is no reliable evidence of  family  life  beyond
             normal emotional ties.


         29.  However I also consider Article  8  ECHR  in  the  context  of
             private life.  For the reasons stated above it  is  reasonable
             to conclude that the appellant had  no  intention  of  abusing
             immigration control and she held the  reasonable  belief  that
             departure from the UK within 6 months  of  her  arrival  would
             suffice.


         30.  The respondent seeks to bar the appellant from the UK for  the
             reasons stated above.  It is reasonable to conclude that  this
             will effectively prevent  the  appellant  from  restoring  her
             otherwise good immigration history and also limit  the  travel
             options for the appellant and  her  sponsor's  family  in  the
             future.


         31.  It is reasonable to expect the respondent  to  approach  these
             types  of  applications   by   considering   the   appellant's
             intentions rather than technical adherence to the  Immigration
             Rules  which  are  widely  acknowledged  as   cumbersome   and
             confusing to the lay-person.


         32.  The available evidence demonstrates  that  the  appellant  has
             significant  ties  to  India  which  have   drawn   her   home
             notwithstanding short delays  to  that  return.   These  short
             delays cannot be relied upon to conclude  that  the  appellant
             has failed to demonstrate her status as a genuine visitor  who
             intends to return to India.  As stated the only real issue  is
             the duration of the appellant's proposed visit.


         33.  It is well-established that the respondent is expected to take
             a pragmatic and reasonable approach to the application of  the
             Immigration Rules;  Chikwamba  applied.   The  respondent  has
             failed to do so on this occasion.


         34.  It is reasonable to expect in  these  circumstances  that  the
             respondent would initially notify the 'offending applicant' of
             an innocent technical breach before  effectively  barring  her
             from entering the UK.   For  these  reasons  the  respondent's
             decision is a disproportionate  interference  with  Article  8
             ECHR.


         35.  As stated above there  is  no  longer  any  ambiguity  in  the
             appellant's mind that she must honour the statements  made  in
             her visa applications. Should the appellant breach  the  terms
             of her visa in the future it may be regarded as  a  deliberate
             and  wilful  act.   However  for  the  reasons  stated  it  is
             reasonable to conclude that her actions result  from  innocent
             misunderstanding.  It cannot be right or fair to  exclude  the
             appellant from the UK in these circumstances."


8.   The respondent applied for permission to appeal pointing out  that  the
    rights of appeal were restricted for any applications made  after  June
    2013.  The appellant had applied to visit her daughter and the  sponsor
    and the refusal did not interfere with the appellant's private life and
    Article 8 was not engaged.  The judge had found  there  was  no  family
    life between the appellant and the sponsor and her family.  His finding
    that the decision was a disproportionate interference  with  Article  8
    had no basis in law.  The visitor had established no  private  life  in
    the UK - the purpose of a visit  was  not  to  allow  an  appellant  to
    develop such a private life.  Reference was made to  Abbasi  (Visits  -
    Bereavement - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 00463 (IAC).   In  that  case  the
    Tribunal it was submitted had referred  to  a  number  of  cases  where
    Article 8 was engaged but those concerned the  family/private  life  of
    those already in the  contracting  state.   There  was  no  finding  of
    interference in the private life of those in the contracting  state  in
    the instant case.  It was submitted that in SS (Malaysia) [2004]  UKIAT
    00091 the Tribunal had said that private, as distinct from family life,
    was not a basis upon which an ECHR right of entry could be  based.   In
    paragraph 8 of the grounds it was submitted:

         "The judge has effectively used Article 8  in  order  to  allow  an
         appeal he finds to meet the Immigration Rules, where  no  right  of
         appeal under the Rules exists."


9.   At the hearing before me I explained the procedures to the sponsor  and
    provided him with a copy of the court bundle so  he  could  follow  the
    submissions made by Mr Whitwell.  Mr Whitwell referred to the  case  of
    Abbasi and Adjei (Visit Visas - Article 8)  [2015]  UKUT  00261  (IAC).
    The judge had referred to the Rules being  "cumbersome  and  confusing"
    but the decision  was  not  properly  structured  and  he  referred  to
    paragraph 12 of Abbasi which highlighted the  need  for  a  structured,
    sequential approach in cases of this kind.   The  judge  had  found  in
    paragraph 28 that there was no evidence of family life and there was no
    finding of private life and accordingly there was no interference  with
    any protected right.  There was no implicit finding  of  private  life.
    As Adjei made clear at paragraph 9 the  judge  had  adopted  the  wrong
    approach.

         "The first question to be addressed in an appeal  against  refusal
         to grant entry clearance as  a  visitor  where  only  human  rights
         grounds are available is whether Article 8 of the ECHR  is  engaged
         at all.  If it is not, which will not infrequently be the case, the
         Tribunal has no jurisdiction to embark upon an  assessment  of  the
         decision of the ECO under the Rules and should not do so.  ...."

10.  Article 8 was not a general dispensing power.  The judge  had  recorded
    that the appellant's daughter had last visited India in  2012  although
    initially unsure.  There was no interference with private life in  this
    case.  There was no  issue  of  bereavement  and  it  was  not  a  case
    involving a child.  The determination should be set aside  and  re-made
    and dismissed.

11.  The sponsor stated that the appellant had visited on two  occasions  on
    a six months' visa and had returned before  the  expiry  of  the  visa.
    During the visits his daughter had been born on the first occasion  and
    his son had been born on the second occasion.  On  both  occasions  the
    appellant had assisted his wife and had not overstayed.  She wanted  to
    return to see her children.  He pointed out that his wife had  required
    more assistance as the birth had been by caesarean section.

12.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the judge's decision  if  it  was
    materially flawed in law.

13.  There is no dispute that in  this  case  the  appellant's  rights  were
    restricted.  The appeal could only be allowed on Article 8 grounds.

14.  As was made clear in Adjei the first question is whether Article 8  was
    engaged at all.  The judge had ruled out family life and  had  made  no
    findings in relation to private life.  The Tribunal  in  SS  (Malaysia)
    chaired by the president, Mr Justice Ouseley,  found  in  paragraph  46
    that "private as distinct from family life is not a basis upon which an
    ECHR right of entry can be based.  It is clear  that  the  position  is
    somewhat softened in burial cases - see Abbasi.   In  paragraph  6  the
    Tribunal states as follows:

         "The decision  summarised  above  illustrates  the  versatility  of
         Article 8 ECHR, together with the difficulty  of  drawing  a  clear
         boundary between its private and family life dimensions in  certain
         factual contexts.  While  each  belongs  to  its  discrete  factual
         context,  these  decisions  nonetheless  illustrate  that   matters
         relating to death, burial, mourning and associated rights have been
         held to  fall  within  the  ambit  of  Article  8.   Three  further
         decisions of the ECHTR have a factual matrix closely comparable  to
         that of the present appeals."


15.  I accept the submissions made by Mr Whitwell that the  judge  erred  in
    finding that Article 8 was engaged at all.  Having found there  was  no
    reliable evidence of family life he made no clear findings in  relation
    to private life.  And the reference  in  paragraph  29  to  considering
    Article 8 "in the  context  of  private  life"  does  not  directly  or
    implicitly grapple with the question in a satisfactory  manner.   While
    the position may be more nuanced than it was found to be in 2004 in  SS
    (Malaysia) and while a fact-sensitive approach is required this is  not
    a case, happily, involving mourning or burial.  I found that the  judge
    materially erred in law in allowing the appeal on  Article  8  grounds.
    The determination reads more as  though  the  judge  was  allowing  the
    appeal under the Rules and Article 8 considerations played no real part
    in the decision making process.

16.  I accept the submissions made on behalf  of  the  respondent  that  the
    determination was materially flawed in law.  I set it aside.
17.  I note that what the  judge  describes  as  "a  technical  breach"  was
    perhaps a little more than that.  She had made two previous  visits  to
    the UK and on the first occasion had said she would stay for one  month
    but had remained for over five  months.   On  her  second  visit  while
    saying she would stay in the UK for four months she had stayed for five
    months and twenty days.  The respondent was not merely relying  on  one
    "technical" breach.  It was not the respondent  telling  the  appellant
    how long she should stay for - the appellant had told  the  respondent.
    There is a suggestion in paragraph 34 of the decision of unfairness but
    the appellant was not barred from the UK following her first visit when
    she overstayed.

18.  In the circumstances in re-making the decision I find  that  Article  8
    is not engaged in this case.  It follows that,  applying  Adjei  -  the
    Tribunal has no jurisdiction and the appeal  must  be  dismissed.   The
    judge raises a spectre  in  paragraph  25  of  his  decision  that  the
    appellant might be prevented from entering the UK on  future  occasions
    not having the opportunity to restore her  otherwise  good  immigration
    history.

19.  The outcome of this appeal does not prevent the appellant  from  making
    an application for an entry clearance  in  the  future.   Nor  does  it
    prevent her relying on the favourable findings made  by  the  judge  in
    this case about her intentions and the reasons she gave for overstaying
    in the past.  While the Entry Clearance Officer is not bound  by  those
    findings as the headnote in Adjei makes clear there  is  no  reason  to
    suppose that appropriate weight would not be given to them.

20.  For the reasons I have given the appellant's appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity Order

The First-tier Judge made no anonymity order and I make none.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The judge made a fee award in the sum  of  �140  finding  that  "the  appeal
succeeds upon a sensible interpretation  of  the  facts.   The  respondent's
decision in these circumstances was unreasonable."

The appellant is not entitled to a fee award in this case.
