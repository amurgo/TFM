                            THE IMMIGRATION ACTS

|Considered at Field House                 |Decision & Reasons Promulgated   |
|On 23 January 2018                        |On 24 January 2018               |

                                   Before:
                          Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt

                                  Between:
                             Nirojan Balasingham
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                            Decision and Reasons



 1. The Tribunal issued a direction on 7 December 2017 requesting that  the
    parties provide written reasons within 7 days as to why an error of law
    should not be found and the appeal remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
    following Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

 2. No response was received from  either  party  within  7  days  and  the
    Tribunal therefore finds an error of law  such  that  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker should be set aside  and  remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal to be re-made de novo.
