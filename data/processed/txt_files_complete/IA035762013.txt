                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   On 19 February 2014 I granted permission to appeal in this case on  the
    basis that the Article 8 issue had not been considered  by  the  First-
    tier Judge.   In the notice of decision I said that if no objection was
    received to the proposal to remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal
    for hearing on the Article 8 issue at which time the Section  47  point
    could be disposed of, that would be the disposal of the matter.   There
    has been no communication by either side  indicating  any  disagreement
    with that proposal and accordingly I allow the appeal and remit  it  to
    the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with paragraph 17 of  the  Senior
    President's Practice Statement for hearing on the Article 8  issue  and
    the Section 47 point.





Signed                                  Date


Upper Tribunal Judge Allen
