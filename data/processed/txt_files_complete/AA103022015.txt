Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr A Maqsood, instructed by Waterstone Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, JH, date of birth 1.3.80, claims  to  be  a  citizen  of
    Mayanmar. The Secretary of State considers that he is Bangladeshi.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Fowell promulgated 9.3.16, dismissing on all grounds his appeal against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 14.7.15,  to  refuse  his
    asylum, humanitarian protection and human  rights  claims.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 7.3.16.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pooler  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    12.4.16. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Gill granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    10.6.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 25.8.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons summarised below, I found no material error of  law  in
    the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to
    require the decision of Judge Fowell to be set aside.

 6. In granting permission to appeal Judge Gill granted permission  on  one
    ground only: that, for the reasons submitted at �2(f)(i)-(vii),  it  is
    arguable that Judge Fowell may have erred  in  his  assessment  of  the
    expert report.

 7. Judge Gill gave detailed reasons for refusing permission on  the  other
    grounds and there was no application before me to renew those  grounds.



 8. The claimant's factual case is that  in  1992,  aged  12,  he  fled  to
    Bangladesh, where he was detained in a camp for 5 years, and then lived
    on the streets, until a man took pity on him and employed  him  in  his
    ice cream business. He claims that he was arrested in 2013  and  forced
    to admit that he was a Rohingya and threated with deportation  back  to
    Myanmar. His employer secured his release and  organised  an  agent  to
    take him to France. His asylum claim is based on fear that on return to
    Myanmar he would be mistreated because of his ethic/religious  identity
    as a Rohingya Muslim.

 9. The appellant claims that he was born in Myanmar as a Rohingya  Muslim.
    He stated in his screening interview that his primary and only language
    is Bengali. However, in his later asylum interview he claimed  that  he
    spoke only Rohingya until  the  age  of  12,  and  continued  to  speak
    Rohingya as his primary language whilst in the camp, and thus until the
    age of 17.

10. The report in question is  a  linguistic  analysis  relied  on  by  the
    Secretary of State and  referred  to  in  the  refusal  decision.   The
    appellant has produced no expert report of his own.

11. I have carefully considered the grounds  in  relation  to  the  judge's
    treatment of the expert report, together with the oral  submissions  of
    Mr Maqsood. However, I find on a reading of the decision that the judge
    dealt with the report at some length and with some care. The judge  was
    not persuaded, even to the lower standard of proof, that the  appellant
    is from Myanmar.

12. I note that some of the grounds misunderstand and misstate the findings
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, such as  ground  2(f)(v),  suggesting
    that  at  �30  the  judge  made  a  finding  that  the   appellant   is
    Chittagonian. That is not what the judge stated. The judge merely cited
    the expert's view that this was a possibility, but was not an expert in
    that  area.  The  judge  made  no  finding  that   the   appellant   is
    Chittagonian. There is no merit at all in this ground of appeal.

13. Another error is at 2(f)(vii), where it is asserted that at  �10(b)  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal the judge was  wrong  to  state
    that the appellant spoke Bengali as his primary and only language. That
    was not a finding of the  judge  but  a  summary  of  the  reasons  for
    refusal, set out at �10. In any event, contrary to the assertion in the
    grounds, the appellant did clearly answer  question  stating  that  his
    primary (main) language is Bengali and when asked  for  all  the  other
    languages he spoke, he again answered Bengali.  The  assertion  in  the
    refusal decision is correct. There  is  no  merit  whatsoever  in  this
    ground of the appeal and the way  in  which  the  grounds  are  drafted
    suggest that the author has an incomplete grasp or understanding of the
    English language.

14. I note from �14 and �15 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal that
    when no Rohingya interpreter was available, the  appellant  elected  to
    refuse the suggestion of an  adjournment  and  to  continue  by  giving
    evidence in English.

15. I note that even now, the appellant has produced no  expert  report  of
    his own. I also pointed out to Mr Maqsood, that  it  was  open  to  the
    appellant to have sought further and better particulars of the  report,
    addressing some of the concerns raised by Mr Maqsood. That was not done
    and as stated, there was no application for adjournment to  either  the
    First-tier Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal.

16. I also note  that  in  submissions  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    appellant's representative accepted that  the  expert  was  a  suitable
    expert who had been living in the region and "was well placed  to  give
    this report." However, it was submitted that his  conclusions  were  at
    odds with his reasoning, which the First-tier Tribunal  addressed  from
    �25 of the decision.

17. The expert report tests the  hypothesis  that,  on  the  basis  of  the
    appellant's case, he belongs to the Rohingya linguistic  community.  As
    stated at �11 of the refusal decision, the  linguistic  analysis  found
    "with certainty" that the results were "clearly inconsistent" with  the
    Rohingya linguistic community which occurs in Myanmar. It is also noted
    that his knowledge of Myanmar when tested in his asylum  interview  was
    limited, inaccurate or incorrect, as explained between �13 and  �17  of
    the refusal decision, and leading to the conclusion that he is in  fact
    of Bangladeshi origin.

18. Mr Maqsood made a number of criticisms of the expert report,  including
    the expert's  confession  that  whilst  he  has  tentatively  indicated
    Chittagonian as an alternative hypothesis, Chittagonian is  not  within
    the analyst's area of expertise. Chittagonia is said to be part of  the
    same language continuum as Bengali and Rohingya, and is very  close  to
    Rohingya with many common dialectic features.

19. Mr Maqsood submitted that because the appellant was not aware  of  what
    words were relied from the short interview for the  language  analysis,
    he is not able to respond to it. However, this could easily  have  been
    addressed by asking for that information to  be  provided  and  if  the
    Secretary  of  State  was  dilatory  in  providing   the   information,
    directions could have been sought from the Tribunal.

20. In relation to this same issue, Mr Maqsood was also obliged to  concede
    that at �27 the judge cited in some detail  that  part  of  the  report
    setting out the phonology, which clearly includes words that were  used
    by the appellant and how they differ from Rohingya.  For  example,  the
    appellant used "certain fricatives" in his Rohingya  which  corresponds
    to plosives in Bengali, and deviates from Rohingya used in Myanmar. The
    first example is that the appellant used a 'k'  for  the  beginning  of
    certain words, when Rohingya uses 'h.' The words used are  clearly  set
    out in the report and  cited  by  the  judge  in  the  decision,  fully
    justifying  the  conclusion  of  the  expert   that   the   appellant's
    pronunciation deviates from Rohingya  in  a  number  of  ways.  Several
    examples are cited. Then at �28 the judge noted the comment at 3.3.5 of
    the report that the appellant frequently  uses  a  filler  word  'arki'
    which is not used in Rohingya.

21. Following this careful assessment, the judge noted at �30 that  "It  is
    clear in context that  the  expert  had  distinguished  with  care  the
    appellant's speech patterns from those of a  Rohingyan,  and  finds  no
    evidence that he is one." Thus the judge concluded  at  �31  "I  cannot
    find any basis to conclude that the appellant is or may be from Burma,"
    and so his appeal was dismissed on asylum grounds. The grounds complain
    that the judge 'praised' the expert when the judge was fully aware that
    the expert did not provide information as to  which  community  dialect
    was used in the Rohingya language, and which  words  and  phrases  were
    used. It is also complained of that the only 10  questions  were  asked
    within a 15-minute timespan, suggesting, according to the grounds  that
    this could not  have  been  a  fair,  objective  or  careful  analysis.
    However, these are all matters that go to weight of the evidence and in
    the absence of any expert evidence to suggest the expert was in any way
    mistaken in fact or theory, it was open to  the  judge  to  assess  the
    weight to be given to the expert report in the context of the  evidence
    as a whole.

22. I find it abundantly clear that the findings  and  conclusions  of  the
    judge were fully open to him  on  the  evidence  before  the  Tribunal.
    Indeed, I fail to see what other conclusion could have been reached  by
    any judge on that evidence, even taking full account of the  criticisms
    set out in the grounds  and  advanced  before  me  by  Mr  Maqsood.  In
    essence, the grounds are little  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
    findings and conclusions of the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusion & Decision

23. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did make an anonymity order. Given the  circumstances,  I  continue
the anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011). However, I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
