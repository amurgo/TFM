Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Malik, Counsel, instructed by Westminster Law
      Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr Saunders (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, born January 1, 1960, is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan.  The
    appellant entered the  United  Kingdom  in  1993  and  claimed  he  was
    apprehended and fingerprinted by Immigration Officers. On  February  1,
    2011 he applied for indefinite leave to remain on  the  grounds  of  14
    years unlawful residence. His  application  was  initially  refused  on
    March 10, 2011 but was reconsidered on December 17, 2012  and  refused.
    The appellant only received that decision on July 23, 2013.

 2. On August 3, 2013 the appellant appealed under  section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3.  The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Kaler
    (hereinafter referred to as "the FtTJ") on March  17,  2014  and  in  a
    determination promulgated on March 20, 2014 she found the appellant had
    been here for at least fourteen years but dismissed  his  appeal  under
    paragraph 276(i)(c) of the Immigration Rules finding he had  failed  to
    provide evidence that he had passed  the  relevant  English  test.  She
    recorded at paragraph [27] of her determination that  no  evidence  the
    appellant had passed the test had been submitted and there had been  no
    submissions made to her either in the written evidence or orally by the
    appellant's representative, Mr Malik.

 4. The appellant appealed that decision on March 27, 2014.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted on May 1, 2014 by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Levin on the basis the FtTJ had overlooked the fact the certificate was
    actually in the appellant's bundle.

 5. There was no Rule 24 response from the respondent.

 6. The matter was listed before me on the above date and the appellant was
    in attendance.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 7. I checked the appellant's bundle and noted  that  the  certificate  and
    accompanying letter were contained between pages  14  and  16.  I  also
    checked the FtTJ's notes of hearing and noted she had recorded that  Mr
    Malik had addressed her on the certificate  and  specifically  referred
    her to the pages in the aforementioned bundle.

 8. I invited observations from Mr Saunders and he accepted  the  FtTJ  had
    materially erred and he invited  me  to  remake  the  decision  on  the
    evidence before me.

 9. I did not require any submissions from Mr Malik  because  no  challenge
    was being made to the certificate in the bundle and  as  this  was  the
    only outstanding issue I indicated I intended to allow the appeal.

10. The FtTJ had accepted all other requirements of the Rules were met with
    the exception of the correct certificates.  The  evidence  was  in  the
    bundle and I was satisfied the Rules were met.




    DECISION

11. There was a material error of law. I have remade  the  decision  and  I
    allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules.


12. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.

TO THE RESPONDENT

I make no fee award as no application was made to me.
