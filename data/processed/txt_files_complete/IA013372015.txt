                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Somal  promulgated  23.6.15,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated
    18.12.14, to refuse her application made on 8.4.14  to  vary  leave  to
    enter or remain in the UK and to remove her from  the  UK  pursuant  to
    section 47 of Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 8.6.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Molloy  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    17.9.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 3.11.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.





Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below I found such error of law in  the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Somal to be set aside and remade. For  the  reasons  given,  I
    have dismissed the appeal.

 5. The relevant background can be summarised as follows. The claimant  and
    her husband, a British citizen, married in Nigeria. He returned to  the
    UK after the marriage. The claimant applied for entry  clearance  as  a
    family visitor on the assertion that she intended to remain only a  few
    weeks and certainly no more than the permitted 6  months.  She  entered
    the UK on 25.2.14 accompanied by her  two-month  old  daughter.  A  few
    weeks later, on 8.4.14, she applied for leave to remain as a spouse  of
    a person settled in the UK. To Judge Somal she stated that, "she  found
    it to be such a relief to be living with him and the baby once she  was
    here." She also told me that she fully intended to return.  She  relied
    on the fact that she discovered that she had TB and began a  course  of
    NHS medical treatment.

 6. Her application was first refused on 5.6.14,  but  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge McGinty allowed the appeal on 6.11.14  by  purportedly  remitting
    the case to the Secretary of State, on the basis that there had been no
    consideration of the best interests of the  claimant's  daughter.   The
    application was thus reconsidered, both under the Rules and outside the
    Rules under article 8 ECHR, taking account of the duty to  have  regard
    to the best interests of the child,  pursuant  to  section  55  of  the
    Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. The application was again
    refused on 17.12.14, with a decision to remove the  claimant  from  the
    UK. It is against that decision the claimant appealed to the First-tier
    Tribunal.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Somal found that the claimant could not  meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules for  leave  to  remain  as  a
    spouse under Appendix FM,  or  on  the  basis  of  private  life  under
    paragraph 276ADE. In particular, the claimant  is  not  eligible  under
    Appendix FM as  having  entered  as  a  visitor  she  fails  under  the
    eligibility requirements of E-LTRP 2.1. As such the claimant  does  not
    get as far as consideration of the exceptions under EX1. However, Judge
    Somal considered EX1(a) and (b), concluding  that  the  claimant  could
    meet  neither  exception.  The  judge  found   that   there   were   no
    insurmountable obstacles preventing her  from  continuing  family  life
    with her British citizen partner in Nigeria. "Her husband is a  British
    citizen who has lived in the UK over 20 years and almost all his  life.
    With the assistance of the appellant and her family he would be able to
    adjust to life in Nigeria with their baby. It would be  very  difficult
    but no more than that."

 8. Similarly, the judge considered paragraph 276ADE, concluding  that  the
    claimant has family in Nigeria, where she has spent the  vast  majority
    of her life. "Although she may face some difficulty upon return, she is
    well educated and has lived there 28 years she has not lost all ties to
    Nigeria. I do not find there would be very significant obstacles to her
    integration to Nigeria if required to leave."

 9. The judge then went on from �15  to  consider  article  8  outside  the
    Rules. However, this approach was flawed. As confirmed  in  SSHD  v  SS
    (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA 387, it is necessary only to consider article
    8  outside  the   Rules   if   there   are   compelling   circumstances
    insufficiently recognised in the Rules which would render the  decision
    unjustifiably harsh. In MS v SSHD [2013] CSIH 52 it was held  that  the
    new Immigration Rules would be likely to deal adequately with the great
    majority of cases where Article 8 rights to family life were  in  issue
    and that in that event there was no need to go on to consider Article 8
    separately using the analysis set out  in  Razgar,  unless  a  refusal,
    under the Immigration Rules, would result  in  an  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequence  for  an  appellant  such  that  refusal   would   not   be
    proportionate.

10.  Judge  Somal  made  no  consideration  at  all  as  to   whether   the
    circumstances of the claimant, her husband  or  their  child,  were  so
    compelling as to require an assessment outside the Rules on  the  basis
    of private and/or family life under article  8  ECHR.  Given  that  the
    judge found that the  claimant  could  meet  neither  Appendix  FM  nor
    paragraph 276ADE, having applied the tests of insurmountable  obstacles
    and very significant obstacles, it is difficult to see  why  the  judge
    considered that further consideration of private or family life outside
    the Rules was justified.

11. Further, case law has made it clear that even if article 8 ECHR  is  to
    be considered, the assessment has to be made through the  lens  of  the
    Immigration Rules, the Secretary of State's  response  to  private  and
    family life claims under article 8, balancing those human  rights  with
    the public interest in maintaining immigration control.  This  was  not
    the approach adopted by Judge Somal. On the  findings  in  relation  to
    insurmountable obstacles and very significant obstacles,  there  is  no
    basis or need to consider private and family life outside the Rules, as
    the  considerations  within  the  Rules  amount  to  a  proportionality
    assessment between the rights of the claimant and her family on the one
    hand and the legitimate and on the other the necessary aim of the state
    to protect the  economic  well-being  of  the  UK  through  immigration
    control.

12. It is beyond comprehension how the judge could  reach  the  conclusions
    that there are no insurmountable obstacles  preventing  the  claimant's
    family life continuing with her husband and child in Nigeria, and  that
    there are no very significant obstacles to the claimant continuing  her
    private life  in  Nigeria  and  yet  find  at  �19  that  it  would  be
    "unreasonable and unduly harsh to expect the husband to uproot and move
    to Nigeria given the life he has made for himself in the UK.  It  would
    be unduly harsh to expect the appellant to leave her baby  behind  with
    her husband and make an application for entry  clearance  from  Nigeria
    with no real indication whether it would be a matter of weeks  or  many
    months." The two sets of findings are entirely inconsistent  with  each
    other.

13. Even if the judge was justified in considering article  8  outside  the
    Rules, the assessment failed  to  consider  the  extent  to  which  the
    claimant did not meet the requirements of the Rules  or  whether  there
    was any prospect that the claimant could meet the requirements of entry
    clearance as a partner. In considering that it would be unduly harsh to
    expect her to leave her child behind  with  her  husband  and  make  an
    application from outside the UK, the judge failed to  take  account  of
    the decision in R (on the application of Chen) v SSHD  (Appendix  FM  -
    Chikwamba - temporary separation -  proportionality)  ILR  [2015]  UKUT
    00189, where it was held that "if it is shown  by  an  individual  (the
    burden being upon him or her) that an application for  entry  clearance
    from abroad would be  granted  and  that  there  would  be  significant
    interference with family life by temporary removal, the  weight  to  be
    accorded to the formal requirement  of  obtaining  entry  clearance  is
    reduced." No such evidence had been adduced to show that  the  claimant
    would meet the requirements of the Rules. In fact,  she  entered  on  a
    family visit visa because they could not meet the requirements  of  the
    Rules, particularly in relation to the financial income  threshold.  In
    effect, they  have  sought  to  circumvent  the  Immigration  Rules  by
    applying for leave to remain once the claimant and her daughter entered
    the UK.

14. In all the circumstances, the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    flawed, demonstrating a misconception of the correct legal  principles,
    and cannot stand.

15. In remaking the decision in the appeal I adopt all the factual findings
    set out in the First-tier Tribunal decision and there is  no  need  for
    any  further  evidence.  However,  in  her  submissions  to   me,   the
    unrepresented claimant pleaded to be considered as a special case.  She
    said that they knew they did not meet the requirements  of  the  Rules,
    but that they could not live or survive in Nigeria as her husband would
    have no job to go do. In essence she  submitted  that  they  should  be
    allowed to remain on human rights grounds outside the Rules. She  added
    that her daughter, a citizen of Nigeria, is in school  in  the  UK  and
    that she is being treated for TB, which she claimed  she  was  entitled
    to.

16. I take into account the best interests of  the  child  of  the  family.
    However, it is clearly in the best interests of that  child  to  remain
    with and be raised by both of her parents. The child is not  a  British
    citizen and has no entitlement to remain or be educated in the UK.

17. As is common ground, the claimant cannot meet the requirements  of  the
    Rules for leave to remain as a partner or as the parent of a child,  or
    on the basis of private life. I am not satisfied on the facts  of  this
    case that there are any compelling  circumstances  at  all  to  justify
    granting leave to remain outside the Rules on the basis that to  remove
    the   claimant   would   be   unduly   or   unjustifiably   harsh    or
    disproportionate.

18. Even if it were appropriate to consider their circumstances outside the
    Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR, which I do  not  accept,  I  also
    find that in applying the Razgar  staged  approach,  there  is  nothing
    disproportionate  or  unjustifiably  harsh  in  the  decision  of   the
    Secretary of State to remove the claimant.

19. Any article 8 assessment has to take account  of  to  what  extent  the
    claimant met the requirements of the Rules.  Whilst  any  consideration
    under Appendix FM fails at the eligibility requirements, and  thus  EX1
    does not apply, I adopt the unappealed findings and reasoning of  Judge
    Somal that on the EX1 assessment there are no insurmountable  obstacles
    to continuing family life in Nigeria. The claimant has  lived  most  of
    her life in Nigeria, where  she  has  family  as  well  as  social  and
    cultural ties. Her very young daughter was born in Nigeria and  is  too
    young to have formed any associations or attachment outside the  family
    unit. Obviously the husband, as a British citizen, cannot  be  required
    to leave the UK; it is matter for him whether  he  will  accompany  the
    claimant to Nigeria, where he was born. But  the  fact  that  he  is  a
    British citizen, settled, and employed in the UK, does not entitle  the
    claimant, by those facts alone, to settle with him and  their  daughter
    in the UK. The state owes him no entitlement to a home or employment in
    Nigeria or the UK. They married at a time when it was  far  from  clear
    that the claimant would ever be able to settle with him in the  UK  and
    thus took the risk that they would not be able to continue family  life
    in the UK.

20. There is a route for entry as a partner, which it appears the  claimant
    cannot meet. She certainly cannot meet the route for leave to remain as
    a partner and this is highly relevant to any article 8  proportionality
    assessment. It has  not  been  shown  that  she  would  succeed  in  an
    application for entry clearance. It is  a  matter  for  the  couple  to
    decide whether to separate whilst she makes application  from  Nigeria,
    or whether they should all  go  together.  However,  there  is  nothing
    unreasonable or unduly harsh in the expectation  of  continuing  family
    life outside the UK.

21. I have taken into account that the claimant is receiving  TB  treatment
    in the UK. It is questionable whether she is in fact entitled  to  such
    medical treatment from the NHS free of charge, but the claimant has not
    shown that she would be unable to obtain suitable treatment in Nigeria,
    which has a functioning health system. That she is receiving  treatment
    does not render her removal disproportionate.

22. Section 117B of the 2002 Act requires the Tribunal to take  account  of
    the fact that immigration control is in the public  interest  and  that
    little weight should be given to any private life developed in  the  UK
    whilst her immigration status was precarious, as it was.  The  decision
    of the Secretary of State  does  not  require  the  separation  of  the
    family, but neither are they entitled to settle as a family in  the  UK
    just because that is their choice and they happen to have contrived  to
    be together.

23. In all the circumstances, it is clear that there is  no  merit  in  the
    claimant's application, either under  the  Immigration  Rules  or  even
    outside the Rules on the basis of private and family life under article
    8 ECHR.

Conclusions:

24. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee  award.
I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
