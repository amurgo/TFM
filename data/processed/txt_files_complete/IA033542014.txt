Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Martin, Counsel, instructed by Nag Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Rahman, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal  against  the  refusal  of  a  residence  card  under
    Regulation 17 of the 2006  Regulations.   Following  an  error  of  law
    hearing at Field House on 23 October  2014  I  set  aside  a  decision
    dismissing the appellant's appeal,  and  the  matter  was  subsequently
    listed for a remaking hearing before me.  My error of law decision  and
    directions, which sets out the immigration history, was as follows.

                    ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


        I. The appellant's appeal was heard jointly with that of his uncle,
           who is a citizen of Denmark.  His uncle's  appeal  was  allowed,
           but the appellant's appeal was dismissed, by First-tier Tribunal
           Judge Howard (determination promulgated 11  August  2014).   The
           appellant's appeal was dismissed on the basis that the appellant
           had not established that he had  been  dependent  on  his  uncle
           before coming to the UK to claim asylum.


       II. Permission to appeal was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
           Osborne.  The basis on which permission to appeal was sought was
           that various aspects of the evidence of dependency had not  been
           considered; and that the  judge  had  not  made  clear  findings
           covering the whole relevant period,  given  that  there  was  no
           requirement for the appellant to show that he had been dependent
           throughout.


      III. At the start of the hearing I indicated to the parties  that  it
           appeared to me that there was an additional  significant  point.
           This was that the judge did not appear to have  referred  to  or
           applied the relevant test for dependency in European  cases,  as
           set out in the Jia case (Yung Ying Jia v Migrationsverket [2007]
           ECR 1-0001).


       IV. Mr Martin, for the appellant, submitted that there had been a 22
           year period where the appellant had been part  of  a  household,
           after the death of his father, and  he  did  not  need  to  show
           dependency for all of  that  period,  or  immediately  prior  to
           coming to the UK.  At paragraph 12 of Dauhoo, which was referred
           to in paragraph 20 of the judge's determination,  it  was  clear
           that continuous dependency could not be required.  On the  facts
           here there was dependency for around two years before he came to
           the UK.  The judge's reasoning was very short, with the evidence
           not  being  summarised  or  set  out  at  any  length,  and  not
           reflecting lengthy cross-examination.  The judge,  at  paragraph
           26 of the determination, only considered the position in  around
           the year 2000, the appellant having been in India  for  most  of
           the 1990s.  There was sufficient detail in the evidence to  show
           the extent of his reliance  on  his  uncle,  both  when  he  was
           working, and when he was not.


        V. Having listened to Mr Martin's submissions Mr  Walker,  for  the
           respondent, agreed that the judge had erred in law, in a  manner
           material to the outcome,  in  his  approach  to  the  dependency
           issue.


       VI. In view of this agreement, which appeared to me  to  be  soundly
           based, there is no need for me to set out in detail an  analysis
           of paragraphs 23 to 27 of the determination.  Although the judge
           referred to the Dauhoo case at paragraph 20 of the determination
           it does appear that the broad brush finding at paragraph  27  of
           the determination cannot  be  said  to  engage  with  the  legal
           framework as required by that  case.   Within  the  findings  at
           paragraphs 23 to 27 there is insufficient  detail  to  establish
           whether the appellant did meet the requirements set out  in  the
           Dauhoo case, and whether he met the requirements for  dependency
           in view of the Jia test.   There  is  a  significant  difference
           between the test of dependency in European cases and  under  the
           Immigration Rules, and from the determination it  is  not  clear
           what test the judge had in mind.


      VII. The parties were in agreement that the  decision  needed  to  be
           remade, and that this required further  evidence.   The  parties
           were in agreement that the remaking  should  remain  within  the
           Upper Tribunal, following the normal  course  suggested  in  the
           Practice Statement.  Neither  side  suggested  that  the  matter
           should be remitted to the First-tier.


     VIII. Following the agreement of the parties I therefore set aside the
           decision dismissing  this  appellant's  appeal  under  the  2006
           Regulations.  The matter will be listed for a  remaking  hearing
           in the Upper Tribunal.


Discussion

2.   In a discussion of the issues of  the  start  of  the  hearing  it  was
    agreed, between the parties, that the appellant had been dependent  on,
    and a member of the household of, his Danish uncle  (his  uncle)  since
    arrival in the UK in 2002.  It was also  agreed  that  the  appellant's
    uncle, who is his mother's brother, has been a citizen of Denmark since
    1994, having fled Sri Lanka and claimed asylum there in 1984; and  that
    the appellant's uncle has been resident in the UK from 1999.

3.   It was agreed that the issue to be decided was  whether  the  appellant
    could establish, on a  balance  of  probabilities,  that  he  had  been
    dependent on his uncle  before  the  appellant  came  to  the  UK;  and
    whether, on the facts, the appellant could satisfy Regulation  8(2)  of
    the 2006 Regulations.

4.   The appellant and his uncle both gave  evidence  at  the  hearing,  and
    were cross-examined.

5.   The appellant's representatives had prepared a bundle of documents  for
    the  remaking  hearing  (eight  pages),  which  included  new   witness
    statements for both witnesses.  I was also referred to the  appellant's
    bundle prepared for the First-tier hearing (22 pages), which  contained
    earlier  witness  statements  from  July  2014;  and  a  copy  of   the
    appellant's witness statement and  Asylum  Interview  Record  from  the
    asylum claim that he made in October 2002, shortly after  his  arrival.
    Neither side made any mention of the asylum process, but I assume  that
    the claim was  refused  and  all  challenges  by  way  of  appeal  were
    unsuccessful.  Neither side provided or referred to  any  determination
    or other documents relating to the asylum refusal or appeal process.

6.   It appears that there was an earlier  unsuccessful  application  for  a
    residence card in 2006, but the current application, which led  to  the
    refusal dated 2 January 2014, was made in November 2013.

7.   I was provided with a number of relevant  decisions,  to  which  I  was
    referred.  These included Oboh and Others v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ  1525;
    Moneke and Others Nigeria [2011] UKUT 341 (IAC); the Jia  case;  Dauhoo
    (EEA Regulations - reg 8(2)) [2012] UKUT  79.   Within  the  Oboh  case
    there is reference to the CJEU case of Rahman  [2013]  QB249  (Case  C-
    83/11).

8.   In outline the account of the chronology and factual circumstances  was
    as follows.  The appellant's  father  was  killed  in  1978,  when  the
    appellant was only around 4 years old (the exact date of death was  not
    specified).   The  appellant's  uncle  took  on,  at  the   appellant's
    grandmother's request, responsibility for his late brother's widow  and
    children.  The appellant's mother had  health  and  other  difficulties
    after her husband's death.  Between 1978 and 1984, when the appellant's
    uncle and his family had to flee Sri Lanka,  the  appellant  was  in  a
    household that was  financially  dependent  on  his  uncle.   When  the
    appellant was around 16 or 17 years of age, in 1989 to  1990,  he  left
    the household of his mother and grandmother and went to  stay  with  an
    aunt.  In the early 1990s the appellant and one of his sisters went  to
    Chennai in India, and they were  followed  shortly  afterwards  by  the
    appellant's  mother  and  another  of  his  sisters.   The  appellant's
    maternal grandmother died in 1996.

9.   As refugees in India the family circumstances were difficult, and  they
    relied on money sent to them by the  appellant's  uncle  from  Denmark.
    The appellant was able to find work, and also married, in 2000, and had
    a child, in 2001.

10.  For reasons connected with his asylum account the  appellant  left  his
    wife and children in India and returned to Sri Lanka for about  a  year
    between 2001 and 2002.  During this period his uncle continued to  send
    money to the family in India, but did not send  any  to  the  appellant
    himself.  During this time the appellant was dependent  on  a  paternal
    uncle in Sri Lanka, who subsequently arranged and paid for his  journey
    to the UK.

11.  The appellant's uncle gave various reasons for having  been  unable  to
    provide much in the way of documentary evidence to  show  that  he  had
    sent money to the appellant and his family.  One  of  the  reasons  put
    forward was a burglary that had occurred in 2001, in which a number  of
    personal documents, including passports and  financial  documents,  had
    been stolen.  The only money transfer documents put  forward  were  one
    from July 1996, showing that the appellant's uncle sent $3,000  to  the
    appellant's older sister  in  Chennai;  and  one  from  November  2000,
    showing a transfer to the same person of �2,000.

12.   Following  the  conclusion  of  the  oral  evidence  both  sides  made
    submissions on factual and legal issues.  I will summarise the  factual
    submissions.  First, those by Ms Rahman, for the respondent, were that
    variances in the evidence, and the  paucity  of  documentary  evidence,
    meant that the burden of proof had not  been  discharged.   There  were
    three different versions about the circumstances before  the  appellant
    came to the UK.  In the asylum witness statement and interview  he  had
    said that he left his grandmother's household in about 1990,  and  went
    to his paternal uncle.  In the witness statements  for  the  July  2014
    First-tier hearing both the appellant and his uncle had said  that  the
    appellant was not really dependent on his uncle from 1990  onwards.  In
    the latest witness statements both were claiming that  there  had  been
    financial dependency after the appellant left his grandmother's  house,
    and when he was in India.

13.  On the factual issues Mr Martin's submissions for the appellant can  be
    summarised as follows.  The  limited  documentary  evidence  should  be
    assessed in view of the comments in the Jia case (paragraph  41)  which
    had decided that dependency could be  established  by  any  appropriate
    means.  The appellant's uncle's evidence had  been  credible.   It  was
    likely that he would have promised his mother that he would look  after
    his sister and her family after his brother-in-law's death.  During the
    asylum interview and witness statement the period in India had not been
    mentioned at all, because it was not relevant.  The period  before  the
    appellant's uncle became a  Danish  citizen  in  1994  was  anyway  not
    relevant.  The witness statements for the First-tier hearing should  be
    read not as inconsistent but rather as insufficiently  detailed.   They
    had been drafted without  an  appreciation  of  the  detail  needed  to
    establish whether there was dependency after 1994.  The current witness
    statements and oral evidence should be accepted.  Within the context of
    Sri Lankan refugees in India it was likely that they would have  needed
    financial help.  It was also likely that they would have  pooled  their
    resources as a family, as described, and  it  would  not  be  right  to
    separate out the appellant as if he were an isolated  individual.   The
    money transfer  documents  from  1996  and  from  2000  were  for  very
    substantial sums, which would have gone a long way  in  supporting  the
    family in India.

Findings

14.  I accept the submission made that there were discrepancies between  the
    different statements, but in looking at the evidence as a whole I  have
    decided that the appellant has done enough to  establish  that  he  was
    dependent on his uncle, both in Sri Lanka and India,  for  the  periods
    set out above.

15.  It is important to note, in my view, that the asylum witness  statement
    and interview were concerned with different matters.  No mention at all
    was made of the appellant's time  in  India.   The  focus  was  on  his
    account of detentions, through political  connections,  and  of  having
    been tortured.  In the witness statements prepared for  the  First-tier
    hearing there  were  two  sentences  that  were  damaging,  but  it  is
    significant that the issue of financial dependency  in  India  was  not
    considered in any detail.  The entire period from  when  the  appellant
    went to India is dealt with in a single  sentence.   On  this  point  I
    accept, to an extent, the submission made  on  the  appellant's  behalf
    that these can be read more  as  lacking  detail  than  being  directly
    contradictory.  It appears to me to be likely that the person  drafting
    the brief statements, which only ran to eight short paragraphs,  simply
    failed  to  appreciate  the  significance  of  the  period  in   India,
    apparently being  under  the  impression  that  the  dependency  before
    leaving the  appellant's  grandmother's  household  was  sufficient  in
    itself to establish what was needed.

16.  The appellant had some difficulty  in  remembering  dates,  during  his
    oral evidence, but I accept that many of the points that he  was  asked
    about are now many years in the past.  I also conclude that all of  his
    answers,  whilst  approximate,  were  consistent   with   the   overall
    chronology put forward at various  different  times.   The  appellant's
    uncle appeared to me to be a credible  and  reliable  witness.   Whilst
    there are certain issues in relation to  the  appellant's  credibility,
    given that this must have been  rejected  during  the  asylum  decision
    making and appeal process, no such issues  exist  in  relation  to  the
    appellant's uncle.  It appears to me that  he  has  put  forward  valid
    reasons for the difficulties that he has faced in providing documentary
    evidence.  I note that the account that he gave of the 2001 burglary is
    supported by a short newspaper story, from that date.  This  aspect  of
    his evidence was not challenged.  I also note that there are two  money
    transfer documents,  neither  of  which  were  challenged,  which  show
    transfers of very significant sums.  Although it is the case that there
    is no documentary evidence to support the  claim  of  significant  sums
    having been sent approximately every two months, the sum of $3,000 sent
    in 1996, and that of �2,000 sent in 2000, would have  been  large  sums
    for a Sri Lankan family living as refugees in southern India.

17.  I also accept that an assessment of the evidence  as  a  whole  has  to
    take in the overall context.  I accept  that  it  is  likely  that  the
    financial and general circumstances for a family of Sri Lankan refugees
    in southern India during those years would have  been  difficult.   The
    account given of them relying on funds sent from the appellant's  uncle
    in Denmark, and subsequently the UK, as well as a  reference  to  funds
    sent  from  another  aunt  in  Norway,  is  plausible  in  the  overall
    circumstances.

18.  It does appear to me to be  unlikely  that  the  appellant  would  have
    separated himself financially, once he was earning  a  wage  in  India,
    from the  rest  of  the  family.   Taking  into  account  his  sister's
    disability, and his mother's health problems, it  appears  to  me  more
    likely than not that his evidence, and that of his uncle, to the effect
    that resources were shared amongst the family, was accurate.

19.  For all of these reasons, having considered the evidence  as  a  whole,
    my finding is  that  the  appellant  has  established,  on  balance  of
    probabilities, that he was financially dependent on his uncle from  the
    date of his father's death onwards.  The periods in  which  he  can  be
    said not to have been dependent are those in which he was dependent  on
    his paternal uncle, for a period of about two years in his late  teens,
    before he went to India, and again for a period of about a year  before
    he left Sri Lanka for the last time.  Since arrival in the UK  in  2002
    it has, as mentioned above, been accepted that he  has  been  dependent
    on, and a member of the household of, his uncle.

20.  In my view  the  dependency  between  the  period  of  the  appellant's
    father's death in 1978 and him going to stay with  his  aunt  in  about
    1990 is clear cut.  The appellant was a child and  he  was  part  of  a
    household that was dependent on his uncle.  Between approximately  1992
    and August 2001 the level of the appellant's dependency  on  his  uncle
    varied.  At first it would have been nearly total.  After  he  obtained
    employment in India, from the mid-1990s until he returned to Sri  Lanka
    in August 2001, it would have been reduced.  Taking  into  account  the
    needs of his mother and sisters, however, and bearing in mind  that  he
    had never set up an independent household, it appears to  me  that  the
    correct way of looking at this is to say that he was part of  a  family
    unit that remained dependent on his uncle for essential needs,  despite
    the appellant's earnings contributing to the family's overall financial
    circumstances.

21.  My overall finding, therefore, is that the  appellant  has  established
    dependency within the Jia test, that is to say to meet essential needs,
    for all periods from 1978 onwards, with the exception  of  two  periods
    between 1990 and 1992, and between August 2001 and October 2002.  Given
    the fact that it was agreed that the relevant  periods  only  postdated
    the appellant's uncle becoming a Danish citizen in 1994  the  first  of
    these periods when he was not dependent predates that.  The only period
    that postdates it is that between 2001 and 2002.

Legal Submissions

22.  The main submission by Ms Rahman, for the  respondent,  relied  on  the
    Oboh  case,  paragraphs  55  and  56.   Her  submission  was  that  the
    continuity of the appellant's dependence was broken by the period  when
    he was in Sri Lanka, before coming to the UK.  For that reason  he  did
    not meet the requirements of Regulation 8(2).

23.  Mr Martin, for the appellant, accepted that the appellant had not  been
    continuously dependent since 1994, and also accepted that the appellant
    had not been dependent immediately prior  to  coming  to  the  UK,  but
    submitted that this did not prevent him from meeting  the  requirements
    of Regulation 8(2).  He referred to paragraph 43 of the Jia case, which
    referred to dependency at the time of application.  Paragraph 56 of the
    Oboh case suggested that this  was  conditional.   The  description  in
    Dauhoo at paragraphs 9 and 12 of the prior test  suggested  that  prior
    dependency could be at any time prior to arrival in the  UK,  and  also
    suggested that there was no need for the dependency to be continuous.

Discussion

24.  On looking at the passages to which I was referred it  did  not  appear
    to me that any of them settled the point at issue.   In  attempting  to
    provide some clarity I followed a chain  of  research  leading  to  the
    Court of Appeal judgment in Aladeselu v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 144.  This
    was not an authority that had been considered at the hearing.   I  have
    considered recalling the parties but have decided this is not required.
     The point at issue was identified well in advance, and both sides  had
    researched the matter.  The above case is neither particularly  recent,
    nor obscure.  On that basis it appears to me to be a general  authority
    on which I can rely without unfairness to the parties.

25.  The key passages that appear to me to be of relevance are  at  the  end
    of paragraph 47, and  the  whole  of  paragraph  48.   What  was  being
    considered in the Aladeselu case was  the  question  of  whether  other
    family members could succeed under Regulation 8(2)  even  if  they  had
    arrived in the UK before their EEA sponsor.  At the end of paragraph 47
    Lord Justice Richards concluded that  the  formulation  in  the  Rahman
    case, that the situation of dependence must exist in the country at the
    time of  applying  to  join  the  Union  citizen,  was  "a  formulation
    appropriate to the particular circumstances  of  the  case  (where  the
    applications were made by persons outside the host Member State) rather
    than laying down a principle of universal applicability."

26.  Paragraph 48 is then as follows:

         "Thus, whilst Rahman  establishes  the  need  for  a  situation  of
         dependence in the country from which the  applicant  comes,  and  a
         situation of dependence at the date of the application, it  is  not
         to be read as laying down a requirement that the dependency at  the
         date of the application must be  dependency  in  the  country  from
         which the applicant comes,  such  that  a  relative  who  has  been
         dependent throughout cannot qualify  if  he  arrives  in  the  host
         Member State many months before the EU citizen and  the  making  of
         the application."

27.  Applying this to the current situation it is the  case  here  that  the
    appellant applied as a dependent of his uncle in  2006,  and  again  in
    2013.  At both of these times it appears to be  accepted  that  he  was
    dependent, and a member of this uncle's household.  In accordance  with
    Aladeselu the requirement from the Rahman case should  not  be  one  of
    dependency in Sri Lanka at  the  time  that  the  appellant  left  that
    country, that is to say the  time  at  which  he  would  have  made  an
    application as a dependent of his uncle, if that was what had happened,
    instead of him coming to apply for asylum.

28.  What this does not  settle  precisely,  however,  is  the  question  of
    whether there has to be dependency in the period immediately before  an
    applicant leaves  their  own  country.   Neither  does  it  settle  the
    question of whether dependency can be broken.  It is notable  that,  at
    paragraph 48 quoted above, the hypothetical factual scenario  concerned
    a person who had been "dependent throughout".

29.  Turning to Regulation 8(2) itself, however, it  does  appear  that  the
    approach offers some guidance.  What is required by Regulation  8(2)(c)
    is that the appellant continues to be dependent, and that he  satisfied
    the condition in paragraph (a) at some time  in  the  past.   Paragraph
    8(2)(a) does not specify a particular  time,  and  is  in  the  present
    tense.  There is nothing to say that the dependency  or  membership  of
    household has to be continuous, and nothing to say that it has to be in
    place immediately before the appellant leaves his own country.

30.  I also note the observation in Moneke  and  Others,  that  the  country
    from which the OFM has come can be either the country from which he  or
    she has come to the UK or his country of  origin.   In  this  case  the
    appellant was dependent on his uncle when he was a  refugee  in  India,
    but was not dependent on him immediately  before  he  left  Sri  Lanka,
    although he had been dependent on  him  in  Sri  Lanka  at  an  earlier
    period.

31.  Having considered the various points made, and the cases  referred  to,
    I have therefore decided that the facts of this case do not  place  the
    appellant outside the conditions set out in Regulation 8(2).   This  is
    because he was dependent on his uncle in Sri Lanka and India,  and  the
    dependence in India postdated the appellant's  uncle  becoming  an  EEA
    national.  The wording of Regulation 8(2) does not  appear  to  justify
    the introduction of an additional test of the dependency being  for  an
    unbroken continuous period, and neither does it appear to me to include
    any requirement that  there  must  be  continuous  unbroken  dependency
    leading up to the point at which the appellant left Sri Lanka.

32.  The consequence of this is that the appellant  is  an  extended  family
    member within Regulation 8 of  the  2006  Regulations.   What  remains,
    therefore, is the Secretary  of  State's  discretion  under  Regulation
    17(4)  as  to  whether  a  residence  card  should  be  issued.   Under
    Regulation 17(5) what is now required is "an extensive  examination  of
    the personal circumstances of the applicant".

33.  As  I  have  said  I  have  not  been  provided  with  details  of  the
    appellant's asylum claim, and the appeal  process.   It  is  not  clear
    whether any allegations have been made against him,  such  as  that  he
    made particular attempts to mislead during this process, or whether  it
    is merely a matter  of  his  account  having  been  disbelieved,  or  a
    conclusion having been reached that he had told the truth but would not
    have been at risk for various reasons.  It  is  not  clear  what  other
    considerations might be relevant.  The appellant's representatives  may
    wish to submit representations about his personal circumstances,  which
    could include any relevant  medical  evidence,  or  any  other  matters
    relevant to the nature of the appellant's links with his uncle, and any
    other relatives in the UK.

34.  It was not suggested by  either  side  that  there  was  any  need  for
    anonymity in this appeal.  The outcome of the appeal appears to  me  to
    have rested on matters not put forward at  the  application  stage.   I
    have therefore decided, despite the outcome, that it is not appropriate
    to make a fee award.

Notice of Decision

35.  The decision dismissing the appeal  having  been  set  aside,  for  the
    reasons given above, the decision in the appeal is remade as follows.

36.   The appeal is allowed on the  basis  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law. The application therefore remains outstanding,
    awaiting the  exercise  of  discretion  as  to  whether  to  issue  the
    appellant with a residence card as an extended family member of an  EEA
    national.
