                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1.     The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
         Tribunal  Judge  Cruthers  on  10   February   2015   against   the
         determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Stott who had  dismissed
         the Appellant's appeal under Appendix FM as the parent of a  United
         Kingdom settled child and on human rights (Article  8  ECHR  family
         life) grounds  against  his  removal  in  a  decision  and  reasons
         promulgated on 10 December 2014.

    2.     The Appellant is a national of India, born on  12  August  1980.
         The Appellant had entered as the  dependant  spouse  of  a  Tier  2
         migrant.  The Appellant and his spouse had subsequently  separated.
         Their son born in India on 20  August  2010  was  living  with  his
         United Kingdom settled mother.  The Appellant had  limited  contact
         rights which he had been seeking to extend.

    3.     Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Cruthers with  express
         reluctance because he considered that  it  was  arguable  that  the
         judge had erred by failing to provide an  adequate  explanation  of
         his reasons for rejecting evidence that the Appellant did not  have
         an active involvement in the life of his son, a potential  material
         error of law.

    4.     Standard directions were made by the tribunal,  indicating  that
         the appeal would be reheard immediately if a material error of  law
         were found.  No rule 24 notice had been filed on  the  Respondent's
         behalf, but Ms Brocklesby-Weller confirmed  at  the  start  of  the
         hearing that the appeal was opposed.

    Submissions - error of law

    5.     Mr Vokes for the Appellant relied on the grounds of  onwards  of
         appeal and the grant of permission to appeal. The judge had  failed
         to take account of the  evidence  before  him  of  the  Appellant's
         involvement in his son's  life  which  had  been  considerable  and
         active.  The father had been the primary carer  in  the  past.   RS
         (immigration and family court proceedings) India [2012] UKUT  00218
         (IAC) and RS (immigration/family court issues) India [2013] UKUT 82
         (IAC) were relevant.  There had been family  court  proceedings  on
         the same day as the First-tier Tribunal hearing, although Mr  Vokes
         candidly accepted that there had been  no  application  to  adjourn
         made on the Appellant's behalf to await the outcome.   The  judge's
         findings against the Appellant had  been  too  wide,  and  had  not
         factored in important positive findings such as  the  bond  between
         the son and his father. The  son's  best  interests  had  not  been
         properly considered.  The decision and reasons should be set aside.

    6.     Ms Brocklesby-Weller for  the  Respondent  opposed  the  onwards
         appeal.  The Appellant was simply seeking  to  attack  the  judge's
         findings of fact which had been open to him on the evidence  as  it
         stood on the day of the hearing.  There was no error of fact.   The
         CAFCASS  report  before  the  judge  was  very   recent   and   was
         independent, so he was entitled  to  give  weight  to  it.   Having
         access was a different matter from involvement, as the  Immigration
         Rules made clear.  The CAFCASS report showed that  there  had  been
         problems with contact.  The section 55 duty  had  been  discharged.
         The decision and reasons should stand.

    7.     Mr Vokes addressed the tribunal in reply.  The judge had  placed
         too much emphasis on the CAFCASS report rather than on  the  orders
         of the family court.  The judge's reasoning had been inadequate.

    8.     The tribunal indicated at the conclusion of submissions that its
         determination was reserved.

    No material error of law finding

    9.     There was evidence that matters between the  Appellant  and  his
         family have moved on since the date of  the  hearing  before  Judge
         Stott, but of course the tribunal can have no regard  to  any  post
         hearing developments. Nor can the tribunal substitute its  view  of
         the evidence.  The  issue  is  whether  the  findings  Judge  Stott
         reached were open to him.  The tribunal  has  concluded  that  they
         were.

    10.    The decision to proceed with  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
         when the family court was considering an application  for  parental
         contact by the Appellant on the same day elsewhere was a reasonable
         one.  There was no application to adjourn by either  party  and  it
         was in everyone's interests for the First-tier Tribunal  appeal  to
         proceed so that the Appellant knew where he stood in terms  of  his
         immigration status.  Permission to disclose the CAFCASS  report  to
         the First-tier Tribunal was in place, so the relevant evidence  was
         available.  The fact that the Appellant is  disappointed  with  the
         First-tier Tribunal's decision cannot amount to a procedural  error
         leading to unfairness.

    11.    On behalf of the Appellant the judge's reasoning  was  subjected
         to close scrutiny and a sustained challenge.  Sensibly it  was  not
         suggested that the judge's decision had  strayed  into  perversity.
         Plainly it had not.  In the tribunal's view the  challenge  in  the
         end amounted to disagreement  with  the  judge's  conclusions,  not
         material error of law.  No errors of fact were  identified  in  the
         decision and reasons.  There was no dispute that the Appellant  had
         acted as the Appellant's sole carer  for  three  months  ending  in
         February 2012 (prior to the son's first  birthday)  and  had  later
         shared his care until the marriage broke down.    These  and  other
         relevant facts were accurately recorded, including  the  fact  that
         the CAFCASS report made no mention that loss of  contact  with  the
         father  or  his  absence  would  be  detrimental  to  the   child's
         development.

    12.    As Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted, the CAFCASS report  to  which
         the judge gave weight was recent,  independent  and  balanced.  The
         report described various difficulties.  At the date of the  hearing
         the judge was entitled to  find,  and  gave  adequate  reasons  for
         finding, that the Appellant's rï¿½le had been limited to contact  and
         did not amount to active involvement.

    13.    The judge gave close attention to  the  Appellant's  son's  best
         interests, again with reference to  the  CAFCASS  report:  see,  in
         particular, [15], [23] and [24] of the decision  and  reasons.   He
         found that contact could be maintained between  the  Appellant  and
         his son by various means.  Again no error could be demonstrated  in
         that finding.

    14.     This  was  a  case  where  various  reasonable  but   differing
         conclusions could be properly  drawn  from  the  same  facts.   The
         conclusions the judge  reached  after  hearing  directly  from  the
         Appellant were proper and were adequately reasoned.   The  tribunal
         finds that there was no material error of law in the  decision  and
         reasons and there is no basis  for  interfering  with  the  judge's
         decision.

    DECISION

         The making of the previous decision did not involve the  making  of
         an error on a point of law and stands unchanged
