    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Ms A Everett a Senior
           Home Office Presenting Office
                            For the Respondent: The sponsor attended
           to represent his wife.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is the Entry Clearance Officer in Accra ("the ECO"). The
      respondent is a citizen of Sierra Leone who was  born  on  17  October
      1983 ("the claimant"). The ECO has been given permission to appeal the
      determination of First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Scott-Baker  ("the  FTTJ")
      who allowed, on Article 8 human rights grounds  only,  the  claimant's
      appealed against the ECO's decision of 23 October 2012  to  refuse  to
      grant her entry clearance for settlement in the UK as  the  spouse  of
      her husband and sponsor.


   2. The ECO refused the claimant's application because she had  not  shown
      that the sponsor was earning the minimum of �18,600 per annum required
      by the Immigration Rules. The claimant appealed and the FTTJ heard her
      appeal on for October 2013. The sponsor attended, made representations
      for his wife, and gave evidence. The respondent was represented.


   3. The FTTJ recorded that the ECO refused the application and the refusal
      was confirmed by the Entry Clearance  Manager  because  the  sponsor's
      contract of employment stated that he earned �17,939  per  annum.  His
      P60 showed an annual income of �14,528.53. Despite  the  inconsistency
      both amounts were below the required figure of �18,600 per annum.


   4. The FTTJ concluded that the claimant had to show that the sponsor  was
      earning the required amount at the  date  of  the  decision.  She  had
      failed to do so with the result that the appeal had  to  be  dismissed
      under the Immigration Rules. However, she said  that  there  was  post
      decision documentary evidence  in  the  form  of  a  letter  from  the
      sponsor's employers dated 6 November 2012 showing that at the date  of
      the decision the sponsor was earning 14,153 pa plus  an  allowance  of
      �4036 making a total of 18,189 and that this  could  be  increased  by
      overtime payments. There was some evidence of  overtime  payments  and
      his P60 issued in April  2013  showed  that  the  sponsor  had  earned
      �3305.19 more than his basic salary.


   5. Having dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules the FTTJ  went
      on to consider the Article 8 human rights grounds. In  paragraphs  14,
      15 and 16 of the determination she said;


         "14. However in considering the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR,
         I note that there was no issue raised by the  respondent  that  the
         appellant and sponsor were in a genuine relationship of husband-and-
         wife. Family life exists between the appellant and the sponsor  and
         the sponsor works in the United Kingdom and is  a  British  citizen
         and wishes his wife to join him so that they can  start  a  family.
         The appellant cannot satisfy the requirements  of  the  immigration
         rules as at the date hereof  as  she  has  not  produced  specified
         documents.


         15.  There  is  an  issue  here  in  that  the  evidence  has  been
         misconstrued by the respondent  and  the  appellant,  bar  for  the
         submission of specified documents, could have satisfied the rules.


         16. In  all  in  considering  the  evidence  in  the  round  it  is
         considered that the decision is disproportionate."


   6. The ECO applied for and  was  granted  permission  to  appeal.  It  is
      submitted that the FTTJ erred in law. The claimant had failed to  show
      that her circumstances were exceptional or that refusal  would  result
      in an unjustifiably harsh outcome. If the claimant could now show that
      the sponsor's income was sufficient to meet the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules  they  would  have  a  remedy,  by  making  a  fresh
      application.  It  is  also  argued  that  the  FTTJ  should  not  have
      considered evidence submitted after the ECO's decision and  failed  to
      give adequate reasons for her findings.


   7. The sponsor attended to represent the claimant. She  was  not  legally
      represented. I explained that my task was to decide whether  the  FTTJ
      erred in law, if so whether her decision should be set aside and if it
      was set aside how it should be remade. I explained what was  meant  by
      an error of law and said that I would  assist  him  as  best  I  could
      whilst maintaining a fair balance between the parties.


   8. I heard submissions from Ms Everett and from the sponsor. I also  took
      evidence from the sponsor in relation to remaking the decision, should
      that become necessary. I asked him questions, gave him the opportunity
      to say anything he wished and he was cross-examined. His  evidence  is
      set out in my record of proceedings and summarised in my findings.


   9. There is no cross appeal against the FTTJ's decision  to  dismiss  the
      appeal under the Immigration Rules. I  am  concerned  with  the  ECO's
      appeal against the FTTJ's decision to allow the appeal  on  Article  8
      human rights grounds.


  10. I find that the FTTJ erred in law. There are few findings  as  to  the
      relevant facts and little or no reasoning as to why the appeal  should
      be allowed on Article 8 human rights grounds. All that the  FTTJ  said
      is contained in paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 which I have set  out  above.
      Although not stated in terms what is said appears to  be  based  on  a
      view that the claimant suffered a "near miss"  under  the  Immigration
      Rules. There is no assessment of whether the claimant can  succeed  on
      Article 8 grounds as these are contained in the Immigration Rules  or,
      if she cannot, whether she can succeed under the jurisprudence outside
      the Immigration Rules applying Razgar principles. It was also an error
      of law to fail to take into account that, in the light of  the  FTTJ's
      own findings, the claimant was likely to succeed if she made  a  fresh
      application.


  11. Having found that the FTTJ erred in law I set aside  her  decision.  I
      have all the documents which were before the FTTJ  and  I  have  heard
      further evidence from the sponsor. The sponsor  and  Ms  Everett  have
      made submissions. In the circumstances I can re-determine  the  appeal
      without an adjournment.


  12. It is accepted that the claimant and the sponsor are married and in  a
      genuine and subsisting relationship. The  application  for  settlement
      only failed under the  Immigration  Rules  because,  at  the  date  of
      decision, the sponsor had not  produced  sufficient  evidence  in  the
      required form to show that he was earning at least  �18,600  pa.  Both
      are citizens of Sierra Leone. He was born in September 1979 and she in
      October 1983. He first came to the UK in May 2000 and has always  been
      here legally. He works in the NHS and has never claimed benefits.  His
      current salary is 21,484 pa which he  believes  is  sufficient  for  a
      fresh application to succeed. They married in December 2011 in  Sierra
      Leone. The claimant has a son, now aged nine, who lives with her.  The
      sponsor is his stepfather. They have no children together, but wish to
      start a family. The claimant and  her  son  live  with  the  sponsor's
      mother. The sponsor said that if the claimant came to this country her
      son would remain in Sierra Leone  with  his  mother.  The  reason  the
      sponsor gave is that they cannot show sufficient  earnings  to  enable
      them to make an application for him to come as well as  the  claimant.
      The sponsor last saw the claimant in Sierra Leone  in  July  2013.  He
      visits her as often as he can but is constrained by the cost  and  the
      27 days leave he can take from his work each year. He sends her  money
      each month to support her and to pay for his stepson's  education.  He
      said that their continuing separation was causing both of them a great
      deal of stress and strain which was beginning to affect his job.


  13. For  the  reasons  already  given  the  claimant  does  not  meet  the
      requirements of Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  cannot
      succeed on Article 8 human rights grounds under those rules unless she
      can bring herself within Section EX1. The only question as to  whether
      she does so depends on whether "there are insurmountable obstacles  to
      family life with that partner continuing outside the UK".  This  is  a
      test with a very high threshold. I find  that  the  claimant  has  not
      established that there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
      with the sponsor continuing outside the  UK,  specifically  in  Sierra
      Leone. Both are citizens of that country and the  claimant  is  living
      there with the sponsor's mother and her son. There  is  no  suggestion
      that the claimant or the sponsor do  not  enjoy  good  health.  He  is
      familiar with that country. On the other hand I accept that if he  had
      to leave the UK he would lose his private life here and a good job.


  14. As the claimant does not succeed on Article  8  human  rights  grounds
      under the Immigration Rules I must consider whether she succeeds under
      what I will refer to  as  the  Strasbourg  jurisprudence  outside  the
      Immigration Rules. In that context the test is not whether  there  are
      insurmountable obstacles to family life with  the  sponsor  continuing
      outside the UK. I must follow the principles set out by  Lord  Bingham
      in R v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  ex  parte  Razgar
      [2004] UKHL 27 namely;


         1) Will the  proposed  removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
            authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to  respect
            for his private or (as the case may be) family life?


         (2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity
         as potentially to engage the operation of article 8?


         (3) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


         (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic  society
         in the  interests  of  national  security,  public  safety  or  the
         ECOnomic well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder
         or crime, for the protection  of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the
         protection of the rights and freedoms of others?


         (5) If so, is such interference  proportionate  to  the  legitimate
         public end sought to be achieved?


  15. I find that there is a  family  life  between  the  claimant  and  the
      sponsor. I answer the first  four  of  the  Razgar  questions  in  the
      affirmative. In relation to the claimant's son  I  find  the  position
      more difficult. Whilst I accept that there is a  family  life  between
      the claimant the sponsor and the claimant's son and that  the  sponsor
      has come to treat him as his own son, the refusal  of  leave  for  the
      claimant to enter and settle will not be the decision which interferes
      with family life with the son. The reason is the decision taken by the
      claimant and the sponsor that their son should remain in Sierra  Leone
      with  the  sponsor's  mother.  In  the  circumstances  that  decision,
      although no doubt taken for sound reasons, would inevitably  interfere
      with his family life with his mother if she is granted leave  to  come
      to the UK. Whilst his best interests  are  a  paramount  consideration
      there is a dearth of evidence enabling me to  consider  this.  In  any
      event it is not the respondent's  current  decision  which  interferes
      with his family life although I  accept  that  at  some  time  in  the
      future, if the claimant  is  able  to  come  here,  there  may  be  an
      application for her son to join her and the sponsor.


  16. There is a public interest in upholding the Immigration Rules and  for
      this to be seen to be done. The claimant and the sponsor  now  believe
      that the sponsor's financial position is such that a fresh application
      would be likely to succeed. On the evidence he  has  put  forward  and
      under the Immigration Rules  as  they  stand  this  is  likely  to  be
      correct. There would be no need for the sponsor to leave  the  country
      for the claimant to make a fresh application and if this was  done  it
      would not jeopardise his employment or status in this country although
      I accept that  there  would  be  delay,  an  extended  separation  and
      additional expense. The alternative, although I  accept  this  is  not
      likely to be their first choice, would be for the sponsor to join  the
      claimant and live with her in Sierra  Leone.  As  matters  stand  this
      would have the advantage that the claimant and the  sponsor  would  be
      able to live with their son. I find  that,  if  they  decided  not  to
      pursue a fresh application, it would be reasonable to expect  them  to
      live together in Sierra Leone.


  17. I find that on the balance of probabilities the  ECO  has  established
      that it would be a  proportionate  interference  with  the  claimant's
      right to respect for her private and  family  life  and  that  of  her
      husband and son to refuse her entry clearance for settlement under the
      current application.


  18. The FTTJ dismissed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules.  I  uphold
      that decision. Having set aside her decision to allow  the  appeal  on
      Article 8 human rights grounds I substitute my  decision  and  dismiss
      the appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds.


  19. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and  can  see  no
      good reason to do so. The appeal is dismissed.
