For the Appellants:    Miss S Akinbolu, Counsel, instructed by Burney Legal
Services
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of  Mrs  Ummul  Khair  Shahina  Khan  and  her  five
    dependants. The first Appellant was born on 6th  June  1964  and  is  a
    citizen of India.  She  applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant which was  refused  in  a  decision  dated  17th
    October 2014. The remaining five  appellants  are  her  dependants.  We
    shall therefore refer just to the  first  Appellant  as  the  Appellant
    throughout this decision.

2.   The Appellant's appeal against  the  refusal  of  leave  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Coll
    on 14th June 2015.   The  judge  did  not  accept  that  the  Appellant
    satisfied  the  requirements  of  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iv)(1)  or    41-
    SD(e)(iv)(2) and she dismissed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules.



3.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pooler
    on 15th September 2015 on the basis that it was arguable that the judge
    should have considered the contracts by reference to the Upper Tribunal
    decision in Shebl (Entrepreneur - proof of contracts) [2014] UKUT 00216
    (IAC). It was also arguable that the judge failed to  consider  whether
    the  Respondent  should  have  exercised  her  discretion  to  ask  for
    documents in relation to advertising.

4.   Permission was refused on the ground that the Appellant was  unable  to
    provide a letter from her bank. The Appellant has not  challenged  this
    point because it relates  to  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iv)(2)  which  is  an
    alternative to paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv)(1). The Respondent was  satisfied
    that the Appellant had �50,000.   The  question  was  whether  she  was
    required to show further funds in the sum of �200,000 because  she  was
    unable to show that her business was trading.

5.   Essentially the issue on appeal is whether the Appellant can show  that
    her  business  was  trading  and  that  she  had  provided   sufficient
    documentation of contracts for services.

Submissions

6.   Miss Akinbolu relied on a skeleton argument  dated  6th  October  2015.
    She submitted a relevant copy of the Immigration  Rules  paragraphs  41
    and 41-SD and a copy of the case of  Shebl.   Miss  Akinbolu  submitted
    that the judge had repeated the errors made by the Secretary  of  State
    in refusing the application on 17th October 2014.

7.   In this particular case two types of contract had been  provided.   The
    Appellant  had  provided  a  franchise  contract  (page  E45   of   the
    Appellant's bundle) which was  between  First-Class  Learning  and  the
    Appellant. The original was supplied and this in itself amounted  to  a
    contract for services sufficient to satisfy the Immigration Rules. Both
    the Respondent and the judge had made an error in finding that this was
    not a contract for services and therefore could not be relied upon.

8.   Secondly, the Appellant provided study agreements  and  invoices  which
    also amounted to a contract for services. There were original copies of
    the study agreements, invoices and the enquiry forms.  Taken as a whole
    this  amounted  to  an  offer,  acceptance  and   consideration   which
    constituted all the elements of a  contract.   The  documents  did  not
    state duration because  they  were  in  fact  rolling  contracts  which
    provided for monthly payments and one month's notice to terminate.   So
    the specific requirements of 41-SD were met because it was  clear  from
    looking at the documents as a whole that the Appellant's name  appeared
    and the duration of the contract was in effect renewable on  a  monthly
    basis.

9.   The judge had erred in law  in  concluding  at  [21]  page  10  of  the
    decision that she could not infer from these documents the existence of
    a contract.  The fact that each of the individual documents  would  not
    satisfy the specified  requirements  in  the  Rules  was  not  relevant
    because  looking  at  the  documents  as  a   whole   those   specified
    requirements were in fact met.

10.  The judge also erred in falling to consider or  make  findings  on  the
    advertising material.  Had she done so she would  have  concluded  that
    the requirements were satisfied.  The judge erred in effect in  stating
    at [23] that

         "The oral evidence produced today by the first Appellant about  the
         documentation submitted with her application would  amount  to  new
         material in that it would be a  different  way  of  presenting  the
         original application.  It  follows  that  I  could  not  allow  the
         Appellant to give oral evidence in her PBS claim today."

11.  The judge also erred in failing to take into  account  the  Appellant's
    explanation set out in her  statement  and  the  documents  which  were
    before her.

12.  Miss  Akinbolu  accepted  that  the  invoices  at  E18  -  E22  of  the
    Appellant's bundle were not before the Respondent. What was before  the
    Respondent  was  advertising  material  and   flyers.    However,   the
    Respondent was not satisfied that these predated 11th July 2014 because
    no date appeared on the flyers and the earliest evidence of advertising
    was on the Morden Library website  where  courses  were  advertised  as
    starting from 12th July 2014.

13.  It should therefore have been obvious to the Respondent that there  was
    other information predating that which  was  before  her  and  had  she
    wanted to clarify  when  the  flyers  were  sent  out  she  could  have
    requested such information from the Appellant.   Had she  done  so  she
    would have received the invoices which appeared at pages E18-E22 of the
    bundle. It was obvious from those invoices that the flyers and business
    cards and other advertising material which were before  the  Respondent
    had in fact been in existence prior to 11th July 2014.

14.  There  was  also  evidence  before  the  judge  of  emails  with  First
    Learning, about the franchise contracts which dated as early as January
    2014 and emails with the print companies in relation to the flyers, the
    business cards and the owner  of  the  website.  There  was  sufficient
    history available, had the Secretary  of  State  asked,  to  show  that
    Appellant had been trading and had advertising material prior  to  11th
    July 2014.  The Appellant therefore met the requirements of  the  Rules
    and the judge erred in law in dismissing her appeal.

15.  Mr Walker stated that it was unfortunate that there was  no  Presenting
    Officer before the First-tier Tribunal because  the  originals  of  the
    flyers and leaflets were in the bundle and the invoices that  had  been
    submitted on appeal corresponded with those  flyers.  There  were  also
    copies of standing orders and cheques which were before the  Respondent
    and the originals of the study agreements. Mr Walker accepted that  the
    judge had made an error in her assessment of the evidence.

Relevant law and Immigration Rules

16.  Paragraph 41-SD(e) provides:

         '(iv)    one or more of the  following  documents  showing  trading
             which  must  cover  (either  together   or   individually)   a
             continuous period commencing before 11  July  2014  up  to  no
             earlier than three months before the date of his application:

             (l)  one or more contracts for service. If a contract  is  not
                  an original the applicant  must  sign  each  page  of  the
                  contract. Each contract must show:

                  (a)  the applicant's name and the name of the business

                  (b)  the service provided by the applicant's business; and



                  (c)  the name of the other party or  parties  involved  in
                      the contract and  their  contact  details,  including
                      their  full  address,  postal  code,  landline  phone
                      number and any email address; and

             (2)  one or more original letters from UK-regulated  financial
                  institutions  which  the  applicant  as  a  business  bank
                  account, on the institution's headed paper, confirming the
                  date the business was trading during the  period  referred
                  to at (iv) above.'

17.  In Shebl (Entrepreneur:  proof  of  contracts)  [2014]  UKUT  216,  the
    Tribunal held

         "5.  The Secretary of State's  position  is  that  the  Immigration
             Rules envisage a contract included in a single  document,  and
             that a series of documents that  together  show  all  material
             required by the Rules does not constitute "a contract". We can
             see no proper basis for that assertion. The  intention  behind
             the Rules is that the claimant be able  to  show  that  he  is
             genuinely trading. It strikes us  as  inconceivable  that  the
             entrepreneur route was to be confined to the types of  trading
             in which contracts are made by single documents. Paragraph 41-
             SD very properly specifies  that  there  must  be  documentary
             evidence sufficient to show genuine contracts, and  containing
             sufficient information to enable the  Secretary  of  State  to
             check the matter with the other parties for the  contracts  if
             she chooses to do so. But  there  is  a  world  of  difference
             between requiring contracts to be evidenced by a proper  paper
             trail and requiring each contract to be contained in a  single
             document. In our judgment the Rules require  the  former,  but
             not the latter."

18.  In order to meet the requirements of Table 4,  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)
    in its relevant parts, requires the appellant to provide:

         '(iii)   one or more of the following specified documents  covering
             (either  together  or  individually)   a   continuous   period
             commencing before 11 July 2014 up to  no  earlier  than  three
             months before the date of his application:

             (l)  Advertising or marketing material, including printouts of
                  online advertising that  has  been  published  locally  or
                  nationally, showing the applicant's name (and the names of
                  the business if applicable)  together  with  the  business
                  activity  or,  where  his  business  is  trading   online,
                  confirmation of his ownership of the domain  name  of  the
                  business's website.'

19.  Paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules provides:

         '(a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part  6A  state
             that specified documents must be provided, the Entry Clearance
             Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary  of  State  will
             only consider documents that  have  been  submitted  with  the
             application, and will only consider documents submitted  after
             the application where they are submitted  in  accordance  with
             subparagraph (b).

         (b)  If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:

             (i)  Some of the documents in a  sequence  have  been  omitted
                  (for example, if one  bank  statement  from  a  series  is
                  missing);

             (ii) A document is in the wrong  format  (for  example,  if  a
                  letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or

             (iii)    A document is a copy and not an original document; or



             (iv)  A  document  does  not  contain  all  of  the  specified
                  information;

             the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Immigration  Officer  or  the
             Secretary  of  State  may  contact  the   applicant   or   his
             representative in writing, and request the correct  documents.
             The requested  documents  must  be  received  at  the  address
             specified in the request within 7 working days of the date  of
             the request.

         (c)  Documents will not be requested where a specified document has
             not  been  submitted  (for   example   an   English   language
             certificate is missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer,
             Immigration  Officer  or  the  Secretary  of  State  does  not
             anticipate that addressing the omission or error  referred  to
             in  subparagraph  (b)  will  lead  to  a  grant  because   the
             application will be refused for other reasons.

         (d)  If the applicant has submitted a specified document:

             (i)  in the wrong format; or

             (ii) which is a copy and not an original document; or

             (iii)     which  does  not  contain  all  of   the   specified
                  information, but the  missing  information  is  verifiable
                  from:

                  (1)  other documents submitted with the application,

                  (2)  the website of  the  organisation  which  issued  the
             document, or

                  (3)  the website of the appropriate regulatory body;

             the application may be granted  exceptionally,  providing  the
             Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the  Secretary
             of State is satisfied that the specified documents are genuine
             and the applicant meets all the other requirements. The  Entry
             Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer  or  the  Secretary  of
             State reserves the right to  request  the  specified  original
             documents in  the  correct  format  in  all  cases  where  (b)
             applies, and to refuse applications if these documents are not
             provided as set out in (b).'

Discussion and Conclusion

20.  We are of the view that the judge has erred in  law  in  two  respects.
    Firstly, in finding at [21] page 10 of the decision that she could  not
    infer the existence of a  contract  for  services  from  the  franchise
    contract,  study  agreements,  standing  orders  and  other   documents
    relating to the provision of services. We are  of  the  view  that  the
    judge failed to properly direct herself in accordance  with  Shebl  and
    also in accordance with the  Immigration  Rules  which  provide  for  a
    contract for services to be evidenced by more than one document.

21.  In Shebl the Tribunal held that the requirement to prove the  existence
    of contracts in paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A to the Immigration  Rules
    does not itself require the contracts in question to  be  contained  in
    documents.  There  is  a  need,  however,  for  such  contracts  to  be
    evidenced in documentary form.

22.  Looking at the whole of the documentation which has  been  pointed  out
    by Miss Akinbolu today, such evidence was before the  Respondent,  when
    she made her decision, and before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.  That
    evidence was sufficient to satisfy the Immigration Rules.  It was clear
    from the evidence that the  Appellant  was  trading  and  was  and  had
    supplied  sufficient  documentation  of  a   contract   for   services.
    Accordingly, we find that paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv)(1) of the  Immigration
    Rules is satisfied.

23.  The second point relates to advertising.  We find that the  judge  made
    an error of law in failing to take into account  the  Appellant's  oral
    evidence and her statement.  Section 85A of the 2002 Act did not render
    this  evidence  inadmissible.  Ahmed  and  Others  (PBS  -   admissible
    evidence) [2014] UKUT 365 (IAC) did not prevent the judge  from  taking
    into account the Appellant's statement and oral evidence.

24.  In looking at whether the decision maker had made the correct  decision
    on the evidence before her the judge  is  entitled  to  hear  from  the
    Appellant on that point.  Had she done so the  judge  would  have  been
    aware that the advertising material before the Respondent was such that
    there were a number of original  flyers  and  copies  from  the  Morden
    Library website.

25.  The Morden Library website although printed  out  on  4th  August  2014
    related to courses from 12th July 2014 onwards. The flyers at E2  -  17
    of the Appellant's bundle were not dated and therefore could be said to
    satisfy paragraph 245AA(4) which provides that "if  the  Appellant  has
    submitted specified documents in which a document does not contain  all
    the specified information  the  Secretary  of  State  may  contact  the
    Appellant or his representative and request the correct documents".

26.  Miss Akinbolu submitted that it is clear from the  evidence  which  was
    before  the  Respondent  that  the  flyers   were   missing   specified
    information, namely the date, but given the Morden  Library  event  and
    the activities advertised therein, that maths tuition from First  Class
    Learning provided by the Appellant was available from 12th  July  2014,
    the flyers were likely  to  have  predated  that.  Had  the  Respondent
    contacted the Appellant she would  have  provided  the  invoices  which
    appear at E18 - E22 of the bundle showing  that  the  flyers,  business
    cards, banners, wall sign, posters and letterheads  were  all  provided
    before 11th July 2014.

27.  On the evidence which was before the judge the Appellant satisfied  the
    Immigration Rules. We find that the judge  made  an  error  of  law  in
    failing to taking into account the Appellant's  evidence  and  also  in
    finding that the Respondent had properly exercised her discretion under
    paragraph 245AA.  We find that the  missing  material  was  covered  by
    paragraph 245AA(b)(iv) and  that  had  the  Respondent  requested  such
    material it could have been provided and  the  application  could  have
    been allowed.

28.  Therefore, the judge had erred in law at [23] - [25]  in  finding  that
    the Respondent had considered the evidential flexibility  policy  under
    paragraph 245AA and was not obliged to exercise it in  the  Appellant's
    favour.

29.  Accordingly, we set aside  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  decision
    dated 14th June 2014 and remake it. We  find  that  the  Appellant  has
    satisfied paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv)(i) of the Immigration Rules  and  that
    she had provided sufficient advertising material to  satisfy  paragraph
    41-SD(e)(iii) of  the  Immigration  Rules.   It  was  clear  from  this
    evidence that the Appellant was actively trading.  She  therefore  only
    needed to show access to �50,000 which was accepted by the  Respondent.
    The Appellant satisfied the requirements of Appendix A and was entitled
    to the points in relation to access to funds.

30.   We  allow  the  Appellant's  appeal  and  set  aside  the   First-tier
    Tribunal's decision and remake  it,  allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision
