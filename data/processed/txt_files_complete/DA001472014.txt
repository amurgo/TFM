Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss S Lloyd, Counsel, instructed by Rodman Pearce
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Cyprus born on 9 July 1982.  He has  been
    granted permission to appeal the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (comprising First-tier Tribunal Judge Cooper and Miss V  S  Street  JP)
    dismissing his appeal against the decision of the respondent  dated  17
    January 2014 to deport him from the UK under Regulation 19(3)(b) of the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

2.   The  appellant  was  convicted  of  inflicting  grievous  bodily  harm,
    contrary to Section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, for
    which on 25 January 2013 he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.
     Prior to this  offence  the  appellant  had  on  9  December  2009  at
    Southwark Crown Court been convicted of two counts  of  sexual  assault
    and sentenced to eight months' imprisonment for each count, concurrent,
    suspended for two  years,  and  required  to  sign  the  Sex  Offenders
    Register for five years.  The respondent considered the  index  offence
    of which he had been convicted  and  his  conduct  in  accordance  with
    Regulation  21  of  the  2006  EEA  Regulations.   The  respondent  was
    satisfied that the appellant posed a genuine, present and  sufficiently
    serious threat to the interests of public  policy  if  he  were  to  be
    allowed to remain in the United Kingdom and that  his  deportation  was
    justified under Regulation 21.

3.   A further reason for the deportation was that  there  was  no  evidence
    from the appellant to show that he had resided here  for  a  continuous
    period of five years or ten years. He had therefore  not  acquired  the
    right of permanent residence under  the  Regulations,  and  so  he  was
    liable to be deported on grounds of public policy or public security.

4.   The appellant's evidence to the First-tier Tribunal  was  that  he  had
    moved to the United Kingdom from Cyprus in 2005  and  had  resided  and
    worked here since without being absent.  For the previous five years he
    had a partner called  Andria  Angleas.  Although  they  shared  a  home
    together, he gave a different as address for her.  He said he  was  the
    father of a child called Toby Marr by  a  British  woman  called  Tracy
    Marr.  He was unable to provide the child's date of  birth  and  stated
    that he had not seen the child for a  while.  He  had  lived  with  the
    child's mother for two and a half to three years.

5.   He said that the judge did not remark that he  was  a  violent  person.
    He was no danger to the  public,  as  he  was  acting  in  self-defence
    because the victim had tried to stab him with a weapon,  a  knife.   It
    was only one punch to defend himself.  He regretted  the  incident  and
    wished he could turn the clock back.

6.   The First-tier Tribunal considered that if, as  the  appellant  claims,
    he has been continuously resident in the United Kingdom since 2005,  at
    first sight it might appear that he had acquired a right  of  permanent
    residence.  However Regulation  6  defines  a  qualified  person.   The
    categories under which the appellant might  claim  to  be  a  qualified
    person would be as a job seeker or as a worker.

7.   The First-tier Tribunal held that on  his  own  account  the  appellant
    worked for about a year as a painter and decorator  after  arriving  in
    2005, but did not then work until the year before  he  was  imprisoned,
    when he claims to have worked as a car sprayer and  panel  beater.   No
    documentary evidence of either of these employments had been  produced,
    although there was a letter at AB10 from Wendy Indge stating  that  she
    and her husband employed him maintaining rental properties in the Essex
    area from 2007 until the recession obliged them to "lose" him.

8.   The Tribunal found that the only formal indicator of his  work  pattern
    was the letter from HMRC  at  AB11  recording  his  national  insurance
    history.  That discloses that he has never in fact  paid  any  National
    Insurance Contributions and that for all or  part  of  the  years  from
    2006/7 to 2012/13 he was in receipt  of  Job  Seekers  Allowance.   The
    Tribunal acknowledged that in 2007/8 and 2010/11  he  did  do  approved
    training.

9.   The Tribunal considered that Regulation 6, in its current and  previous
    form (it was amended with  effect  from  1  January  2014)  effectively
    provides that a person will not cease to be considered as a  worker  if
    he has been unemployed for no more  than  six  months  or  can  provide
    evidence that he is seeking employment in the United Kingdom and has  a
    genuine chance of being engaged.  The same criterion applies to  a  job
    seeker, namely  that  he  can  provide  evidence  that  he  is  seeking
    employment in the United Kingdom and has  a  genuine  chance  of  being
    engaged. The Tribunal held that  it  was  clear  from  the  appellant's
    national insurance history that he was effectively unemployed  for  the
    whole of the years 2008/9 and 2009/10, in which he was given 53 and  51
    credits respectively for  National  Insurance  Contributions.   In  any
    event, the appellant produced no documentary evidence to prove  he  was
    in fact employed prior to being sent to prison.  This led the  Tribunal
    to conclude that, at least during the  years  2008/9  and  2009/10  the
    appellant was unemployed.

10.  The Tribunal said that the Regulations  draw  an  implicit  distinction
    between being registered as a  job  seeker  and  evidence  of  actually
    seeking employment  with  a  genuine  chance  of  being  engaged;  both
    requirements have to be proved. The appellant had not produced evidence
    to them that he was seeking employment and  had  a  genuine  chance  of
    being engaged for the whole of that two year period.  Consequently  the
    Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had remained either as  a
    worker or a job seeker, as defined  by  Regulation  6.   They  did  not
    accept that he had met the test of spending a continuous period of five
    years here as a qualified person.  Accordingly  the  Tribunal  was  not
    satisfied  that  the  appellant  had  acquired  a  permanent  right  of
    residence under the Regulations.

11.  The Tribunal held that a consequence of this finding is that  only  the
    lowest of the three standards justifying deportation  under  Regulation
    21 has to be met, that is the decision to remove the appellant from the
    UK has to be taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
    pubic health; the higher standards of serious grounds of public  policy
    or public security or imperative grounds of  public  security,  do  not
    have to be met in this case.

12.  In their consideration of the criteria set out in  Regulation  21,  the
    most significant of which is that the personal conduct  of  the  person
    concerned must represent a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.

13.  The Tribunal found that there was  no  doubt  at  all  that  the  index
    offence  was  a  violent  and  unprovoked  attack  on   a   defenceless
    individual.  The Tribunal considered the two OASys Reports dated 5 June
    2013 and 11 December 2013.  They also noted  that  the  NOMS  1  report
    referred to an OASys Report completed on 26 Novembver 2013  which  they
    assumed was the latter of the two OASys Reports.  They noted  that  the
    first OASys Report had assessed the appellant as  presenting  a  medium
    risk of harm to those in the community, but the second one assessed him
    as presenting a higher risk of serious harm to the  public.   This  was
    reflected in the NOMS  1,  which  refers  to  the  later  OASys  Report
    assessing the risk of reconviction for violent type of offending as low
    but assessing the risk of serious harm to others as high, "based on the
    high levels of minimisation, denial and blame".  The Tribunal noted the
    decision recorded on 17 October 2013 as to whether to recategorise  the
    appellant when he was in prison at HMP Huntercombe, the material  parts
    of which read:

         "A recategorisation board has taken place and it has  been  decided
         that you should remain in category C conditions for  the  following
         reasons:


         (1)  At the point of sentence you were assessed as posing a  medium
             risk  of  harm.   However  your  offender  manager   currently
             assesses you as posing a high risk of harm towards the public.
              This is due to the nature of your offending, the minimisation
             of your  offending  and  the  lack  of  offence  focused  work
             undertaken.


         (2)  You have demonstrated previous non-compliance with  the  terms
             of an order which heightens the risk  of  non-compliance  with
             open conditions."

14.  The Tribunal said they were particularly struck by the  letter  written
    by the appellant in which he continued to assert that he had  assaulted
    his victim in self defence.  The Tribunal  considered  that  in  cross-
    examination the appellant did not unequivocally abandon his claim  that
    he was acting in self defence.

15.  In assessing whether the appellant presented a current serious  threat,
    the Tribunal took into account his convictions for sexual  offences  in
    2009.  They noted that these did not  result  in  custodial  sentences,
    albeit they were suspended and with the  appellant  being  required  to
    sign the Sex Offenders Register.  They noted that it was also  recorded
    that on 17 February 2011 he was convicted of failing to comply with the
    notification requirements under that order. Whilst the sexual  offences
    were not violent physical assaults,  they  were  nevertheless  assaults
    which demonstrated a lack of respect for a women's personal  integrity,
    and failing to comply with the notification in  itself  demonstrated  a
    lack of respect for authority.   The  Tribunal  acknowledged  that  the
    appellant has obtained a certificate of completion from the Forgiveness
    Project following attendance on a short course in the summer  of  2013,
    but did not believe that he no  longer  presented  a  serious  risk  of
    violence to members of the public.

16.  The Tribunal also considered the other factors under  Regulation  21(6)
    but found that none of them  carried  any  significant  weight  in  the
    appellant's favour.  He is a relatively  young  man  in  apparent  good
    health.  The Tribunal was not satisfied  that  the  appellant  has  any
    significant family connections in this country.  His economic situation
    has been one of nearly continuous dependency upon  the  state  for  his
    maintenance since his arrival in the UK.  Although he may have been  in
    this country since 2005, he has some friends, for example,  Miss  Chase
    and Miss Indge, but there was no compelling evidence of his social  and
    cultural integration into the United Kingdom.  On his  own  account  he
    has a family in Cyprus to whom he could turn.

17.  The Tribunal concluded that the personal conduct of the appellant  does
    present a genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat,  affecting
    one of the fundamental interests of society, namely the interest in the
    public being able to walk the streets in safety.

18.  Permission was granted to the appellant to argue the three  grounds  of
    appeal drafted by Miss Lloyd of Counsel.

19.  The appeal first came  before  me  on  14  November  2014.   It  became
    apparent  that  the  details  of  the  appellant's  National  insurance
    contributions (NICs) record relied on by the Tribunal required  further
    explanation.  On account of this I adjourned the hearing in order  that
    further submissions could be made in relation to the law on Jobseeker's
    Allowance (JSA). Following the adjournment Miss Lloyd submitted written
    submissions dated 21 November 2014 and the HOPO, Mr Shilliday submitted
    his response dated 7 December 2014.  A witness statement from  Severine
    Ameur from Rodman Pierce Solicitors dated 8 December 2014 was submitted
    by the appellant's solicitors.

20.  Miss Lloyd argued that the appellant is entitled to be considered as  a
    permanent resident in accordance with Regulation 15(1)(a) of  the  2006
    EEA Regulations because he was  a qualified person for the  purpose  of
    Regulation 6(1) for over five years; firstly, as a worker in accordance
    with Regulation 6(1)(b) in 2005, as he was engaged  as  a  painter  and
    decorator; and  subsequently  as  a  job  seeker,  in  accordance  with
    Regulation 6(1)(a), as he was in receipt of Job Seekers Allowance  from
    the tax year 2006/7 to the tax  year  2013/13.   She  argued  that  the
    Tribunal erred in law in  concluding  that  the  appellant  was  not  a
    permanent resident because he had not produced  evidence  that  he  was
    seeking employment in the tax years 2008/9 to 2009/10 and had a genuine
    chance of being engaged for the whole of that  two  year  period.   She
    relied on the case of A and Others v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  1272  (Admin)
    where it was held that it was too late for  the  Home  Office  and  the
    First-tier Tribunal to contend that the claimant was  not  resident  in
    the UK in accordance with  the  EEA  Regulations  when  the  state  had
    treated her as being resident in accordance with the  EEA  Regulations,
    since she had been permitted child tax credits and had been  housed  by
    the local housing authority as a social tenant.

21.  Relying on this case, Miss Lloyd argued  that  as  there  was  evidence
    that the appellant has been granted Job Seekers Allowance by one arm of
    the state, it would be wrong for the respondent, and the courts, to  go
    behind that award and require evidence in order  to  determine  whether
    the appellant is a qualified person for the purpose  of  the  2006  EEA
    Regulations.

22.  She relied on the witness statement from Miss Ameur who had  telephoned
    the HM Revue and Customs on 8 December 2014 and spoken to a caseworker.
     The caseworker explained that the "number of credits"  column  of  the
    letter of 14  February  2014  showed  the  number  of  weeks  that  the
    appellant was in receipt of a certain type of benefit for a  particular
    tax year.  For example,  for  the  tax  year  2006-2007  the  appellant
    received Job Seekers Allowance for 22  weeks  out  of  52  weeks.   The
    caseworker pointed out that the fact that "NICs paid"  column  for  tax
    year  2006-2007  showed  no  contribution  should   not   strictly   be
    interpreted as  meaning  that  the  appellant  was  not  working.   She
    explained that if the appellant was working but earned  less  than  the
    primary threshold (�153 per week for 2014-2015) he would not have  paid
    any national insurance.  The appellant would  have  national  insurance
    contributions added to his record as long as he earned at least as much
    as the lower earnings limit (�111 per week for 2014-2015).

23.  Miss Lloyd relied on an extract from  MacDonald's  paragraph  7.126  in
    relation to how the Job Seekers Allowance is assessed  in  terms  of  a
    person from abroad unless they come within the exceptions, prior to the
    amendment in 2014.  She submitted that the assessment has  not  changed
    in any substantive way. I note that this was the finding  made  by  the
    Tribunal.  Mss Lloyd submitted that the appellant is either a worker in
    accordance  with  Regulation  85A(4)  of   the   Jobseekers   Allowance
    Regulations or as a worker in accordance with Article 7(3)(b), (c)  and
    (d) of Council Directive No. 2004/38/EC.   He  retains  the  status  of
    worker under  Article  7(3)(b)  if  he  is  duly  recorded  involuntary
    employment after having been  employed for more than  a  year  and  has
    registered as a job  seeker  with  a  relevant  employment  office;  or
    subsection (c) if he is duly recorded  involuntary  unemployment  after
    completion a fixed term of employment contract of less than a  year  or
    after having become involuntarily unemployed during  the  first  twelve
    months and has registered as a job seeker with the relevant  employment
    officer. In either of these circumstances the status of a worker  shall
    be retained for no more than  six  months.   Ms  Lloyd  submitted  that
    subsection (b) or (c) may apply to  the  appellant  and  therefore  the
    appellant continues to be a qualifying person.

24.  Mr Tarlow relied on the respondent's response dated  10  October  2004,
    and the response submitted by Mr Shilliday.  He asked me to  reject  Ms
    Lloyd's arguments as it is not clear on what evidence  the  DWP  handed
    out the Job Seekers Allowance to the appellant.  For  the  purposes  of
    the Regulations the appellant needs to provide  evidence  that  he  has
    been in the UK in accordance with the Regulations.  He  submitted  that
    the Tribunal at paragraph 47 said that there was a distinction  between
    being registered as a job  seeker  and  evidence  of  actually  seeking
    employment with a genuine chance of being  engaged.  According  to  the
    case of Antonissen [1991] ECR 1-745, Case C-344/95, the ECJ noted  that
    there must be a "reasonable period" for job seekers to  find  work  and
    gave six months as an example.  Mr Tarlow submitted  that  there  is  a
    world of difference between six months and five years.

25.  I find that the Tribunal did not err in  law.   The  appellant  has  to
    establish that he has spent a continuous period of five years in the UK
    as a qualified person under the 2006  EEA  Regulations;  in  this  case
    either as a worker or jobseeker.

26.  The five year period the Tribunal was looking at  was  from  2006/7  to
    2012/13.  The evidence from HMRC  showed  that  the  appellant  was  in
    receipt of Job Seekers Allowance for all of those years  although  they
    acknowledged that in 2007/8 and 2010/11 he did approved  training.  The
    Tribunal found that for all or part of those six years, he did not  pay
    any  national  insurance  contributions.    I   have   considered   the
    explanation from the caseworker at HMRC.  I find that the  explanations
    do not assist the appellant.  There was no  evidence  as  to  what  the
    primary threshold was in the two-year period  2008/9  and  2009/10  and
    there was no evidence that the appellant worked in  that  period.   The
    fact is he received Job Seekers Allowance for the two- year period  and
    paid no national insurance contributions at all as he was credited with
    53 and 51 NICs credits.  In the absence of evidence from the  appellant
    or the HMRC clarifying what the position was in that  two-year  period,
    and in the absence of evidence that he was actually seeking  employment
    with a genuine chance of being engaged,  I  find  that  the  Tribunal's
    decision that the  appellant  had  not  met  the  test  of  spending  a
    continuous period of five years here as a qualified  person  under  the
    2006 EEA Regulations, disclosed no error of law.

27.  Accordingly, I reject Ms Lloyd's argument that the Tribunal should  not
    go behind the treatment by  the  DWP  in  granting  the  appellant  Job
    Seekers Allowance because that was evidence that the appellant had been
    accepted as a worker with retained rights and  therefore  was  eligible
    for Job Seekers Allowance.  I find that there was no evidence from  the
    appellant to establish that he meets the requirements Article  7(3)  of
    Directive  No.  2004/38/EC.   I  find  that  the  two  year  period  of
    unemployment from 2008/9 to 2010/11 was fatal to his application as  it
    has not been shown as in  the  case  of  Antonissen  that  this  was  a
    reasonable period in which it could be said he was seeking employment.

28.  Miss Lloyd relied on her second ground which argued that  the  Tribunal
    failed to take into account the relevant consideration in  relation  to
    risk. She relied on  Essa  (Rehabilitation/reintegration)  [2013]  UKUT
    00316 where the Upper  Tribunal  clarified  the  test  as  set  out  in
    Regulation 21(5).  The Upper Tribunal held that in any  deportation  of
    an EEA national, the claimant must represent a present threat to public
    policy.  The fact of a criminal conviction is  not  enough.  They  must
    represent a present threat by reason of  propensity  to  offend  or  an
    unacceptably high risk of reoffending.  Miss Lloyd  submitted  that  in
    assessing the appellant as being a  high risk of serious  harm  to  the
    public, the Tribunal failed to take into  account  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had been assessed by the Offender Manager  as  being  at  low
    risk of violent type offending and medium risk of non-violent  type  of
    offending.  That was a material omission.  Further, the appellant  gave
    evidence that he was on conditional bail from the Criminal Court for  a
    period of approximately eight months, during  which  time  he  was  not
    accused of committing any further offences.  This factor was not  taken
    into account in the assessment of the  likelihood  of  the  appellant's
    reoffending and the risk that he posed to the public.

29.   I  find  that  the  Tribunal's  failure  to  take  into  account   the
    conclusions drawn by the Offender Manager does not materially undermine
    their decision.  The Tribunal considered the two OASys Reports and  the
    NOMS 1 Report and the decision whether to re-categorise  the  appellant
    when he was in prison at HMP Huntercombe.  The Tribunal noted that  the
    NOMS 1 Report which referred to the later  OASys  Report  assessed  the
    appellant's risk of reconviction for  violent  type  offending  as  low
    which I find reflected the Offender Manager's assessment.

30.  I also find that the Tribunal's failure to take into account  that  the
    appellant did not offend for eight months while he was  on  conditional
    bail discloses no arguable error of law.  The fact is the appellant was
    thereafter given a three year custodial sentence  for  the  offence  of
    GBH.

31.  Finally, I reject Ms Lloyd's third argument that  the  Tribunal  failed
    to give reasons for their assessment of risk of  reoffending.   I  find
    that the Tribunal did give reasons at paragraph 53.

32.  I find that  the  Tribunal  did  not  err  in  law  in  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal. The Tribunal's decision shall stand.

Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun
