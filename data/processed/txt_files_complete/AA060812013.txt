                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Derrick Pears), sitting at Hatton Cross on 25 July,  to
    an asylum and human rights  appeal by  someone  who  claimed  to  be  a
    citizen of Afghanistan,  born  in  1994.   The  appellant  arrived  and
    claimed asylum on 3 November 2008: his claim was refused  on  13  March
    2009; but, because of his age, he  was  given  discretionary  leave  to
    remain till 1 July 2010. Before then, he applied for further  leave  to
    remain, which was eventually refused on 10 December 2010.  However,  as
    the result of a  first-tier  appeal  decision,  the  Home  Office  were
    required on 30 November 2011 to reconsider theirs; but they did not  do
    so, refusing it again, till 18 June 2013, a further delay  of  over  18
    months.

 2. The decision-maker noted at paragraph 13 that the  appellant's  brother
    Fazal had arrived in 2006: his case followed a similar  pattern  up  to
    his making an in-time application for further leave  to  remain  on  22
    January 2010; but, as  the  decision-maker  records  it,  he  was  "...
    granted  ILR  outside  of  the  rules  on  19/01/2011  because   of   a
    'substantial delay' in his case". This delay had of course been one  of
    less than 12 months. At paragraph 72 the decision-maker said this

       ... the circumstances that gave  rise  to  your  brother's  grant  of
       indefinite  leave  to  remain  were  not  based  on   your   familial
       connection. Consequently, you do not qualify for discretionary  leave
       for the same reasons that he did.

    Evidently the writer had forgotten why he himself had  said  Fazal  had
    been granted indefinite leave to remain, as there  was  no  attempt  to
    deal with the  delay  in  this  appellant's  case,  or  the  consequent
    disparity in outcome.

 3. Nor was the disparity point taken  by  the  advocate  in  her  skeleton
    argument or before the hearing judge in this case; but it was taken  by
    another member of the  firm  in  his  grounds  of  appeal:  though  the
    permission judge did not grant permission on it, she did not refuse  it
    either. It clearly arises on the  face  of  the  Home  Office  decision
    itself, though only if one's attention is drawn, as mine  was,  to  the
    mismatch between paragraphs 13 and 72. In my judgment it raises a clear
    point of Human Rights Convention law on the application of  article  8,
    and requires the decision to be re-made.

 4. Miss Cronin made it clear that, if I reached that result, she would not
    seek to re-open the appellant's asylum claim, but only his  case  under
    article 8, and without calling any further oral evidence: the judge did
    not reject any aspect of the appellant's case on his  circumstances  in
    this country. Dealing with one point, not taken in the  grounds,  which
    she sought to argue, the judge did not accept that the appellant was  a
    citizen of Afghanistan; but Mr Deller for his part agrees that this  is
    implicit in the Home Office recognition of him as Fazal's brother.

 5. Miss Cronin accepted that this appellant could not qualify for  further
    leave to remain under the terms of the 'new Rules' now in force on  the
    application of article 8. Though this is not a deportation  case,  both
    sides also accept that, in line with MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192
    at paragraph 43, 'exceptional circumstances' must be required  for  the
    appellant nevertheless to qualify for further leave. These include (see
    paragraph 44) the application of the usual proportionality test.

FAMILY LIFE

 6. So far as the appellant's enjoyment of family life in this  country  is
    concerned, Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) Nepal  [2012]
    UKUT 160 (IAC) makes it clear in the judicial head-note,  though  in  a
    different factual context, that

       ... there is no general proposition that Article 8  of  the  European
       Convention on Human Rights can never be engaged when the family  life
       it is sought to establish is between adult siblings living  together.
       Rather than applying a blanket rule with regard  to  adult  children,
       each case should be analysed on its own facts, to decide  whether  or
       not family life exists, within the meaning of Article  8(1).   Whilst
       some generalisations are possible, each case is fact-sensitive.

 7. In this case, the appellant was, according to the statutory terminology
    under the Children Act 1989, set out by Miss Cronin, a 'child in  need'
    on his arrival here; when he was placed in foster care by  Kent  County
    Council, he became a 'looked after child', till  he  was  16,  when  he
    became 'an eligible child' whom they were looking after. That means  he
    is now a 'former relevant child', who, the Act  assumes,  will  have  a
    continuing need for care, at least by way of  'personal  mentoring  and
    guidance' till he reaches 21 (or 25, if further education  or  training
    were part of the plan). This does not of course  mean  that  he  has  a
    right to family life with the local authority, and neither is it in any
    way exceptional, in the context of unaccompanied  minor  asylum-seekers
    generally; but  it  does  amount  to  statutory  recognition  that  the
    appellant's circumstances give him a  right  to  consideration  of  his
    family life over and above someone who had grown up with the support of
    his parents.

 8. In this appellant's case, the evidence (statement  of  the  appellant's
    cousin Niaz Mohd. Jabarkhail, 12 July 2013) shows that he has no  close
    relations in his home area, and nothing has been heard from his  mother
    or his uncle in Pakistan. In this country, since he came out of  foster
    care, he has been living not with,  but  close  to  his  elder  brother
    Fazal, and his elder cousins Niaz Mohd. and  Sharbat  Khan  Jabarkhail.
    According to  Niaz  Mohd.,  this  situation  arose  because  the  local
    authority social services department were  required  to  carry  out  an
    assessment of whether his house would be overcrowded by the appellant's
    staying there with all of them, as a result of which they placed him in
    foster care, but found somewhere close to his relations for him when he
    came out of that.

 9. Niaz Mohd. however says the appellant comes to their local mosque  with
    them every Friday,  and  also  comes  over  for  football  practice  on
    Saturdays and games on Sundays. He will at least eat a meal  with  them
    every week-end; but local authority restrictions mean  that  a  request
    has to be made for permission for him to stay over, which is not always
    possible. The appellant was  to  return  to  college  for  the  present
    academic year.

10. In my judgment,  all  of  this  in  the  context  of  this  appellant's
    individual history, and in the light of Ghising,  means  that  he  does
    have a family life in this country which  attracts  the  protection  of
    article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.  There  is
    certainly nothing exceptional about it; but it has to be taken  account
    of in the usual balancing exercise, to which I shall now turn.

PROPORTIONALITY

11. Coming first  to  the  considerations  in  favour  of  the  appellant's
    removal, everyone knows that large  numbers  of  young  Afghan  asylum-
    seekers have been allowed discretionary leave to remain till the age of
    17ï¿½, as this appellant and his brother  were,  in  recent  years.  That
    policy  is  followed  in  line  with   this   country's   international
    humanitarian obligations, and there  is  of  course  a  strong  general
    public interest in its not being  allowed  to  become  a  side-door  to
    voluntary migration, both because of the difficulties in  dealing  with
    immigrants already here, and so as not to encourage  others  to  follow
    them in future.





12. As against that, this appellant is still only  19,  and  has  no  close
    relations to turn to in Afghanistan, and no traceable ones in Pakistan.
    He has a close family life with his brothers  and  cousins;  though  he
    does not spend the week with them, owing to the local  authority's  own
    rules, he does join them in the activities  which  no  doubt  they  all
    consider important, mosque on Fridays, and football and meals  together
    at week-ends.

13. In my view, the appellant's family life does not on its  own  make  his
    removal disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of . If it  were  to
    be regarded as doing so, then many  thousands  of  unaccompanied  minor
    former asylum-seekers, from Afghanistan and elsewhere, would  no  doubt
    be in much the same position. It is no doubt to provide some  check  on
    the influx that the 'new  Rules'  have  been  approved  by  Parliament,
    requiring, as held in MF (Nigeria), 'exceptional circumstances'  before
    someone not otherwise qualified under them can be allowed to stay.

14. In my view, the only exceptional circumstances in this case consist  in
    the  disparity  which  resulted  in  the  different  treatment  of  the
    appellant and his brother Fazal. There is  no  material  difference  in
    their cases, except that Fazal was given indefinite leave to remain  as
    the result of under 12 months' delay in  considering  his  application,
    which was pending all that while. In this appellant's case,  the  first
    decision was reached in not unreasonable  time,  after  less  than  six
    months. There was then another year, for which the Home Office can only
    be partly responsible, while the appeal process went on its way.

15. I have not been  provided  with  the  basis  on  which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal allowed this appellant's first appeal; but it does not seem to
    me that it would make much difference. On 30  November  2011  the  Home
    Office were ordered to reconsider their decision  on  his  application;
    but they did not do so till 18 July 2013. Meanwhile the  appellant  has
    settled down to the life he has with  his  brother  and  cousins.  Even
    after that delay of over 18 months, the decision-maker did not make the
    connexion between the relevant periods in  this  appellant's  case  and
    Fazal. Perhaps, as Mr Deller suggested, that was because  there  was  a
    difference in the route the cases took, with an intervening  appeal  in
    this appellant's; but, if so, that was a failure to connect  for  which
    the Home Office are responsible, not him.

16. In my view it was also a failure which brings in what Lord  Bingham  of
    Cornhill said in EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41 at paragraph 16:

       Delay may be relevant, thirdly, in reducing the weight  otherwise  to
       be accorded to the requirements of firm and fair immigration control,
       if the delay is shown to be the  result  of  a  dysfunctional  system
       which yields unpredictable, inconsistent and unfair outcomes.

    That is exactly what  has  happened  in  this  case,  as  between  this
    appellant and his brother: the Home Office accepted their  relationship
    and the delay which had taken place in the  brother's  case;  but  they
    failed to explain why the greater delay in this appellant's should  not
    lead to a similar result.





17. I take the view that this feature of the  case  only  can  properly  be
    regarded as exceptional, in view of the very  particular  circumstances
    involved; and, taking it into account together with  the  rest  of  the
    balancing exercise, I should  regard  it  as  disproportionate  to  the
    legitimate purpose of  now to remove this appellant.
