Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms F Anthony, instructed by French & Co
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Taj Shazad, date  of  birth  1.1.89,  is  a  citizen  of
    Afghanistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge North promulgated  9.7.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 14.11.13 to  refuse  his  application
    for leave to remain in the UK on the basis of human rights family  life
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR,  and  to
    remove him from the UK by way of directions under  section  10  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The Judge heard the appeal on 27.6.14.



 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Tiffen  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    28.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge North should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  summarised  briefly  as
    follows. The appellant entered the UK illegally in either 2009 or 2011.
    He did not come to the  attention  of  the  authorities  until  he  was
    detained on 9.7.13 and served with a notice of  liability  to  removal.
    Only after that date did he make a  claim  for  leave  to  remain.  The
    refusal decision sets out in detail the long  history  of  applications
    and representations, but it transpired from a scan of his  fingerprints
    that he had claimed asylum on three separate occasions in 2010 in three
    different countries: Hungary, Austria, and France. It was then that  he
    changed his claim to have entered the  UK  in  2009  to  2011.  He  was
    granted temporary release on 20.8.13 and information gathered as to his
    claims under  Appendix  FM  and  article  8.  The  appellant  claims  a
    relationship with Nabeela Kousar, a  British  national,  with  whom  he
    entered an Islamic form of marriage ceremony on 25.5.13 and  they  have
    been residing together since August 2013. She has two  British  citizen
    children from a previous relationship. His application was refused  and
    removal directions made on 14.11.13.

 7. It is worth noting that not only  did  the  refusal  decision  consider
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules, but from �46
    onwards consideration was given to article 8 outside the Rules  and  in
    particular under the five-stage Razgar test. At that time the appellant
    had only been living with Ms Kousar a few months, from August  2013  to
    the date of decision of 14.11.13. Judge North, however, had  to  assess
    the situation prevailing at the time of the hearing before him.

 8. Judge North  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had  the  'deep
    relationship' with Ms Kousar's children claimed by him. The  judge  was
    not satisfied that he and Ms Kousar met the  relationship  requirements
    and definition of a partner under E-LTRP 1.2 (GEN 1.2) and hence EX1 is
    not  reached  as  a  partner.  Neither  did  the  appellant  meet   the
    requirements of Appendix FM for leave to remain as a parent.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal also considered paragraph  276ADE  and  private
    life, in respect of which the judge was satisfied he retained  cultural
    links to Afghanistan.

10.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  then  proceeded  from  �13  of   the
    determination to consider whether there were circumstances outside  the
    Immigration Rules, in other words, consideration of a family life claim
    under article 8 ECHR as had been conducted by the Secretary  of  State.
    The judge was not satisfied as to  the  veracity  of  the  evidence  of
    family life between the appellant and his partner and her two  children
    and did not accept the  claim  that  he  represents  the  'only  father
    figure'  for  those  children,  with  the  appellant  and   Ms   Kousar
    downplaying what had been her earlier position -  that  she  could  not
    leave the UK because her children had a relationship with their natural
    father.

11. At �13 the judge stated, "I am not satisfied  that  the  appellant  has
    shown that he is engaged in a relationship with either Ms Kousar or the
    children of such substance that his removal  from  the  United  Kingdom
    would engage Article 8. Even if Article 8 were engaged to some  extent,
    I am not satisfied that the  interference  caused  by  his  removal  is
    disproportionate to the UK's legitimate aim in enforcing fair and  firm
    immigration control. For those reasons, I am not satisfied  that  there
    are any circumstances falling outside those specifically  provided  for
    in the Immigration Rules which require the  appellant's  appeal  to  be
    allowed under Article 8 of the ECHR." The appeal was thus dismissed.

12. The lengthy grounds of appeal assert that the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    failed to take account of material evidence and failed to give adequate
    reasons for his conclusions.

13. In granting permission to appeal, judge Tiffen noted that there  is  no
    reference in  the  determination  to  the  evidence  given  in  witness
    statements in the  appellant's  bundle  or  any  consideration  of  the
    pregnancy of the appellant's partner  when  reaching  his  conclusions.
    "The Tribunal Judge has failed to consider evidence before him  and  to
    apply anxious scrutiny to the evidence and  ultimate  decision  and  as
    such I conclude that there is an arguable error of law."

14. Considering the outline of the determination,  it  is  clear  that  the
    judge  first  considered  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules. In the light of Gulshan, Shahzad, and MF  (Nigeria),
    he then considered whether there were compelling circumstances  outside
    the Immigration Rules justifying allowing the appellant to remain under
    article 8 ECHR family on the basis that the decision would otherwise be
    unjustifiably harsh. Although no  such  compelling  circumstances  were
    found he went on in any event to consider article 8 ECHR  family  life.
    This he was required to do pursuant to section 86 of the 2002  Act,  as
    it was a ground of appeal. Recent authority (Ganesabalan v SSHD  [2014]
    EWHC 2712 (Admin)) has suggested that Appendix FM and 276ADE are not  a
    'complete code' for consideration of article 8 and there  is  always  a
    second stage consideration of proportionality outside the Rules  and  a
    consideration  as  to  whether  the  decision  to   remove   would   be
    unjustifiably harsh and thus disproportionate.

15. Ms Anthony explained that it was conceded at  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing that the appellant could not meet any of  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules for leave to remain and  thus  the  claim  is  in
    relation to article 8 family life only. She complains, however, that no
    reference was made to the pregnancy and associated evidence.  She  also
    submitted that the fact of  cohabitation  since  the  Islamic  marriage
    ceremony meant at least 1 year of relationship, with a child  expected.
    She also pointed out that  the  judge  made  no  reference  to  witness
    statements of neighbours (JI, J2,  &  A188),  and  Ms  Kousar's  sister
    (A184), and other documents tending to show a genuine  relationship.  I
    have carefully considered that material. There are short  letters  from
    neighbours stating that the appellant has been seen visiting Ms  Kousar
    and going out with her and her children. Ms Kousar's sister states that
    the appellant shows kindness and a loving approach to Ms Kousar and her
    children, with whom he has formed a good relationship.

16. More significantly, Ms Anthony complained that if  the  judge  rejected
    the contention of family life, he should have explained why he did  not
    accept the evidence. Finally, she submitted  that  the  judge  gave  no
    reasons for finding the decision proportionate and thus  the  appellant
    does not know the factors that  were  weighed  in  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise.

17. Ms Johnstone submitted that the judge had  provided  adequate  reasons.
    The judge found no genuine family life between the appellant, Ms Kousar
    and her children. The fact of an unborn child had little relevance; and
    a fresh application  could  be  made  once  the  child  was  born.  The
    appellant could not  meet  the  Rules  and  there  were  insufficiently
    compelling circumstances to allow the appeal outside  the  Rules  under
    article  8  ECHR  family  life  on  the  basis  that  the  decision  is
    unjustifiably harsh.

18. As far as pregnancy is concerned, the Tribunal could not  take  account
    of the situation of an unborn  child.  That  Ms  Kousar  was  expecting
    another child had only limited relevance, but is  potentially  relevant
    to support the claim to a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  Ms
    Kousar.

19. It is correct that the judge did not mention the statements and letters
    of neighbours and Ms Kousar's sister. However, those witnesses did  not
    attend to give evidence in support of the  appellant  and  thus  little
    weight could be  attached  to  them,  especially  since  there  was  no
    evidence that those persons existed or had written  those  letters  and
    statements. In any event, I note that at �3 of  the  determination  the
    judge stated that he had taken into consideration both the documents in
    the respondent's bundle and those in  the  appellant's  bundle  of  189
    pages, together with the skeleton argument drafted on  the  appellant's
    behalf.

20. It is not necessary for the judge to recite all of the evidence in  the
    determination, provided that it is clear that he has taken  account  of
    material evidence and disregarded immaterial matters.  I  am  satisfied
    that the judge did take into account all of the evidence placed  before
    him. There is no reason to doubt that when he said he had done  so,  he
    did. The matters now complained of were also  raised  in  the  skeleton
    argument and were, I understand from  Ms  Anthony,  part  of  her  oral
    submissions to the judge, and so would have been at  the  forefront  of
    the evidence and issues put before him.

21. There is no doubt that family life could exist between  parties  to  an
    Islamic ceremony of marriage, even though there was  no  civilly  valid
    marriage, and even if the relationship was relatively short. At �6  the
    judge noted that, after being detained when stopped for driving with no
    insurance or licence, the appellant had been released from detention in
    August 2013 to live at  Ms  Kousar's  home.  Thus  the  judge  did  not
    challenge the fact of cohabitation.

22. However, throughout the  determination  the  judge  gave  a  number  of
    reasons for doubting  the  appellant's  credibility  and  the  changing
    account of both the appellant  and  Ms  Kousar  as  to  her  children's
    relationship with either their natural father or the appellant, as well
    as his relationship with Ms Kousar as a partner.

23. There was in fact no evidence that the children  had  any  relationship
    with their natural  father,  as  noted  by  the  judge  at  �9  of  the
    determination. In the same paragraph the  judge  found  that  both  the
    appellant and Ms Kousar had been selective in the information they  had
    provided as to the children's welfare. In the circumstances, taking the
    determination as a whole, I find that  the  judge  has  justified  with
    cogent reasons his conclusion set out at �9 as to the  relationship  of
    the appellant with the children.

24. Even if he had ignored or overlooked  the  evidence  complained  of,  I
    cannot see that specific reference to the  pregnancy  and  the  letters
    from the  neighbours  and  Ms  Kousar's  sister  could  have  made  any
    difference to the outcome of the appeal, given the limited weight to be
    attached. Whilst it is dealt with relatively briefly in �13,  when  the
    determination is read as a whole, I find that  the  judge  did  provide
    cogent reasons why he was not satisfied that there was  genuine  family
    life between the appellant and Ms Kousar sufficient to  engage  article
    8.

25. In the alternative, the judge also considered that the decision was not
    disproportionate. The fact  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for leave to remain as a  partner
    or parent was taken into account at �10. At �11  the  judge  also  took
    into account the appellant's failure to make any  claim  to  regularise
    his status in the UK until after  he  came  to  the  attention  of  the
    authorities. The appellant had no valid  private  life  claim.  All  of
    these  matters,  including   the   changing   accounts,   significantly
    undermined the credibility of the appellant and Ms Kousar. Although  he
    does not spell in out in as many words, it is clear that the judge  did
    not believe the appellant and Ms Kousar and did not believe that  their
    relationship was genuine, whether it met the Immigration Rules or not.

26. I accept that it would have been better for the judge to set  out  what
    factors were taken into account in that balancing exercise. But in  the
    light of the findings as to family life, the decision could hardly have
    been disproportionate. However, as it was an alternative consideration,
    the  judge  having  already  reached  the  conclusion  that  there  was
    insufficient family life to engage article 8, there is in any event  no
    material error of law in this regard.  In  the  absence  of  a  genuine
    family life so as to engage article 8 in the  first  place,  the  claim
    could not succeed.

Conclusion & Decision

27. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
