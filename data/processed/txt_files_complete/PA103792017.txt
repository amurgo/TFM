                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Tony Kelly), sitting at Hatton  Cross  on  14  November
    2017, to  an asylum and human rights appeal by a citizen of Iraq,  born
    1992. Permission was  given  in  terms  which  provide  no  very  clear
    indication of the issues, the main one being on the judge's application
    of Devaseelan (Second Appeals - ECHR - Extra-Territorial Effect) [2002]
    UKIAT 702*.

 2. This appellant had made an illegal entry to this country in  2009,  and
    claimed asylum: his appeal against refusal had been dismissed by  Judge
    White in 2010. For no apparent reason, the Home Office took no  further
    action on this before the appellant made further submissions  in  2014,
    relying on article 15 (c) of the Qualification  Directive.  These  were
    eventually refused too, on 2 October 2017.

 3. The appellant had given an account on his original claim of his  father
    having been killed in 2009 by persons  unknown,  because  he  had  been
    working as a driver for the United States forces: he himself  had  left
    Iraq shortly after. Since the appellant had been finger-printed by  the
    Greek authorities on Samos in October  2008,  Judge  White  disbelieved
    this account, and rejected the authenticity of the documents relied  on
    to support it, as he was fully entitled to do. Judge Kelly was  equally
    entitled to take this finding as the starting-point of his decision  in
    the present case, so far as it went.

 4. That position was taken due account of by the person  who  drafted  the
    appellant's witness statement for these proceedings. At paragraph 6  he
    acknowledges that he can no longer rely on the version of events he had
    given in 2009 - 10. However, at paragraph 7 he goes on

       My father ... died in summer of 2008  before  I  left  Iraq.  ...  My
       mother is a housewife. She may still be living in Fallujah as far  as
       I know. When I last saw my mother, she was with my sister in Hai  al-
       Golan to where we had moved after my father died.

    The appellant goes on to say that his only sibling, a  sister,  is  now
    about 16 and he believes still in Iraq. He  has  or  had  one  paternal
    uncle, with whom he did not have much contact while he was growing  up.
    Otherwise he had no uncles or aunts, maternal or paternal.

 5. At paragraph 15  Judge  Kelly  set  out  the  basis  of  Judge  White's
    rejection of the appellant's case about the killing of his  father.  At
    16 he went straight on to find his evidence incredible in all respects,
    going on

       On the basis of Judge White's findings, I  consider  it  very  likely
       that the appellant's father and other close family members are  alive
       and continue to live in Fallujah ... and that he  would  continue  to
       have their support on his return.

 6. While Judge Kelly was fully entitled to reject the appellant's  account
    of hearing about his family from someone  he  had  met  in  a  cafï¿½  in
    Bristol, which he had given to Judge White, in my view he did  need  to
    deal in some way with the account the appellant had given from his  own
    knowledge (see 4) of his family's movements since 2008, which  was  not
    necessarily inconsistent with Judge White's rejection of his case about
    how his father had met his end.

 7. Hai al-Golan is  some  way  outside  Fallujah,  which  is  one  of  the
    'disputed areas' referred to in the country guidance. If the  appellant
    has no family members able to help him  there,  his  only  recourse  is
    likely to be internal relocation to Baghdad. The problem there is that,
    like most people in Fallujah, he is  a  Sunni.  Judge  Kelly  correctly
    cited the effect of paragraph (v)  of  the  judicial  head-note  in  BA
    (Returns to Baghdad Iraq CG) [2017] UKUT 18 (IAC):

       ... A Shi'a dominated government is supported by  Shi'a  militias  in
       Baghdad. The evidence indicates that Sunni men are more likely to  be
       targeted as  suspected  supporters  of  Sunni  extremist  groups  ...
       However Sunni identity alone is not sufficient to give rise to a real
       risk of serious harm.





 8. However the panel in  BA  had  placed  a  gloss  on  this  guidance  at
    paragraph 101:

       The respondent's most recent policy statement recognises that  Sunnis
       may face a real  risk  of  persecution  or  serious  harm  from  Shia
       militias in Baghdad. It goes on  to  state  that  tribal,  family  or
       political links, might mean a person is not at risk and can return or
       relocate to Baghdad. We find that  the  significance  of  a  person's
       religio-political identity to risk on return will  inevitably  depend
       on the circumstances of each case. The increasing levels of sectarian
       violence in Baghdad, albeit not sufficient if taken alone, are likely
       to be an important consideration in assessing whether  a  person  can
       demonstrate individual characteristics that would place him or her at
       real risk of serious harm.

 9. That makes it clear that, on the present state of the country  guidance
    (which is not of course set in  stone),  the  safety  or  otherwise  of
    return to Baghdad for a Sunni must always be a question to  be  decided
    on the facts of the individual case. That means it cannot be said  that
    Judge Kelly's questionable finding about the support available  to  the
    appellant in Fallujah was other than material to the result, and  there
    will have to be a fresh hearing before another judge.


Appeal : first-tier decision set aside
Fresh hearing, not before Judge Kelly, at Hatton Cross
