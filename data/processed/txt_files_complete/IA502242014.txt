Representation:

For the Appellant:     Not represented
For the Respondent:    Mr. D. Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Hussain  promulgated  on  30  April  2015  in  which  he
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision  to
    remove her from the United Kingdom.


 2. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:


    "I am however concerned that the First-tier Tribunal may have conflated
    the free-standing Article 8 test undertaken by Judge Grimmett with  the
    "reasonableness" test contained in both Appendix FM, EX.1 and paragraph
    276ADE in respect of the child (see paragraph 26 of the  determination,
    where the First-tier Tribunal relied  on  the  determination  of  Judge
    Grimmett when assessing the reasonableness of the child's removal).  In
    light of the authorities of MAB (para 399; "unduly harsh")  USA  [2015]
    UKUT 00435 (IAC) and Bossade (ss.117A-D- interrelationship with  Rules)
    [2015] UKUT 00415 (IAC)  it  is  arguable  that  consideration  of  the
    reasonableness of the child leaving the  United  Kingdom  should  focus
    solely on the consequences on the child and not take into account  more
    general Article 8 considerations."


 3. The Appellant was not represented.  I explained the  procedure  of  the
    hearing to her and asked her to let me know if she did  not  understand
    anything.  Mr. Mills assisted by expanding  on  his  submissions.   The
    Appellant stated that she wished to rely on the grounds which  she  had
    drafted to the First-tier Tribunal when seeking permission  to  appeal,
    and also those in the application for permission to appeal to the Upper
    Tribunal.   Following  Mr.  Mills'  submissions,  she  made  additional
    submissions which I have set out below.  At the end of  the  hearing  I
    reserved my decision which I set out below with my reasons.


Submissions


 4. The Appellant relied on the grounds of  appeal.   Mr.  Mills  submitted
    that the determination of Judge Grimmett promulgated  in  January  2012
    was  a  decision  made  under  Article  8,  as  it  was  prior  to  the
    commencement of Appendix FM, paragraph EX.1 and  paragraph  276ADE  the
    immigration rules.  He submitted that the issue was  whether  the  test
    which had been applied by Judge Grimmett  in  2012  when  conducting  a
    proportionality assessment under Article 8 was the same  test  as  that
    which should be applied in 2015 under the  immigration  rules.   I  was
    referred to the cases of MAB, KMO (section 117 - unduly harsh)  Nigeria
    [2015] UKUT 00543 (IAC), and AB (para 399(a)) Algeria [2015] UKUT 00657
    (IAC).  He submitted that there was a  difference  of  opinion  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  When permission was granted on 11 September  2015  the
    case of KMO had not yet been promulgated.   The  Respondent's  position
    was that KMO should be followed.


 5. He submitted that the case of MAB  held  that  the  question  of  undue
    harshness should relate only to the child and should  not  be  a  wider
    balancing exercise.  The effect on the child  and  her  best  interests
    should be considered and no more.  If MAB was correct then  the  First-
    tier Tribunal had to do  more  than  rely  on  the  decision  of  Judge
    Grimmett with reference to Devaseelan.


 6.  However  the  Respondent's   position   was   that,   following   KMO,
    consideration under the immigration rule (in that case  paragraph  399,
    but by analogy EX.1 and 276ADE),  should  be  by  way  of  a  balancing
    exercise.  What was unreasonable in all  the  circumstances  should  be
    considered,  including  public  interest  issues   arising   from   the
    Appellant's  criminality.   He  submitted  that  the  case  of  AB  had
    preferred KMO, and that Bossade did not address the point.  If KMO  and
    AB were correct, the judge had done  enough  by  looking  back  to  the
    previous  decision  of  Judge  Grimmett.   The   question   under   the
    immigration rules was whether or not it  was  unreasonable,  and  Judge
    Grimmett had considered this in his determination in 2012.


 7. The immigration rules had come into effect in between the  decision  of
    Judge Grimmett and the decision under appeal.   He  accepted  that  the
    judge needed to acknowledge the passage  of  time  since  the  previous
    decision.  However the judge had done so, and he had been  entitled  to
    find that the passage of time did not tip the balance in favour of  the
    Appellant and her daughter.  I was referred to paragraphs [23] and [24]
    of the decision.


 8. In response the Appellant submitted that the decision of Judge Grimmett
    had been made before the new rules came into force in  July  2012.   At
    the date of the decision of Judge Grimmett the Appellant's daughter was
    only 5 ï¿½ years old.  The Appellant had never had a  custodial  sentence
    but  had  only  done  community  service.   She  submitted   that   the
    application should be based on her daughter, who would be 10 years  old
    in three days' time  and  entitled  to  be  naturalised  as  a  British
    citizen.  She was in full-time education and it would be unfair to  ask
    her to leave the United Kingdom to go to a place that she did not know.
     Her daughter should be the primary consideration.  She submitted  that
    the First-tier Tribunal has taken as a starting point the  decision  of
    Judge Grimmett, which was when the Appellant's daughter was  only  five
    years old.  He had not considered the evidence before him but had  only
    relied on the earlier decision.


Error of law

 9. I have carefully considered the case law of MAB and KMO.  As stated  in
    AB, it is clear that it is not possible to follow both decisions  given
    the clear conflict between MAB and KMO.


10. The headnote to KMO states:


    "The Immigration Rules, when applied in the context of the  deportation
    of a foreign criminal, are a complete code.   Where  an  assessment  is
    required to be made as to whether a person meets  the  requirements  of
    para 399 of the Immigration Rules, as that comprises an  assessment  of
    that person's claim under article 8 of the ECHR,  it  is  necessary  to
    have regard, in making that assessment, to the  matters  to  which  the
    Tribunal must have regard as a consequence of the provisions of  s117C.
    In  particular,  those  include  that  the  more  serious  the  offence
    committed, the greater is the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  a
    foreign criminal.  Therefore, the word "unduly" in the  phrase  "unduly
    harsh"  requires  consideration  of  whether,  in  the  light  of   the
    seriousness of the offences committed by the foreign criminal  and  the
    public interest considerations that come into play, the impact  on  the
    child, children or partner of the foreign criminal  being  deported  is
    inordinately or excessively harsh."


11. When permission was granted, KMO had not been decided.  The headnote to
    MAB,  to  which  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Blum  referred  when  granting
    permission, states:


    "The phrase "unduly harsh" in paragraph 399 of the Rules (and s.117C(5)
    of the 2002 Act) does not import a  balancing  exercise  requiring  the
    public  interest  to  be  weighed  against  the  circumstances  of  the
    individual (whether child or partner of the deportee).   The  focus  is
    solely upon an evaluation of  the  consequences  and  impact  upon  the
    individual concerned."


12. It was  submitted  by  Mr.  Mills  that,  by  analogy  with  KMO,  when
    considering whether it  was  "reasonable"  to  expect  the  Appellant's
    daughter to leave the United Kingdom, consideration was required of the
    broader factors under Article 8.  If this was the case, the  judge  was
    entitled to rely on the previous findings of Judge Grimmett.


13. I have carefully considered the reasoning given in  KMO  for  departing
    from the approach advocated in MAB.  I prefer the reasoning set out  in
    KMO to that set out in MAB, for the reasons set out in KMO.


14. I therefore find that,  when  considering  the  reasonableness  of  the
    Appellant's daughter leaving the United Kingdom  for  the  purposes  of
    paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM, more general  considerations  should  be
    taken into account.  It should  be  more  than  an  assessment  of  the
    reasonableness of the child leaving the  United  Kingdom  by  reference
    only to  the  consequences  for  that  child.   Following  KMO,  it  is
    necessary to take into account wider considerations  under  Article  8,
    i.e. what is reasonable in all the circumstances, rather than  what  is
    reasonable for that child as a stand alone assessment.


15. Therefore, given that Judge Grimmett in January  2012  carried  out  an
    assessment of the proportionality factors under Article 8,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal judge was entitled,  following  Devaseelan,  to  rely  on
    those findings for the purposes of establishing whether or not  it  was
    reasonable to expect the  Appellant's  daughter  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom for the purposes of paragraph EX.1(a)(ii) (which considerations
    would be the same under paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv)).


16. It was acknowledged by Mr.  Mills  that  the  assessment  of  what  was
    reasonable had to take into account  the  passage  of  time  since  the
    decision of Judge Grimmett.  Paragraphs [23] and [24] state:


    "Insofar  as  family  relationships  were  concerned,   the   appellant
    confirmed that there had been no change since IJ  Grimmett's  decision.
    The only material change since  that  time  was  that  the  Appellant's
    daughter was now older.  This was  relevant  to  the  consideration  of
    appendix FM EX.1 of the immigration  rules  introduced  in  July  2012.
    This states that an exception can be made where  the  applicant  has  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a child who is  under
    the age of 18, is in the UK and has lived in the UK continuously for at
    least 7 years immediately preceding the date of application and that it
    would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK.


    Whilst this is a new requirement not previously before IJ Grimmett, the
    issues arising were nevertheless considered by him under his article  8
    assessment.  His analysis and  assessment  still  applies  and  is  not
    materially affected by the fact  that  the  appellant's  daughter  has,
    since his decision, now been living in the UK continuously for at least
    7 years whereas at the date of appeal, she had only been 5 years and  9
    months old."


17. It is clear from these paragraphs that  the  judge  was  aware  of  the
    passage of time.  He took into account that  the  Appellant's  daughter
    was now over the age  of  seven  and  refers  to  the  exception  under
    paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM.  However, he finds that the  passage  of
    time does not materially affect the  reasoning  of  Judge  Grimmett,  a
    finding which was open to him.


18. At paragraph [26] the judge states:


    "All the issues including  the  appellant's  daughter's  education  now
    raised by the  appellant  in  connection  with  the  welfare  and  best
    interests of the appellant's daughter were therefore  fully  considered
    by IJ Grimmett.  In the circumstances, it would not be unreasonable  to
    expect the appellant's daughter to leave the UK with the appellant,  in
    line with the findings made by IJ Grimmett."


19. In paragraph [28] the judge states that he does not consider that there
    is anything material that alters Judge Grimmett's decision  of  January
    2012.  He has already considered the passage of time resulting  in  the
    Appellant's daughter now being over the age  of  seven.   In  paragraph
    [32] he again states that he finds that there  has  been  "no  material
    change since the decision of IJ Grimmett in January 2012".


20. Given that I have preferred the reasoning in the case of KMO to that in
    MAB, I find that the judge was entitled to rely  on  the  analysis  and
    assessment  of  Judge  Grimmett   conducted   under   the   Article   8
    proportionality  assessment  when  assessing  whether  or  not  it  was
    reasonable to expect the  Appellant's  daughter  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.


21. I therefore find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal does  not
    involve the making of an error of law.



Notice of decision

    The decision does not involve the making of an error on a point of law,
    and I do not set it aside.


    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
