                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent




                         DETERMINATION  AND REASONS


  1. The  appellant,  a  citizen  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Yugoslavia
     (Kosovo),  appeals,  with  leave,  against  the  determination  of   an
     adjudicator, Mr I S  Kulatilake,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
     decision of the Respondent on 4 July 2001 to issue  removal  directions
     and refuse asylum

  2. Ms Y Adedje represented the appellant. Mr M Pichamuthu, a  Home  Office
     Presenting Officer, represented the respondent.

  3. Leave  was  granted  on  the  basis  that  it  was  arguable  that  the
     adjudicator did not give sufficient reasons for his conclusion that  it
     would not be unduly harsh  to  expect  the  appellant  to  relocate  to
     another part of Kosovo and he erred in his  conclusion  that  in  those
     areas the appellant's mixed ethnicity would not become known.

  4. The appellant came to the UK in 1999 when he was 19 years old.   He  is
     now 22 years old.  His father, who  was  of  Albanian  ethnicity,  died
     during the conflict in Kosovo when the family home was burned down with
     him inside it.  His mother, who is of Serbian ethnicity, has gone  back
     to Serbia and the appellant has lost touch with her.

  5. The basis of the appellant's current claim is that he fears return  due
     to his mixed ethnicity. In  this  he  relies  on  the  UNHCR's  current
     advice, dated April 2002, in the following terms.
           "While  most  Kosovo  Albanians  are  able  to  return   without
           protection difficulties, there are certain categories of  Kosovo
           Albanians who may  face  serious  problems,  including  physical
           danger, were they to return home at this  time.   These  include
           Kosovo Albanians in ethnically mixed marriages  and  persons  of
           mixed ethnicity.   Claims  from  persons  who  fear  persecution
           because they  belong  to  one  of  these  categories  should  be
           carefully  considered  in  order  to  ascertain  the  need   for
           international  protection.   Claims   not   falling   in   these
           categories may be considered in accelerated procedures."

  6. The adjudicator's basic findings are contained in paragraphs  16-19  of
     the determination, which states as follows.
           "The evidence before me shows the appellant lived all  his  life
           in the district  of  Prizren.  It  is  also  the  evidence,  the
           appellant's mother, whose present whereabouts the appellant does
           not  know,  has  since  returned  to  Serbia.   I   accept   the
           appellant's mixed ethnicity is likely to be known  to  those  in
           his village and perhaps also in the district of Prizren.  It  is
           also the evidence that the appellant had no call up for arms  by
           the KLA.  Accordingly I find that at the time the appellant left
           Kosovo in May 1999 he was not under any pressure from  the  KLA,
           and neither is there evidence he had been threatened, beaten  by
           KLA supporters, or for that matter from other Kosovan Albanians.
            The evidence before me is also insufficient to find the burning
           of the appellant's house with his father had anything to do with
           his father's mixed marriage.

           I cannot ignore the concerns of the UNHCR in their report of the
           risks to those like the appellant and against the bitter  ethnic
           conflict  that  raged  in  Kosovo,  the  appellant's  fears  for
           returning to Prizren I find are real.......  This is  because  I
           find KFOR and UNMIK will not be able to protect the appellant in
           his village

           However I do not consider it would be unduly harsh to expect the
           appellant to  relocate  perhaps  to  Pristina  where  his  mixed
           ethnicity will not be known and  moreover  where  the  appellant
           would be better placed in finding employment and housing."

  7. Ms Adedje did not challenged the findings concerning the KLA or on  the
     burning of house.   She  argued  however  that  the  finding  that  the
     appellant's mixed ethnicity was known not just in his village but  also
     in the district of Prizren, meant that he would not be safe anywhere in
     Kosovo because there would be people who would be likely  to  recognise
     him, particularly given the high level of internal displacement  within
     the province. Also the appellant's natural emotional reaction to  being
     returned to the area where his father was killed in his burning  house,
     meant that internal relocation would be  unduly  harsh.  In  short  she
     argued that there was no viable internal flight option and in any event
     it would be unduly harsh to expect the appellant to  return  to  Kosovo
     now.

  8. Mr Pichamuthu, in his submissions, argued that  each  case  has  to  be
     determined on its own merits.  It would not be  unduly  harsh  for  the
     appellant to relocate to Pristina and there was no real risk  that  his
     mixed ethnicity would be known to the authorities there  or  to  anyone
     else.  He relied on the assessment of  the  Tribunal  in  the  case  of
     Rexhapi concerning official documentation and information.

  9. The Tribunal reserved its decision.

 10. The crux of this appeal is whether  there  is  a  real  risk  that  the
     appellant's mixed ethnicity  would become known, were he to relocate to
     an area of Kosovo outside his home  district  of  Prizren.  Related  to
     this, is the associated question of whether such  relocation  would  be
     unduly harsh.

 11. When the appellant left Kosovo in 1999, he was a 19 year old working on
     the family farm in a small village in  the  district  of  Prizren.  His
     evidence at his asylum interview  was  that  he  and  his  family  were
     discriminated against because of their mixed ethnicity. The adjudicator
     correctly found that there was no evidence  of  treatment,  which  went
     beyond such discrimination and that the burning of the family home  and
     death of the appellant's father were not related to his mixed marriage.
      Indeed in the context of the objective material, which showed that the
     Serbians burned many Albanian homes at that time, it is not  surprising
     that this finding has not  been  challenged  by  Ms  Adedje.  There  is
     nothing in the evidence to suggest that the appellant was  particularly
     prominent or well-known in his home area.  Ms Adedje suggested that the
     adjudicator's finding that the appellant would  be  unsafe  in  Prizren
     district meant that there were large numbers of people  in  that  area,
     who would recognise the  appellant  and  know  that  he  was  of  mixed
     ethnicity. The Tribunal does not consider that either the  evidence  or
     the adjudicator's findings  justify  that  assertion.  The  adjudicator
     found that the appellant's mixed ethnicity would be known  in  his  own
     village and given the antipathy of ethnic Albanians towards  Serbs  and
     people of  mixed  ethnicity,  there  would  not  be  a  sufficiency  of
     protection available to him there. He realistically  extended  this  to
     the Prizren district. In doing so, he did not make the finding that the
     appellant or his family were widely known in the district as  a  whole.
     Prizren is however the administrative centre of the district and it was
     appropriate to draw as it were a cordon sanitaire around his home  area
     where there might be a real  risk  of  ill-treatment  as  described  by
     UNHCR.

 12. However, even though  Kosovo is a relatively small  area  overall,  the
     Tribunal finds that the adjudicator was not in error in concluding that
     the risk did not extend  beyond  the  appellant's  home  district,  for
     example to Pristina and that there was accordingly  a  viable  internal
     flight option. The appellant was only 19 in 1999 when he  left  Kosovo.
     He had not come to the notice of the KLA. He was not particularly well-
     known or prominent even in  his  home  area.   As  his  father  was  of
     Albanian ethnicity there is nothing in his name or behaviour that would
     now suggest mixed ethnicity to those who were  not  aware  of  it.   He
     would not be living with his mother, who is of  Serbian  ethnicity.  On
     the evidence before  us  we  endorse  the  conclusion  reached  by  the
     Tribunal in Rexhapi (which was not challenged by Ms  Adedje)  that  "we
     have no evidence before us to indicate that there is at  any  stage  at
     which either vis-ï¿½-vis officialdom in the form of such matters as ID or
     driving licences, or for any other purpose,  a  person  would  have  to
     reveal his mother's ethnicity or that in any other circumstances it  is
     a matter which might become apparent."

 13. The only risk is that he might be recognised by a person who  knew  him
     from his village as being of mixed ethnicity and that  that  person  or
     would be motivated to cause difficulties for him.  We do  not  consider
     that that risk is sufficient to constitute a real risk  of  persecution
     or of serious ill-treatment.  We agree therefore with  the  adjudicator
     that there is a viable internal flight option to Pristina.

 14. That leaves the question of undue harshness.  As  Ms  Adedje  said,  he
     will obviously  have been affected by his father's death,  even  though
     he  did  not  witness  it  himself  but  was  told  about   it   later.
     Unfortunately many people in Kosovo share similar experiences, but that
     does not mean per se that such a person cannot return to Kosovo now  in
     the  changed  circumstances  following  the  ejection  of  the  Serbian
     authorities. There is no medical evidence before us to suggest that the
     appellant has any specific and  material  medical  reasons  to  prevent
     return. The adjudicator found that  the  appellant  would  actually  be
     better placed in finding employment and housing in the  Pristina  area,
     and that conclusion is broadly supported  by  the  objective  material.
     The  Tribunal  concludes  therefore  that  the  appellant's  return  to
     Pristina would not be unduly harsh.

 15. This disposes of the appellant's  asylum  and  Article  3  claims.,  Ms
     Adedje mentioned, en passant, article 8 but as is clear from  paragraph
     20 of the determination, the appellant's representative rightly in  our
     view did not wish rely upon it then, and it is not a live issue  before
     us.

 16. For the reasons given above this appeal is dismissed.
