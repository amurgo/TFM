Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Adophy instructed by Saintta International
Lawyers
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer but I shall refer to the
    parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal that is Miss Xiuzhu
    Chen, Mr Xie Kailiang and Mr Xinyi Xie as the appellants and the  Entry
    Clearance Officer as the respondent.

 2. The appellants are wife and children of the sponsor Xie  Xioajiang  and
    they appealed against the decision dated  28th  February  2013  of  the
    respondent who refused to  grant  them  entry  clearance  to  join  the
    sponsor further to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The appeal was refused under the Immigration Rules  as  the  appellants
    could not comply with the financial requirements.  The  sponsor  earned
    �21,600 per annum and then there was a shortfall of  �3,140  under  the
    Rules.

 4. Following an application for permission to appeal I found an  error  of
    law and I therefore set aside the decision made by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Adio who allowed the appeal on human rights  grounds  considering
    the matter under Razgar v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2004] UKHL 27.

 5. The respondent had previously filed grounds for permission to appeal on
    the basis that Judge Adio had failed  to  follow  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT
    00640 and Nagre [2013] EWHC 720.  The judge had followed MM and  Others
    [2013] EWHC 1900 but this did not  dispute  the  Secretary  of  State's
    entitlement to set a minimum income  threshold.   It  established  that
    those who wished to set up family  life  in  the  UK  should  have  the
    financial ability to support themselves such that the  migrant  partner
    did not become a burden on the tax payer.

 6. I found that  the  requirements  as  set  out  in  Shahzad  (Article  8
    Legitimate Aim) [2014] UKUT 85 IAC and Gulshan required  that  arguably
    good grounds in the circumstances must be set  out  as  to  why  it  is
    necessary to consider the matter outside the Rules.

 7. At the hearing there was no interpreter but Mr Adophy confirmed that he
    was content to proceed and indeed took his instructions from his client
    via the solicitor's interpreter who also confirmed that  he  wished  to
    proceed on the day.

The Hearing

 8. The parties proceeded on the basis of submissions.  Mr Walker submitted
    that it was not contested that the appellant could  not  succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules because they had  insufficient  earnings.   There
    were no compelling circumstances as to why the wife and children should
    join him in this country.  The crucial stage  of  their  childhood  was
    over and at the time of the application the appellants were 16  and  17
    years old.  The sponsor had now attained indefinite leave to remain and
    had subsequently been granted British citizenship but this was on  17th
    April 2014.  There was no further evidence to show that, at the date of
    the decision, the sponsor could not return to China and his  Article  8
    application was without merit.

 9. Mr Adophy referred to his skeleton argument and submitted a signed copy
    of  a  witness  statement  which  was  already  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  He submitted that the appellant had failed because his gross
    annual income fell short by �3,000.  He was working and had  two  jobs.
    It was agreed that he earned below  the  stated  sum  and  yet  he  had
    savings of over �4,000 and his wife had �3,000 in a bank in China.   It
    could not be argued that the economic wellbeing  of  the  UK  would  be
    imperilled if the appellants were allowed to  join  the  sponsor.   The
    appellants had been separated from their father for eleven years and he
    wished them to be present  physically  with  him.   He  supported  them
    regularly with payments of over �800 a month.  He  only  earned  a  low
    wage and he would be unable to achieve  the  sum  of  �24,800.   It  is
    likely that his family would thus be permanently excluded on the  basis
    of the Rules and this was disproportionate.  The fact that he could not
    meet the Rules constituted an exceptionality.

10. The appellant produced his passports which showed that he had been back
    to China at least four times in 2011, 2012 and 2013.  He  had  returned
    on his Chinese passport.

Conclusions

11. The sponsor first met the first appellant in  January  1994  in  Fuqing
    China and they married in May  1995.   The  couple  continued  to  live
    together until the sponsor Mr Xie left China for the United Kingdom  on
    14th February 2003.  The appellant has the two  children  who  are  the
    second and third appellants and who  were  born  in  96  and  97.   The
    decision was made by the Entry Clearance Officer on 28th February  2013
    and it is this date that  I  need  to  take  into  account  when  I  am
    considering the matter.  The second and third appellants were 17 and 16
    at the date of the decision.  The sponsor entered the UK  in  2003  and
    thus has been  in  the  UK  for  eleven  years  and  had  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain on 7th October 2010 under the asylum  legacy
    case policy.  It is clear that he was not actually granted asylum and I
    note that there is no bar on him  returning  to  China  and  indeed  he
    stated that he had already returned four times  since  he  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in October 2010.

12. At the point of the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer the sponsor
    was not a British citizen.

13. The sponsor made a conscious  decision  to  come  to  the  UK  and  the
    starting point is that there is no obligation on the part of the UK  to
    support the sponsor and appellant's decision to establish their  family
    life wherever they  choose.   At  the  time  of  their  separation  the
    appellant and his wife knew that they had children.

14. The couple and the children undoubtedly have a family life as they  are
    man and wife and the children are biologically related to  the  sponsor
    in the UK but they are able to contact  each  other  through  telephone
    calls and video chat.

15. Although Section 55 applies specifically to children within  the  UK  I
    have  taken  into  account  the  best  interests  of  the  children  in
    accordance with the UN Convention  on  the  rights  of  the  child  but
    identify that they are living with their mother and are being supported
    financially by their father in the UK.  The witness  statement  of  the
    sponsor, which I read  carefully,  indicated  that  his  children  were
    students studying at Fuqing Haikou Middle School and Fuqing City  Jiang
    Jing Junior High School respectively.  They are living with  the  first
    appellant and therefore there is  no  indication  that  they  would  be
    separated from their parents.  They  are  clearly  housed,  engaged  in
    education and no doubt with  their  friends  and  other  relatives.   I
    accept that their father is in the United Kingdom  and  there  will  of
    course  be  a  protected  right  to  have  a  relationship  with  their
    biological father, but these are now  children  approaching  adulthood,
    who have entrenched their lives in China and will  have  formed  strong
    bonds there.  There was no indication that they could speak English and
    their cultural and social and linguistic ties are with China.

16. The children have spent the majority of  their  developing  lives  away
    from their father and the decision would  merely  maintain  the  status
    quo.

17. The Immigration Rules are a reflection  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    position in relation to Article 8 claims and the legitimate  aim  which
    is to be pursued in this  matter  is  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the
    country and the protection of the rights and freedoms of  others.   The
    matter has been extensively explored and Appendix FM paragraph  GEN.1.1
    states that the provision of the family route "takes into  account  the
    need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in  the  UK"  and
    secondly there is no  legal  requirement  that  the  Immigration  Rules
    should provide the best interests of the child should be determinative.
     Section 55 is not a trump card to be played.  MM Lebanon and Others  R
    on the Application of the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2014] EW Civ 985 confirms that it is reasonable  to  require  for  the
    child's best interests that there be adequate financial  provision  for
    the unit of which the child will be part of.

18. As stated at paragraph 148 MM [2014] appropriate weight has to be given
    to the position of the Secretary of  State  as  expressed  through  the
    Immigration  Rules,  particularly  where,  as  in  the  assessment   of
    maintenance, she acted on the results of independent research and wider
    consultations.

19. It was considered in MM Lebanon that it  is  not  the  court's  job  to
    impose its own view in respect of what constitutes the  minimum  income
    requirements unless the levels chosen  were  irrational  or  inherently
    unjust and it is concluded in that case that they were not.

20. I find that there are no arguably good  grounds  for  consideration  of
    this matter outside the scope of the Immigration Rules.  Weight  should
    be attached to the public interest and the position of the Secretary of
    State as set out in Appendix FM.  The sponsor has demonstrated that  he
    is able to return to China on a  regular  basis  and  although  it  was
    submitted that his children would be permanently  excluded  because  he
    would never be able to earn  appropriate  income  it  is  open  to  the
    appellant to do so.

21. I have taken into account the savings totalling �4,741 but  bearing  in
    mind the shortfall of �3,140 under the Rules which was accepted by  the
    appellants I am not persuaded that this would be sufficient  income  to
    allow the appellants to be maintained in the UK  even  over  the  short
    period of which they would initially be given leave.

22. I cannot agree with the point put forward by Mr Adophy that whenever  a
    case falls outside the Immigration Rules that it can be  considered  to
    be exceptional.  I have made it clear that I am  not  resurrecting  the
    exceptionality test but merely have considered  whether  further  to  R
    (Nagre) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWHC  720
    (Admin), Gulshan and  Shahzad  whether  there  are  any  arguably  good
    grounds to consider the matter outside Appendix  FM  and  I  find  that
    there are not.  This is not a case where one or other party  is  to  be
    removed and although the sponsor is now a British citizen this was  not
    the case as at the date of decision  and  the  sponsor  has  chosen  to
    remain in the UK between 2003 and 2010 when he had a precarious  status
    and during the time when his children's lives  were  developing.   They
    are now at the stage of almost adulthood and  the  status  quo  can  be
    preserved whereby the  appellants  and  sponsor  can  still  remain  in
    contact and experience visits from the sponsor as  they  have  done  to
    date.

23. I therefore dismiss the appeals of Mrs Ziuzhu Chen, Mr Xie Kailiang and
    Mr Xinyi Xie under the Immigration Rules and on human  rights  grounds.
