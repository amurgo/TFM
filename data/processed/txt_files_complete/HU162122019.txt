                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction:


      1. The appellant, a citizen of Kosovo, appeals with permission against
         the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as
         the "FtTJ") who dismissed his human  rights  claim  in  a  decision
         promulgated on the 24 April 2020.


      2. I make a  direction  regarding  anonymity  under  Rule  14  of  the
         Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal  Rules)  Rules  2008  as  the
         proceedings relate to the  circumstances  of  a  protection  claim.
         Unless  and  until  a  Tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise  the
         appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him. This  direction  applies
         both to the appellant and to the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
         with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

      3. The hearing took place on 4 September 2020, by means of  Skype  for
         Business. which has been consented to and not objected  to  by  the
         parties. A face to face hearing was not held  because  it  was  not
         practicable, and both parties  agreed  that  all  issues  could  be
         determined in a remote hearing.  I conducted the hearing from court
         at Bradford IAC. The advocates attended remotely via  video.  There
         were no  issues  regarding  sound,  and  no  substantial  technical
         problems were encountered during the hearing  and  I  am  satisfied
         both advocates were able to make  their  respective  cases  by  the
         chosen means.

      4. I am grateful to Mr Rashid and Ms Petterson for  their  clear  oral
         submissions.


Background:

      5. The appellant's claim is summarised in the decision of the FtTJ at
         paragraphs 4- 13.  The appellant is a national of Kosovo. He
         entered the United Kingdom in September 1999 at the age of 7 as a
         dependent child with his parents and siblings. Following
         unsuccessful asylum applications, the family was granted
         discretionary leave until May 2008 with indefinite leave to remain
         in November 2013.


      6. The appellant's offending history began in August 2011 and he
         accumulated three convictions for four offences including one
         offence of public disorder (2011), one offence relating to the
         police (2011) and one offence involving an offensive weapon in
         2011.

      7. On 9 August 2018 in the Crown Court, the appellant was convicted of
         producing class B drug cannabis. The sentencing remarks (F1 - F3)
         set out the circumstances of the crime. The appellant was involved
         in growing cannabis in a flat that belong to a family member which
         was described as a "full-scale growing cannabis factory" with
         plants with the possibility to create a range between �6080-�25,000
         and another room between �4322-�17,820. The judge considered it was
         a "significant enterprise" which the appellant embarked upon
         knowing the risks plainly more than personal use. He was sentenced
         to 18 months imprisonment.

      8. On 25 January 2019 respondent made a decision to deport the
         appellant and on 12 July 2019 made a deportation order. On 20
         August 2019, the respondent refused the appellant's human rights
         claim.


      9. The appellant appealed against this decision and it was dismissed
         by the First-tier Tribunal in a decision promulgated on the 24
         April 2020.

     10. In that decision the FtTJ considered the appellant's claimed family
         life with his current partner and 4 children from his two previous
         relationships. The appellant had two children from his first
         relationship aged five and six and two further children aged four
         and two with another partner. The evidence before the judge was
         that he had maintained contact with the younger children and was
         working with social services for increased contact. As to the elder
         children, they also lived with their mother, but that contact had
         continued until January 2020 when their mother had stopped contact.
         At the time of the hearing he was in a relationship with a new
         partner who was born in Kosovo, who he had met on social media in
         December 2018, but met in person in June 2019. During his detention
         in custody they spoke daily. At the time of the hearing she was
         pregnant with their child. It was stated that he was part of a
         close family with his siblings and parents and that his father who
         had been injured in the war suffered post-dramatic stress disorder
         and depression.

     11. The appellant believed that there were very significant obstacles
         to his integration to Kosovo; he had not been back there since
         1999. He had no family support there and it was claimed that he
         would be destitute. The appellant confirmed that he spoke Albanian,
         Kosovan and English and that whilst he had not returned to Kosovo,
         both his father and sister had visited there three years ago. His
         father went in connection with his residence permit, but the
         purpose of his sister's visit was not known. The judge heard
         evidence from the appellant's partner, sister and mother and also
         from a friend. Their evidence is set out and summarised in the
         decision at paragraphs 8 - 12.

     12. The FtTJ set out her assessment of the evidence and her analysis
         under the rules at paragraphs 23 - 38. As the appellant had been
         sentenced to a term in excess of 12 months, the judge noted that
         the public interest required his deportation unless one of the
         statutory exceptions in paragraph 399 or 399A applied.

     13. When dealing with the exceptions relating to family life, the judge
         found that there was no evidence to show that the appellant had a
         genuine subsisting parental relationship with the two eldest
         children M and H (at [26)]. However, the judge was satisfied that
         the appellant had a genuine subsisting parental relationship with
         the two younger children E and for the reasons set out at [27].

     14. At [28] the judge took into account that the children were British
         citizens and entitled to the benefits of their nationality. The
         judge found that we would be unduly harsh with them to leave the UK
         to live without their mother and be with the appellant in Kosovo.
         The judge considered that the issue was whether it was unduly harsh
         for the children to remain in the UK without the appellant. The
         judge undertook a "best interests" assessment under section 55 of
         the BCIA 2009 stating that "it is well established that children
         fare better in the care of both parents wherever possible". The
         position of the children was that they lived with their mother and
         their parents were not in a relationship. The judge found it was
         "clearly in the children's best interests" remain with their mother
         who was their primary carer and provided for their protection,
         welfare safety and development. It had been raised in the evidence
         that the child E had ill health but the judge observed there had
         been no medical evidence to confirm that position and no evidence
         that the appellant had any particular importance role in the
         child's life, nor that the child had any particular emotional
         dependence on the appellant. The judge concluded that whilst the
         appellant's deportation may be harsh for both children, there was
         no evidence the level of harshness went beyond that which would be
         inevitably suffered by any child whose father was deported. The
         judge therefore concluded it would not be unduly harsh for the
         children to remain in the UK without the appellant.


     15. In respect of his relationship with his current partner, he
         accepted that she was a British citizen and that they were in a
         genuine subsisting relationship and were expecting a child (at
         [29]). The judge considered the evidence in relation to her
         circumstances at [30] noting that his partner was born in Kosovo
         and spoke Albanian; she had revisited the country in 2015 and
         whilst she may not have family in Kosovo, she was an adult who had
         knowledge of the country, its culture and societal norms. The judge
         concluded that in the light of that evidence, it would not be
         unduly harsh for his partner to leave the UK and live the appellant
         in Kosovo (at [30]). The judge also found that whilst it may be
         difficult for her to remain in the UK without the appellant, given
         that they did not live together and she had her parents and
         siblings in the UK who would support her, it would not be unduly
         harsh for her to remain in the UK without him (at[31]).


     16. In relation to his private life, the judge accepted that he had
         been lawfully resident in the UK for more than half his life. At
         [33] the judge concluded that he had lived in the UK for 20 years,
         had studied and worked in the UK and spoke English and thus those
         matters indicated "social and cultural integration". At [34] the
         judge considered whether there were very significant obstacles to
         his integration to Kosovo but on the evidence concluded that he
         would have no cultural or linguistic difficulties there where he
         was born and lived until he was 7. Whilst there were no close
         family members, he was an adult in good health and would return to
         Kosovo with educational qualifications and work experience gained
         the UK to assist him to secure employment in accommodation which
         would enable him to avoid destitution and forge a meaningful
         private life.


     17. At paragraphs 35 - 38 the judge dealt with paragraph 398 ( c)
         (S117C(6)) and considered whether there were any other "very
         compelling circumstances" over above those described in the
         exceptions to deportation to outweigh the public interest. Having
         considered his offending history and the seriousness of the
         offence, his conduct whilst in prison, the low risk of reoffending,
         his ties in the UK the length of residence in the United Kingdom
         and the nature of his relationship with partner who had engaged in
         a relationship in the full knowledge of his offending and the
         possibility of deportation, the judge found that there were no very
         compelling circumstances that would outweigh the public interest in
         his deportation. The judge therefore dismissed his appeal.


     18. Permission to appeal was issued and on 11 June 2020 permission was
         granted by FtTJ Keane.

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal:

     19. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic  the  Upper  Tribunal  issued
         directions, inter alia, indicating that it was provisionally of the
         view that the error of law issue could be determined without a face
         to face hearing and that this could  take  place  via  Skype.  Both
         parties have indicated that they were content for  the  hearing  to
         proceed by this method. Therefore, the Tribunal listed the  hearing
         to enable oral submissions to be given by each of the parties.

     20. Mr Rashid, Counsel on behalf of the appellant, who appeared  before
         the FtTJ relied upon the written grounds of appeal. There  were  no
         further written submissions.

     21.  There  were  also  written  submission  filed  on  behalf  of  the
         respondent in the form of a Rule 24 response.

     22.  I also heard oral submission from the advocates, and I am grateful
         for their assistance and their clear oral submissions.

     23. Mr Rashid began his submissions by relying on the written grounds.
         In respect of ground one, he submitted that the judge failed to
         adequately take into account the appellant's private life
         established in the United Kingdom having entered at the age of 7
         and had resided in the UK since that date and had not returned to
         Kosovo.

     24. Furthermore, in relation to paragraph 2, the judge had failed to
         take into account material facts in reaching her decision. The
         material fact relied upon was that the appellant was a primary
         carer for his two younger children and played a significant role in
         their lives. This was set out in the witness statement of the
         appellant at paragraph 23. However, the judge made a mistake of
         fact at paragraph 27 where he confused the elder children with the
         younger children. Mr Rashid referred the tribunal to the letter
         from the social services page 60 which demonstrated that he was
         having contact with the children. In support of his submission that
         the appellant was a primary carer with a significant relationship
         with the children he referred the tribunal to the photographs of
         the appellant with the children at page 75 and a telephone call log
         pages 23 to 31 which he stated showed telephone calls between the
         appellant and the mother of the younger children organising
         contact. Whilst he referred to the telephone log, there was no
         reference to that in the witness statement filed on behalf of the
         appellant. Mr Rashid also pointed to the photographs. He submitted
         that the error was material because it would have affected the
         consideration of whether it was unduly harsh for the children to
         remain in the UK without the appellant and in particular the child
         E who had "a mental health condition".


     25. As to the issue of family life with his adult family members, Mr
         Rashid submitted that the appellant's father was suffering from ill
         health and there were photographs of his father and also medical
         evidence (a list of medication at pages 76 - 86 of the bundle). He
         submitted that the judge had failed to make findings on these facts
         and the effect upon removal of the other family members.

     26. Mr Rashid submitted that the judge did not take into account his
         relationship with his current partner and had mis-stated the facts
         in relation to contact with the children.

     27. Ms Petterson relied upon her Rule 24 response. In summary, the
         respondent submits that the judge of the First-tier Tribunal
         directed himself appropriately.

     28. Ms Petterson pointed out that in general terms, FTT Judge Keane who
         granted permission did not consider it arguable that FTT Judge
         Thomas erred in finding that the appellant could not meet the
         Exceptions to deportation relying upon his children and his current
         partner. The respondent submitted that if this ground is still
         relied upon at the hearing that FTT Judge Thomas made clear
         findings of fact on these issues and it cannot be said that these
         were unreasoned or not open to the Judge.

     29. It was submitted that in granting permission FTT Judge Keane
         considered there may be merit in the argument that the FTT did not
         properly consider the position of the appellant's relationship with
         his parents in the United Kingdom, and that the appellant's father
         has serious health issues. However, the respondent pointed out that
         the evidence before the FTT (from one of the appellant's sisters)
         was that the father had travelled to Kosovo in 2015. In any event,
         at the age of 28, there would need to be significant elements of
         dependency for the appellant to claim a protected family life with
         his parents, particularly since he has already formed relationships
         and had children with at least two partners, even if he has resided
         with his parents for some or all of that time. In addition, it is
         not clear how close relatives in the United Kingdom would prevent
         the appellant reintegrating into life in Kosovo.

     30. In her oral submissions Ms Petterson submitted that there was no
         material error in the decision of the FtTJ as it was clear on the
         evidence of the appellant was not a "primary caregiver "as
         submitted on behalf of the appellant. The judge accepted that
         contact had ceased and it restarted but the fact that he had
         contact did not make him a primary caregiver in relation to any of
         the children nor did it shed light on whether it be unduly harsh
         for the children to remain in the UK without the appellant.

     31. She submitted that contrary to the submissions made on behalf of
         the appellant, there was no evidence to demonstrate that the child
         E had any significant ill-health. There was no medical evidence as
         the judge had recorded and importantly there was no evidence of any
         particular dependence or otherwise upon the appellant. The
         relationship between the appellant and his children was not
         properly evidenced and the medical condition of E was not the
         subject of any medical evidence. The judge was correct in reaching
         the conclusion that the children lived with their respective
         mothers and would continue to do so in the event of the appellant's
         deportation.

     32. As to the claim family life with the adult family members, whilst
         the appellant lived with his parents there was no evidence to
         suggest that the appellant's father was dependent upon the
         appellant and it was clear that the appellant's mother gave
         evidence that she was there and supported her husband. Ms Petterson
         accepted that his father would be saddened at his departure, but
         the evidence did not demonstrate any additional ties other than
         normal emotional ties between the family members living in the same
         household. Therefore she submitted whilst the judge did not refer
         to his family life with his parents, the judge was aware of it but
         it was not advanced on the appellant's behalf that he was required
         to remain in the UK to care for him.

     33. As to his length of residence, it was plain that the judge was
         aware of that length of residence a clear findings that there were
         no very significant obstacles to his reintegration taking into
         account that he was in good health, that it studied in the UK, and
         would be able to obtain employment and avoid destitution.

     34. Consequently, it was submitted that there is no material error in
         the determination.

     35. By way of reply Mr Rashid submitted that in relation to the issue
         of dependency the judge had not referred to the appellant's
         relationship with his parents and that there was evidence in the
         papers before the judge from the appellant's mother and sister and
         therefore the judge should have referred to that evidence. He
         further submitted that even if the issue of dependency had not been
         raised before the judge it had been evidenced in the witness
         statements and was therefore unchallenged because the presenting
         officer did not cross examine as to the level of dependency. As the
         issue was therefore unchallenged it can be taken that the issue was
         therefore raised on the evidence.

     36. In conclusion he invited the Tribunal to set aside the decision and
         as this was a fact sensitive appeal, it should be remitted to the
         FtT for a further hearing.

     37. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision which I now
         give.

    Discussion:

     38. I have carefully considered the written grounds and the oral
         submissions of Mr Rashid, who was counsel before the FtTJ but was
         not the author of the grounds. Having considered the submissions I
         agree with Judge Keane's assessment that the majority of the
         written grounds amount to no more than a disagreement with the
         findings of fact made by the judge and her assessment of the
         evidence. In Durueke (PTA: AZ applied, proper approach) [2019] UKUT
         00197 (IAC), this tribunal held that: "(ii) Permission should only
         be granted on the basis that the judge who decided the appeal gave
         insufficient weight to a particular aspect of the case if it can
         properly be said that as a consequence the judge who decided the
         appeal has arguably made an irrational decision. As the Court of
         Appeal said at para 18 of Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 412, it is
         necessary to guard against the temptation to characterise as errors
         of law what are in truth no more than disagreements about the
         weight to be given to different factors, particularly if the judge
         who decided the appeal had the advantage of hearing oral evidence.

     39. Paragraph 1 of the written grounds states that the judge erred in
         "failing to attach proper weight to the appellant's residence of 20
         years in the UK" and then refers to the appellant having "no ties"
         and" lacking in support". The grounds assert that the findings made
         by the judge in relation to paragraph 399A (c ) are "inadequate and
         lack sufficient reasoning".

     40. However, the grounds fail to consider the factual findings made by
         the FtTJ at paragraph [34] which deal with paragraph 399A (c). The
         judge had earlier accepted that the appellant had lived in the UK
         for 20 years and therefore had been lawfully resident for more than
         half of his life (see paragraph [32]. At [33] the judge also
         accepted that as he had studied and worked in the United Kingdom
         and spoke English, those matters indicated social and cultural
         integration. The judge did not however consider his criminality.

     41. At [34] the judge went on to consider the issue of whether there
         were very significant obstacles to his reintegration and on the
         evidence was entitled to take into account that the appellant would
         have no cultural or linguistic difficulties on reintegration to
         Kosovo where he was born and lived until he was seven. The judge
         was plainly aware that he had no close family members in Kosovo but
         considered the appellant's personal circumstances and
         characteristics. The judge took into account that he was an adult
         in good health who would be returning to Kosovo with educational
         qualifications and work experience gained in the UK to help him
         secure employment and accommodation which would mean that he would
         not be destitute as the grounds assert.   The assessment of the
         FtTJ was consistent with paragraph 14 of the decision in The
         Secretary of State for the Home Department v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ
         813 where it was held that "The idea of 'integration' calls for a
         broad evaluative judgment to be made as to whether the individual
         will be enough of an insider in terms of understanding how life in
         the society in that other country is carried on and a capacity to
         participate in it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity to be
         accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-day basis in that
         society and to build up within a reasonable time a variety of human
         relationships to give substance to the individual's private or
         family life."

     42. Nor do the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant
         demonstrate that the judge's assessment of paragraph 399A (c) were
         "inadequate". Mr Rashid's oral submissions relied upon the written
         grounds that I have just summarised and did not raise any new
         point. At its highest, Mr Rashid submitted the judge did not place
         "adequate weight" on his residence of 20 years. However it is plain
         that the judge gave express consideration to his length of
         residence both at paragraph 33 when considering the requirements of
         paragraph 399A and also at paragraph 38 when considering whether
         there were "very compelling circumstances" stating that the
         appellants length of stay in the UK on its own did not carry such
         force to satisfy the "very compelling" test.

     43. Therefore, so far as paragraph 1 of the grounds are concerned, the
         challenge to the judge's assessment of paragraph 399A (c) does not
         demonstrate any error of law in the FtTJ's assessment.

     44. I now turn to paragraph 2 of the grounds. In this paragraph a
         number of assertions are made under "very compelling circumstances"
         and the grounds set out a number of factors which it is asserted
         that the judge failed to have regard to in the overall balance.

     45. When assessing very compelling circumstances in the context of
         Section 117C(6) the Court of Appeal in the case of NA (Pakistan) v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662
         Jackson LJ gave significant guidance.  This Appellant is what is
         described as a "medium offender".  The following paragraphs of NA
         are of assistance:-

             "29.  In our view, the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in  JZ
             (Zambia) applies to those  provisions.   The  phrase  used  in
             section 117C(6), in para. 398 of the 2014 rules and  which  we
             have held is to be read into section  117C(3)  does  not  mean
             that a  foreign  criminal  facing  deportation  is  altogether
             disentitled from seeking to rely on matters falling within the
             scope of the circumstances described in  Exceptions  1  and  2
             when seeking  to  contend  that  'there  are  very  compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2'.  As we have indicated above,  a  foreign  criminal  is
             entitled to rely upon such matters, but he would  need  to  be
             able to point to features of his case of a kind  mentioned  in
             Exceptions 1 and 2 (and in paras. 399  or  399A  of  the  2014
             rules),  or  features  falling   outside   the   circumstances
             described in those Exceptions and those paragraphs, which made
             his claim based on Article 8 especially strong.

             32.    Similarly, in the case of a medium offender, if all  he
             could advance in support of his Article 8 claim  was  a  'near
             miss' case in which he fell short of bringing  himself  within
             either Exception 1 or Exception 2, it would not be possible to
             say that  he  had  shown  that  there  were  'very  compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2'.  He would need to have a far stronger case  than  that
             by reference to the interests protected by Article 8 to  bring
             himself within that  fall  back  protection.   But  again,  in
             principle there may be cases in which such an offender can say
             that features of his case of a kind described in Exceptions  1
             and 2 have such great force for Article 8 purposes  that  they
             do constitute  such  very  compelling  circumstances,  whether
             taken by themselves  or  in  conjunction  with  other  factors
             relevant to Article 8  but  not  falling  within  the  factors
             described in Exceptions 1 and 2.  The decision  maker,  be  it
             the Secretary of State or a tribunal, must  look  at  all  the
             matters  relied  upon  collectively,  in  order  to  determine
             whether they are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the  high
             public interest in deportation.

             33.    Although there is no 'exceptionality'  requirement,  it
             inexorably follows from the statutory scheme that the cases in
             which circumstances are sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh
             the high public interest in deportation  will  be  rare.   The
             commonplace incidents of family life, such as  ageing  parents
             in poor  health  or  the  natural  love  between  parents  and
             children, will not be sufficient.

             36.    In relation to a medium offender, first see whether  he
             falls within Exception 1 or Exception 2.  If he does, then the
             Article 8 claim succeeds.  If he does not, then the next stage
             is to consider  whether  there  are  'sufficiently  compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2'.  If there are, then the Article 8 claim succeeds.   If
             there are not, then the Article 8 claim  fails.   As  was  the
             case under the 2012 rules  (as  explained  in  MF  (Nigeria)),
             there is no room for a general Article  8  evaluation  outside
             the 2014 rules, read with sections 117A-117D of the 2002 Act."

     46. The first factor identified and relied upon by Mr Rashid relates to
         the children. Neither the written submissions nor the oral
         submissions have regard to the evidence that was in fact before the
         judge and her assessment of that evidence. The first point made by
         Mr Rashid, although not addressed in the written grounds, is that
         the FtTJ made an error of fact at paragraph 27 in her decision
         where it is said she confuses circumstances of the eldest children
         with those of the younger children.

     47. I have considered with care that submission and have done so in the
         light of the evidence before the judge and her decision. The
         appellant was the father of four children from two previous
         relationships. His two elder children are M and H (age 5 and 6
         respectively). The evidential position concerning his relationship
         with them was that he had maintained contact with them until
         January 2020 when his ex-partner found out about his new
         relationship (see paragraph 30 of the appellant's witness
         statement).  He claimed that he was currently working with the
         social worker to initiate contact and had a meeting arranged later
         in March 2020. The position with the two youngest children, E and
         A, who were aged four and two respectively) was that the appellant
         and the children had lived at the family home until September 2019
         when the relationship came to an end. Since that date the appellant
         stated that he had visited the children and that he had maintained
         contact with them and also that social services had been involved
         to ensure contact was maintained (as set out in the witness
         statement at paragraph 23).


     48. When looking at the decision of the FtTJ, the judge summarised the
         position of the children at paragraph 6 in accordance with the
         summary that I have set out in the preceding paragraph. There is no
         error of fact in the summary of the evidence given by the judge at
         paragraph 6.

     49. However, Mr Rashid submits that at paragraph 27 the judge confuses
         the evidence relating to the children. The judge stated as follows:


             "27. There is evidence to support the appellant's claim he has
             had contact with his two  youngest  children  E  and  A  until
             January 2020, whilst they  lived  with  their  mother  at  the
             appellant's family home. The evidence in (a) a letter  of  the
             social worker including a contact plan to December  2019;  (b)
             the judge's sentencing remarks which include references  to  2
             of the  appellant's  children;  and(c)  the  evidence  of  the
             appellant's mother  and  sister:  lead  me  to  conclude,  the
             appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with these
             two children which engages the exception in paragraph 399  (a)
             of the rules."


     50. There is an error identified at paragraph 27. Where the judge
         states that the appellant had contact to the two younger children
         until January 2020 whilst they lived with their mother at the
         family home, the mistake is that they lived together as a family
         until September 2019 which was when the relationship with his
         partner ended and the appellant's evidence is that he maintained
         contact with them thereafter. Therefore, the judge made a factual
         error identifying the date of January 2020 instead of September
         2019. However, whilst the FtTJ made a mistake of fact (stating
         January 2020) instead of September 2019) it is wholly immaterial
         because the FtTJ then went on to correctly identify the evidence in
         support of the ongoing genuine and subsisting relationship with the
         two younger children. The judge identified the evidence in support
         of her conclusion at paragraph 27 which included the letter from
         the social worker (exhibited at pages 60 - 61 of the appellant's
         bundle). This stated that the children were known to the social
         services and that the children lived mainly with their mother and
         the appellant had regular contact with them, currently weekly, and
         that there was a plan to increase that. The FtTJ made reference to
         the schedule of contact set out at page 61. The judge also
         identified the evidence in the judge's sentencing remarks which
         referred to his contact with the children but rejecting his claim
         to have been their primary carer and also the judge identified the
         evidence from the appellant's sister and mother. The judge
         therefore concluded that the evidence demonstrated that he had a
         genuine and subsisting parental relationship with his two youngest
         children and therefore this engaged the exception of paragraph 399
         (a). The factual mistake did not affect the conclusion reached at
         paragraph 27 and was therefore wholly immaterial.


     51. The next point Mr Rashid relied upon is one set out in the written
         grounds that the judge failed to consider the appellant's role as a
         children's "primary caregiver" and that he played a significant
         role in their lives. The grounds go on to say that "in light of the
         judges acceptance that he had a genuine and subsisting parental
         relationship with at least two of his children, it was necessary to
         consider the impact it would have on them if he was now deported."

     52. In support of his submission, Mr Rashid pointed the Tribunal to the
         evidence in the form of photographs (pages 75 - 86) and a telephone
         call log (supplement bundle pages 23 - 31).

     53. Whilst the appellant's evidence in his witness statement (paragraph
         24 dated16/3/20) refers to his relationship with the two younger
         children  as playing a "significant role in their lives" and
         paragraph 25 referring to having "full custody" the children, there
         was no reference to being the primary caregiver as both the grounds
         assert or the oral submissions. In fact, the independent evidence
         from the social services set out at page 60 was that the two
         youngest children lived mainly with their mother but that their
         father, the appellant, had contact with them. Furthermore the
         judge's sentencing remarks, (which were referred to by the judge at
         paragraph 27) recorded the evidence from the pre-sentence report
         and expressly stated "you are not the principal carer for them and
         have not been in reality for any significant period of time. The
         pre-sentence report indicates that your former partner is the carer
         of them." The evidence of the social services and the judge's
         sentencing remarks were referred to by the judge at paragraph 27
         and properly read did not support the claim made in the grounds
         that the appellant was the principal carer or the "primary carer"
         of the children. The photographs do not provide any assistance
         evidentially as supportive of being their primary carer. The
         photographs are not dated and show the appellant with the children.
         It is not disputed that they have ongoing genuine and subsisting
         relationship with him. The telephone log also does not have any
         evidential weight. There is no description in the evidence which
         addresses those telephone calls. Whilst Mr Rashid made reference to
         the front sheet making reference to the telephone log as "arranging
         contact with children from father's mobile phone to ex-partner"
         that does not by itself demonstrate the nature and strength of the
         relationship.


     54. That being the case, the submission made on behalf of the appellant
         that there was a failure to address that factor under the "very
         compelling circumstances" test under section 117C(6) is misplaced.

     55. Mr Rashid relied upon the written grounds where it was stated that
         the judge should have made a finding on whether she accepted that
         the child E suffered from ill health and if so" given the
         appellant's role as primary caregiver are there compelling reasons
         for the appellant's continued presence to care for the child?" (See
         written grounds of paragraph 2).

     56. In my judgement the grounds mis-state the evidence and the decision
         of the FtTJ. At [28] the FtTJ addressed the issue of E's ill health
         but noted that there was no medical evidence to confirm his ill-
         health but importantly there was no evidence that the appellant had
         any particular important role in E's life nor that he had any
         particular dependency on the appellant (either in the context of
         his ill-health or otherwise). There was little evidence in support
         of his relationship with the children and I do not accept that
         photographs and a phone log can properly evidence the strength and
         nature of their relationship. Whilst the judge referred to no
         contact since January her assessment of the position of the child
         with the appellant's partner as the primary carer was consistent
         with the more reliable evidence set out in the social work letter
         (pages 60 - 61) and the judge's sentencing remarks (at F3).

     57. None of those issues raised in the written grounds and the oral
         submissions demonstrate any material error of law in the approach
         to the judge's assessment of either undue harshness which the judge
         considered substantively at paragraph 28 or the Exceptions to
         deportation relevant to the appellant's private and family life.

     58. The final issue relates to the position of the family members and
         the issue of dependency. In particular it is said the relationship
         between the appellant and his father. It appears to be common
         ground that the appellant continued to live at the family home. As
         part of the evidence put to the Secretary of State it was asserted
         that the appellant had close relationships with his family members.
         The respondent and the decision letter addressed the issue by
         stating that the appellant had not provided evidence of dependency
         beyond normal emotional ties and that the family members could
         maintain their relationships either by modern means of
         communication or family members either visiting or accompanying him
         to Kosovo.

     59. The grounds assert that the judge failed to take any account of the
         dependency that the appellant's father had upon the appellant. Mr
         Rashid submitted that there was evidence before the Tribunal that
         family members such as the appellant's father had a relationship of
         dependency upon his son but that the judge had made no reference to
         it.

     60. There was no reference to any submissions made on the issue of
         family life or any dependency between the adult family members in
         the judge's summary of the submissions of the parties and in
         particular those on behalf of the appellant at paragraph 21. I
         asked Mr Rashid as to whether the issue of dependency was raised
         before the FtTJ, as he was Counsel before the First-tier Tribunal.
         He could not remember whether he had raised the issue in his
         submissions. I could not read all of the ROP (record of
         proceedings) and Ms Petterson did not have access to the ROP of the
         presenting officer. I am therefore left in the position that it is
         not clear whether in fact this was raised or argued as part of the
         "very compelling circumstances" relied upon.

     61. There was evidence before the judge which could give rise
         potentially to such a submission. The evidence of the appellant
         referred to his father having "serious health issues". Whilst the
         grounds refer to medical evidence in support, there was no medical
         report. Mr Rashid has pointed out there were copies of
         prescriptions at page 76 of the bundle. However, there is no
         indication from the lists of medication there what they were
         prescribed for or for what conditions. A list of prescriptions
         without more does not give weight to the argument of there being
         "serious health concerns". The evidence of the family members as
         identified by Mr Rashid makes reference to the past family history
         and Kosovo and in particular that the appellant's father had been
         injured and had suffered burns to his body and his experiences
         resulted in PTSD and depression. There are photos of the
         appellant's father which appear to show burns to his body. However,
         the evidence of the family members as to the level of dependency
         either between them and the appellant or in particular, the
         appellant's father upon the appellant, was lacking in any detail to
         satisfy the test of dependency. I do not accept the submission made
         by Mr Rashid that because the witnesses referred to their close
         relationship with each other that this could be taken as the judge
         having tacitly accepted the evidence or that such evidence could be
         taken as unchallenged. Here the evidence did not go beyond showing
         the family members had lived together even when the appellant was
         an adult and that they were a close family. The test for the
         establishment of Article 8 family life in the Kugathas sense is one
         of effective, real or committed support and whilst there is no
         requirement to prove exceptional dependency the evidence did not
         demonstrate any dependency upon the appellant by his father beyond
         normal emotional ties. As Ms Petterson submitted, the evidence
         before the judge from the appellant's sister was that
         notwithstanding the circumstances in which the family had left
         Kosovo, the appellant's father felt able to return there and travel
         to Kosovo in or about 2015 (as recorded at paragraph 9 of the
         judge's decision). Furthermore, the appellant's father had a number
         of other close relatives including his wife for support.


     62. In my judgement whilst there is no "bright line" for when family
         life ceases to exist, the appellant is now 28 years of age and
         there would need to be factual elements of dependency to support a
         claimed protected family life with his parents particularly as he
         has founded two previous relationships with partners and has had
         four children, has formed his own family units and independent life
         even if he resided with his parents for all or most of that time.

     63. As set out above, it has not been properly demonstrated that such
         an argument had been advanced before the FtTJ and in my judgment it
         is not sufficient to say that as there was some evidence, it was
         incumbent on the FtTJ to embark on such an analysis. The
         proceedings are adversarial and the arguments before the FtTJ are
         those raised by the parties. However, the evidence even taken at
         its highest does not demonstrate factual elements of dependency and
         does not go beyond showing the normal emotional ties between adult
         family members. I am therefore not satisfied that it has been
         demonstrated that the FtTJ fell into any material error of law in
         addressing the "very compelling circumstances" test under S117C(6).

     64. The question whether the decision contains a material error of law
         is not whether another Judge could have reached the opposite
         conclusion but whether this Judge reached a conclusion by
         appropriately directing himself as to the relevant law and
         assessing the evidence on a rational and lawful basis.

     65. The judge had the advantage of considering all the evidence in the
         case.  As the Supreme Court stated in Henderson v Foxworth
         Investments Ltd [2014] UKSC 41; [2014] 1 WLR 2600 at [62]:

             "It does not matter, with whatever degree of  certainty,  that
             the appellate court considers that it  would  have  reached  a
             different conclusion. What matters  is  whether  the  decision
             under appeal is  one  that  no  reasonable  judge  could  have
             reached.

     66. For those reasons, I am satisfied that it has not been demonstrated
         that the decision of the FtTJ did involve the making of an error on
         a point of law. The decision of the FTT shall stand.
