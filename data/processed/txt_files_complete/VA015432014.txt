                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  29th  July  1967.   She
    appeals against a decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Fox
    sitting at Birmingham Sheldon Court on 18th November 2014 in  which  he
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against a decision of  the  Respondent
    dated 25th February 2014.  That decision was to refuse entry  clearance
    to the Appellant as a visitor under paragraph  41  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  There being no separate right  of  appeal  under  paragraph  41
    itself,  the  Appellant's  argument  was  that  the  decision  of   the
    Respondent breached her rights under Article 8 (right  to  respect  for
    private and family life) of the European Convention  on  Human  Rights.
    The Appellant wished to visit her brother  who  would  accommodate  her
    during the visit.

The Refusal

2.   The Respondent rejected  the  application  under  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41 considering that the Appellant's brother did not have  the
    means to fund the Appellant's stay.  It was not  clear  what  level  of
    responsibility he had in meeting his own financial responsibilities and
    obligations.  The Appellant's visit would add additional stress to  the
    Sponsor's  finances.   The  Respondent  was  not  satisfied  that   the
    Appellant would leave the United Kingdom upon completion of the  visit.
    The Appellant had claimed to have done voluntary work  at  her  church.
    Her bank account showed approximately �575 but as she did not receive a
    monthly income from her voluntary work  doubt  was  raised  as  to  the
    origin of that money.  The balance on the account had been inflated  by
    deposits totalling �545 made over the course of three months  prior  to
    submitting the visa application.  The Appellant had acknowledged in her
    application form that she did not receive  an  income  from  any  other
    source.

3.   The claimed cost of the trip would be �1,000  and  the  Respondent  was
    not satisfied that it was reasonable for the Appellant  to  incur  that
    expense given her circumstances.  The Appellant was unmarried  and  had
    no-one dependent upon her.  She had not declared any assets, savings or
    property and the Respondent was not satisfied that  the  Appellant  had
    shown sufficiently strong  ties  to  Pakistan.   There  was  little  to
    encourage her to leave the United Kingdom upon completion of the visit.
     She had never travelled outside Pakistan before and had therefore  not
    demonstrated compliance with any restrictions imposed upon her stay  in
    another country.

The Decision at First Instance

4.   The Appellant appealed against that decision arguing that her  evidence
    was credible but had been ignored by the Respondent.  Although this was
    not a spouse case the logic of cases such  as  MM  was  that  financial
    issues should be considered under human rights grounds.

5.   The Judge rejected the argument and at paragraph  [17]  considered  the
    Article 8 factors  in  the  case  when  assessing  the  proportionality
    exercise.  The Judge wrote:

         "I have taken into account all relevant factors including  but  not
         limited to those referred to above  and  below.   The  robust  good
         health of the Appellant and the Sponsor.  The fact that  they  each
         have chosen to live their lives in different countries.   That  the
         Sponsor and Appellant  continue  to  remain  in  contact  with  one
         another and have done so over the  years  without  any  difficulty.
         The Sponsor claims that it is difficult for him to  travel  but  he
         gives me no detail on that.  As a  consequence  upon  the  lack  of
         evidence I have no hesitation in finding that he and the  Appellant
         can meet in Pakistan because he is able to travel."

6.   The Judge found at paragraph 11  that  the  Appellant  could  meet  the
    maintenance and accommodation requirements of paragraph 41 because  the
    Sponsor was able to afford to maintain and accommodate the Appellant if
    she were to arrive.  However at paragraph  12  the  Judge  doubted  the
    evidence he had received regarding the  Appellant's  own  finances.  He
    dismissed the appeal.

The Onward Appeal

7.   The Appellant appealed arguing that the Judge had overlooked a  witness
    statement from the Sponsor which had responded in detail to the grounds
    of the refusal both  in  terms  of  the  Appellant's  circumstances  in
    Pakistan as well as the Sponsor's circumstances in the United  Kingdom.
    The Sponsor had not attended to give oral evidence but the Judge should
    have considered the Sponsor's statement.  The Immigration  Rules  still
    needed to be considered in human  rights  appeals.   The  question  was
    whether the interference with the  Appellant's  private  and/or  family
    life was in accordance with the law.  If it was not then the  case  did
    not reach as far as the proportionality exercise.

8.   The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge White on 11th  February  2015.   In  refusing
    permission to appeal he stated he was not satisfied that Judge Fox  had
    made an error of law.  The Judge had made no specific reference to  the
    Sponsor's statement but the Appellant had requested an oral hearing and
    yet the Sponsor failed to attend that hearing. In such circumstances it
    was  highly  questionable  whether  any  significant  weight  could  be
    attached to the statement.  The proposed visit was one of  four  weeks.
    Given the circumstances of the party and the ability of  the  Appellant
    to make a fresh application it was open  to  the  Judge  to  find  that
    interference with  private  and  family  life  was  proportionate.   He
    refused permission to appeal.

9.   The Appellant renewed her application for permission to appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal in broadly similar terms.  The application  came  before
    Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on 6th July 2015.  In granting permission to
    appeal he wrote:

         "Whether the Appellant met  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
         Rules is relevant to the proportionality exercise but  the  grounds
         are unarguable to the extent that they assert that a decision would
         be 'not in accordance with  the  law'  under  Article  8.2  if  the
         Appellant met the requirements of paragraph  41.   Nevertheless  if
         the point in (2) [in the grounds of onward appeal]  is  established
         this may well affect  the  sustainability  of  any  decision  under
         Article 8."

10.  Paragraph 2 of the grounds had summarised  the  decision  of  R  (Iran)
    [2005] EWCA Civ 982 on the circumstances when an  error  of  law  could
    arise. This could include making perverse or irrational findings  on  a
    material matter, failing to give adequate reasons  for  such  findings,
    failing to take into account and resolve conflicts of fact or  opinion,
    giving weight to immaterial matters or making a  material  misdirection
    of law on  any  material  matter,  committing  a  procedural  or  other
    irregularity capable of making a material difference to the outcome  or
    the fairness of the  proceedings  and/or  making  a  mistake  as  to  a
    material fact which could be established by objective and uncontentious
    evidence where the appellant and/or his advisors were  not  responsible
    for the mistake and where unfairness resulted  from  the  fact  that  a
    mistake was made.

11.  The Respondent replied to the grant of permission  by  a  letter  dated
    20th August  2015  stating  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
    directed himself appropriately.  The Respondent pointed  out  that  the
    grounds of onward appeal had not specified what  the  contents  of  the
    Sponsor's witness statement were or how they went to  establish  family
    life between the siblings.  It was highly  unlikely  that  the  parties
    could demonstrate family life in the first place something which had to
    be established before even considering whether the Rules  were  met  as
    part of the proportionality exercise.   The  grounds  cited  the  Upper
    Tribunal decision in Mostafa [2015] UKUT 112:

         "We are however prepared to say  that  it  will  only  be  in  very
         unusual circumstances that a person other  than  a  close  relative
         will be able to show that the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  comes
         within the scope of Article  8(1).   In  practical  terms  this  is
         likely to be limited to cases where the  relationship  is  that  of
         husband and wife or other close life partners or a parent and minor
         child and even then it will not necessarily be  extended  to  cases
         where, for example, the proposed visit is based on a whim  or  will
         not add significantly to the time that the  people  involved  spend
         together".

The Hearing before Me

12.  In consequence of the grant of permission the matter came before me  to
    determine in the first place whether there was an error of law  in  the
    determination at first instance such that it fell to be set  aside  and
    the matter reheard.  If there was not then the decision of  the  First-
    tier would stand. In submissions for the Appellant Mr  Ruano  (who  had
    drafted the grounds of onward appeal) relied on his  grounds  (which  I
    have summarised above).  The main issue was  that  the  Judge  had  not
    considered the Sponsor's witness statement and that was a  clear  error
    of law.  The question was the materiality of that error and whether  it
    was significant enough to merit a reconsideration.  The Judge  was  not
    bound to accept the statement but he did have to deal with it.  If  the
    Upper Tribunal agreed with that submission the case should be  remitted
    back to the First-tier Tribunal to be decided afresh.

13.  The Respondent had raised the case of  Mostafa  in  her  reply  to  the
    grant suggesting that  the  family  relationship  between  brother  and
    sister was not one which was close enough to engage Article 8 for these
    purposes.  However Mostafa had said that such cases were fact-sensitive
    and one had to look at the individual merits of  the  case.   The  next
    closest to a husband and wife or parent and child was a relationship of
    adult siblings.  That was close enough of a relationship for the  error
    made by the Judge  (not  considering  the  evidence  in  the  Sponsor's
    statement) to be material.

14.  In response the Presenting Officer relied on the Rule 24  reply.   Even
    if the Judge had made an explicit reference to the Sponsor's  statement
    it would have not made any difference to the outcome  of  this  appeal.
    In fact when one  looked  at  paragraph  4  of  the  Sponsor's  witness
    statement which stated that she received 10,000 rupees per  month  from
    rent from her property  that  did  not  address  the  concerns  of  the
    Respondent because the increase in the Appellant's bank  statement  had
    been of the order of 100,000 Pakistan rupees in less than three months.
     The statement had not addressed the concern of  the  ECO  why  such  a
    significant increase in the Appellant's bank  statement  had  occurred.
    The Appellant had stated in her application form at  question  57  that
    she had no savings but that was inconsistent with  the  explanation  of
    the Sponsor.

15.  The Sponsor failed to provide an accurate or detailed  account  of  his
    outgoings in his statement.  Reliance on the statement would have  made
    no difference to the outcome of the appeal.  In any event the Appellant
    had to demonstrate the existence of family life between adult relatives
    which amounted to more than normal emotional  ties  and  there  was  no
    evidence of such ties.  Mostafa was authority for the proposition  that
    refusal would come within the scope of Article 8 but this case was  far
    removed from Mostafa which was a husband and wife case.  There  was  no
    error of law in the determination.

16.  In conclusion the Appellant's representative argued that  the  test  in
    Kugathas of a family relationship between adults  involving  more  than
    normal emotional ties was relevant to  cases  involving  settlement  as
    opposed to this case which was about a visit for which there was only a
    limited amount of time.  It was not  necessary  for  the  Appellant  to
    demonstrate more than emotional ties.

Findings

17.  There is no right of appeal as such against a decision to refuse  entry
    clearance as a visitor under paragraph 41  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    What the Appellant has to show is that the refusal of  entry  clearance
    breaches this country's obligations under Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention.  The alternative ground that the  Race  Relations  Act  has
    been breached is not relevant to this case.

18.  What is relevant to consider is whether  the  Appellant  can  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 41.  If she cannot that  of  itself  must  be
    taken into account should the case reach as far as the  proportionality
    exercise under Article 8.  The Judge found as a fact that the Appellant
    could not meet the requirements of paragraph 41 although it is fair  to
    say that his treatment of that issue was brief.  The Judge  upheld  the
    Respondent's concern as to the origin of the funds in  the  Appellant's
    bank account stating that the Appellant had not properly explained  the
    origin of those funds.

19.  Whilst it is correct that the Judge does not  in  terms  refer  to  the
    Sponsor's statement, as was submitted to me in argument  the  Sponsor's
    statement does not address that concern raised by the Respondent in the
    notice of refusal.  Thus even if the Judge was arguably wrong in law to
    fail to  refer  to  the  Sponsor's  statement,  that  failure  made  no
    difference to the outcome of the  case  since  there  was  no  evidence
    before the Judge which met the objection raised by the Respondent  that
    the Appellant's account had unexplained finances.  The rental of 10,000
    Pakistan rupees per month referred to  by  the  Sponsor  was  evidently
    considered inadequate to explain the very large amounts paid  into  the
    Appellant's account shortly before she made her application  for  entry
    clearance.  This had prompted  the  Respondent  to  doubt  whether  the
    Appellant had the intention to return to Pakistan at  the  end  of  the
    visit.  A failure to demonstrate that intention would lead to a failure
    to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 41 of the Rules.

20.  The Judge had stated at paragraph  11  of  his  determination  that  he
    could not accept the financial documents before him from the  Appellant
    as they had failed to satisfy him that they were a  true  and  accurate
    reflection of her financial circumstances.  The essential point in this
    case was that the Appellant could not demonstrate any significant  ties
    to Pakistan that would act as any form of incentive upon her to  return
    to Pakistan at the end of  the  visit.  By  rejecting  the  Appellant's
    financial circumstances the Judge impliedly accepted that objection  of
    the Respondent. He was entitled therefore to  come  to  the  conclusion
    that the Appellant could  not  satisfy  paragraph  41.  The  Judge  was
    satisfied that the Sponsor could adequately  maintain  and  accommodate
    having perused the Sponsor's bank statements but was not  satisfied  as
    he needed to be that the Appellant was giving him an  accurate  account
    of her own situation.

21.  There is no appeal as such from  a  refusal  under  paragraph  41,  the
    appeal must be on the basis that the decision breaches Article 8.  Thus
    it is not of itself fatal to an appeal that the Appellant  cannot  meet
    paragraph 41 but that failure has to be taken into account if and  when
    the case reaches the proportionality stage. The  Respondent's  argument
    is that it is not necessary to get as far as the proportionality  stage
    since there is no family life which is being  interfered  with  by  the
    Respondent's decision.  What there is  is  the  relationship  of  adult
    siblings, a brother and sister.  The Judge did not find that there  was
    a family life capable of being interfered with in such a way as to give
    rise to a potential breach of  Article  8,  see  paragraph  15  of  the
    determination where the Judge states: "I am not satisfied that there is
    an arguable case to be made for consideration outside of the Rules".

22.  Nevertheless the Judge went on to consider  the  case  on  an  even  if
    basis.  Even if the Appellant could show there was family life that was
    interfered with by the Respondent's  decision,  that  decision  was  in
    accordance with the legitimate  aim  of  immigration  control  and  was
    proportionate to that aim for the reasons he  gave  and  which  I  have
    summarised above. The Appellant's counter argument in the case is  that
    the proportionality exercise is not reached because the legitimate  aim
    is not made out although it has to be said that this argument  made  in
    the grounds of onward appeal is somewhat short of reasoning.

23.  Even if the Appellant could demonstrate that  the  relationship  of  an
    adult brother and sister came within Article 8(1), there  could  be  no
    doubt that refusal  of  entry  clearance  in  circumstances  where  the
    Appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules must by
    definition be in accordance with  the  legitimate  aim  of  immigration
    control.

24.  Even if the Appellant's argument that  it  is  not  necessary  for  the
    Appellant and Sponsor to  show  more  than  normal  emotional  ties  is
    correct (and I have grave doubts  on  that  score)  one  still  has  to
    consider the issue  of  proportionality.   The  Judge  found  that  the
    Appellant could  not  meet  the  Immigration  Rules.   There  was  thus
    considerable weight to be  placed  on  the  Respondent's  side  of  the
    scales.  The Judge found as a fact that it was possible for the Sponsor
    to travel to Pakistan to meet the Appellant and that as the rupture  in
    the family had been caused by the decision of the Appellant and Sponsor
    to live in two separate countries, any interference was  proportionate.
    The Sponsor's argument in his statement that it would be difficult  for
    him in the United Kingdom to travel to Pakistan  with  all  his  family
    does not raise any arguable issue as to  why  in  reality  the  Sponsor
    cannot travel to Pakistan to  meet  the  Appellant  if  they  so  wish.
    Whether the Sponsor chooses to take other family members  with  him  or
    not is a matter for him.

25.  The Judge was quite right in his conclusion  that  there  would  be  no
    breach of Article 8 because  the  Respondent's  decision  was  entirely
    proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued.  As I have indicated
    I do not consider that  the  case  reaches  the  proportionality  stage
    because I find that the Judge was right when he said that the Appellant
    and Sponsor cannot demonstrate a family life that is  being  interfered
    with by the  decision.   They  are  adult  siblings  and  there  is  no
    suggestion that their relationship is more than normal emotional  ties.
    I reject the argument that it  is  not  necessary  to  show  more  than
    emotional ties on a visit appeal as opposed  to  a  settlement  appeal.
    Both a visit appeal and a settlement appeal when raising Article 8 must
    satisfy the same criteria.  It is not difficult to show  the  existence
    of family life, the courts have said that is not  a  particularly  high
    threshold to cross, but what must be shown before an  interference  can
    be demonstrated is that that family life consists of more  than  normal
    emotional ties and this the Appellant cannot  show.   Thus  the  appeal
    fails not only because of the  Kugathas  point  but  also  because  the
    weight to  be  attached  to  the  Respondent's  decision  significantly
    outweighs any interference  there  might  be  with  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor's family life and/or the Appellant's private life.   The  Judge
    did not make an  error  of  law  and  gave  adequate  reasons  for  his
    conclusions. I uphold his decision to dismiss the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I dismiss the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  First-tier
Tribunal decision.

Appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
