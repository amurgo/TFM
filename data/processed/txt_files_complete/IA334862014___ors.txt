Representation:

For the Appellants:    Miss D Ofei-Kwatia instructed by
For the Respondents:   Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellants are mother, father and their three children born  on  5
      August 2005, 14 May 2007 and 7 April 2012.  They  appeal  against  the
      decision of the Secretary of State, who on 6  August  2014  considered
      their claims under Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
      Rights both within and outside the Immigration Rules.  In  respect  of
      the first and second Appellants consideration was given to the partner
      route and the parent route and the Secretary of State  concluded  that
      the requirements of neither route was met. The Secretary of State then
      went on to consider  the  first  and  second  Appellants'  case  under
      paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Rules and concluded  that  they  could  not
      meet the requirements in terms of the length of residence and had  not
      demonstrated that there were very significant obstacles to integration
      into Nigeria.




   2. The applications of the three children were considered under the child
      route and a decision was taken in relation to their private life under
      paragraph 276ADE.  The Secretary of State also concluded that they did
      not meet the requirements of leave to enter under the child route  and
      that  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE  (iv)  were  not   met.
      Consideration was also given as  to  whether  there  were  exceptional
      circumstances which would mean removal was inappropriate  and  it  was
      concluded that there were not. The Secretary of State also  considered
      s55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and concluded
      that the family could return to  Nigeria  together  and  the  children
      could be educated there.




   3. The Appellants appealed against that decision and in  a  determination
      dated 5 February 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge  Sweet  allowed  their
      appeals. The first and second Appellants had been in the UK  illegally
      since 2006.  The third, fourth and fifth Appellants were 9, 7 and 2 at
      the date of the hearing and were all born here. At paragraph 29 of the
      decision the First-tier Tribunal  found  that  in  the  light  of  the
      evidence provided, both oral and documentary, the third Appellant  met
      the requirements of paragraph 276ADE (iv) and  the  first  and  second
      Appellants met the requirements of paragraph 276ADE (vi).




   4. Permission to appeal was  granted  on  16  April  2015  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge De Haney.  Permission was granted on the basis that the
      First-tier Tribunal's bare assertion  at  paragraph  29  that  he  was
      satisfied that the Appellants could meet the requirements of paragraph
      276ADE was arguably inadequate to explain to the parties why  one  had
      won and the other had lost the appeal.  He found  that  there  was  an
      arguable error of law.




   5. At a hearing on 8 September I concluded  that  there  was  a  material
      error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.   The  First-
      tier Tribunal referred to  the  requirements  of  Section  55  of  the
      Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and stated that  he  did
      not consider that it  would  be  appropriate  for  the  family  to  be
      separated and concluded that it would not be reasonable  for  them  to
      return to Nigeria where there were  "significant  obstacles  in  their
      integrating into Nigerian society".  There were no reasons  given  for
      this  conclusion.   The  short  determination  disclosed  no  findings
      justifying  his  conclusion  that  there  would  be  very  significant
      obstacles to the  Appellants  integrating  into  Nigerian  society  or
      indeed the reasonableness of  expecting  the  children  to  return  to
      Nigeria. There were no findings in  relation  to  the  extent  of  the
      Appellants' integration into the UK or the extent  of  their  ties  to
      Nigeria.




   6. I determined that the appeals should be reheard in the Upper Tribunal.



Evidence and Submissions

   7. In the light of the fact that the eldest child had  become  a  British
      Citizen  on  7  December  2015   I   heard   submissions   from   both
      representatives as to how to proceed. Mr Melvin relied on MK  (section
      55 -  Tribunal  options)  Sierra  Leone  [2015]  UKUT  223  (IAC)  and
      submitted that in the light of the change of  circumstances,  remittal
      to the Secretary of State for reconsideration and a fresh decision was
      appropriate. Ms Ofei-Kwatia submitted that the citizenship was  not  a
      surprise to the Respondent. The application was made in 2012 and there
      would be further delay if the matter was remitted.  She submitted that
      there was sufficient material before the Tribunal to make  a  decision
      on the best interests of the children. I  was  satisfied  that  I  was
      sufficiently equipped on the evidence before me to  make  an  adequate
      assessment of the best interests of the children.




   8. The First Appellant adopted her witness statement  before  the  First-
      tier Tribunal.  She said that  she  was  happy  to  be  here  and  the
      children had family and friends here and enjoyed activities.  If  they
      had to return to Nigeria they would have no  money  for  school  fees,
      food and accommodation as they did not have any support.  Her  mother,
      father and older sister were there. Her partner had his mum,  dad  and
      one brother and one sister. She was living with her parents  prior  to
      coming to the UK. He rented an apartment. Her parents were  not  happy
      with her because she was pregnant out of wedlock.  She  would  not  be
      able to live with her partner's parents because they did not want  him
      to marry her. She had no savings or assets. Her son was in year  6  at
      primary school. Her second child was in year 4.




   9. Mr Melvin asked if there was anything preventing her return. She  said
      her parents were preventing her. She had a Nigerian passport and  came
      to the UK aged 26. She  left  school  in  2005  and  did  not  have  a
      University education. She was in school until she was 25. She  started
      late and had never had a job. She had a secondary school  certificate.
      Whilst in the UK she went to people's houses to do hair. She could not
      be a hair stylist in Nigeria because if you did  not  have  money  you
      could not do business.  You had to do hair in salons. If she  went  to
      University she could get another job. Her parents  could  not  support
      her. They had not talked to her. There  was  no  one  to  sponsor  her
      through university. Her partner worked for a construction company  for
      three years in Nigeria. Since 2005 her family had not  wanted  her  in
      Nigeria. She had not married as they  had  no  parental  support.  Her
      family wanted her to abort the pregnancy and since then she  had  been
      staying here. They did not go elsewhere in Nigeria  because  they  did
      not know anybody there. She did not  get  a  house  with  her  partner
      because he was not making money.




  10. They waited until they had children before trying to regularise  their
      stay because a lot of people told them to do nothing and she was  told
      after 7 years she could apply. Her uncle took her to a lawyer. He said
      you have to wait for seven years. She made no attempt to  contact  the
      authorities for 7 years. She had children at  NHS  hospitals  and  put
      children  into  government  schools.  She  had  not  applied  for  any
      benefits. Her financial support came from her uncle and the little job
      she was doing.  She  did  not  live  with  her  uncle  and  rented  an
      apartment. Her uncle gave them ï¿½350 every month and she had money from
      her job. Her partner  cleaned  houses  and  ironed.  He  did  not  pay
      national insurance or tax.  Mr Melvin asked if it would it be fair  to
      say that she had deliberately avoided UK authorities and was using her
      children to make a claim to remain in the UK. She said it was not true
      because she didn't know how this system worked. When her son was 6 her
      uncle took her to a lawyer. He said wait for seven years.




  11. There were state schools in Nigeria. The main language  and  education
      system was English. State education was free. You had to buy books. In
      re-examination she said that she started school at  7  years  old  and
      remained in school until the age of 25 because she repeated 3  classes
      twice.  She was not allowed to enter into a customary marriage without
      consent. She  was  not  in  contact  with  her  siblings.  Her  sister
      supported her parents and husband's family and did  not  want  him  to
      marry her.




  12. I asked why her uncle could not send ï¿½350 to  Nigeria.  She  said  her
      uncle wanted her to settle with her parents. He did not agree with her
      parents but her parents did not listen. He gave her money here because
      he saw her struggling. If she went back it might stop.




  13. Mr Melvin asked if her uncle spoke regularly to  her  mother  and  she
      said he did. He was not here today because the lawyer did not tell her
      to bring him today. She had her auntie and her father's sister in  the
      UK.




  14. The second Appellant adopted his witness statement. He said  that  his
      eldest son was doing well here and had lots of  friends.  He  did  not
      have recourse to public funds. He had been paying  Council  tax  since
      2006/2008.




  15. Mr Melvin asked if there was a record of him arriving legally. He said
      that he submitted records to the Home Office. There was a photocopy of
      a visa page. He was visiting his aunt and his partner in  the  UK  who
      had given birth. The visa said he was visiting  his  aunt  and  uncle.
      His aunt was younger sister to his mum and  his  uncle  was  from  his
      dad's family. When the visa expired there were complications with  the
      birth and she needed someone to look after her. They  were  relatively
      new and did not know they could go to someone else. They needed money.
      They waited for seven years because they had  no  funds  to  make  the
      application. In Nigeria he had worked in an  engineering  company  for
      about 2 years. He was 31 when he came to the UK. He  was  23  when  he
      left school. He had to repeat a few years.  He  was  not  a  qualified
      engineer. He lived in Lagos State by himself.  She  was  28  when  she
      became pregnant and a student. She had not moved him with him  because
      it was a taboo because they were not married.  They were  Muslim.  Her
      parents did not bless the relationship. He was not  financially  in  a
      good position.




  16. Since 2006 he had worked here for friends  and  family  and  not  paid
      national insurance or tax. He had supported  himself  cleaning  houses
      and friends and family support them. An uncle  helped  them  and  gave
      them ï¿½350 a month. He would not be able to provide that if  they  went
      back because he took on the responsibility. He would not  be  able  to
      put up that kind of money. If they went back he  would  consider  that
      the first Appellant was her mum  and  dad's  responsibility.  If  they
      returned he would become destitute and would  be  unable  to  pay  for
      school fees. Lots of people didn't have a job and they had no contacts
      in terms of employment and it would take more than two years to get  a
      job.  He had his mum, dad and two younger  siblings.  They  could  not
      help. Education was free but there were additional costs.  They  would
      not have the money for schooling. There were opportunities for work.




  17. Mr Melvin relied on the refusal letter of August 2014 and his  written
      submissions. In respect of the oral evidence given by the  parents  of
      the children, he did not accept that both parents repeated  six  years
      of education. Both were working in Nigeria when they  entered  the  UK
      and he did not accept that the second Appellant entered legally. There
      was no evidence. He did not accept that the uncle who  supported  them
      here would not do so were they to return to Nigeria. It was clear that
      the evidence was that they were waiting until one of the children  was
      7 years old and could use this to make an application under the Rules.
      He did not accept that it was due  to  ignorance.  There  were  family
      members that could have assisted with an  application.  It  was  clear
      that the whole reason for  making  the  application  was  to  use  the
      children to allow them leave to remain. Section 55  was  addressed  in
      the skeleton argument. The case law showed it was in the best interest
      to remain with both parents.




  18. He did not accept that they could not work in Nigeria. There had  been
      past work and it was the responsibility of parents to look after their
      children and he did not accept that there would be destitution.  There
      was clear evidence of contact with siblings in  Nigeria.  It  was  not
      credible that they would hold such a grudge for approaching  a  decade
      and deny themselves opportunity to be part  of  their  grandchildren's
      lives. The claim of lack of contact was there to assist the Appellants
      in showing that they had nothing to return to in Nigeria. There  would
      be education for the children  in  Nigeria.  There  was  no  objective
      evidence to show they would not be education. The  schools  were  free
      and education was in English. He accepted that the children  had  made
      friends in the UK they were primary school children and would  not  be
      seen to making relationships outside the family from the age of 11. He
      accepted that the eldest child was a British Citizen and second  child
      had been here over 7 years and therefore met the requirements  of  276
      ADE (iv) in terms of length of residence. Children were adaptable  and
      as a British Citizen did not have to remain here. They  travelled  all
      over the world to be with parents and could be educated in  UK.  There
      were other family members in the UK and the British Citizen could stay
      with them. It was a ridiculous situation to piggy back on their rights
      when no other family member had the right to  be  here.  The  children
      were Nigerian citizens as well as the parents and dual nationals. They
      had not reached a stage in their education which was disruptive.  They
      had also been brought up by Nigerian parents amongst Nigerian  people.
      The Appellant confirmed that the Nigerian family in  the  UK  were  of
      Nigerian descent. The children were being denied rich culture of being
      brought up of Nigeria. When looking at the  proportionality  issue  it
      had to be taken into account that the  parents  were  overstaying  and
      only making application when they could. The  inability  to  remove  a
      British Citizen should not mean  that  other  appeals  should  not  be
      dismissed.




  19. Ms Ofei-Kwatia submitted that on  the  whole  the  evidence  had  been
      consistent.   There was no benefit to Appellants in  not  telling  the
      truth about repeating years of their education. The  second  Appellant
      did not know why the first Appellant was studying. He was working.  In
      relation to his entry into the UK, a copy of his  visit  visa  was  at
      p173. The immigration history was irrefutable. At the point  at  which
      the eldest child turned six the uncle took them to a lawyer  who  then
      advised. At that end of the day there were policies which people could
      benefit from. The parents had not accepted  the  relationship  between
      the first and second Appellants. She relied on the skeleton  argument.
      In relation to Article 8 and  s55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
      Immigration Act  2009  and  Sanade  and  others  (British  children  -
      Zambrano - Derici) [2012] UKUT 00048, it  was  beyond  the  bounds  of
      reason that the Respondent  said  it  was  reasonable  to  remove  the
      family.  It would be a de facto  removal  and  the  third  Appellant's
      rights would be truncated.  It  did  not  fall  within  the  statutory
      framework. Every stage of education was important.  S117B  (6)  stated
      that the public interest did  not  require  the  removal  of  the  two
      qualifying children. One was a British Citizen and the other  one  had
      been here for 7 years. In Sanade the Respondent  conceded  that  where
      there is a child who has citizenship it  is  not  reasonable  for  the
      family to leave. S117B (6) was a stand-alone provision, and the public
      interest did not require removal. This had been held in Treebhawon and
      others s117 B (6) UKUT 00674 which was emphatic about s117 B (6).




  20. Mr Melvin said that the Respondent withdrew the concession in  Sanade.
      Ms Ofei-Kwatia said that the principles in Zambrano were unaffected.




  21. I reserved my decision.

Discussion and Findings

  22. I have considered the skeleton arguments of both  representatives  and
      all the evidence  submitted  by  both  parties  before  coming  to  my
      conclusions in this appeal. The Appellants do not claim  to  meet  the
      requirements of the partner, parent or child routes of Appendix FM  of
      the Immigration Rules. The first two Appellants contend that they meet
      the requirements of paragraph 276 ADE (1)  (vi)  and  the  fourth  and
      fifth Appellant contend that they meet the requirements  of  paragraph
      276 ADE (1) (iv). The third Appellant  was  registered  as  a  British
      Citizen on 7 December 2015 and so has the right of  abode  in  the  UK
      under section 1 (1) of the Immigration Act 1971 and cannot be  removed
      from the UK. It follows that his appeal must be allowed.






The First Appellant

  23.  According to  the  Respondent's  records  of  the  first  Appellant's
      immigration history she entered the UK on 19 October 2005  with  entry
      clearance as a visitor until 19 October 2006 and overstayed her leave.
      However, she must have been in the UK before then as her  first  child
      was born here in August 2005. She applied for leave  to  remain  under
      the Human Rights Act on 28  August  2012.  According  to  Mr  Melvin's
      skeleton argument that application was refused with no right of appeal
      but there were judicial review proceedings which led to the Respondent
      reconsidering the applications leading to the decision to refuse on  6
      August 2014 which is the subject of the current appeals.




  24. The requirements of paragraph 276ADE are to be considered at the  date
      of the application. The Respondent treated the date of the application
      as the date of the reconsideration in the refusal letter of  6  August
      2014.  I do not have the documentation relating to the judicial review
      proceedings before me and it is unclear what occurred. In view of  the
      fact that there has been no objection by the  Appellants  to  treating
      the relevant date for the consideration of Rule 276ADE as the date  of
      the reconsideration I do so too.




  25. At the date of the reconsideration the first Appellant  was  34  years
      old. She had spent the first 26 years of her life  living  in  Nigeria
      and it is accepted that she cannot meet the requirements of  paragraph
      276ADE(1)(iii) and (v). She is therefore required to demonstrate  that
      there would be very significant  obstacles  to  her  integration  into
      Nigeria (paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)). In her witness  statement  dated  4
      November 2014 at page 6 of the Appellant's bundle she states that  her
      parents threatened to disown her because she became  pregnant  out  of
      wedlock and she fled the country. She states that she has  not  spoken
      to her parents since then. She further states that she has no home  or
      job to return to in Nigeria and she and her family would  be  rendered
      destitute. She would have no money to provide  education  and  medical
      care for her family. She also  asserts  that  her  daughter  would  be
      subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) by her partner's family.




  26. The First-tier Tribunal made no findings of fact in  relation  to  the
      ability of the first Appellant to integrate into Nigeria save that  he
      found her evidence that her daughter would be at risk of FGM  was  not
      credible.  I found that there was  an  error  of  law  in  failing  to
      provide reasons for  the  findings  under  paragraph  276ADE  but  the
      finding in relation to credibility is not disturbed and stands.




  27. I do not accept that there would be very significant obstacles to  her
      integration. Having spent most of her  life  in  Nigeria  she  retains
      linguistic and cultural links. She has friends and relatives here  who
      are part of the Nigerian diaspora and has remained within the Nigerian
      community. I find that she would not be without funds and destitute in
      Nigeria. I found that the Appellant gave no persuasive explanation  as
      to why her uncle who has provided her  with  ï¿½350  a  month  would  be
      unwilling to send her money in order to re-establish herself. I do not
      accept that he would cease to want to help her  on  return.  She  also
      states in her witness statement that she enjoys family life in the  UK
      with extended family members including cousins, aunties and uncles.  I
      find it unlikely that were the Appellant removed to Nigeria they would
      allow her to be destitute. Further, I do not accept that she would  be
      unable to find some form  of  employment  in  Nigeria.  There  was  no
      objective evidence  to  support  her  claim  that  someone  without  a
      university education would be unable to find a job or that  she  could
      not use her hairdressing skills to find paid  work.  Whilst  I  accept
      that her family may not approve of her relationship with her  partner,
      I find that she would not be at risk as a  result  and  it  would  not
      impede her ability to reintegrate into Nigerian society generally.

   The Second Appellant

  28. The second Appellant claims  to  have  arrived  as  a  visitor  on  12
      February 2006. The Respondent claims that there is no evidence of  his
      lawful entry. However, he has submitted a copy of his  visit  visa  in
      his passport at page 173 of the Appellant's  bundle.  The  visa  shows
      that he was granted entry from 20 December 2005 to 20  June  2006.  It
      does not appear that the Respondent has checked whether it was validly
      issued. In any event, there is no assertion it is a false document.




  29. His witness statement is at page  8  of  the  Appellant's  bundle.  He
      states that due to the first Appellant's pregnancy he  was  threatened
      with arrest and had to run away.  His  parents  warned  him  not  have
      anything to do with his wife because she is from Abeokuto. He  further
      states that he has no home or job to return to in  Nigeria  and  would
      not be able to provide for his family. He asserts  that  he  would  be
      destitute on return and his  wife  and  children  would  suffer  as  a
      result. He would have no money to  provide  for  their  education  and
      medical care. He also asserts that his daughter would  be  subject  to
      FGM.




  30. I find that the second Appellant has not demonstrated that there would
      be very significant obstacles to his integration. At the time  of  the
      reconsideration he was aged 39 and was 31 when he arrived in  the  UK.
      He has linguistic and cultural ties to Nigeria. He had employment  and
      accommodation in Nigeria prior to leaving and I do not accept that  he
      would  be  unable  to  find  employment  on  return.  He  provided  no
      supporting  evidence  to  show  that  he  had  approached  prospective
      employers and applied for and  had  been  refused  jobs  or  objective
      evidence to show that the employment situation is such that  he  would
      not be employed on return. Further, for the  reasons  given  above,  I
      find that it is unlikely that the support  from  the  UK  uncle  would
      cease on their departure from the UK. The First-tier tribunal did  not
      find that the Appellant's claim that his daughter would be subject  to
      FGM was credible and that finding stands. Whilst  I  accept  that  the
      first Appellant's family may not approve of the relationship I do  not
      find that this would impede his reintegration into Nigeria.




      The Fourth Appellant

  31.   The  fourth  Appellant  was  7  years  old  at  the  date   of   the
      reconsideration and was born in the UK. He is  therefore  required  to
      demonstrate that it would not be reasonable to expect him to leave the
      UK (paragraph 276 ADE (iv)). There is evidence from pages 174  to  213
      in the Appellant's bundle supporting his claim to have  established  a
      private life in the United Kingdom. There are letters  in  respect  of
      his school attendance and photographs of the  family  in  the  UK.  In
      assessing whether it would be reasonable for him to  leave  the  UK  I
      have had regard to his best interests as a primary  consideration  (ZH
      (Tanzania)  (FC)  (Appellant)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department (Respondent) [2011] UKSC 4).




  32. The best interests of the child broadly describes his  well-being.  of
      EV (Philippines) and Others [2014] EWCA Civ 874 the  Court  of  Appeal
      stated that the best interests of children will depend on a number  of
      factors including their age, the length of time that they have been in
      the United Kingdom, how long they have been in  education,  the  stage
      that their education has  reached,  to  what  extent  they  have  been
      distanced from the country to which  they  are  to  be  returned,  how
      renewable their connection with it may be, the extent that  they  will
      have linguistic, medical or other difficulties  in  adapting  to  life
      there and the extent to which the course proposed will interfere  with
      their family life or other rights in this country. In Azimi-Moayed and
      others (decisions affecting children; onward appeals  appeals)  [2013]
      UKUT 197(IAC) the Tribunal held that: (a) As a starting point it is in
      the best interests of children to be with both their  parents  and  if
      both parents are being  removed  from  the  United  Kingdom  then  the
      starting point suggests that so should  dependent  children  who  form
      part of their household unless there are reasons to the contrary; (ii)
      It is generally in the interests of children to  have  both  stability
      and continuity of social and educational provision and the benefit  of
      growing up in the cultural norms of the society to which they  belong;
      (iii) Lengthy residence in a country other than the  state  of  origin
      can lead to development of social cultural and educational  ties  that
      it would be inappropriate to disrupt, in  the  absence  of  compelling
      reason to the contrary. What amounts to lengthy residence is not clear
      cut but past and present policies have identified  seven  years  as  a
      relevant period; (iv)  Apart from the terms of published policies  and
      rules, the Tribunal notes that seven years from age four is likely  to
      be more significant to a child that the first  seven  years  of  life.
      Very young children are focussed on their parents  rather  than  their
      peers and are adaptable; (v) Short periods of residence,  particularly
      ones without leave or the reasonable expectation of leave to enter  or
      remain, while claims are promptly considered,  are  unlikely  to  give
      rise  to  private  life  deserving  of  respect  in  the  absence   of
      exceptional factors.




  33. The best interests of the fourth Appellant  are  to  remain  with  his
      parents who do not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  He
      is of an age where he may have  started  to  develop  a  private  life
      outside his nuclear family with friends at school but  is  still  very
      young and adaptable. His parents have, I have found, not  demonstrated
      that there would be very significant obstacles to  their  integration.
      Education in Nigeria is free and the Appellant has  grown  up  amongst
      Nigerian relatives and friends in the UK. It has not been argued  that
      these relationships amount to family life for the purposes of  Article
      8 ECHR. These relationships provide a link to the culture of  Nigeria.
      In the light of my findings in  relation  to  his  parents  I  do  not
      consider that the fourth Appellant would face destitution or  hardship
      on return to Nigeria.  I find that his  parents  would  be  likely  to
      support him adequately. His  education  has  not  reached  a  critical
      stage. He is of an age where he is likely to be able to  make  friends
      quickly. I also consider that in the  light  of  his  parent's  strong
      connection to Nigeria he would be  able  to  integrate  into  Nigerian
      society. In all the circumstances I find that it would  be  reasonable
      within the context of the Immigration Rules for him to expect  him  to
      leave the UK.

   The Fifth Appellant

  34.   The  fifth  Appellant  was  2  years  old  at  the   date   of   the
      reconsideration. It follows from the case law cited above that she was
      too young to have established a private life outside the home and that
      her focus will be on her parents. In the light of my findings above in
      relation to her parent's ability to integrate and her young age I find
      that it would be reasonable within  the  context  of  the  Immigration
      Rules to expect her to leave the UK.

   Article 8 ECHR

  35. A two-stage approach with regard to Article 8 has been approved by the
      Court of Appeal in a number of cases including Singh and Khalid v SSHD
      [2015] EWCA Civ  72.  The  decision-maker  should  adopt  a  two-stage
      process.  The first question is whether  the  individual  can  succeed
      under the Rules and the second is, if  not,  can  he  or  she  succeed
      outside the Rules under Art 8. There is no  threshold  requirement  of
      arguability before a decision maker reaches the second stage. However,
      the extent of any consideration outside the  Rules  will  depend  upon
      whether all the issues have been adequately addressed under the Rules.
       In Singh and Khalid the Court of  Appeal  opined  at  paragraph  [64]
      "there is no need to conduct a full  separate  examination  of  Art  8
      outside the Rules where, in the circumstances of  a  particular  case,
      all the issues have been addressed  in  the  consideration  under  the
      Rules."




  36. In SS (Congo) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at paragraph [3]2  the  Court
      of Appeal clarified the relationship between the Immigration Rules and
      the public interest considerations:


      "However, even away from those contexts, if the Secretary of State has
      sought to formulate Immigration Rules to reflect  a  fair  balance  of
      interests under Article 8 in the general run of cases  falling  within
      their scope, then, as  explained  above,  the  Rules  themselves  will
      provide  significant  evidence  about  the  relevant  public  interest
      considerations which should be brought into account when  a  court  or
      tribunal seeks to strike the proper balance of interests under Article
      8 in making its own decision. As Beatson LJ observed in Haleemudeen  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 558; [2014]
      Imm AR 6, at [40], the new Rules in Appendix FM:
      "... are a central part of the legislative and policy context in which
      the  interests  of  immigration  control  are  balanced  against   the
      interests and rights of people who have come to this country and  wish
      to settle in it. Overall, the Secretary of State's policy as  to  when
      an  interference  with  an  Article  8  right  will  be  regarded   as
      disproportionate is more particularised in the new Rules than  it  had
      previously been."


      Accordingly, a court or tribunal is required to  give  the  new  Rules
      "greater weight than as merely a starting point for the  consideration
      of the proportionality of  an  interference  with  Article  8  rights"
      (para. [47])."


  37. Whilst there is no intermediate  test  it  is  important  to  consider
      whether all issues have been addressed under the Rules in this case. I
      find that they have not. The third Appellant became a British  Citizen
      on and cannot be removed from the UK. Clearly, the  Immigration  Rules
      no longer apply to him but since he is affected  by  the  Respondent's
      decision in respect of the remainder of his family I have to  consider
      his Article 8 rights. His British Citizenship affects the question  of
      whether it is reasonable for the  family  as  a  whole  to  return  to
      Nigeria. As this is an in-country appeal, the circumstances relied  on
      by the Appellants in relation  to  the  Article  8  claim  are  to  be
      considered at the date of the hearing.




  38. In Omotunde (best interests  -  Zambrano  applied  -  Razgar)  Nigeria
      [2011] UKUT 00247(IAC) the Upper Tribunal held that:

1.    When applying the judgment of the Court of  Justice  of  the  European
    Union in Ruiz Zambrano (European citizenship) [2011] EUECJ Case C-34/09
    OJ 2011 C130/2 and that of the Supreme Court in  ZH  (Tanzania)  [2011]
    UKSC 4; [2011] 2 WLR 148, in relation to the  proposed  administrative
    removal or deportation of one or both of his non-national parents,  the
    welfare of a child, particularly a child who is a British citizen, is a
    primary consideration.
2.     National courts must engage with the question whether  removal  of  a
    particular parent will 'deprive [the child] of the genuine enjoyment of
    the substance of the rights attaching to the status of  European  Union
    citizen'.
3.    Where there are  strong  public  interest  reasons  to  expel  a  non-
    national parent, any right of  residence  for  the  parent  is  not  an
    absolute  one  but  is  subject  to  the  Community  Law  principle  of
    proportionality. There is no substantial difference between  the  human
    rights  based  assessment  of  proportionality  of   any   interference
    considered by Lady Hale in ZH (Tanzania) and the approach  required  by
    Community law.
4.    In this particular context, the Article  8  assessment  questions  set
    out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 should be tailored as follows, placing the
    assessment of necessity where it  most  appropriately  belongs  in  the
    final question dependent on the outcome of proportionality and  a  fair
    balance, rather than as part of the identification  of  the  legitimate
    aim:
         1. Is there family life enjoyed between the appellant and  a  minor
           child that  requires  respect  in  the  context  of  immigration
           decision making?
         2. Would deportation of the parent interfere with the enjoyment  of
           that family life?
         3. Is such an interference in accordance with the law?
         4. Is such an interference in pursuit of a legitimate aim?
         5. Is deportation  necessary,  proportionate  and  a  fair  balance
           between the rights  to  respect  for  the  family  life  of  the
           appellant and the child and the particular  public  interest  in
           question?



  39. In Ruiz Zambrano the Court of  Justice  in  its  ruling  concluded  at
      paragraph 45:




            "Article 20 TFEU  is  to  be  interpreted  as  meaning  that  it
      precludes a Member State from refusing a third country  national  upon
      whom  his  minor  children,  who  are  European  Union  citizens,  are
      dependent, a right of residence in the Member State of  residence  and
      nationality of those children, and  from  refusing  to  grant  a  work
      permit to that third country national, in so  far  as  such  decisions
      deprive those children of the genuine enjoyment of  the  substance  of
      the rights  attaching  to  the  status  of  European  Union  citizen."






  40. In addressing the Razgar questions in this particular  context  it  is
      clear that the third Appellant enjoys family life with his parents and
      siblings and that he has resided in the UK  with  them  for  over  ten
      years since his birth. In  this  period  he  has  established  also  a
      private life outside the home with his friends.




  41. The removal of his parents and  siblings  would  interfere  with  this
      right as he would lose both his parents who are his  only  carers  and
      his siblings. If he were to go to Nigeria he would lose his home,  his
      school, regular contact with his wider family and his friends, and the
      benefit of being brought up in the country of his birth, as a  British
      citizen, with all the benefits which flow from that upbringing.  There
      was no evidence before me that could lead me to  conclude  that  there
      was anyone else in the UK with whom  he  could  reasonably  live.  The
      removal of both parents therefore would deprive  him  of  the  genuine
      enjoyment of the substance of his rights attaching to his status as  a
      European citizen.




  42. The interference is  in  pursuit  of  a  legitimate  aim  because  the
      decision to remove the Appellants is a  measure  reasonably  connected
      with the economic well-being of the country.




  43. The final question therefore is whether the removal of the  Appellants
      is necessary, proportionate and a fair balance between the  rights  to
      respect for the family  life  of  the  Appellants  and  their  British
      Citizen child/citizen and the particular public interest in question.




  44. By virtue of section 117A of the Immigration Act 2014, in  considering
      the public interest question, I must have regard to the considerations
      listed in section 117B.  Subsection  (2)  provides  that  "the  public
      interest question" means the question of whether an interference  with
      a person's right to respect for private and family life  is  justified
      under Article 8(2). The public interest provisions  are  contained  in
      primary legislation and override existing case  law.  Section  117A(3)
      confirms that the Tribunal  is  required  to  carry  out  a  balancing
      exercise.




  45. In Dube (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC) it was held that:


         "1)       Key  features  of  ss.117A-117D   of   the   Nationality,
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 include the following:


             (a) Judges are required statutorily to  take  into  account  a
                  number of enumerated considerations.   Sections  117A-117D
                  are not, therefore, an a la carte menu  of  considerations
                  that it is at the discretion of the judge to apply or  not
                  apply.  Judges are duty-bound  to  'have  regard'  to  the
                  specified considerations.


             (b) These provisions are only expressed as being binding on  a
                  'court or tribunal'.  It may  be  that  the  Secretary  of
                  State  will  consider  it  in  the   interests   of   good
                  administration  and  consistency  of  decision-making   on
                  Article 8 claims at all levels to have express  regard  to
                  ss.117A-117D  considerations  herself,  but  she  is   not
                  directly bound to do so.


             (c) Whilst expressed in mandatory  terms,  the  considerations
                  specified are not expressed as being exhaustive: note  use
                  of  the  phrase  'in   particular'   in   s.117A(2):   'In
                  considering the public interest  question,  the  court  or
                  tribunal must (in particular) have regard-'.


             (d) Section 117B enumerates considerations that are applicable
                  'in all cases', which must include foreign criminal cases.
                   Thus when s.117C (which  deals  with  foreign  criminals)
                  states that it sets out 'additional'  considerations  that
                  must mean considerations in addition to those set  out  in
                  s.117B.


             (e) Sections 117A-117D do not represent any  kind  of  radical
                  departure from or  'override'  of  previous  case  law  on
                  Article 8 so far as concerns the  need  for  a  structured
                  approach.  In particular, they do not disturb the need for
                  judges to ask themselves the five  questions  set  out  in
                  Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  Sections 117A-117D are essentially
                  a further elaboration of  Razgar's  question  5  which  is
                  essentially about proportionality and justifiability.


         (2)      It is not an error of law to fail to refer to ss.117A-117D
             considerations if the judge has applied the test he or she was
             supposed to apply according to  its  terms;  what  matters  is
             substance, not form."




  46. In AM (S117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal  held
      that an appellant can gain no positive rights to a grant of  leave  to
      remain from either s117B(2) or (3), whatever the degree of his fluency
      in English, or the  strength  of  his  financial  resources.  Further,
      Parliament has now drawn a sharp distinction  between  any  period  of
      time during which a person has been in the UK  "unlawfully",  and  any
      period of time during which that person's immigration status in the UK
      was merely "precarious". A person's immigration status  is  precarious
      if their continued presence will depend on a further grant  of  leave.




  47. Where the  question  of  proportionality  is  reached,  the  'ultimate
      question for  the  appellate  immigration  authority  is  whether  the
      refusal of leave to enter or remain, in circumstances where  the  life
      of the family cannot reasonably be expected to be  enjoyed  elsewhere,
      taking full account of all considerations weighing in  favour  of  the
      refusal, prejudices the family life  of  the  applicant  in  a  manner
      sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of  the  fundamental  right
      protected by Article 8' Huang.


  48.  I take  account  of  the  fact  that  the  maintenance  of  effective
      immigration control is in the public  interest.  In  relation  to  the
      relevant  factors,  all  Appellants  speak  English.  They   are   not
      financially independent as they receive  ï¿½350  a  month  in  order  to
      accommodate themselves. Their private lives  were  established  whilst
      here unlawfully and therefore can be given only little weight.




  49. The  first  and  second  Appellants  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship with a qualifying child and therefore the public interest
      does not require their removal where it would  not  be  reasonable  to
      expect the child to leave the United Kingdom (section  117B  (6)).  In
      Treebhawon and others (section 117B(6)) [2015] UKUT  00674  (IAC)  the
      Upper Tribunal held that in any case where the conditions enshrined in
      section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
      are satisfied, the section 117B(6) public interest prevails  over  the
      public interests identified in section 117B (1)-(3).




  50. The removal of the third Appellant's family from the UK  would  entail
      his constructive removal in that he is their dependent and  could  not
      enjoy the substance of his rights if they were removed.  He  would  be
      compelled to leave with them. His best interests are  to  remain  with
      both parents in the United Kingdom where he is the entitled to all the
      rights flowing from citizenship. In view of  his  age,  the  case  law
      indicates that he will have  established  a  meaningful  private  life
      outside the home and I accept on the evidence before me that  this  is
      so. Further, he has never been to Nigeria. Whilst the parents  have  a
      continuing connection with Nigeria, the importance of his  citizenship
      cannot be played down. Mr Melvin submits in his skeleton argument that
      the third Appellant could be left with relatives or return when  older
      to pursue his education in the UK.  However, this submission does  not
      accord with the ruling of the Court of Justice in Zambrano which  held
      at paragraphs 42 to 45 that the refusal to grant a residence  card  to
      parents of a dependent European Citizen child has the  effect  of  the
      deprivation of the enjoyment of their  rights  because  it  is  to  be
      assumed that the children would have to leave  the  territory  of  the
      Union to accompany their parents. In the circumstances  it  cannot  be
      reasonable to expect the third Appellant to leave the UK.  The  public
      interest therefore does not require the Appellants'  removal  and  the
      decision is therefore not proportionate.




Decision

  51. The appeals under the Immigration Rules are dismissed.


  52. The appeals under Article 8 are allowed.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

This case concerns children and I therefore consider it appropriate to  make
an anonymity order. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,
the appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify them or any member of  their  family.   This
direction applies both to the appellants and to the respondent.  Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.



Signed                                             Date
