Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Z Bantleman, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Lal promulgated  on  28th  December  2018  allowing  the
    Appellant's  appeal  on  the  basis  of  her  protection  claim  to  be
    recognised as a refugee and in respect of  Articles  2  and  3  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights.  I shall refer to the  parties  as
    they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The decision of Judge Lal was appealed and permission  was  granted  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Buchanan in the following terms:

         "The Grounds of Appeal contend that the FTTJ arguably erred on  the
         basis that he failed to examine any protection which  the  Nepalese
         authorities may be able to afford to a gay woman (paragraph 5); and
         failed to explain why family hostility would be enough  to  warrant
         international protection (also paragraph 5);  and  then  failed  to
         address issues of relocation (paragraph 6).  It is  contended  that
         in the absence of these  findings,  the  FTTJ  fell  into  material
         misdirection of law.

         It may be argued that the FTTJ's conclusion at paragraph 27 on  the
         document 'there is no doubt ...  that  were  the  appellant  to  be
         returned she would be at real risk of persecution from  her  family
         specifically as well as from the family of her ex-husband'  is,  as
         contended  by  the  respondent,   insufficient   to   address   the
         requirements to be met in a claim for international protection.

         It is arguable by reference to the Grounds of Appeal that there may
         have been error of law in the  Decision.   I  grant  permission  to
         appeal."

 3. I was not provided with a Rule  24  reply  by  the  Appellant  but  was
    provided with  a  skeleton  argument  by  Counsel  which  I  took  into
    consideration when reaching my decision.

Error of Law

 4. At the close of the hearing I indicated that I did find that there  was
    a material error of law in the decision such  that  it  should  be  set
    aside, but only in relation to its outcome as is explained  below.   My
    reasons for so finding are as follows.

 5. In respect of the Grounds of Appeal, the key complaints made  are  that
    Nepal has a progressive legal approach to  same  sex  relationships  as
    identified by  the  Human  Rights  Watch  Report  at  Annex  H  of  the
    Respondent's  bundle,  and  that  the  judge  failed  to  examine   any
    protection the Nepalese authorities may be able to afford the Appellant
    and that there was no reason advanced as to why the  authorities  could
    not offer such protection, nor why in  the  alternative  the  Appellant
    could not relocate within Nepal.   In  respect  of  those  grounds,  Mr
    Walker relied on them without any further embellishment.  Ms  Bantleman
    valiantly tried to persuade me that the judge's findings at ��29 to  31
    were sufficient to represent an implicit consideration that sufficiency
    of  protection  by  the  Nepalese  authorities  was  unavailable   thus
    resulting in the Appellant rightly being recognised as a  refugee,  and
    thus pointing to there being no  need  for  consideration  of  internal
    relocation as a consequence.  However, given the consideration  of  the
    risk upon return at �29 is said to give  support  for  the  conclusions
    reached on Articles 2 and 3 in respect of the Appellant's human rights,
    it is important to see what findings have been made with some care.

 6. I pause at this juncture to note that the Secretary of  State  has  not
    sought to challenge  any  of  the  findings  made  in  respect  of  the
    Appellant being a gay woman  and  actively  and  openly  enjoying  that
    sexuality, and I also note that there was no challenge to  the  finding
    in �29 that the Appellant will not seek to deny  or  hide  that  active
    expression of her sexuality on return to Nepal.

 7. Turning to �29 and its content, it is first said that the Appellant  is
    an active gay woman and it is accepted that were  she  to  be  returned
    this would create a real risk upon return.  There is nothing that I can
    see in that sentence that necessarily points to any material error.

 8. Continuing the First-tier Tribunal states that it accepts the  evidence
    of the Appellant.  Again, there is nothing there that I  can  see  that
    points to any material error of law.

 9. The final two sentences of �29 however are important in  that  this  is
    all that remains in terms  of  the  analysis  of  risk  on  return  and
    sufficiency of protection by the judge, according to Ms Bantleman.

10. In the final two sentences the judge states that there is no doubt that
    the Appellant will not seek  to  deny  the  active  expression  of  her
    sexuality - I pause to note that this has not been taken issue with and
    I accept this on its face - however, the judge then states  immediately
    after that as follows: "At this point her fear of persecution  and  ill
    treatment will be well founded because of the presence  of  her  family
    and her  ex-husband.   That  is  a  significant  risk  factor  to  this
    Appellant".

11.  In  my  view,  those  sentences  are  insufficient  to  demonstrate  a
    sufficiently reasoned conclusion on  the  'sufficiency  of  protection'
    aspect of the protection claim, and consequently I do see force in  the
    Respondent's appeal,  strictly  on  the  grounds  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal has failed to complete its analysis of whether  the  Appellant
    is eligible for a grant of protection  as  a  refugee  or  entitled  to
    protection of her Articles 2 and 3 ECHR rights, in that the  judge  has
    performed an exemplary analysis up until this point, however has failed
    to analyse the sufficiency of  protection  and/or  internal  relocation
    factors that may remain and provide reasons to support  the  conclusion
    that he reached in this regard.

12. Looking at  the  skeleton  argument  that  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, albeit Miss Bantleman sought to persuade me  that  these  two
    sentences were sufficient to  contain  the  complete  analysis  of  any
    sufficiency of protection, I note that  paragraphs  81  to  84  of  the
    skeleton argument of  previous  Counsel  (before  the  FTT)  did  state
    include a separate section in the submissions made  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant entitled "Sufficiency of  Protection",  following  which  (at
    paragraphs 85 to 89 of that skeleton) there  were  further  submissions
    regarding internal relocation.  In that light, given the position taken
    by previous Counsel, that this was  an  issue  that  required  explicit
    consideration (and thus being raised in  a  skeleton  argument),  I  am
    afraid that I cannot see that these two sentences  were  sufficient  to
    show consideration of the question of whether the Nepalese  authorities
    are able to provide protection for the Appellant (notwithstanding  that
    they have previously been unable to do so (which will form a  necessary
    and important part of the consideration given  to  the  sufficiency  of
    protection assessment upon remittal).

13. Turning to Ms Bantleman's skeleton argument, I accept the analysis that
    she has posited at  paragraphs  6  to  14  of  her  skeleton  argument.
    However, given the detailed analysis from paragraph 15 onwards entitled
    "Risk of State Actors" and the analysis at paragraph 27  onwards  which
    considers authorities such as Horvath as well as the objective evidence
    that was before the First-tier Tribunal as  well  as  the  analysis  at
    paragraph 37 which concerns authorities such as  AH  (Sudan)  regarding
    the internal relocation aspect (in the alternative),  these  paragraphs
    go to show that there is more that could be said, in  relation  to  the
    topics of sufficiency of protection and internal  relocation,  and  the
    consideration given thus  far  in  ��29  to  31  of  the  decision  are
    deficient.

14. In light of the above findings, I set aside ��29 to 31  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision alone,  and  make  the  observation  that  the
    finding that the Appellant's evidence has been accepted and that  there
    is no doubt that she will not seek to deny the active expression of her
    sexuality on return to Nepal remain intact also.

Remittal to the same or a differently constituted bench

15. I have canvassed with the parties whether this matter ought not  to  go
    back before the same First-tier Tribunal Judge, given the nature of the
    material error of law is that  there  is  simply  an  insufficiency  of
    reasoning given to the remainder of  the  protection  in  human  rights
    analysis made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge,  whom  has  heard  this
    matter and made a lawful assessment of the Appellant's claim as far  as
    it goes.

16. Both representatives encouraged me to follow this course of action  and
    agreed that the matter should be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for completion of the consideration of the protection and human  rights
    claims by Judge Lal specifically.

Notice of Decision

17. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside  in  relation  to
    ��29 to 31 alone and this matter is remitted to be heard by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Lal specifically.

Directions

 1) The appeal is to be remitted to IAC Hatton Cross and is  to  be  listed
    before Judge Lal.

 2) A Nepalese interpreter is required.

 3) No witnesses are expected to be called other than the Appellant.

 4) The time estimate given remains at two hours.

 5) The anonymity direction is maintained.

 6) Before concluding this decision, I record that Ms Bantleman was keen to
    impress upon me that on the day  of  the  hearing  in  this  protection
    claim, the  Secretary  of  State  had  served  upon  the  Appellant  an
    unpublished and 'secret' policy in relation to Nepal entitled  "Country
    Background Note, Nepal (Version 1.0, August 2018)".  This Note does  in
    fact mention sexual orientation and/or gender identity at section 13 of
    the unpublished Country Background Note, which is of importance  as  it
    does conflict, to some extent at least, with  the  Human  Rights  Watch
    Report which the Respondent sought to rely  upon  at  Annex  H  of  the
    Respondent's bundle in pursuing this onward appeal which Mr Walker  did
    not place steadfast reliance upon.  I  asked  Mr  Walker  whether  this
    report was truly  unpublished  and  all  he  could  tell  me  was  that
    according to its introductory note its purpose was that  it  should  be
    considered by decision makers handling particular types  of  protection
    and human rights claims, such as the present one. With  the  assistance
    of the parties, I myself searched for this note online  on  the  gov.uk
    website, however we collectively could not find  it.   I  do  not  know
    whether it is published or not but I do commend the Presenting  Officer
    at the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  having  disclosed  and  served  this
    document on the Appellant and  having  put  it  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and for disclosing all relevant information in  the  Secretary
    of State's possession.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
