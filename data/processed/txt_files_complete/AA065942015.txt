Appellant:    Mr. P Mangion, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
Respondent:   Ms. S Rogers, instructed by IAC Ltd


                                  DECISION

Introduction


 1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the
    respondent to this appeal, is Mr. Khalid Mohammed Osman.  However,  for
    ease of reference in the course of this  decision  I  shall  adopt  the
    parties' status as it was before the First-tier Tribunal.  I  shall  in
    this decision, refer to Mr. Khalid Mohammed Osman as the appellant  and
    the Secretary of State as the respondent.


 2. The appellant arrived in the UK clandestinely on  9th  March  2011  and
    made an application for international protection  as  a  refugee.   The
    application was refused by the respondent on 8th April 2011.  There was
    an appeal heard against  that  refusal  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Holmes.  The appeal was dismissed for the reasons set out in a decision
    promulgated on 16th June 2011.  The appellant  appealed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal and although permission to appeal was granted, the appeal  was
    ultimately dismissed.  By 14th May 2012, the  appellant  had  exhausted
    his appeal rights.   Notwithstanding  that,  further  submissions  were
    made in 2012, which were refused.   However, by letter dated  2nd  July
    2014 still further submissions were made.   On  24th  March  2015,  the
    respondent concluded that the further submissions made by the appellant
    amount to a fresh claim.  The respondent considered the merits  of  the
    fresh claim for asylum and concluded that the appellant had  failed  to
    provide sufficient evidence that he is originally from Sudan  and  that
    he is of the Zaghawa ethnicity.  The claim for asylum was refused,  and
    the respondent made a decision to remove the appellant pursuant to  s10
    of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The  appellant  appealed  that
    decision and the  appeal  was  allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Griffiths for the reasons set out in a decision promulgated on 6th July
    2015.  It is that decision that is the subject of the appeal before me.


 3. In her decision, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Griffiths  found  that  the
    appellant is a Sudanese national of Zaghawa ethnicity.  She found  that
    he does not have any other nationality and that in those circumstances,
    he would be at risk on return to Sudan and is entitled to international
    protection as a refugee.


 4. The respondent appeals on the ground that  in  reaching  her  decision,
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Griffiths  erred  in  law.   The  respondent
    contends that having  correctly  reminded  herself  that  the  previous
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes is her starting point, the
    Judge treats the previous decision as a record of evidence, without any
    proper engagement with  the  findings  previously  made  by  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  as  to  the  appellant's  nationality  or  his
    credibility.


 5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Ransley
    on 27th July 2015.  The matter comes before me to consider  whether  or
    not the determination by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Griffiths  involved
    the making of a material error of law.


The hearing on 18th March 2016


 6. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Mangian submits that at paragraph  [52]
    of her decision, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Griffiths  reminds  herself
    that the decision of the previous Judge, is her starting  point.    She
    refers to the significant and important evidence of Mr Verney that, she
    considers, explains the  reason  for  the  issue  of  a  naturalisation
    certificate being raised before Judge Holmes, leading  to  his  finding
    that the appellant holds another nationality.  Mr Mangian submits  that
    in dealing with the matter in that way, the Judge failed to have regard
    to two important factors.  First, at paragraph [36]  of  his  decision,
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  had  already  considered,  at  some
    length, whether the appellant may have had difficulties in  giving  his
    evidence as a result of translation. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes
    recorded  that  the  appellant  was  asked  several  times  whether  he
    understood the interpreter and the appellant said that he did.  Second,
    Mr Mangian submits that the appellant  had  appealed  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes to the Upper Tribunal.  In the  course
    of  his  decision  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal,  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Zucker states:


         "19. ....Ms Brakaj points to paragraph 1.3.1 of the  report  of  Dr
         Bekalo which refers to an Arabic speaking  interpreter  being  used
         throughout but that I am afraid does  not  significantly  undermine
         the Judge's observations because as Ms Brakaj will know, when  this
         matter first came before the Tribunal on  24th  May  2011  and  was
         adjourned in order that the curriculum vitae of Dr Bekalo might  be
         obtained, it was also  adjourned  because  the  Appellant  did  not
         understand the Arabic interpreter provided by  the  Tribunal.  What
         was required for the further hearing before  Judge  Holmes  was  an
         Arabic Sudanese speaker in other words it was necessary to have the
         right dialect....."


 7. Mr Mangion submits that in the circumstances, First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Griffiths fell  into  error  in  not  having  properly  considered  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes and the decision of Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge Zucker in reaching her decision.


 8. In reply, Ms Rogers submits that at paragraph  [52]  of  her  decision,
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffiths correctly identifies  the  task  of
    the Tribunal in an appeal such as  this.    The  previous  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes is a starting point.   The  Judge  was
    not reviewing that decision.  She submits that  the  previous  decision
    was not binding upon the Judge and it was open to the Judge, for proper
    reasons, to depart from the previous decision.  Ms Rogers submits  that
    although there is no express reference  to  the  previous  findings  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes  or  to  the  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in the decision, that is not to say that  the  Judge  did  not
    have the previous findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  mind.   Ms
    Rogers submits that the Judge  very  carefully  analysed  the  evidence
    before her.  As the Judge noted at paragraph [10] of her decision,  the
    issue in the appeal was the appellant's credibility and whether he had,
    or has ever had, a naturalisation  certificate.  In  dealing  with  the
    latter issue, the Judge records and considers the evidence  before  her
    about Arabic languages and the potential problems that can arise during
    translation. Ms. Rogers submits that  at  the  hearing  of  the  appeal
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffiths there was  further  evidence
    that the Judge was  plainly  entitled  to  rely  upon.  The  Judge  was
    entitled to rely upon the expert evidence in  particular,  in  reaching
    her decision.  The evidence was credible and the Judge was entitled  to
    attach significant weight to it.


Discussion


 9. I have carefully read the decisions of First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes
    promulgated on 16th June 2011, the decision of  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Zucker promulgated on 1st March 2012 and the decision  of  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Griffiths.   I  have  taken  into  account   the
    respondent's grounds of appeal and the submissions made  before  me  at
    the hearing.


10. As there has been a previous determination by an Immigration Judge, the
    Devaseelam principles, which were approved by the Court  of  Appeal  in
    Djebbar v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2004]  EWCA  Civ
    804 apply.  The six Devaseelam principles can be summarized thus;


          i) The first Adjudicator's determination  should  always  be  the
             starting-point. It is  the  authoritative  assessment  of  the
             Appellant's status at the  time  it  was  made.  In  principle
             issues such as whether the Appellant was properly represented,
             or whether he gave evidence, are irrelevant to this.


         ii) Facts happening since the  first  Adjudicator's  determination
             can always be taken into account by the second Adjudicator. If
             those facts lead the  second  Adjudicator  to  the  conclusion
             that, at the date of his determination  and  on  the  material
             before him, the appellant  makes  his  case,  so  be  it.  The
             previous  decision,  on  the   material   before   the   first
             Adjudicator and at that date, is not inconsistent.


        iii) Facts happening before the first  Adjudicator's  determination
             but having no relevance to the issues before him can always be
             taken into  account  by  the  second  Adjudicator.  The  first
             Adjudicator will not have been concerned with such facts,  and
             his determination is not an assessment of them.


         iv) Facts personal to the Appellant that were not brought  to  the
             attention  of  the  first  Adjudicator,  although  they   were
             relevant to the issues before him, should be  treated  by  the
             second  Adjudicator  with  the  greatest  circumspection.   An
             Appellant who  seeks,  in  a  later  appeal,  to  add  to  the
             available facts in an  effort  to  obtain  a  more  favourable
             outcome is properly regarded with suspicion from the point  of
             view of credibility. It must also be borne in  mind  that  the
             first Adjudicator's determination was made at a time closer to
             the events alleged and  in  terms  of  both  fact-finding  and
             general  credibility  assessment  would  tend  to   have   the
             advantage. For this reason, the adduction of such facts should
             not usually lead to any  reconsideration  of  the  conclusions
             reached by the first Adjudicator.


          v) Evidence of other facts � for example country evidence  �  may
             not suffer from the  same  concerns  as  to  credibility,  but
             should be treated with caution. The reason is  different  from
             that in (4)


         vi) If before the second Adjudicator the Appellant relies on facts
             that are not materially different from those put to the  first
             Adjudicator, and proposes to support the claim by what  is  in
             essence the same evidence as that available to  the  Appellant
             at that time, the second Adjudicator should regard the  issues
             as settled by the first Adjudicator's determination  and  make
             his findings in  line  with  that  determination  rather  than
             allowing the matter to be re-litigated.


11. First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffiths noted  at  paragraph  [52]  of  her
    decision that Judge Holmes found the appellant had not told  the  truth
    about his origins and that the appellant's account  was  lacking.   The
    Judge reminded herself  that  the  decision  of  Judge  Holmes  is  her
    starting point.  She goes on to say "... It  is  not  for  me  to  say,
    whether in the light of  the  further  evidence,  there  is  sufficient
    effectively to set aside his determination."  But that is precisely the
    effect of her decision.  The Judge noted at  paragraph  [52]  that  the
    evidence has not materially  changed  save  for  the   significant  and
    important evidence of Mr. Verney, who  explains  the  reasons  for  the
    issue of a naturalisation certificate being raised before Judge  Holmes
    that  led  to  the  Judge  finding  that  the  Appellant  held  another
    nationality.


12. The appellant failed in the prior proceedings to persuade Judge  Holmes
    that his nationality and identity were as claimed.   Judge  Holmes  was
    not satisfied that he was being honest about his origins or  about  his
    life prior to entry to the UK. Judge Holmes did  not  accept  that  the
    appellant is ethnically Zaghawa as he had claimed, but accepted that if
    the appellant is in truth a Zaghawa as  he  claims,  then  it  is  more
    likely that he is a citizen of Chad, where the Zaghawa are  politically
    and economically dominant.


13. First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffiths correctly notes that  the  decision
    of Judge Holmes is her starting point.  She does not in fact  refer  to
    the 'Deevaseelam' principles and how they might  apply  to  this  case.
    She does not refer to the evidence that was before Judge Holmes or  the
    careful evaluation of the appeal that was undertaken by  Judge  Holmes.
    There is no reference in the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Griffiths to the reasons set out in the decision of Judge Holmes.   The
    failure to address the Deevaseelam guidance and to  properly  refer  to
    the very clear findings that had previously been made by  Judge  Homes,
    in my judgment, amount to a material error of law that  is  capable  of
    affecting the outcome of the appeal.


14. I accept that the Judge had before her material  in  the  form  of  the
    evidence of Mr. Verney that was not available to Judge Holmes,  but  on
    any view, Judge Holmes had carefully considered whether  the  appellant
    may have had difficulties  in  giving  his  evidence  as  a  result  of
    translation.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffiths  does  not  refer  to
    that very careful consideration by Judge  Holmes  of  material  issues,
    when considering whether  she  should  depart  from  the  authoritative
    assessment of the appellant's status by Judge Holmes.


15. In my judgement there is a material error of law  in  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffiths and the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal is set aside with no findings preserved.


16. As to disposal, I have taken into account paragraph  7  of  the  Senior
    President's Practice Statement of 25th September 2012 and decided  that
    it is appropriate to remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    because of the extent of judicial fact-finding which is necessary.  The
    parties will be advised in writing of the date and time of the hearing.
    The appeal is to be heard de novo and no findings are preserved.


Notice of Decision


17. The appeal  is  allowed.   The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    promulgated on 6th July 2015 is set aside and I remit the matter for  a
    de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.


18. No anonymity direction is applied for and none is made.
