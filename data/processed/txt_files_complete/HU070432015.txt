For the Respondent:    Mr C. Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Guinea who is married to a United Kingdom
    sponsor Mr Maroof Diallo. On 27 May 2015 she made application for entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. That
    application was refused and  she  subsequently  appealed.  Following  a
    hearing, and in a decision promulgated on 26 April 2017, Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Chudleigh dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  both
    under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.  At  paragraph
    23 of the decision the Judge found for the Appellant in relation to the
    relationship with her sponsor and that a satisfactory  explanation  for
    the absence of an English Language Test Certificate had been  provided.
    However, at paragraph 22 the Judge recorded that it was  common  ground
    that the Appellant failed to provide payslips covering a period of  six
    months prior to the date of application as was required by Appendix  FM
    - SE. In those circumstances it was demonstrably the case that  at  the
    date of the decision the  Appellant  had  failed  to  comply  with  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules  and  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was correct to refuse entry clearance. The payslips related  to
    the period from 11 February 2015 to 3 June 2015 which was less than six
    months. The Judge  noted  however,  that  the  sponsor's  employer  had
    provided letters stating that the Sponsor's gross income was above  the
    threshold of ï¿½18, 600. The Judge then correctly, pursuant to Section 82
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, recorded  that  an
    appeal could only be brought against the decision  to  refuse  a  human
    right claim and went on to make findings in relation to  the  issue  of
    proportionality.

 2. Permission to appeal was initially refused but  a  renewed  application
    was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam in a  decision  dated  23
    January 2018. Judge McWilliam's decision states: -

         "The Appellant seeks permission to appeal against the  decision  of
         FT Judge Chudleigh to dismiss her application for  entry  clearance
         as a spouse.

         It is arguable that the Judge did not make a finding whether at the
         date of  he  (sic)  decision  the  Appellant  met  the  substantive
         requirements of the Rules in respect of maintenance and  that  this
         was   arguably   a   relevant   factor   in   the   assessing    of
         proportionality".

 3. Thus, the appeal came before me today.

 4. Mr Okoroh urged me to accept that the Judge  had  materially  erred  by
    failing to apply the evidential flexibility rules set out in  paragraph
    D of Appendix FM - SE. In particular Paragraph D(d)(i)  which  provides
    that where a document does not contain all of the specified information
    and that the missing  information  is  verifiable  from  the  documents
    submitted  with  the  application,  the  application  may  be   granted
    exceptionally  providing  the  decisionmaker  is  satisfied  that   the
    document is genuine and that the applicant  meets  the  requirement  to
    which the document relates. The Judge found that the Appellant provided
    five months' pay slips instead of six months' pay slips but the missing
    information was verifiable from  other  documents  submitted  with  the
    application and in particular a bank statement  showing  seven  months'
    wages being credited to the account. Further the Judge did not consider
    that the applicant succeeded  on  other  grounds  and  that  evidential
    flexibility should have been applied. Mr Okoroh referred me to  Section
    3.4 "Evidential flexibility"  of  the  Respondent's  own  guidance.  He
    submitted that it was incumbent upon the decisionmaker in  a  situation
    like this, where  there  was  an  absence  of  one  item  of  specified
    documentation, to nonetheless grant the application on the  basis  that
    the information was verifiable from other documents submitted with  the
    application.

 5. Mr Avery submitted that there was  no  error  in  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's decision. He queried whether it was the Appellant's  position
    that the Judge should have exercised a discretion not hitherto utilised
    by the Entry Clearance Officer. There was no reason for the Judge to do
    this. The policy referred to by the Appellant's representative  was  in
    relation to how the Secretary  of  State  should  exercise  discretion.
    There was no reason to go beyond the  specified  material  provided  as
    other reasons were also given for this refusal.

 6. I find the Judge has not materially erred as  asserted  by  Mr  Okoroh.
    Contrary to the grounds of permission to  appeal  the  Judge  has  made
    clear findings as to whether at the date of the decision the  Appellant
    met the substantive requirements of the Immigration Rules in respect of
    maintenance and having done so the Judge has factored her conclusion on
    that into the Article 8 balancing exercise. When  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer made the  decision,  the  Appellant  was  unable  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules  in  relation  to  the  specified
    documents. That decision also refused  the  application  on  two  other
    bases. It was therefore not incumbent upon the Entry Clearance Officer,
    where he did not anticipate addressing the omission  of  the  pay  slip
    would lead to a grant to allow the application because it was going  to
    be refused in any event for other reasons.

 7. The Judge has not materially erred as asserted.

Decision

I uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.
