Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Y Din, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department. However, for the sake of clarity, I shall use the titles by
    which the parties were known before the First-Tier  Tribunal  with  the
    Secretary of State referred to as "the Respondent" and Harpreet Kaur as
    "the Appellant".

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India who entered the United Kingdom on 3
    October 2010 as a student. On 4 December 2013 she was granted leave  to
    remain as a spouse valid until 4 June 2016. On 1 June 2016 she  made  a
    human rights application for leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  her
    marriage to Jagroop Singh Sangha. That  application  was  refused.  The
    Respondent noted that the English test submitted by  the  Appellant  in
    her previous  application  had  been  withdrawn  by  ETS  and  declared
    questionable as voice recognition software detected the presence  of  a
    proxy tester who sat the test in her place.

 3. The Appellant appealed and following a hearing at Birmingham, and in  a
    decision promulgated on 25 September  2017,  Judge  of  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal Butler allowed the appeal "under the Immigration Rules".

 4. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which was granted  by  Judge
    of the First-Tier Tribunal Pedro on 16 March 2018.

 5. His reasons for so granting were:-

                 "1. The appellant is a citizen of India born on 24 August
1989.


         2. The respondent seeks permission to appeal, in time against a
         decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Butler promulgated on 25
         September 2017 to allow the appellant's appeal made on human rights
         grounds against the decision of the respondent dated 3 October 2016
         to refuse her human rights claim.


         3. The grounds assert that the judge misdirected himself and made
         material errors relating to (1) the evidential burden upon the
         respondent and (2) in allowing the appeal under the immigration
         rules and not on human rights grounds in circumstances where the
         appeal was restricted to human rights grounds and could not be
         allowed simply on the basis that the respondent's decision was not
         in accordance with the Immigration Rules.


         4. The grounds disclose arguable errors of law capable of affecting
         the outcome."

 6. Thus, the appeal came before me today.

 7. At the outset Ms Everett indicated  that  there  had  been  discussions
    between the parties and it was agreed that  the  Judge  had  materially
    erred as asserted within the Respondent's grounds. However,  given  the
    Judge's findings and having reviewed the file, the Respondents position
    was that the decision should be remade in the Appellant's favour.

 8. Naturally Mr Din did not seek to argue against this.

 9. I share the above analysis. The Judge materially erred in allowing  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules. It should  have  been  heard  as  a
    human rights appeal. Given the factual matrix and the acknowledgment by
    the Respondent that the decision disproportionately interferes with the
    Appellant's human rights under Article 8 of the European Convention and
    Human Rights and  I  find  that  the  Appellant's  appeal  should  have
    succeeded.
