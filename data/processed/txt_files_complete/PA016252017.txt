Representation:
For the Appellant:     Dr Mynott (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity direction in this matter.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Eritrea. He entered the United Kingdom on
    August  25,  2015  and  claimed  asylum.  The  respondent  refused  his
    application on January 31, 2017.

 3. The appellant appealed that decision  on  February  15,  2016  and  the
    appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Alty  (hereinafter
    called the Judge) on March 16, 2017. In a decision promulgated on March
    24, 2017 the Judge dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

 4. The appellant appealed that decision on April 7, 2017 arguing the Judge
    failed to explain why the appellant's lack  of  credibility  outweighed
    the credibility of the witness who had given evidence at the hearing in
    which he stated he knew  the  appellant  from  Eritrea.  Permission  to
    appeal was  given  by  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    McCarthy on August 14, 2017.

 5. The case came before me on the above-date.

 6. Dr Mynott adopted the grounds of appeal and submitted that at  [32]  of
    the Judge's decision she set out the evidence given by the witness  but
    then rejected that evidence because she  was  not  persuaded  over  the
    appellant's own credibility. Additionally, at [31]  the  Judge  wrongly
    summarised paragraph 339L HC 395 because she failed to have  regard  to
    "other evidence".

 7. Mr McVeety referred me to [32] and conceded  that  the  Judge  made  no
    findings on the evidence from the witness. He accepted it was incumbent
    upon the Judge to make findings on crucial evidence and he accepted the
    Judge did not do this.

 8. Having considered [32] of the Judge's decision I concluded that  whilst
    the Judge set out the evidence from the witness she  did  not  actually
    say whether she accepted it  or  rejected  it.  The  evidence  is  very
    important because if  the  evidence  was  accepted  then  it  would  be
    incumbent on the Judge to  explain  why  she  then  did  not  find  the
    appellant to be a credible witness.

 9. Unfortunately in this case, the Judge neither accepted nor rejected the
    witness evidence and this undermined her subsequent findings.

    NOTICE OF DECISION

10. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I remit the appeal back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing on this issue as  both  parties
    agreed this was a matter that needed full  findings.  No  findings  are
    preserved.

Signed                              Date     22/12/2017
