Representation:
For the Appellants:    No appearance
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. There was no appearance by the sponsor at the hearing.  I am  satisfied
    that she and the appellants  themselves  were  served  with  notice  of
    hearing and I have decided there was no reason not to proceed with  the
    appeal.

 2. The appellants (a married couple) who are citizens of India  have  been
    granted permission to appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Juss who for reasons given  in  his  decision  dated  18  January  2019
    dismissed their appeals against the Entry Clearance Officer's decisions
    dated 2 July 2018 refusing to issue EEA family permits  to  them.   The
    appellants had sought these permits  as  the  dependent  direct  family
    members of their daughter-in-law Oana-Luiza Ilina, a Romanian national,
    and the wife of their son Vinod Anandan.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer
    considered the appellants had not  provided  sufficient  evidence  that
    Oana-Luiza Ilina  was  exercising  her  treaty  rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 3. Judge Juss dismissed the appeal for reasons given at [9] to [13] in his
    decision as follows:

         "9.  I have given careful consideration to the oral and documentary
             evidence and submissions from both sides  that  I  have  heard
             today.

         10.  First, I have before me  a  letter  dated  21  May  2018  from
             'Results Through Digital' and  I  can  see  that  this  simply
             confirms the terms of the employment of the EEA national.   In
             the same way there is a letter dated 16 May  2018  from  'Visa
             Europe' confirming that Mr Anandan is employed by 'Visa Europe
             Services' since March 20, 2018 and is paid �80,000  per  year.
             There is then a Payslip from the latter showing net payment of
             �4,386.28 for 18 May 2018, and confirming the annual salary is
             �80,000 per annum.  I  note  that  Mr  Anandan  also  holds  a
             Residence Card as a family member of the EEA national.   There
             is no other evidence.

         11.   Accordingly,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  Ms.   Oana   Luiza
             Nellooruvalappil, the EEA national, sponsoring the Appellants,
             has been able to show that she is exercising treaty rights  in
             the manner required.  There is a dearth of evidence  that  has
             been put forward to  this  effect.   This  appeal,  according,
             falls to be refused.

         12.  Second, I am also not satisfied that the Appellants  can  show
             'dependency' on the EEA national, or on their son.  There is a
             consistent line of  long-standing  authority  now  as  to  how
             'dependency' is to be interpreted in EU law,  which  has  been
             repeatedly been affirmed and re-affirmed.  With respect to the
             meaning of dependency within Article 2 of  the  Directive  and
             regulation 7 of the 2006 Regulations, the Upper  Tribunal  has
             set out the relevant criteria in Moneke (EEA -  OFMs)  Nigeria
             [2011] UKUT 341 (IAC), drawing on Court of Justice cases  such
             as Lebon C-316/85 [1987] ECR 2811 and Jia  v  Migrationsverket
             Case C-1/05; and Court of Appeal cases such  as  Pedro  [2004]
             EWCA Civ  1358  and  SM  (India)  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer
             (Mumbai) [2009] EWCA Civ 1426.

         13.  In Moneke at [41] it was noted that  "dependency  is  not  the
             same as mere receipt of some  financial  assistance  from  the
             sponsor.  As the Court of Appeal made plain in SM (India)  ...
             dependency means dependency in the sense used by the Court  of
             Justice in the case of Lebon ..."  There is also the Court  of
             Justice ruling in the case of Secretary of State for the  Home
             Department v Islam  &  Anor  [2012]  EUECJ  C-83/11  (made  in
             response to the order of reference by the  Upper  Tribunal  in
             the case of  MR  and  Others  (EEA  extended  family  members)
             Bangladesh  [2010]  UKUT  449  (IAC))  which,  although  being
             concerned not with regulation 7/Article 2.2 family members but
             'Other Family Members' (OFMs) under regulation 8/Article  3.2,
             sheds further light on the Court's approach to the meaning  of
             dependency.  The Court made clear that dependency  had  to  be
             genuine, not contrived and that its interpretation had  to  be
             informed by the principle of effectiveness."

 4. The grounds of challenge to the judge's decision  raise  the  following
    points.  The first is that the EU national came to the  United  Kingdom
    with her spouse  in  2015,  since  when  they  have  been  working  and
    contributing by way of taxes and national  insurance  contributions  to
    the UK government.  The  EU  national's  previous  employer  went  into
    insolvency a few  months  prior  to  her  maternity  leave.   There  is
    reference to the new employer recommending an application be  made  for
    maternity allowance from the Department of Work and Pension and the  EU
    national complied accordingly.  There is  reference  to  the  birth  of
    their first son in December 2017 and the difficulties for the family to
    handle everything with the baby and hence the  decision  to  bring  the
    parents-in-law to help for a couple of months.

 5.  The  grounds  continue  with  the  observation  that  for   the   visa
    application, material was  provided  to  prove  dependency.   There  is
    reference also  to  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager's  review  following
    service of the notice of appeal, who decided  that  the  DWP  maternity
    allowance documentation was an "officiation" of the employment  status.



 6. A further point made in the grounds which are  somewhat  discursive  in
    nature is that the First-tier Tribunal never mentioned  the  matter  of
    maternity which was the main argument between the  appellants  and  the
    Entry Clearance Officer.  Furthermore, the point  is  raised  that  the
    Tribunal had observed that there was no evidence of dependency but this
    was never  an  issue  between  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  the
    appellants.  It is correctly argued by reference to the decision of the
    Court of Justice of the European Union in Saint  Prix  v  DWP  Case  C-
    507/12 that a woman who gives up work or  seeking  working  because  of
    physical constraints of the late stages of pregnancy  will  retain  her
    worker status provided she returns to work or finds another job  within
    a reasonable period after the birth of her child.

 7. In granting permission to  appeal,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant-
    Hutchinson observed that it was  arguable  the  judge  had  misdirected
    himself by failing to take into account the maternity aspect.

 8. After reviewing all the papers (as  she  had  an  incomplete  set),  Ms
    Holmes accepted that the judge  made  no  reference  to  the  maternity
    aspect which is readily evidenced in documents provided  in  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's bundle.  She furthermore accepts that the issue  of
    dependency  had  not  been  raised  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.
    Accordingly, I consider Ms Holmes  was  correct  to  concede  that  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Juss could not be  sustained  and
    it is therefore set aside.

 9. Prior to the hearing of  this  appeal  a  document  reached  the  Upper
    Tribunal from the sponsor  dated  29  April  2019.   In  summary,  this
    document is a letter from the Home  Office  addressed  to  the  sponsor
    dated 29 March 2019.  The first paragraph explains its  effect,  and  I
    quote:

         "I am pleased to inform you that  your  application  under  the  EU
         Settlement Scheme has  been  successful  and  that  you  have  been
         granted limited leave to remain (LTR) in  the  United  Kingdom  for
         five years under Appendix EU to the  Immigration  Rules.   This  is
         also referred to as pre-settled status.  Your status  takes  effect
         from the date of this letter which can be found above."

10.  I  have  decided  to  re-make  the  decision  in  the  Upper  Tribunal
    particularly so in the light  of  the  information  contained  in  this
    letter and the absence of any concern expressed by the Entry  Clearance
    Officer over the element of dependency.  Ms Holmes accepts that,  based
    on this letter, the appeal should be allowed as it meets the only issue
    of concern leading to the refusal  in  this  case.   Accordingly,  this
    appeal is allowed.
