For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Appellant a citizen of  Pakistan  born  on  16
    August 1983.  She appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    8 October 2012 in refusing her application for entry clearance to  come
    to the United Kingdom as the spouse of a  person  present  and  settled
    here.  The relevant Immigration Rules  were  paragraphs  281(i)(a)  and
    (ii); 281(i); 281(iii) and 281(iv) of HC 395 as amended.

2.   The Appellant's appeal was heard  at  Hatton  Cross  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Wyman who in a determination promulgated on  4  November
    2013 dismissed it under the Immigration Rules and under  Article  8  of
    the ECHR.

3.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge having  heard  and  considered  the  oral
    evidence of the Sponsor and the documentary evidence before her,  found
    the Sponsor

         "to be a credible witness with a  genuine  intent  to  support  his
         wife's application for leave to enter as a spouse.  Generally  with
         a few exceptions (that I will  discuss  below)  I  found  his  oral
         evidence corresponded with the documentary evidence provided."

4.   The Judge went on to find that  she  disagreed  with  the  Respondent's
    conclusion that he was not satisfied that the Appellant had provided  a
    valid English Language Test certificate and therefore found  in  favour
    of the Appellant in terms of paragraph 281(i)(a)(ii).

5.   The Judge went on to identify the following  at  paragraph  29  of  her
    determination:

         "The key issue in this case is  whether  or  not  the  Sponsor  was
         domiciled in the  United  Kingdom  or  in  Pakistan.   The  law  in
         Pakistan clearly allows polygamous marriages".


         50.  The facts of the case  are  not  in  dispute.   The  Appellant
             married the Sponsor in Pakistan on 24 April 2011.  The Sponsor
             was previously married to Tahzeem Iqbal.   The  civil  divorce
             certificate confirms that Mr  Mahroof's  decree  absolute  was
             pronounced on 18 April 2012".

6.   In summarising the Appellant's representative's submissions, the  Judge
    noted that the Sponsor was born in Pakistan and that it  was  contended
    that this was his domicile of origin.  The Sponsor  had  not  lost  his
    domicile in Pakistan.  He had  retained  very  strong  links  with  the
    country.  He had married his first wife in Pakistan  in  1994  and  his
    second marriage also took place in Pakistan  in  2011.   The  Sponsor's
    family owned land in Pakistan and his family retained  a  family  home.
    The Sponsor had family both  in  Pakistan  and  the  UK,  although  his
    immediate family (excluding his wife) lived in the United Kingdom.   He
    had visited  Pakistan  throughout  his  life.   It  followed  that  the
    domicile of the Sponsor, remained that of Pakistan.

7.   The First-tier Judge reasoned as to why she did not agree.  Whilst  the
    First-tier Judge fully accepted that the  Sponsor  had  retained  close
    links with Pakistan, she found that his domicile was that of the United
    Kingdom.  It followed therefore that the marriage of the  Appellant  to
    the Sponsor was not a valid marriage according to  United  Kingdom  law
    and for this reason the Judge was  not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant
    could meet the requirements of paragraph  281(i)  of  the  Rules.   The
    Judge further proceeded within her determination to provide her reasons
    for concluding that the Appellant's Article 8 claim should also fail.

8.   The Appellant made a successful application for  permission  to  appeal
    and in giving his reasons for granting permission, Designated Judge  RC
    Campbell had this inter alia to say:

         "The Appellant's case was advanced on the basis that  her  marriage
         to her Sponsor, a British citizen, was lawful and valid.   Although
         the marriage took place in April 2011, about a year before a decree
         absolute  ended  his  first  marriage,  her  Sponsor  retained  his
         domicile in Pakistan and so the marriage failed to be recognised as
         lawful.


         The Judge found, however that the Sponsor who came  to  the  United
         Kingdom when he was 1 year old and who  has  lived  in  the  United
         Kingdom for his entire life, although he had  visited  Pakistan  on
         several  occasions,  was  domiciled  here.   The   requirement   of
         paragraph 281(i) of the Rules was not met.  The Judge  went  on  to
         make an Article 8 assessment.  She concluded the Appellant and  her
         Sponsor did not enjoy family life  together  and  that  refusal  of
         entry clearance was a proportionate response.


         The grounds in support contend that the Judge  erred,  firstly,  in
         relation to the validity of the marriage.  The marriage was a valid
         one in Pakistani law  and  the  conclusion  that  the  Sponsor  was
         domiciled here was perverse and against  the  weight  of  evidence.
         The Judge found the Sponsor to be a credible witness with a genuine
         intent to support his wife's application for leave to  enter.   His
         evidence should have been  accepted  'as  a  totality  and  not  in
         piecemeal'.  Furthermore the Judge  failed  to  take  into  account
         Abdin [2012] UKUT 309."

     Designated Judge Campbell went on to express the view  that  there  was
    no merit in this ground and that the Judge had not erred in  her  self-
    direction on the law which took into account the  substantial  reliance
    by the Appellant on SM [2008] UKAIT 00092.

9.   Designated Judge Campbell continued however as follows:

         "Secondly, it is contended that  the  Judge  erred  in  failing  to
         determine the appeal under paragraphs 290 and 295A  of  the  Rules,
         which apply where fianc�s seek leave to enter.  It  is  clear  from
         the grounds of appeal the Appellant's case was also advanced on the
         basis that the fianc� provisions of  the  Rules  should  have  been
         considered by the Respondent.  At the very end  of  the  Record  of
         Proceedings, the Judge has recorded a submission by the Appellant's
         representative if she were  not  persuaded  that  the  Sponsor  was
         domiciled in Pakistan, the Tribunal ought to consider the  case  in
         the light of paragraphs 290 and 295A taking into account SZ  [2007]
         UKAIT 00037.  Notwithstanding the very great care  with  which  the
         determination has been prepared, there is nothing in it  addressing
         that submission or engaging with it.  It is arguable that the Judge
         may have erred in law in failing to consider  whether  SZ  had  any
         impact and in failing to consider whether the fianc�(e)  Rules  had
         any bearing on the case.


         Finally it is contended that the Judge's findings on Article 8  are
         perverse.  Although she found there was no valid  marriage  between
         the  Appellant  and  her  Sponsor,  she  also  found   that   their
         relationship subsisted.  The Article 8 assessment is, at paragraphs
         63 to 75 and appears to be thorough.  However, it is arguable  that
         any assessment in this context ought to have taken into account the
         Appellant's alternative case that the fianc�(e) Rules  fell  to  be
         applied.

         Permission to  appeal  is  granted  and  all  the  grounds  may  be
    argued".

10.  Thus the appeal came before me on 12 March 2014  where  my  first  task
    was to decide whether or not the determination of the First-tier  Judge
    disclosed an error or errors on  a  point  of  law  such  as  may  have
    materially affected the outcome of the appeal.

11.  In that regard and at the outset of the hearing, I was  most  helpfully
    informed by both representatives, that clearly the Judge had  erred  in
    failing to determine the appeal in the alternative under paragraphs 290
    and 295A of the Immigration Rules and that it followed that should  the
    Judge have found that the  Appellant  complied  with  those  Rules  the
    issues relating to Article 8 of the ECHR would have fallen away.

12.  To that extent therefore the parties were in agreement  that  this  was
    an issue pleaded in the grounds before the First-tier Judge that  still
    had to be considered and determined.

13.  There was however a difference of opinion between the  parties'  as  to
    whether the Judge had erred in concluding that the Appellant's marriage
    was not valid because her Sponsor was found  to  be  domiciled  in  the
    United Kingdom.

14.  In that regard Mr Melvin  raised  what  I  might  describe  as  a  mild
    concern as to whether Designated Judge Campbell  made  a  typographical
    error in view of the fact that he had considered there to be "no  merit
    in this ground" in granting permission to appeal on all of the grounds.

15.  I pointed out to Mr  Melvin  that  it  was  not  for  the  Tribunal  to
    speculate as to the Designated  Judge's  intentions.   It  was  however
    clear that permission had been granted on "all of the grounds" and  the
    Tribunal would thus proceed on that basis.

16.   Mr  Sharma  on  behalf  the  Appellant  submitted  that  there  was  a
    presumption in favour of domicile of birth and that strong  and  cogent
    reasons were required to find an alternative  domicile.   He  submitted
    that whilst it was open to a Judge to find that a given individual  was
    no longer entitled to rely on a domicile's birth, that in reaching that
    conclusion the Judge would have to address  not  only  the  documentary
    evidence but also the witness' evidence of his own intentions,  in  the
    round.

17.  Mr Sharma contended that in the  present  case,  the  First-tier  Judge
    appeared to have concluded that the Sponsor chose to  be  domiciled  in
    the UK through his actions but that she failed to consider firstly, the
    presumption of domicile of  the  country  of  birth  and  secondly  the
    Sponsor's own evidence as to his intentions.

18.  In that regard Mr  Sharma  relied  on  the  Judge's  finding  that  the
    Sponsor was a credible witness and submitted  that  credibility  should
    have been read into all of the evidence  rather  than  in  a  piecemeal
    fashion.

19.  Whilst Mr Melvin argued that the reasoning of the Judge  in  concluding
    that the Sponsor's domicile was in the United Kingdom was open  to  him
    on the evidence, he was unable to identify any aspect of the First-tier
    Judge's determination that demonstrated a consideration as  to  whether
    the Sponsor had retained a domicile of birth.

20.  As I observed to the parties, it is trite law that  domicile  of  birth
    is not easy to dislodge.  I thus agreed with Mr Sharma that "strong and
    cogent reasons were required to find an alternative domicile".

21.  In any event I observed that whilst the Judge  made  reference  to  the
    Appellant's  country  of  birth,  she  did  not  cross-refer  with  the
    submissions in terms of establishing a domicile  of  birth  and  as  Mr
    Sharma rightly pointed out, she did not seem to have placed this matter
    "in the weighing scales in balancing that part of the reasoning".

22.  In such circumstances I was able to  inform  the  parties  that  I  was
    satisfied  that  for  the  above  reasons,  the  First-tier  Judge  had
    materially erred in law.

23.  There was agreement between  myself  and  the  parties,  that  in  such
    circumstances and in consequence of my findings, it followed that there
    had been no satisfactory hearing of the substance  of  this  appeal  at
    all.

24.    The scheme of the Tribunal's, Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007  does
    not assign the function of primary fact-finding to the Upper  Tribunal.
    In such circumstances Section 12(2) of the TCEA  2007  requires  us  to
    remit the case to the First-tier or remake ourselves.

25.   For the reasons I have given above  and  with  the  agreement  of  the
    parties, I concluded that the decision should be remitted to  a  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge other  than  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Wyman  to
    determine the appeal afresh with all issues at large at Hatton Cross on
    23 July 2014.  I  was  satisfied  that  there  were  highly  compelling
    factors falling within  paragraph  7.2(b)  of  the  Senior  President's
    Practice Statement decision that the decision should not be  remade  by
    the Upper Tribunal.  It is clearly in the interest of justice that  the
    appeal of the Appellant be heard afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.

26.  For this purpose it was arranged that  the  substantive  hearing  would
    have a time estimate of two hours.  There would be oral evidence  given
    by the Sponsor for which purpose no interpreter was required.

27.  Both parties further  agreed  with  me,  that  for  this  purpose,  the
    interests of justice would not be served if the Appellant were deprived
    of the positive and accepted findings of the First-tier  Judge  in  her
    favour.  I agreed therefore that the following paragraphs of the First-
    tier Judge's determination should be preserved, namely paragraphs 44 to
    48, paragraph 60 and in relation to paragraph 61 whilst the  First-tier
    Judge's finding  that  she  accepted  that  the  Appellant  could  meet
    paragraphs 281(i)(a)(ii), 281(iii) and 281(iv) should be preserved, her
    finding that she was not satisfied the Appellant could  meet  paragraph
    281(i) of the Immigration Rules would not be preserved.  Indeed on  all
    other respects the First-tier Judge's findings would not be preserved.

Decision

28.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law such that their  decision  in  the
    present appeal should be set aside.  I remit the remaking of the appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal at Hatton Cross for hearing on 23 July 2014,
    to be heard before a First-tier Tribunal Judge  other  than  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Wyman.

29.  As before no anonymity direction is made.
