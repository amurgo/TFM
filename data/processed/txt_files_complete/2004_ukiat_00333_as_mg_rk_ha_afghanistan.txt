                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   These are appeals from decisions of adjudicators,  either  dismissing  or
   allowing asylum and human rights appeals by Sikh citizens of Afghanistan.
   The relevant point of law is whether the adjudicator's  decision  was  in
   accordance with the view since reached by the Tribunal on  the  situation
   facing such persons on return, regardless of their  personal  history  or
   circumstances, in KK [2004] UKIAT 00258, described by the Tribunal in the
   course of that decision as "the irreducible minimum case". It is  neither
   desirable nor in accordance with  the  law  for  there  to  be  different
   competing views amongst the appellate authorities on such cases,  whether
   or not  there  was  any  apparent  error  of  law  on  the  face  of  the
   adjudicator's decision as and when given: see  Shirazi  [2003]  EWCA  Civ
   1562.

2. The Tribunal based its decision in KK 04/258 on  evidence  from  a  Sikh
   still living in Kabul called [        ]. Because of the lack  of  proper
   notice of that evidence, the decision was not designated as  a  "country
   guidance" case, so does not require fresh evidence not available at  the
   time for it to be distinguished; but it was directed to be reported,  to
   provide such guidance as was possible for other cases. The ratio  of  KK
   04/258 appears at � 34:

   However, [        ] evidence, which for present purposes we have decided
   we ought to accept as passing the Karanakaran threshhold, does appear to
   show three things. First, there is a reasonable likelihood of  at  least
   moderately serious  violence  against  Sikhs  because  they  are  Sikhs;
   second, that is encouraged, and not guarded against by the perpetrators'
   perception of the authorities' attitude to it; third, there  is  nothing
   to show any specific commitment by either the international  forces,  or
   the Afghan authorities, to the protection of  minorities  generally,  or
   the Sikhs in particular. In our view those add up  to  a  real  risk  of
   persecution at the present time: that is certainly not to say  that  all
   Sikhs are being persecuted; but, on the evidence available to us  (which
   was not in its present form before the Tribunal in IB 150), any of  them
   who are identifiable as such run a real risk of it.


3. We invited Mr Sheikh, appearing as in KK 04/258 for the Home Office,  to
   refer us to any evidence there might be to contradict those conclusions.
   This was what he relied on:

   a)  State  Department  International   Religious   Freedom   report   on
      Afghanistan   (15 September 2004)
      There are two passages: at p 5/8,  an  account  is  given  of  police
      warning and investigation of a grenade attack on the only functioning
      gurdwara, in early October 2003: evidently  they  were  not  able  to
      prevent it. At p 6/8, there are references to guards being put on the
      unused gurdwaras, and a shuttle service for worshippers  at  the  one
      which  remained.  The  Human  Rights  Commission  had   secured   the
      allocation of a new Sikh cremation ground; but the community had  not
      yet taken control of it.


   b) Deutsche Welle  report  'Germany  strengthens  Commitment  to  Afghan
      Police'
      (21 May 2004)
      This records extensive logistic and training help on the part of  the
      German government: the only passage with any  specific  relevance  to
      the problems faced by minorities refers to  the  new  police  academy
      seeking out candidates from ethnic minority groups.

   c) Defend America (US Dept of Defense News About the War on Terrorism)
      (8 October 2004)
      This recounts, with a certain  amount  of  lip-smacking  detail,  the
      relatively glamorous costume favoured by new female recruits  to  the
      Afghan police. We were rather amused, but not much assisted by it.

   d) 'The Hindu' International: article 'Afghan Sikhs seek overland  entry
      to India' (25 October 2004)
      This quotes [        ] (accepted by those appearing for the claimants
      as the same person referred to in KK 04/258)  as  referring  to  "...
      only a hundred families that had come back after the  ouster  of  the
      Taliban regime. They still faced  hardships  in  getting  back  their
      homes, shops and other assets".

4. The only material referred to on behalf of any of  the  claimants  which
   calls for notice is the passage at � 38 of  IB & TK [2004]  UKIAT  00150
   (referred to in the passage cited above as IB 150),  dealt  with  in  KK
   04/258 at � 22 as follows:

   So far as ISAF [International Security Assistance Force]  is  concerned,
   the Tribunal in IB 150 at � 38 make clear that  they  do  not  intervene
   unless asked to do so by the interim administration,  and  there  is  no
   evidence of any such requests. While so far the street violence suffered
   by Sikhs and Hindus is not too serious, the fact that it occurs  at  all
   in the form related by [     ] suggests at least  a  perception  on  the
   part of Muslim  hooligans  that  their  victims  will  not  receive  any
   effective protection  from  the  State  authorities;  and  without  that
   perception, such incidents might not happen. It certainly does not  show
   any deliberate systematic persecution on the part of those  authorities;
   but it does show a real risk of lack of effective  protection  from  the
   system in place. To use a perhaps rather superficial  analogy,  this  is
   not by any means Germany 1941; but it may be Germany 1936.

5. We asked whether there were any further material directly bearing  on  [
      ], whose evidence had been crucial to the result  in  KK  04/258.  We
   were surprized to hear from Miss Jones (for two of the claimants in  the
   cases before us) that this gentleman had recently  been  interviewed  at
   the British Embassy in Kabul. That was exactly the sort of step we hoped
   would be taken, once our decision in KK 04/258 went  out;  but  we  were
   even more surprized to hear from Mr Sheikh that he was unable to tell us
   anything about the result of the interview than that he was  unaware  of
   any disclosable material resulting from it. At our invitation,  he  made
   further inquiries: we indicated that we would  willingly  put  back  the
   morning's cases till later in the day, so that any disclosable  material
   received could be considered; but Mr Sheikh, no doubt realistically, was
   unable to hold out any such hope.


6. The system of "country guidance" cases, including 'follower' lists  such
   as that in which these  appeared,  depends  on  parties  doing  what  is
   necessary to get their material  before  the  Tribunal  when  cases  are
   listed. Under r. 40.2 of the Procedure Rules,  we  are  not  to  adjourn
   hearings "... unless satisfied that the appeal ... cannot  otherwise  be
   justly determined." That shows the importance placed  by  Parliament  on
   prompt decision-making. The [       ] interview,  so  far  as  we  could
   discover, had taken place about a fortnight before our hearing.  It  was
   obviously likely to be   of considerable importance to the cases  before
   us: given modern instantaneous means of communication, we saw no  reason
   why it should not have been made available at the  very  latest  by  the
   time we sat in the afternoon, and refused any further adjournment for it
   to be produced. We very much hope that this will be done  in  good  time
   for future cases of this kind.

7. Mr Sheikh was inclined  to  criticize  our  decision  in  KK  04/258  as
   excessively "subjective" in its approach to the  question  of  effective
   protection (see Horvath [2000] Imm AR 552 (HL)).  The  short  answer  to
   that is that any real excess in that direction would have been  a  clear
   error of law, which would no  doubt  have  led  to  an  application  for
   permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal; but that did not happen.  A
   somewhat longer answer is to be found in KK 04/258 � 22, set out  above,
   to which we see no need to add anything now. The remaining general point
   he made was that, the [       ] incidents having happened in May -  June
   this year, there had been nothing heard of any further  ones.  The  time
   will come when such a point would have some real force; but that is  not
   yet. Given the terms in which KK 04/258  was  written,  we  think  those
   acting for the present claimants are entitled to rely on the [         ]
   incidents as still relevant to the present situation.

8. It follows that the success or otherwise of Mr Sheikh's arguments in the
   cases before us depends on whether or not we take the  further  evidence
   to which we were referred as affecting the validity of  the  conclusions
   in KK 04/258. The State  Department  report  certainly  shows  that  the
   Afghan authorities are prepared to try to protect the gurdwara  and  its
   worshippers: though they were not able either to prevent or  detect  the
   grenade attack, that would not necessarily indicate a general failure of
   effective protection. However, the decision in KK 04/258 depended not on
   the authorities' ability or willingness to provide  protection  for  one
   conspicuous target; but on a lack  of  commitment,  actual  as  well  as
   perceived, to the protection of religious minorities  generally.  We  do
   not think that what may  or  may  not  be  adequate  protection  of  one
   conspicuous target affects the validity of that decision.

9. So far as ethnic minority recruitment to the  police  is  concerned,  no
   doubt if successful it will change attitudes for the better in the  long
   run (just as it has in this country); but there is nothing to show  that
   so far it has got beyond a declared intention to attract such cadets  to
   the new academy. On what 'The Hindu' quotes  [         ] as  saying,  we
   take Miss Baruah's point that it does not purport to be a complete  text
   of his remarks; and we also note that  it  (as  the  headline  suggests)
   mainly refers to the concerns he raised with the Indian  Government.  We
   do not think it shows that by 25 October he no  longer  regarded  casual
   street violence against Sikhs as the serious problem it had been in  May
   and June.


10. It follows that we see no present reason to  revise  the  general  views
   expressed in KK 04/258. That may change in the light of any  significant
   developments on the  interview  with  [         ],  or  in  the  general
   background situation; or even, in time, if there is nothing  further  to
   indicate any continuing risk for Sikhs generally on return to Kabul.  As
   this is the conclusion we have reached, there is no need in these  cases
   for us to consider  any  individual  features  they  may  have,  or  the
   situation elsewhere in Afghanistan.
