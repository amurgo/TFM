Upper Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber)    Appeal Number: HU/12111/2015


                            THE IMMIGRATION ACTS


                                   Before

                          UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE blum

                         (anonymity direction MADE)
                                                                   Appellant

                           ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER
                                                                  Respondent


                            CONSENT TO WITHDRAWAL

    1.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (Respondent),  by  means   of   the
       update/skeleton argument dated 25 September  2017,  has  decided  to
       withdraw the decision of 30 October 2015  refusing  the  Appellant's
       entry  clearance  application  because,  on  the  totality  of   the
       evidence, it  is  now  accepted[1]  that  the  Appellant  meets  the
       requirements for entry clearance under paragraphs 309A  and  310  of
       the immigration rules (HC 395).


    2. The Respondent has invited the Upper Tribunal to consider whether it
       should exercise its discretion and allow for the withdrawal  of  the
       Respondent's case from its own jurisdiction  with  reference  to  SM
       (withdrawal of appealed decision: effect) Pakistan  [2014]  UKUT  64
       (IAC). In a letter dated 27 September 2017, received  by  the  Upper
       Tribunal on 28 September 2017, the Appellant's legal representatives
       indicated that the Appellant agreed to the Respondent's withdrawal.


    3. In directions issued to both parties on 9  October  2017  the  Upper
       Tribunal indicated its preliminary view that there was no need for a
       further hearing and that the Upper Tribunal would  consider  whether
       to exercise its discretion to allow the Respondent to  withdraw  her
       case on  the  basis  of  the  documents  provided  by  the  parties,
       including the Appellant's representations contained  in  the  letter
       dated 27 September 2017. Both parties were  given  until  Friday  13
       October 2017 to make representations as to  whether  they  agree  to
       this proposed course  of  action.  The  Upper  Tribunal  received  a
       further  letter  from  the  Appellant's  representatives,  dated  12
       October 2017,  agreeing  to  the  proposed  course  of  action,  and
       repeating their view, expressed in their earlier  letter,  that  the
       Respondent's  update/skeleton  argument  represented  a   full   and
       accurate rendering of the law  and  its  application  regarding  the
       entry of de facto adopted children to the UK. There were no  further
       representations from the Respondent.


    4. Pursuant to Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008, and having regard to  the  documentation  before  me  and  the
       representations of the parties, and in  light  of  the  Respondent's
       decision  to  withdraw  the  underlying  decision   refusing   entry
       clearance on the basis that  the  requirements  of  the  immigration
       rules have been met, I give my consent to the withdraw of the  ECO's
       case.


    5. Given the history of this matter and the issues involved, and having
       regard to TPN (FtT appeals - withdrawal) Vietnam [2017]  UKUT  00295
       (IAC), I now provide a brief outline of the reasons for my decision.



Factual background

    6. The Appellant was born in November 2009. NS and RN are his aunt  and
       uncle (RN's brother is the Appellant's biological father). NS and RN
       are also the Appellant's sponsors in his entry clearance application
       as his 'de facto adoptive parents' as described in paragraph 309A of
       the immigration rules (HC 395). On 13  August  2015,  the  Appellant
       applied for entry clearance under paragraph 310 of  the  immigration
       rules as a child who had undergone a 'de facto' adoption.


    7. NS and RN are unable to have children of their  own.  In  2009  they
       were informed by RN's brother that his wife was pregnant with  their
       2nd child.  Because  RN's  brother  and  his  wife  were  struggling
       financially, and because of her  health  issues,  they  offered  the
       Appellant to NS and RN.  A  guardianship  appointment  was  made  in
       respect of NS and RN on 13 February 2010. An earlier application and
       subsequent appeal was unsuccessful because neither  NS  or  RN  were
       British citizens (as they were both PBS migrants the application was
       not made under paragraph 310) and because immigration  judge  Bennet
       was not satisfied there had been  a  genuine  transfer  of  parental
       responsibility.


    8. NS and RN naturalised as British citizens in 2013. In November  2013
       they returned to Pakistan to  undertake  the  Appellant's  full-time
       care and live with him. Guardianship and permission to relocate with
       the Appellant was confirmed by a Pakistani Court on 7 April 2014. On
       13 August 2015, the Appellant applied for entry clearance  on  a  de
       facto adoption basis.

The refusal of entry clearance and the First-tier Tribunal decision

    9. The Respondent refused the application on  the  basis,  inter  alia,
       that there had not been a de facto adoption, and that there  was  no
       Certificate of Eligibility, required in the circumstances  described
       in paragraph 309B of the immigration rules (with  reference  to  the
       Adoption and Children Act 2002 (ACA 2002) and the Adoptions  with  a
       Foreign Element Regulations 2015). The decision (which was a refusal
       of a human rights claim) was appealed to the First-tier Tribunal but
       the First-tier Tribunal, in a decision promulgated on 13 June  2017,
       dismissed the appeal.


   10. It is not  necessary  to  consider  in  any  detail  the  First-tier
       Tribunal's decision. It was agreed by  both  representatives  at  an
       'error of law' hearing in the Upper Tribunal (permission having been
       granted by the First-tier Tribunal on 6 July 2017) before myself  on
       1 September 2017 that the First-tier Tribunal decision was  infected
       by material legal  errors  (a  conclusion  with  which  I  expressed
       complete agreement). In a decision promulgated on 7 September 2017 I
       gave a brief decision identifying the various material legal  errors
       committed by the First-tier Tribunal judge. The reasoning  contained
       in this judgment is annexed to this  decision.  Given  the  relative
       complexity  of  issues  the  matter  was  adjourned  to  enable  the
       Respondent's representative to obtain instructions from the relevant
       policy department  and  for  further  evidence  to  be  gathered  in
       preparation for a de novo hearing before the Upper Tribunal.


   11. On 25 September 2017, the Upper Tribunal received  the  Respondent's
       update/skeleton argument indicating that  she  was  withdrawing  the
       refusal of entry clearance because, on the totality of the  evidence
       provided post October 2015, the  Respondent  now  accepts  that  the
       Appellant meets the  requirements  of  the  immigration  rules,  and
       setting out broad reasons for this conclusion.

Legal framework

   12.  The  principles  issues  in  contention  related  to   the   proper
       interpretation of paragraphs 309A and 309B of the immigration rules.
       At the date of the Respondent's decision these rules read:


         309A. For the purposes of adoption under paragraphs 310-316C a de
         facto adoption shall be regarded as having taken place if:


         (a) at the time immediately preceding the making of the application
         for entry clearance under these Rules the adoptive parent or
         parents have been living abroad (in applications involving two
         parents both must have lived abroad together) for at least a period
         of time equal to the first period mentioned in sub-paragraph (b)(i)
         and must have cared for the child for at least a period of time
         equal to the second period material in that sub-paragraph; and


         (b) during their time abroad, the adoptive parent or parents have:


             (i) lived together for a minimum period of 18 months, of which
             the 12 months immediately preceding the application for entry
             clearance must have been spent living together with the child;
             and


             (ii) have assumed the role of the child's parents,  since  the
             beginning of the 18 month period, so that  there  has  been  a
             genuine transfer of parental responsibility.


         309B. Inter-country adoptions which are not a de facto adoption
         under paragraph 309A are subject to the Adoption and Children Act
         2002 and the Adoptions with a Foreign Element Regulations 2005. As
         such all prospective adopters must be assessed as suitable to adopt
         by a competent authority in the UK, and obtain a Certificate of
         Eligibility from the Department for Education, before travelling
         abroad to identify a child for adoption. This Certificate of
         Eligibility must be provided with all entry clearance adoption
         applications under paragraphs 310-316F.

   13. Section 83 of the Adoptions and Children Act  2002  (ACA  2002),  as
       amended by the Children and Adoption Act 2006, reads,


       Restriction on bringing children in

         1) This section applies where a person who is habitually resident
            in the British Islands (the "British resident")


          a) brings, or causes another to bring, a child who is habitually
             resident outside the British Islands into the United Kingdom
             for the purpose of adoption by the British resident, or


          b) at any time brings, or causes another to bring, into the
             United Kingdom a child adopted by the British resident under
             an external adoption effected within the period of twelve
             months ending with that time.

            The references to adoption, or to a child adopted, by the
            British resident include a reference to adoption, or to a child
            adopted, by the British resident and another person.


         2) But this section does not apply if the child is intended to be
            adopted under a Convention adoption order.

Analysis

   14. The Respondent accepts that the applicable version of paragraph 309B
       was that in force when the entry clearance application was  made  in
       August 2015, as the updated version that came into force on  the  24
       November 2016 (as inserted by HC 667) only applies  to  applications
       made on or after 24 November 2016.

   15. The Respondent accepts that the scenarios covered by the  provisions
       of paragraphs 310 to 316F of the immigration rules are (a) de  facto
       adoptions, (b) where a child is adopted outside the UK according  to
       a law that is recognised by the UK; (c) where a  child  is  entering
       for the purpose of adoption; and (d) Hague Convention adoptions.


   16. The Respondent accepts  that  the  only  circumstances  in  which  a
       Certificate of Eligibility is required are those where  an  adoption
       has taken place less than 12 months before the  date  on  which  the
       child will be entering the UK, and where a prospective  adopter  has
       gone overseas for a meeting with a child identified as suitable  for
       them to adopt and whom they are now bringing  into  the  UK  for  an
       adoption  in  the  UK.  This  flows  from  the  specific   statutory
       requirements in s.83(1) of the ACA 2002,  read  with  the  Adoptions
       with a Foreign Element Regulations 2005. I note from  the  facts  of
       this case that  the  sponsors  had  not  adopted  the  Appellant  in
       Pakistan and they did not intend obtaining an adoption order  but  a
       Special Guardianship Order (SGO)  in  the  UK,  which  can  only  be
       applied for once a child is present in the UK.


   17. Significantly, an adoptive parent  who  meets  the  requirements  of
       paragraph 309A(a) & (b) is not habitually resident in the UK at that
       point and is therefore not caught within the jurisdictional  element
       of s.83(1). This approach is consistent with the  majority  decision
       of the Supreme Court in B (A child), Re [2016] UKSC 4. S.83  applies
       when the adoptive parents and the adoptive child do  not  share  the
       same habitual residence. As a  result,  the  question  of  "habitual
       residence" does not arise in this case, or indeed in this  class  of
       cases, by virtue of  compliance  with  the  temporal  and  residency
       requirements  in  the  immigration  rules.  The  sponsors  did   not
       therefore have to produce a Certificate of Eligibility.


   18. The Respondent accepts that the requirement of paragraph  309A(b)(i)
       should be interpreted flexibly and, on the facts of this case, there
       was no dispute over the breaks in residence declared by the sponsors
       during the time residing in Pakistan since  November  2013.  I  note
       that paragraph 309A simply  requires  that  the  de  facto  adoptive
       parents are or have been  'living  abroad'  and  that  there  is  no
       stricture that their residence is 'continuous'.


   19. The Respondent accepts that recognition of a de facto  adoption  for
       immigration purposes does not  confer  any  legal  status  upon  the
       relationship  between  the  child  and  sponsors.   The   Respondent
       emphasises that where a child is granted Leave To Enter on the basis
       of a de facto adoption the sponsoring parents  should  notify  their
       local  social  services  of   the   child's   presence   and   their
       circumstances. Section 14A(7) of  the  Children  Act  1989  provides
       that, before any application for a SGO is lodged with the court, the
       proposed guardians must give notice to the local authority 'in whose
       area [the child] is ordinarily resident'. When that notice is given,
       the proposed guardians are assessed by the local authority.  On  the
       facts of this case the sponsors intimated their intention to seek  a
       SGO in respect of the Appellant from an English  court  as  such  an
       order was congruent with their faith.


   20. The Respondent acknowledges that the definition of "a parent" in the
       immigration rules includes where a parent is the  subject  of  a  de
       facto adoption in accordance  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph
       309A. It is also clear that the terms of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-
       SE (both in maintenance thresholds and evidential requirements)  are
       not directly applicable to an application under paragraph 310.

   21. Given the totality of the evidence that is  now  available  in  this
       case, and having regard to the previous decision of  Judge  Bennett,
       the Respondent accepts that the sponsors have  resided  in  Pakistan
       with the Appellant for the required period of 12 months  before  the
       application (19 September  2014  to  19  September  2015)  and  have
       resided together in Pakistan for 18 months prior to the  application
       (19 March  2014  to  19  September  2015).  The  Respondent  further
       accepts, based on all the evidence, including the reports  of  Sadia
       Tehseen (15 April 2017) and  Dr  Khan  (8  August  2015),  that  the
       sponsors have discharged  the  burden  of  demonstrating  that  they
       assumed parental responsibility for  the  child  for  the  requisite
       period and that there  has  been  a  genuine  transfer  of  parental
       responsibility. In  reaching  this  conclusion  the  Respondent  has
       specifically considered  the  decision  of  judge  Bennett  and  the
       evidence of the biological parents clarifying paragraph 3  of  their
       previous statutory declaration dated 20 April 2010. I agree with the
       Respondent's analysis contained in her skeleton  argument  dated  25
       September 2017.

   22. In respect of paragraph 310 of the immigration rules the  Respondent
       accepts that all  the  requirements  have  been  met  including  the
       maintenance requirements. I agree with this analysis. The  financial
       evidence  properly  considered  indicates  that  the  sponsors   can
       adequately  maintain  the  Appellant  in  the  UK.  The   Respondent
       specifically notes NS's consistent monthly earnings from his company
       as well as his dividend payments evidenced at �12,000 (30 June  2015
       to 18 March 2016) and �16,500 (31 August  2016  to  3  April  2017),
       which are also consistent with the  historical  financial  evidence.
       The Respondent  additionally  notes  the  income  derived  from  the
       renting of the UK property (�10,800 in  the  last  financial  year).
       Applying  Jahangara  Begum  and  Others  (maintenance   -   savings)
       Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00246 the Respondent accepts that NS has  had
       surplus money in his account in excess of �6000 since August 2016 as
       well as the potential to earn more money from his company  by  being
       present in the UK. The Respondent finally notes  the  evidence  from
       the application that it is proposed that  the  current  tenant  will
       move out from the rented property  once  the  Appellant  is  granted
       entry clearance. The accommodation requirements are therefore met.

Conclusion

   23. I am satisfied that the Respondent's update to the Tribunal/skeleton
       argument, as  summarised  above,  sets  out  a  clear  and  accurate
       statement of the  effects  of  section  83  of  the  ACA  2002,  and
       paragraphs 309A and 309B (as it was) of the immigration  rules,  and
       that the requirements of paragraph 310 are met in this case. In  the
       circumstances I am entirely satisfied  that  it  is  appropriate  to
       consent to the Respondent's withdrawal of her case before the  Upper
       Tribunal.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  in
this appeal is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.  This
direction applies both to the Appellant and to the  Respondent.  Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Signed                                  Date

Upper Tribunal Judge Blum


ANNEX: REASONING IN 'ERROR OF LAW' DECISION, 7 September 2017

                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal R Hussain  (the  judge),  promulgated  on  13  June  2017,
        dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision
        taken on 30 October  2015  to  refuse  his  application  for  entry
        clearance.


     2. At the date of the judge's decision the Appellant, a male  national
        of Pakistan, was 7� years old. NS and RN are the  Appellant's  aunt
        and uncle (RN's brother is the Appellant's biological  father)  and
        the Appellant's sponsors in his entry clearance  application.  They
        are, it is claimed, his 'de facto adoptive parents' as described in
        paragraph 309A of the immigration rules (HC 395).


     3. On 13 August 2015 the Appellant applied for entry  clearance  under
        paragraph 310 of the immigration rules (HC 395) as a child who  had
        undergone a 'de facto' adoption pursuant to paragraph 309A  of  the
        immigration rules, and  under  paragraph  297  of  the  immigration
        rules. The application  was  accompanied  by  a  detailed  covering
        letter from the  Appellant's  solicitors  identifying  the  various
        documents provided in support  of  the  application,  the  relevant
        legal framework, and describing the background to the  application,
        as summarised below.


     4. NS and RN have been married since 1996. They moved  to  the  UK  in
        2007, NS as a Points Based Migrant and RN as his dependent. NS  and
        RN are unable to have children of their  own.  In  2009  they  were
        informed by RN's brother that his wife was pregnant with their  2nd
        child. RN's brother that his  wife  were  however  struggling  both
        financially and as a result of her health issues. As a  consequence
        they offered the Appellant to NS and RN.  It  is  claimed  that  RN
        assumed care for the Appellant when he was 2 days old and that  the
        Appellant has never lived with his  birth  parents  and  has  never
        known them as his parents.  An  adoption  deed  was  created  on  8
        January 2010 although this  has  little  legal  effect  given  that
        adoption is forbidden under Islamic law (instead there  exists  the
        concept of kefalah (Islamic guardianship) which  provides  children
        with a permanent kafil responsible for taking care  of  them  until
        they reached adulthood). A guardianship  appointment  was  made  in
        respect of NS and RN on 13 February 2010.


     5. In 2010 NS and RN applied for entry clearance for the Appellant  to
        join them in the UK as their adopted child. At  the  time  of  this
        application NS was resident in the UK as a Tier 2  Migrant  and  RS
        was resident as his dependent. This application was refused  on  24
        May 2010 and an appeal was dismissed on 27 January 2011 by Judge of
        the First-tier Tribunal N J Bennet.


     6. NS and RN naturalised as British citizens in 2013. In November 2013
        they both returned to Pakistan to undertake the  Appellant's  full-
        time care  and  live  with  him.  Guardianship  and  permission  to
        relocate with the Appellant was confirmed by a Pakistani court on 7
        April 2014. On 13 August  2015  the  Appellant  applied  for  entry
        clearance on the  basis  that  the  requirements  for  a  de  facto
        adoption of him by NS and RN were met.


     7. The basis for the Respondent's refusal of entry  clearance  is  set
        out in the decision letter dated  30  October  2015  and  an  Entry
        Clearance Manager's review dated 15 July 2016. The  Respondent  did
        not accept that there had been a de facto adoption on the  somewhat
        cryptic  basis  that  the   sponsor's   circumstances   were   "not
        necessarily a true reflection" of their actual  circumstances.  The
        Respondent  referred  to  inconsistencies  between   the   previous
        application and the present application as to whether the Appellant
        had been living with his biological parents. The Respondent was not
        satisfied  that  the  sponsors  demonstrated  that  they  had  sole
        responsibility  for  the  Appellant's  care.  The  absence   of   a
        Certificate of Eligibility, required in the circumstances described
        in paragraph 309B of the immigration rules, was said to be fatal to
        the application (with reference to the Adoption  and  Children  Act
        2002  (ACA  2002)  and  the  Adoptions  with  a   Foreign   Element
        Regulations 2005). Nor was it accepted that there were any  serious
        and compelling or other considerations such as to satisfy paragraph
        297(i)(f)  of  the  immigration  rules.  Nor  was  the   Respondent
        satisfied  that  there  would  be  adequate  maintenance  for   the
        Appellant without recourse to public  funds.  The  application  was
        finally refused  on  the  basis  that  there  were  no  exceptional
        circumstances capable of giving rise to a grant of entry  clearance
        under Article 8 ECHR.


     8. At the appeal hearing on the 26 April 2017 the judge  considered  3
        bundles of documents which included, inter  alia,  the  application
        covering letter, the application form and supporting documentation,
        a social work report in respect of the Appellant written  by  Sadia
        Tehseen and dated 15 April 2017, a report by Dr Jonathan Fluxman in
        respect of the state of health of the Appellant's mother  dated  22
        April  2017,  and  a  medical  report  and  prescription  for   the
        Appellant's paternal grandmother dated 14 April 2017. NS gave  oral
        evidence at the hearing. At the end of the hearing  Ms  Cronin  was
        given permission to adduce further  submissions  on  the  issue  of
        habitual residence and paragraph 309B and to provide  some  missing
        bank documents.


     9. The judge considered the decision by Judge Bennett as his  starting
        point, pursuant to  Devaseelan  [2002]  UKIAT  00702.  Despite  the
        sponsors' claim to have relocated to Pakistan in November 2013  the
        judge found that NS continued to be habitually resident in  the  UK
        because his business operated from the UK and because he  continued
        to own residential property in the UK, pay  UK  tax  and  regularly
        returned in connection with his business. The judge found  that  NS
        appeared to have "a  far  greater  presence  in  the  UK"  then  he
        claimed. As a result of his habitual residence the judge found that
        NS was required under paragraph 309B to have obtained a Certificate
        of Eligibility pursuant to the Adoptions  with  a  Foreign  Element
        Regulations 2015 demonstrating that he and  RN  had  been  suitably
        assessed, even if NS was also habitually resident in Pakistan.  The
        judge rejected any reliance by the Appellant on paragraph 310(i)(g)
        because he considered that this envisaged  a  situation  where  the
        adoptive parents were subject to some form of  immigration  control
        and, as both sponsors were British citizens, they  could  not  seek
        admission to the UK for settlement. The judge found  there  was  no
        genuine transfer  of  responsibility  from  the  Appellant's  birth
        parents to the sponsors having regard to the  social  work  report.
        The judge attached little weight  to  the  medical  opinion  of  Dr
        Jonathan Fluxman because there had been no physical examination  by
        Dr Fluxman and because of a  significant  gap  in  the  information
        provided.


    10. Given the Appellant's circumstances in Pakistan the judge concluded
        that  there  were  no  serious  and  compelling  family  or   other
        considerations making his exclusion from the  UK  undesirable.  The
        judge  additionally  concluded,  having  regard  to  the  financial
        documents before him he believed he was entitled to consider,  that
        the Appellant would not meet the adequate maintenance  requirement.
        In so concluding the judge also  found  that  the  bank  statements
        before him did not cover the actual date  of  the  decision.  Given
        that a rental income relied on by the  sponsors  derived  from  the
        property in which it was proposed that the  Appellant  reside,  the
        judge concluded that  the  manner  in  which  the  maintenance  and
        accommodation requirements were said  to  be  met  appeared  to  be
        mutually exclusive. The judge finally considered  article  8  ECHR.
        While being satisfied that family life existed in  so  far  as  the
        Appellant lived as part of the sponsors' family  in  Pakistan,  the
        judge found there were no compelling circumstances  not  recognised
        under the immigration rules sufficient to warrant a grant of  leave
        to remain outside of the immigration rules. In  so  concluding  the
        judge observed that the refusal of entry clearance did no more than
        preserve the status quo and that there was an absence  of  evidence
        that the Appellant or  his  sponsors  would  face  any  significant
        difficulties in maintaining and furthering their family  life  with
        each other either by continuing  the  current  arrangements  or  by
        making a further application for entry clearance having obtained  a
        Certificate of Eligibility.

    11. The Appellant sought permission to appeal the judge's decision  and
        permission was granted by  Judge  of  the  first-tier  Tribunal  JM
        Holmes on 6 July 2017. It is not necessary for me  to  rehearse  in
        any detail the grounds because both Mr Jarvis and Ms Cronin  agreed
        at the outset  of  the  "error  of  law  hearing"  that  the  judge
        materially erred in law, and that it would be necessary to  have  a
        de novo hearing. Having considered in  detail  the  decision  under
        appeal I indicated my preliminary view, independently reached, that
        the judge had indeed committed a number of  material  legal  errors
        rendering the decision unsafe. In these  circumstances  it  is  not
        necessary for me to embark on a lengthy examination of the decision
        and the following points are a summary of the more egregious errors
        committed by the judge.


    12. Although recording Ms Cronin's submissions as to the  applicability
        of the version of paragraph 309B in  force  when  the  Respondent's
        decision was made it is, at the very  least,  unclear  whether  the
        judge did apply that version. In setting  out  the  relevant  legal
        framework at [2] the judge only includes the iteration of paragraph
        309B that came into force on the 24 November 2016 (as  inserted  by
        HC 667). It is however apparent from the terms of HC 667  that  the
        new version of paragraph 309B only applies to applications made  on
        or after 24 November 2016. Having set out the version in  existence
        at the date of the decision  at  [16],  the  judge  then  considers
        guidance  as  to  the  construction  of   the   immigration   rules
        established in Mahad v ECO [2010] 1 WLR 48 (at [17]) and finds that
        the purpose behind s.83 of the ACA  2002  (which  criminalises  the
        bringing into the UK of a child  habitually  resident  outside  the
        British islands by a person  who  is  habitually  resident  in  the
        British islands for the purpose of adoption) is to prevent  persons
        habitually resident in the UK from travelling abroad and adopting a
        child without being assessed as suitable  (at  [18]).  Despite  the
        wording at the start of paragraph 309B suggesting that the need for
        a Certificate of Eligibility does not apply to de facto  adoptions,
        the judge fails to adequately grapple with that construction or the
        arguments advanced by Ms Cronin to the effect that the sponsors had
        no intention of adopting the Appellant in  the  UK  and  that  s.83
        therefore does not apply to them. Nor is it readily  apparent  that
        the judge appreciated that the sponsors were not seeking  to  adopt
        the Appellant in the UK but to apply  for  a  special  guardianship
        order.  It  was  incumbent  on  the  judge  to  engage  with  these
        submissions and to give reasons for  rejecting  the  interpretation
        argued for by the Appellant. His failure to  do  so  constitutes  a
        material error of law.


    13. In concluding that, as British citizens, neither NS  nor  RN  could
        seek admission to the United Kingdom for the purpose of settlement,
        the judge failed to consider the  definition  of  'settled  in  the
        United Kingdom' in paragraph  6  of  the  immigration  rules  which
        requires a person to be ordinarily resident.  The  failure  by  the
        judge to consider paragraph 6 of the immigration rules  constitutes
        a material error of law.


    14. In concluding that NS appeared to have a far  greater  presence  in
        the UK than claimed [14] the judge failed to take into account  the
        totality of the evidence before him including the schedule at  page
        96 of the Appellant's main bundle indicating that NS had only  been
        absent from Pakistan and in the UK for 65  days  and  that  he  had
        lived in Pakistan with the Appellant for 3 � years, and the  nature
        of the transactions in NS's bank account between November 2013  and
        October 2015 (composed of  Internet  transactions  or  transactions
        debited to his accounts immediately after his  short  visits).  Nor
        was any satisfactory  consideration  given  by  the  judge  to  the
        evidence before him supporting the assertion that there had been  a
        genuine transfer of parental responsibility. In concluding that  NS
        had "a far greater presence in  the  UK  than  claimed"  the  judge
        additionally acted in a procedurally unfair manner  by  failing  to
        give NS  an  opportunity  to  deal  with  this  observation,  which
        intimated dishonesty on the part of NS.

    15. The judge additionally concluded (at [22]) that there were no  bank
        statements covering the actual date of  decision  and  that,  as  a
        result the judge was not  satisfied  that  the  sums  in  the  bank
        statements were actually available on the date of  decision.  There
        is however no requirement in the immigration rules that there  must
        be documentary evidence showing the sums available to an  applicant
        on the actual  date  of  an  ECO  decision.  Given  that  financial
        documents would have to be obtained prior to an  application  being
        made it would usually be impossible to provide documentary evidence
        of the sums actually available on the date of  an  entry  clearance
        decision. To the extent that the judge  appears  to  have  required
        documentary evidence of the sums available on the  actual  date  of
        decision, he erred in law. The judge has additionally erred in  law
        by restricting his consideration of the rental income  received  by
        the sponsors to the tax year 2015  -  2016.  This  is  because  the
        appeal  is  a  human  rights  appeal  following   the   significant
        amendments wrought to the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
        2002, which came into force on 6 April 2015. Although a  First-tier
        Tribunal  judge  was  previously  able   to   consider   only   the
        circumstances appertaining at the date of the  decision  to  refuse
        entry clearance, this restriction was lifted in  respect  of  human
        rights appeals after 6 April 2015. As such  the  judge  misdirected
        himself in  law  at  [7]  and  at  [22]  in  stating  that  he  was
        constrained at looking at matters as at the date of decision.  This
        constitutes another  material  error  of  law.  I  am  additionally
        satisfied that the judge failed to consider the  sponsors'  savings
        income held in their savings  account,  a  relevant  consideration,
        when determining that the income support threshold was not met.


    16. I am additionally satisfied that the judge failed to take  adequate
        and holistic account of both the social worker report  prepared  by
        Sadia Tahseen and the medical opinion prepared by Dr  Fluxman.  The
        social worker noted the modest nature  of  the  biological  parents
        shared home, the biological father's  limited  earnings,  that  the
        family struggled to meet their daughter's medical  and  educational
        costs, and the presentation of the  biological  mother's  state  of
        health. Nor has  the  judge  given  adequate  consideration  to  Dr
        Fluxman's medical opinion given that the medical expert had  before
        him medical reports prepared by the biological mother's doctor  and
        unchallenged diagnostic blood and liver function tests. These  were
        relevant considerations that the judge ought  to  have  taken  into
        account in determining what weight he could attach to  the  medical
        opinion. The judge's failure to take into account the  unchallenged
        and independent evidence relating to the biological mother's  state
        of health constitutes a material error of law, as does his  failure
        to holistically consider the totality of the evidence  produced  by
        the Appellant, including that of the sponsors, suggesting that  the
        biological mother may suffer from a serious condition rendering her
        incapable of looking after the Appellant.


    17.  I  am  finally  satisfied  that  the  judge's  assessment  of  the
        proportionality of the refusal of entry clearance  decision  failed
        to take sufficient account of the strength of the  sponsors'  links
        with the UK and  their  status  as  British  citizens,  or  to  the
        difficulties that they would experience if they had  to  relinquish
        their home and business in the UK and relocate to Pakistan.


    18. Having accepted that the judge's decision was vitiated  by  various
        significant  legal  errors  Mr  Jarvis  was  also  in   substantial
        agreement with Ms Cronin as to the  appropriate  way  forward  with
        this appeal. Given the complexity of the issues in  contention  and
        his  inability,  as  at  the  date  of  the  hearing,   to   obtain
        instructions from the relevant policy department, Mr Jarvis invited
        me to set aside the judge's decision in full and adjourn the matter
        to a future date to enable  the  Tribunal  to  fully  consider  the
        relatively complex legal arguments. Ms Cronin  indicated  that,  to
        her knowledge, there was no reported Family Law  decision  relating
        to the interpretation of s.83 of the ACA  2002.  Having  considered
        the submissions from the parties and having regard to the issues in
        contention I consider it appropriate to adjourn the  matter  to  be
        heard de novo before the Upper Tribunal.
