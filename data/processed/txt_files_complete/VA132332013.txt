Representation
For the Appellant:     Sponsor: Mr Nazmul Haque
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on 22 January 1991. His
    appeal against the entry clearance officer's refusal of his application
    for an entry clearance to enter the UK for a  period  of  four  to  six
    weeks  was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in   a   decision
    promulgated on 2 October 2014.

 2.  The  Tribunal  was  not  satisfied  that  he  had  addressed  specific
    credibility issues in the appeal that cast doubt on the genuineness  of
    the visit.

 3. On 1  December  2014,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Levin  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal. He noted that the Tribunal  incorrectly
    applied the conversion rate in  assessing  the  appellant's  income  in
    Bangladesh; further, the finding that the  appellant  had  provided  no
    evidence of earnings from his poultry farm ignored sale  receipts  that
    had been provided by the appellant; they took  into  account  the  fact
    that the appellant's wife was pregnant in  making  adverse  credibility
    findings [13] when in fact the pregnancy arose only after the  date  of
    the decision.

    Hearing on 13 January 2015

 4.  Mr  Nazmul  Haque,  the  sponsor,   relied   on   the   "grounds   for
    reconsideration." He is the appellant's brother in  law.  He  submitted
    that at the time that the application was refused, namely  on  18  June
    2013, the appellant's wife was not pregnant. She only found out she was
    pregnant in September 2013 and the child was born on 25 June  2014.  At
    paragraph 13, the Tribunal  noted,  when  considering  the  credibility
    issues, that the appellant stated that he was travelling alone  without
    his family, even though his wife was  pregnant.  That  was  incorrectly
    taken into account, as the appellant's wife was  not  pregnant  at  the
    application date.

 5. He further submitted  that  the  Tribunal  erred  with  regard  to  the
    appellant's income. The latter had provided  evidence  of  earnings  in
    respect of his poultry farm. That was in fact  already  stated  in  the
    'cover letter' that was submitted along with the application.

 6. Moreover, he stated that there was a fully paginated bundle provided to
    the Tribunal which included sales receipts,  income  tax  certificates,
    income tax receipts and trade licences. He contended  that  the  income
    tax receipts - set out from pages 23 and following of  the  appellant's
    bundle - clearly showed how much tax 'contributions' he had made.

 7. Further, the Tribunal incorrectly stated that the  claimed  income  was
    �118 a month [9], whereas in fact it was the rate of exchange that  was
    pointed out to be BDT 118 to �1. That was  the  rate  at  the  time  of
    refusal. It had never been stated in the application form or in any  of
    the documents provided that the appellant earns �118 a month.

 8. He referred to paragraph 9 of the  determination,  where  the  Tribunal
    stated that the appellant has been employed 'since 2001'. That was  not
    correct. He was employed since June 2011.

 9.  The  Tribunal  also  stated  [9]  that  the  appellant  submitted  his
    daughter's letter from school confirming her  attendance.  However,  no
    such letter was submitted from the school. The appellant does not  have
    a daughter. He has a son, who is not at school.

10. He referred to paragraph 12 of the  determination  where  the  Tribunal
    considered the withdrawal of BDT 180,000. The conclusion  that  he  had
    inflated his account to facilitate his application was  incorrect.  The
    concerns of the ECO had  been  addressed  and  were  explained  in  the
    covering letter at the time of  the  application  and  at  the  appeal.
    Further, the appellant had provided a cheque copy as well as a  deposit
    slip which was not taken into consideration.

11. All that happened was the money was  drawn  from  the  appellant's  own
    Agrani Bank account and deposited into  his  Pubali  Bank  account.  He
    simply withdrew money from one account to another.  He  had  maintained
    the Agrani Bank for a long period and  therefore  had  savings  in  the
    latter account. He has been in  employment  since  2011  and  had  also
    received additional income from land. That amount had accumulated  over
    the years. This evidence was also before the Tribunal.

12. Mr Haque repeated that the relevant documentation was 'all  available'.
    He, as sponsor gave evidence about these matters, all of which had been
    set out in  his  witness  statement.   That  included  the  explanation
    relating to  the  large  deposits  into  the  appellant's  Pubali  Bank
    account.

13.  Moreover,  the  appellant  had  produced  his  monthly  salary   sheet
    describing "pay and allowances" of the appellant as a manager of  Pinne
    Electric. This identified his salary, showing a consistent amount being
    received between January 2013 and  December  2013.  There  was  also  a
    similar salary sheet for the year 2012. The documents relating  to  the
    Agrani Bank Ltd have been translated and confirm the  transfer  of  the
    money  from  that  account  "to  self".  The  cheque  evidencing   that
    transaction was also provided, showing the payment on 13 May 2013  from
    the appellant's Agrani Bank account to his other account.

14. The subsequent deposit into the Pubali Bank account has been  confirmed
    by the  document  at  page  17  of  the  bundle  which  has  also  been
    translated. The translator's signature has been attested  by  a  notary
    public. There are tax receipts issued to the  appellant  for  the  year
    2013/14 as confirmed in a document translated at page 20. Finally there
    was documentation relating to the renewal of the poultry  farm  licence
    at page 26. The appellant is also a member of  the  Sylhet  Chamber  of
    Commerce and Industry which is certified in a certificate.

15. At paragraph 13, the Tribunal found that the appellant did not  explain
    why he was not travelling with his family and who would look after  his
    wife in her condition. Apart from the fact that she was not pregnant at
    the time, the sponsor had stated at the hearing  that  the  appellant's
    wife has her in-laws to take care  of  her.  His  whole  family  is  in
    Bangladesh to look after her  for  the  four  to  six  weeks  that  the
    appellant intended visiting the UK.

16. Mr Bramble accepted that there had been an error  with  regard  to  the
    findings relating to the  appellant's  wife's  pregnancy.  However,  he
    submitted that the Tribunal was entitled to dismiss the appeal  on  the
    basis of the genuineness of the proposed visit as  there  had  been  no
    proper clarification of the appellant's earnings.

    Assessment

17. Having considered the competing submissions, I find that  the  Tribunal
    has made material errors of law. It is common ground that the  Tribunal
    had wrongly stated that the appellant was travelling alone even  though
    his wife was pregnant. At the date of refusal - 18 June 2013 - his wife
    was not even pregnant. She became pregnant in September  2013  and  the
    child was born on 25 June 2014, well before the date of the hearing.

18. That finding cast doubt on the genuineness of  the  visit.  They  found
    that he did not adequately explain why he was not travelling  with  his
    family, and who would look after his wife 'in her condition'. There was
    no such 'condition' at the date of application or at the  date  of  the
    hearing. There was  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  from  the  sponsor
    himself stating that the appellant would be leaving  behind  his  wife,
    with whom he has a strong bond as well as his parents.  He  had  strong
    ties in Bangladesh.

19. Further, the Tribunal stated that the appellant provided no evidence to
    support his earned income  as  he  had  not  provided  any  documentary
    evidence to support all of his  earnings,  and  in  particular  poultry
    earnings. However, the documentation provided in that respect  included
    evidence  of  regular  payments  into  the  appellant's  bank  account,
    including the transfer of 180,000 taka to his other account  on  3  May
    2013 (page 22).

20. More significantly, there was evidence produced in the bundle  relating
    to the appellant's poultry farm including his income tax  certificates.
    The documentation included the appellant's tax identification  as  well
    as his business identification numbers. He  has  completed  assessments
    for the years 2011-12 and 2012-13. It is certified that he has paid all
    income tax and advance tax up to the assessment year  2013  (page  23).
    Moreover, there was an updated income tax certificate  with  regard  to
    the assessment of 2013-14 (page 24).

21. Pages 21-22 of the bundle contained documentation that showed  evidence
    of regular payments into his account by way of cash deposits  referable
    to sales from his business. The amount of tax paid in  respect  of  the
    2012-13 tax year is set  out  at  page  18  containing  a  tax  receipt
    confirming that 18,800 taka was received from the appellant  under  the
    various  Tax  Acts  for  that  period.  That  equates  to  about  �150.
    Similarly, in 2013-14, it is shown that he paid  36,000  taka  for  the
    year 2013-14.

22. I have had regard to the entry clearance manager's report. The  manager
    was concerned that no evidence as to  the  source  of  funds  had  been
    provided in respect of the balance of about �2,152. It is asserted that
    the  balance  was  thus  not  a  true  reflection  of   his   financial
    circumstances and had been inflated to facilitate the application. That
    contention was upheld by the Tribunal.

23. However, the sponsor had produced a statement with regard to the  large
    deposit into the Pubali Bank. This  was  simply  a  transfer  from  the
    appellant's other account. That had been stated in the covering  letter
    submitted by Immigration Aid when the application  was  presented.  The
    appellant also submitted handwritten bank statements from  Agrani  Bank
    Ltd. Moreover, a copy of  his  cheque  showing  the  deposit  into  the
    account was produced.

24. Having found that there were material errors of  law  involved  in  the
    making of the first-tier Tribunal's decision, I set it  aside  and  re-
    make it.

25. The sponsor is a British citizen, settled with his family. He has given
    a detailed witness statement. The appellant is his brother in law.  The
    appellant intends to stay with him and visit his family in the  UK.  He
    will maintain him for the period he is here.  There  is  no  suggestion
    that the sponsor is not financially able to maintain or accommodate him
    for the short period.

26. The appellant has his own business in Bangladesh and is also a  manager
    at Tinne Electric. He receives an income from both his  employment  and
    from his business. This is not a fixed amount  and  varies  each  month
    depending on sales. He has savings in his bank account.

27. I find that the appellant has produced evidence of  his  earnings  from
    his poultry farm. The  income  tax  certificates  before  the  Tribunal
    reflect income from that source. The appellant has set  out  his  total
    monthly income from all sources, including from his  poultry  farm,  at
    page 4 of his application. That is consistent with the tax receipts  he
    has produced. He has produced sale receipts, income tax certificates as
    well as tax receipts. The evidence adduced shows he  earns  BDT  12,000
    per month from his employment, which is  about  �101.  The  balance  is
    earned from sales from his farm.

28. He has moreover explained the large deposit of  BDT  180,000  into  his
    Pubali Bank account. This was transferred from his other account.

29. I  thus  find  that  the  appellant  is  in  full  time  employment  in
    Bangladesh. His family lives in Bangladesh; this includes his wife  and
    young child.

30. I have also had regard to the witness statement from  Mr  Haque,  whose
    evidence I accept. He has previously invited family members to the  UK.
    They subsequently visited the UK and all returned  timeously  and  have
    never breached the applicable conditions. He maintained that  he  is  a
    credible sponsor and would not ruin his reputation as such.   He has  a
    positive track record in that respect.

31. He stated for example that he was the main sponsor in unrelated appeals
    that came before the Tribunal. Both appeals were allowed and one of his
    cousins who had already visited the UK returned within his time  limit.
    He also provided accommodation for another appellant, whose appeal  was
    also allowed.

32. I have no reason to suppose that the intentions of  the  appellant  are
    anything other than those which he has given. He is financially  stable
    in Bangladesh. His wife, child and the rest of his family live together
    in Bangladesh. From his and his sponsor's evidence I am satisfied  that
    he will return after his trip.

33. I accordingly find that the decision  of  the  respondent  was  not  in
    accordance with the law and the immigration rules applicable.

    Notice of Decision

    Having set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, I re-make  it
    and substitute a decision allowing the appellant's appeal.

    No anonymity direction is made.
