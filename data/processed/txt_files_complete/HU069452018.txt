Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Nigerian national who entered the United Kingdom  as
    a minor with his mother in June 2006, aged 14 years of age.  On  August
    1, 2012 he claimed asylum but this was refused on August 14, 2012.   He
    appealed that decision and his appeal ultimately was allowed  on  human
    rights grounds (Article 8 family life) by the Tribunal on  January  31,
    2013 and he was given discretionary leave to remain until  October  17,
    2015.

 2. On September 24, 2015 the appellant applied for further leave to remain
    and this was refused by the respondent on February 26, 2018.

 3. The appellant appealed this decision on March 16,  2018  under  Section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  and  his
    appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hudson on September
    10, 2018 and in a decision promulgated on September 14, 2018 the  Judge
    dismissed his appeal.

 4. Grounds of appeal were lodged by the appellant with the  assistance  of
    his mental care co-ordinator  on  September  28,  2018.   Within  those
    grounds it was  stated  that  the  appellant  had  been  sectioned  and
    detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 on September  4,
    2018.  At the date of hearing on September 10, 2018 the  appellant  was
    therefore unable  to  attend  or  provide  instructions  to  his  legal
    representatives as he was an in-patient at Stepping Hill Hospital.   On
    September 28, 2018 the  appellant  and  his  mental  care  co-ordinator
    attended at his home address and discovered that his  appeal  had  been
    dealt with in his absence.

 5. In granting permission to appeal Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Smith
    extended time to file the appeal due to the fact the appellant was in a
    secure psychiatric hospital at the date when his appeal was  heard  and
    found it was arguable there  had  been  procedural  unfairness  and  in
    particular that the Judge had attached significance  to  the  fact  the
    appellant had not attended the hearing and had concluded the  appellant
    was in reasonable health.

 6. No anonymity order is made.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

 7. It was apparent from the  court  file  that  on  August  23,  2018  the
    appellants former representatives had written to the Tribunal and  that
    letter had been received the same day.  According to  that  letter  the
    appellant  was  feeling  unwell  and  was  unable  to  attend  at   his
    representatives to provide  instructions.   They  confirmed  that  they
    would not be attending his final hearing.

 8. In proceeding on September 10, 2018, the Judge noted that the appellant
    had not attended and at paragraph 16 recorded that  the  appellant  was
    "currently in reasonable health and compliant with his medication".

 9. It is apparent from the current appeal grounds that the  appellant  was
    far from being in reasonable health in that he had been sectioned under
    the Mental Health Act.

10. Mr Tan, on behalf of the respondent, accepted that  there  had  been  a
    procedural unfairness with the  Judge  unwittingly  proceeding  in  the
    appellant's absence.  The appellant was entitled to attend the  hearing
    and was entitled to give oral evidence and the fact he  was  unable  to
    because he was detained under the Mental Health  Act  meant  there  had
    been a procedural unfairness.

11. I briefly considered whether to retain jurisdiction in this matter  but
    concluded that this case should be  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal under Section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement
    Act 2007 as a full hearing including oral evidence will  need  to  take
    place.  Mr Tan did not disagree with this course of action.

12. The case should be listed before a Judge other than Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal A R Hudson.

Notice of Decision

There is an error in law.  I set aside the original decision and  remit  the
matter  back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  Section  12(1)  of   the
Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.


Signed                              Date 07/02/2019
