                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    None


  CONSENT TO WITHDRAWAL OF THE APPELLANT'S CASE (PURSUANT TO RULE 17(2) OF
        THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008 AS AMENDED

 1. The Respondent's application for entry clearance had  been  refused  by
    the ECO  Mumbai.   Her  appeal  against  that  decision  was  heard  at
    Birmingham by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Rose.  In  a  decision
    promulgated on 30th July 2014 the appeal was allowed.  The  essence  of
    the issue in question was whether  the  Respondent's  Sponsor  met  the
    maintenance requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  set  out  in
    Appendices FM and FM-SE to those Rules.

 2. The Secretary of State sought to appeal that decision on the  basis  of
    the interpretation put by Judge Rose upon paragraph 13(a)(i) of  FM-SE.
    Permission to appeal was granted to the  Secretary  of  State  on  18th
    August 2014 and the matter was subsequently listed to be decided in the
    Upper Tribunal and on this basis came before me.

 3. However in the meantime it is apparent  from  correspondence  from  the
    Respondent's solicitors that she made a further application  for  entry
    clearance which was duly granted.  Her solicitors applied  to  withdraw
    the appeal before the Upper Tribunal but were correctly  informed  that
    only the Secretary of State could withdraw the appeal, which  had  been
    made at her instigation.  The appeal thus remained listed.

 4. At the hearing before me Mr Smart, on behalf of the Secretary of State,
    said that although it was clearly arguable that on  the  basis  of  the
    Rules in place as at the date of decision under appeal that  the  point
    was arguable, in the light of further amendments to the  Rules  he  was
    not seeking to pursue the appeal. He therefore applied to withdraw  the
    case pursuant to Procedure  Rule  17(2).   It  was  apparent  from  the
    correspondence from the Appellant's solicitors that  she  consented  to
    withdrawal (which she herself had sought).

 5. I accordingly consented to withdrawal of the Secretary of State's  case
    in its totality.  There is now no issue to  be  decided  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal and these proceedings are therefore at an end.

No anonymity direction is made.
