Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms K McCarthy, Counsel, instructed by SP Law
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is a remade decision following the identification of a material
       error of law in the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fox
       (the judge), promulgated on 13 July 2018, dismissing the appellant's
       appeal against  the  respondent's  decision,  dated  13  July  2017,
       refusing to issue him a residence card pursuant to  the  Immigration
       (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (the 2016 Regulations)  as
       confirmation of his right to permanently reside in  the  UK  as  the
       dependant family member of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights.


    2. In an error of law decision promulgated on 21 November 2018 I  found
       that the judge failed to  identify  anywhere  in  his  decision  the
       relevant 5-year period during which the appellant had to demonstrate
       dependency on his sponsor (his  daughter,  an  EU  national  with  a
       permanent right of residence in the UK) in accordance with Reg 15 of
       the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016.  The
       appellant entered the UK on 16 June 2011  in  receipt  of  a  Family
       Permit, was issued with a  residence  card  on  13  July  2012,  and
       therefore had to show that he was a dependent up to and including 16
       June 2016. The judge's decision, read  holistically,  did  not  show
       that he got to grips with the relevance of the  5-year  time  period
       from 16 June 2011 to 16 June 2016,  and,  specifically,  the  period
       from February 2014, when the  appellant  ceased  to  live  with  the
       sponsor, to 15 June 2016. While the judge was not  assisted  by  the
       dearth  of  evidence  relating  to  the  relevant  period,   it   is
       nevertheless insufficiently clear whether he appreciated the need to
       focus on the period from February 2014 to June 2016.

    3. Given the lack of focus in the documentary  evidence  I  decided  to
       adjourn  remaking  the  hearing  and  gave  permission  for  further
       evidence to be adduced relating to the issue of  dependency  in  the
       period from February 2014 to June 2016.

    4. The resumed hearing was listed for 15 January  2019.  In  accordance
       with my directions  the  appellant  provided  a  further  bundle  of
       documents running to 311 pages. This included, inter  alia,  further
       statements from  the  appellant  and  his  sponsor,  copies  of  the
       appellant's bank account statements covering  the  relevant  period,
       copies of  the  appellant's  wife's  bank  statements  covering  the
       relevant period, copies of the appellant's payslips and  his  wife's
       payslips covering the relevant period, copies of the sponsor's  bank
       account statements and a P60  covering  the  relevant  period,  and,
       significantly, evidence of the appellant's ISA account covering  the
       relevant period. The ISA account showed a balance of �616.85  on  17
       February 2014, rising to �1,522.36 on 17 June 2014,  then  �3,027.61
       on 17 September 2014, �5,031.11  on  17  October  2014,  and  rising
       steadily to �10,077.19 on 17 April 2015 and then  �16,073.86  on  17
       May 2016.


    5. In her  skeleton  argument  prepared  for  the  resumed  hearing  Ms
       McCarthy accepted that the evidence showed that  the  appellant  was
       not financially dependent for the purposes of EU law on his  sponsor
       in the  relevant  period  because  he  and  his  wife  were  earning
       sufficient money to meet their essential needs. This  was  confirmed
       by Ms McCarthy orally at the hearing. In light of the evidence,  and
       the principles established in Lim v Entry Clearance  Officer  Manila
       [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 relating to dependency, Mr McCarthy's  position
       was one she was bound to take.


    6. Ms McCarthy invited me to dismiss the appeal. She invited me however
       to make the following findings, and, after  some  discussion,  there
       was no objection from Mr Whitwell. The findings are consistent  with
       the evidence that was provided to both the First-tier  Tribunal  and
       the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  consistent  with  the  retained  factual
       findings made by the First-tier Tribunal. I find the following.

   i) There was no evidence in this case of abuse or attempted abuse of EEA
      rights;


  ii) The evidence showed that the appellant was genuinely a member of his
      daughter's household in Italy and, initially, in the UK and he was
      correctly given residence on that basis;


 iii) Even after the appellant and his sponsor moved to separate households
      the appellant's sponsor continued to give him some financial support,
      even though this was not indispensable for his essential needs,


  iv) Even after the appellant and his sponsor moved to separate households,
      they continued to be close to one another, including regular visits by
      the appellant's sponsor to see and support her half-siblings (the
      appellant's children).
