For the Respondent:    Mr O'Ryan, Counsel, instructed by Access Immigration
Law


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The Respondent, his wife, and son, are citizens of Ghana.

      2. The Respondent first came to the UK as a visitor on 10 April  1999,
         in order to write a project report at  Durham  University.  Between
         1999 and 2002 he made a number of visits to the UK as  part  of  an
         agricultural research project, funded by the DFID.

      3. On 5 October 2002 the Respondent was granted leave to  enter  until
         11 March 2003, and he returned to Ghana on 4 March 2003.

      4. On 16 February 2004 the Respondent was granted leave to enter as  a
         student until 30 January 2005 in  order  to  study  for  a  Masters
         degree in geography at Durham University. That course of study  was
         eventually completed in July 2005, and the degree for which he  had
         commenced studying in 2004 was eventually awarded to him in January
         2006 [25].

      5. The Respondent then enrolled upon a  further  course  of  study  at
         Durham University for a PhD. The Respondent completed his work upon
         his thesis, and submitted it on April 2013.  He  must  undertake  a
         viva examination upon his thesis, and then complete any corrections
         or amendments required of the thesis by his examiners, before  that
         PhD can be awarded to him. He must also have a grant  of  leave  to
         remain in the UK before the University will arrange a viva for  him
         in country, and as is now accepted he has been an overstayer in the
         UK since May 2012.

      6. The Appellant had applied in time for a variation of the  grant  of
         leave made to him in February 2004, and his leave was  duly  varied
         until 30 April 2009. A further in time application for a  variation
         of his grant of leave was refused by the Appellant  in  July  2009,
         but the Respondent  successfully  appealed  that  decision  to  the
         Tribunal on 30 September 2009, and thus in February 2010 his  leave
         was duly varied, until 30 May 2012.

      7. On 28 May 2012 the Respondent sought advice from Durham  University
         on the application he proposed to make for a variation of his leave
         [ApBp51]. It is plain that he was advised, correctly,  of  the  fee
         due of �394, and also that he had not yet made such an application.
         The same day the Respondent purchased postal orders payable to  the
         Appellant, for �386 [ApB p55]. The application form is date stamped
         as having been received by the Appellant on 30 May 2012 [ApB p56].

      8. Although the Respondent therefore submitted an  application  for  a
         further variation of his leave to remain before 30 May 2012, it was
         properly rejected by the Appellant on 31 May  2012  as  an  invalid
         application because he had failed to submit the  correct  fee  [ApB
         p95]. The fee required was �394, but the fee tendered was �386.

      9. The Respondent accepts in consequence  that  his  leave  to  remain
         therefore expired on 30 May 2012 and that as a result he became  an
         overstayer on that date.  Thus  the  continuous  period  of  lawful
         residence that he had accrued by that date, was the period from  16
         February 2004 until 30 May 2012 -  a  period  of  just  over  eight
         years.

     10. On 8 June 2012, and thus as an overstayer, the  Respondent  applied
         for further leave to remain  as  a  student.  His  application  was
         refused on 1 November 2012 without any in country right  of  appeal
         because  he  had  no  valid  leave  to  remain  when  he  made  the
         application. His application was  considered  but  refused  on  its
         merits because he  had  failed  to  demonstrate  that  he  had  the
         requisite funds available to him, with the requisite  evidence.  He
         had failed  to  provide  any  personal  bank  statements,  and  had
         supplied in support of the application only bank statements  for  a
         Ghanaian bank account held by a company, "Acheelistics Ventures".

     11. The Respondent lodged an application for  judicial  review  of  the
         decision to refuse him an in country right  of  appeal,  which  was
         refused on 15 April 2013  [ApB  p127].  HHJ  Gosnell  refused  that
         application on the bases; i) the Appellant was  perfectly  entitled
         to reject as invalid the May 2012 application for failure to tender
         the correct fee, ii) the June  2012  application  was  made  as  an
         overstayer, and so whilst there was a discretion to consider it  on
         the merits, there was no right of appeal against its refusal,  iii)
         the  bank  statements  submitted  in  support  of  the  June   2012
         application disclosed no obvious connection to the Respondent. Even
         if he had a right  of  appeal,  the  application  would  have  been
         refused quite properly on that basis.

     12. On 25 March 2013, and thus as an overstayer, the Respondent applied
         for a grant of indefinite leave to  remain  pursuant  to  paragraph
         276B of the Immigration Rules, which  was  refused  on  16  October
         2013. In consequence a decision was  taken  on  the  same  date  to
         remove him to Ghana as an overstayer.

    The Respondent's wife and son

     13. The Respondent's wife was first  granted  entry  clearance  as  his
         dependent in 2002. She returned to Ghana with him  in  March  2005,
         and she gave birth to their son in Ghana on 2 June  2005.  She  and
         the child remained in Ghana, although the  Respondent  returned  to
         the UK to resume his studies.

     14. The Respondent's wife and son were granted entry clearance  as  the
         Respondent's dependent on 17  July  2008.  Their  leave  to  remain
         expired alongside his own on 30 May 2012. Since that date, they too
         have been overstayers. It would appear that no separate application
         was made by  them  for  leave  to  remain  in  March  2013.  If  an
         immigration decision has been made in relation to them,  they  have
         made no appeal to the Tribunal against it.

    The appeal

     15. The Respondent's appeal against the  immigration  decisions  of  16
         October 2013 was heard on 6 January 2014. It  was  dismissed  under
         the Immigration Rules, but allowed  on  Article  8  grounds,  in  a
         Determination promulgated on 17 January 2014 by First Tier Tribunal
         Judge Henderson.

     16. By a decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge Simpson  dated  3  April
         2014 the First Tier Tribunal granted the  Appellant  permission  to
         appeal on the basis it was arguable the  Judge  had  erred  in  her
         approach to the Article 8 appeal, and had treated this as  a  "near
         miss" to the requirements of the Immigration Rules, and had  failed
         to identify any compelling circumstances why the appeal  should  be
         allowed outside the Immigration Rules.

     17. The appeal was first called on before me for  hearing  on  17  June
         2014,  but  during  the  course  of  argument  as  to  whether  the
         Determination disclosed a material error  of  law  in  the  Judge's
         approach to the Article 8 appeal, it was noted that the  Judge  had
         made reference to, and apparently relied upon, the decision of  the
         Upper Tribunal in Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy)  [2013]  UKUT  42,
         which had  been  overturned  by  the  subsequent  Court  of  Appeal
         decision of Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2. The Respondent sought, and
         was granted, an adjournment of the  hearing  in  the  interests  of
         fairness in order that Counsel might consider the  implications  of
         that point, and because if the conclusion was that the Tribunal had
         erred it was by then plain that there was inadequate court time  in
         which to rehear the Article 8 appeal. Permission was granted to the
         Appellant to amend the  grounds  of  challenge  to  the  Tribunal's
         decision, to take that point (the Respondent having argued that  it
         was not open to her to do so pursuant to the  application  for,  or
         grant of, permission to appeal) and Directions were  made  for  the
         relisting of the appeal.

    The appeal under the Immigration Rules

     18. It was not in dispute before  me  that  the  Respondent  became  an
         overstayer  on  30  May  2012,  and  that  he  did  not  meet   the
         requirements of paragraph 276B of the  Immigration  Rules  for  the
         grant of indefinite leave to remain  that  he  had  sought  by  his
         application of 25 March 2013. Put simply he did not then have,  and
         could never reasonably have persuaded himself that he did have, the
         period of continuous lawful leave required by paragraph  276B.  The
         March 2013 application he made was always doomed to failure, and he
         and his then solicitors (Blavo  &  Co,  who  are  not  his  current
         representatives) must always have realised that.

     19. Again it was not in dispute that the Respondent did  not  meet  the
         requirements of either paragraph 276ADE,  or  Appendix  FM  of  the
         Immigration Rules, either when he made  his  application  in  March
         2013, or, when his appeal was heard  by  the  Tribunal  in  January
         2014.

     20. It was thus accepted by Mr O'Ryan that the Tribunal was correct  to
         so conclude, and, that this should have been the context  in  which
         the Article 8 appeal was considered by  the  Tribunal  outside  the
         Immigration Rules.

    The Article 8 appeal outside the Immigration Rules

     21. It is accepted on the Respondent's behalf by  Mr  O'Ryan  that  the
         decision to remove him to Ghana never posed an interference in  his
         "family life" enjoyed by the Respondent  with  his  wife  and  son,
         since the Respondent would be able to remove the  family  together.
         It is accepted on the Respondent's behalf  that  the  appeal  could
         only properly have been considered on  Article  8  grounds  on  the
         basis that the removal decision  constituted  interference  in  the
         Respondent's "private life".

    Error of Law?

     22. In consequence of the acceptance that this was only ever a "private
         life" appeal, the Judge ought to have considered the appeal in  the
         light of the guidance to be found in the decision  of  the  Supreme
         Court in Patel [2013] UKSC 72, to which there is  no  reference  in
         her  Determination.  The  following  statements  of  principle  are
         relevant;

             "a near-miss under the rules cannot  provide  substance  to  a
             human rights case which is otherwise lacking in merit" [56].

             "It is important to remember that article 8 is not  a  general
             dispensing power. It is to be distinguished from the Secretary
             of State's discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the
             rules, which may be unrelated to any  protected  human  right.
             The merits of a decision not to depart from the rules are  not
             reviewable on appeal: section 86(6). One may  sympathise  with
             Sedley  LJ's  call  in  Pankina  for  "common  sense"  in  the
             application of the rules to graduates who have  been  studying
             in the UK for some years (see para 47  above).  However,  such
             considerations do not by themselves provide grounds of  appeal
             under article 8, which is concerned  with  private  or  family
             life, not education as such. The opportunity for  a  promising
             student to  complete  his  course  in  this  country,  however
             desirable in general terms, is not in itself a right protected
             under article 8." [57]

     23. The Judge was plainly troubled by the explanation given to  her  by
         the Respondent for how the application he had submitted in May 2012
         had been invalid. She noted that the explanation she had been given
         was  not  one  that  was  fully  explained  in   the   Respondent's
         application for judicial review of  the  decision  to  reject  that
         application as  invalid  [28,  33].  Indeed  she  appears  to  have
         accepted that it was inconsistent with  the  explanation  that  was
         offered in that application for judicial review [32]. The  approach
         taken in paragraphs 44 and 50 of her Determination appears to  have
         been to review both the decision to reject the May 2012 application
         as invalid, and the decision to refuse the  June  2012  application
         for failure to meet the evidential requirements of the  Immigration
         Rules.

     24. The Judge appears then to have gone on to consider whether the  May
         2012 application would have succeeded if it had been considered  on
         its merits, and whether  the  decision  to  refuse  the  June  2012
         application would have been subject to  a  successful  appeal.  She
         approached the Article 8 appeal on the basis  that  the  Respondent
         should have been granted the variation to his leave  that  he  then
         sought. Thus she appears to  have  accepted  the  Respondent's  new
         explanation for how the invalid May 2012 application had come to be
         made. Moreover she  appears  to  have  accepted  [29-36]  that  the
         Respondent had assumed that the documents submitted in  support  of
         the June 2012 application would meet the then current  requirements
         set out in the Immigration Rules, because documents  of  that  type
         had been accepted as doing so when submitted in support of previous
         applications for leave to remain. (Those documents related  to  the
         trading  company  in  Ghana  that  the  Respondent  claims  to  own
         outright, and which is the source of the monies used by him to meet
         his tuition fees, and the maintenance in the  UK  of  himself,  his
         wife, and son.) It is implicit in her decision  that  she  accepted
         that  the  documents  he  had  submitted  did  not  meet  the  then
         requirements of the Immigration Rules.

     25. The Judge considered the "PBS Process Instruction"  on  "evidential
         flexibility" and found that the Appellant would hold a "large file"
         upon the Respondent, and that it would be  "reasonable"  to  expect
         the Appellant to be aware of  the  Respondent's  ownership  of  the
         trading  company  in  Ghana,  and  that  it  was  "surprising"  the
         Appellant did not make further enquiries of the  Respondent  before
         making a decision upon his application [36]. It is plain  that  she
         did not consider the decision upon the June 2012 application to  be
         one that was made in accordance with the law, for failure to follow
         the evidential flexibility policy, and that this was the context in
         which she approach the Article 8 appeal, using that  conclusion  to
         attach less weight to the public interest in  the  removal  of  the
         Respondent and his family.

     26. In my judgement, although  the  Judge's  initial  approach  to  the
         Article 8 appeal was quite properly  to  direct  herself  that  the
         Respondent never had any prospect of satisfying the requirements of
         paragraph 276B  [38],  she  nonetheless  fell  into  error  in  her
         approach to the proper context in which that Article  8  should  be
         considered. Article 8 did not afford either the Respondent, or  the
         Tribunal,  the  opportunity  to  simply  side-step  or  ignore  the
         consequences  of  his  acts,  and  his  failure  to  make  a  valid
         application for a variation of  his  leave  within  time,  or,  his
         failure to  support  either  that  application  or  his  subsequent
         application with the evidence required of him under the Immigration
         Rules. Thus the proper context in which the Article 8 appeal should
         have been considered was that the Respondent had been an overstayer
         since 30 May 2012, who had made in March 2013  an  application  for
         indefinite leave to remain that never had any prospect of success.

     27. Instead the Judge's approach to the Article 8  appeal  was;  a)  to
         review the Appellant's decision to reject the May 2012  application
         as invalid, and, b) to review the Appellant's  decision  to  refuse
         the June 2012 application on  its  merits,  and  in  the  light  of
         Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013] UKUT 42, notwithstanding  the
         lack of any right of appeal on the Respondent's part  against  that
         decision, as had been confirmed by the decision of HHJ Gosnell.

     28. The Judge's review of the rejection of the May 2012 application  as
         invalid is plainly based upon the very small shortfall between  the
         fee tendered, and the fee required. As the grant of  permission  to
         appeal identifies, the Judge was adopting a "near miss" approach to
         the fee tendered,  compounded  by  her  approach  to  the  original
         explanation offered by the Respondent to the Court for the  failure
         to tender the correct fee, and her acceptance of a different one. I
         am satisfied that this  aspect  of  the  Judge's  decision  plainly
         failed to apply the guidance of the Court of Appeal in Miah  [2012]
         EWCA Civ 261, as confirmed by the Supreme  Court  in  Patel  [2013]
         UKSC 72; there is no "near miss" challenge open to the Respondent.

     29. The Judge also plainly considered the Appellant's approach  to  the
         June 2012 application in the light of  the  decision  in  Rodriguez
         (Flexibility Policy) [2013] UKUT 42. She could not have been  aware
         of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ
         2, which was promulgated a few days after her own, and in which the
         decision of the Upper Tribunal was overturned. Nevertheless, in the
         light of the decision of the Court  of  Appeal,  her  approach  was
         flawed. It was simply not open to her conclude that  the  Appellant
         had failed to apply its then published policies to  the  June  2012
         application.

     30. Accordingly I am satisfied that the Judge considered the Article  8
         appeal in the wrong context. Thus, the Tribunal's decision  on  the
         Article 8 appeal must be set aside  and  remade.  Having  announced
         that decision to the parties, whilst explaining I would  give  full
         written reasons for it subsequently,  I  heard  evidence  from  the
         Respondent and his wife in relation to the Article 8 appeal.

    The decision remade

         The immigration status of the Respondent's family

     31. There  is  no  need  to  repeat  the  immigration  history  of  the
         Respondent.   The  Respondent's  wife  was  first   granted   entry
         clearance as his dependent in 2002. She returned to Ghana with  him
         in March 2005, and she gave birth to their son in Ghana on  2  June
         2005. She and the child remained in Ghana until they  were  granted
         entry clearance as the Respondent's dependents  on  17  July  2008.
         Their leave to remain expired alongside his own on 30 May 2012, and
         since that date, they too have been overstayers.

         Extended family in Ghana

     32. Both the Respondent and his wife have an extended family in Ghana.

         The best interests of the Respondent's son

     33. The Respondent's son first came to the UK at the age of  three.  He
         has benefited from education at public  expense  in  the  UK  since
         arrival, and he is now aged nine. The Judge found [47]  (and  there
         is no need to revisit these findings) that he had settled  well  in
         the UK, and assimilated the culture. He attended Church and  was  a
         keen footballer, with friends. He prefers to use English,  although
         he is part of a household in which Twi would be  familiar  to  him,
         and that even if he was not fluent in Twi,  he  would  be  able  to
         become fluent upon return.  She  also  found  that  English  is  an
         important language in Ghana, and that he was young enough to  adapt
         to life there.

     34. Following the guidance to be found in EV (Philippines) [2014]  EWCA
         Civ 874 the assessment of his best interests must be  made  in  the
         context that he and his parents  are  Ghanaian  nationals  with  no
         right to remain in the UK. I am satisfied that of his  parents  are
         to be removed it is entirely reasonable to expect him  to  go  with
         them. He has no right, or legitimate expectation  to  education  at
         public expense in the UK, and his best interests are plainly served
         by growing up with his parents. Indeed  upon  return  to  Ghana  he
         would have the additional benefit of growing up within the extended
         family that remain in that country.

     35. There is no suggestion that this boy would face any lack of  safety
         in the event of return to Ghana, and given his  parents'  education
         and relative wealth in the context of Ghana, the evidence does  not
         suggest that he would lack any opportunity there. Indeed given  the
         claims made for his parents' financial circumstances they would  be
         in a position to purchase for him the best education  available  in
         Ghana. There is no evidential basis upon which I could assume  that
         this would be better or worse than that which he  would  obtain  at
         public expense in the UK.

         The Respondent's health

     36. Mr O'Ryan accepts that the  Article  3  threshold  is  not  met  in
         relation to the health of the Respondent.

     37. The Judge appears to have accepted that during the currency of  his
         leave  to  remain  in  the  UK,  in  2006,  the   Respondent   fell
         increasingly ill as a result of a serious  thyroid  condition.  She
         accepted that this condition was sufficiently  serious  to  prevent
         him from studying during 2006 and 2007. The Judge also  appears  to
         have accepted that in February 2011 the Respondent  fell  seriously
         ill once again, this time as a result of a  hand  injury  that  had
         become very badly infected, and that once again  his  studies  were
         seriously disrupted during at least 2011.

     38. As a result of his health issues, Durham University extended to the
         Respondent a series of extensions of time to allow him to  complete
         his studies. Those extensions were relied upon  in  the  series  of
         applications he then made to vary his leave to remain.

     39. The Respondent appears to have accepted before the  Judge,  and  he
         clearly confirmed in the evidence that he gave to me,  that  rather
         than seeking treatment for his thyroid condition in the UK, he  had
         returned frequently to Ghana in order  to  seek  treatment  at  the
         Komfo Teaching Hospital, situated in Komasi, the town in  which  he
         grew up, and in which his parents lived. It  is  not  necessary  to
         undertake an analysis of the stamps in his passport to  reconstruct
         his itinerary, and the number and length of  the  periods  of  time
         spent in Ghana, because the Respondent has made  no  suggestion  to
         the effect that the medical facilities accessible by him  in  Ghana
         were insufficient to meet his needs, either when the effects of his
         thyroid condition, or his hand injury, were  at  their  height,  or
         now. For the avoidance of any doubt I am not satisfied  that  there
         is any medical treatment that the Respondent needs that he would be
         unable to access in Ghana.

     40. It is plain  that  the  Respondent  has  over  the  years  received
         treatment from the NHS in relation to his thyroid condition and his
         hand condition [26]. There is no evidence to suggest,  one  way  or
         the other, that he has paid for any of this privately.

         The health of the Respondent's wife

     41. Mr O'Ryan accepts that the  Article  3  threshold  is  not  met  in
         relation to the health of the Respondent's wife.

     42. The Judge was told by the Respondent's wife in evidence [ApB  p154]
         that  she  had  suffered  a  miscarriage  in  2009,  and  had   not
         subsequently  been  able  to  conceive.  The  couple   had   sought
         specialist medical advice at the Centre for Life  in  Newcastle  in
         December 2012, had been advised to take folic acid supplements, and
         wished and intended to pursue IVF treatment in  the  UK  [14].  The
         Judge accepted that this was a genuine issue of importance  to  the
         Respondent's wife, and that she could apparently only conceive with
         the assistance of IVF treatment, but noted that the evidence before
         her did not establish how  the  proposed  IVF  treatment  would  be
         financed [48].

     43. With the passage of time, matters have moved on.  The  Respondent's
         evidence is now that specialist medical assistance  was  sought  as
         early as March 2012, and after a series of tests, and retests,  the
         couple were advised  in  October  2013  that  they  would  need  to
         undertake IVF treatment in order to have a  realistic  prospect  of
         conceiving. On 28  March  2014  following  further  tests,  further
         specialist advice was provided; that in the light of  the  presence
         of some fibroids in  the  womb  intra-cytoplasmic  sperm  injection
         (ICSI treatment) would be more likely  to  be  effective  than  IVF
         treatment. ICSI treatment began in June 2014 [ApB p197-207].

     44. A June 2013 fee schedule for privately financed fertility treatment
         at the Centre for Life, completed in June 2014  by  the  Respondent
         indicates that the cost of one course of ICSI treatment  is  �4,700
         including drugs required. There is no  schedule  of  the  different
         tests, consultations, and fertility treatments that the  Respondent
         and his wife  have  received  over  the  last  few  years,  and  no
         documentary evidence to corroborate the Respondent's claim that  he
         has paid for all of it from funds drawn by him from his business in
         Ghana, and advances made to him  from  members  of  their  extended
         family. The only receipt produced for such a payment  is  dated  28
         March 2014 for �480, which appears to relate to some  pre-treatment
         tests and the consultation with a Consultant Gynaecologist on  that
         date.

     45. Although it was not immediately successful,  courses  of  the  ICSI
         treatment have now proved to be a success, because the Respondent's
         wife is pregnant and due  to  give  birth  on  15  July  2015.  The
         Respondent  says  in  evidence  however  that  this  pregnancy   is
         complicated by his  wife's  history  of  miscarriage,  and  by  her
         fibroids. Thus he says, although there is no corroborative evidence
         to this effect, that the couple have been  advised  not  to  travel
         away from Durham without an assessment being undertaken of  whether
         it is safe for mother or baby to do so. Whilst the  routine  dating
         scan undertaken on 7  January  2015  revealed  no  issue  with  the
         pregnancy, the Respondent's wife has reported persistent  abdominal
         pain and blood spotting, and the scan confirmed the 2013  diagnosis
         of uterine fibroids so that she has an appointment for  an  anomaly
         scan, and an appointment with a Consultant Gynaecologist booked for
         20 February 2015. There is no documentary evidence to suggest  that
         the Respondent has paid for the post fertility treatment  his  wife
         has received from the NHS.

     46. The Respondent's wife accepts that she has  not  yet  been  advised
         that she needs  any  particular  treatment,  let  alone  specialist
         treatment, and she does not suggest that she has been advised  that
         air travel to Ghana poses any risk to herself or her  baby.  Indeed
         when asked whether she had been given any advice  about  travelling
         she contradicted the claim in the Respondent's  witness  statement,
         and said that she had not - the only advice she  had  received  had
         been to rest, and not to carry anything.  The  Respondent  accepted
         that he did not yet know what, if anything, his wife would  require
         by way of medical treatment in order to be delivered  safely  of  a
         healthy baby. Thus he could not say whether  or  not  that  medical
         treatment would be available to her in Ghana.

     47. For the avoidance of any doubt I am not satisfied that there is any
         medical treatment that the Respondent's wife needs that  she  would
         be unable to access in Ghana.

         The Respondent's income

     48. In Ghana it is accepted that both the Respondent and his wife  held
         employment. There is no suggestion that they  would  be  unable  to
         find employment  there  in  the  future.  Indeed  the  Respondent's
         qualifications ought to place him amongst the elite in  his  field.
         He does not in fairness suggest that he would be unable to do so.

     49. The Judge accepted that the Respondent owned a trading business  in
         Ghana, based primarily in Kumasi, although with a branch in  Accra.
         The Respondent accepted in evidence before me that he  still  owned
         this business, and that it had always been the source of all of the
         funds used by him to pay tuition fees in the  UK,  and  to  support
         both himself, his wife and son in the UK. The  evidence  before  me
         does not allow me to evaluate the profitability of  this  business,
         since  neither  trading  accounts,  nor  tax  returns  for  it  are
         produced, only bank statements. Given  the  Respondent's  claim  to
         have been financed by way of his drawings from this  business  over
         the years, on any view it must be an extremely successful business.
         It is plain that  it  could  only  continue  to  prosper  with  the
         Respondent's  return  to  Ghana  and  ability  to  devote   greater
         attention to its affairs. Moreover there is no  reason  to  suppose
         that it would not continue to provide  the  funds  to  support  the
         lifestyles of the Respondent, his wife and son, and  the  costs  of
         any education, or any medical treatment  that  any  of  them  might
         require. If the funds the Respondent could draw from that  business
         were sufficient to support the family,  his  education,  and  their
         fertility treatment in the UK, as he has claimed, then it  is  self
         evident that there is no basis upon which I  could  find  that  the
         Respondent and his family would lack for anything  upon  return  to
         their extended family in Ghana.

         The Respondent's PhD

     50. The Judge accepted, and again there  is  no  need  to  revisit  the
         finding, that the Respondent's study and  work  upon  his  doctoral
         thesis which had commenced  so  long  ago  had  been  significantly
         delayed as a result of his ill health. The Judge did  not  identify
         however, and perhaps  she  was  never  told,  that  the  Respondent
         commenced work upon his thesis in January 2008, and  had  completed
         his work upon his thesis to the satisfaction of his tutor, and  had
         therefore submitted  the  final  draft  for  consideration  by  his
         examiners on 25 April 2013.

     51. The Respondent accepted in evidence  before  me  that  he  has  not
         undertaken any study since April 2013. The Judge's reference to his
         not having completed his studies is therefore either mistaken, or a
         shorthand reference to the fact that he has not undertaken his viva
         examination upon his completed thesis because of his lack of  leave
         to remain.

     52. The Respondent  accepted  that  he  has  not  been  told  what  (if
         anything) his examiners will require of him by way  of  corrections
         to his thesis. Once any required corrections are undertaken by  him
         then the PhD will be awarded to him, and if none  are  required  of
         him the PhD will be awarded outright.

     53. By undated letter, but written  in  reply  to  an  enquiry  by  his
         solicitor dated  25  June  2014,  Durham  University  set  out  its
         position in relation to the viva examination  that  the  Respondent
         was required to undertake upon his thesis [224]. It  was  confirmed
         that examiners had been selected for the viva. Whilst attendance in
         person at a viva examination was normal, it was confirmed  that  it
         was possible to arrange attendance remotely by video link, with the
         approval of the Deputy Head of Faculty.

     54. There is no evidence to suggest the relevant office holder has ever
         refused such an approval to the Respondent, or that the  Respondent
         has ever requested such an approval. The clear implication  however
         is that Durham University are, and have always been, quite  content
         for the Respondent  to  attend  his  viva  by  video  link.  In  my
         judgement it is plain that it is the Respondent who has refused  to
         entertain that notion, or to pursue it. He does not however a  veto
         in this respect, as Mr O'Ryan accepted. Had the Respondent returned
         to Ghana following submission of his thesis  in  April  2013,  then
         there is no reliable evidence that would allow me to find that  his
         viva would not have taken place by video link that same spring,  or
         early summer.

     55. In the circumstances I  am  satisfied  that  the  Respondent  could
         currently attend his viva examination from Ghana by video link.  He
         has offered no reliable evidence to  suggest  either  that  such  a
         video link facility is not accessible to him in Ghana, or that such
         a means of conducting the viva is not now available to him  because
         of a change in the stance taken by Durham University.

     56. The Respondent argues however that because of the passage  of  time
         he would need to revise for his viva in order to be successful, and
         that he could only do so in the UK, using the facilities  available
         to him in person at Durham University. The  short  answer  to  that
         argument is that the evidence does not  support  the  argument.  He
         obviously has access to his own research, and to  his  own  thesis,
         whether he is in the UK or Ghana. Durham University have  confirmed
         that some of the software used in the data  analysis  is  available
         remotely, and that he could also access the  journals  and  e-books
         available within the University library remotely [ApB p224].

     57. The Respondent  argues  however  in  his  witness  statement  of  3
         November 2014, apparently in an attempt to rebut  the  University's
         evidence, that not all the materials in the University library  are
         available to him online, and that he  was  unable  to  access  even
         those that should be available online when he last tried to  do  so
         from Ghana. The evidence of the University on this issue is however
         rather more reliable, and I prefer it to his. Moreover it is  clear
         to me that he could, if he had wished to take that precaution, have
         kept himself up to date with developments in his  field,  and  with
         his own research, since April 2013. If he has not done so, then  he
         has only himself to blame. As to specific specialist books that are
         not available online, it is not enough to show  that  he  has  made
         reference to some of them in some footnotes to his  thesis,  or  in
         his bibliography - he needs to show some need  to  actually  access
         them from Ghana either for the purpose of revising for the viva, or
         subsequently for the purpose of making corrections to  the  thesis.
         In my judgement he has not done so. There is therefore  no  obvious
         reason why the Respondent could not return to Ghana both ready, and
         able, to undertake his viva successfully remotely by video link.

     58. Although the Respondent claims to have been told that statistically
         those who do so are less successful than those who do so in person,
         there is no reliable evidence to support that claim.  Even  if  his
         belief were accurate, and soundly statistically  based  (he  offers
         none) then  such  statistics  would  not  necessarily  indicate  an
         impediment to those undertaking the viva  in  that  way,  they  may
         merely indicate a trend either in the nature of research  conducted
         remotely, or in how well such students had prepared for  the  viva.
         There could be all sorts of reasons for either of those.

     59. The Respondent's final argument is that he might  not  be  able  to
         make from Ghana the corrections to his thesis  that  his  examiners
         might require of him, due to his inability to access remotely  from
         Ghana some of the specialist software he had used when in Durham to
         marshal his research. This  is  speculation  upon  speculation  and
         there are at least two answers to it.

     60. First, it is at present pure speculation that any corrections would
         be required at  all,  or,  that  any  major  corrections  would  be
         required of him that would require his use of  specialist  software
         to make them. The Respondent's tutor was  presumably  content  with
         the final draft of  the  thesis  he  submitted,  after  so  long  a
         gestation. The Respondent has not offered  any  evidence  from  his
         tutor to suggest that he has reservations about its content,  depth
         or scope. The University policy [ApB p230]  makes  clear  that  the
         examiners would have three choices at the conclusion of  the  viva.
         They could make an unconditional award if the thesis were  free  of
         typographical errors, and they were content  with  it.  They  could
         require minor corrections,  but  these  would  not  entail  further
         research or any further substantial work. It would only be  if  the
         examiners required major  corrections  that  any  further  research
         would, or might be required. There is quite simply no evidence upon
         which I could infer that major corrections would be required of the
         thesis by the Respondent following his viva.

     61. Second, even if major corrections were required, and the Respondent
         needed to access specialist software to do so,  he  has  identified
         only three such software packages. Durham University have confirmed
         that the Respondent would be able to access SPSS software  remotely
         [ApB p225]. The Respondent has  produced  prices  for  single  user
         licence to the two other specialist software packages;  Strata  13,
         and NVivo10. Even if one were to assume that he needed one, or both
         of these packages in addition to SPSS in  order  to  undertake  any
         major corrections to his thesis required of him, and  that  had  to
         buy the licence in Ghana to do so -  the  evidence  shows  that  he
         could afford to do so, and would be able to do so. The price quoted
         for these software packages [ApB p212-215] means that for a man  of
         his means they would be affordable, and thus accessible to him. The
         cost is in fact quite modest compared for example to the  price  of
         airfares to Ghana, or specialist fertility treatment. Whilst I note
         the Respondent's complaints about his difficulties in the  past  in
         accessing a secure internet connection  in  circumstances  allowing
         him to study I am not satisfied that he would be unable to make the
         necessary arrangements should he put his  mind  and  means  to  the
         matter.

     62. In conclusion therefore I am not satisfied the Respondent is unable
         to undertake his viva successfully  from  Ghana,  or  that  he  has
         demonstrated that there is any real impediment to  his  undertaking
         it and thus completing the work needed for the award of his PhD.

    Sections 117A, 117B of the 2002 Act

     63. Since I am remaking the decision after 28  July  2014  I  must  (in
         particular) have regard to the considerations listed  in  s117B  to
         the 2002 Act in considering whether an interference with a person's
         right to respect for private life is justified under Article 8(2).

     64. I note that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
         the public interest; s117B(1). I note that little weight should  be
         given to a "private  life"  established  by  a  person  when  their
         immigration status is precarious or they are in the UK  unlawfully;
         s117B(4)(5).  I  am  satisfied  that  at  all  material  times  the
         Respondent has either had  a  lawful  immigration  status  that  is
         nonetheless precarious, or he has been in the UK unlawfully.

     65. I note that the Respondent's son is not a "qualifying  child",  and
         that his wife is not a "qualifying partner".

     66. The fact that the Respondent  speaks  English,  and  claims  to  be
         financially independent, does not mean that  he  enjoys  thereby  a
         right to a grant of leave to remain  that  he  does  not  otherwise
         qualify for pursuant to the Immigration Rules. Nor do those factors
         give substance to an Article 8 appeal  that  is  otherwise  without
         merit.

    Conclusions

     67. In my  consideration  of  the  Article  8  appeal  pursued  by  the
         Appellant I have to determine the following separate questions:

           . Is there an interference with the right to respect for private
             life  (which  includes  the  right  to  physical   and   moral
             integrity) and family life?

           . If so will such interference have consequences of such gravity
             as to potentially engage Article 8?

           . Is that interference in accordance with the law?

           . Does that interference have legitimate aims?

           . Is the interference proportionate in a democratic  society  to
             the legitimate aim to be achieved?

     68. This is an appeal that turns upon the issue of the  proportionality
         of the decision to remove. I note the guidance to be found upon the
         proper approach to a "private life" case in the decisions of  Patel
         [2013] UKSC 72, and  Nasim  [2014]  UKUT  25.  I  note  the  public
         interest in removal; the following passage in Nasim  sets  out  the
         relevant principles;

             14. Whilst  the  concept  of  a  "family  life"  is  generally
                  speaking readily identifiable, the concept of  a  "private
                  life" for the purposes of Article  8  is  inherently  less
                  clear. At one end of the "continuum" stands the concept of
                  moral   and   physical   integrity   or   "physical    and
                  psychological integrity" (as categorised by the  ECtHR  in
                  eg Pretty v United Kingdom [2002] 35 EHRR 1) as to  which,
                  in  extreme  instances,  even  the  state's  interest   in
                  removing  foreign  criminals  might   not   constitute   a
                  proportionate response. However, as  one  moves  down  the
                  continuum, one encounters aspects of private  life  which,
                  even if engaging Article  8(1)  (if  not  alone,  then  in
                  combination with other factors) are so  far  removed  from
                  the "core" of Article 8 as to  be  readily  defeasible  by
                  state interests, such as the importance of  maintaining  a
                  credible and coherent system of immigration control.

             15. At this point on the continuum the essential  elements  of
                  the  private   life   relied   upon   will   normally   be
                  transposable, in the sense of being capable of replication
                  in their essential respects, following a  person's  return
                  to their home country. Thus, in headnote 3 of MM  (Tier  1
                  PSW; Art 8; private life) Zimbabwe [2009]  UKAIT  0037  we
                  find that:-

                      "3. When determining the issue of proportionality ...
                      it will always be important to evaluate the extent of
                      the individual's social ties and relationships in the
                      UK. However, a student here on a temporary basis  has
                      no expectation of a  right  to  remain  in  order  to
                      further these ties and relationships if the  criteria
                      of the points-based system are  not  met.  Also,  the
                      character of an individual's  "private  life"  relied
                      upon is ordinarily by its very nature of a type which
                      can be formed  elsewhere,  albeit  through  different
                      social ties, after the individual is removed from the
                      UK."

             16. As was  stated  in  the  earlier  case  of  MG  (assessing
                  interference with  private  life)  Serbia  and  Montenegro
                  [2005] UKAIT 00113:-

                      "A person's job and precise programme of studies  may
                      be different in the country to  which  he  is  to  be
                      returned and his network  of  friendships  and  other
                      acquaintances is likely to be different too, but  his
                      private life will continue  in  respect  of  all  its
                      essential elements."

             17. The difference between these types of "private life"  case
                  and a case founded on family life is instructive.  As  was
                  noted in MM, the relationships involved in a  family  life
                  are more likely to be unique, so as  to  be  incapable  of
                  being replicated once  an  individual  leaves  the  United
                  Kingdom, leaving behind, for example, his or her spouse or
                  minor child.

             18. In R (on the application of the Countryside Alliance) v AG
                  and others [2007] UKHL 52, Lord Bingham, having  described
                  the concept of private life in  Article  8  as  "elusive",
                  said that:

                      "... the purpose of the article is in my view  clear.
                      It is to protect the individual against intrusion  by
                      agents of the state, unless for good reason, into the
                      private sphere within which individuals expect to  be
                      left alone to conduct their personal affairs and live
                      their personal lives as they choose" [10].

             19. It is important to bear in mind that  the  "good  reason",
                  which the state must  invoke  is  not  a  fixity.  British
                  citizens may enjoy  friendships,  employment  and  studies
                  that are in all  essential  respects  the  same  as  those
                  enjoyed by persons here who are subject to such  controls.
                  The fact that the government cannot arbitrarily  interfere
                  with  a  British  citizen's  enjoyment  of  those  things,
                  replicable though they may  be,  and  that,  in  practice,
                  interference is likely to  be  justified  only  by  strong
                  reasons, such as  imprisonment  for  a  criminal  offence,
                  cannot be used to restrict  the  government's  ability  to
                  rely on the  enforcement  of  immigration  controls  as  a
                  reason for interfering with  friendships,  employment  and
                  studies enjoyed by a person who is subject to  immigration
                  controls.

             20. We therefore agree with Mr Jarvis that [57] of  Patel  and
                  Others is a significant exhortation from the Supreme Court
                  to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of Article
                  8 and, in particular, to recognise its limited utility  to
                  an individual where one has  moved  along  the  continuum,
                  from that Article's core area of  operation  towards  what
                  might be described as its fuzzy penumbra.  The  limitation
                  arises, both from what will at that point normally be  the
                  tangential  effect  on  the  individual  of  the  proposed
                  interference and from the  fact  that,  unless  there  are
                  particular  reasons  to  reduce  the  public  interest  of
                  enforcing  immigration  controls,   that   interest   will
                  consequently  prevail  in  striking  the   proportionality
                  balance (even assuming that stage is reached).

             21. In conclusion on this first general matter, we  find  that
                  the  nature  of  the  right  asserted  by  each   of   the
                  appellants, based on their desire, as former students,  to
                  undertake a  period  of  post-study  work  in  the  United
                  Kingdom, lies at the outer reaches of cases  requiring  an
                  affirmative answer to the  second  of  the  five  "Razgar"
                  questions and that, even if  such  an  affirmative  answer
                  needs to be given, the issue of proportionality is  to  be
                  resolved  decisively  in  favour  of  the  respondent,  by
                  reference to her functions as the guardian of  the  system
                  of immigration controls, entrusted to her by Parliament.

     69. To the extent that the Appellant relies upon  his  good  character,
         and his desire to undertake  complete  his  PhD  whilst  physically
         present in the UK the following passage in Nasim is applicable;

             25. A further seam running through the appellant's submissions
                  was that, during their time in the  United  Kingdom,  they
                  had been law-abiding, had not relied on public  funds  and
                  had contributed to the United Kingdom  economy  by  paying
                  their students' fees. Their aim was now to  contribute  to
                  that economy by working.

             26. We do not consider that this set of submissions takes  the
                  appellants'  cases  anywhere.  It  cannot  rationally   be
                  contended that their  Article  8  rights  have  been  made
                  stronger  merely  because,  during  their  time  in   this
                  country, they have not sought public funds, have refrained
                  from committing criminal offences and have paid  the  fees
                  required in order to undertake their courses. Similarly, a
                  desire to undertake paid employment in the United  Kingdom
                  is not, as such, a matter  that  can  enhance  a  person's
                  right to remain here in reliance on Article 8.

             27. The only significance of not having  criminal  convictions
                  and not having relied on public funds is to  preclude  the
                  respondent from pointing to any public interest in respect
                  of the appellants'  removal,  over  and  above  the  basic
                  importance of maintaining a firm and  coherent  system  of
                  immigration control. However, for reasons we have  already
                  enunciated, as  a  general  matter  that  public  interest
                  factor is, in the circumstances of these cases, more  than
                  adequate to render removal proportionate.

       70. To sum up then, the appeal does not rely upon the core  concepts
           of moral and physical integrity. In my  judgement  the  evidence
           relied upon does not establish that  there  are  any  compelling
           compassionate circumstances that mean the decision to remove the
           Respondent and his family to Ghana, leads  to  an  unjustifiably
           harsh outcome.

DECISION

    The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    17 January 2014 did not involve the making of an error of  law  in  the
    decision to dismiss the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules  and  that
    decision is accordingly confirmed.

    The Determination did however involve the making of an error of law  in
    the decision to allow the Article 8 appeal that requires that  decision
    to be set aside and remade. I remake that decision so as to dismiss the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds.

Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008

         Unless and until the Tribunal directs otherwise the  Respondent  is
         granted anonymity in the interests of his son. No report  of  these
         proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify any member of the
         family. This direction applies both to the  Appellant  and  to  the
         Respondent. Failure to comply with this  direction  could  lead  to
         proceedings being brought for contempt of court.
