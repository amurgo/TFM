Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms C Record of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer but I will  refer  to
    the original appellant, a citizen of Vietnam born on 27 January 1980 as
    the appellant herein.  On 26  August  2014  he  applied  for  an  entry
    clearance to visit his wife in the United Kingdom.  The application was
    refused on 15 September 2014.  The purpose of the visit had been to  be
    present at the birth of his wife's child.  The couple had  a  son  born
    after the decision on [  ]  2014.   The  appellant's  wife,  a  British
    citizen, had returned to the UK to give birth to the child.

2.   The respondent refused the application on the basis that the  appellant
    had failed to declare on his Visa Application Form  that  he  had  ever
    held any other nationalities.  However checks had  shown  that  he  had
    been served with papers for leave without entry to the UK as a  Chinese
    national  and  this  other   nationality   had   not   been   declared.
    Accordingly, the Entry Clearance Officer stated he  was  "automatically
    refusing this application for entry clearance under  paragraph  320(7B)
    of the Immigration Rules".   Any  future  applications  would  also  be
    automatically refused subject to the relevant requirements of the Rules
    until 19 November 2013.

3.   The Entry Clearance Officer noted the appellant's apology for  claiming
    that he had been a Chinese national and records that he  was  satisfied
    that the appellant was indeed Vietnamese. The  appellant's  credibility
    was  however  undermined  and  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant was being truthful about the  purpose  and
    duration of his proposed visit.  In a previous application for  a  visa
    in August 2013 the visa officer had  considered  that  the  appellant's
    credibility was also undermined by his previous immigration history  in
    that he had a long period of overstay  for  approximately  five  years.
    The circumstances did not indicate that a visit was genuinely intended.
     There was no interference with the appellant's Article 8 rights.

4.   The appellant appealed and at the hearing  of  his  appeal  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal the Home Office Presenting Officer ("HOPO") made an
    important concession.  He accepted that the appellant should  not  have
    been excluded under paragraph 320(7B) because  there  was  no  evidence
    that the appellant had lied about his nationality in connection with an
    application.  The parties were also in agreement that there was  family
    life between the appellant and his wife.  The judge found that the only
    issue for  the  Tribunal  to  determine  was  whether  the  appellant's
    exclusion was proportionate taking account of his ability to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.

5.   The only witness before the judge was the appellant's wife.   She  said
    she had last gone to Vietnam  on  15  October  2015  to  celebrate  the
    child's birthday.  She had returned to the UK on 11 December 2015.  She
    confirmed the appellant had no desire to come  to  the  United  Kingdom
    permanently because he had no knowledge of the language and  could  not
    get a job in this country.  He was a vice director of his company.   On
    the previous occasion her husband had returned to Vietnam  at  his  own
    expense and was not planning to make a settlement  application  in  the
    UK.  She said it was hard for her to travel  with  a  baby.   She  went
    about twice a year to Vietnam.

6.   The judge sets  out  his  reasons  and  conclusions  in  the  following
    extract from his decision:


         "11. I remind myself that the appellant can only appeal  the  entry
             clearance officer's decision on the grounds that the  decision
             breaches his human rights.  I  also  direct  myself  that  the
             appellant carries the burden of proving that he has  a  family
             life that has been interfered with and the burden  is  on  the
             respondent to show that any interference is proportionate.


         12.  In the light of the concession from HOPO  that  the  appellant
             and his wife do enjoy family life, I need  not  carry  out  an
             assessment of that here.  Suffice to say that that  concession
             was properly made given the nature of the relationship between
             the appellant and his sponsor and the frequency of her  visits
             to see him in Vietnam.


         13.  In assessing the proportionality of the appellant's exclusion,
             the HOPO again properly submitted that the appellant's ability
             to satisfy the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rule  namely
             paragraph 41, was crucial.


         14.  In this case, the ECO sought to exclude  the  appellant  under
             paragraph 320(7B) on the grounds that he has previously failed
             to declare that he has another nationality.  Once  again,  the
             HOPO  was  willing  to  concede  that  exclusion  under   that
             provision was wrong because there is simply no  evidence  that
             the appellant had relied on another nationality in  connection
             with an application.


         15.  In my view, that  concession  was  also  properly  made.   The
             burden of  proof  is  on  the  respondent  to  show  that  the
             appellant  had  lied  would  have  required  proof  that   the
             appellant had another nationality which he failed to disclose.
              The respondent's own assertion amounts to no  more  than  the
             appellant, when apprehended, asserting that he was  a  Chinese
             national.  Merely making a claim to being a  national  of  one
             country or another is not  sufficient  proof  of  having  that
             nationality.  Therefore, the appellant quite properly answered
             in the negative the question as  to  whether  he  had  another
             nationality.  The fact that  the  appellant  was  returned  to
             Vietnam and has continued to live there  since  2010  and  has
             applied using a Vietnamese passport, all attest to him being a
             Vietnamese national.


         16.   I  accept  the  presenting  officer's  submission  that   the
             appellant's credibility has been dented by the  fact  that  he
             has overstayed in the United Kingdom by 5 years and  the  fact
             that he tried to  mislead  the  Immigration  authorities  with
             regard to his true nationality.  However, those facts have  to
             be set against other  factors  that  are  in  the  appellant's
             favour.


         17.  These are that the appellant did leave the UK  voluntarily  at
             his own expense.  He has  been  residing  outside  the  United
             Kingdom since 2010 without attempting to return  this  country
             to live permanently.  He is married to a British  citizen  and
             has a British citizen child with whom he  has  a  genuine  and
             subsisting family life.  That family life is being  maintained
             by the sponsor's return visits on a regular basis to  Vietnam.
             She seems to be content with  the  appellant  remaining  there
             where she states that he has a better life.


         18.  The appellant's  evidence  is  that  he  worked  as  a  deputy
             director for  a  company  called  An  Viet  Manufacturing  and
             Trading Joint Stock Company earning 45 million  VN.   He  also
             has amassed a savings of ï¿½10,000.  Those facts  were  revealed
             on his application form and ECO has not  sought  to  challenge
             those.  In my view, this evidence  is  inconsistent  with  the
             appellant having a settled and stable life in Vietnam where he
             holds a good employment position.


         19.  In my view, having balanced the adverse factors against  those
             favourable to him, I have come to the conclusion that  it  has
             not been shown that the appellant's exclusion from the  United
             Kingdom is proportionate.  There is no suggestion that once in
             this  country,  he  cannot  be  maintained  and   accommodated
             either."


7.   The judge accordingly allowed the appeal.  The Entry Clearance  Officer
    appealed submitting that the  judge's  proportionality  assessment  was
    inadequate and there had been  no  interference  with  the  appellant's
    right to family or private  life  because  the  parties  were  free  to
    continue to enjoy that family life as they  had  previously  "construed
    it".  The decision did not interfere with the status  quo.   Permission
    to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal on  19  July  2016  on
    this point.  Counsel settled a Rule 24 response.  In paragraph 8 of the
    response Counsel drew attention to what appears to be  a  typographical
    error in paragraph 18 of the judge's determination.  I accept Counsel's
    point on this matter - in its context the last sentence of paragraph 18
    can only be sensibly read as the judge expressing  the  view  that  the
    evidence was consistent with the appellant having a settled and  stable
    life in Vietnam where he held a good employment position.

8.   Mr Avery submitted that the case raised a narrow point.  The  appellant
    was happy in Vietnam and the sponsor went to visit him twice each year.

9.   Counsel submitted that the judge was  aware  of  the  background.   The
    application had been made to enable the appellant to be present at  the
    birth of the child and to come to see  the  child.   The  child  was  a
    British citizen.  The refusal predated the birth of the child.  It  had
    been conceded that there was no deception.  It was conceded that  there
    was family life.  Being present at the birth of the child must  involve
    family life she submitted.  Although the child had now  been  born  the
    appellant wished to visit his child in the United Kingdom.   There  was
    no material error of law.

10.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision if it was flawed  in
    law.  Further I note that the judge had the  benefit  of  hearing  oral
    evidence from the appellant's wife.

11.   The  judge's  approach  was  balanced.   He  noted  and  accepted  the
    Presenting Officer's submission about the  fact  that  the  appellant's
    credibility had been dented by his previous immigration history but set
    this factor against other positive factors which he highlighted in  the
    concluding paragraphs of his determination.  As I have said,  I  accept
    Counsel's point about the typographical mistake in paragraph 18.

12.  The point is, as Mr Avery submitted a narrow one.

13.  The first  matter  to  note  is  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision and the review by the Entry Clearance Manager on 24 June  2015
    were taken against the background that the application was  subject  to
    mandatory refusal.  In considering the appellant's claim under  Article
    8 the Entry Clearance Manager had acted properly in the exercise  of  a
    fair and firm immigration policy and that the decision to refuse  entry
    clearance in this case was "in proportion to maintaining the  integrity
    of the immigration control".  It does appear that the decisions of  the
    Entry Clearance Manager and Entry Clearance Officer were taken  against
    the background of matters which were subsequently conceded.

14.  The point at issue in  this  case  is  encapsulated  in  the  following
    extract from the Entry Clearance Manager's decision:

         "The decision to refuse the appellant entry to visit the UK to  see
         his sponsor will not prevent them being able  to  continue  to  see
         each other or to reside with each other in a third country.   I  am
         therefore satisfied that this decision is correct  in  law  and  in
         proportion to the maintaining of an effective immigration control."



15.  The Entry Clearance Officer had regard  to  the  Section  55  duty  and
    considered:

         "The statutory duty in Section 55 does not  apply  in  relation  to
         children who are outside the United Kingdom.  However, in reviewing
         this case I have adhered to the spirit of the duty.   In  reviewing
         the case, I have noted  that  the  sponsor  had  resided  with  the
         appellant in Vietnam and chose to return to  the  UK  to  have  the
         child.  Since the child is already in the UK then the  requirements
         of Section 55 do not apply in this case."

16.  In conclusion the Entry Clearance Officer stated  that  "given  all  of
    the above" he did not consider  that  the  appellant  "has  tipped  the
    evidential balance in his favour, and I maintain the decision to refuse
    entry clearance."

17.  Of  course  it  was  for  the  First-tier  Judge  to  re-weigh  matters
    particularly in the light of the concessions made at  the  hearing  and
    the findings of fact that he made.

18.  The judge found that family life was being  maintained  by  the  visits
    being made by both parties.  Both parties have their own occupations in
    the United Kingdom and Vietnam respectively.  There  is  no  indication
    that the judge did not accept the appellant's wife's evidence about the
    difficulties of her travelling to  Vietnam  with  a  baby.   The  judge
    accepted the evidence about the appellant's employment.

19.  The judge weighed up the matters for  and  against  the  appellant  and
    came to an adequately reasoned conclusion.

20.  It is important to note that the appellant  is  married  to  a  British
    citizen and the couple have a  British  citizen  child.   Further  that
    there was a genuine and subsisting family  life  between  the  parties.
    The facts of the case  are  somewhat  unusual.   It  is  possible  that
    another First-tier Judge might have  reached  a  different  conclusion.
    However I am unable to say  that  this  judge  misdirected  himself  or
    failed to set out an adequate basis for his decision.

21.  I raised at the hearing the question of what the effect of the  judge's
    decision was.  Mr Avery suggested that a fresh application for a  visit
    visa should be made.  I would accept that the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    needs to be approached by way of an application based on  the  decision
    made by the First-tier Judge when it is convenient for him to  come  to
    this country to see his wife and child.  There is no suggestion that he
    wishes to do more than visit his family in this country.  While it is a
    matter for the parties I would be inclined to agree that the  appellant
    would need to make a visit application since that  would  be  the  most
    appropriate application for him.  There would appear to  be  no  reason
    why that application should not succeed in the  circumstances  but  the
    mechanics of the matter are best left to the parties to resolve.

Decision

22.  For the reasons I have given the appeal of the Entry Clearance  Officer
    is dismissed and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  confirmed.



Anonymity Direction

23.  The First-tier Judge made no anonymity direction and I make none.

Fee Award

24.  The First-tier Judge made no fee award and I make none.
