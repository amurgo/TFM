                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Shimmin
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 3rd January 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 2nd  August  1990.   She
    applied to come to the UK to join her husband on 30th August  2013  but
    was refused on 12th December 2013 on the grounds  that  she  could  not
    meet the maintenance requirements of the Rules.

 3. The Sponsor produced a P60 for the tax year to 5th April  2012  showing
    that from his employment with Zara Food Limited, which  he  started  on
    1st April 2011, he earned �12,740 for the full year.  It was said  that
    by the time he made his application his income had increased to �18,516
    per annum.  The judge recorded that the specific documentation required
    by the Immigration Rules had not been provided and there was  no  basis
    for challenging  the  conclusions  in  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    refusal of entry clearance since on the  Appellant's  own  evidence  he
    fell short of the required level of income set down in the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. He also considered Article 8 and  concluded  that  whilst  family  life
    existed, since the financial requirements of the  Rules  could  not  be
    met, the refusal of entry clearance was proportionate.

 5. The Appellant appealed on the grounds that the  Sponsor  believed  that
    the hearing was to take place on 10th January 2014 but it took place in
    his absence on 3rd January 2014.  He enclosed a P60 which verified  his
    annual income as �18,917 and he was therefore in a position to meet the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules. Permission was duly granted.

The Hearing

 6. The Sponsor accepted that it had been his mistake so far as the date of
    the hearing was concerned and he had simply got it wrong.   So  far  as
    his income was concerned he was very vague about  what  he  had  earned
    then but maintained  that  he  was  now  in  a  position  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules although he accepted that as at the  date  of
    decision his income was too low. He then said that  there  had  been  a
    genuine miscalculation of his income which was in fact �18,912 and well
    above the level required by the Rules.  He provided a P60 for the  year
    to 5th April 2013 in confirmation, and a number of  payslips  including
    the payslips for the six months leading up to the date of  application.



Findings and Conclusions

 7. This decision can only be set aside if it can be shown that  the  judge
    made a legal error in his decision.  Two errors are argued here.

 8. The first is that the judge proceeded in the absence  of  the  Sponsor.
    However the Sponsor admitted that he had made a mistake, and  certainly
    there is no evidence in  the  file  that  the  hearing  date  was  ever
    anything other than 3rd January 2014.  The judge was  plainly  entitled
    to proceed in the Sponsor's absence.

 9. Second, it is said that the Appellant can in fact meet the requirements
    of the Rules.

10. However the payslips which have been produced for the six months before
    the application was made, i.e. August 2012 do not show that  he  earned
    the requisite income at that time.  Moreover  it  is  entirely  unclear
    whether these payslips were ever shown to the Entry Clearance  Officer.



11. The only P60 which was before the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  that
    relating to the tax year to 5th April  2012  when  the  Sponsor  earned
    �12,740.  It was entirely open to the judge to state that  he  regarded
    the claim that the Sponsor's wages had increased  substantially,  by  a
    third, between April and August with some caution.  But in  any  event,
    on the evidence before him, the level of �18,600 was not met.

12. The Sponsor now produces a P60 for the tax year to 5th April 2013 which
    purports to show that he earned �18,917 in  that  employment  but  that
    evidence was not before the judge.  Neither were the payslips which  he
    produced in court today.

13. If a re-application is made  the  Sponsor  must  check  carefully  what
    evidence is required and ensure  that  it  is  all  produced  with  the
    application.  Mention was made at the hearing that the  couple  have  a
    child although no evidence has been produced and no  reference  to  any
    children was made in the Grounds of Appeal before the judge.  If  there
    is a child of course the income  requirements  are  increased  to  over
    �22,000 and it has never been the Sponsor's case  that  he  earns  that
    sum.

14. So far as Article 8 is concerned, again there is no error in the  judge
    concluding that the refusal is proportionate bearing in mind that as at
    the date of decision the Sponsor and Appellant were not in  a  position
    to meet the financial requirements of the Rules.

Decision

15. The judge did not err in law and his decision stands.
