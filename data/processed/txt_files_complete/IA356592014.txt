For the appellant:     Mr Gill, of Gill Law Chambers
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Muhammad Shafique, date of birth 1.9.98, is a citizen of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Herwald promulgated 7.1.15, dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  27.8.14,  to  refuse  his
    application made on 15.7.14 for leave to remain in the UK as  a  spouse
    of a person present and settled in the UK, pursuant to Appendix  FM  of
    the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 22.12.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Shimmin  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    23.2.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.4.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Herwald should be set aside.

 6. At �11 of the decision the judge accepted that pursuant to  section  84
    of the 2202 Act the Tribunal could consider evidence about  any  matter
    relevant to  the  decision,  including  evidence  concerning  a  matter
    arising after the date of decision. However, at �18(d) the judge  noted
    that the requirement to produce an  acceptable  English  language  test
    certificate is 'specified evidence' which must be provided at the  time
    of the application.

 7. The grounds of permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  argue  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in law in failing  to  admit  post-
    decision evidence, namely a recently  obtained  English  language  test
    certificate, obtained after the date of decision.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Shimmin found it  was  arguable
    that because this was not a Points Based System application, the  judge
    should not have excluded the evidence.

 9.  However,  whilst  section  85(4)  permits  the  Tribunal  to  consider
    "evidence about any matter which it thinks relevant to the substance of
    the decision, including evidence which concerns a matter arising  after
    the date of decision," that does not mean that the Tribunal is able  to
    consider circumstances appertaining after the date of decision. Section
    E-LTRP 4.1  of  Appendix  FM  requires  the  appellant  to  provide  an
    acceptable English language test  certificate.  This  is  described  as
    specified evidence. Appendix FM-SE D provides  that  the  Secretary  of
    State  will  only  consider  specified  documents  submitted  with  the
    application and will not consider such documents  submitted  after  the
    application unless one of the (evidential flexibility)  provisions  set
    out under D are met. It has not been submitted that the late production
    of the English language certificate should have been admitted under any
    of these evidential flexibility provisions.  It  was  produced  at  the
    appeal hearing, having been served on the Secretary of State only a few
    days earlier and thus there had been no time to consider  the  validity
    of the certificate, though it appears to have been accepted  that  this
    new certificate met the requirements for such certificates.

10. Thus section  85(4)  could  only  assist  the  appellant  if  he  could
    demonstrate by post-decision evidence that at the date  of  application
    he met the requirements. The evidence in question, the English language
    certificate, does not fulfil that role.

11. I note that the grounds of application for permission to appeal did not
    seek to challenge the  apparent  failure  of  the  judge  to  expressly
    consider whether the appellant met the alternative  requirements  under
    section  R-LTRP1.1(d),  where  EX1  applies.  In  such   circumstances,
    compliance with either the English language or  financial  requirements
    is not required; the appellant only has  to  show  compliance  with  E-
    LTRP1.2-1.12 & E-LTRP2.1.

12. Neither does the grounds challenge the judge's findings in relation  to
    article 8 ECHR set out between �20 and �23 of the decision.

13. In any event, even if there was an error of law in not considering  the
    EX1 alternative route, the Secretary of State has given cogent  reasons
    for  finding  that  the  appellant  could  not   meet   the   test   of
    insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  with  his  partner
    outside  the  UK  under  EX1(b),  as  defined  by  EX2,  namely,   very
    significant difficulties which could not be overcome  or  would  entail
    very serious hardship for the appellant or his partner. Nothing in  the
    evidence before me suggests that the appellant would be  able  to  meet
    that high threshold.

14. Neither would I have found, if  I  had  conducted  an  article  8  ECHR
    assessment outside the Rules, that the decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State was disproportionate. In addition to those factors considered  by
    Judge Herwald, including section 117B of the 2002 Act, I would add that
    if the appellant  considers  that  he  can  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM, it is open to him to make a fresh application, taking care
    to  ensure  that  he  has  all  the  necessary  evidence  to  meet  the
    requirements. For  that  reason  it  cannot  sensibly  be  said  to  be
    disproportionate to require the appellant to  comply  with  the  Rules.
    Article 8 is not a shortcut to compliance with the Rules and to  merely
    allow the appeal because he can effectively show  that  he  would  have
    been able to meet the Rules if only he had obtained  and  submitted  an
    English language test certificate  prior  to  making  the  application,
    would be to apply a near miss approach to compliance  with  the  Rules,
    which is not a principle of law open to the Tribunal.

15. In the circumstances, the appeal to the Upper Tribunal must fail.



Conclusion & Decision:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.







                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
