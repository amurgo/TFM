Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr McIndoe, instructed by Latitude Law
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Abdoul Rahman Jallow, date of birth 16.6.97, and Aisatu
    Jalloh, are citizens of Guinea.

 2. These are their linked appeal against the determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Lever, who dismissed their appeals against the decisions
    of the respondent, dated 30.9.12, to refuse their  applications,  dated
    18.6.12, for entry clearance  to  the  United  Kingdom  to  join  their
    parents, made pursuant to paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 24.9.13.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    13.11.13.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 9.1.13 as linked appeals in the Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Lever should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeals can be  summarised  as  follows.
    The father was granted humanitarian protection in the UK  in  2005.  In
    2012 his wife obtained leave to enter the UK and they came to the UK in
    March 2012, leaving their children behind. These applications  for  the
    children to join their parents were made in June 2012.

 7. The respondent refused the application of  the  second  appellant,  the
    daughter, pursuant  to  paragraph  320(7A),  because  she  submitted  a
    passport in which the birth date had been altered, as  confirmed  in  a
    document verification report. The application of the  first  appellant,
    the son, was refused because of inconsistencies in the documents as  to
    his date of birth, leading the Entry Clearance  Officer  to  doubt  the
    accuracy of the birth certificate and thus was not  satisfied  that  he
    and the sponsors were related as claimed.

 8. Judge Lever  considered  that  the  core  issue  was  not  whether  the
    appellants were related as claimed but rather whether they  were  under
    the age of 18 as claimed at the date of the application. He found  that
    in respect of both appellants documents as to birth had  been  produced
    that are not genuine. There was no error in the  mandatory  refusal  of
    the second  appellant  under  paragraph  320(7A).  The  judge  was  not
    satisfied that either appellant was under the age of 18 at the date  of
    application and thus both applications failed under  paragraph  297  of
    the Immigration Rules.

 9. The judge went  on  to  consider  article  8  ECHR,  from  �28  of  the
    determination. He found no reliable evidence that  the  appellants  are
    the children of or dependent on the sponsor and his wife, and are adult
    siblings in respect of which the evidence  is  that  they  are  leading
    their own lives in Guinea and their mother was content  to  leave  them
    behind in those circumstances and come to the UK. The judge found  that
    the refusal decisions were not disproportionate and  the  appeals  were
    thus also dismissed under article 8.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Macdonald noted the grounds  of
    appeal included the assertion that the judge was wrong at  �15  to  say
    that the burden lay on the appellants when the allegation  was  one  of
    forgery. Further, the  judge  had  failed  entirely  to  reference  the
    appellant expert report of Ticky Monekosso, failed to have regard to an
    earlier Tribunal finding that  the  father  was  a  witness  of  truth.
    "Whilst the judge's reasoning is detailed and clear,  the  grounds  are
    correct to say he did  not  refer  to  the  expert  opinion  which  was
    supportive of the appellants and contained in the bundle  presented  to
    the judge. Not to consider an assess material evidence is  an  arguable
    error in law and permission to appeal is therefore granted."

11. In suggesting that the burden lay on the appellants at �15,  the  judge
    was not referring to the burden of proof in relation to forgery but  in
    relation to the applications under paragraph  297  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. To suggest otherwise would be disingenuous.

12. In Tanveer Ahmed [2002] UKAIT  00439  STARRED,  the  Tribunal  provided
    guidance on how to approach the issue of documents where reliability is
    challenged. It was held that,

           1. "In asylum and human rights cases it  is  for  an  individual
              claimant to show that a document on which he  seeks  to  rely
              can be relied on..."


           2. A document should not be viewed in  isolation.  The  decision
              maker should look at the evidence as a whole or in the  round
              (which is the same thing....)."


           3. "Only  very  rarely  will  there  be  the  need  to  make  an
              allegation of forgery, or evidence strong enough  to  support
              it. Delegation should not  be  made  without  such  evidence.
              Failure  to  establish  the  allegation  on  the  balance  of
              probabilities to their higher civil standard  does  not  show
              that a document is reliable. The decision-makers  still  need
              to apply principles 1 and 2."


13. It is often suggested in cases  of  forgery  that  the  burden  on  the
    respondent is a high one.  In fact, as the House of Lords held in Re  B
    (Children) [2008] UKHL 35, "there is only one civil standard  of  proof
    and that is proof that the fact in issue more  probably  occurred  than
    not". However, as Ouseley J said in R (on the application of Beckett) v
    SSHD 2008 EWHC 2002 Admin, cogent evidence is  required  to  satisfy  a
    civil tribunal that someone had been  fraudulent  or  behaved  in  some
    other reprehensible manner.  The "high probability" standard of  proof,
    as Ouseley J termed it, was addressed to the cogency  of  the  evidence
    required to prove an allegation of this type rather than to a shift  in
    the standard of proof itself.

14. The evidence that  the  passport  of  the  second  appellant  had  been
    tampered with by altering the date of birth, a crucial feature  of  her
    application and appeal, was  contained  in  the  document  verification
    report of an expert. It is beyond dispute that sufficient evidence  was
    adduced that the document had been altered and Mr McIndoe accepted that
    he could get round that. In the circumstances, I find no error  of  law
    in this regard.

15. In relation to the expert report of Ticky Monekosso, it is  correct  to
    point out that there was no direct reference to it within Judge Lever's
    determination. Not to consider and assess material evidence would be an
    error of law. However, before concluding that it was a  material  error
    of law one has to look at the whole picture of evidence.

16. First, whatever the evidence of Ticky Monekosso, the application of the
    second appellant would have failed because of  paragraph  320(7A).  The
    document verification report, not  now  challenged  by  the  appellant,
    would clearly outweigh the expert report.

17. The reason for the first appellant's refusal  was  that  the  submitted
    birth certificate named the parents  as  Batulle  Jalloah  and  Ibrahim
    Jalloh, but the father stated that up  until  his  change  of  name  on
    12.8.11 he was known as Tamba Brima Jalloh, as evidenced by  change  of
    name documents. The birth was allegedly registered on  7.7.97  but  the
    certificate  was  produced  on  16.11.10.  The  father's  name   should
    therefore have been shown on  the  birth  certificate  as  Tamba  Brima
    Jalloh. At �22 the judge explained that the certificate referred  to  a
    sheet number and report book from the specific year of the alleged date
    of birth. If it were a genuine extract from  the  original  record,  it
    would not have contained the name of the father only adopted  in  2011.
    This discrepancy applies to the birth certificates of both appellants.

18. The judge considered the sponsor's explanation but  concluded  that  if
    money had been paid to an intermediary with access to the  records  and
    obtained the documents based on the information supplied by the sponsor
    and in error assumed that the  correct  name  of  the  father  was  the
    sponsor  name  as  it  is  now.  The  judge  concluded  that  in  these
    circumstances,  the  contents  of  the  birth  certificates,  "have  no
    evidential weight and are simply documents produced by an  intermediary
    for a fee based on information provided  by  the  sponsor  and  do  not
    reflect a genuine extract from  a  government  document  even  if  such
    documents ever existed in the first place."

19. It is difficult to see in the light of such a conclusion how an  expert
    report addressing the general difficulties with official  documents  in
    Guinea could have any bearing on the finding that no evidential  weight
    can be placed on the documents. Even if taken into account, the factual
    evidence, including the  sponsor's  explanation,  fully  justified  the
    conclusion reached to accord no weight to the birth certificates.

20. In any event, at �24 the  judge  highlighted  further  difficulties  in
    relation to  the  submitted  documents.  The  passport  of  the  second
    appellant stated that she was born in Conakry, which is consistent with
    the birth certificates,  but  the  sponsor's  evidence  was  that  both
    children were born in Liberia. As the judge stated, "It  further  means
    that both birth certificates said to be extracts from  the  records  of
    the town of Conakry in 1995  and  1997  are  in  themselves  forgeries,
    leaving aside the obvious error of the sponsor's forename." The  expert
    report could not provide  any  satisfactory  account  for  this  rather
    serious inconsistency.

21. At �20 the judge found that the sponsors would have  been  unlikely  to
    leave the children in Guinea in what would or  may  be  regarded  as  a
    precarious position if under 18 and being looked after by no one closer
    than a neighbour. That is a finding that does not relate  to  documents
    at all, but is relied on in relation to conclusions in relation to  age
    at �26.

22. The judge's findings in relation to the documents stand independent  of
    general difficulties  with  documents  as  highlighted  in  the  expert
    report. The report does not and could  not  change  those  conclusions,
    which are either independently verified by an expert document examiner,
    or specifically based on the evidence and explanations provided by  the
    appellants. In the circumstances, whilst no reference was made  to  the
    expert report within the determination, I fail to see that there  could
    have been any different conclusion in  relation  to  the  documents  in
    question.

23. Finally, the  ground  of  complaint  as  to  the  previous  finding  of
    credibility of the sponsoring  father  is  largely  irrelevant  to  the
    issues at the heart of this appeal. It  can  have  no  bearing  on  the
    presentation of what the  judge  concluded  were  forged  or  otherwise
    unreliable documents. At best the earlier determination could have been
    no more than  a  starting  point  which  undoubtedly  would  have  been
    entirely undermined by the submission of false documents in support  of
    the ages of the appellants. If there  was  an  error  of  law  in  this
    regard, I find on the circumstances of this case  that  it  could  have
    made no different to the outcome of the appeals.

Conclusion & Decision

24. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: I find no error of law and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
stands.
