Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Robinson, instructed by Juris Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless for the purposes of this decision I  shall  refer
    to the parties as they were described before the  First-Tier  Tribunal,
    that is Mr Mohammad as the appellant and the Secretary of State as  the
    respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of India, born  on  5th  June  1987  and  he
    appeals against the decision of the respondent dated 2nd  October  2013
    to refuse his application for leave to  remain  as  the  partner  of  a
    British citizen under Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE.

 3. In that decision the Secretary of State  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant could meet EX.1.

 4. The appellant had entered the UK as a Tier 4 Student  on  22nd  January
    2009 and completed a Masters Degree.  He  married  Nadine  Williams  on
    19th September 2012 and he made an application for leave to  remain  on
    25th October 2012.  The appellant had conceded that he did not meet the
    current income threshold of �18,600 but  he  was  working  and  earning
    between �1,000 and �1,200 a month and they paid rent of �240 a month.

 5. The appeal against the respondent's refusal  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Woolley on 13th May 2014 and in a  decision  promulgated
    on 19th May 2014 the judge allowed the appeal.

 6. An application for permission to appeal was  made  by  the  respondent.
    The judge accepted at paragraph 22 that the appellant  could  not  meet
    the requirements of Appendix FM but  he  found  there  were  compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules as per  Nagre
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC  720  (Admin).
    It was asserted that the judge considered the appellant's unborn  child
    and placed excessive weight on this in the determination on Article  8.
    The judge found, on the  basis  of  the  unborn  child,  that  Ogundimu
    (Article 8 - new Rules) Nigeria [2013] applied and that the appellant's
    partner could not be expected to relocate to India.  As such the  judge
    had erred in law.

 7. At paragraph 29 the judge had noted the  reasonable  foreseeability  of
    the birth of the child who would be a British citizen but the judge did
    not acknowledge that even though there must be some consideration given
    to the unborn child, the child is not regarded in  law  as  a  separate
    entity from the mother.

 8. It was argued further to Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
    approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC)  an appeal  should  only  be  allowed
    where there are exceptional circumstances.

 9. The Secretary of State had applied the immigration law and there was no
    prejudice to the appellant in this approach.  The appellant and sponsor
    could continue their family life together in India.  Whilst the  unborn
    child merited some consideration, having found that in law  the  unborn
    child was not regarded as a separate  entity,  that  consideration  and
    impact on the overall balancing exercise had to be limited.

10. There was no analysis by the judge as to why the  appellant  could  not
    submit  a  further  application  or  any  reasoning  why  it  would  be
    unjustifiably harsh to require him  to  do  so.   There  is  a  minimum
    entitlement threshold with the aim of  ensuring  those  who  choose  to
    establish their family life in the UK should have the financial ability
    to support themselves.  The judge failed to consider and make  findings
    on this issue.

The Hearing

11. At the hearing Mr Richards submitted that there was a very narrow point
    on a single issue and in effect the judge had  essentially  found  that
    the appellant's appeal under the Rules could not succeed but  had  gone
    on to consider the matter on the basis of the appellant's partner being
    pregnant.  The judge should have assessed family life as  it  stood  at
    the date of the hearing and it was not open to the judge to  take  into
    account an unborn child.

12. Ms Robinson submitted her skeleton argument and relied  essentially  on
    that.  She submitted there were compelling circumstances aside from the
    existence of the child and the removal would  have  forced  a  pregnant
    woman to continue her  pregnancy  either  without  her  husband  or  to
    relocate in a country where she would have very little support.  It was
    reasonable for the judge to consider this.

13. At paragraph 5 it was recorded that the  Secretary  of  State  conceded
    that an unborn child may be considered a  compelling  circumstance  not
    recognised by the Rules. Although Ogundimu (Article 8)  was  considered
    it was not the deciding factor and indeed at paragraph 29 Judge Woolley
    stated "the reasonable foreseeability of the birth  of  the  child  who
    will be a British citizen must necessitate some  consideration  in  the
    overall balancing exercise".  The  judge  explicitly  stated  that  the
    child was not to be regarded as a separate entity and  therefore  could
    not have said to have fallen into error.

14. With regards to the failure to consider MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ
    985 and the weight to the respondent's concerns,  Judge Woolley clearly
    took into account the need to maintain effective immigration control at
    paragraph 28 in the event that his decision was found to be in error
    the respondent argued he cannot now be forced to leave the UK in the
    light of Zambrano [2011] EUECJ  C-34/09.  His child is a British
    citizen and should not be deprived of the rights by being forced to
    live without her father.

15. Ms Robinson submitted it was disproportionate to expect  the  child  to
    live without her father.

16. Mr Richards submitted that the balancing exercise was such  that  there
    must be full account taken of the economic wellbeing  of  the  country.
    He did accept that with regards  to  the  Immigration  Rules  that  the
    appellant could fulfil all of  the  other  Immigration  Rules  and  the
    question was whether EX.1 was fulfilled.  It was accepted there was now
    a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a  British  citizen
    child and the question was whether it would be reasonable for the child
    to leave the UK.

17. I am not persuaded that the judge erred in allowing the appeal  outside
    the Rules.  He was clear that there were compelling  circumstances  not
    sufficiently recognised under the Rules, that is that  the  mother  was
    pregnant with a child due in the very short  timeframe  and  I  do  not
    accept that the judge erred  in  failing  to  follow  the  guidance  in
    Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules -  correct  approach)  [2013]  UKUT  640
    (IAC). Although the Immigration Rules  set  out  the  position  of  the
    Secretary of State, with regards to the appellant's human rights  claim
    under Article 8, and to which  the  Judge  gave  weight,  they  do  not
    necessarily  displace  the  need  for   assessment   under   Strasbourg
    jurisprudence, MM Lebanon [2014] EWCA Civ 985, Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA
    Civ 74.

18. R (Nagre) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC  720
    (Admin)  has been cited and specifically at paragraph 29 to the  effect
    that

         "... the new Rules do  provide  better  explicit  coverage  of  the
         factors identified in case law as relevant to  analysis  of  claims
         under Article 8 than was formerly the position, so  in  many  cases
         the main points for consideration in relation to Article 8 would be
         addressed by decision makers applying the new Rules.   It  is  only
         after doing that there remains an arguable case that there  may  be
         good grounds for granting leave to  remain  outside  the  Rules  by
         reference to Article 8 that it will  be  necessary  for  Article  8
         purposes to  go  on  and  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the  new  Rules  to
         require the grant of such leave."

19. This case law has been reviewed in a number of authorities  and  it  is
    right to say that MF (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192,)  confirms  that   the   test   of
    exceptionality is no longer to  be  applied.   Singh  at  paragraph  64
    states as follows:

         "In my view that is a mis-reading of Aikens  LJ's  observation.  He
         was not questioning the substantial point made by Sales J.  He  was
         simply saying that it was unnecessary for  the  decision-maker,  in
         approaching the "second stage", to have to decide first whether  it
         was arguable that there was a good  article  8  claim  outside  the
         Rules - that being what he calls  "the  intermediary  test"  -  and
         then, if he decided that it was arguable, to go on to  assess  that
         claim: he should simply decide  whether  there  was  a  good  claim
         outside the Rules or not. I am not sure that I  would  myself  have
         read  Sales  J  as  intending  to  impose  any  such   intermediary
         requirement, though I agree with  Aikens  LJ  that  if  he  was  it
         represents an unnecessary refinement.  But  what  matters  is  that
         there is nothing in Aikens LJ's comment which casts doubt on  Sales
         J's basic point that there is no need to conduct  a  full  separate
         examination  of  article  8  outside  the  Rules  where,   in   the
         circumstances of a  particular  case,  all  the  issues  have  been
         addressed in the consideration under the Rules."

20. Oludoyi v SSHD (Article 8 - MM (Lebanon) and Nagre) IJR [2014] UKUT 539
    (IAC) confirms that there is nothing in Nagre, Gulshan or Shahzad  that
    suggests a threshold test was being suggested as making it  clear  that
    there was a need to look at the evidence to see if there  was  anything
    that had not already been adequately considered in the context  of  the
    Immigration Rules and which could lead to a successful Article 8 claim.
     This is consistent with RMM and Others v SSHD [2014] EWCA.   There  is
    no prior threshold which dictates the exercise of discretion should  be
    considered.

21. Indeed the judge referred to R (Razgar) v SSHD  [2004]  UKHL  27  which
    sets out the five stage test to be adopted in this instance and Huang v
    SSHD  [2007]  UKHL  specifically  rejected  the  test  of   exceptional
    circumstances and confirmed at 20

         "... the ultimate question for the appellate immigration  authority
         is whether the refusal of leave to enter or remain in circumstances
         where the life of the family cannot reasonably be  expected  to  be
         enjoyed  elsewhere  taking  full  account  of  all   considerations
         weighing in favour of the refusal prejudices the family life of the
         applicant to a manner sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of
         the fundamental right protected by Article 8".

22. As such I reject this challenge to the decision by Judge Woolley.  Even
    if that were not the case he has indeed set out why he considered there
    to be compelling reasons and he identified  that  the  removal  of  the
    appellant would either mean forcing a pregnant  woman,  and  a  British
    citizen, to continue her pregnancy without  her  husband  or  that  she
    should relocate to a country where she would have very little  support.
    As Ms Robinson pointed out  at  paragraph  5  of  the  application  for
    permission to appeal the respondent conceded that an unborn  child  may
    be considered a compelling circumstance not sufficiently recognised  by
    the Rules.

23. That said, unfortunately the judge set out the  ruling  in  Sanade  and
    Others (British children - Zambrano -  Dereci)  India  [2012]  UKUT  48
    which has been qualified by Ogundimu (Article 8 -  new  Rules)  Nigeria
    [2013] UKUT 60 to the  effect  that  this  principle  only  extends  to
    British citizen spouse or partner where there is in addition a  British
    child.  At this point the judge engaged the "reasonable  foreseeability
    of the birth of a child who will be a British citizen" which  he  found
    "must necessitate some consideration in the overall balancing exercise,
    even though the unborn child is not  regarded  in  law  as  a  separate
    entity from the mother".

24. I find it difficult to accept that the  judge  having  found  that  the
    child is not regarded in law as a separate entity from the mother  that
    the judge was in effect able to factor in a real time consideration  of
    a break-up by the "mother and children remaining  in  the  UK  and  the
    father returning to India by himself" at a stage when the child was not
    born.

25. I therefore find an error of law.

26. That said the findings of fact are  essentially  preserved  insofar  as
    they relate to the circumstances of the appellant and his  sponsor  but
    there is the additional consideration on my re-making that the child is
    now born and was born in October 2014.

27. The appellant cannot  comply  with  paragraph  276ADE  as  he  has  not
    remained in  the  UK  for  20  years.   With  regards  the  significant
    obstacles it may be that he himself does not have  significant  barrier
    if he were to return alone. The issue  here  is  the  wife  and  child.
    Turning to Appendix FM, the starting  point  for  my  consideration  in
    regards the re-making of the decision is the Immigration Rules  as  per
    SS Congo v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387.   At  the  hearing  before  me  Mr
    Richards confirmed that the appellant had complied with the Immigration
    Rules (although he noted that he could not comply  with  the  financial
    requirements) and the remaining factor to be considered was  EX.1.   It
    is clear that the appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with his child who is a British citizen and  the  question
    is whether it will be reasonable for the child to leave the UK.

28. The decision of Sanade can now legitimately be engaged and it cannot be
    suggested that it would be reasonable for the child to  leave  the  UK.
    As such that would necessitate the mother remaining in the UK  to  care
    for the child.  Any decision must engage a consideration of Section  55
    of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009  and  this  would
    entail the consideration of the children's best interests as a  primary
    consideration.  I stress not the primary consideration  but  a  primary
    consideration  and  that  does  not   necessarily   trump   all   other
    considerations.

29. It was submitted that there was  a  choice  for  the  parents  to  live
    separately but clearly this would not be in the best interests  of  the
    child who needs the financial support of the father  who  is  currently
    working and it is in the best interests of the  child  to  remain  with
    both parents.

30. The appellant is not barred through the suitability requirements but it
    was considered reasonable that his partner could relocate with him.  He
    would not be able to be considered under the parent route  as  he  does
    not have sole responsibility and his wife is his partner.  I also  take
    into account Section 117B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 as reflective of the Secretary of State's position in relation  to
    proportionality.  The father can speak English is earning an income and
    supporting his family and he himself would not be a burden on  the  tax
    payer although he does not appear to have enough income to support  the
    whole family under Appendix  FM.   Those  requirements  have  been  the
    subject of extensive judicial scrutiny and been upheld  in  MM  Lebanon
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  That said the factor  of  EX.1  (which  does  not
    require the financial requirements to be met)  and reasonability of the
    child leaving the UK is one of the issues here.

31. The question is whether it is reasonable,  in  effect,  to  expect  the
    father to live separately from the mother and I note that Section 117B,
    section 6 states -

         '117B  -   (6)      In the case of a person who is not liable to
             deportation, the public         interest does not require the
             person's removal where -

                      (a)   the person has a genuine and subsisting
                           parental relationship with a qualifying child,
                           and

                      (b)   it would not be reasonable to expect the child
                           to leave the United Kingdom.'

32. The further question is whether the separation of the parents would  in
    effect force the child  to  leave  the  UK.   It  was  found  that  the
    appellant can succeed under the remaining Immigration Rules  and  I  do
    not find that it would be reasonable to expect the child to  leave  the
    UK which is what in effect is being requested should  the  family  wish
    and desire to stay together.

33. Lord Brown in EB Kosovo [2008] UKHL 41 reasoned as follows:

         "[48] Thus the appellate immigration authority must  make  its  own
         judgment and that judgment  will  be  strongly  influenced  by  the
         particular facts and circumstances  of  the  particular  case.  The
         authority will, of course, take note of factors which have, or have
         not, weighed with the  Strasbourg  court.  It  will,  for  example,
         recognise that it will rarely be proportionate to uphold  an  order
         for removal of a spouse if there is a close and genuine  bond  with
         the other spouse and that spouse cannot reasonably be  expected  to
         follow the removed spouse to the country  of  removal,  or  if  the
         effect  of  the  order  is  to  sever  a  genuine  and   subsisting
         relationship  between  parent  and  child.  But  cases   will   not
         ordinarily raise such stark choices, and there  is  in  general  no
         alternative to making a careful  and  informed  evaluation  of  the
         facts of the particular case. The search for a hard-edged or bright-
         line rule to be applied to the generality of cases is  incompatible
         with the difficult evaluative exercise which article 8 requires."

34. R (on the application of Chen)  v  SSHD  (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -
    temporary separation - proportionality) IJR  [2015]  UKUT  00189  (IAC)
    asserted that

         "Lord Brown was not laying down a legal test when he  suggested  in
         Chikwamba that requiring a claimant  to  make  an  application  for
         entry clearance would only "comparatively rarely" be  proportionate
         in a case involving children (per Burnett J, as he then was,  in  R
         (Kotecha and Das v SSHD [2011] EWHC 2070 (Admin))."

35. And the court in Chen added at [37]

         "In my judgement, if it is shown by an individual (the burden being
         upon him or her) that  an  application  for  entry  clearance  from
         abroad would  be  granted  and  that  there  would  be  significant
         interference with family life by temporary removal, the  weight  to
         be accorded to the formal requirement of obtaining entry  clearance
         is reduced.  In  cases  involving  children,  where  removal  would
         interfere with the child's enjoyment of family  life  with  one  or
         other of his or her parents whilst entry clearance is obtained,  it
         will be easier to show that the balance on proportionality falls in
         favour of the claimant than in cases which do not involve  children
         but where removal interferes with family life between  parties  who
         knowingly entered into  the  relationship  in  the  knowledge  that
         family life was being established whilst the immigration status  of
         one party was "precarious". In other words, in the former case,  it
         would be easier to show that the  individual's  circumstances  fall
         within the minority envisaged by the House of Lords in Huang or the
         exceptions referred to in judgments of the ECtHR than in the latter
         case. However, it all depends on the facts."

36. In these circumstances there is a British citizen mother with  a  newly
    born British citizen child although this is  not  necessarily  a  trump
    card it is a factor to be borne  in  mind.   Additionally,  should  the
    appellant return to Pakistan his employment will end and it is the fact
    that the mother will have to look after the child  without  an  income.
    This cannot be in the child's interests and contributes to the issue of
    whether  he  should  return  to  make  an  application   from   abroad.
    Following the birth of  her  first  child  and  the  need  for  medical
    attention I do not consider that it would  be  reasonable  for  her  to
    remove herself from the UK even for a short period. This is not a  case
    where the genuineness of the relationship is under scrutiny and I  note
    the couple have been together since 2012 and the appellant entered  the
    UK lawfully and has remained in the UK lawfully.

37. To avoid long term separation of this family the child would in fact be
    expected to leave the UK. I also take into account  the  disruption  to
    the family, that the wife does not speak a native  language  which  she
    would need to do in India, and the child would effectively be  deprived
    of its ability to be raised in the UK as a British citizen. The  family
    would lose their livelihood and in the short term medical care.

38. Taking full account of all considerations, I considered that the family
    life of the claimant and his wife and child would be  prejudiced  in  a
    manner sufficiently serious to amount to a breach  of  the  fundamental
    right protected by Article 8 Huang v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2007] UKHL 11.

39. I therefore find that the appellant has succeeded under the Immigration
    Rules themselves and I therefore re-make the  decision  and  allow  the
    appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.

Notice of Decision

The Judge erred materially for the reasons  identified.   I  set  aside  the
decision  pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals   Courts   and
Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the decision under section  12(2)
(b) (ii) of the TCE 2007.

The appeal is allowed on Human Rights grounds.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
because at the time of the decision the child was not born and  issues  have
become more complex that at the date of the application.


Signed      Date 24th August 2015

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington
