                                DETERMINATION


1.   During the currency of his leave to enter the United Kingdom as a  Tier
    4 (General) Migrant, Mr Chowdhury married a British  citizen,  Jahanara
    Begum Uddin, on 4th January 2012, and  applied  for  variation  of  his
    leave on 21st March 2012.  Before this application was determined,  Mrs
    Jahanara wrote to the Border Agency on 10th July 2012, to say that  she
    had gone back to live  with  her  mother  and  that  she  regarded  the
    marriage as at an end.  Since E-LTRP 1.7 of Appendix FM  requires  that
    "the relationship between the  applicant  and  their  partner  must  be
    genuine and subsisting", the application to vary leave clearly fell  to
    be refused under the Immigration Rules, and it was indeed  refused,  on
    private as well as family life grounds, on 27th November 2012.   Notice
    of appeal was faxed to the First-tier Tribunal by Universal  Solicitors
    on 12th December, with lengthy grounds based on the  rather  surprising
    assertion that  the  appellant  and  sponsor  were  intending  to  live
    together permanently.

2.    The appeal was listed for hearing on 19th February 2013,  but  Kingdom
    Solicitors, to whom Mr  Chowdhury  had  transferred  his  instructions,
    submitted Further Grounds of Appeal based on  the  fact  that  Jahanara
    Begum had given birth to their client's son on 15th December 2012,  and
    that an application for  a  Contact  Order  was  to  be  heard  by  the
    Aldershot and Farnham  County  Court  on  13th  March.   This,  it  was
    contended, meant that Mr Chowdhury qualified either for  limited  leave
    as a parent under Appendix FM, or for leave under EX.1(a).

3.   The case was accordingly put back to 9th April,  while  on  13th  March
    District Judge King made an order in the County Court for two  sessions
    of 'observed supervised contact' of one hour each, to  be  followed  by
    'supported contact' for one hour every fortnight, for  at  least  eight
    sessions, at the Camberley Contact Centre.  When the appeal came before
    Judge Hanes at Taylor House on 9th April, she adjourned the proceedings
    (according to her handwritten note) in  order  for  the  respondent  to
    consider whether the decision under  appeal  should  be  withdrawn  and
    whether the appellant could then make a fresh  application  (presumably
    for leave to remain as a parent).

4.   The case was set down for  a  Case  Management  Review  Hearing  before
    Judge Blake on 6th June, when the Presenting Officer indicated that the
    decision of 27th November 2012 was to  be  maintained.   The  case  was
    accordingly set down for a full hearing on 30th August, and in  a  very
    short determination (a little over a page) Judge Andonian  allowed  the
    appeal "both under the immigration rules and  under  Article  8."   The
    judge did not specify which immigration rules he had in mind, and  that
    was one of the grounds of appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  second
    ground was that, in allowing the appeal under  Article  8  outside  the
    Rules, the judge had not  identified  any  'exceptional  circumstances'
    which, it was said, had to be present  in  order  to  justify  such  an
    outcome.  The third ground was that Mr Chowdhury should  have  made  "a
    separate application under the Immigration  Rules."   Which  rule  this
    should have been is not specified, but  presumably  it  is  R-LTRPT  of
    Appendix FM, this rule having been suggested in  the  first  ground  as
    being the most likely candidate  for  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
    Rules.

5.   Permission was granted by Judge Cruthers,  and  when  the  matter  came
    before me Miss Holmes thought that R-LTRP must have been meant  in  her
    colleague's grounds of appeal,  rather  than  R-LTRPT,  i.e.  leave  to
    remain as  a  partner  rather  than  as  a  parent.   But  the  marital
    relationship having completely broken down,  what  Judge  Andonian  was
    focusing on was the relationship between  the  British  child  and  his
    father.  It was clear, however, that the judge had  totally  failed  to
    check whether Mr  Chowdhury  really  did  succeed  under  the  relevant
    immigration rule.  R-LTRPT is  indeed  the  relevant  rule,  but  Judge
    Andonian made no mention of it, and did not  run  through  any  of  its
    requirements to see whether  they  were  satisfied  by  the  appellant.
    Accordingly, the judge had no basis for allowing his appeal  under  the
    Rules.

6.   As to whether Judge Andonian was  entitled  to  find  that  the  appeal
    succeeded under the family life aspect of Article 8, it seems that,  in
    assessing the strength of the family life tie between father  and  son,
    he misunderstood the amount of contact which Mr  Chowdhury  was  having
    with Mohammed Uddin.  He says that Jahanara Begum had "made  the  child
    available for contact for two sessions of observed  supervised  contact
    for one hour once a week at a contact centre."  This  ostensibly  means
    ongoing contact on a weekly basis.  This  interpretation  is  confirmed
    when the judge writes, a little further on, that "the child  is  seeing
    the father on a supervised basis at the centre."  But that was not  so.
    There had been two one-hour sessions in total of  'observed  supervised
    contact'.  The first took place on 25th June, the second on 16th  July.
    There was no evidence before Judge Andonian that the eight  fortnightly
    sessions of 'supported contact' at Camberley Contact Centre, ordered by
    District Judge King, had commenced by the date of the hearing  on  30th
    August.  It was premature for the First-tier Tribunal to  suppose  that
    continuing regular contact between Mr Chowdhury and Mohammed  would  be
    authorized, such as to  permit  family  life  between  the  two  to  be
    developed in the United Kingdom.

7.   I  found  therefore  that  the  Article  8  aspect  of  the  First-tier
    determination was infected by material  error,  and  that  the  judge's
    decision on it had to be set aside, along with his decision  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  On the other hand,  the  respondent's  decision  to
    remove Mr Chowdhury under section 47 of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006 was unlawful at the time when  it  was  made,  and
    Miss Holmes helpfully withdrew it.  The decision on the appeal  against
    the refusal to vary the appellant's leave would now have to be  re-made
    by the Upper Tribunal, and for  that  purpose  the  matter  was  listed
    before me again on 2nd January this year.

8.   I heard oral evidence from the appellant,  who  was  cross-examined  by
    Miss Holmes.  Fresh documentary evidence was also  available,  included
    in  an  Appellant's  Bundle  prepared  by  Kingdom  Solicitors.   In  a
    nutshell, the appellant's case is that he qualifies for leave to remain
    as a parent under Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules (with EX.1(a) as
    a fall-back  position).   I  discussed  with  the  two  representatives
    whether I had jurisdiction to determine the appeal on this basis, since
    the application made by the appellant was for  leave  to  remain  as  a
    partner, not as a parent, and section 3C of the  Immigration  Act  1971
    does not allow an application to  be  varied  once  there  has  been  a
    decision on it.  However, as Mr Chowdhury argued,  there  is  provision
    under section 86(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    for the Tribunal to  determine  "any  matter  raised  as  a  ground  of
    appeal", and  as  a  majority  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  in  AS
    (Afghanistan) [2009] EWCA Civ  1076,  the  Tribunal  may  consider  any
    grounds raised in response to a 'one-stop notice' issued under  section
    120 of the 2002 Act, even  if  those  grounds  do  not  relate  to  the
    decision under appeal.  The Notice of Refusal in the instant case  does
    include a 'One-Stop Warning',  inviting  the  appellant  to  state  any
    additional grounds which he may have  for  wishing  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom, and the view of the majority in  AS  (Afghanistan)  has
    been approved in Patel & ors [2013] UKSC 72.  Lord Carnwath  cited  the
    following passage from the IDIs of September 2006 :

             "[I]t is possible  to  vary  the  grounds  of  an  application
         already made, even by  introducing  something  completely  new.   A
         student application  can  be  varied  so  as  to  include  marriage
         grounds.  If an application is varied before a  decision  is  made,
         the applicant will be required to complete the necessary prescribed
         form to vary his application.  If an application  is  varied  post-
         decision, it would be open  to  the  applicant  to  submit  further
         grounds to be considered at appeal. ...  Once  an  application  has
         been decided it ceases to be an application, and there is no longer
         any  application  to  vary  under  section  3C(5).   So   any   new
         information will fall to be dealt with during  the  course  of  the
         appeal rather than as a variation of the original application."

9.   That there is jurisdiction to consider whether the appellant  qualifies
    for leave to remain as a parent finds confirmation also from  the  rule
    itself.  R-LTRPT 1.1(b) originally required that  "the  applicant  must
    have made a valid application for limited leave  as  a  parent."   From
    13th December 2012, by means of HC 760 the words "or  indefinite"  were
    inserted after "limited", while the words "or  partner"  were  inserted
    after "parent".  These amendments happened after the date  of  decision
    in the present case, but on an in-country appeal I am not restricted to
    the circumstances obtaining at the date of decision.  The  rule  itself
    now envisages leave to remain as a parent being granted to someone  who
    applied for leave to remain as a partner, which is what this  appellant
    did.

10.  As Mr Chowdhury did  in  his  submissions,  I  shall  run  through  the
    eligibility  requirements  of  Section  E-LTRPT,  since  the  appellant
    clearly satisfies R-LTRPT.  For E-LTRPT 2.2, the appellant's  child  is
    under 18 years of age, is living in the UK, and is a  British  citizen.
    For 2.3, the parent with whom the child normally  lives  is  a  British
    citizen and is not (any longer) the partner of the applicant.   E-LTRPT
    2.4(a)(ii) requires evidence of access rights to  the  child,  and  the
    appellant has indeed provided  evidence  that  the  eight  sessions  of
    'supported contact' ordered by District Judge King, to follow  on  from
    the 'observed supervised contact' last June and July, have been  taking
    place at the Camberley and District Family Contact Centre.  After a pre-
    contact meeting on 12th  October  last  year,  the  appellant  has  had
    sessions of 1� hours each with his son on 26th October,  9th  and  23rd
    November, and 14th  and  21st  December.   The  last  such  session  is
    scheduled for 11th January.  On 14th January there will be a Review  of
    the contact arrangements  at  Aldershot  &  Farnham  County  Court,  as
    directed by District Judge King on 13th September last,  at  which  the
    appellant will ask for more frequent  contact.   In  my  experience  of
    Family Law, this is almost certain to be granted.  Unless the appellant
    is deemed unsuitable for contact ~ and he has done nothing  to  justify
    this ~ it will be considered to be in the child's  best  interests  for
    him to have increased contact with his father.

11.  E-LTRPT 2.4(b) requires evidence that  the  appellant  is  taking,  and
    intends to continue to take, an active role in the child's  upbringing.
    Clearly, the appellant is very restricted in what he can do right  now,
    as his estranged wife will not voluntarily  allow  contact  and  he  is
    still in the  early  stages  of  the  Children  Act  regime.   But  the
    expectation  is  that  contact  will  be  gradually  widened,  so  that
    eventually the child will be allowed to spend  a  whole  day  with  his
    father, and then to stay overnight.   The  rule  itself  must  be  wide
    enough to encompass the very early as well as the final stages  of  the
    contact process.  The appellant has certainly been doing as much as  he
    can so far to play an active role in his child's  upbringing.   He  has
    been paying child maintenance, and although he got into arrears, he has
    been paying these off since last October.  He brought a present for his
    son's first birthday after, very properly, seeking the mother's consent
    to this through the Co-ordinator at the Family Contact Centre.  He  has
    diligently travelled to Camberley for every contact session.  There  is
    no reason to suppose that the appellant will stop  trying  to  play  an
    active role in his son's life if and when he gets leave to remain.  The
    leave will only be for 2� years in  any  event,  and  if  he  does  not
    continue to take an active part in his son's upbringing, the  appellant
    will not get any further leave.

12.   The  appellant  does  not  fall  foul  of  the   'immigration   status
    requirement' in E-LTRPT 3.1-3.2, and has provided evidence of  adequate
    maintenance.  He has been working for McDonalds, but only part-time, as
    is consonant with  his  statutorily  extended  leave  to  remain  as  a
    student.  He is paid fortnightly, and I have before me pay slips  dated
    27th July, 10th August, 5th October,  19th  October  and  2nd  November
    2013.  On those dates he was paid  �293,  �283,  �338,  �365  and  �293
    respectively (omitting the figures in pence).   The  current  level  of
    Income Support for a single adult is �71.70 per week.  Even taking into
    account his rent and child maintenance, the appellant  still  has  more
    than that by way of disposable weekly income.   His  rent  is  �50  per
    week, a low figure, but it appears on his Tenancy  Agreement,  and  the
    reason it is so low is, according to the appellant, that he shares  the
    flat in  Whitechapel  with  others  (including  the  landlord,  another
    gentleman of Bangladeshi origin).  Such  an  arrangement  is  perfectly
    feasible within the  Bangladeshi  community.   The  appellant  is  also
    paying Child Maintenance of �65.45 per month, although it is  currently
    more than this until the arrears are paid off in March.  We may be sure
    that these payments will not reduce his income below the Income Support
    threshold.  The Child Support Agency, which worked out how much he  had
    to pay, would not allow that.  In the future, if the appellant's  leave
    to remain as a student is replaced by leave to remain as a  parent,  he
    will be able to work full-time rather than part-time, so there is every
    likelihood of adequate maintenance in the future.

13.  E-LTRPT 4.2  requires  evidence  of  adequate  accommodation,  but  the
    evidence is no longer  'specified',  and  there  is  no  definition  of
    adequacy, save to rule out accommodation which is overcrowded or  which
    contravenes public health regulations.  The  rule  does  not  in  terms
    require an applicant to prove that his accommodation is not overcrowded
    and does not contravene public health  regulations,  and  it  would  be
    inappropriate to insist upon proof of the negative in the present case.

14.  Finally, E-LTRPT 5.1(b) requires  the  appellant  to  have  "passed  an
    English language test in speaking and listening at a minimum  of  level
    A1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages  with  a
    provider approved by the Secretary of State."   The  appellant  has  an
    Entry  Level  Certificate  in  ESOL  Skills  for  Life  (Speaking   and
    Listening), awarded in January 2012 by Trinity College,  London,  which
    is listed  at  Appendix  O  of  HC  395  as  satisfying  the  level  A1
    requirement.

15.  The upshot of  all  this  is  that  the  appellant  satisfies  all  the
    requirements of the Rules for the grant of limited leave to remain as a
    parent.  There is no need to fall back upon EX.1(a) of Appendix FM,  or
    indeed to consider Article 8 outside the Rules.




     DECISION

     There being material errors of law  in  the  First-tier  determination,
    the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is  allowed,  and
    the decision on the appeal is  re-made  by  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The
    appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.
