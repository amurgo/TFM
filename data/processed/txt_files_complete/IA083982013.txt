                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant was in court with his father, Mr Aka Faussou.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Ivory Coast, born on  27  December  1985.
    On 9 August 2012 the appellant applied for  a  residence  card  in  the
    United Kingdom as confirmation of a right to reside in the  UK  as  the
    family member of an EEA national who is exercising treaty rights in the
    UK.  His application was refused  on  1  March  2013  under  Regulation
    15(1)(b) with reference  to  Regulation  8  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  The reasons for the refusal were that the  appellant
    had not resided in the United Kingdom with his EEA family member for  a
    continuous  period  of  5  years.   Furthermore,  he  had   failed   to
    demonstrate that he was genuinely dependent upon his EEA family member.
     The appellant's sponsor is his father, Mr Aka Faussou who is a Swedish
    national.

3.    The  appellant's  appeal  against  the   respondent's   decision   was
    considered on the papers and dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Crawford in a determination promulgated on 13 June 2013.

4.   The judge stated that the appellant claims to have entered  the  UK  in
    2001.  The sponsor had submitted a  letter  from  his  accountants  and
    correspondence from HMRC.  He paid no income tax for tax years  2008/9,
    2009/10 or 2010/11.  His Halifax  Bank  account  showed  a  balance  of
    �3,272 on 27 February 2012.  The appellant had submitted copies of  his
    payslips, which showed varying earnings between �335 and �614 per week.
     The sponsor submitted copies of his utility bills and bank statements.
     The appellant submitted a copy of a learning programme from  Southwark
    College, a copy of his driving licence and other educational documents.

5.   The judge relied on the respondent's assertion that the  appellant  had
    produced no evidence to show that he has been residing with Aka Faussou
    or that he has been dependent upon him for a period of  five  years  as
    required for the purposes of Regulation  8.   The  respondent  did  not
    accept that the appellant  was  the  extended  family  member  and  was
    dependent on an EEA national resident  in  the  UK.   Consequently  the
    respondent on the balance of probabilities was not satisfied  that  the
    appellant is the extended family member of an EEA  national  exercising
    treaty rights in the UK.

6.    The  judge  also  relied  on  the  respondent's  assertion  that   the
    appellant's leave expired on 6 February 2007.  He has no legal basis to
    reside in the UK.  Any family or private life he has established in the
    UK has been established whilst he was  resident  here  illegally.   The
    respondent considered the five stage test in Razgar  and  decided  that
    the refusal to grant the appellant a residence permit was proportionate
    to the UK's right to  control  immigration  and  does  not  breach  the
    appellant's Article 8 rights.  It was for those reasons that the  judge
    dismissed the appellant's appeal.

7.   Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy granted permission to  the  appellant  to
    appeal the judge's  decision  because  in  his  grounds  of  appeal  he
    asserted that he had submitted documents showing that he had lived with
    his father for five years after entering the UK in 2001 and that he had
    worked in 2008/2009.  The UTJ said that  the  appellant  had  submitted
    documents which showed that he entered the UK with a family  permit  in
    2001 and there were other documents which reflected that he was  living
    with his father when he arrived at the age of 16.  It was unclear  when
    these documents were served but it appears that they may well have been
    served before the hearing.

8.   The respondent submitted a reply dated 22 August 2013 saying that  they
    did not oppose the appellant's application for permission to appeal and
    invited the Tribunal to determine the appeal with a fresh oral hearing.



9.   The appellant attended the hearing with his father, Aka  Faussou.  They
    both gave oral evidence which I found credible.

10.  I accept that Mr Aka Faussou came to  the  UK  in  1999  as  a  Swedish
    national.  He became a Swedish national in 1985.  He has  lived  at  19
    Banbury House, Fenham Road, London SE15 1AA since 2000.

11.  Mr Aka Faussou said that he was studying in France many years ago  when
    he met his ex-wife who was a Swedish national.  They moved  to  Sweden.
    The appellant was born to a different woman in Ivory Coast at the  time
    he was studying in France.  The appellant lived with his mother who was
    a petty trader.  When Mr  Aka  Faussou  moved  to  Sweden  and  started
    working, he sent money to the appellant's mother to help to look  after
    him.  The appellant's mother died and the appellant went to  live  with
    his grandmother in the village for a year and was not going to  school.
    He decided that the appellant should join him in the UK and he made the
    appropriate application.

12.  Mr Aka Faussou said that  when  he  entered  the  UK  he  worked  as  a
    security officer for five to six years.  After that  he  worked  as  an
    ambulance driver, ferrying ill people from their home to  the  hospital
    and back home.  From about  2007  he  began  work  as  a  self-employed
    minicab driver.  He is now in  part-time  education  studying  interior
    design.  On this evidence I  accept  that  Mr.  Aka  Faussou  has  been
    exercising Treaty Rights soon after he arrived in the UK in 1999.

13.  Documentary evidence establishes that the appellant arrived in  the  UK
    from Ivory Coast on 23 October 2001 on an EEA Family Permit valid  from
    4 October 2001 to 4 April 2002.  In granting  the  appellant  a  family
    permit to join his father in the UK, I find that  the  respondent  must
    have been satisfied that the appellant was dependent on his father, who
    was an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in  the  UK.   Documentary
    evidence again establishes that on 27 February 2002, the appellant  was
    granted a right of residence in the UK as the family member of  an  EEA
    national exercising Treaty rights until 6 February 2006.   Again,  this
    evidence establishes that the respondent must have been satisfied as at
    27 February 2002 that the appellant who was then  aged  17  was  living
    with his father and dependent on his father.

14.  The appellant submitted documentary evidence from Crossways  Consortium
    which establishes that he studied at  Deptford  Green  School  for  two
    years from 2002 to 2004 as a sixth form  student.   He  also  submitted
    evidence from Southwark College  showing  that  in  the  academic  year
    2005/2006 he studied part-time on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays.   I
    find on this evidence that the appellant was a student until the end of
    the academic year 2005/2006.

15.  Mr Aka Faussou said that he has three children with  his  current  wife
    who is an Ivorian national, whom he married in 1998.  She came to  join
    him here in 2000.  Their children are aged 11, 7 and 3 years old.  They
    have four bedrooms in the house.  As the house had become crowded,  the
    appellant decided to move out and live  with  friends.   The  appellant
    confirmed that he moved out of the family home in 2007.   In  light  of
    this evidence I accept that the appellant was residing with his  father
    for a continuous period of 6 years, from  his  arrival  in  the  UK  in
    October 2001 until 2007.

16.   It  was  not  disputed  by  the  appellant  that  he  has  made  three
    applications for a Permanent Residence Card;  in  February  2006,  July
    2007 and 9 August 2012, and that  all  were  refused  as  a  result  of
    insufficient evidence to  establish  that  his  father  was  exercising
    treaty rights in the UK and that he was dependent on his  father  prior
    to his arrival in the UK and since he has  been  in  the  UK.   It  was
    apparent from the sponsor's evidence that when  he  made  two  previous
    applications for his wife to remain in the UK with him, and she had  on
    each occasion been granted  five  years  right  of  residence,  he  had
    submitted original documentary evidence of his employment, payslips and
    other  relevant  documents  to  the  Home  Office  in  support  of  the
    applications.  Whenever  the  appellant  asked  him  for  documents  to
    support his application he gave  him  the  documents  that  he  had.  I
    believe the sponsor's evidence that he  thought  that  the  appellant's
    application/file would be linked  with  his  wife's  file  because  the
    appellant and his wife had the same Home Office reference number, which
    was F1023904. He therefore believed that the documents he had submitted
    in support of his wife's application  would  also  be  looked  at  when
    considering the appellant's applications.  He was not  aware  that  the
    Secretary of State had not linked the two files and was also not  aware
    that the appellant had  acquired  a  different  Home  Office  reference
    number.  He believed that his payslips from 2001 which he had submitted
    in support of his wife's applications were still with the Home  Office.
    I find that the  sponsor's  mistaken  belief  had  contributed  to  the
    refusal of the appellant's applications.

17.  Miss Martin submitted that the  appellant  has  to  show  that  he  was
    dependent on his father, the EEA national, from 2001 to 2006  i.e.  the
    five years the appellant had permission to live in the UK as  a  family
    member of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights.    I  find  on  the
    evidence before me that the appellant has established this and that his
    application in February 2006 ought to have succeeded when he was  under
    21 years old and living with his father and going  to  school  had  his
    father made known to the Secretary of State that the documents  he  had
    submitted in support of his wife's application should be considered  in
    respect of  the  appellant's  application.  I  find  that  the  P60  he
    submitted for the tax year 2004/5 which shows that  he  earned  �357.77
    and paid �77.88 in  tax  would  not,  in  my  opinion,  have  made  any
    difference to the success of his  application.   This  is  because  the
    income was insufficient to support him financially.  He  was  therefore
    fully dependent on his father.  Likewise the application made  in  July
    2007 when he was 21 years and 7 months and was still living at home.


18.  The appellant submitted evidence of his Lloyds TSB Bank  statement  for
    November 2008 and April and May 2009 which indicates that he was living
    at 7 Dartington House, Union Grove, South Lambeth, London SW8 2QW.  The
    P60 for the tax year to 5 April 2009 states  that  he  earned  �3503.85
    from his employment with New Look.  His father said that the  appellant
    has had to stop working at New Look because the Home  Office  does  not
    allow him to work anymore.  The appellant said that even though  he  is
    not living at home, he has had a lot of financial help from his  father
    whenever he needed it.  I believe him.

19.  When the appellant submitted his most recent application  on  9  August
    2012, he was 27 years old.  He was no longer living in the family home,
    having moved out in 2007. The respondent said that as the appellant was
    over the age of 21, in order to qualify for a  residence  card  as  the
    extended family member of an EEA national under Regulation (8(1), he is
    required to produce evidence that he is related  to  his  EEA  national
    sponsor; evidence that he was dependent upon and, or residing with  his
    sponsor prior to entering the UK and that since he entered the  UK,  he
    has continued to be dependent upon and, or residing with his sponsor.

20.  In Moneke (EEA -OFMS) Nigeria [2011] 00341  (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal
    held:

         (i) A person claiming to be an OFM under Article 3(2) of  Directive
    2004/38/EC
         may either be a dependant or a member of the household of  the  EEA
    national:
         there are alternative ways of qualifying as an OFM.

         (ii) In either case the dependency or membership of the  household
         must be on a person who is an EEA national at the material time ...

              In this appellant's case he was not a member of  his  father's
    household when he lived in the Ivory Coast prior to his  entry  to  the
    UK.

          (v)  By  contrast  the  dependency  on  an  EEA  national  can  be
    dependency as a result of the material  remittances  sent  by  the  EEA
    national to the family member, without the pair of them having lived in
    the same country at that time before making those remittances.

              In this case the fact that the ECO issued the  appellant  with
    a Family Permit as a member of an EEA national, which  enabled  him  to
    join his father in the UK must be evidence that the ECO  was  satisfied
    that the appellant was financially dependent  on  his  father  when  he
    lived in the Ivory Coast.  I am satisfied with the  sponsor's  evidence
    that whilst the appellant's mother was alive, he sent money to  her  to
    look after the appellant when he moved to Sweden and began to work.  He
    became a Swedish national in 1985, and the appellant was  born  in  the
    same year.  This means that his financial contribution towards the care
    of the appellant must have begun soon after the appellant was born.
21.  In light of the evidence before me I find that the appellant  has  been
    financially dependent on his father since he entered the UK in  October
    2001.  He was fully dependent on his father when he lived in the family
    home until 2007 when he moved out.  I find that the income he earned in
    2008 was not sufficient  to  support  him.   He  has  had  to  give  up
    employment on the instructions of the UKBA.  Consequently, although  he
    is not living at the  family  home,  I  accept  his  and  his  father's
    evidence that he  has  been  dependent  on  his  father  for  financial
    support. I find that financial dependency has not ceased simply because
    the appellant no  longer  lives  at  home.   His  father  continues  to
    exercise treaty rights.

22.  I allow the appellant's appeal.
