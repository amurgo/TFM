Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Reynolds, of Counsel instructed by Wilson
Solicitors LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholls allowing the  appeal  of
    the respondent against the decision made on 7 March  2014  to  issue  a
    deportation order against him.  The respondent  will  from  now  on  be
    referred to as the claimant.

2.   The claimant is a citizen of Ghana  born  on  10  September  1972.   He
    entered the UK on 9 January 2005  with  entry  clearance  to  join  his
    spouse, Nicolet Lewis whom he had married  in  Ghana  on  11  September
    2004.  He and his wife have three children, Maya Suzanne Wilson born 25
    August 2007, Maliyah Rosemary Wilson born 10 November 2008 and  Mikaela
    Mariah Wilson born on 8 November 2010.  All the children were  born  in
    the UK and are British citizens.  The claimant was  granted  indefinite
    leave to remain in the UK on 22 December 2006.

3.   On 28 January 2013 the claimant was convicted at  the  Crown  Court  at
    Wood Green of conspiracy to supply class B controlled drugs and  on  23
    April 2013 he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.   He  completed
    his sentence and was released on 7 April 2014.   At  the  date  of  the
    hearing of his appeal he was on licence.

4.   It was as a result of the  claimant's  conviction  that  the  appellant
    decided to make a deportation order against the claimant under  Section
    32 of the UK Borders Act 2007.  The claimant appealed on the basis that
    his deportation would interfere with his human rights under  Article  8
    of the ECHR.

5.   Following consideration of all  the  evidence  before  him,  the  judge
    allowed the  claimant's  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds.   The  two
    concluding paragraphs are as follows:

         "30. Taking into consideration all the  factors  I  have  mentioned
             above, including those about the behaviour and health problems
             of  the  children,  the  carious  care  arrangements  for  the
             children, the best interests of the children and adding in the
             health of the Appellant's wife, who would be the primary carer
             for the children if the Appellant is deported,  and  balancing
             those  factors  with  the  weighty  public  interest  in   the
             deportation of foreign criminals, I  find  that  it  has  been
             demonstrated to the required standard of probability that  the
             deportation of the Appellant would have unduly  harsh  effects
             on both his wife and, particularly, on his three children.   I
             find, therefore, that Exception 2 in section  117C(5)  applies
             and that in this case, in accordance with section 117C(3), the
             public interest  does  not  require  the  deportation  of  the
             Appellant.  I find that the provisions of paragraph 399  apply
             to this Appellant and that his deportation is not required  in
             the public interest, in accordance with paragraph 398(c).


         31.  I find, therefore,  that  Exception  1  in  section  33(2)  UK
             Borders Act 2007  applies  to  this  Appellant  and  that  his
             deportation  would  breach  the  article  8  rights   of   the
             Appellant, his wife and their  three  children.   Accordingly,
             the deportation order made under section 32(5) should not have
             been made and the decision to do so was not in accordance with
             law."


6.   The appellant  appealed  arguing  firstly  that  the  judge  materially
    misdirected himself in law in  finding  that  the  claimant  meets  the
    exceptions set out in paragraph 117C of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002. The appellant submitted  that  it  is  not  unduly
    harsh for the claimant's partner and children to have to remain in  the
    United Kingdom without him or travel with him to continue  their  lives
    in Ghana.  The family have a choice as to how to continue  their  lives
    together.  Their circumstances do not outweigh the public  interest  in
    deporting the claimant.

7.   Secondly, the appellant argued that the public interest  has  not  been
    properly balanced by the judge against  the  claimant's  circumstances.
    This ground relied on the Court of Appeal's judgment  in  SS  (Nigeria)
    [2013] EWCA Civ 550 where the Court of  Appeal  held  that  the  public
    interest in deporting foreign criminals  is  "pressing"  and  that  the
    interest would be injured where a foreign criminal is not deported  for
    a serious offence.  It was submitted in the grounds that  the  claimant
    has  committed  a  highly  serious  offence  which  has  far   reaching
    consequences  and  the  judge  has  failed  to  properly  balance   the
    considerations in paragraph 117 of the 2002 Act  against  other  public
    interest considerations.  The judge's assessment of the public interest
    was fundamentally flawed and therefore the decision to allow the appeal
    was not in accordance with the law.

8.   First-tier Tribunal Judge McClure granted permission as follows:

         "3.  This appeal in part deals with section 117C of the 2002 Act as
             amended and exception 2 as  set  out  in  subsection  5.   The
             appellant has a partner and three  children.   The  judge  has
             dealt with the deterioration in the behaviour of the  children
             whilst the appellant was in custody and the medical conditions
             suffered by the partner and children and the partner's mother.
              However it is arguable in concluding that it would be  unduly
             harsh the judge has not identified  any  factors  which  would
             render  the  deportation  unduly  harsh  on  the  partner  and
             children.  Inevitably deportation may  affect  the  children's
             behaviour but it is arguable that the judge has failed to give
             valid or adequate reasons why such would be  unduly  harsh  in
             the circumstances."

9.   Mr Avery relied on the grounds submitted on behalf of the Secretary  of
    State.  He argued that the judge  did  not  properly  engage  with  the
    public interest consideration and the nature of the  offence  committed
    by the claimant.  He argued that at paragraph 29 the judge merely  said
    that the offence was serious.  He did not mention  the  nature  of  the
    offence  which  involved  the  supply  of  cannabis   worth   ï¿½250,000.
    According to the sentencing judge the claimant was a  significant  part
    of the operation.  By saying the offence  was  serious  the  judge  was
    glossing over the serious nature of the  offence.   He  further  argued
    that the judge did not approach the unduly harsh test in an even-handed
    way.

10.  Mr Avery  submitted  that  there  were  two  technical  errors  on  the
    approach to Section 117C.  The judge said that because he had found  in
    favour of the claimant, under Section 117C(5), then it  means  that  it
    was not in the public interest to deport the claimant.  Mr  Avery  said
    that this was wrong.  The approach requires the judge to  look  at  the
    overall situation.  His failure to do that undermined his findings.

11.  With regard to the unduly harsh test, Mr Avery  submitted  that  it  is
    not sufficient to find that  the  circumstances  of  the  claimant  are
    harsh.  The test is "unduly" harsh.   The  judge  therefore  needed  to
    identify what makes the  claimant's  circumstances  more  serious  than
    harsh.  The judge finds that it would be difficult for  the  claimant's
    wife to cope with the care of three  children.   The  only  point  that
    might set this case apart is the illness of one of  the  daughters  but
    the judge does not  identify  this  as  the  determining  factor.   The
    judge's overall view was that the difficulties the family would face in
    the absence of the claimant satisfies the  test.   This  is  the  wrong
    approach.

12.  Counsel took me through the key facts in this case  starting  with  the
    claimant's immigration history and the fact that  he  has  a  wife  and
    three children who are all British.  He said that prior  to  committing
    the  offence,  the  claimant  was  of  good  character.   He  has  been
    rehabilitated.  The risk of the claimant re-offending and causing  harm
    is low.  Counsel took me through the health problems of the  claimant's
    wife and the three children.  In particular he referred to  the  second
    child, Maliyah who according to the evidence was 5  years  old  at  the
    time of the hearing and suffered from ADHD in respect of which she  has
    been recognised as disabled and is paid a disability living allowance.

13.  Counsel submitted that the grant of leave which  said  that  the  judge
    failed to give adequate reasons  why  the  factors  identified  therein
    would be unduly harsh is not a ground for appeal because the respondent
    has not challenged the conclusion that the effect of deportation of the
    claimant would be unduly harsh on  the  wife  and  the  children.   The
    application was put  in  this  way  that  notwithstanding  the  judge's
    findings, the unduly harsh requirement has not  been  properly  weighed
    with other factors.  Counsel submitted that  the  appellant's  argument
    that the judge has not  engaged  with  the  facts  of  the  offence  is
    incorrect when we look at paragraph 6 and 9 of the  determination.   It
    is also incorrect for the appellant to argue that the judge  failed  to
    give proper weight to the public interest if we look  at  the  findings
    that the judge made at paragraphs 29 and 28.   The  judge  applied  the
    correct test in respect of his consideration of unduly harsh by setting
    it out at paragraphs 24 and 30.  The judge gave reasons why considering
    all the evidence and the  facts  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    claimant's wife and three children for him to be deported.

14.  Having considered all the arguments, I find  that  the  judge  did  not
    make an error of law and I give my reasons below.

15.  The judge set out the facts of claimant's case  from  paragraphs  6  to
    17. The appellant does not dispute any of these  facts.  They  included
    the claimant's description of the nature of  the  offence.   He  became
    addicted to online gambling and  incurred  significant  gambling  debts
    which amounted in the end to ï¿½15,000.  He told  the  probation  officer
    who prepared the pre-sentence report that he thought he  was  borrowing
    money from a loan shark but it turned out to be from a drug dealer.  He
    agreed to look after a quantity of drugs in return for the  debt  being
    cancelled.  He arranged to store the drugs at his  sister's  flat  from
    where they were due to be collected.   He  admitted  to  the  probation
    officer that he knew that what he was doing was  criminal  but  he  was
    anxious to clear the gambling debt.  He explained that as he had looked
    after the drugs and even though he was caught, the  gambling  debt  had
    been cancelled and he did not owe anybody money.  Whilst in  prison  he
    had undertaken a course to control his  gambling  addiction.   To  make
    sure that he could learn the lessons, he had actually done  the  course
    twice.  He had also studied and obtained a diploma in criminology.

16.  The judge recorded the evidence of the claimant and his wife as to  the
    health problems and difficulties of  the  children,  partly  caused  by
    their enforced separation  whilst  he  was  in  prison.   The  claimant
    himself  said  he  suffered  from  depression  and  suicidal  thoughts,
    including one attempted suicide on 26 April 2013.  His eldest daughter,
    Maya, had suffered from panic attacks and behavioural problems when  he
    was sent to prison but was much better since he had been released.  His
    second daughter, Maliyah, had had severe behavioural  problems  from  a
    very  young  age  and  had  been  diagnosed  with   attention   deficit
    hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  which  was  the  subject  of   medical
    treatment from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services of  East
    London NHS Foundation Trust.  The claimant produced a bundle containing
    a report from Dr Helen Reynolds dated 16 August 2013 and a letter  from
    the Department for  Work  and  Pensions  dated  7  October  2013  which
    confirmed the payment of disability  living  allowance  in  respect  of
    Maliyah.  The  claimant  testified  that  although  her  behaviour  had
    improved since he had been released, she remained  a  very  challenging
    child and he feared for her continued wellbeing  if  he  was  deported.
    The youngest child, Mikaela, had been too young to really be aware that
    he was away in prison and had not suffered any  particular  behavioural
    problems, although Mrs Lewis-Wilson said that while the claimant was in
    prison, Mikaela had started to stutter when she was at school.  She had
    been referred for speech therapy but the problem had now improved.

17.  The claimant's wife said she had suffered health  problems  and  stress
    whilst he was in prison because of the difficulties of coping with  the
    three young children.  She had not been aware of his gambling  addition
    nor his arrangement to  look  after  the  drugs,  until  her  bank  had
    contacted her about some transactions  showing  on  her  bank  account,
    which he had initiated.  She was not happy  and  thought  that  he  had
    broken her trust in him.  When he was  in  prison  she  found  it  very
    difficult to cope with the three children and had to seek help from her
    own mother and medical assistance.  She receives weekly therapy at  St.
    Leonards Hospital  because  of  her  depression.   She  takes  sleeping
    tablets and suffers from vertigo and skin problems  for  which  she  is
    prescribed  medication.   She  said   her   conditions   had   improved
    considerably since the claimant was released  from  prison.   She  also
    confirmed that her mother is awaiting major heart  surgery  within  the
    next few weeks and that she operates as  her  mother's  primary  carer.
    Although she has a brother in the UK who provides  some  care,  he  has
    been  diagnosed  as  paranoid  schizophrenic  which  causes  additional
    problems.

18.  Mrs Lewis confirmed that she would not move to live in Ghana  with  the
    claimant because of the arrangements for the children's  schooling  and
    medical care, even though she had found it extremely difficult to  look
    after the children while the claimant was in prison.  She did not  know
    the language, culture or customs of Ghana, having lived in the  UK  for
    21 years.  She confirmed that one of the causes of the behavioural  and
    physical problems of her children was the stress and turmoil caused  by
    the claimant's imprisonment.  The unsettlement in the home life had had
    a drastic effect on Maliyah.

19.  The judge then set out his findings and conclusions  at  paragraphs  20
    to 32.  At paragraph 20 he rightly said that the  appeal  arises  under
    the automatic deportation provisions contained in Section 32 of the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.  He set out that the claimant is a national of  Ghana
    and was convicted in the UK of conspiracy to supply a class B drug.  He
    is therefore a foreign  criminal  within  the  definition  set  out  in
    Section 32(1).  By Section  32(4)  there  is  a  declaration  that  the
    deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the public  good  and
    by Section 32(5) the Secretary of State must make a deportation  order.
    The judge then said that there are five exceptions  to  the  provisions
    set out in Section 33.   The  only  one  relevant  to  this  appeal  is
    Exception 1 which is set out in Section 33(2).  That exception  to  the
    automatic deportation provisions arises "where  removal  of  a  foreign
    criminal in pursuance  of  a  deportation  order  would  breach  (a)  a
    person's Convention rights, or (b)  the  United  Kingdom's  obligations
    under the Refugee Convention.

20.  The judge at paragraph 21 properly directly himself that  in  assessing
    whether the decision to deport the claimant  amounts  to  a  breach  of
    Article 8 of the ECHR, he must take into consideration  the  provisions
    of Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  and  in
    particular, the provisions  of  Sections  117B  and  117C.   The  judge
    rightly found that Exception 1 in Section 117C(4) does  not  apply  and
    this is because the claimant did not argue that there were  significant
    obstacles to his integration in Ghana.

21.  The judge then considered Exception 2 in Section 117C(5) which  applies
    where the foreign criminal has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
    with a qualifying partner or qualifying child and "the  effect  of  the
    claimant's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly  harsh".
    In addition the judge said the provisions of paragraphs 398 and 399  of
    the Immigration Rules must be taken into consideration.  He found  that
    399(b) applies the same provisions where the person has a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with a partner who  is  a  British  citizen  or
    settled in the UK provided that the relationship was formed at  a  time
    when the immigration status of the  person  to  be  deported  was  "not
    precarious" and it would be unduly harsh for the partner to live in the
    country to which the person would be deported  "because  of  compelling
    circumstances over and above  those  described  in  paragraph  EX.2  of
    Appendix FM" and it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain in
    the UK without the person who is to be deported.

22.  The judge said at paragraph 24 that the basis of the case  put  forward
    by the claimant is that there would be unduly harsh consequences on his
    wife and children if he is deported.   I find that this meant that  the
    judge was required to consider Exception 2 in Section 117C(5).  It also
    means that if the judge accepted that Exception 2 applied  as  in  this
    case  then  the  public  interest  does  not  require  the   claimant's
    deportation as in  subsection  3  of  117C.   That,  in  my  considered
    opinion, seems to be interpretation of Section 117C(3).    Consequently
    Mr. Avery's submission that the judge erred in adopting  this  approach
    was without merit.

23.  I find that it is inaccurate for the appellant to argue that the  judge
    failed to consider whether the circumstances, although harsh, would  be
    unduly harsh.  Throughout his findings at paragraph 24 to 30 the  judge
    was considering whether the circumstances of the  claimant's  wife  and
    children were such that it would be  unduly  harsh  on  them  were  the
    claimant to  be  deported  from  the  UK.   The  judge  considered  the
    significant health problems of Maliyah  who  has  been  diagnosed  with
    ADHD.  He noted from the full report of  Dr  Helen  Reynolds  dated  16
    August 2013 that this is a serious condition giving rise to  some  very
    difficult problems.   The  seriousness  of  the  child's  condition  is
    clearly demonstrated by the decision to pay disability living allowance
    for her.  At the date of the hearing she was still only 5 years of age.
     Her mother testified that she has recently  shown  signs  of  epilepsy
    from which, apparently, the claimant suffered as a child.  Whilst there
    was no direct medical evidence to support  that  testimony,  the  judge
    said it was consistent with everything else and he had no hesitation in
    accepting it on a balance of probabilities.  I note that  this  finding
    was not challenged by the respondent.

24.  The judge noted that Maliyah has a comprehensive medical  care  package
    which is amply demonstrated in the documents.  The  child's  school  is
    very well aware of the problems and there is a  close  liaison  between
    the school and home.  He had no direct evidence about the  availability
    of such a care package in Ghana but in his experience of other appeals,
    it is unlikely that a co-ordinated and consistent approach between  the
    educational, medical and home services would be readily arranged.   The
    judge  accepted  the  evidence  that  the  disruption  of  those   care
    arrangements would be likely to  have  serious  consequences  for  this
    small child.  I find  that  the  judge's  use  of  the  words  "serious
    consequences" fits in with the consideration of unduly harsh.

25.  The judge was impressed by the evidence that  was  given  by  both  the
    claimant and his wife about the circumstances and  the  impact  on  the
    children of his  arrest  and  imprisonment.   The  judge  accepted  the
    claimant's wife's evidence that she would not take the children to live
    in Ghana because of the disruption to their education and health plans,
    as well as her own problems of her health and her lack of knowledge  of
    life in  that  country.   The  judge  accepted  the  claimant's  wife's
    evidence that  while  he  was  imprisoned  both  of  the  two  children
    exhibited behavioural problems, although they have now  improved  since
    the claimant was released in April 2014.  The judge said  there  is  no
    medical diagnosis in either case  but  the  disruption  caused  by  the
    sudden disappearance of one of  the  parents  must  be  recognised  and
    cannot be underestimated.  In light of  all  this  evidence  the  judge
    found that if the claimant were to be  deported,  that  would  cause  a
    separation of this family which would last for the minimum of ten years
    specified for deportations.

26.  The judge then assessed  the  best  interests  of  the  children  as  a
    primary consideration.  He took into account the general  character  of
    the claimant which is shown in the  supportive  documents  he  produced
    from the Prison Chaplain at HM Brixton, the Volunteers' Project Manager
    of WWV, his Offender Manager  at  the  London  Probation  Service,  the
    letter from the pastor of his church and his general behaviour while in
    prison.  The judge said he saw nothing in his demeanour at the  hearing
    that was inconsistent with the positive comments that were made in  the
    various character references and he gave weight to those comments.   He
    said there was nothing in the evidence which suggested that  the  three
    children would be better off by losing day-to-day  contact  with  their
    father.

27.  He found that the claimant had demonstrated to  the  required  standard
    of probability that if he is deported from the UK it will not be in the
    best interests of the three vulnerable children on whom his removal  is
    likely to have a serious adverse effect.

28.  I find that  the  judge  properly  engaged  with  the  public  interest
    consideration.  At paragraph 21  the  judge  recognised  the  statutory
    declaration that the deportation of foreign criminals is in the  public
    interest and that the more serious the offence,  the  greater  is  that
    public interest.  This is a direct quotation from SS (Nigeria) although
    the judge does not mention this.  I accept that  the  judge  does.   At
    paragraph 28 the judge again mentions that the public interest  in  the
    deportation of foreign criminals  is  declared  by  statute  and  is  a
    substantial and weighty consideration.    At  paragraph  29  the  judge
    accepted Counsel's submission  that  the  offence  which  the  claimant
    committed was serious, as the sentencing remarks  of  the  trial  judge
    amply demonstrated.  I accept that the judge did not mention the nature
    of the offence which involved the supply of  cannabis  worth  ï¿½250,000.
    This is however not material in light of Counsel's acceptance that  the
    offence which the claimant committed was  serious,  as  the  sentencing
    remarks of the trial judge amply demonstrated.  Consequently, I do  not
    find that by saying the offence was serious the judge was glossing over
    the serious nature of the offence.

29.  Furthermore, I find that the judge was entitled to consider all of  the
    reports before him about the claimant which demonstrated  his  remorse,
    his rehabilitation and make an assessment that he has a low risk of re-
    offending.  The  offender  manager  reported  very  positively  on  his
    progress since his release from prison  and  confirmed  that  low  risk
    assessment.  The judge was particularly impressed by the reference from
    the project manager  at  WWV  and  the  confirmation  of  the  positive
    contribution the claimant is now making.

30.  Taking all  these  factors  into  account  the  judge  arrived  at  the
    conclusions  at  paragraphs  30  and  31.   I  find  that  the  judge's
    conclusions do not disclose an error of law.

31.  The judge's decision allowing the claimant's appeal shall stand.
