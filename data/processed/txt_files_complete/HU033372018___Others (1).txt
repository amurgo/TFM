For the Appellants:    Miss D Ofei-Kwatia (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants in this appeal comprise a family all of whom hold Indian
    nationality.  The first and second appellants are the  parents  of  the
    third and fourth appellants.  The first and second appellants  came  to
    the United Kingdom as a student and her dependant partner respectively.
     They entered together in August 2009 and secured extensions  of  leave
    until June 2014.  However they were refused  further  extensions.   The
    third and fourth appellants were born in the UK in May 2010 and  August
    2012 respectively.

 2. In September 2017 the appellants applied  for  leave  on  human  rights
    grounds, in large part basing their applications on the fact  that  the
    third appellant had lived continuously in the UK for  more  than  seven
    years and arguing that it will be unreasonable to expect her  to  leave
    the UK.

 3. The respondent refused the applications on 11 January 2018. In  respect
    of the first appellant the respondent alleged that in June 2013 she had
    obtained a TOEIC certificate from Educational Testing Service (ETS)  by
    deception.  She had taken the test at Eden College.

 4. The appellants appealed.  In  the  notices  of  appeal  the  appellants
    indicated that they wished  their  appeals  to  be  decided  without  a
    hearing.  Reduced appeal fees of ï¿½80 were paid.  Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Moran decided the appeals without a hearing on  22  April
    2018.  His decision dismissing the appeals was promulgated on 27  April
    2018.  In paragraph 2 of his decision the judge stated as follows:

         "Both parties have consented to these appeals being  heard  on  the
         papers.  The appellants have not requested an oral  hearing  as  is
         their right.  Both parties have had ample time to  submit  whatever
         evidence they wish to be considered in the determination  of  these
         appeals.  It is in the interests of justice to decide these appeals
         in accordance with the wishes of the parties, i.e. to  decide  them
         on the papers."

 5. In the grounds seeking permission to appeal various assertions are made
    amounting to a denial  that  the  appellants  had  consented  to  their
    appeals being decided on the papers.  In short it was alleged that  the
    appellants had changed their minds and notified the Tribunal  of  their
    decision to have their appeals heard at an oral hearing.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal because  it
    was arguable that a request had been made for an  oral  hearing  on  21
    March 2018.  However in relation to the claim that Tribunal  staff  had
    informed the appellants' solicitors by telephone that  the  matter  had
    already been determined when it had not been there was no  evidence  on
    the Tribunal's file to confirm this.

 7. Therefore the grant of permission to appeal stated that the appellants'
    solicitors must produce either contemporaneous evidence in the form  of
    attendance notes or a witness statement to support their assertion.  It
    is fair to say that evidence has now been  produced.   The  appellants'
    solicitors have provided further evidence comprising a statement by the
    caseworker concerned confirming that he telephoned the Tribunal and was
    told the decision had already been made, as a consequence of  which  it
    was not felt necessary to file further evidence.

 8. The parties were in agreement that the decision should therefore be set
    aside.

 9. It is as clear as it possibly can be that it was the  absence  of  oral
    and other evidence being submitted on behalf of  the  appellants  which
    led to the decision to dismiss the appeals.  In upholding the  decision
    that the first appellant had used deception by submitting a  fraudulent
    ETS language certificate the judge noted that the burden shifted to her
    to provide an innocent explanation.   He  noted  that  this  is  not  a
    particularly difficult task it is said for many appellants but in  this
    case the first  appellant  had  provided  very  little  information  or
    evidence generally and in  particular  to  address  the  allegation  of
    fraud.  The judge found she  had  not  engaged  sufficiently  with  the
    allegation against  her  and  therefore  the  allegation  made  by  the
    respondent was proved.

10. In relation to the proportionality of  removal  having  found  that  it
    would be in the best interests of the third appellant to  continue  her
    family life in the UK the judge found that it was not overwhelmingly or
    emphatically so.  As a qualifying child there was  a  presumption  that
    leave would be granted to all  of  the  appellants  unless  there  were
    powerful and strong reasons why it should not be.

11. Whilst the first appellant's fraud was a matter striking at  the  heart
    of the integrity of the system of immigration  control  it  might  well
    have been outweighed if the third appellant had been  older  and  there
    were more difficulties in integrating into life  in  India.  Again  the
    appellants had not provided much evidence regarding  the  establishment
    of private life in the UK.  In other words it  is  critical  to  decide
    whether the judge was right to proceed with the appeal on the papers or
    whether there was procedural unfairness in the decision not to do so.

12. For the reasons I have already  given  I  am  satisfied  that  had  the
    message from the Tribunal not been relayed as  it  was  the  appellants
    would have filed evidence to address these crucial issues.

13. I therefore allow the appeals of the appellants to the extent that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside although I would  like
    to add that there was no fault on the part of Judge Moran.

14. Having considered the  Senior  President's  Practice  Direction  of  15
    September 2012, I make  an  order  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  of  the
    Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. It is clear the  appellants
    have not had a fair hearing and therefore this is an  appropriate  case
    to remit to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh  hearing  before  a
    different judge.   None  of  the  findings  made  by  Judge  Moran  are
    preserved.

15. If the appellants wish to have an oral hearing,  then  the  appropriate
    fees will have to be paid before the case can be listed.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  contains  a
material error of law and is set aside. The appeal is remitted to the First-
tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing on all issues.
