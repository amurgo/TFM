Officer
For the Respondent:        The respondent in person. No representation



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellant is the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  to
      avoid confusion in this determination I shall  refer  to  her  as  the
      "Claimant".

   2. The Respondent is a citizen of Egypt who was born on the 2 April 1978.
       He made application for a grant of a  family  member  residence  card
      under the Immigration, European Economic Area Regulations 2006.

   3. The Claimant's reason for refusal letter suggests that it has not been
      demonstrated  by  the  respondent  that  the  EEA  Sponsor  has   been
      exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

   4. The Respondent appealed that decision taken by the Claimant on the  17
      April 2014 and his appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge James
      without an oral hearing on the 16 June 2014 at  Harmondsworth.   Judge
      James noted that there was a single payslip in the name of the Sponsor
      which was dated the 3 June 2014, which referred to a BACS  payment  of
      ï¿½343.28 net.   The  cumulative  figures  confirm  that  only  tax  and
      national insurance to date are the ones that arise  for  the  payslip.
      The payslip is evidence that the EEA Sponsor has been working and thus
      exercising her treaty rights.  On that basis Judge James  allowed  his
      appeal.

   5. The Claimant challenged the decision  on  the  basis  that  the  judge
      should have examined the facts as at the date of  the  appeal  hearing
      and reliance was placed on the case of Boodhoo and  Another  (the  EEA
      Regs: Relevant Evidence) [2013] UKUT 00346. The Claimant's grounds  of
      appeal suggests that the Immigration Judge had no evidence before  him
      to show that as at the date of the hearing on the 16  July  2014,  the
      Sponsor was working and that the only evidence the Respondent had  was
      a payslip for the Sponsor dated the 3 June 2014, which was  more  than
      one month before the hearing.

   6. It was properly pointed out by the Presenting Officer before  me  that
      in fact the grounds of appeal contain errors of fact.

   7. The first is that the hearing before the judge  was  on  the  16  June
      2014, not 16 July 2014 and since it was  a  hearing  without  an  oral
      hearing the last payslip immediately before  the  hearing  would  have
      been that of the 3 June 2014, which was of course, the  payslip  which
      had been submitted by the respondent.

   8. In the circumstances she suggested that the grounds of  appeal  failed
      to identify any error  of  law  in  the  determination  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge James and invited me to produce a  short  determination
      recording that fact.  I am grateful to her for that submission.

   9. I believe she is correct, having examined the  determination  and  the
      evidence submitted.  I  find  that  the  determination  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge James does not contain any error on the point  of  law.
      This decision shall stand.

Richard Chalkley
Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley
