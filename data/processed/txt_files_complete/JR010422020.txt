                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -


JUDGE SMITH: The Applicant challenges the decision  of  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer ("ECO") dated 5 March 2020 refusing him a two-year  multi-entry
    visit visa to the United Kingdom.

 2. The Applicant is a national of Sri Lanka who requires such  a  visa  to
    visit the UK. The circumstances of this case are  somewhat  unusual  in
    that that Applicant is not seeking to come to the UK to  visit  it  but
    rather seeks a visit visa in order that he can travel onwards and  back
    via the UK to Bermuda where he has been given a permit to  work  for  a
    housekeeping service for a period of two years from  November  2019  to
    November 2021. In order to be landed in Bermuda he is required to  show
    that he has a visit visa from either the UK, the  US  or  Canada  which
    extends for 45 days beyond the expiry of the work permit.  The  US  has
    refused to grant him a visa for essentially the same reasons  as  given
    by the ECO in the decision under challenge.

 3. The Respondent's decision reads as follows:

         "I have refused your application for a visit visa because I am  not
         satisfied that you meet the requirements of  paragraph(s)  V4.2  of
         Appendix V: Immigration Rules for Visitors because:

         You have applied for a two year multiple entry visit visa,  as  you
         state you intend to pass through the United  Kingdom  en  route  to
         Bermuda. I have carefully  considered  the  evidence  provided  and
         written statements you have made, however I am  not  satisfied  you
         have  met  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  on  this
         occasion.

         In support of your application  you  have  provided  an  employment
         letter issued by Complete Housekeeping Service, a company based  in
         Bermuda, and a work permit issued by the Bermudan authorities valid
         from 11/11/2019 until 11/11/2021. The work permit explicitly states
         that you will be required to hold a multiple re-entry visa for  the
         country you intend to transit which must be valid  45  days  beyond
         the expiry of your work permit.

         Therefore, it is clear from the above that your circumstances  will
         have significantly  changed  after  your  work  permit  expires  in
         November 2021 as your permission to work will have ceased  and  you
         will no longer have valid leave to remain and work in Bermuda.  You
         have applied for a visit  visa  requesting  that  the  expiry  date
         postdates the expiry of your work permit. However, as the documents
         and information submitted in your  application  confirm  that  your
         circumstances will change before the visa  expiry  date  I  am  not
         satisfied that you have shown that your circumstances will be  such
         that you would leave, after entering the UK, following  the  expiry
         of your Bermuda work permit.

         For the reasons above I am not  satisfied  that  your  purpose  for
         applying for  a  UK  visit  visa  meets  the  requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules or that you will leave the UK at  the  end  of  a
         visit. Your application for a visit visa  has  been  refused  under
         paragraph V4.2(a) & (c)."

 4. In essence therefore, the Respondent does not accept that the Applicant
    is a genuine visitor because the Respondent does not  accept  that  the
    Applicant would return to Sri Lanka after the expiry of his work permit
    at which point he would be able, if granted a visit visa, to enter  the
    UK as a visitor for a period of 45 days. The  Entry  Clearance  Manager
    has reviewed the decision but merely upholds it and I have no  need  to
    set out what is said by the ECM.

 5. The Applicant's grounds of challenge as pleaded  are  extremely  vague.
    The most that can be discerned from them is that it is  said  that  the
    Respondent's decision is contrary  to  the  evidence  and  has  assumed
    facts, that the decision was not in  accordance  with  the  Immigration
    Rules and that it was unfair and made without due regard for  the  law.
    It  is  also  suggested  that  the  Respondent  should  have  exercised
    discretion by granting a shorter term of visa. I do not understand  how
    that would assist the Applicant since it is my understanding  that  the
    Bermudan authorities would not allow him to take  up  the  work  permit
    offer unless he had a visa of adequate length,  that  is  to  say,  one
    which extends to 45 days after expiry of the work permit.

 6. I remind those representing the Applicant of the need properly to plead
    the case in the  future,  see  in  particular  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    observations at [67] to [69] in Talpada v  Secretary  of  State  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 841. It is not good enough to leave the Respondent guessing as
    to the nature of  the  challenge  until  the  eleventh  hour  when  the
    properly pleaded case is set out. However,  the  case  has  been  fully
    developed in the skeleton argument and oral submissions and  I  do  not
    need to return to the pleaded grounds again.

 7. Permission was granted by Judge Kamara on the papers on 12  June  2020.
    The Respondent filed detailed grounds on 21 August 2020.

 8. A point is taken in the  Respondent's  summary  grounds  regarding  the
    possibility of the Applicant applying  instead  for  a  direct  airside
    transit visa. Leaving aside that this is not  a  point  raised  in  the
    decision under challenge, I do not understand  that  point  now  to  be
    pursued. It is not in any event a meritorious one. As I understand  it,
    it is now accepted that the Bermudan Regulations require a  visit  visa
    and not simply a transit one. In any event, it  is  not  clear  that  a
    transit visa can be applied for to  cover  a  sufficient  period  which
    would extend beyond the end of  the  work  permit  as  the  Regulations
    require. For that reason, perhaps the Respondent does not now  rely  on
    it. It would in any event amount to ex post facto reasoning.

 9. The Applicant raised in his skeleton argument for  the  first  time  an
    argument that the refusal is discriminatory since no Asian subcontinent
    individuals would be able to enter Bermuda as work permit holders based
    on the reasoning given by the ECO. Mr Burrett confirmed however that he
    was  not  pursuing  this  as  a  discrimination  challenge  for   which
    permission to amend would be required; it  was  merely  an  observation
    about the way in which the  decision  maker  approached  the  case.  He
    accepted that it did not add much to the case and did not  develop  the
    point in oral submissions.

10. The way in which the submissions proceeded therefore was on  the  basis
    of the general thrust of the skeletons on both sides.  The  issues  are
    whether the decision is Wednesbury unreasonable on the basis that it is
    perverse, and whether the  decision  maker  has  failed  to  take  into
    account relevant considerations or  has  taken  account  of  irrelevant
    ones.

11. The Applicant makes the point that the decision is  unduly  speculative
    as the focus of the decision is what will happen at the end of the work
    permit when the applicant says that he will return to Sri Lanka via the
    UK. I do not think that can be described  as  speculative  as  that  is
    precisely the reason why the Applicant has and has been obliged to seek
    a multi-entry visit visa in the first place. Without  it  the  Bermudan
    authorities will not land him in order to take up his work permit.

12. The reasons given for refusing the visa are that the Applicant is not a
    genuine visitor under V 4.2 (a) and that he  is  seeking  entry  for  a
    purpose not permitted by the Rules under V 4.2(c). That latter point is
    not because of the nature of the visa sought as Mr Burrett  and  I  had
    initially thought. It is clear from the Rules and policy guidance  that
    transit visitors are included in the Rules as a potential purpose.  The
    point is that if the Applicant is not a genuine visitor, then he is not
    seeking entry for a purpose within the Rules and therefore  fails  also
    under V 4.2(c).

13. The guidance to which  my  attention  was  drawn  and  which  has  some
    relevance to this case reads as follows:

         "Assessing an applicant's genuine intentions to visit

         ... You  must  be  satisfied  that  the  applicant  meets  all  the
         requirements of V 4.2 to V 4.10 of  the  visitor  rules  and  is  a
         genuine visitor ... If you are not satisfied, you must refuse their
         application. A visitor can enter,  or  extend  their  stay,  to  do
         different permitted activities but they should be expected to  have
         a main reason or reasons for visiting, for example for business  or
         a holiday, and be able to provide  details.  However,  particularly
         where a visitor holds a long-term, multiple entry visit visa  valid
         for 2, 5 or 10 years it is likely that their  reason  for  visiting
         will differ over time. This is permissible, provided they  continue
         to intend to undertake one or more permitted visitor activity ...

         Assessing an applicant's personal circumstances

         ... The following factors will help you assess if an applicant is a
         genuine visitor:

           . their previous immigration history, including visits to the UK
             and other countries

         ...

           . their financial circumstances as well as their family,  social
             and economic background

           . their personal and economic ties to their country of residence

         ...

           . whether, in your judgment, the information and the reasons for
             the  visit  or  for  extending  their  stay  provided  by  the
             applicant are  credible  and  correspond  to  their  personal,
             family, social and economic background.

         ...

         Frequent or successive visits: how to assess  if  an  applicant  is
         making the UK their main home or place of work

         You should look at:

           . the purpose of the visit and intended length of stay stated

         ...

           . the purpose of return trips to the visitor's home country  and
             if this is used only to seek re-entry to the UK

           . the links they have with their home country ...

         ...

         Grounds for doubting the applicant' s intentions to visit the UK

         ... This  is  not  an  exhaustive  list  but  may  help  with  your
         assessment. If:

           . the applicant has few or no family and economic ties to  their
             country of residence and has several family members in the  UK
             for example a person with most of their family in the  UK  and
             no job or study in their own country may be considered to have
             few ties

         ...

           . the information that has been provided or the  reasons  stated
             by the applicant are not credible."

14. The essential point is whether the  decision  takes  into  account  all
    relevant factors and is a rational one on the point of  genuineness  of
    the Applicant's intentions. The ECO's reasons  for  doubting  that  the
    Applicant is a genuine visitor are essentially because the ECO  is  not
    satisfied that the Applicant would return to Sri Lanka due to the  lack
    of ties to that country. For that reason, the ECO is not satisfied that
    the Applicant would return after the work permit expires.

15. Mr Burrett says that this is irrational because the Applicant  says  he
    will go back and  for  other  reasons.  It  is  self-evident  that  the
    Applicant does not have a job in Sri Lanka as he is going  to  work  in
    another country. Mr Burrett  points  out  that  the  Applicant  has  an
    employment history which is true but the focus of the  ECO  has  to  be
    what will be the position when the Applicant returns to Sri  Lanka  via
    the UK at the end of the work permit at which time  he  will  not  have
    employment[pic]

16. As Mr Fracyk points out, it is not said what will  be  the  Applicant's
    income and expenditure in Bermuda. If that information  were  included,
    it might provide some indication about what his financial circumstances
    might be at that point in time. Mr Burrett says that the Applicant will
    be more financially stable as Bermuda is  a  rich  country  but  as  Mr
    Fracyk points out, it is for the Applicant to show the  genuineness  of
    his intentions and he said nothing about his ties at  the  end  of  his
    time in Bermuda in terms of his employment.

17. The second point is the Applicant's family ties.  Mr  Burrett  did  not
    focus on this, no doubt because the Applicant's only ties in Sri  Lanka
    are his parents, with whom he lives. He has no  property  of  his  own.
    Those ties do not assist the Applicant.

18. Mr Burrett says that the Applicant has no ties to the UK  but  that  is
    not a point which can be given weight one way or the other in  relation
    to his intentions to go back to Sri Lanka.

19. Mr Burrett also says that if the Applicant did not have  job  prospects
    in Sri Lanka at the end of his work permit he could apply to extend  it
    but that is not a point made by the Applicant in the application.

20. The ECO was therefore entitled to rely on a lack of ties as  reason  to
    doubt the Applicant's intentions to return to Sri Lanka once  his  work
    permit has expired.

21. The submissions also focussed on the rationality of the  conclusion  as
    to genuineness of intention to return to Sri Lanka at the  end  of  the
    work  permit,  bearing  in  mind  the   Applicant's   compliance   with
    immigration control to date. The guidance provides that,  when  looking
    at the credibility of  intentions,  past  immigration  history  may  be
    relevant.

22. The Applicant has no immigration history so far as the UK is concerned.
    I have already pointed out that the US has refused a multi-entry  visit
    visa for the same reasons or essentially the same reasons as are  given
    by the ECO.

23. The reasons for the visit  visa  are  credible  in  terms  of  why  the
    Applicant needs it. The ECO however took into  account  those  reasons.
    The ECO took into account  that  the  Applicant  had  applied  for  and
    obtained a work permit in Bermuda and was seeking to  comply  with  the
    landing requirements by seeking a visit  visa  both  from  the  UK  and
    previously from the US, who had also refused it,  as  I  say  for  very
    similar reasons.

24. However, as Mr  Fracyk  points  out,  there  is  a  disconnect  between
    applying for a work permit and applying for an  immigration  visa.  The
    fact that the Applicant is seeking an immigration visa to  comply  with
    landing requirements is because he cannot do otherwise as the  Bermudan
    authorities will not accept him without one.

25. Mention is made in the Applicant's skeleton argument  of  the  Bermudan
    authorities' policy reasons behind the requirement  for  a  multi-entry
    visit visa. There is no mention of this  in  the  application  for  the
    visit visa and no evidence as to what are those reasons.  If  anything,
    as both Counsel agreed, the requirement appears designed to enable  the
    Bermudan authorities to remove a former work permit holder from Bermuda
    to a third country if that work permit holder does not leave at the end
    of that permit. Otherwise, presumably, Bermuda could not return to  the
    work permit holder's country directly  and  the  person  would  not  be
    allowed to board a plane to the UK, US or Canada without a  visa.  That
    point does not therefore assist the Applicant.

26. I agree with the Respondent's submission  that  the  issue  of  a  work
    permit by the Bermudan authorities and the sponsorship of the Applicant
    to work in Bermuda is of no material weight to the ECO's  consideration
    because those facts concern employment rather than immigration. In  any
    event, the fact of the work permit and its genuineness are  taken  into
    account by the ECO.

27. That the Applicant has no adverse immigration history does  not  assist
    him one way or the other. As Mr Fracyk  pointed  out,  were  it  to  be
    otherwise, a person applying for a visa for the first time could  never
    rationally be refused a visa. If a person has no  immigration  history,
    then the existence or lack of ties which would encourage  a  person  to
    return to his or her home country become the more important and that is
    why there is the focus by the ECO on the genuineness of  the  intention
    to return to Sri Lanka .

28. I am therefore satisfied that the ECO has had regards to factors  which
    are relevant.

29. The issue thereafter is whether the decision is one which is irrational
    to the Wednesbury standard, that is to say, whether the decision is one
    which no reasonable decision maker could reach on the  material  before
    him. Although I recognise that the impact  of  this  decision  for  the
    Applicant is harsh, that is not the test for me. It cannot be said that
    the ECO was not entitled to make the decision he did  on  the  material
    before him.

30. For those reasons I dismiss the judicial review application.

Application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

31. Mr Burrett does not make an application for permission to appeal. I  am
    required to consider that in any event. I refuse permission to  appeal.
    The is no arguable error in my decision.

Costs

32. The applicant is to pay the respondent's costs in the  sum  of  �4.500.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was given (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3(2)).
