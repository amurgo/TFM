                            DECISION AND REASONS

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Introduction

      1. In a decision sent  on  29  April  2019,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         ('FTT') dismissed the appellant's appeal against a  decision  dated
         26 September 2018, in which the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
         Department ('SSHD') refused her claim for asylum  and  humanitarian
         protection.

      2. The appellant is a citizen of Albania.  It is not disputed that she
         is a victim of trafficking ('VOT') and if returned to Albania  will
         do so as a single mother with a daughter (born in October  2016  in
         the UK).  The appellant got pregnant during the course of  enforced
         prostitution, immediately prior to her arrival in the UK.

      3. The appellant has been treated as a vulnerable  witness  throughout
         the  Tribunal  proceedings,  in  the  light  of   a   comprehensive
         psychiatric report dated 7 March 2019 which  was  before  the  FTT.
         This was prepared by a psychiatrist, Professor Katona.

Appeal to the Upper Tribunal ('UT') - error of law discussion

      4. The appellant relied upon four grounds of  appeal  but  Mr  Diwnycz
         conceded that the FTT's decision contains clear errors  of  law  in
         two inter-related respects.  First, as ground four submits,  having
         accepted Professor Katona's clinical assessment, the FTT failed  to
         adequately reason how the  appellant  could  reasonably  internally
         relocate, even with the assistance of mental health  support  in  a
         shelter  in  Tirana.   Second,  as  ground  one  submits,  the  FTT
         unlawfully concluded at [20], contrary to the country  guidance  in
         TD and AD (Trafficked women) CG [2016] UKUT 00092 (IAC),  that  the
         shelters in Tirana offer adequate systems to address the  needs  of
         all victims of trafficking, "even  for  those  in  the  appellant's
         position with serious mental health problems".

      5. Mr Diwnycz was correct to concede  these  errors  of  law  for  the
         reasons I now provide.  The relevant issues must be  considered  in
         the context of the TD country guidance,  and  I  set  out  relevant
         parts of the headnote below (my emphasis):


                 "d) In the past few years the Albanian government has  made
                 significant efforts to improve its response to trafficking.
                 This includes widening the scope of legislation, publishing
                 the  Standard   Operating   Procedures,   implementing   an
                 effective National Referral  Mechanism,  appointing  a  new
                 Anti-trafficking Co-ordinator, and  providing  training  to
                 law enforcement officials. There is in general  a  Horvath-
                 standard sufficiency of protection,  but  it  will  not  be
                 effective in every case. When considering  whether  or  not
                 there is a  sufficiency  of  protection  for  a  victim  of
                 trafficking   her   particular   circumstances   must    be
                 considered.


                 e) There is now in  place  a  reception  and  reintegration
                 programme for victims of trafficking. Returning victims  of
                 trafficking are able to stay in a shelter on  arrival,  and
                 in 'heavy cases' may be able to stay  there  for  up  to  2
                 years. During this initial period after return  victims  of
                 trafficking  are  supported  and  protected.   Unless   the
                 individual has particular vulnerabilities such as  physical
                 or mental health issues, this option  cannot  generally  be
                 said to be unreasonable; whether it is must  be  determined
                 on a case by case basis.


                 f) Once asked to leave the shelter a victim of  trafficking
                 can live on her own. In doing so she will face  significant
                 challenges  including,  but   not   limited   to,   stigma,
                 isolation, financial hardship and uncertainty, a  sense  of
                 physical insecurity and the subjective fear of being  found
                 either by their families or former traffickers. Some  women
                 will  have  the  capacity  to  negotiate  these  challenges
                 without undue hardship. There will however  be  victims  of
                 trafficking with characteristics, such as mental illness or
                 psychological scarring, for  whom  living  alone  in  these
                 circumstances would not be reasonable. Whether a particular
                 appellant falls into that category will call for a  careful
                 assessment of all the circumstances."



   6. I note that although this was not drawn to the attention of  the  FTT,
      the Country Policy and Information Note ('CPIN') on  'Albania:  people
      trafficking' dated March 2019 ('the 2019 CPIN')  confirms  at  [2.3.7]
      that notwithstanding further improvements  for  VsOT  in  Albania,  TD
      remains binding country guidance.



   7. It is therefore  clear  that  the  improving  picture  for  VsOT  from
      Albania, did not obviate an obligation on  the  part  of  the  FTT  to
      carefully consider  this  appellant's  particular  mental  health  and
      surrounding circumstances in order to  determine  whether:  (i)  there
      would be a sufficiency of protection for her in Tirana (the FTT having
      accepted at [16] that the appeal turned on internal relocation because
      the appellant cannot return to her home area); (ii) she can reasonably
      relocate to a shelter; (iii) she will have the capacity  to  negotiate
      leaving the shelter without undue hardship.  The FTT assumed that  the
      appellant's accepted serious mental  health  issues  would  not  be  a
      barrier to her accessing help given  the  systems   now  in  place  in
      Albania - see [20], [23] and [28].  That approach is erroneous in  law
      because there has been no  forensic  examination  of  the  appellant's
      particular mental health concerns  and  individual  circumstances,  as
      required by TD.


   8. The FTT has assumed that  adequate  help  would  be  provided  to  the
      appellant without her needing to pro-actively seek it, but has  failed
      to  address  significant  evidence  from  Professor  Katona  that  the
      appellant will be unable to engage with  mental  health  treatment  in
      Albania, because of her particular circumstances.  These include:  (i)
      a genuinely held subjective fear (accepted as such by  the  respondent
      at [35] of the decision letter) of being  re-trafficked,  having  been
      trafficked twice in egregious  circumstances  in  the  past  and  (ii)
      serious and overlapping mental health diagnoses that have  not  abated
      with  the  passage  of  time.   Professor  Katona  stated   that   the
      appellant's subjective fears  of  Albania  would  lead  to  a  serious
      deterioration in her mental health and she would be very  unlikely  to
      accept help because of her mistrust of the authorities.


Re-making the decision

Hearing


   9. Both representatives agreed that I should remake the decision.  It was
      agreed that the evidence before the FTT  continues  to  represent  the
      appellant's current circumstances.  To be certain about this I gave Mr
      Greer the opportunity to provide a short witness  statement  from  the
      appellant updating her  circumstances,  including  her  mental  health
      position.  She explained in this that she continues to take medication
      for depression and to help her to sleep.  She had  counselling  up  to
      April 2019 but this stopped not because her  condition  improved,  but
      because having had two years of  counselling,  the  limited  resources
      available did not permit her to have any more at  the  time.   I  then
      gave Mr Diwnycz time to  carefully  consider  this  witness  statement
      together with all the evidence before the FTT.  The UT  did  not  have
      the benefit of an Albanian interpreter.  I therefore explained  to  Mr
      Diwnycz that if he wished to cross-examine the  appellant  the  matter
      would be adjourned to enable this to take place  fairly.   Mr  Diwnycz
      confirmed that  he  did  not  dispute  the  contents  of  the  witness
      statement or any aspect of the appellant's claim.  He  confirmed  that
      he also entirely accepted Professor Katona's clinical  assessment  and
      that it remained appropriate to  assess  the  appellant's  removal  to
      Albania  at  the  date  of  hearing  by  reference  to  it.   In   the
      circumstances, he accepted the appellant's evidence and did  not  wish
      to cross-examine her.  Both parties agreed  that  the  hearing  should
      proceed by way of submissions only.



  10. Mr Diwnycz offered no additional submissions beyond relying  upon  the
      SSHD's decision letter dated 26 September 2018.  This of  course  pre-
      dates Professor Katona's report.  Mr Greer relied  upon  the  skeleton
      argument before the FTT and invited me to allow the appeal.

Issues in dispute


  11. The SSHD now accepts that the appellant cannot safely  return  to  her
      home area in Albania.  I must therefore consider  whether  she  is  at
      real risk of re-trafficking in Tirana and if not whether it  would  be
      unreasonable or unduly harsh to expect her to  avail  herself  of  the
      internal relocation alternative in Tirana.


Safety in Tirana


  12. The appellant was trafficked from Albania for the purposes  of  sexual
      exploitation by a man who pretended to  be  her  boyfriend.   She  was
      subjected to enforced prostitution and abuse  in  a  locked  room  for
      eight months.  Although this took place in 2016 the  impact  upon  the
      appellant continues to be significant.  Professor Katona has diagnosed
      her mental distress as  moderate  to  severe  and  her  trauma-related
      psychological symptoms as in  the  severe  range.   He  diagnosed  the
      appellant as having  PTSD  and  significant  depressive  symptoms.   I
      accept Professor Katona's conclusion that the appellant faces a  prima
      facie significant risk of re-trafficking and his  evidence  at  [13.8]
      that:



           "abuse renders victims  more  rather  than  less  vulnerable  to
           future abuse. The psychological damage caused  by  severe  abuse
           over-rides the sensible conscious decision-making that might  on
           first principles be thought such people might learn and apply as
           a result of their experiences.  In my clinical  opinion,  if  Ms
           [K]  were  forced  to  return  to  Albania,  she  would  be   at
           significant risk of re-trafficking."




  13. I must however consider this in the light of  the  country  background
      evidence in TD and the 2019 CPIN.  There is in general sufficiency  of
      protection for those at  risk  of  trafficking  but  it  will  not  be
      effective in every  case.   Although  Albania  has  made  considerable
      efforts to deal with trafficking, re-trafficking remains a reality.  I
      must  consider  whether  there  is  a  real  risk  of   re-trafficking
      notwithstanding  the  systems  in  place,  by  considering   all   the
      appellant's particular circumstances in the round (see headnote g)  of
      TD).  The appellant is  well  educated,  having  completed  a  nursing
      degree.  She resided in Tirana for a considerable period  and  is  not
      na�ve and unaccustomed to city life.  Yet, she was still conned  by  a
      man who pretended to be her boyfriend into a very dangerous  situation
      that led to her being trafficked.  The appellant is  no  stronger  now
      notwithstanding her age and status as a mother with a young child.  In
      fact, her mental health is such that she is far more  vulnerable  than
      when she was initially trafficked.  Although  the  appellant  and  her
      child will be able to reside in a shelter, she  is  most  unlikely  to
      seek help from anyone connected to the Albanian  authorities  for  the
      reasons  explained  by  Professor  Katona.   Having   considered   the
      appellant's circumstances in the context  of  the  country  background
      evidence, I am satisfied that she is particularly vulnerable to  being
      re-trafficked.



  14. The appellant therefore faces a real risk of persecution  for  reasons
      relating connected to her vulnerabilities, gender and past experiences
      combined. In her decision letter at [32], the SSHD accepted that  VsOT
      are a particular social group in Albania.

Internal relocation


  15. In case I am wrong about the risk of re-trafficking I have gone on  to
      address the reasonableness of internal relocation.   When  considering
      whether it will be  unduly  harsh  for  the  appellant  to  internally
      relocate to Tirana I must undertake a holistic assessment  that  takes
      into  account  the  appellant's   particular   characteristics.    The
      appellant will be returning to  Tirana  as  a  single  mother  with  a
      dependent child and no resources of her own.  As I have  noted  above,
      she is well educated, having obtained a nursing degree in Tirana,  but
      her difficulties in obtaining employment in the past together with her
      serious mental health concerns make it most unlikely that she will  be
      able to obtain employment in Tirana.  Notwithstanding the  appellant's
      personal circumstances, Mr Greer did not dispute  that  she  would  be
      able to access adequate accommodation, general support  and  education
      in a shelter in Tirana but submitted this would still be unduly  harsh
      given her mental health presentation.



  16. I accept that notwithstanding the protective mechanisms  in  place  at
      shelters in Tirana, this appellant's  already  serious  mental  health
      concerns will significantly deteriorate because of her genuinely  held
      subjective fears - see 13.5 to 13.10  of  Professor  Katona's  report.
      This appellant would be unable or unwilling to access help because her
      mental health condition is still at  a  stage  that  makes  this  very
      difficult if not impossible for her,  particularly  vis  a  vis  those
      associated with the Albanian authorities.


  17. Having considered all the country background  evidence  available,  in
      particular TD and the 2019 CPIN  and  the  clear  and  cogent  medical
      evidence from Professor Katona, I am satisfied  that  the  appellant's
      mental health  is  likely  to  significantly  deteriorate  during  the
      removal process and when placed at  a  shelter  in  Tirana.   This  is
      likely notwithstanding the protective factor provided by her child and
      any additional measures to support her during the removal process  and
      on arrival in Tirana at the shelter.  The appellant  has  a  genuinely
      enduring fear for her safety in Albania  (even  if  it  is  not  well-
      founded) which will  exacerbate  her  already  serious  mental  health
      problems, which have existed for a prolonged period of time  and  have
      not responded to anti-depressant medication or counselling in the  UK.





  18. The evidence relevant to mental health provision in the  shelters  for
      VsOT was considered in some detail in TD as follows:

           "101.      Taking all  of  the  evidence  in  the  round  we are
           satisfied that there is a basic level of healthcare provided  in
           the shelters, but that there  must  remain  concerns  about  the
           quality and extent of it, particularly  in  relation  to  mental
           health treatment. On  the  evidence  before  us,  such  care  is
           limited  to  the  prescription  of  anti-depressants  and  where
           available, counselling by  shelter  staff  who  have  no  formal
           training in psychiatry or psychology."

  19. I note that this assessment, and the guidance based  upon  it  I  have
      summarised in TD's headnote above, was based upon  evidence  available
      to the Tribunal as at a hearing date in June 2015.  However, the  SSHD
      has very recently endorsed the  headnote  relevant  to  mental  health
      provision in shelters within the 2019 CPIN - see 2.4.3-4  and  11.5.1.
      Although the facilities and support,  including  psychiatric  support,
      available in shelters has improved since the date of the hearing in TD
      and there is a trend toward more funding  and  greater  facilities  in
      shelters,  the  specific  evidence  regarding  the  psychological  and
      psychiatric support now available in shelters is still insufficient to
      prevent a deterioration in this  appellant's  mental  health.   It  is
      reasonably likely that shortly after  her  arrival  at  a  shelter  in
      Tirana, the appellant will be subject to a  mental  health  assessment
      and her needs will be identified as being serious and significant  but
      that she will not be able to access sufficient  help  to  prevent  the
      serious deterioration in her mental health as highlighted by Professor
      Katona.  I note that Mr Diwnycz made no attempt to argue otherwise.



  20. I am satisfied that notwithstanding all the evidence contained in  the
      SSHD's 2019 CPIN, this particular appellant's mental  health  concerns
      are such that, when viewed  as  part  of  her  overall  circumstances,
      internal relocation to a shelter in Tirana  will  be  unreasonable  or
      unduly harsh.

Decision

  21. I remake the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal on asylum and
      human rights grounds.
