For the Respondent:    Ms A Vatish, Counsel instructed by Hilcrest
Solicitors LLP


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, who of course was the respondent before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, has been granted permission to appeal against the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Cockrill who, by  a  determination  dated  20
    August 2014,  allowed  the  respondent's  appeal  against  the  removal
    decision that accompanied refusal of her asylum and human rights claim.
     For convenience of expression I shall refer to the respondent  as  the
    claimant.

2.   The claimant, who was born on 16 May 1988, is a  citizen  of  Pakistan.
    She arrived in the United Kingdom in April 2012 and was admitted  as  a
    visitor.  Her application for that visa had been refused by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer but she and her brother, who  had  also  applied  for
    entry clearance,  successfully  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    persuading the judge that  a  brief  family  visit  was  all  that  was
    genuinely intended.  However,  she  overstayed  that  leave  and  on  7
    January 2014 claimed asylum.

3.   A detailed account of the asylum claim is set out in the  Secretary  of
    State's refusal letter but  for  present  purposes  the  claim  can  be
    summarised as follows.  The claimant, who had never worked in  Pakistan
    but had been in education up to the age of 20, lived with  her  parents
    and one of her brothers who managed the family  business  which  was  a
    fruit farm.  She said that her father had always been  violent  towards
    her and had never let her leave the  house.   In  2012  the  claimant's
    father told her that he had arranged for her engagement to  a  60  year
    old man whom she had never met.  The claimant told her mother that  she
    had no wish for such a match and so her mother contacted the claimant's
    cousin who lived in London and made arrangements for the visit that the
    claimant and her brother subsequently were able to make to  the  United
    Kingdom.  The claimant said that if she returned to Pakistan her father
    would force her into this unwanted marriage or may kill her  and  there
    was no sufficiency of protection available from the  authorities.   The
    claimant said that she did not claim asylum immediately upon arrival in
    the United Kingdom because she was scared and because she was not aware
    of the process for doing so.

4.   The Secretary of State refused the application because for the  reasons
    that are set out in a lengthy and detailed refusal letter she  did  not
    believe to be true any part of the claimant's  account  of  facing  the
    prospect of being forced into a marriage against her wishes.

5.   In his determination the judge  summarised  the  Secretary  of  State's
    case.  It was not accepted that the claimant's father had been  violent
    towards her, a number of credibility points  had  been  raised  in  the
    refusal letter and it was not  accepted  that  the  claimant  would  be
    forced into an unwanted marriage upon  her  return  to  Pakistan.   The
    Secretary of State pointed to the claimant's failure  to  claim  asylum
    earlier and in any event contended that  there  was  a  sufficiency  of
    protection available from the authorities should she need it.  Finally,
    the Secretary of State said there were shelters available for a  person
    facing difficulties of the type claimed by this claimant.

6.   Having heard oral evidence from  the  complainant  the  judge  received
    submissions from both representatives.  He summarised  the  submissions
    advanced on behalf of the Secretary of State at  paragraph  30  of  his
    determination as follows:

         "I heard a submission from Mr Hewertson; he relied upon  the  terms
         of the refusal letter, arguing that it was a  comprehensive  letter
         setting out fully the respondent's case.  It was  highlighted  that
         really  the  crux  of  the  appeal  related  to   the   appellant's
         credibility and reference was made to the various  challenges  that
         were raised in the course of the refusal letter."

    From that observation made by the judge  in  the  determination  it  is
    unambiguously clear that  the  credibility  challenges  raised  in  the
    refusal letter  were  at  large  and  in  play  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

7.   The  findings  of  the  judge  are  set  out  in  the  section  of  the
    determination beginning at paragraph 33.  As Ms Vatish, who appears for
    the respondent today, has made clear, the  judge  recognised  that  the
    central issue to be resolved was  the  credibility  of  the  claimant's
    account.  The judge said that it was  conspicuous  that  there  was  no
    evidence offered by the claimant's brother or cousin both of whom  were
    in the United Kingdom and might be thought well-placed to  support  the
    account advanced by the claimant.

8.   The judge then said:

         "All in all then there is not a lot of  confirmation  of  what  the
         appellant has been saying from any relative  in  this  country  and
         that is perhaps rather surprising and unusual."

9.   Despite that the judge accepted the claimant's  evidence  and  accepted
    to be true all that she said about her father's intention to force  her
    into an unwanted marriage saying:

         "I have reached that fundamental conclusion because looking at the
         matter  overall  I  do  consider  that  the  appellant  is   indeed
         credible".

     That is the point made by Ms Vatish in her submissions this  afternoon.
     The judge, in her submission,  was  taking  a  holistic  view  of  the
    evidence before him in reaching his conclusion  on  the  basis  of  his
    assessment of the evidence as a whole.

10.  The difficulty with that argument is that although the judge was  aware
    and had made clear that he was aware that reliance was  placed  by  the
    Secretary of State upon the  credibility  challenges  set  out  in  the
    refusal letter there is nothing at all in the determination to  suggest
    that the judge had had any regard to those challenges.

11.  The question to be addressed therefore is whether  his  failure  to  do
    so, and I am quite satisfied that he did fail to do so, was or may have
    been material to the outcome.

12.  The Secretary of State  has  raised  a  number  of  challenges  to  the
    claimant's credibility that were legitimately raised and required to be
    considered and resolved by the judge including the following:

    (a)  Although the claimant said that she and her siblings had  suffered
         years of abuse from her father there had been no attempt to  leave.
         Given that she has three adult brothers it is reasonable to expect,
         said the respondent, that they would have been willing to assist in
         that regard, especially as two of  those  brothers  had  themselves
         decided to leave home.


    (b)  The account given by the claimant of her freedom being  restricted
         was inconsistent and contradictory.  She said both that she was not
         allowed to leave the family home and that she had  attended  school
         until the age of 20 to complete her education.


    (c)  Given the account of her  father  being  violent  and  controlling
         towards members of the family it was not said to be  credible  that
         the claimant's mother  would  have  arranged  a  marriage  for  the
         claimant's sister without his permission and it was  not  credible.
         according to the respondent. that he would have allowed that sister
         to leave the country.


    (d)  The claimant said that her unwanted engagement was  arranged  some
         considerable time before she left Pakistan and yet the marriage had
         not taken place.  If her father had decided that she  should  marry
         the man of his choice it was said  by  the  respondent  not  to  be
         credible  that  financial  constraints  would  have  prevented  the
         marriage from taking place.


    (e)  It was said not to be credible if such an engagement had  been  in
         place for so  long  that  the  claimant's  fiancï¿½  would  not  have
         arranged to meet her before she left Pakistan.


    (f)  The Secretary of State argued that there was a lack of credibility
         in the account of documents from the  United  Kingdom  required  in
         respect of the visa application that was  being  made  without  her
         father's knowledge being delivered by hand otherwise  than  in  the
         usual way by the Post Office to the family home.


    (g)  In any event the claimant gave a  contradictory  and  inconsistent
         account according to the respondent of  how  these  documents  were
         delivered to her.


    (h)  The Secretary of State said that it would stretch credulity beyond
         its limit that by coincidence a number of events came  together  to
         facilitate the claimant's plans.

13.  It may be of course that there was a complete answer to each  of  those
    concerns but those were issues that were relied upon by  one  party  to
    the proceedings, had been specifically raised before the judge and were
    issues that the judge was obliged to engage with.  As I  have  observed
    there is nothing in the determination to indicate that  the  judge  did
    take those matters into account or that he resolved them.  If he did so
    then it is impossible to know from the determination for  what  reasons
    he rejected them.

  14. Therefore, in either event an error of law is disclosed on  the  basis
      that either the judge failed to have regard to material considerations
      or he  failed  to  give  anything  approaching  adequate  reasons  for
      rejecting the case advanced and relied upon by the Secretary of State.
       That is sufficient to establish that the decision of the judge cannot
      stand.  The determination will be set aside other than as a record  of
      what was said at the hearing and the appeal will be  remitted  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal to be determined afresh by a  different  judge  of
      that Tribunal.


   Summary of decision


  15. The First-tier Tribunal made an error of law and the determination  of
      Judge Cockrill is set aside.


  16. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  determined
      afresh by a different judge of that tribunal.
