                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Miss L Irvine, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals  against  a  decision  by  Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Murray, promulgated on 28 August  2017,  dismissing  his
    appeal on all grounds.

 2. Without conceding all the detailed grounds of  challenge,  Mr  Matthews
    accepted that the judge went wrong in relying on  the  age  assessment,
    although  she  had  acknowledged  earlier  in  her  decision  that  the
    assessment had been discarded by the local  authority  which  made  it;
    that a finding on age was needed;  and  that  this  impacted  upon  the
    article 8 outcome.

 3. Although that appeared to be the only substantial issue  of  fact,  the
    appellant preferred the outcome to be a  remit  to  the  FtT,  and  the
    respondent did not oppose that course.

 4. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.  The case is remitted to the  FtT  for  a
    fresh hearing.

 5. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Murray.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
