                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                  MISS S M
                                                                  Respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    I refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.  A
      judge of the Upper Tribunal has found  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      erred in law in allowing this appellant's appeal and the decision  has
      been set aside. A further hearing is listed for 3 September 2014.

2.    The Upper Tribunal has received a letter from the appellant, dated  21
      August 2014, stating that she wishes to withdraw  the  appeal  because
      she has been granted indefinite leave to remain.

3.    On the  assumption  that  the  appellant  has  in  fact  been  granted
      indefinite leave to remain, the appeal before the  Upper  Tribunal  is
      abandoned pursuant to section 104(4A) of the Nationality,  Immigration
      and Asylum Act 2002.
