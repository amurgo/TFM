                       UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE RIMINGTON


                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                                  Piero [A]
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION and REASONS

    1. I have taken into account the Pilot Practice  Direction:  Contingency
       arrangements in the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper  Tribunal  2020
       and the Presidential Guidance Note No. 1 2020.

    2. The Tribunal may pursuant to Rules 34 of The Tribunal Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as amended) ("the Upper Tribunal
       Procedure Rules") make decisions in appeals without a hearing. The
       Upper Tribunal gave the provisional direction owing to the Covid-19
       pandemic that the decision on the error of law in this matter could
       be determined on the papers and invited submissions from both
       parties. There has been no response from the parties.

    3. I bear in mind the principles established  in  Osborn  v  The  Parole
       Board [2013] UKSC 61.  I have  concluded  that  the  matter  although
       complex factually does not require, in the interests of  justice  and
       fairness, a hearing to determine the matters on the error of law.

    4. The appellant's appeal against  deportation  was  allowed  under  the
       Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Shimmin on 23rd December 2019.

    5. Permission to appeal was granted to the Secretary  of  State  on  the
       basis that Mr [A] was not entitled to the highest level of protection
       because he had not shown he had exercised treaty  rights  during  the
       relevant period and because the judge had not considered whether  his
       integrative links had been broken by his imprisonment on 18th October
       2018.

    6.  At  paragraph  32  of  the  decision  Judge  Shimmin  set  out   the
       documentation (predominantly dated between 2006 and 2015) provided by
       the Appellant and stated as follows:

           'This documentation has not been challenged by  the  respondent.
           On the basis of the this documentation and  the  other  evidence
           before me I am satisfied on the balance  of  probabilities  that
           the appellant has  been  continuously  resident  in  the  United
           Kingdom for 10 years prior to  his  imprisonment  in  accordance
           with the EEA Regulations  2016.   Hence  I  find  the  appellant
           qualified  for  the  enhanced  protection  of  Regulation  27(4)
           relating to imperative grounds of public security'.

    7. As set out in the application for permission to appeal the appellant,
       born in 1996, is a repeat offender and  on  7th  September  2018  was
       convicted of a sexual assault on a female and sentenced to 2 years in
       prison with a sex offenders notice of 10 years.  On 23rd October 2018
       he was convicted of possessing a Class A drug and a Class B drug  and
       sentenced to 4 weeks imprisonment.  The  deportation  decision  (from
       which the 10 years residence should be counted backwards) was made on
       16th January 2019.

    8. The grounds assert that the judge merely calculated a linear ten year
       period, did not engage with the supplementary letter dated 6th  March
       2019 from the Secretary of State as  to  why  the  highest  level  of
       protection did not apply and failed to  take  a  proper  approach  to
       rehabilitation in the light of MC (Essa Principles  recast)  Portugal
       [2015] UKUT 50.  In relation to the assessment of the enhanced  level
       of protection, the relevant authorities have been set out in Terzaghi
       v SSHD  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  2017  and  the  principles  summarized  at
       paragraph 12 of that judgment.

    9. I find that the judge failed to grapple with the relevant authorities
       in relation to integration of the  appellant  in  the  light  of  his
       criminal  offending.    It  is  important  to  consider  whether  the
       integration has been broken.  The appellant's mere residence may have
       been broken even if he  had  during  the  relevant  period  exercised
       treaty  rights  (which  is  not  clear).    The   absence   of   that
       consideration is a  material  error  of  law  which  strikes  at  the
       fundamental basis of the legal  underpinning  of  the  decision.   As
       pointed out in the grounds of appeal the judge did  not  consider  FV
       (Italy) (Cases C-424/16 and C-316/16) which confirmed that  permanent
       residence was a requirement to enjoy enhanced protection, contrary to
       Vomero [2016] UKSC 49.

   10. Nor has the judge conducted an assessment further to Regulation 27(8)
       of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2016  which
       requires regard to be had to the considerations contained in Schedule
       1  (considerations  of  public  policy,  public  security   and   the
       fundamental interests of society).  Although Schedule 1 is set out in
       the decision, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 considerations do not  appear  to
       have been applied.




       Notice

   11. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified.  I  set  aside
       the decision pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals Courts and
       Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing  in  mind  the  nature  and
       extent of the findings to be made the matter should  be  remitted  to
       the First-tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the  TCE  2007
       and further to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.
