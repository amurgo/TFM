    Representation:
          For the Appellant: the appellant did not appear and was not
represented
          For the Respondent: Mr C Avery a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on  20  July  1984.
      She has been given permission to appeal the  determination  of  First-
      Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rose  who  dismissed  her  appeal  against  the
      respondent's decision of 24 April 2012 to refuse her  entry  clearance
      to the United Kingdom as a family  visitor  under  the  provisions  of
      Paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.


   2. The respondent refused the application on the basis that the appellant
      had not submitted evidence that her company was operational or of  the
      income she derived from it. Her claimed circumstances in Nigeria  were
      doubted  and  it  was  considered  that  she  had  not  established  a
      sufficient incentive to leave the UK at the end of the proposed visit.
      Her  estimated  funds  of  �200  would  not  be  sufficient  even   if
      accommodation was provided by the sponsor, her  cousin.  She  had  not
      shown that she would be maintained and accommodated in the UK  without
      working or having recourse to public funds. The refusal was made under
      subparagraphs (i), (ii), (vi) and (vii) of Paragraph 41.


   3. The decision was  reviewed  and  maintained  by  the  Entry  Clearance
      Manager. The appellant appealed. The judge  heard  her  appeal  on  15
      March 2013. The appellant was represented but the respondent was  not.
      The appellant's sponsor attended the hearing and gave evidence.


   4. The judge found that the appellant had not provided a reliable account
      of  her  intentions.  There  was  a  dearth  of  relevant  documentary
      evidence. She had not shown that she met the requirements of Paragraph
      41, specifically subparagraphs (i), (ii), (vi) and (vii). He dismissed
      the appeal.


   5. The appellant applied for and was granted permission  to  appeal.  The
      First-Tier Tribunal Judge who granted  permission  to  appeal  thought
      that the grounds had little merit except for the allegation  that  the
      judge  erred  in  law  in  addressing  the  question  of  adequacy  of
      accommodation when this was  not  raised  by  the  respondent  in  the
      reasons for refusal. I conclude that there is some  ambiguity  in  the
      last paragraph which states; "7. That ground is  arguable.  Permission
      is granted." I will treat this is a grant of permission in respect  of
      all the grounds.


   6. This appeal was listed before me at 10 am. By 11:10 am  there  was  no
      attendance by  the  sponsor  or  the  appellant's  solicitors  and  no
      communication from anyone. I am satisfied that the required notice  of
      the hearing has been given to the appellant's solicitors. They are the
      solicitors on the record for the appellant and her address is given as
      care of them. They submitted the application for permission to  appeal
      and there is no indication that  they  have  ceased  to  act  for  the
      appellant.


   7. I proceeded with the hearing in the absence of the appellant because I
      was satisfied that she had been notified of the hearing  and  that  it
      was in the interests of justice to do so. I note that there is a  Rule
      24 letter from the respondent dated 29 April 2013 which  submits  that
      the judge directed himself appropriately.


   8. Mr Avery submitted that, in relation to the one ground thought to have
      some merit, the respondent had raised the issues of  both  maintenance
      and accommodation in the refusal letter. He argued that there  was  no
      error of law and I was asked to uphold the  decision.  I  reserved  my
      determination.


   9. I can find no-fault or error of law with the ground which alleges that
      because, in paragraph 12 of the determination, the judge records  that
      the sponsor "was not asked to provide any evidence as to any knowledge
      that she might have had about the  appellant's  business",  he  should
      have raised the point either with the appellant's representative or by
      questioning the sponsor. It is clear from the same paragraph that  the
      appellant's representative was aware of and addressed all the  reasons
      for refusal. These included the lack of evidence that the  appellant's
      company was operational or of the income she claimed  to  derive  from
      it. There is no indication that the appellant was anything other  than
      competently  legally  represented.  The  issues  were  clear  and  the
      representative  was  well  aware  of  them.   It   would   have   been
      inappropriate for the judge to cross examine the sponsor.


  10. I assume that the grounds which refer to the copies of the appellant's
      bank statements as "ineligible" must mean "illegible" which, from  the
      copies before me, is the case. I can find no-fault  with  the  judge's
      decision to consider later and  better  quality  copies  of  the  bank
      statements. The point the judge takes in paragraph 14 relates  to  why
      the appellant supplied a bank statement for a period ending 11  months
      earlier and has nothing to do with the replacement of  illegible  bank
      statements with legible ones.


  11. The judge's reasoning in paragraph 16 of the determination  does  not,
      as the grounds allege, amount to a rewriting of  the  refusal  letter.
      The respondent took the view that "you have  (not)  properly  budgeted
      for your trip or that if you did so it would be  reasonable  to  spend
      the majority of your funds on a short trip to the UK given you have  a
      child to  support."  This  is  the  issue  which  the  judge  properly
      addressed in this paragraph. Although it is not raised in the  grounds
      I note that the judge  did  not  fall  into  the  same  error  as  the
      respondent. He concluded that the appellant was saying  that  she  had
      �2000 available for her trip, not �200.


  12. The last of the grounds of appeal argues that  the  judge  should  not
      have addressed the issue of accommodation when this was  not  a  point
      raised by the respondent. That is factually incorrect. In the  refusal
      letter  the  respondent  said;   "Therefore,   on   the   balance   of
      probabilities, I am not satisfied that  you  will  be  maintained  and
      accommodated in the UK without working or having  recourse  to  public
      funds or that you are able to meet the cost of  return  or  an  onward
      journey as required by paragraph 41 (vi) and (vii)  of  HC  395."  The
      judge's statement in paragraph 18  that  there  was  no  accommodation
      report was made in the context of the rest of that paragraph in  which
      he addressed the sponsor's circumstances.


  13. I find that the judge reached conclusions open to him on the evidence.
      There is no error of law and I uphold his determination.
