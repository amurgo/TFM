For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   Following an error of law hearing at Field  House  on  29  May  2014  I
    decided that the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Troup,  allowing
    the appeal on Article 8 grounds, following a hearing in Newport  on  13
    February 2014, had to be set aside.  My reasons were  set  out  in  the
    following error of law decision and directions, sent to the parties  on
    7 July 2014.

             ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


             1.   This is an appeal that was  allowed  at  the  First-tier.
             The appellant before  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  therefore  the
             Secretary of State.  For clarity and convenience,  however,  I
             will refer to the parties as  they  were  for  the  First-tier
             appeal.


             2.   The appellant, a citizen of the Philippines,  studied  in
             the UK between 2008 and 2010, and was  then  given  leave  for
             post-study work (Tier 1) between November 2010 and 8 November
             2012.  Before  the  expiry  of  this  leave  she  applied  for
             indefinite leave to  remain  on  human  rights  grounds.   The
             factual history is complex.  The application was initially put
             forward on grounds that had altered by the time of the appeal,
             and had altered again by the time of the hearing.


             3.   The judge heard  evidence  from  the  appellant  and  her
             British fianc�.  The judge found that the appellant could  not
             succeed under the Immigration Rules, but he allowed the appeal
             on Article 8 grounds,  with  reference  to  the  principle  in
             Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.  The judge found that it  was
             disproportionate, and not in the public interest,  to  require
             the appellant to return to  the  Philippines  solely  for  the
             purpose of making an entry clearance application.


             4.   The grounds seeking permission to appeal referred to  the
             cases of Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) and Nagre [2013] EWHC
             720 (Admin).   The  complaint  was  that  the  judge  had  not
             identified any compelling circumstances which would render the
             appellant's removal unjustifiably harsh.  The facts  could  be
             distinguished from Chikwamba because neither party had refugee
             status preventing family life  from  continuing  abroad.   The
             judge had no regard to the income  threshold  requirements  of
             the Immigration Rules.


             5.   Permission to appeal was granted by Judge  Pooler  on  14
             April 2014.  The judge granting  permission  to  appeal  noted
             that no reference had been made to the  principles  considered
             in Gulshan, and the judge could therefore arguably  have  been
             said to have undertaken the type of  free-wheeling  Article  8
             analysis, unencumbered by the Rules, which was  said  in  that
             case not to be the correct approach.


             6.   During the error of  law  hearing  I  raised,  with  both
             parties, an additional point.  The judge, at paragraph  26  of
             the determination, had ended his consideration of whether  the
             appellant  could  comply  with   the   requirements   of   the
             Immigration Rules with the  observation  that  she  could  not
             succeed as a fianc�e or  spouse,  because  she  had  no  entry
             clearance.  The  point  that  had  not  been  considered,  and
             appears not to have been raised,  was  whether  the  appellant
             could nevertheless succeed under Appendix FM, through reliance
             on the exception (EX1), bearing in mind that reliance  on  the
             exception was not prohibited by the appellant having  been  in
             the UK as a visitor, or with a shorter period  of  leave.   In
             order to succeed under the exception the appellant would  have
             had  to  show  that  she  was  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a partner who  was  in  the  UK  and  was  a
             British citizen, and that there were insurmountable  obstacles
             to family life with that partner continuing outside the UK.


             7.   After an opportunity for the  parties  to  consider  this
             additional issue the representatives made  submissions,  which
             can be summarised as follows.


             8.    Mr  Tarlow,  for  the  respondent,  submitted  that  the
             insurmountable obstacles test was not  to  be  regarded  as  a
             literal one, but nevertheless  it  was  a  high  test,  and  a
             difficult one to meet.  There was nothing to  show  that  this
             appellant could come over that threshold.  The judge  had  not
             been required to deal with the point since  it  had  not  been
             raised before him.  The appellant was legally represented, and
             this was not a Robinson obvious point.


             9.    Ms  Bexson,  for  the  appellant,  accepted   that   the
             appellant's representatives had  not  raised  the  point,  but
             submitted that it should nevertheless  have  been  considered.
             There had been lots of  evidence  relevant  to  the  issue  of
             insurmountable obstacles.  The appellant's partner  could  not
             leave his job or his parents.  The couple were in the  process
             of trying for a family.


             Error of Law Decision


             10.  Having considered the matter  I  have  decided  that  the
             judge did err in law in a  manner  material  to  the  outcome.
             Although the current state of the law on Article 8 is far from
             clear,  with  arguable  conflicts  between  decisions  of  the
             Supreme Court, in Patel, and those of the Upper  Tribunal  and
             High Court in Gulshan and Nagre, nevertheless the structure of
             any consideration of Article 8 is clear to the extent  that  a
             full  examination  of  whether  an  appellant  can  meet   the
             requirements of  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph  276ADE  is  now
             required.  It is also true that the case law  of  Gulshan  and
             Nagre requires consideration by a judge who allows  an  appeal
             on Article 8 grounds, having decided that the requirements  of
             the Immigration Rules are not  met.   It  may  be  that  there
             remain legal arguments as to whether Gulshan and Nagre can  be
             said to have changed the law set out  in  Huang,  Razgar,  and
             most recently, Patel, but I accept that a  judge  allowing  an
             appeal on Article 8 grounds in these circumstances can be said
             to have erred in law by not considering Gulshan and Nagre.


             11.  On this basis I have decided that  the  judge's  decision
             allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds must be set aside.


             12.  The normal position in such appeals  would  be  that  the
             Article 8 aspect would need to be remade, but not  that  under
             the Immigration Rules.  As became clear  during  the  hearing,
             however, this appeal is somewhat different.  It appears to  me
             that the judge's finding that the appellant could not meet the
             requirements of Appendix FM cannot be  preserved,  because  no
             consideration was given to EX1.   In  remaking  the  decision,
             therefore, it will be necessary for  the  parties  to  address
             Appendix FM first, with particular reference  to  EX1,  before
             making submissions on Article 8.


             13.  The parties both agreed that it would be appropriate  for
             any remaking to be conducted in the Upper  Tribunal,  although
             Ms Bexson had no objection to a remittal.  I  have  considered
             the Practice Direction, and noted that the  normal  course  is
             for decisions to be remade in the Upper Tribunal.  I note that
             the facts are not disputed.   For  the  most  part  the  issue
             involves the application of the law to those  facts,  although
             there may be  some  matters  relevant  to  the  insurmountable
             obstacles point on  which  limited  further  evidence  may  be
             appropriate.  Given  the  agreement  of  the  parties  I  will
             therefore remake the decision at a resumed hearing.


             Decision


             14.  My decision is that there was a  material  error  of  law
             disclosed by  the  determination,  and  the  judge's  decision
             allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds is  set  aside.   The
             decision will be remade following a  resumed  hearing  in  the
             Upper Tribunal.

The Hearing

2.   At the start of the hearing there was a discussion of the  issues.   It
    was agreed that the first issue  was  whether  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements in the exception in Appendix FM.   It  was  agreed  by  Ms
    Bexson, for the appellant, that it would  only  be  necessary  to  give
    consideration to Article 8 if I found in the respondent's favour on the
    Appendix FM exception point.

3.   There was a brief discussion of whether  the  insurmountable  obstacles
    test in the exception should be approached on the  basis  that  it  was
    concerned with permanent relocation of the couple outside  the  UK,  or
    whether it could be concerned  with  a  temporary  relocation  for  the
    purposes of entry clearance.  For the purposes of this  appeal  it  was
    agreed between the parties that the insurmountable obstacles  test  was
    concerned with the question of permanent relocation, rather  than  with
    entry clearance.

4.   It was also agreed between the parties, following  my  introduction  of
    the potential relevance of changes to  Appendix  FM  on  28  July  2014
    brought about by HC 532, that those changes  would  be  considered  and
    addressed in submissions.  Neither side had prepared the point,  but  I
    provided the new definition of insurmountable obstacles  inserted  into
    the Rules as EX.2.  Without  having  prepared  the  point  the  parties
    agreed to proceed on the  basis  that  they  would  refer  to  the  new
    definition.  Ms Bexson, for the  appellant,  had  no  objection  to  me
    taking that definition into account, whether or not  the  changes  were
    applicable to the current appeal.

5.   The appellant and her husband both gave evidence  at  the  hearing  and
    were cross-examined.

6.   For the remaking hearing the appellant's representatives  had  prepared
    an additional bundle of documents (25 pages).  This  included  a  joint
    letter from the appellant and  her  husband,  and  various  letters  of
    support, including a joint letter from the appellant's  parents-in-law.
    There was also medical evidence about the  appellant's  parents-in-law,
    and a  letter  from  a  Catholic  priest  of  the  Oratory  in  London,
    confirming that the couple were to have their  marriage  blessed  at  a
    service due to take place  on  20  September  2014.   The  bundle  also
    contained  various  financial  documents,   including   tax   documents
    confirming the appellant's husband's income for the tax year to 5 April
    2014, which was just short of �34,000.  Various utility bills in  joint
    names, or in the appellant's name, were also provided to establish that
    the couple  were  living  together  at  their  home  in  Croydon.   The
    appellant's husband's job is as an English  teacher  at  a  sixth  form
    college in Croydon.

7.   The evidence of the appellant  and  her  husband  at  the  hearing  was
    concerned with  the  issue  of  whether  they  could  relocate  to  the
    Philippines.  The main reasons that they  both  put  forward  for  this
    being very difficult were the appellant's husband's job and career, his
    responsibility as an only child to his elderly parents, the appellant's
    conflicts with relatives in the Philippines, including threats from her
    uncle, and the desire of the couple to start a family  in  the  future,
    and for this to be in the UK.

8.   There were no credibility challenges in relation  either  to  the  oral
    evidence or any of  the  documentary  evidence.   Mr  Walker,  for  the
    respondent, accepted the difficulties put forward,  with  reference  to
    the appellant's parents-in-law and their health difficulties, and  with
    reference to the appellant's husband's career.  He made  no  submission
    that the couple could not meet the insurmountable obstacles  test.   Ms
    Bexson,  for  the  appellant,  referred  to  the  new   definition   of
    insurmountable obstacles introduced by HC 532.  The appellant  and  her
    partner would face very significant difficulties, and these  could  not
    be overcome, or would entail very serious hardship for the appellant or
    her partner.

Decision and Reasons

9.   In remaking the appeal I have decided  that  it  falls  to  be  allowed
    under the  Immigration  Rules,  with  reference  to  the  exception  in
    Appendix FM.

10.  With reference to EX.1(b) there is no dispute in  this  case  that  the
    appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner  who
    is in the UK and is a British citizen.  The couple are married, and are
    living  together.   The  remaining   issue   is   whether   there   are
    "insurmountable obstacles to family life with that  partner  continuing
    outside the UK."  As was in  effect  acknowledged  at  the  hearing  it
    appears to me clear that there are such insurmountable obstacles.

11.  The definition of insurmountable obstacles provided by HC 532  may  not
    apply directly to the current appeal, because the application  predated
    it, but following the agreement of  the  parties  I  have  nevertheless
    considered it.  It is likely that the Secretary of State had this  view
    of the insurmountable obstacles test before HC 532 was  produced.   The
    new definition may therefore be of some use  in  filling  the  relative
    vacuum that previously existed as to how the test should be approached.
     With reference to the definition I accept the submission made  on  the
    appellant's  behalf  that  the  couple  would  face  very   significant
    difficulties  in  continuing  family  life  outside  the   UK.    These
    difficulties are primarily  concerned  with  the  appellant's  husband.
    Although he has travelled and worked abroad in  the  past  he  has  now
    obtained a permanent position of some responsibility, and clearly wants
    to continue with that employment, and to develop his career.  Having to
    abandon it would clearly be a matter amounting to  a  very  significant
    difficulty, that would entail very serious hardship for  him,  and  for
    the appellant.  The potential relocation would deprive  the  couple  of
    their source of income.

12.  In addition the appellant's parents-in-law, who are now 72 and 80,  and
    have various health problems, now rely  to  a  considerable  extent  on
    their son, and also on the appellant.  Forcing the appellant's  husband
    to leave the UK and abandon his parents, or  facing  a  very  difficult
    choice about either abandoning them or being separated from  his  wife,
    would also amount to very serious hardship.

13.  For these reasons I have decided,  on  the  particular  facts  in  this
    appeal, that the appellant does meet the insurmountable obstacles  test
    in EX.1(b).

14.  It has not been suggested that there are any other aspects of  Appendix
    FM that she cannot meet.

15.  Although this was not raised at the hearing  by  either  party  I  have
    taken note of the fact that section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014 came
    into force on 28 July  2014,  and  that  it  amended  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, inserting a new part 5A into that Act.
     In reaching the above decision I have  taken  account  of  the  public
    interest factors at 117B.  I note that none of the factors would appear
    to  count  against  the  appellant.   The  maintenance   of   effective
    immigration controls is in the public interest, but  if  the  appellant
    meets the requirements of the respondent's own Immigration Rules, as  I
    have found, then this is not an adverse point.   The  appellant  speaks
    English; the couple are financially independent;  and  the  only  other
    point is about her  immigration  history,  but  this  again  is  to  be
    assessed in the context of the fact that she meets the requirements  of
    the Rules.

16.  As I understand it the consequence of  the  appellant  succeeding  only
    under EX.1, despite the fact that  the  couple  can  meet  the  income,
    English  language,  and  all  other  requirements  (apart  from   entry
    clearance) is that the appellant would be placed on a ten year route to
    settlement, with chargeable applications to be made at two and  a  half
    year intervals.  As I suggested at the end of the hearing the appellant
    and her husband may wish to seek advice on the  best  way  to  proceed.
    Once the first period of leave is given there  may  be  options,  given
    that the financial and other requirements  are  met,  for  a  potential
    transfer to a shorter route to settlement.  This issue was not explored
    in any detail, but I repeat the suggestion that the  matter  should  be
    given consideration, and the appellant and her  husband  should  obtain
    advice on the point.

17.  It was not suggested that there was any  need  for  anonymity  in  this
    appeal, and I make no such order.  The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  made
    no fee award, because the case presented at appeal differed  from  that
    made in the initial application.  No submissions were made  as  to  fee
    award.  Despite having allowed the appeal I have decided to follow  the
    same course as the First-tier  Judge,  for  the  same  reasons,  and  I
    therefore make no fee award in this case.

18.  In accordance with the agreement at the  hearing,  having  reached  the
    conclusion above in relation to the Immigration Rules, I have not  gone
    on to consider Article 8.

Decision

19.  The Secretary of State's appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  allowed.
    Having set aside the decision allowing the appeal on Article 8  grounds
    the decision is remade as follows.

20.  The appellant's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's  decision  is
    allowed under the Immigration Rules, with reference to the exception in
    Appendix FM.
