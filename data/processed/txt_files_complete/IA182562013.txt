                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan whose appeal  was  dismissed  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Hembrough in a determination  promulgated  on
    27th January 2014.  The judge also said that the decision to refuse the
    application with reference to paragraph 245ZX(d) and paragraph 1A(h) of
    Appendix C to the Rules was not in accordance with the law.

 2. Grounds of application were lodged and permission to  appeal  initially
    refused but on renewal of the application for permission to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Clive Lane.   He
    said it was arguable that the judge, having found that the  immigration
    decision was not in accordance with the law erred in law by  dismissing
    the appeal for reasons not arising from the decision without giving the
    Appellant a proper opportunity to respond.  In  addition,  the  judge's
    comments at paragraphs 25 to 26 were arguably unwise; it was not  clear
    what influence those comments had upon the outcome of the appeal.

 3. A Rule 24 notice was lodged indicating that the judge  was  correct  to
    dismiss the appeal, although he  should  have  done  so  for  different
    reasons, namely that the Appellant did not provide  any  new  financial
    evidence showing maintenance for a 28 day period preceding the date  of
    the variation of his application - reference was made to Qureshi (Tier
    4 - effect of variation - App C) Pakistan [2011]  UKUT  00412  (IAC).
    Thus the matter came before me on the above date.

 4. It is helpful to set out the factual background to this appeal.

 5. The application was first submitted on 12th June  2012,  along  with  a
    Confirmation of Acceptance  for  Studies  ("CAS")  for  a  postgraduate
    diploma in hospitality and  tourism  management  at  Shepherd  Business
    School Limited.  Since the application was submitted  the  Home  Office
    revoked the  Tier  4  licence  of  Shepherd  Business  School  and  the
    Appellant was given a sixty day window within  which  consideration  of
    his application would be suspended.

 6. On 9th March 2013 the Appellant was assigned a CAS by Mancunia  College
    to pursue a level 7 diploma in healthcare management.

 7. On 18th March 2013  the  Home  Office  refused  the  application.   The
    Appellant was awarded 30 points for  possession  of  a  valid  CAS  but
    denied 10 points for maintenance as he was required to  submit  a  bank
    statement dated within 31 days of 9th March 2013, the date  his  second
    CAS was assigned and he had not done so.

 8. The skeleton argument for the Appellant sets out the material  findings
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The grounds then go  on  to  mention
    Patel (revocation of sponsor licence - fairness) India [2011] UKUT 211
    (IAC) where it was said that in circumstances where the  applicant  was
    innocent of the practice that led to loss  of  sponsorship  status  and
    ignorant of the fact of that loss, common  law  fairness  required  the
    Home  Office  to  afford  them  an  equal  opportunity  to   vary   the
    application.

 9. As such the proper disposal in a case of this type would be  simply  to
    find that the decision was not in accordance with  the  law.   On  that
    basis no lawful decision could be regarded as having been made and  the
    application remains to be determined by the Home Office.  Ground  1  of
    the Grounds of application states that  the  judge  erred  in  that  he
    considered the Appellant's situation at the date of the hearing, rather
    than the date of application.  The second  ground  is  that  the  judge
    erred in his application of the principles deriving from Patel and made
    findings of fact that were not properly open to  him.   The  judge  had
    failed to apply the factors in  Patel.   In  particular  when  Mancunia
    College closed down it could hardly be said that the Appellant had  not
    been a bona fide student there.  There was no suggestion  that  he  was
    not a bona fide student at his previous  institution,  namely  Shepherd
    Business School.  It was not possible for the  Appellant  to  submit  a
    fresh application while his appeal was pending: see  Section  3C(4)  of
    the Immigration Act 1971.  The judge had erred at paragraph 22  of  his
    determination when he suggested this was a possibility.  The judge  had
    made findings at paragraphs 24 and 25 which were  entirely  unsupported
    by the evidence and/or which his reasons  were  singularly  inadequate.
    The implication in paragraph 24 that there might be some  fault  to  be
    placed on the Appellant because he enrolled at two  colleges,  both  of
    whose licence were revoked "almost immediately" was wrong as there  was
    no basis for that suggestion.

10. At paragraph 25 of the determination it is said by the  judge  that  it
    stretches "the boundaries of coincidence", that the firm of  solicitors
    originally  instructed  by  the  Appellant  were  closed  down  by  the
    Solicitors Regulatory Authority.  It was unclear how  that  coincidence
    is relevant to the  Appellant's  appeal  and  there  was  no  basis  in
    evidence for that suggestion.  It was unclear to what extent the  judge
    had allowed the Appellant an opportunity to comment on these points and
    fairness demanded that he be given such an opportunity.

11. The Appellant accepted the principle in Qureshi but paragraph 245AA  of
    the Immigration  Rules,  which  underpin  the  Respondent's  evidential
    flexibility policy should have been applied to the facts of this  case.



12. The Appellant  made  a  clear  mistake  when  he  sought  to  vary  his
    application in  March  2013  which  would  have  been  obvious  to  the
    caseworker.  The statements disclosed that the  Appellant  had  kept  a
    significant sum of money in his account and it was reasonable to  infer
    that he would still have at least some of that  money.   The  Appellant
    had paid his course fees and it was not a failure by the  Appellant  to
    submit any specified documents; it was a failure to update the sequence
    that he had already provided.

13. Before me Mr Markus  elaborated  on  his  grounds.   It  was  true  the
    Appellant had not submitted fresh bank  statements,  the  reason  being
    that he was confused by the  letter  he  had  received  from  the  Home
    Office.  He had, however, a sum of around �11,000  in  his  account  as
    demonstrated in the first application.   This  was  a  case  where  the
    evidential flexibility policy under paragraph 245AA  should  have  been
    applied.  It was clear that not all the documents  were  present.   The
    Appellant had already shown that he had a significant amount of  money.
    With reference to the guidance on evidential flexibility  (produced)  I
    was referred to page 6 where it was indicated to  the  caseworker  that
    before additional evidence was requested they must have "enough reason"
    to believe the information existed.  Accordingly the threshold was  not
    at a particularly high level and the caseworker would have  had  enough
    reason in this case to believe the information existed because  it  had
    been supplied with the first application.  While the material  was  out
    of date  it  would  have  been  obvious  to  the  caseworker  that  the
    information was available.  I  was  referred  to  various  passages  in
    Rodriguez and Others v SSHD [2014] EWCA  Civ  2  which  supported  that
    proposition.

14. For the Home Office Ms Kenny relied on the Rule 24 notice.   The  judge
    should have dismissed the appeal for reasons given there.  I was  asked
    to find there was no error of law and to uphold the decision.

Conclusions

15. Given that the points-based system applications refer to a fixed period
    of time it can readily be seen that the judge  went  well  beyond  that
    period  in  his  assessment  of  the  evidence  as  set  out   in   his
    determination at paragraphs 21  and  beyond.   In  particular  he  made
    comments about the Appellant enrolling at two colleges  both  of  which
    had their sponsorship licences revoked almost immediately, but  as  the
    grounds of application point out  that  had  nothing  to  do  with  the
    actions of the Appellant. Accordingly the judge's comments to link  the
    events were unfair on the Appellant and constitute an error in law.

16. The judge's comments that were said to  be  arguably  unwise  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge  Lane  relate  to  the  Appellant's  refusal  to  answer
    questions about what advice he was given by his solicitors but it seems
    to me wrong to  criticise  the  Appellant  for  his  response  to  such
    questions as this was a matter of confidentiality between the Appellant
    and his solicitors.  I agree with the submission of Mr Markus that  the
    judge strayed into territory which was not before him and thus erred in
    law.

17. More importantly  the  relevant  time  for  assessing  compliance  with
    Appendix C is the date of variation of  the  original  application  (as
    explained in Quereshi) which the judge did not do and the failure to do
    so was therefore an error in  law.   Because  of  these  errors  it  is
    necessary to set the decision aside and remake the decision.

18. What  has  happened  in  this  case  is  that  the  applicant  made  an
    application for leave to stay  here  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant on the basis that he was going to study  at  Shepherd  Business
    School.  Before any decision had been made on that application  he  was
    told by UKBA that the school had had its sponsorship  licence  revoked.
    As such he then sought to  find  an  alternative  course  provider  and
    submitted  a  CAS  from  Mancunia  College.   Accordingly  this  was  a
    variation of this first application and what the Appellant should  have
    done was to have lodged fresh financial documentation  in  relation  to
    the amendment of his application.  He did not do so.  As I see  it  the
    reasoning in Qureshi does apply and by not lodging fresh  documentation
    in relation to maintenance the Secretary of State was entitled  to  say
    that he did not meet the financial requirements of  the  rules  at  the
    material time and was therefore bound to  award  him  no  points  under
    maintenance  (funds)  which  is  what  happened.   In  that  sense  the
    application was doomed to fail.

19. However, the matter does not end there. It is well  known  there  is  a
    procedure whereby the Respondent, after perusal of an application which
    is in some way incomplete, may go back to  an  applicant  and  ask  for
    further information to be provided. The question before me  is  whether
    this is one of those cases where, under the rules, the  Respondent  was
    obliged to revert to this applicant for the missing information.

20. As was said in Rodriguez requests for further information should not be
    speculative and the instruction then quoted was that caseworkers  "must
    have sufficient reason" to believe that any evidence requested  exists.
    Paragraph 49 of Rodriguez indicates (with reference to  the  evidential
    flexibility guidance) that where there is  uncertainty  as  to  whether
    evidence exists benefit should  be  given  to  the  applicant  and  the
    evidence should be requested.

21. It is not disputed before me that the  Appellant  did  have  sufficient
    monies at the time of the second application to justify a grant  of  10
    points under maintenance (funds).  It is also  not  disputed  that  the
    Appellant  did  have  sufficient  funds  when  he  lodged   the   first
    application. Given the latter it has to have been  obvious  (or  should
    have been) to the caseworker that if further information was  requested
    from the Appellant there was a very  good  chance  that  the  Appellant
    continued to have sufficient funds, particularly given that the  course
    fees of �2,500 had been paid.

22. The rules are not designed to remedy any defect in the application  but
    they are designed to alleviate a possible harshness in  the  strictness
    of those rules. Paragraph 245AA sets out the  procedure  that  will  be
    adopted by the UK Border Agency when there are missing  documents  with
    the application. The Agency will only consider documents that have been
    submitted  with  the  application  and  will  only  consider  documents
    submitted after the application where subparagraph (b)  applies.  Under
    (b) the sub paragraph applies if the applicant  has  submitted  (i)  "A
    sequence of documents and some of the documents have been omitted  (for
    example if one bank statement from a series is missing)" (my italics).

23. Plainly what this means is open  to  interpretation  and  in  my  view,
    without stretching the language of paragraph 245AA  (b)  (i)  too  far,
    this covers the position which was  reached  in  this  case  where  the
    current  bank statement was omitted but had previously been provided in
    terms that would have been found to be satisfactory.

24. I am satisfied,  on  the  particular  facts  of  this  case,  that  the
    Secretary of State  should  have  applied  her  evidential  flexibility
    policy as now set out in the Rules and reverted to  the  Appellant  for
    further information. Had she done so it is more likely  than  not  that
    the  Appellant  would  have  been  able  to   provide   the   necessary
    documentation.

25. For the above reasons the appeal is allowed  to  the  extent  that  the
    Respondent has not made a lawful decision.













Decision

26. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

27. I set aside the decision.

28. The decision of the Secretary of State was not in accordance  with  the
    law with regard to paragraph 245 AA of the Immigration rules.
