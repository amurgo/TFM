                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will  refer  to  the
    original appellant, a citizen of Pakistan born on 15 February 1983,  as
    the appellant herein.

2.   The appellant appeals the decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  on  8
    September 2016 to refuse indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom based on long residency.

3.   The appellant arrived in this country on 6 July 2006 as a  student  and
    his leave was extended on application until he was granted leave  as  a
    Tier 1 (General) Migrant until 21 March 2016.  It is  recorded  in  the
    immigration history that the appellant made a further application on 17
    March 2016 which was discontinued on 24 June 2016 as the appellant  had
    made a further application in Croydon.

4.   The appellant's application  was  considered  under  paragraph  276B  -
    lawful continuous residence for ten years.  However  the  Secretary  of
    State was of the view  that  inconsistent  tax  records  had  been  put
    forward in relation to the appellant's claimed earnings in the tax year
    ending in 2011.  In the appellant's application of 7 March 2011 it  had
    been  stated  that  he  had  previous  earnings  of  �36,848   and   an
    accountant's letter had been submitted in relation to  those  earnings.
    The appellant was accordingly awarded 20 points.  However the  decision
    continues:

         "Information held on your earnings declared to  HMRC  for  the  tax
         year 2010/11 confirmed the following:


         HMRC confirmed for the tax year ending April 2011 your income  from
         all sources was �10,204.   This  comprised  of  only  self-employed
         earnings, HMRC records show you had no other  earnings  during  the
         2011/12 tax year.


         In the light of  the  inconsistency  it  was  considered  that  the
         appellant had used deception in his  previous  application  for  an
         extension of leave in 2011."

5.   The Secretary of State  took  the  view  that  the  appellant  had  not
    declared his earnings correctly and  his  application  was  accordingly
    refused under the general grounds of refusal (paragraph  276B(iii)  and
    paragraph 322(5)).  The appellant appealed against the decision and his
    appeal came before a First-tier Judge on 12 July 2017.   The  appellant
    was represented by Mr Rashid and the Secretary of State was represented
    by a Home Office Presenting Officer (M Hussain).  The judge records  in
    paragraph 6 of his determination that the appellant  gave  evidence  in
    English and identified his statement at pages 1 to 4 in the appellant's
    bundle and that the contents of the statement  were  true.   The  judge
    further records that the  appellant  was  not  cross-examined  on  this
    material.  In paragraph 7 the judge set  out  the  submissions  of  the
    parties as follows:

         "7.1 I heard a submission from the Home Office Presenting  Officer,
             which I have  recorded  in  my  notes  from  the  proceedings.
             Information received from the HMRC differed to that  from  the
             appellant.


         7.2  The appellant's deception had been proved by the HMRC  witness
             statement from dated 20 August 2016 of the appellant's details
             for the Tax Year 2010/11 which stated:


         |Tax       |Description |Accounting  |Turnover/Sale|Taxable/Net |
|Year      |of          |Period      |s/           |Profit after|
|          |Trade       |Ending      |Gross Profit |Expenses/Tax|
|          |            |            |             |            |
|          |            |            |             |Adjustments |
|2010-11   |IT          |05/04/11    |�10204.00    |�6848.00    |
|          |Consultant  |            |             |            |


             I produce at SMITH-0001-SA Calculations  -  AZIZ  Imra  Screen
             Prints of the Tax Calculation details for Tax Tears 2010-11 to
             2012-13.


         7.3  I heard submissions from the appellant's representative, which
             I have recorded in my notes of the proceeding.


         7.4  My attention was drawn to the appellant's name, which is Imran
             Aziz.  The name under the HMRC details shows  ASIZ  Imra  (see
             paragraph 7.1 above).  One might only speculate  whether  this
             accounts for the inconsistency."

6.   Having reviewed the reasons for refusal in the context of the  evidence
    before  him  and  the  submissions  made  the   judge   concluded   his
    determination as follows:

         "8.4 The appellant's bundle includes an HMRC form SA302 (page 13 in
             the  appellant's  bundle)  which  was  sent  by  HMRC  to  the
             appellant by letter dated 11 October  2011  (page  12  in  the
             appellant's bundle).  This shows the  appellant's  profit  for
             the year ended 5 April 2011 from self-employment as  �36848.00
             a deduction of his personal allowance of �6475.00  making  the
             net sum on which tax was due  as  �30373.00.   It  also  shows
             Income Tax and Class 4  National  Insurance  contributions  of
             �8565.24.


         8.5   I  have  considered  whether  the   evidence   supports   the
             respondent's case.


         8.6  The information received by the respondent from HMRC  (Section
             F and G  in  the  respondent's  bundle)  and  the  appellant's
             evidence (pages 12-18 in the appellant's bundle) do not agree.
              Both cannot be right.


         8.7  The best evidence from the  previous  application  made  on  7
             March 2011, which stated the  earnings  of  the  appellant  as
             �36848 for the period 1 May 2010 to 12 February 2011,  is  the
             original application  itself  which  the  respondent  has  not
             produced.


         8.8  I  assessed  the  evidence  in  the  round  and  assessed  the
             appellant's credibility.  The appellant's evidence in a  [sic]
             straightforward.  The appellant was not  cross-examined.   His
             evidence was not challenged.


         8.9  The consequence of the immigration decision will be  to  expel
             the appellant from the United Kingdom until he  secures  entry
             clearance under appendix FM to the immigration rules.  In  the
             same way that it is in the public interest to  exclude  people
             who do not  meet  the  immigration  rules  so  that  effective
             immigration controls can be maintained, there can be no public
             interest in excluding someone who does meet  the  requirements
             because to do so would be to introduce arbitrariness  contrary
             to the rule of law.


         8.10 Mr Hussain's submissions were limited - see 7.1 and 7.2 above.
              He was not authorised to concede the appeal.


         8.11 I find that the Secretary of  State  has  not  discharged  the
             evidential burden of proving  dishonesty  on  the  appellant's
             part.


         8.12 I accept the appellant's analysis and evidence.


         8.13 This is a case where the appellant meets all the  requirements
             of the immigration rules.  The  evidence  and  legal  argument
             that I have accepted show the appellant met and meets all  the
             criteria for indefinite leave based on long residency."

7.   The judge accordingly allowed the appeal under the Rules.

8.   The Secretary of State appealed arguing that the First-tier  Judge  had
    given inadequate reasoning for his decision.  He had failed to  resolve
    the conflict between the  appellant's  evidence  and  the  respondent's
    evidence.   The  judge  had  noted  that   the   appellant's   previous
    application had not  been  produced  but  the  Presenting  Officer  had
    applied for an adjournment to produce the application as it was not  on
    the file.  The Presenting  Officer's  minute  was  referred  to.   This
    adjournment request had not been noted.  No  proper  reasons  had  been
    given for refusing the adjournment request.

9.   In ground 4 it was argued that the  judge  had  given  no  reasons  for
    accepting the appellant's analysis and evidence in paragraph 8.12.   It
    was difficult to understand why the appellant had won his case and  why
    the respondent had lost in the light of the lack of reasoning  and  the
    brevity of  the  decision.   Clear  findings  should  have  been  made.
    Permission to appeal was granted by a Designated Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  A comment was made on paragraph  5.1  of  the  decision
    where the judge had said that the appellant had entered the UK in  2016
    as a student which could not give rise to long  residence.   There  had
    been no reference to the relevant legal framework.

10.  Mr Mills relied on the grounds and submitted  that  there  had  been  a
    complete lack of reasoning and there was procedural unfairness in  that
    the application for the adjournment had not been  recorded.   Reference
    was made to the Presenting Officer's minutes.

11.  Counsel pointed  out  that  the  judge  had  had  the  benefit  of  the
    appellant's witness statement.   The  appellant  had  not  been  cross-
    examined on that statement.  The facts were undisputed.  The  reference
    to 2016 for the date of arrival of the appellant was clearly a  mistake
    and reference to 2006 was plainly intended.  It was not the appellant's
    recollection that there had been  an  adjournment  application  at  the
    first hearing.  Counsel recognised the difficulty about giving evidence
    of what had occurred at that hearing.

12.  Mr Mills referred to  the  Presenting  Officer's  minute  which  it  is
    convenient to set out here:

         "App present and adopted his WS.


         Rep stated that HO have not provide a c opy fo the 2011 application
         made by app, I said form not on this file but we  can  have  matter
         adj to obtain and serve that form, judge said we can deal with  the
         matter without the form


         Subs made on HMRC WS and submitted appellant  has  used  deception,
         app not meet 10  years  residency  as  he  has  used  deception  in
         previous application to HO. Fees


         Reps argue that the HMRC WS is not correct as  its  figure  do  not
         tally up.  The WS states his gross profit as �10204.00 and appendix
         g which is SA302 shows �6848.00.  they also say that  HMRC  is  not
         clear where they got figures."

13.  Reference was made to an accountant's letter of 6 June  2016  in  which
    the accountant said that they had prepared the financial statement  for
    the year ending in February 2011.

14.  The accountant stated

         "We understand that Mr Imran has given  correct  figures  (�36,848)
         about his income to HMRC 2011.  Please see HMRC's  SA302  of  2011.
         We further understand that Mr Imran has  paid  proper  tax  on  his
         declared income.


         The reason for this letter is to confirm that Mr Aziz's income were
         incorrectly calculated and submitted  by  us  mistakenly  after  he
         declared his correct income of �36,848 to  HMRC.   We  investigated
         the matter and found that this was due to a  software  as  well  as
         human  error.   Error  was  made  by  one  of  our  'sub-contractor
         employee' at that time.  He mixed his both  year  expenses  in  one
         year.  Actually error was made during my absence due to  my  annual
         leave.


         After that required procedure was followed to rectify the error and
         Mr Imran's records (income/payment of all taxes)  are  now  updated
         with HMRC.


         I further confirm that Mr Aziz was not in any way at fault  and  we
         (our  sub-contractor)  had  made  an  administrative   error   when
         submitting his online tax returns.  Therefore,  Mr  Imran  has  not
         previously been dishonest in his dealings with HMRC and/or UK Visas
         and Immigration.  ..."

15.  Mr Mills acknowledged that if the judge had accepted  the  accountant's
    letter he could have allowed the appeal but he was unclear why  it  had
    not reached HMRC.

16.  Counsel referred to the witness statement.  A mistake had occurred  for
    which the appellant was not responsible.  The accountant's  letter  set
    out the position.  It had been open to the Presenting Officer to cross-
    examine the appellant and  no  submissions  had  been  made  about  the
    accountant's letter.

17.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Judge if it was materially flawed in law.  Although the decision  is  a
    short one the judge makes it clear  that  he  had  had  regard  to  the
    material before him and had considered the submissions made both orally
    and in writing.  In granting permission to the Secretary of  State  the
    Tribunal referred  to  what  is  clearly  a  typographical  mistake  in
    paragraph 5.  It is clear in paragraph 5.1 that the  reference  to  the
    appellant's arrival in 2016 rather than 2006 was merely a typographical
    mistake.

18.  The key complaint is that the determination is  inadequately  reasoned.
    While it is brief, in my view it is none the worse for that.  The judge
    refers to the material before him and reminds himself of the burden  of
    proof in cases where the respondent alleges deception.

19.  I have had regard to the Presenting Officer's note.   However  it  does
    appear that the appellant was  not  cross-examined  by  the  Presenting
    Officer: the contrary is not stated in the note provided.  I am  unable
    to see any procedural flaw or unfairness in this case.  The note raises
    the question of an adjournment but appears to fall short of recording a
    formal application for one which may explain why the appellant  has  no
    recollection of it. In any event it was up to the Secretary  of  State,
    the burden being on the Secretary of State,  to  provide  the  Tribunal
    with the material on which reliance was placed.   It  would  have  been
    open to the Presenting Officer to cross-examine the appellant and  this
    was not done.  I am not satisfied there was any  procedural  unfairness
    and  in  recording  the  fact  that  the  Presenting  Officer  was  not
    authorised to concede the appeal I  see  no  misrepresentation  of  the
    position.  In cases where the burden is on the  Secretary  of  State  a
    failure  to  cross-examine  the  appellant  on  his  detailed   witness
    statement is not unlikely to have the outcome  that  occurred  in  this
    case.  As Counsel submits the judge accepted the  appellant's  analysis
    of the evidence and  the  evidence  itself.   The  appellant's  account
    includes a detailed critique of the Secretary of State's approach.  The
    appellant makes it  clear  that  on  17  March  2016  he  submitted  an
    application for indefinite leave to remain  and  that  he  varied  this
    application in person on 24 June 2016 paying a fee of �2,375 to  get  a
    decision that day.  The appellant was not contacted thereafter  despite
    a letter having been written by the  appellant  on  8  July  2016.  The
    appellant had made no false representation to the Home  Office  or  any
    government department. An error had occurred in the past which  was  an
    error of his accountant.  He had not submitted an  accountant's  letter
    with his application as such  a  letter  was  not  required  under  the
    particular Rule.  He would have submitted the letter had he been  asked
    for it.

20.  It is quite clear that the judge accepted the appellant's evidence  and
    he was not challenged in cross-examination.  The judge's  approach  was
    not unfair.  It was open to the judge to find on  the  evidence  before
    him that the Secretary of State had not discharged the burden of proof.
     Although the determination is short it is clear in  my  view  why  the
    Secretary of State lost and why the appellant was successful.

21.  The appeal of the Secretary of State is refused  and  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Judge is confirmed.

Anonymity Order

The First-tier Judge made no anonymity order and I make none.


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The judge made a whole fee award of �140 which is confirmed.
