Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr C Timson, instructed by Amjad Malik Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Ammar Hussain Malik, date of birth 16.9.89, is a citizen
    of Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge De Haney promulgated 16.7.14, dismissing his appeal  against  the
    decisions of the respondent, dated 31.3.14, to refuse  his  application
    for leave to remain in the UK outside  the  Immigration  Rules  on  the
    basis of human rights and to remove him to Pakistan.  The  Judge  heard
    the appeal on 26.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    30.9.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.1.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge De Haney should be set aside.

 6. The appeal had been previously before Judge Devlin on  10.6.14  but  at
    the hearing the appellant raised an asylum claim, based on his father's
    asylum claim. Although the Home Office Presenting Officer  stated  that
    the asylum claim had been refused with no right of  appeal,  the  judge
    decided to adjourn for further evidence to be  provided.  It  was  then
    relisted before Judge  De  Haney  on  26.6.14,  when  the  Home  Office
    Presenting   Officer   produced   a   letter   to    the    appellant's
    representatives, dated 17.6.14, notifying them that their claim made by
    post on 10.6.14, the same day as the hearing before Judge Devlin, could
    not be accepted, as claims for international protection are required be
    made in person and not by post.

 7. Judge De Haney proceeded to deal with the appeal on the  basis  of  the
    human rights claim.

 8. At �6 Judge De Haney found that the asylum claim "is  one  which  could
    not be sustained and real questions need to be asked of the appellant's
    instructing solicitors as to why this claim was raised in  the  way  it
    was: vis on the date of the previous hearing, why it was  not  properly
    pleaded and whether indeed it was an abuse of process."

 9. At �21 the judge stated that, "In respect of the asylum and  article  3
    claim it is clear from the evidence which has been given that  this  is
    unsustainable." Similarly, at �25 the  judge  said,  "What  is  equally
    obvious from the facts in this appeal is that the appeal cannot succeed
    under article 3 or the Refugee Convention, nor can it succeed under the
    Immigration Rules..."

10. In essence, the only issue of merit raised in the grounds of appeal  is
    that there has been no reasoned findings on the asylum  and  article  3
    claims, which  were  maintained  during  the  appeal  hearing  and  not
    abandoned, as is clear  from  the  Judge's  handwritten  notes  of  the
    hearing.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Holmes stated, "The  judge  may
    have had good grounds to conclude  that  such  an  appeal  fell  to  be
    dismissed - but arguably he failed to articulate what they were. It  is
    not clear from the determination what the reasons were for his decision
    that the ground "could not be sustained" [6].  Arguably  the  appellant
    did not receive a fair hearing of his appeal."

12. There is absolutely nothing amiss with the  bulk  of  the  decision  of
    Judge De Haney. However, it  is  incumbent  on  the  judge  to  provide
    reasons for dismissing the asylum and article 3  claims.  Even  if  the
    judge considered the claims unsustainable, he must state why, providing
    cogent reasons for that conclusion. It is not necessary for  the  judge
    to rehearse every detail or issue, but he  must  explain  at  least  in
    brief and clear terms why he reached the decision he did, so  that  the
    parties can understand why they have won or lost:  Budhathaki  (reasons
    for decision) [2014] UKUT 00341.

13. In the circumstances, and for the reasons stated, it  is  necessary  to
    set the decision aside for it to be remade.

14. Given that there is nothing wrong with the rest of  the  decision,  and
    that there may well have been good reasons to  regard  the  asylum  and
    article 3 claims as unsustainable,  I  consider  that  the  appropriate
    course is to remit the hearing to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  with  all
    findings preserved other than in relation to asylum and article  3,  so
    that if deemed appropriate and practical, it can come back before Judge
    De Haney to effectively complete the determination  by  addressing  the
    asylum and article 3 issues, providing his reasons  for  dismissing  or
    otherwise considering the claims unsustainable.

15. Mr Timson seeks the opportunity to  make  further  submissions  on  the
    asylum and article 3 claims and thus the appeal should be relisted  for
    an oral hearing. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  can  consider  whether
    further evidence should be admitted.

Conclusion & Decision:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                       I set aside the decision.

                  I remit  the  decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
                  rehearing of the appeal.

Consequential Directions

17. The appeal is to be relisted for hearing in the First-tier Tribunal  at
    Manchester;

18. All findings other  than  in  respect  of  asylum  and  article  3  are
    preserved;

19. The estimated length of hearing is 1.5 hours;

20. If practical and deemed appropriate, there is no reason why the  appeal
    should not be listed before First-tier Tribunal Judge De Haney;

21. Further directions may be given by the First-tier Tribunal.





Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains undecided.
