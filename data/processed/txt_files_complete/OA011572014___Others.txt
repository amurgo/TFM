                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. While the (the "Secretary of State") is, at this stage, the  appellant,
    I shall continue to describe the  three  original  appellants  as  "the
    Appellants".

 2. The Appellants, all citizens  of  Nepal,  are  a  mother  and  her  two
    daughters, the latter now aged 15  and  10  years  respectively.   They
    applied to the Entry Clearance Officer of New  Delhi  (the  "ECO")  for
    permission to enter the United Kingdom for the purpose of settlement as
    the dependants of the first Appellant's  husband  (the  father  of  the
    other two Appellants) under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  (the
    "Rules").  Their applications were refused.  They pursued an appeal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT").  By its decision promulgated on 16
    June 2015 the FtT allowed their appeals. The  Secretary  of  State  has
    been granted permission to appeal to this Tribunal.

The ECO's Decisions

 3. The first ground upon which the applications were refused by the ECO is
    expressed in the following passage in the decision concerning the first
    Appellant:

         "I am not satisfied that your relationship  with  your  Sponsor  is
         genuine and subsisting or that you intend to  live  permanently  in
         the United Kingdom".

    The constituent  elements  of  this  discrete  ground  of  refusal  are
    expressed in fourfold terms:

 a) Having noted the first Appellant's claim that her relationship with her
    husband, who is said to be a disabled person, dates from 1998 in Nepal,
    when she was aged 16, that in 2009 he moved to the  United  Kingdom  as
    the dependant of his father and that they were married in  March  2011,
    the ECO addresses the assertion that they were last together  in  March
    2013 (some  months  before  the  three  inter-related  entry  clearance
    applications were made), when he  allegedly  visited  Nepal.   The  ECO
    concludes that there is no satisfactory evidence of this visit, leading
    to the assessment:

             "I am not satisfied that you have provided evidence of face to
             face  contact which  would  be  consistent  with  your  stated
             relationship".

         [My emphasis]

 b) Next, the ECO considers the evidence of six Skype screenshots  said  to
    relate to three separate calls, stating:

             "I am not satisfied that these screenshots  in  isolation  are
             evidence of an ongoing and subsisting relationship.  You  have
             provided no other evidence whatsoever relating to your ongoing
             contact with each other".

 c) Thirdly, the ECO addresses the evidence consisting of a  DNA  paternity
    test report provided by the National  Forensic  Science  Laboratory  of
    Nepal. Two concerns  are  identified:   first,  that  this  is  not  an
    organisation recognised by UKVI  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  DNA
    tests; and second, that the report contains  no  conclusion  about  the
    paternity of the children. For these  two  reasons,  it  qualifies  for
    "little  evidential  weight".  As  regards   the   birth   registration
    certificates, these too are given "little  evidential  weight"  because
    registration was delayed until five and eleven years respectively after
    the childrens' births.  These assessments lead the ECO to conclude:

             "I am not satisfied that you have provided  adequate  evidence
             that you, your sponsor and your children  are  a  genuine  and
             subsisting family unit".

 d) Next, the ECO notes that the husband/father was  granted  clearance  to
    enter the United Kingdom on 20 May 2009 in his  capacity  of  over  age
    dependant of his parents. Given the claim that, at this time, the first
    Appellant and he had been in a relationship for eleven years in a union
    which had generated two children, the ECO states:

             "These circumstances are not consistent with an application by
             your husband to settle in the United Kingdom as  an  over  age
             dependent relative, an application which would  indicate  that
             he had nobody in Nepal to whom he was close.  Indeed,  in  his
             supporting statement, your husband states  that  when  he  was
             granted entry clearance for  settlement  in  2009,  there  was
             nobody who could care for him in Nepal."

 4.  In  the  next  section  of  the  decision  the  issue  of   "financial
    requirements" is given separate consideration. The ECO  refers  to  the
    requirement of the Rules that the husband, as sponsor, must be able  to
    maintain and accommodate all three Appellants  in  the  United  Kingdom
    without recourse to public funds. It is noted that he is in receipt  of
    Disability  Living  Allowance  ("DLA").  The  ECO  concludes  that  the
    requirement of the Rules is not satisfied.  The decision states:

         "The calculation below sets out your net income after accommodation
         costs has [sic] been deducted.  These figures demonstrate that your
         net income ......... is less than the level  a  British  family  of
         that size would be entitled to under Income Support."

    The calculation which follows is quite straightforward.  The  husband's
    weekly DLA and Employment and Support Allowance  ("ESA")  are  said  to
    total �206.05.  Accommodation costs are noted as nil, given  the  claim
    (evidently accepted) that the sponsor lives rent free in  his  father's
    property.  The United Kingdom Income Support rates for  a  couple  aged
    over 18 years and two additional dependent children are computed to  be
    �261.19 per week. Thus a  shortfall  of  some  �55  was  assessed.  The
    decision continues:

         "Based on the current benefit and tax rates  it  is  apparent  that
         your net income after accommodation costs  have  been  deducted  is
         less than would be available to  a  British  family  of  equivalent
         size.  It  is  therefore  found  that  you  do  not  have  adequate
         maintenance to support you and your partner and any dependants.   I
         am aware that you have provided evidence of third party support  in
         the form of income from your husband's parents, but I am unable  to
         take this into account".

    [Emphasis added]

    This is the second reason proffered for refusing  the  entry  clearance
    applications.

 5. This is followed by a third refusal reason, based on  the  adequacy  of
    the property in which it was proposed that the Appellants would reside.
    Having noted that the occupants of this property  are  the  Appellants'
    husband/father and his father and having acknowledged  the  architect's
    report suggesting that there would be  no  overcrowding,  the  decision
    maker states:

         "However, you have also submitted your father's tenancy  agreement.
         This clearly states that the permitted number of people allowed  to
         reside in the premises  is  five.   In  view  of  this,  I  am  not
         satisfied that there will be adequate accommodation for you without
         recourse to public funds".

 6. To summarise, the Appellants' applications  for  entry  clearance  were
    refused on the following grounds:

 a) The asserted relationship with the sponsor was  not  considered  to  be
    genuine and subsisting.

 b) Linked to (a), It was considered that the Appellants did not intend  to
    live permanently with the sponsor in the United Kingdom.

 c) The Appellants  and  the  sponsor  would  be  unable  to  maintain  and
    accommodate themselves adequately without recourse to public funds.

 d)  The  proposed  accommodation  for  everyone  concerned  would  not  be
    adequate.

Decision of the FtT

 7. Significantly, the appeal proceeded on the basis of an  acknowledgement
    on behalf of the Appellants that they could not  "technically"  satisfy
    the requirements of  the  Rules.   I  shall  revisit  this  infra.  The
    evidence considered by the Tribunal included the oral testimony of  the
    sponsor and his father. Article 8 ECHR was evidently the centrepiece of
    the appeal.  The  Tribunal  noted,  in  [20],  that  the  two  enduring
    contentious issues were (a) whether the  relationship  between  husband
    and wife was genuine and subsisting and (b) financial self-sufficiency.
    As regards the accommodation issue, the Judge noted:

         "It was now conceded that there was evidence as to the adequacy  of
         accommodation".

    Furthermore, the judge recorded that paternity was now conceded.

 8. It is appropriate to reproduce the following passage in the  Tribunal's
    decision:

         "[Counsel for the Appellants] accepted that the  Immigration  Rules
         did not permit third party support.  However,  the  sponsor  had  a
         joint account with his father and had access to the  funds  in  the
         account and there were substantial savings available  to  him.   It
         was accepted that there was a shortfall of �55.14 per week, but she
         asserted that savings could  be  taken  into  account,  which  were
         enough to make up the  shortfall.  She  suggested  that  there  was
         substantial compliance with the Immigration Rules, but just not  in
         the form of the specified documents. I queried  what  her  position
         was on the Immigration Rules and she confirmed that the  Appellants
         did indeed accept that they were unable to meet the requirements of
         the Immigration Rules".

    In this context, the argument advanced on behalf of the Appellants  was
    that there were "weighty proportionality arguments under Article 8".

 9. The FtT found the "total  evidence"  of  the  sponsor  and  his  father
    credible, noting that it was  unchallenged  in  cross-examination.  The
    tribunal  further  found  specifically  that   the   asserted   marital
    relationship is subsisting and that the couple intend to live together.
     It also found that there is a father/child  relationship  between  the
    sponsor and his two daughters, the second  and  third  Appellants.  The
    tribunal further found that the asserted visits in  2013  had  occurred
    and that there was virtually daily contact by telephone  and  internet.
    Next, the tribunal acknowledged the Appellants'  inability  to  satisfy
    the specific maintenance requirements of the Rules.  It  followed,  the
    tribunal reasoned, that the appeals could not succeed under the Rules.

10. The FtT then turned to examine the Article 8 claim, stating:

         "It cannot be right in  principle,  however,  that  simply  because
         somebody is disabled, they therefore cannot be  permitted  to  have
         family  members  join  them.  Whilst  the  financial   aspects   of
         maintenance are clearly important, one would expect to be  able  to
         look at the case and see how  proportionate  adjustments  could  be
         made which do not  undermine  the  legitimate  aim  of  immigration
         control and other public interests."

    Next, the tribunal acknowledged that a successful freestanding  Article
    8 appeal would be "somewhat unlikely". Having done so, the  judge  then
    formulated the test of "exceptional circumstances", continuing:

         "The exceptional circumstances are that the  Sponsor  .........  is
         disabled, but has the benefit of support of parents  who  help  him
         financially. In those circumstances the understandable wish to have
         his wife and children with  him  is,  in  my  estimation,  all  the
         stronger an argument. Whilst, plainly, that does not dispose of the
         matter, I consider that this is clearly  one  of  those  relatively
         rare appeals where there is an unusual set of facts giving rise  to
         a perfectly respectable Article 8 argument outside the Rules."

    The Judge then conducted the "Razgar" exercise, quickly (and correctly)
    concluding that the fundamental issue was that of proportionality.  She
    continued:

         "In considering proportionality in  respect  of  interference  with
         family life, I take account [of] the effect of  Section  117B(1)  -
         (3) of the 2002 Act.  Effective immigration control  is  important,
         but  in  a  case  where  a  disabled  person  cannot  provide   the
         maintenance, but his able-bodied and  economically  active  parents
         can and will provide the necessary maintenance, I find  that  there
         is only limited weight to be attached to  the  public  interest  in
         maintaining  effective  immigration  controls  through   a   strict
         application of this part of  the  Immigration  Rules:  see  Section
         117B(1)".

    The decision continues:

         "I note that the first Appellant has passed her ESOL  test,  albeit
         clearly the Appellants are not fluent in English.  However, this is
         a matter which can be remedied .........

         I attach only limited weight to any  arguments  as  to  fluency  in
         English: Section 117B(2).  The issue of  financial  independence  -
         Section 117B(3) - is linked to the point already made above.  I  do
         accept that this is a public interest factor, but  the  reality  is
         also that disabled people are able to integrate into  society,  but
         will often not  have  the  financial  independence  as  able-bodied
         counterparts. This is a legitimate point to take  into  account  in
         the public interest, also reflected in the Immigration  Rules,  but
         as indicated above the fact that  a  sponsor  is  disabled  adds  a
         further   dimension   to   the   balancing    act    required    by
         proportionality."

    Finally, the FtT found, in terms, that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to
    expect the sponsor  to  return  to  Nepal  and  that  the  family  life
    aspirations in the United Kingdom of all concerned were not tainted  by
    illegitimate economic ambition.

11. In allowing the appeals, the FtT expressed its  omnibus  conclusion  in
    the following terms:

         "In  light  of  the  exceptional  circumstances  of  the  sponsor's
         disability and the  fact  that  the  financial  provisions  of  the
         Immigration Rules could easily in fact be met  if  one  takes  into
         account third party support (which is  clearly  available  in  this
         case), I  consider  that  the  balancing  exercise  in  considering
         proportionality comes  down  in  the  Appellants'  favour.  I  have
         considered the severity and consequences of the interference and  I
         consider that this is a  significant  interference,  especially  in
         view of the sponsor's vulnerability and need for support, in  light
         of his disability .........  I find that the  life  of  the  family
         cannot reasonably be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere ......... and
         I conclude that prejudices the family life of the  applicant  [sic]
         in a manner sufficiently serious to  amount  to  a  breach  of  the
         fundamental right protected by Article 8."

    The appeals were allowed under Article 8 ECHR accordingly.

Permission to Appeal

12. It is appropriate  to  reproduce  in  substantial  part  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal to this Tribunal:

         "2.  The grounds of [the]  application  for  permission  to  appeal
             assert that the judge made a material  error  of  law  in  the
             consideration of maintenance  requirements.   It  is  recorded
             that the judge's  view  [was]  that  maintenance  requirements
             could never be met because of the sponsor's disability and his
             inability therefore to work.  The Respondent submits that this
             is incorrect as third party support is allowed as set  out  in
             FM-SE.

         3.   It is arguable that the judge allowing the Appellants' appeals
             outside the Immigration Rules under Article 8 did  so  in  the
             belief that the Appellants had no alternative route to  entry.
             There is an arguable error of law in this finding."

    Notably, no consideration was given to the materiality of the  arguable
    error of law diagnosed.



Consideration and Conclusions

13. I shall proceed on  the  basis  that,  in  the  context  of  the  three
    conjoined appeals before the FtT, the availability of income from third
    party sources satisfying the financial requirements of the Rules  could
    have been lawfully considered  by  both  the  ECO  and  the  FtT.  This
    concession is clearly implicit in both the grounds of  appeal  and  the
    grant of permission to appeal. It is correctly made, having  regard  to
    Appendix FM-SE of the Rules, paragraph 1(b)(iii), in  particular.  From
    this starting point, I readily adopt, as a second starting  point,  the
    proposition implicit  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  the  grant  of
    permission, namely that it was open to the FtT  to  allow  the  appeals
    under the Rules, rather than Article 8 ECHR.

14. This, in my judgment, quickly and inexorably invites the analysis that,
    as regards the financial requirements  specified  in  the  Rules,  this
    discrete refusal reason advanced by the ECO was erroneous in  law  and,
    therefore, the FtT could lawfully have allowed the  appeals  under  the
    Rules.  There is nothing to the contrary in  either  the  Secretary  of
    State's grounds of appeal or the grant of  permission  to  appeal.   It
    follows that accepting the Secretary of State's appellate challenge  at
    its zenith this is a classic illustration of  an  immaterial  error  of
    law.

15. I note the terms of the final ground of appeal:

         "6.  As a result of this the Judge's further findings about Section
             117B are unlawful as well as the remaining findings at [34]."

    This  invites  two  comments.  The  first  is  that  it  is  strikingly
    unparticularised and, as such, devoid of meaningful content. The second
    is that permission to appeal to this Tribunal has not been  granted  on
    this discrete ground.  I  would  add  that  if  this  ground  had  been
    encompassed within the grant of permission to appeal, my assessment  in
    [13] and [14] above would apply mutatis mutandis.

16.  Finally,  it  is  appropriate  to  record  the  quite   unsatisfactory
    circumstance that the argument canvassed in the  Secretary  of  State's
    grounds of appeal is clearly the antithesis of the position adopted  by
    the Secretary  of  State's  representative  at  the  hearing:  I  refer
    particularly to [20] of the FtT's decision.

Decision

17. On the grounds and for the  reasons  elaborated  above,  I  affirm  the
    decision of the FtT and dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
