                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. Although it is the Secretary of State who is appealing in these
      proceedings, for convenience I will continue to refer to the parties
      hereinafter as in the First-tier Tribunal.

   2. The appellant is a national of the Peoples Republic of China, born in
      July 1985. She is married to [MS], a British national. I will refer to
      him hereinafter as her sponsor.

   3. She came to the United Kingdom in June 2008 as a student. She met her
      sponsor in May 2011. She left the United Kingdom in September 2014 and
      married her sponsor in China on 28 November 2014. She then returned to
      the United Kingdom on 12 February 2015 as his wife.

   4. Her leave was to expire on 30 October 2017. On 2 October 2017 she
      applied for further leave to remain as his spouse. This was refused by
      the respondent on 8 August 2018.

   5.  The application had been considered under appendix FM and was refused
      on suitability grounds. This was because the respondent believed she
      had cheated in relation to an earlier application in an English
      language speaking test completed at Queensway College, London on 3
      April 2013. Her test results had been cancelled by ETS on the basis
      the test was taken by proxy. The voice recording on the appellant's
      test was indicative of a man.

The First tier Tribunal.

   6. Her appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Turnock.A Mandarin
      interpreter was used.

   7. The judge referred to the evidence produced by the respondent in
      support of the claimed cheating. Investigations into the Queensway
      College revealed that of 2793 tests taken between 2012 and 2014, 70%
      were declared invalid by ETS, with the balance considered
      questionable. The appellant's test result showed a speaking score of
      160 and a writing score of 150.

   8.  The judge recorded the appellant's immigration history. The appellant
      attended College in November 2009 and the records showed she was
      progressing in her English studies. On 9 March 2013 she undertook an
      English language test in Manchester but did not achieve a good enough
      score in reading to progress. In April she travelled to London to take
      the test again, staying with a friend for two nights. She described
      the test centre and her friend give evidence of her staying. She
      produced a copy of her bank statement showing a withdrawal in London
      and payment for the train.

   9. The judge accepted the respondent had established a prima facie case
      requiring an explanation. The judge pointed out that her presence of
      the test centre was inconclusive. The judge recognised that fear of
      failing again could be an incentive to use a proxy test taker.

  10. The judge found her account of taking the test consistent and referred
      to the evidence of her attendance at English language courses over the
      years. The judge questioned why, if a proxy test taker was being used,
      a male would have been used.  The judge concluded by finding the
      respondent had not met the legal burden of showing deception. As
      suitability was the only issue the judge found the appellant met the
      requirements of appendix FM.

  11. The judge considered matters in the alternative. By the time of
      hearing the appellant had two children: Arthur, born on 11 January
      2016 and Alice, born on 8 December 2018. Both children are entitled to
      British nationality. Her sponsor earns a salary of ï¿½63,395 per annum.
      The respondent accepted the appellant had a genuine and subsisting
      relationship with her partner and that her two children were
      qualifying children.

  12.  The judge referred to section 117 B and concluded it would be
      disproportionate to refuse to grant leave. The judge found it was in
      the children's best interests to be with both parents. To expect the
      family to relocate to China would mean her husband and her children
      relinquishing their rights as British citizens. The judge concluded it
      would not be reasonable to expect them to leave. Furthermore, the
      appellant at the time of hearing demonstrated she could speak English
      to the necessary standard and that the financial requirements were
      met.

The Upper Tribunal

  13. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the
      judge did not properly assess the evidence.

  14. Mr Tan started by pointing out that the appellant had used an
      interpreter at the appeal hearing. He acknowledged that there could be
      legitimate reasons for doing so but nevertheless the judge had not
      commented on this in any respect.

  15. I was referred to paragraph 25 of the decision were the judge refers
      to a statement from Mr Adam Sewell, an analyst engaged to produce
      reports relating to various test centres. The judge stated there was
      no report attached to his statement and therefore the relevance of his
      evidence was not clear. Mr Tan submitted that the judge failed to
      appreciate that the report on Queensway College is contained at page
      103 of the appeal bundle and was written by Mr Sewell.

  16. Mr Tan pointed out that at paragraph 39 of the decision the appellant
      accepted the voice on the recording for her test was male. The judge
      referred to this at paragraph 51 and found the respondent had
      demonstrated prima facie evidence of deception. The judge recorded the
      appellant as simply suggesting there was an error on the part of the
      respondent. However, Mr Tan submitted there was no evidence to support
      this. At its height, the appellant's evidence demonstrated she was in
      London at the time of the test. He said the judge had not indicated a
      consideration of the report from Prof French which indicated a very
      small percentage of possible false positives.

  17. At paragraph 54 the judge commented that it was surprising the
      appellant's husband had not given evidence, stating that they were
      married at the time of the test. The judge also noted discrepancies
      between the evidence of the appellant and her friend as to when she
      stayed in London. Therefore, there were a number of issues going
      against the appellant yet at paragraph 62 the judge concluded she had
      raised an innocent explanation. Mr. Tan submitted there was no
      balancing of the issues raised.

  18. Mr Tan then referred me to paragraph 78 where the judge considers
      matters in the alternative. He submitted that in doing so the judge
      failed to adequately have regard to the public interest involved in
      the widespread abuses that were taking place in relation to English
      testing. He submitted that the judge appeared to view the appellant's
      financial solvency and subsequent proficiency in English as positive
      factors whereas they should have been considered as neutral.

  19. Miss Patel referred me to the rule 24 response. She submitted that the
      judge asked the right questions at paragraph 49 and submitted the
      respondent was simply disputing the judge's evaluation of the
      evidence. She questioned why, if the appellant were cheating, a male
      tester would be used. Whilst there was a high incidence of cheating at
      the college not all of the results were invalid. Prof. French had
      given an error margin of only 1% but she submitted when the numbers
      involved were considered that 1% was a substantial number of people.
      She submitted it was wrong of the respondent to take issue with the
      appellant's husband not giving evidence. Their relationship was not an
      issue and this was only raised in submissions. She said the judge was
      factually wrong in stating they were married at the time albeit they
      were in a relationship.

Conclusions

  20. The appellant's application under the rules failed on suitability
      grounds. This was because the respondent believed she had cheated in
      an English language test. This in turn called into question her
      character. There has been widespread abuse at some English language
      testing centres. There is now a body of jurisprudence in relation to
      the typical evidence used and the legal assessment. Significantly in
      this case the college where the appellant took the test has a very
      poor history. There was a very high incidence of cheating.

  21. The voice recording relating to the appellant was identified and it
      was accepted by all parties that the voice was male. The appellant's
      answer was that there must have been some mistake but beyond that
      there has been no other explanation. The appellant at hearing gave
      evidence about travelling to London for the test. The judge commented
      on discrepancies between her account of her time in London and that of
      a witness. In any event, the judge made the observation that her
      presence at the test centre did not mean she took the test. Ms Patel
      argued that a 1% margin of error identified by Prof French represents
      a significant number of candidates. Nevertheless, on simple
      percentages the report indicates that the checks carried out using the
      voice recognition technology are very accurate.

  22. The judge had recorded the appellant had taken courses in English at
      paragraph 31 and 32 and was demonstrating progress. However, there
      were significant issues for the appellant to answer. The context was
      in a college which was known to have permitted widespread abuses.

  23. The judge was incorrect in the comments at para 25 made about Mr
      Sewell, the maker of the report on the college. At paragraph 51 the
      judge referred to the generic evidence and the lookup tool and found
      clearly detailed generic and specific prima facie evidence of
      deception. It was accepted the recording relating to the appellant was
      that of a male voice. All the appellant could say was that something
      must have gone wrong with the process. I appreciate in some situations
      this is all that can be said. Nevertheless, this was a significant
      issue for the judge to address.

  24. The judge had referred to inconsistencies between her evidence and
      that of her friend. In any event her presence at the test centre was
      inconclusive. The judge referred to a range of reasons why someone
      with proficiency may engage a proxy test. At paragraph 59 the judge
      referred to the appellant having taken a test shortly before the
      contested test and being unsuccessful. At paragraph 60 the judge makes
      a generalised comment about the appellant's presentation at the
      hearing. She had also produced evidence about attendance at English
      courses.

  25. It was suggested on behalf of the appellant that if she were cheating
      it would have been so foolish as to engage a male proxy. This
      overlooks the gross abuses identified at the test centres and what
      appears to have been a culture of impunity. The judge refers to it
      being strange that the proxy test taker would be male in terms of an
      audit trail. However, the judge does not explore this further in
      relation to the widespread abuses.

  26. I would not place particular weight upon the fact the appellant used a
      Mandarin interpreter at the hearing. It is not apparent if this was
      put to her for comment at the hearing. The hearing itself is not meant
      to be a test of English and the appellant understandably would
      anxious. I also would not attach particular weight to the fact her
      husband did not give evidence. It was really a matter for the
      appellant's representatives to decide what witnesses to call. The
      relationship was not challenged. Arguably he could have given evidence
      about her travelling to London take the test but evidence that had
      already been given.

  27. The judge does ask the correct questions at paragraph 49. I am mindful
      that it was for the judge to reach findings of fact. However, those
      findings must be based upon a demonstrated appraisal of the evidence
      with reasons given. Looking at the decision as a whole I find the
      judge has not indicated why the appellant has discharged the burden. I
      am hesitant about interfering with factual findings. However, having
      regard to the issues raised by the respondent and the evidence
      produced at the hearing it is my conclusion that the judge did err in
      law in concluding the respondent had not shown she had used deception.

  28. The judge did then consider matters beyond the rules. The appellant is
      married to a British national and they have 2 young children. They are
      qualifying children within the meaning of section 117 B (6). There is
      family life and the relationship with her husband was accepted. The
      judge acknowledged at paragraph 78 a strong public interest in
      refusing applicants by individuals who have used deception to
      circumvent the immigration rules. The judge refers to such actions
      seriously undermining immigration control. The judge found it was in
      the best interests of the children to remain with their parents. The
      judge referred to the possibility of the family relocating to China
      but this would mean the appellant's husband and children relinquishing
      their rights as British citizens. The judge accepted that the
      appellant now speaks English and was financially independent.

  29. At the time of hearing the judge did not have the benefit of JG
      (s.117B(6) : "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey [2019] UKUT 72. That
      decision supports the judge's conclusion in relation to the children
      and the application of section 117 B(6). It is my conclusion that any
      deficiencies in the assessment of the test taking do not affect the
      overall outcome. I find the assessment of the position of the children
      is sustainable. Therefore, I find no material error of law
      demonstrated.

Decision.

No material error of law has been established. Consequently, the decision
of First-tier Tribunal Judge Turnock allowing the appeal shall stand.
