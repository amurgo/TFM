Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr M. Biggs, Counsel instructed by Universal
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Singh, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellants are citizens of the Philippines and are husband and
       wife aged 77 and 74 respectively. They appeal, with permission,
       against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, who in a
       determination promulgated on 21 October 2015, dismissed their appeal
       against the decision of the respondent to revoke their residence
       cards.


    2. The history of the appeal is set out in the determination of the
       First-tier Tribunal and also in the determination of Designated
       judge Manuell who originally heard the appeal when it was listed
       before the Upper Tribunal. I need not set out the entire history as
       it is plain from the earlier determinations.


    3. In a decision promulgated on the 26th May I found an error of law in
       the determination of the First Tier-Tribunal and gave my reasons for
       reaching that decision and thus set that decision aside. At the
       conclusion I set out the position of the parties as to re-making the
       decision; Counsel on behalf of the applicants had submitted that the
       appeals should be remitted to the FTT for the reasons he gave and
       set out at paragraph 21. I therefore gave a direction that if it was
       sought to be re-made in the Upper Tribunal the appellant's
       solicitors had 7 days to set out any submissions.


    4. No submissions have been received from any of the parties. In those
       circumstances I am satisfied that the correct approach was that
       submitted by Mr Biggs and that as further oral evidence would be
       required and findings of fact made that the appropriate course is to
       remit the appeal to the First Tier- Tribunal.


Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the first-tier Tribunal made an error on a point of law
    and shall be set aside. It shall be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal
    in  accordance  with   Section  12(2)  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act and paragraph 7.2 of the  Practice  Statement  of  10th
    February 2010 (as amended).

 1. There has been no application made for any anonymity direction.
