                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of Judge R Lloyd of
    the First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 29th April 2015.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FTT.  I will refer to him as the claimant.

 3. The claimant is a male Pakistani  citizen  who  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as the spouse of a British citizen.  The application was refused
    on 13th September 2014.  One of the reasons for refusal  was  that  the
    claimant had submitted an English language test which had been obtained
    by  deception.   The  Secretary  of  State  therefore  referred  to  S-
    LTR.2.2(a) (which is set out below) of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
    rules as a reason for refusal;

         'S-LTR2.2 Whether or not to the applicant's knowledge -

         (a)  false information,  representations  or  documents  have  been
             submitted in relation  to  the  application  (including  false
             information submitted to any person to obtain a document  used
             in support of the application);'

 4. The Secretary of State noted that  following  information  provided  by
    Educational Testing Service (ETS) it was believed  that  a  proxy  test
    taker had undertaken the test instead of the Appellant.

 5. The claimant's appeal was heard by the FTT on 17th April 2015.  The FTT
    heard oral evidence from the Appellant and his spouse  and  found  that
    the Secretary of State had not discharged the burden  of  proving  that
    the claimant had used deception when undertaking his  English  language
    test.  The FTT allowed the appeal under the Immigration rules.

 6. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal.  In summary it
    was submitted that  the  FTT  had  given  inadequate  reasons  for  not
    accepting the evidence produced by the  Secretary  of  State.   It  was
    submitted that the two  witness  statements  that  had  been  submitted
    indicated that proxy test takers had been identified  in  a  number  of
    cases, and evidence had been submitted from  ETS  confirming  that  the
    Appellant's test was  invalid.   Permission  to  appeal  was  initially
    refused on 6th July 2015, but subsequently granted on 28th August  2015
    following submission of a  renewed  application.   The  judge  granting
    permission stated, inter alia;

         "Thus, the observation of the judge at paragraph 9 that  there  was
         no explanation as to why ETS reached the  conclusion  that  a  test
         result  was  not  valid  was  arguably  incorrect.   If   that   is
         established then the conclusion of the judge  that  the  Respondent
         had relied entirely upon 'generic evidence' may  arguably  disclose
         legal error."

 7. Directions were issued that there should be an oral hearing before  the
    Upper Tribunal to ascertain whether the FTT had erred in law such  that
    the decision should be set aside.

The Secretary of State's Submissions

 8. Miss Johnstone relied upon the grounds seeking  permission  to  appeal,
    and the grant of permission.  I was asked to note that the Secretary of
    State had supplied two  witness  statements,  which  although  did  not
    specifically refer to  the  Appellant,  explained  the  nature  of  the
    investigations  that  had  been  carried  out  which  resulted  in  the
    discovery that there had  been  widespread  deception  in  relation  to
    English language tests operated by ETS.  Miss Johnstone submitted  that
    the FTT had given inadequate reasons for allowing the appeal,  and  the
    FTT was incorrect in paragraphs 19(ii) and 21 by stating that  ETS  had
    lost its licence to conduct the tests.  It was however correct that the
    Home Office no longer used ETS to administer English language tests.

The Claimant's Submissions

 9. Mr Holt made lengthy submissions.  I mean no disrespect by not  setting
    them out in full here.  In very brief summary Mr  Holt  submitted  that
    the decision of the FTT disclosed no error of law.  The FTT  was  fully
    entitled to find that the Secretary of State  had  not  discharged  the
    burden of proof,  and  had  given  adequate  reasons  for  making  that
    finding.  Mr Holt pointed out that the  judge  granting  permission  to
    appeal was  wrong  to  state  that  the  FTT  had  concluded  that  the
    Respondent had  relied  entirely  upon  "generic  evidence".   Mr  Holt
    pointed out that the FTT had never stated that,  and  had  specifically
    stated in paragraph 23 that the evidence relied on by the Secretary  of
    State "is generic in part."  I was asked to conclude that the  decision
    of the FTT should stand.

My Conclusions and Reasons

10. I find no material error of law in the decision  of  the  FTT.   It  is
    accepted that the burden of proof is on the Secretary of State, when an
    allegation of dishonesty or deception is made.

11. The Secretary of State has to discharge that burden, and  the  standard
    is a balance of probabilities.

12. The FTT did not conclude that the Secretary of  State  relied  entirely
    upon generic evidence.  The FTT was however correct to  note  that  the
    two witness statements relied upon are generic.  They make no  specific
    reference to the claimant.

13. The FTT noted that the evidence relied upon by the Secretary  of  State
    amounted to the two witness statements and what is described as "a  two
    line table" from ETS which does refer to the  claimant,  and  indicates
    that the tests taken have been marked as invalid.

14. The FTT  assessed  the  evidence.   Although  the  FTT  may  have  been
    technically incorrect in referring to ETS losing a licence, it  is  the
    case that the Secretary of State no longer relies upon ETS to undertake
    the English language test.  The FTT  noted  that  the  Home  Office  no
    longer relied upon ETS and stated in paragraph 21,  having  noted  that
    the witness statements were not specific to the claimant;

         "Furthermore, I approach with caution test results obtained from  a
         company that was responsible for the failures in the  first  place,
         given that that company has now lost its Home Office  licence.   It
         has not given evidence to show how it reached its decision that the
         Appellant had passed the English test by means of deception."

15. The FTT further noted that the claimant's language skills  appeared  to
    be adequate, and that he had undertaken a further test administered  by
    Trinity College on 23rd May 2014.

16. The FTT correctly noted in paragraph 23 that the evidence needed to  be
    considered in the round.  The FTT has balanced the  evidence  submitted
    by the Secretary of State, against the evidence given by the  claimant.
    The FTT noted that the two line table did not provide evidence to  show
    how ETS reached the conclusion that the claimant had passed the English
    test by way of deception.

17. In my view the judge has analysed all the evidence placed  before  him,
    and was entitled to conclude  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  not
    discharged the burden of proof, and gave adequate reasons for  reaching
    that conclusion.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law such that  the  decision  must  be  set
aside.  I do not set aside the decision.  The appeal  of  the  Secretary  of
State is dismissed.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity  direction  and  I  continue  that
order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  rules
2008.
