Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs D. Ofei-Kwatia, Counsel, instructed by M-R
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D. Hayes, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born  on  15  March
       1980. He appeals against the determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Mark-Bell promulgated on 14 March 2013 in which  he  dismissed
       the appellant's appeal against the decision of the  Entry  Clearance
       Officer in Dhaka made on 28 February 2012 refusing  his  application
       for leave to enter the United Kingdom to join his sponsor, a British
       citizen to whom he is married, and their two British children.


    2. The couple were married on 21 January 2009 when his  wife,  born  30
       July 1990, was 19 years of age. She was, however, a British  citizen
       and returned to the United Kingdom on 15 August 2009 by  which  time
       she was pregnant with the couple's first child.  Syed  Ishmaq  Ahmed
       was born on 9 December 2009 and is now 2 � years old.  His  brother,
       Syed Yasmin Ahmed was born on 4 July 2011 and is now 23 months old.



    3. The appellant's wife lives in rented accommodation consisting of two
       bedrooms, living-room, kitchen and bathroom. Initially, the decision
       of the Entry Clearance Officer was to refuse the application on  the
       basis that the appellant failed to establish that  the  requirements
       of paragraph 281(iv) were met, namely, that


         'there will be adequate  accommodation  for  the  parties  and  any
         dependants without recourse to public funds in accommodation  which
         they own or occupy exclusively'.


         On review by the Entry Clearance Manager, the respondent  properly
       withdrew its challenge to this part of the application.  The  appeal
       proceeded solely on the basis  that  the  appellant  had  failed  to
       establish the requirements of paragraph 281(v) namely,


        'the parties will be able to maintain themselves and any dependants
        adequately without recourse to public funds'.


    4. At the hearing before the Judge, the appellant's  wife,  Mrs  Begum,
       provided bank statements showing funds introduced into  her  account
       as cash payments. However, in the case  of  those  that  purportedly
       referred to cash deposits derived from her work  at  "Perfect  Fried
       Chicken" (sometimes misspelt), the entry  upon  her  bank  statement
       variously stated: 'Ref: PFC' or Ref: 'Perfect Fried  Chicken'  or  a
       misspelt variation of it. In paragraph 23 of his determination,  the
       Judge said:


        "Her explanation was that she had written on  the  paying-in  slips
        the employers' names. I do not find this credible. My understanding
        is that the purpose of a paying-in slip together with the  deposits
        of cash is to record who paid it in, not the ostensible  origin  of
        it. Writing on someone else's name proves  nothing.  The  depositor
        could write anybody's name on. So in the absence of evidence to the
        contrary I am not prepared to accept that this happened. Further, I
        am not prepared to accept that the bank would both accept a paying-
        in slip containing someone else's name to that of the depositor and
        that the bank would reproduce such a name on a bank statement  thus
        lending it a credibility that it may not deserve. I therefore  have
        real doubts about the reliability of the photocopied bank statement
        containing such details ..."

    5. Mrs Ofei-Kwatia submitted that it was the universal practice of many
       banks to permit a customer to identify for  their  own  benefit  the
       source of funds paid into the account in cash so  that,  in  future,
       the account holder would be reminded of the source of  the  relevant
       funds. Whilst this is a practice of which I was personally  unaware,
       Mrs Ofei-Kwatia told me that, from personal  experience,  she  knows
       this to be the case. I am bound to say I have  no  reason  to  doubt
       this practice and it makes good sense. If  a  person,  for  example,
       sells a motorcar for cash and  deposits  the  money  into  his  bank
       account, there is every reason for him to  identify  the  source  of
       those funds for future reference in case he forgets the source of  a
       substantial deposit.  For these reasons, I am not satisfied that the
       Judge was entitled,  on  balance  of  probabilities,  to  reach  the
       conclusion that these entries had been falsified  and,  accordingly,
       that no weight could be  attached  to  that  part  of  the  evidence
       directed towards establishing that the  sponsor  derived  an  income
       from PFC. The Judge was not entitled to conclude that there was only
       a discreditable explanation for the entries in the  bank  statements
       when there was an alternative explanation which did not  carry  with
       it the stigma of falsity.  Indeed, I prefer the  benign  explanation
       (which has much to commend it) to that  adopted  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge.  His approach amounts  to  an  error  of  law  whose
       determination was clearly much influenced  by  his  conclusion  that
       false documents had been submitted. (The spelling mistakes  are  not
       those  of  the  Bank,  but  those  of  Mrs  Begum   who   introduced
       inaccuracies into the paying-in slips.)


    6. I am fortified in this view in having another source of  information
       about the work performed by the sponsor with PFC. In the  course  of
       hearing, I permitted Mr Hayes an opportunity  to  consider  original
       documents dating from the period of the decision  in  February  2012
       from HMRC establishing that the sponsor was employed by PFC  at  the
       relevant time and that, broadly speaking, the level  of  income  was
       that described by the sponsor.

    7. I am therefore permitted to re-make the decision.

    8. The appellant's sponsor holds down two jobs.   One,  (which  is  not
       disputed), with the company  called  Spice  Empire  established,  in
       round terms, a net weekly income, from payslips, of �152.99  a  week
       or �663 per month. The income from PFC established a  weekly  income
       of �173.68 a week or �753 a month. Taken together, these two sources
       provide a total income of �1,415 a month. In addition, the appellant
       receives child benefit at the rate of �135 a month,  increasing  the
       available resources to �1,550 a month.

    9. Mrs Ofie-Kwatia extracted  figures  indicating  that  the  level  of
       Income Support that would be notionally available to the sponsor and
       his wife was �459 a month and, for the children, �548 a month.  When
       rent of �375 a month is added to the notional benefits that would be
       provided, a total of �1,374 a month would be provided, substantially
       less than  the  level  of  resources  calculated  in  the  preceding
       paragraph of �1,550 a month.


   10. Mr Hayes, whilst unable to verify the amounts to the pound, accepted
       that Mrs Ofie-Kwatia's calculations were broadly correct.

   11. I am therefore satisfied that the appellant meets  the  requirements
       for entry clearance under paragraph 281 as the spouse of  a  British
       citizen seeking settlement in the United Kingdom to join his wife.


   12. Although  the  grant  of  permission  to  appeal  focuses  upon  the
       inadequate handling of the Article 8  claim,  it  is  apparent  from
       paragraph 4 of the grant that all the issues raised in  the  grounds
       of  appeal  were  arguable.  Consequently,  it  was  open   to   the
       appellant's representative to pursue the appeal on the basis  of  an
       erroneous approach by the Judge in relation to his treatment of  the
       maintenance requirements.

   13. Since I have allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules,  it  is
       unnecessary for me to deal separately with Article 8.  However,  had
       the appellant failed to meet the requirements  for  entry  clearance
       under the Immigration Rules, I would  undoubtedly  have  found  that
       there was family life between the appellant,  his  sponsor  and  his
       children but that it was proportionate to refuse entry clearance. In
       an out-of-country appeal, I see no reason to depart from the balance
       struck in the Rules  themselves  to  the  effect  that  there  is  a
       significant public interest in preventing a  spouse  who  is  not  a
       British citizen from entering the United Kingdom if  the  effect  of
       entry is to impose a burden upon the British taxpayer which he would
       not otherwise have to meet.  A spouse does not  have  the  right  to
       determine his place  of  settlement  and  the  respondent  is  fully
       justified in regulating entry for economic reasons by the imposition
       of a requirement that there should be no additional burden upon  the
       public purse, even in a  case  where  British  (or,  indeed,  Union)
       citizen-children will be affected by the decision.

DECISION

        The Judge made an error on a point of law and I re-make the
        decision in the following terms:


             The appeal is allowed under paragraph 281 of  the  Immigration
             Rules.
