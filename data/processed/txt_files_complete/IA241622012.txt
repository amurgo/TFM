                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Pakistan born on 18th December 1988.
     The Appellant arrived in the UK on 17th  December  2010  when  he  was
    granted leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant until 30th
    April 2014.  That leave was subsequently curtailed in order  to  expire
    on 17th June 2012.  The Appellant applied for further leave  to  remain
    in the same capacity, but that application was refused for the  reasons
    given in the Respondent's letter of 15th October 2012.   The  Appellant
    appealed, and his appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Aujla (the Judge) sitting at Taylor  House  on  23rd  April  2013.   He
    decided to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules for the reasons
    set out in his Determination of 24th April 2013.  The Respondent sought
    leave to appeal that decision, and, on 17th May 2013,  such  permission
    was granted.

 2. At the hearing before me there was no appearance by or on behalf of the
    Appellant.  I decided  to  hear  the  appeal  in  the  absence  of  the
    Appellant under the provisions of Rule 38  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  I was satisfied that  the  Appellant  had
    been notified of the hearing and I considered it in  the  interests  of
    justice to proceed with the hearing.

Error of Law

 3. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 4. The application for leave to remain was refused under the provisions of
    paragraph 245ZX(d) of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules  HC
    395.  This was because the Appellant failed  to  score  10  points  for
    Maintenance (Funds) under Appendix C.  Although the Appellant had  paid
    the course fees of �3,050, he had  failed  to  show  that  he  had  the
    required maintenance funds of �2,000 for the  relevant  consecutive  28
    day period.  The Appellant had produced evidence of such funds held  by
    his Sponsor, Chaudhary Muhammad Yousaf, but had failed to  provide  any
    evidence of his relationship to this person.

 5. The Judge allowed the appeal as he found that the Appellant was the son
    of his Sponsor on the basis of the evidence provided by the Appellant's
    passport and an affidavit from the Sponsor dated 27th August 2012.

 6. At the hearing Mr Tufan  argued  in  accordance  with  the  grounds  of
    application that the Judge had erred in law in that the evidence relied
    upon by the Judge for his finding did not comply with the  requirements
    of paragraph 13B of Appendix C to the Immigration Rules.

 7. I find that I am in agreement with Mr Tufan.  In  order  to  score  the
    necessary points for Maintenance  (Funds)  the  Appellant  relied  upon
    funds held by his father.  That is allowed by paragraph 13 of  Appendix
    C which states as follows:

         "13. Funds will be  available  to  the  applicant  only  where  the
             specified documents show or, where permitted by the Rules, the
             applicant confirms that the funds are held or provided by:

             (ii) The applicant's  parents  or  legal  guardians,  and  the
                  parents or legal guardians have provided  written  consent
                  that their funds may be used by the applicant in order  to
                  study in the UK."

    However, paragraph 13B of Appendix C states as follows:

         "13B.    If the applicant is relying on the provisions in paragraph
                13(ii) above, he must provide:

                (a)    one of the following  original,  or  notarised  copy,
                    documents:

                    (i)     his  birth  certificate  showing  names  of  his
                        parents,

                    (ii)   his certificate of adoption showing the names  of
                        both parents or legal guardian, or

                    (iii)  a Court document naming his legal guardian."

 8. It is not in dispute that the Appellant has not produced any  of  these
    documents, and therefore he has failed to comply with the  requirements
    of paragraph 13 of  Appendix  C  in  which  event  he  does  not  score
    sufficient points for Maintenance (Funds) to meet the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245ZX(d) of HC 395.  I find that the Judge erred  in  law  in
    finding to the contrary and I set his decision aside.

Remade Decision

 9. I remake the decision by dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal  for  the
    reasons given above.

Decision

The making of the decision of the  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
involve the making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005  and  I  see  no
reason to do so.



Signed                              Date 12th August 2013


Upper Tribunal Judge Renton



TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In the light of my  decision  to  remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
dismissing it, I have considered the fee award made  by  the  Judge  of  the
First-tier Tribunal.  As I have dismissed the appeal, I make no fee award.





Signed                              Date 12th August 2013
