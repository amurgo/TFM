Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India born on 17 February 1989. He is
    appealing against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Burns)
    promulgated on 19 April 2017 to dismiss his appeal against the decision
    of the respondent dated 22 January 2016 to refuse his application for
    leave to remain in the UK on the basis of his private and family life
    as the partner of a British citizen.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 2. The First- tier Tribunal made the following findings of fact, which are
    not in dispute:

          1) On 5 October 2016 the appellant married a British citizen.

          2) The marriage is genuine and subsisting, and they live
             together.

          3) Prior to the marriage the appellant and his partner did not
             cohabit and at the time the appellant's application was made
             they neither cohabited nor were engaged.

          4) The appellant was raised in India, where his parents live.

          5) There is no evidence that the appellant and his wife could not
             find accommodation and employment in India.

          6) The appellant's wife is a British citizen, who has lived her
             whole life in the UK and whose family live in London. She has
             visited India.

          7) The appellant entered the UK in 2010 as a student. Since
             February 2015, when his visa expired, he has been in the UK
             unlawfully.

   3. The judge considered whether the appellant was able to satisfy the
      financial requirements of the Immigration Rules. After noting that the
      evidence in the appellant's witness statement concerning his wife's
      income did not establish the financial requirements were met (as the
      amount he claimed she earned was insufficient), the judge stated that:

         "19. At the tribunal hearing I  was  shown  a  letter  from  a  new
         alleged employer stating that [the partner] now works 37.5 hours  a
         week... at the rate of ï¿½10.26 per hour.

         20.  No payslips were produced to support these figures although if
         they are correct and sustained over a year  it  may  be  that  [the
         partner] now meets the income threshold, but I am unable to  accept
         this based simply on the letter, and in any event she  plainly  did
         not at the time of the refusal appealed against."

   4. The judge then considered the appeal under Article 8 ECHR. Having
      found that there was a genuine marriage and Article 8 was engaged, the
      judge proceeded to assess whether removal would be proportionate.
      Applying Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
      2002 ("the 2002 Act"), the judge found that the public interest
      outweighed the appellant's family life given the relationship
      commenced when his immigration status was precarious and the marriage
      was entered into when he was in the UK unlawfully.

Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

   5. The grounds of appeal submit that the judge erred by not making a
      clear decision under Article 8, by failing to carry out a proper
      proportionality assessment and by not applying Razgar and Huang.




   6. In granting permission to appeal, Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam found
      it arguable that the judge did not consider Article 8 on the evidence
      at the date of the hearing.




   7. Before me, Mr Wilford argued that the judge erred by not taking into
      consideration in the proportionality assessment that at the time of
      the hearing the financial requirements under Appendix FM were
      satisfied. He submitted that evidence demonstrating this, in the form
      of payslips, was submitted to the judge and the judge made a factual
      mistake when stating at paragraph 20 (cited above at paragraph 3) that
      no payslips were produced. There were no copies of the aforementioned
      payslips on the court's file. Mr Wilford's explanation was that the
      appellant was unrepresented before the First-tier Tribunal and had
      handed copies of the payslips to the judge who had returned them to
      him without a copy being taken.




   8. A further argument made by Mr Wilford was that the judge failed to
      apply what he characterised as the principle in Chikwamba - that
      because the appellant now satisfies the requirements of the Rules
      there is no public interest in effectively requiring him to leave the
      UK in order to make an application




   9. Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted that the arguments being made by Mr
      Wilford departed substantially from the grounds of appeal, where it
      had not been argued that the judge ignored documents that were handed
      to him at the hearing or that chick one applied. Mr Wilford's response
      was that the grounds are sufficiently loose to encompass his
      submissions.

Analysis

  10. The argument made in the grounds of appeal that the judge failed to
      carry out a proportionality assessment under, or to make a decision in
      respect of, Article 8 ECHR is entirely without merit.




  11. Even on a cursory glance it is obvious that Article 8 has been
      considered in detail. The judge has in a structured and clear way
      followed the five step approach in Razgar. At paragraph 28 the judge
      considered whether there was - and found there to be - family life
      between the appellant and his wife. At paragraph 31 the judge found
      that the interference with the appellant's family life engaged Article
      8. At paragraph 32 the judge considered whether the decision of the
      respondent was in accordance with the law. At paragraphs 33 - 38 the
      judge carried out a proportionality exercise, having regard to the
      mandatory considerations in section 117B of the 2002 Act. On any
      legitimate view, the judge has addressed and made a decision in
      respect of Article 8.




  12. Permission was granted on the basis that the judge had not considered
      Article 8 on the evidence at the date of the hearing. However,
      reviewing the decision as a whole it is apparent that the judge has
      considered evidence post dating the application. The clearest example
      of this is that the judge has taken into account that the appellant
      was married, which was not the case at the date of the application.
      And in paragraphs 16 - 20, where the judge considered evidence of the
      sponsor's income, it is plain that the judge has had regard to up to
      date evidence about the present circumstances. The reason the judge
      did not accept the appellant's claim that the sponsor now earns a
      sufficient income to satisfy the Rules was not that the evidence post
      dated the application but because he did  not accept that the evidence
      adduced (which he found to consist only of a letter and not payslips)
      was sufficient. This conclusion was open to the judge and I am
      satisfied that an error of law was not made.




  13. At the error of law hearing, Mr Wilford argued that the judge erred by
      failing to have regard to payslips showing the sponsor's income. He
      claimed that these were handed to the judge at the hearing but not
      retained for the court file. The difficulty with this argument is that
      the judge, at paragraph 20, has stated in clear terms that payslips
      were not produced and there is nothing on the court file to indicate
      they were.  Noting that the decision is dated 8 April 2017 (only 2
      days after the hearing) I consider it unlikely the judge would have
      forgotten, when drafting the decision, that he had seen the payslips.
      Accordingly, I do not accept the judge was given the payslips. The
      failure to consider them in the decision was therefore not an error of
      law.




  14. Mr Wilford's "Chikwamba" submission is premised on the assumption that
      the appellant satisfied the financial requirements of the Rules at the
      date of the hearing. However, for reasons that were open to him
      (principally, that the only evidence adduced - a letter - was
      insufficient) this assumption is not correct. The judge could not have
      erred by failing to consider whether there was a public interest in
      removing someone who could meet the Rules when it was not accepted
      that the appellant could in fact meet the Rules.




  15. The appellant is unable to succeed on any of the grounds raised
      (including those raised for the first time at the hearing) and the
      appeal is dismissed.

Decision

16. The appeal is dismissed.

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain a material
    error of law and stands.
