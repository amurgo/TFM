               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Heybrook, Counsel instructed by Carmelite Law
Practice
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
of the
     Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka.  Her date of birth is 30  July
    1978. Her appeal against the  respondent's  decision  that  deportation
    does not breach her rights under Article 8 of ECHR was allowed  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  That decision was set aside by the Upper Tribunal
    on 20 March 2009 following a hearing at Field House on  5  March  2019.
    The appeal was listed before  me  on  24th  June  2019  to  remake  the
    decision.

2.   It was conceded by the Secretary of State in the  Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter that the effect of deportation of the appellant would be  unduly
    harsh on the appellant's British citizen children insofar as  it  would
    result in them having to relocate with their mother to Sri Lanka.

3.   Mr Tufan stated that having considered the  conclusions  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in the decision of 15 March 2019 (following the hearing  on  5
    March 2019) the Secretary of State  conceded that the  combined  effect
    of the findings is that the appellant succeeds on  appeal  against  the
    human rights refusal under the Immigration Rules and  Section  117C  of
    the NIAA 2002 with reference to  339B  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    Section 117C(3) of NIAA 2002.

4.   Both  parties  therefore  asked  for  the  appeal  to  be  allowed.   I
    therefore allow the appeal under Article 8 of the  1950  Convention  on
    Human Rights.  There was no need for me to determine the appeal on  the
    Zambrano point raised by the appellant.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
