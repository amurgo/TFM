R (on the application of MK, IK (a child by his litigation friend MK)
and HK (a child by her litigation friend MK) v Secretary of State for
the Home Department (Calais; Dublin Regulation - investigative duty)
IJR [2016] UKUT 00231 (IAC)

                               Upper Tribunal
                       Immigration and Asylum Chamber

                       Judicial Review Decision Notice

  The Queen on the application of MK, IK (a child by his litigation friend
              MK) and HK (a child by her litigation friend MK)

                                                                  Applicants
                                      v



                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


            Before The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey, President
                       Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane




 i) In making a decision whether to accept a "take  charge"  request  under
    the Dublin Regulation, the Secretary of State is obliged  to  take  all
    material considerations into account and to comply with the  "Tameside"
    duty of enquiry.

ii) The Dublin Regulation and its sister instrument, Commission  Regulation
    (EC) 1550/2003, subject the Secretary of State to  duties  of  enquiry,
    investigation and evidence gathering.  The discharge  of  these  duties
    will be factually and contextually sensitive and  is  governed  by  the
    principle that the Secretary of State is  obliged  to  take  reasonable
    steps.

iii) In a context where there are  successive  "take  charge"  requests  and
    successive decisions in response  thereto,  the  aforementioned  duties
    apply throughout.

iv) The aforementioned duties may also arise via the  procedural  dimension
    of Article 8 ECHR, under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

 v) The principles rehearsed above may give rise to a remedy  comprising  a
    mandatory order requiring the Secretary of State to take all reasonable
    steps and use her best endeavours in certain specified respects.
            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Ms C Kilroy and Ms M  Knorr,  both  of  counsel,
instructed by Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, on behalf of the Applicants and Mr  B
Keith, of counsel, instructed by the Government Legal Department, on  behalf
of the Respondent at a hearing at Field House, London on 21 April 2016.


      Decision: the Applicants are granted permission to apply for  judicial
review, the application for judicial review succeeds and the Applicants  are
granted relief in the terms set forth in [54] of this judgment


McCLOSKEY J


Anonymity

 1) All of the Applicants have been granted anonymity  on  account  of  the
    ages and vulnerabilities of the second and third Applicants.  Thus  any
    communication  or  publication  which  either  identifies  any  of  the
    Applicants or could have this effect is prohibited and,  if  occurring,
    may have adverse consequences, including contempt action.


Introduction

 2)  There  is  one  contentious  issue,  of  not  less  than   fundamental
    importance, as between the Applicants and the Respondent, the Secretary
    of State for the Home Department (the "Secretary of  State").    It  is
    asserted that the first Applicant (MK) is the mother of the second  and
    third Applicants (IK and HK), both teenagers.  The Secretary  of  State
    is not persuaded by this assertion.   This  disbelief  has  formed  the
    cornerstone of  the  decision  making  lying  at  the  heart  of  these
    proceedings.   By  this  challenge  the  Applicants  invite  the  Upper
    Tribunal to intervene and grant appropriate relief.


The Applicants' Case

 3) The Applicants claim to be nationals of Iraq. It is asserted  that  the
    second and third Applicants, IK and HK,  resided  in  "the  jungle"  in
    Calais, France for a period of some 2 ï¿½ months, dating  from  September
    2015, subsequent whereto they have been  living  with  a  local  French
    family pursuant to a species of fostering arrangements.
 4) The first Applicant, MK, who is said  to  be  their  mother,  has  been
    residing lawfully  in  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to  a  grant  of
    indefinite leave to remain, having been  recognised  as  a  refugee  in
    March 2010.   Throughout her sojourn in  the  United  Kingdom  she  has
    lived with three of her seven living children (one daughter having died
    in Iraq) whose ages range from 6 to 16  years.   She  has  since  given
    birth to a further son, aged one year.  IK, a male and  HK,  a  female,
    aged 17 and 15 years respectively are said to be the second and  fourth
    oldest of her children.

 5) In her witness statements MK describes a troubled marriage to her first
    husband, who died around 2006.  In February 2007 MK  and  her  children
    travelled from Iraq to Syria.  It appears that her  deceased  husband's
    mother, who was consistently hostile to her, continued to form part  of
    their lives.  In circumstances of threat and coercion,  her  mother  in
    law (it is claimed) took IK and HK from MK, warning that they would not
    be seen by MK again.  In one of her witness statements MK recounts:

           "I thought I had lost [IK and HK].  I thought that I would never
           see them again.  I cannot describe how painful, as a mother,  it
           was to lose them like this. .....


           I would not talk about them and if one  of  the  other  children
           started to talk about them I would change the subject."

    MK claims that she and her remaining children left  Syria  in  November
    2009 and, aided by  so-called  people  smugglers,  reached  the  United
    Kingdom on 23 December 2009.  On  09  March  2010  she  and  her  three
    accompanying children were granted asylum.

 6) In the events which have occurred,  a  single  aspect  of  MK's  asylum
    interview, conducted on 16 February 2010, has evolved into a matter  of
    critical importance.  In the course of questioning about  the  family's
    life in Syria, the following exchange occurred:

           "Did your children live with you?


           Yes, I had five kids, only three are here.  I don't  know  where
           my eldest son is, my daughter died before she was two."


    The decisions on behalf of the Secretary of State  precipitating  these
    proceedings are contained in successive letters, both dated 12 February
    2016, addressed to the relevant French authorities.  These letters were
    responding to a formal request that the United Kingdom "take charge" of
    IK and HK under the regime  of  Council  Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2013
    (hereinafter the "Dublin Regulation").  The letters are in all material
    respects identical and include the following key passages:


           "You have stated that the mother of [IK and  HK]  lives  in  the
           United Kingdom and has status here ....


           I have to inform you that I have studied the original  documents
           and interview statements made by [MK] in her asylum  application
           in 2010 and compared them with the statements attached  to  your
           formal request.  I regret that I  am  unable  to  reconcile  the
           family statements given in 2010 to [sic]  those  given  in  2016
           ....


           Therefore, unless further evidence of the  family  relationship,
           such as a DNA match, is received, I regret to  inform  you  that
           your request to take charge of the above named  is  respectfully
           denied."


            [Emphasis added.]

 7) Resuming the narrative, it is asserted by IK and HK that, following the
    separation from their mother (MK) and siblings in Syria, they  remained
    with their paternal grandmother, living in Iraq.  Some two years later,
    in 2012, due to the deteriorating situation in Iraq, the three of  them
    went to live in Turkey.  In early 2015 their paternal grandmother died.
     IK and HK then travelled to Izmir where they made contact with an aunt
    who,  in  turn,  communicated   with   their   mother.    Subsequently,
    arrangements were made for IK and HK to  travel  to  Europe,  following
    which their sojourn in Calais began.

 8) Communications among the three Applicants had been restored by the time
    they met with their United Kingdom solicitors in November 2015.  Events
    during this phase included a meeting attended by MK and  the  solicitor
    concerned.  In the solicitor's  witness  statement,  the  following  is
    recounted:

           "[MK] had given up hope of  seeing  [IK  and  HK]  again.   [MK]
           expressed her very strong wish to be reunited with [them].   She
           said she would do anything to  be  able  to  hold  her  children
           again.  She asked me to do all I can to make this happen as soon
           as possible."


    In the aforementioned context family photographs said to depict  (inter
    alios) IK and HK were provided by IK to his legal representatives.

 9) The evidence includes quite detailed accounts provided  by  IK  and  HK
    reproduced  in  two  reports  of  a  consultant  child  and  adolescent
    psychiatrist.  The accounts contained  in  the  reports  are,  in  many
    respects, in substance consistent with the  case  made  by  MK  in  her
    asylum interview and her more recent witness statements,  generated  in
    the  context  of  these  proceedings.  In  this  context  it  is   also
    appropriate  to  highlight  the  evidence  suggesting  daily  telephone
    contact among the three Applicants since communications were reinstated
    some  months  ago.   At  this  juncture  we  mention  also  the  expert
    psychiatric assessment that IK and HK are  suffering  from  significant
    psychological disorders.  As regards IK, the expert states:

           "['His] overwhelming need is for reunification with his  family,
           to be relieved of the responsibility for  the  safety  and  well
           being of his sister, an end to the uncertainty and insecurity of
           being a refugee in Calais and to have a secure home."

    With regard to HK, the expert states:

           "She is extremely vulnerable and regressed  and  has  an  urgent
           need for reunification with her mother and a secure home."


The Secretary of State's Stance

10) In the narrative above we have referred to what may be described as the
    Secretary of State's primary decision, namely the refusal to accede  to
    the "take charge" requests of the French authorities, vis-ï¿½-vis IK  and
    HK, dated 12 February 2016.  Undeterred, the French  authorities  urged
    the Secretary  of  State  to  reconsider.  This  stimulated  a  further
    decision on behalf of the Secretary of State (postdating the initiation
    of these proceedings), dated  16  March  2016.   Having  rehearsed  the
    various materials, all provided by the French authorities,  purportedly
    considered and MK's asylum  interview  record  of  February  2010,  the
    decision states, in material part:

           "It is noted that [MK] failed to mention [HK or IK] at any point
           during her asylum interview nor was there any indication of [MK]
           having any other children ....


           [This failure] .....   damages the credibility of her  claim  to
           be their mother .....


           During the interview [MK] made no reference to her former mother
           in law taking [IK and HK] or the threat she  claims  her  former
           mother in law made stating she would have her killed.  It is not
           considered credible that  [MK]  would  choose  not  to  disclose
           this."




      Next, the decision maker, assessing the witness statements of three of
      MK's other children, offers the criticism that:


           "....  the  statements  contain  remarkably  similar  sentences,
           paragraphs and structure."

      The decision continues:

           "It is also noted that family photographs  have  been  submitted
           along with recent  photos  of  [IK  and  HK]  taken  in  Calais.
           However upon analysis of the photographs, given the  passage  of
           time it cannot be stated that the individuals that appear in the
           family photographs are those pictured in the recent photos."

    These assessments give rise to the following omnibus conclusion:

           "Taking the evidence in the round it is concluded that the fresh
           evidence referred to in the paragraphs above does not remove the
           significant doubt that remains about  the  relationship  between
           [the three Applicants]."

11) The initiation of these proceedings and the  subsequent  generation  of
    further evidence on behalf of the Applicants gave rise  to  a  further,
    third decision on behalf of the Secretary  of  State,  contained  in  a
    letter dated 19 April 2016, two days prior to the "rolled  up"  hearing
    directed by order of this Tribunal  dated  08  March  2016.   The  main
    impetus for this further decision was evidently the aforementioned  two
    psychiatric reports.  The decision maker states:

           "The information provided about the difficult situation  of  the
           children in Calais and their psychiatric trauma does not address
           the central issue of 'proven family links' raised in the  SSHD's
           reconsideration of the take charge request .....


           The SSHD does not consider that the further  material  submitted
           above demonstrates 'proven family link'."

    In common with the two earlier decisions, this decision then highlights
    the answer given by MK during her asylum interview in 2010,  reproduced
    in [6] above.

12) It is appropriate to observe at this juncture that the advent  of  this
    third decision on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  addressed  the
    Tribunal's concern  that  it  might  find  itself  in  a  situation  of
    considering material evidence not previously considered by the  primary
    decision maker, in conjunction with a litigation  context  of  "rolling
    review": see R (N) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  (JR  -
    Scope - Evidence) IJR [2015] UKUT 437 (IAC) at [70] - [75].


Legal Framework

13) There is no dispute inter-partes about the governing  legal  framework.
    While this, of course, is not binding on the Tribunal we have no reason
    to disagree with the parties' assessment.

The Dublin Regulation

14) This measure of EU law establishes  the  criteria  and  mechanisms  for
    determining which EU Member State is  responsible  for  "examining"  an
    asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a national  of
    a non-EU country.  Within chapter III there is a hierarchy of  criteria
    to be applied in making this determination.  The Regulation has the aim
    of establishing a regime which will operate in a fair,  consistent  and
    foreseeable way.  It is an instrument which also aims to be efficacious
    and viable in practice.  The regime is designed, per the fifth recital,
    to:

           "....  make it possible to determine rapidly  the  Member  State
           responsible,  so  as  to  guarantee  effective  access  to   the
           procedures for granting  international  protection  and  not  to
           compromise the objective of the rapid processing of applications
           for international protection."

    It is a measure which forms part of the  common  EU  policy  on  asylum
    which, in turn, includes the Common European  Asylum  System  ("CEAS").
    It is, per the second recital:


           "....  a consistent part of the European  Union's  objective  of
           progressively establishing an  area  of  freedom,  security  and
           justice open to those who, forced by circumstances, legitimately
           seek protection in the Union."

15)  One  of  the  features  of  the  current  incarnation  of  the  Dublin
    Regulation, in force from 01 January 2014,  is  the  special  provision
    which it makes for protecting children.  Given the issues raised in the
    present challenge, it is appropriate to reproduce  in  full  Article  6
    which, under the heading "Guarantees for Minors", provides:

           "1.  The  best  interests  of  the  child  shall  be  a  primary
           consideration for Member States with respect to  all  procedures
           provided for in this Regulation.


           2. Member States shall ensure that a  representative  represents
           and/or assists  an  unaccompanied  minor  with  respect  to  all
           procedures provided for in this Regulation.  The  representative
           shall have the qualifications and expertise to ensure  that  the
           best interests of the minor are taken into consideration  during
           the  procedures  carried  out  under   this   Regulation.   Such
           representative shall have access to the content of the  relevant
           documents in the applicant's file including the specific leaflet
           for unaccompanied minors.


           This paragraph  shall  be  without  prejudice  to  the  relevant
           provisions in Article 25 of Directive 2013/32/EU.


           3. In assessing the best interests of the child,  Member  States
           shall  closely  cooperate  with  each  other   and   shall,   in
           particular, take due account of the following factors:


             (a) family reunification possibilities;


             (b) the minor's well-being and social development;


             (c) safety and security considerations,  in  particular  where
             there is  a  risk  of  the  minor  being  a  victim  of  human
             trafficking;


             (d) the views of the minor, in accordance with his or her  age
             and maturity.


           4. For the purpose of applying Article 8, the Member State where
           the unaccompanied minor lodged an application for  international
           protection shall, as soon as possible, take  appropriate  action
           to identify the family members, siblings  or  relatives  of  the
           unaccompanied minor on the territory of  Member  States,  whilst
           protecting the best interests of the child.
           To that end, that Member State may call for  the  assistance  of
           international  or  other   relevant   organisations,   and   may
           facilitate the minor's access to the tracing  services  of  such
           organisations.
           The staff of the competent authorities referred to in Article 35
           who deal with requests  concerning  unaccompanied  minors  shall
           have  received,  and  shall  continue  to  receive,  appropriate
           training concerning the specific needs of minors.


           5. With  a  view  to  facilitating  the  appropriate  action  to
           identify the  family  members,  siblings  or  relatives  of  the
           unaccompanied minor living in the territory  of  another  Member
           State pursuant to paragraph 4 of this  Article,  the  Commission
           shall adopt implementing acts including a standard form for  the
           exchange of relevant information between  Member  States.  Those
           implementing acts  shall  be  adopted  in  accordance  with  the
           examination procedure referred to in Article 44(2)."

16) The prescribed criteria for determining the  Member  State  responsible
    operate in the hierarchical order set forth in Chapter III, per Article
    7.  Article 8, which enshrines the first of these  criteria,  provides,
    under the rubric "Minors":


           "1. Where the applicant is an unaccompanied  minor,  the  Member
           State responsible shall be that  where  a  family  member  or  a
           sibling of the unaccompanied minor is legally present,  provided
           that it is in  the  best  interests  of  the  minor.  Where  the
           applicant is a married minor whose spouse is not legally present
           on  the  territory  of  the  Member  States,  the  Member  State
           responsible shall be the Member State where the  father,  mother
           or other adult responsible for the minor, whether by law  or  by
           the practice  of  that  Member  State,  or  sibling  is  legally
           present.

           2. Where the applicant is  an  unaccompanied  minor  who  has  a
           relative who is legally present  in  another  Member  State  and
           where it is established, based  on  an  individual  examination,
           that


           the relative can take care of him  or  her,  that  Member  State
           shall unite the minor with his or her relative and shall be  the
           Member State responsible,  provided  that  it  is  in  the  best
           interests of the minor.


           3. Where family members, siblings or relatives as referred to in
           paragraphs 1 and 2, stay in more  than  one  Member  State,  the
           Member State responsible shall be decided on the basis  of  what
           is in the best interests of the unaccompanied minor.


           4. In the absence of a family member, a sibling or a relative as
           referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Member State  responsible
           shall be that where the unaccompanied minor has  lodged  his  or
           her application for international protection, provided  that  it
           is in the best interests of the minor.

           5. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts  in
           accordance with Article  45  concerning  the  identification  of
           family members,  siblings  or  relatives  of  the  unaccompanied
           minor; the criteria for establishing  the  existence  of  proven
           family links; the criteria  for  assessing  the  capacity  of  a
           relative to take care  of  the  unaccompanied  minor,  including
           where family members, siblings or relatives of the unaccompanied
           minor stay in more than one  Member  State.  In  exercising  its
           powers to adopt delegated acts, the Commission shall not  exceed
           the scope of the best interests of the  child  as  provided  for
           under Article 6(3).


           6.  The  Commission  shall,  by  means  of  implementing   acts,
           establish  uniform  conditions  for  the  consultation  and  the
           exchange   of   information   between   Member   States.   Those
           implementing acts  shall  be  adopted  in  accordance  with  the
           examination procedure referred to in Article 44(2)."

17) Article 22  features  in  the  factual  matrix  giving  rise  to  these
    proceedings.  It provides:

           "1. The requested Member State shall make the necessary  checks,
           and shall give a decision on the request to take  charge  of  an
           applicant within two months of receipt of the request.


           2. In the procedure for determining the Member State responsible
           elements of proof and circumstantial evidence shall be used.


           3.  The  Commission  shall,  by  means  of  implementing   acts,
           establish, and review periodically, two  lists,  indicating  the
           relevant  elements  of  proof  and  circumstantial  evidence  in
           accordance with the criteria set out in points (a)  and  (b)  of
           this paragraph. Those implementing  acts  shall  be  adopted  in
           accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article
           44(2).


             (a) Proof:


                (i)  this  refers   to   formal   proof   which   determines
                responsibility pursuant to this Regulation, as long as it is
                not refuted by proof to the contrary;
                (ii) the Member States shall provide the Committee  provided
                for in Article 44 with models  of  the  different  types  of
                administrative documents, in accordance  with  the  typology
                established in the list of formal proofs;


             (b) Circumstantial evidence:


                (i) this refers to indicative  elements  which  while  being
                refutable may be sufficient, in certain cases, according  to
                the evidentiary value attributed to them;
                (ii)  their  evidentiary   value,   in   relation   to   the
                responsibility   for   examining   the    application    for
                international protection shall be assessed on a case-by-case
                basis.


           4. The requirement of proof should not exceed what is  necessary
           for the proper application of this Regulation.


           5. If there is no formal proof, the requested Member State shall
           acknowledge its responsibility if the circumstantial evidence is
           coherent, verifiable  and  sufficiently  detailed  to  establish
           responsibility.


           6. Where the requesting Member  State  has  pleaded  urgency  in
           accordance with the provisions of Article 21(2),  the  requested
           Member State shall make every effort to  comply  with  the  time
           limit  requested.  In  exceptional  cases,  where  it   can   be
           demonstrated that the examination of a request for taking charge
           of an applicant is particularly complex,  the  requested  Member
           State may give its reply after the time limit requested, but  in
           any event within one month. In  such  situations  the  requested
           Member State must communicate its decision to postpone  a  reply
           to the requesting Member State within the time limit  originally
           requested.


           7. Failure to act  within  the  two-month  period  mentioned  in
           paragraph 1 and the one-month period mentioned  in  paragraph  6
           shall be tantamount to accepting the  request,  and  entail  the
           obligation  to  take  charge  of  the  person,   including   the
           obligation to provide for proper arrangements for arrival."

    Commission Regulation (EC) 1550/2003

18) As appears from the provisions set out  above,  the  Dublin  Regulation
    contemplates certain "implementing acts" on the part  of  the  European
    Commission.  This complementary  legislation  is  contained  partly  in
    Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  118/2014   (the   "2014
    Regulation").  This measure both amends and preserves its  predecessor,
    Regulation (EC) No 1560/2003 (the "2003 Regulation").   Article  12  of
    the  2003  Regulation  is  directed  exclusively  to   the   topic   of
    unaccompanied minors. It provides, as amended, in material part:

           "3. With a  view  to  facilitating  the  appropriate  action  to
           identify  the  family  members,  siblings  or  relatives  of  an
           unaccompanied minor, the Member State with which an  application
           for international protection  was  lodged  by  an  unaccompanied
           minor shall, after holding the personal  interview  pursuant  to
           Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 in the presence of  the
           representative referred to in Article 6(2) of  that  Regulation,
           search for and/or take into account any information provided  by
           the minor or coming from any other credible source familiar with
           the personal situation or the route followed by the minor  or  a
           member of his or her family, sibling or relative.


           The authorities carrying out the  process  of  establishing  the
           Member State responsible for examining  the  application  of  an
           unaccompanied minor shall involve the representative referred to
           in Article 6(2) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 in  this  process
           to the greatest extent possible.


           4. Where in the application of the  obligations  resulting  from
           Article 8 of Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2013,  the  Member  State
           carrying out  the  process  of  establishing  the  Member  State
           responsible for examining the application  of  an  unaccompanied
           minor is in possession of information that makes it possible  to
           start identifying  and/or  locating  a  member  of  the  family,
           sibling or relative,  that  Member  State  shall  consult  other
           Member States, as  appropriate,  and  exchange  information,  in
           order to:


             (a) identify family members,  siblings  or  relatives  of  the
             unaccompanied minor, present on the territory  of  the  Member
             States;


             (b) establish the existence of proven family links;


             (c) assess the capacity of a relative  to  take  care  of  the
             unaccompanied minor, including where family members,  siblings
             or relatives of the unaccompanied minor stay in more than  one
             Member State.


           5. Where the exchange of information referred to in paragraph  4
           indicates that more family members, siblings  or  relatives  are
           present in another Member State  or  States,  the  Member  State
           where the unaccompanied minor is present  shall  cooperate  with
           the relevant Member State  or  States,  to  determine  the  most
           appropriate person to whom the minor is to be entrusted, and  in
           particular to establish:


             (a) the strength of the family links between the minor and the
             different persons identified on the territories of the  Member
             States;


             (b) the capacity and availability of the persons concerned  to
             take care of the minor;


             (c) the best interests of the minor in each case.


           6. In order to carry out the exchange of information referred to
           in paragraph 4, the standard form set out in Annex VIII to  this
           Regulation shall be used.


           The requested Member State shall endeavour to reply within  four
           weeks from the receipt of the request. Where compelling evidence
           indicates  that  further  investigations  would  lead  to   more
           relevant information, the requested Member State will inform the
           requesting Member State that two additional weeks are needed.


           The request for information pursuant to this  Article  shall  be
           carried  out  ensuring  full  compliance  with   the   deadlines
           presented in Articles 21(1), 22(1), 23(2), 24(2)  and  25(1)  of
           Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2013.  This  obligation   is   without
           prejudice to Article 34(5) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013."


19) The amended 2003 Regulation is notably prescriptive, as the substituted
    Article 15(1) demonstrates:


           "Requests, replies and all written correspondence between Member
           States concerning the  application  of  Regulation  (EU)  Number
           604/2013  shall  be  sent  through  the  "DubliNet"   electronic
           communications  network,  set  up  under  Title   II   of   this
           Regulation."

    Article 3 of the 2003 Regulation remains unaffected by  the  amendments
    introduced by the 2014 Regulation.  Under  the  rubric  of  "Processing
    Requests for Taking Charge", it provides:

           "1. The arguments in law and in fact  set  out  in  the  request
           shall be examined in the light of the provisions  of  Regulation
           (EC) No 343/2003 and  the  lists  of  proof  and  circumstantial
           evidence  which  are  set  out  in  Annex  II  to  the   present
           Regulation.


           Whatever the criteria  and  provisions  of  Regulation  (EC)  No
           343/2003 that are relied on, the requested Member  State  shall,
           within the time  allowed  by  Article  18(1)  and  (6)  of  that
           Regulation, check exhaustively and objectively, on the basis  of
           all information directly or indirectly available to it,  whether
           its responsibility for examining the application for  asylum  is
           established. If the checks by the requested Member State  reveal
           that it is responsible under at least one  of  the  criteria  of
           that Regulation, it shall acknowledge its responsibility."




    The 2003 Regulation, per Article 19, made provision for the exchange of
    information between Member States in prescribed forms, contained in the
    Annexes.  The 2014 Regulation introduced, via  Article  1(12)  and  its
    Annexes, more detailed regulation of  this  discrete  subject.   Within
    Annex II, List A, there is a section entitled "Means  of  Proof"  which
    provides:


           "I. Process of determining the State responsible for examining
           an application for international protection


           1. Presence of a family member, relative or relation (father,
           mother, child, sibling, aunt, uncle, grandparent, adult
           responsible for a child, guardian) of an applicant who is an
           unaccompanied minor (Article 8)


           Probative evidence


           - written confirmation of the information by the other Member
           State;
           - extracts from registers;
           - residence permits issued to the family member;
           - evidence that the persons are related, if available;
           failing this, and if necessary, a DNA or blood test."


           [Our emphasis]

    This  latter  provision  resonates  in  the  context  of  the   present
    challenge.




    HRA 1998 and the Charter of Fundamental Rights

20) The governing legal framework also contains a human  rights  dimension.
    Section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, which makes it unlawful  for
    any public authority to act in a manner incompatible with a  Convention
    right, applies to the Secretary of State.  One of the Convention rights
    embraced by section 6 is Article 8 ECHR which establishes the right  to
    respect for private and family life in the following terms:

           "1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family
           life, his home and his correspondence.


           2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
           exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with  the
           law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
           national security, public safety or the  economic  wellbeing  of
           the country, for the prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the
           protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the
           rights and freedoms of others."



    The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the "Charter")
    is also engaged, having regard to Article 51 thereof.   The  Applicants
    invoke, firstly, Article 7, which provides:


           "Everyone has the right to respect for his or  her  private  and
           family life, home and communications."









    Reliance is also placed on Article 24(2):

           "In all actions relating to children, whether  taken  by  public
           authorities or private institutions, the child's best  interests
           must be a primary consideration."


    Article 24(3) is also of some significance:

           "Every child shall have the right to maintain on a regular basis
           a personal relationship and direct contact with both his or  her
           parents, unless that is contrary to his or her interests."

    The Applicants further invoke Article 47 which provides, in part:

           "Everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the
           Union are violated as the right to an effective remedy before  a
           Tribunal in compliance with the conditions  laid  down  in  this
           Article."


    UNCRC

21) Article 8 ECHR and Articles 7 and 24 of the Charter do not exist  in  a
    vacuum.  Rather, they  form  part  of  a  broader  international  legal
    framework which includes the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
    the Child ("UNCRC").  This includes in its preamble the following:

           "The States Parties to the present Convention ....


           Convinced that the family, as the fundamental group  of  society
           and the natural environment for the growth and well being of all
           its members and particularly children, should  be  afforded  the
           necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully  assume
           its responsibilities within the community, .....


           Recognising  that  the  child,  for  the  full  and   harmonious
           development of his or her  personality,  should  grow  up  in  a
           family environment, in an  atmosphere  of  happiness,  love  and
           understanding ....


           Bearing in mind that, as indicated in  the  Declaration  of  the
           Rights of the Child, 'the child, by reason of his  physical  and
           mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care,  including
           appropriate legal protection .....' ...."

      UNCRC,  while   more   prescriptive   and   comprehensive   than   its
      predecessors, was not revolutionary, its roots being readily traceable
      to the Geneva Declaration of  the  Rights  of  the  Child,  a  measure
      adopted by the League of Nations in  1924.    Article  3(1)  of  UNCRC
      provides:


           "In all  actions  concerning  children,  whether  undertaken  by
           public or private social welfare institutions,  courts  of  law,
           administrative  authorities  or  legislative  bodies,  the  best
           interests of the child shall be a primary consideration."

    The UN General Comment


22) Both UNCRC and, by logical extension, the various measures of  domestic
    and  international  law  rehearsed  above,  are  to  be  considered  in
    conjunction with a publication of the United Nations Committee  on  the
    Rights of the Children, namely "General Comment Number 14 (2013) on the
    Right of the Child to have his or her best interests taken as a primary
    consideration" (the "General Comment") promulgated in May  2013.   This
    emphasises, in its opening passages, that the  best  interests  of  the
    child have the threefold status of a right, a principle and "a rule  of
    procedure".  The essence of this rule  of  procedure  is  explained  in
    paragraph 6(3) in these terms:

           "Whenever a decision is to be made that will affect  a  specific
           child, an identified group of children or children  in  general,
           the decision making process must include an  evaluation  of  the
           possible impact (positive or negative) of the  decision  on  the
           child or children concerned.  Assessing and determining the best
           interests of the child require procedural guarantees."


      This theme is developed in paragraph 48  which,  under  the  title  of
      "Best Interests Assessment and Determination", states:


            "Assessing the child's best interests is a unique activity that
           should be undertaken in each individual case, in  the  light  of
           the specific circumstances of each child or group of children or
           children  in  general.  These  circumstances   relate   to   the
           individual characteristics of the child or  children  concerned,
           such as, inter alia, age, sex, level  of  maturity,  experience,
           belonging to a minority group, having  a  physical,  sensory  or
           intellectual disability, as well  as  the  social  and  cultural
           context in which the child or children find themselves, such  as
           the presence or absence of parents, whether the child lives with
           them, quality of the relationships between the child and his  or
           her family or caregivers, the environment in relation to safety,
           the existence of quality  alternative  means  available  to  the
           family, extended family or caregivers, etc."

    This is followed by  a  non-exhaustive  and  non-hierarchical  list  of
    factors to be included in a best interests assessment.

23) Section B of the General Comment is  devoted  to  the  subject  of  the
    procedural safeguards  required  to  guarantee  the  implication  of  a
    child's  best  interests.   These,  unsurprisingly,  are   not   unduly
    prescriptive.  Predictably, they emphasise  the  importance  of  (inter
    alia) "establishment of facts".  Paragraph 92, in this context, states:



           "Facts and information relevant to a  particular  case  must  be
           obtained by well trained professionals in order to draw  up  all
           the elements necessary for the best interests assessment.   This
           could involve interviewing persons close  to  the  child,  other
           people who are in contact with  the  child  on  a  daily  basis,
           witnesses to certain incidents among  others.   Information  and
           data gathered must be verified and analysed prior to being  used
           in the child's or children's' best interests assessment."

            [Emphasis added.]

    Paragraph  94,  in  similar  vein,  exhorts   the   deployment   of   a
    "multidisciplinary team of professionals"  -  who  may  hail  from  the
    spheres of child psychology, child development and other relevant human
    and social developments fields - in every best interests assessment.

24) In passing, in  the  municipal  law  context  of  the  United  Kingdom,
    comparable duties and requirements have been recognised for some  time,
    via the domestic law equivalent of Article 3(1) of UNCRC, section 55(1)
    of the Borders, Citizens and Immigration Act 2009 and the Secretary  of
    State's statutory guidance made under section 55(2).  The  requirements
    and duties thereby established have been  recognised  in  a  number  of
    reported cases.  These include the decisions of the Supreme Court in ZH
    (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 2 AC 166
    at [34] - [37] especially (per Baroness Hale) and the fifth  and  sixth
    of the precepts in  the  code  devised  by  Lord  Hodge  in  Zoumbas  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] 1 WLR 3690  at  [10].
    These decisions prompted  this  Tribunal  to  hold  in  JO  and  Others
    (Section 55 Duty) Nigeria [2014] UKUT 00517 (IAC) that being adequately
    informed  and  conducting  a  scrupulous  analysis  of   all   relevant
    information and factors are  essential  pre-requisites  to  the  inter-
    related tasks of  identifying  the  child's  best  interests  and  then
    balancing them with other material considerations.   We are mindful, of
    course, that section 55 does not apply to the present  context  as  the
    two children concerned, IK and HK, are outside the United Kingdom.

25) In R (SG) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  [2015]  UKSC  16,
    Lord  Carnwath  described  the  General   Comment   as   "authoritative
    guidance": see [105] - [106].  The unmistakable correlation between the
    substantive right and the procedural  duty  is  particularly  clear  in
    another decision of the Supreme Court, Mathieson v Secretary  of  State
    for Work and Pensions [2015] UKSC 47, at [41] especially.  The decision
    in Mathieson also serves as a reminder that Convention  rights  do  not
    belong to a vacuum but must be  interpreted  in  harmony  with  general
    principles of international law, a long familiar pronouncement  of  the
    ECtHR: see [42].

26) As a perusal of the jurisprudence considered  above  makes  clear,  the
    hallowed "Tameside" principle also has its place in the governing legal
    framework, above all when one is applying  a  pure  public  law  prism.
    This, again by analogy, was noted by this Tribunal  in  JO  and  Others
    (Nigeria), at [10]:

                "The passages highlighted above seem to me  to  support  the
           proposition that in  order  to  discharge  the  twofold,  inter-
           related duties imposed by section 55 (i) to have regard  to  the
           need to safeguard  and  promote  the  welfare  of  any  children
           involved in the factual matrix in  question  and  (ii)  to  have
           regard to the Secretary of State's guidance, the decision  maker
           must be properly informed.   I  consider  this  construction  of
           section 55 to be dictated by its content, its evident underlying
           purpose, the aforementioned decisions of the Supreme  Court  and
           the well established public law  duty  to  have  regard  to  all
           material considerations. The  outworkings of this discrete  duty
           were expounded  by  Lord  Diplock  in  Secretary  of  State  for
           Education and Science v Metropolitan Borough Council of Tameside
           [1977] AC 1014, at 1065b, in a  passage  which  has   particular
           resonance in the context of section 55:


                   "......  It is for a court of law to determine whether it
                   has  been  established  that  in  reaching  his  decision
                   ............  [the  Secretary  of  State]  had   directed
                   himself properly in law and had in consequence taken into
                   consideration   the   matters   which   upon   the   true
                   construction of the Act he ought to have  considered  and
                   excluded  from  his  consideration  matters   that   were
                   irrelevant to what he had to consider .....


                   Or, put more compendiously, the question for the court is
                   did the Secretary of State ask himself the right question
                   and take reasonable steps to acquaint  himself  with  the
                   relevant  information  to  enable  him   to   answer   it
                   correctly?"


                 Linked to this is another hallowed principle of public law,
           namely the duty of the public authority concerned to promote the
           policy and objects of the Act in giving effect to  the  relevant
           power or duty : Padfield v Minister  of  Agriculture,  Fisheries
           and Food [1968] AC 997, at 1030b/d per Lord Reid.  This  overlay
           of public law duties, when applied to section 55,  should  serve
           to ensure fulfilment of the underlying  legislative  purpose  in
           every case.   These  principles  also  give  sustenance  to  the
           proposition that the duties enshrined in section  55  cannot  be
           properly performed by decision makers in an  uninformed  vacuum.
           Rather,  the  decision  maker  must  be  properly  equipped   by
           possession of a sufficiency of relevant information."

    The Tameside duty has also been described from time to time as  a  duty
    of enquiry.  This duty resonates strongly, in the specific context of a
    child's best interests assessment, in the opinion of Baroness Hale in H
    (H) v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic [2013]  1  AC  338,  at
    [82] - [86].

27) The legal framework is completed  by the  series  of  legal  rules  and
    principles considered by this Tribunal in  its  recent  decision  in  R
    (ZAT) and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Article
    8 ECHR - Dublin  Regulation  -  Interface  -  Proportionality)    (IJR)
    [2016] UKUT 61 (IAC), at [36] - [39].  In brief compass:

      i) A state may have a positive obligation  under  Article  8  ECHR  to
         admit  persons  to  its  territory  in  order  to  achieve   family
         reunification: Sen v Netherlands [2003] 36 EHRR 7  and  Mayeka  and
         Mitunga v Belgium [2008] 46 EHRR 23, at [85] and [90] especially.


     ii) One of the purposes of the Refugee Convention  is  to  protect  and
         preserve the family unit of a refugee: ZN (Afghanistan) v Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2010] 1 WLR 1275, at [35].

    iii) It is incumbent  on  states  to  examine  applications  for  family
         reunion involving children with flexibility and humanity: Mugenzi v
         France (App 52701/09, 10 July 2014), at  [50]  -  [56]  especially.
         Notably the ECtHR emphasised the duty on the  national  authorities
         to  take  into  consideration  the  applicant's  vulnerability  and
         difficult personal history.

     iv) To like effect is the decision in Senigo-Longue & others  v  France
         (App 11903/09, 10 July 2014), at  [64]  -  [75]  especially,  where
         there is a notable emphasis on the procedural dimension of  Article
         8 ECHR at [63], also identifiable in the  undercurrent  of  [68]  -
         [69].  We would add that in both Mugenzi and  Senigo-Longue,  there
         are clear traces of Article 10 of UNCRC, which  provides  that  any
         application by a child or a child's parents to enter  a  state  for
         the purpose of family reunification "...  shall be  dealt  with  by
         States Parties in a positive, humane and  expeditious  manner"  and
         the linked provision in Article 22. The  latter  provision  clearly
         contemplates that the vindication of a  child's  procedural  rights
         under Article  8  ECHR,  in  the  conduct  of  the  best  interests
         assessment, for example, shall require appropriate proactive  steps
         on the part of the state concerned.

      v) The vulnerability of an asylum seeking  or  refugee  child  carries
         significant weight and may require special measures  to  be  taken:
         Tarakhel v Switzerland  [2015]  60  EHRR  28,  at  [99]  and  [119]
         especially.


The Battle Lines Drawn

28) The primary contention of Ms Kilroy, appearing with Ms Knorr on  behalf
    of the Applicants, is that the Secretary of State is under  a  positive
    legal duty to admit IK and HK to the United Kingdom for the purpose  of
    reunification with MK and the other children of the family.  Ms  Kilroy
    submits  that  the  Secretary  of  State's  rejection  of  the   French
    authority's "take charge" request in respect of IK and HK  is  vitiated
    by her failure to discharge the investigative  and  evidence  gathering
    obligations  deriving  from  the  various  instruments  and  principles
    outlined in [14] - [23] above.  This failure, it is argued, gives  rise
    to a breach of the three Applicants' rights under Article  8  ECHR  and
    Article 7  of  the  Charter.   Breaches  of  both  the  procedural  and
    substantive dimensions of Article  8  are  asserted.   The  fundamental
    default on the part of the Secretary of State of which  the  Applicants
    complain is her failure  to  properly  investigate  the  viability  and
    availability of IK and HK undergoing DNA testing in  the  circumstances
    in which they find themselves  in  France  and  given  that  all  three
    Applicants have consented to this procedure.

29) Acknowledging the evolution in the evidence which  has  occurred  since
    the Secretary of State's initial refusal decision was made,  Ms  Kilroy
    submits that this refusal cannot lawfully be maintained, having  regard
    to a combination of the evidence in its totality and the  Secretary  of
    State's entirely  passive  stance  regarding  the  acquisition  of  DNA
    evidence.  The Secretary of State has neither investigated this  issue,
    properly or at all, nor provided the Applicants with any assistance  to
    facilitate and expedite acquisition of the evidence.  Relying on R (Al-
    Sweady) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] HRLR 2,  Ms
    Kilroy submits, in terms, that this Tribunal is obliged to examine  all
    the evidence with appropriate scrutiny given the  procedural  dimension
    of the rights invoked by the Applicants, is entitled to differ from the
    Secretary of State's assessment that there is insufficient evidence  of
    family ties linking the three Applicants  and,  having  conducted  this
    exercise, should make findings sufficient to warrant the grant  of  the
    primary relief sought by  the  Applicants,  namely  a  mandatory  order
    requiring the Secretary of State to admit  IK  and  HK  to  the  United
    Kingdom.

30) This Tribunal, it is further contended, should find that IK and HK  are
    the biological children of MK.   It  is  submitted  that  this  is  the
    appropriate finding having regard to  the  totality  of  the  evidence,
    coupled with a series of factors: in particular,  the  absence  of  any
    adverse credibility issue in the Secretary of  State's  decisions;  the
    positive credibility assessment implicit in MK's successful  claim  for
    asylum in 2010;  the Applicants' consistent willingness  to  submit  to
    DNA testing; the repeated daily contact involving all three  Applicants
    during recent months; and, finally, the very fact of these  proceedings
    and the course which they have taken.

31) Ms Kilroy's alternative contention is that, given the breaches of legal
    duty on the part of the Secretary of  State  which,  it  is  said,  are
    established, the Tribunal should, as a minimum, grant relief in a  form
    which will require the Secretary of State to take appropriate steps  to
    remedy the evidential void - namely the absence of DNA testing  reports
    - which is the only obstacle preventing the reunification of IK and  HK
    with their  mother  MK  and  their  siblings  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Finally, highlighting the pure public law dimension of this  challenge,
    Ms Kilroy submits that  the  Secretary  of  State  has,  unsustainably,
    attributed no weight to the French authority's "take  charge"  request,
    has erred and misdirected herself in law  in  suggesting  that  in  the
    circumstances prevailing  her  function  is  merely  passive;  and,  in
    contravention of the "Tameside"  principle,  has  both  failed  to  ask
    herself the correct question - namely what are the best interests of IK
    and HK - and has also failed in her duty of enquiry.

32) Turning to the Secretary of State's case, we note the combined detailed
    grounds of defence and skeleton argument of  Mr  Keith.   The  asserted
    breaches of Article 8 ECHR, Article 7 of the Charter and  the  relevant
    provisions of the Dublin Regulation are all resisted on the ground that
    there was insufficient evidence to establish  a  familial  relationship
    among the three Applicants.  Attention is also drawn to the  manner  in
    which MK's account has evolved and (it is contended) altered  beginning
    with her asylum interview in 2010 and extending through her  successive
    witness  statements  in  these  proceedings.   Inconsistencies  in  the
    witness statements of two of  the  children  of  the  family  are  also
    asserted.  Further, it is suggested that  the  French  authorities,  in
    making the "take charge" requests, did not have  access  to  MK's  2010
    asylum interview.

33) The basis upon  which  the  Secretary  of  State  takes  her  stand  is
    particularly clear from  the  following  passages  in  the  grounds  of
    defence:

           "It is a matter for the Applicants should they wish to have  DNA
           tests conducted.  In any event, the Respondent does not  require
           DNA evidence to be  submitted  in  order  to  prove  a  familial
           relationship under the [Dublin Regulation] or in support of visa
           applications ....


           In this case the take charge request has  been  refused  on  the
           basis of credibility."


      The grounds of defence also seek to draw support from  Article  22  of
      the Dublin Regulation (reproduced  in  [17]  supra).   The  contention
      advanced is based exclusively on  Article  22(5),  which  obliges  the
      requested Member  State  to  acknowledge  its  responsibility  if  the
      circumstantial evidence  is  "coherent,  verifiable  and  sufficiently
      detailed to establish responsibility".   The contention formulated  is
      the following:


           "Therefore, it is not incumbent on the requested Member State to
           seek out evidence but rather to consider that which is in  front
           of it."




      This may be linked to a later passage in the grounds:


           "The Respondent is not  required  to  actively  investigate  the
           claim under the Dublin  Regulation,  it  being  the  Applicants'
           application to  make  and,  therefore,  their  role  to  provide
           evidence that they are in fact mother and children from the same
           family."


    The impugned  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  is,  ultimately,
    justified on two bases.  First,  it  is  contended  that  it  does  not
    infringe Article 8 of the Dublin Regulation.  Second, it  is  contended
    that the decision is reasonable (presumably in the Wednesbury sense).


34) In the course of his submissions, Mr Keith was disposed to accept  that
    one of the options available to the Secretary of State  has  been,  and
    remains, to admit IK and HK to the United Kingdom for the sole  purpose
    of  undergoing  DNA  testing.   This,  however,  he  argued,  would  be
    undesirable as it  would  establish  a  dangerous  precedent.   It  was
    further submitted that the Secretary of State  could  not  enforce  any
    mandatory order requiring DNA testing of IK and HK in France.  Mr Keith
    acknowledged the inconclusive nature of the evidence of French  law  in
    this respect.  Finally, Mr Keith accepted that the Secretary of  State,
    upon receipt of the "take charge" request, had a duty under the  Dublin
    Regulation to investigate.  His associated submission  was  that  since
    the initial refusal decision was made there has been no continuing duty
    of this nature.


Our Conclusions

35) As the rï¿½sumï¿½ in [2] - [9]  above  indicates,  there  have  been  three
    separate decision making processes altogether involving  the  Secretary
    of State.  These have yielded three discrete decisions of the Secretary
    of State, namely the initial refusal to accede  to  the  "take  charge"
    request of the French authorities, the subsequent affirmation  of  such
    decision following a reconsideration request by the French  authorities
    and, ultimately, a second  reconsideration  decision  prompted  by  the
    further evidence accumulated by the Applicants in the context of  these
    proceedings.  All three decisions have been to like effect and each has
    had the same rationale.

36) The available evidence points readily to the threefold conclusion  that
    the Secretary of State has at no time (a) investigated, in  conjunction
    with the French authorities or otherwise, the viability or availability
    of DNA testing for IK and HK  in  France,  (b)  investigated  what  the
    relevant French domestic laws are in this respect or (c) considered the
    possibility of admitting IK and  HK  to  the  United  Kingdom  for  the
    purpose of carrying out DNA testing.  We consider that  these  are  all
    material considerations, none of which has  been  taken  into  account.
    This analysis is reinforced when one superimposes the  "Tameside"  duty
    of enquiry.  It follows that, viewed through a pure public  law  prism,
    the Secretary of State's initial and subsequent decisions are unlawful.



37) This is not, however, the only dimension from which the legality of the
    Secretary of State's rejection of the "take charge" request  is  to  be
    evaluated.  As the outline in [14] - [27] shows,  the  governing  legal
    framework has multiple constituent elements, many of them interlocking.
     The analysis that the dominant instrument in this legal matrix is  the
    Dublin Regulation seems to us uncontroversial.  In  contrast  with  the
    situation prevailing in ZAT, the processes and procedures of the Dublin
    Regulation had been fully observed in the present case.  In summary, IK
    and HK made their respective claims for asylum in France, these  claims
    were examined by the French authorities, a "take charge" request ensued
    and the Secretary of State made her refusal  decision  accordingly  and
    reaffirmed it subsequently.  The contrast with  ZAT,  where  no  Dublin
    Regulation steps had been taken, is striking.

38)  We  consider  that  duties  of  enquiry,  investigation  and  evidence
    gathering course through the veins of the  Dublin  Regulation  and  its
    sister instrument, the 2003 Regulation as  amended.   In  some  of  the
    provisions of the Dublin Regulation, these duties are explicit: see for
    example Article 6(4) and Article 8(2).  These duties are also  explicit
    in Article 22(1), which requires a requested Member State to "make  the
    necessary checks" upon receipt of a  "take  charge"  request  prior  to
    reaching its decision.  In other provisions of the  Dublin  Regulation,
    these duties are clearly implicit.  The scheme of the Dublin Regulation
    is that the more detailed outworkings of these duties are not specified
    in the measure itself but are, rather, to be found  in  the  ancillary,
    implementing legislation adopted by the  Commission,  namely  the  2003
    Regulation as amended. These two measures must be  considered  together
    and as a whole.

39) It follows that we reject  the  Secretary  of  State's  contention  (as
    pleaded) that she had no duty of  investigation  upon  receipt  of  the
    "take charge" requests and the associated contention that the  onus  to
    provide  all  necessary  evidence  rested  on  the  Applicants.   These
    contentions are, in our judgment, confounded by the provisions  of  the
    Dublin Regulation and its sister instrument considered as a  whole.  We
    further reject the Secretary of State's selective reliance  on  one  of
    the various components of Article 22,  namely  Article  22(5),  of  the
    Dublin Regulation, for the same reason.

40) We must now consider the Secretary of State's modified position at this
    stage of the hearing. This entailed an acknowledgement that there was a
    duty of investigation under the  Dublin  Regulation  when  the  initial
    "take charge" request was received.  What did this duty require of  the
    Secretary of State?  We consider that the  investigative  and  evidence
    gathering duties imposed on Member States by the Dublin Regulation  are
    unavoidably factually and  contextually  sensitive.   The  content  and
    scope of such duties will vary from one context to another.   While  we
    did not receive detailed  argument  on  this  discrete  issue,  we  are
    inclined to the view that these duties are not absolute, in  the  sense
    that they apply irrespective of considerations  such  as  excessive  or
    disproportionate burden. It seems to us that  implicit  in  the  Dublin
    Regulation is the principle that these duties require the Member  State
    concerned to take reasonable steps.  The court  or  tribunal  concerned
    will, having regard to its duty under Article 6 TEU, be the arbiter  of
    whether this duty has been acquitted in any given case.

41) We  find  nothing  in  either  the  Dublin  Regulation  or  its  sister
    instrument to support  the  argument  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    acknowledged duty of investigation was extinguished  once  the  initial
    refusal decision had been made.  There is nothing  in  this  regime  to
    suggest that a decision on a "take charge"  request  is  in  all  cases
    final and conclusive, subject only  to  legal  challenge  under  (inter
    alia) Article 27.  Furthermore, this  would  be  entirely  inconsistent
    with the concept of practical and effective protection and the  broader
    context of the real world of asylum claims.  The phenomenon of  renewed
    "take charge" requests and successive "take charge"  decisions  by  the
    requested State is, in our view, implicitly recognised  in  the  Dublin
    Regulation.  Furthermore, it was not  argued   that  the  Secretary  of
    State's reconsidered decision, made pursuant to a renewed "take charge"
    request, was in some way a voluntary act of grace,  as opposed  to  the
    discharge of a decision making  duty.   Nor  was  it  argued  that  the
    Secretary of State's later decisions,  made  in  the  course  of  these
    proceedings, were in some  way  divorced  from  the  Dublin  Regulation
    context.

42) The present cases are a paradigm illustration of the  truism  that,  in
    certain contexts, there may be a  series  of  formal  requests  by  one
    Member State and a series of formal decisions by the  requested  Member
    State.  We are in no doubt  that  all  such  decisions  and  associated
    decision making processes are governed by the Dublin Regulation and its
    sister instrument, the 2003 Regulation as amended.

43) We have identified in [36] above three failures  on  the  part  of  the
    Secretary of State in making the principal decision, namely the refusal
    of the initial "take charge" request by the  French  authorities.   All
    are, in essence, failures of a procedural nature.  The conclusion  that
    these failures, individually or collectively, amount to a breach of the
    investigative and evidence  gathering  duties  imposed  by  the  Dublin
    Regulation does not, however, follow inexorably.  This  question  must,
    rather, be answered by reference to the context in which  the  failures
    occurred.

44) At its most basic and material,  this  context  was  possessed  of  two
    conspicuous features.  The  first  was  the  absence  of  DNA  evidence
    establishing that all three Applicants are,  biologically,  members  of
    the same family.  The second is the acknowledgement on the part of  the
    Secretary of State that if evidence of this  kind  were  available  the
    "take charge" requests would be accepted.  In our judgment this context
    obliged the Secretary of State as a minimum,  to  take  the  procedural
    steps and properly consider the options identified in [36] above.   The
    Secretary of State did not do so.  We conclude  that,  in  consequence,
    the investigative and evidence  gathering  duties,  both  explicit  and
    implicit, in Articles 6 and 8 of the Dublin Regulation,  considered  in
    tandem with the 2003 Regulation as amended, were not  discharged.   The
    corresponding rights of the Applicants were infringed.   The  principal
    decision of the Secretary of State is,  therefore,  in  breach  of  the
    Dublin Regulation.

45) We elaborate on  this  conclusion  as  follows.   The  absence  of  DNA
    evidence establishing the requisite biological familial  link  was  the
    crucial feature of the Secretary of State's decision.   No  alternative
    hypothesis - such as sophisticated invention or manipulation - has ever
    been postulated.  The key to breaking the logjam was DNA evidence:  but
    none was  available.   The  Applicants  were  unable  to  provide  such
    evidence for a variety of reasons,  including  in  particular  lack  of
    resources and uncertainties relating to French law.  The  Secretary  of
    State was at all material times in a position to proactively take steps
    to at least attempt to overcome this impasse.   However,  the  evidence
    establishes beyond peradventure that nothing was done.  In  particular,
    none of the elementary steps identified in [36] above was  taken.   The
    Applicants were in a  position  of  helpless  and  hopeless  impotency.
    Relying upon a mistaken assessment that she was entitled, in law, to be
    purely passive and a further  erroneous  view  of  onus  of  proof  the
    Secretary of  State  proceeded  to  make  a  decision  adverse  to  the
    Applicants of fundamental significance to  their  lives.   We  consider
    these failures to be incompatible with the progressively  strengthening
    mechanisms and provisions contained in the current incarnation  of  the
    Dublin Regulation, reflected  particularly  in  the  investigative  and
    evidence gathering duties identified above and the  new  (and  welcome)
    emphasis on protecting children and families.

46) The analysis above must, logically, apply fully to the second and third
    of the Secretary of State's decisions.  Furthermore, it impels  to  the
    further conclusion that all of these decisions are  in  breach  of  the
    both the Dublin Regulation and the procedural dimension  of  Article  8
    ECHR.

47) We further consider that, in the fact sensitive context of  this  case,
    the Secretary of State's investigative and  evidence  gathering  duties
    are continuing.  This follows logically from our  analysis  that  these
    duties were not properly discharged in the context of any of the  three
    decision  making  processes  which  have  occurred,  coupled  with  our
    conclusion that the Dublin  Regulation  has  continued  to  govern  the
    relationship between the parties since the initial decision was made.

48) The due discharge of the Secretary of State's  duties,  once  effected,
    will, inter alia, illuminate the relevant provisions of domestic French
    law which, at this stage, remain an incognito. What is  clear  is  that
    there is, at present, no compelling evidence of any  insuperable  legal
    obstacle. In passing, it would seem unlikely that French law  enshrines
    an absolute prohibition against the DNA testing of IK  and  HK,  taking
    into account the twin factors of their consent to this being  done  and
    the specific recognition of this measure in an instrument of supreme EU
    law, namely the 2003 Regulation.  Beyond this limited observation we do
    not venture.


Remedy

49) The primary remedy sought on behalf of the Applicants  is  a  mandatory
    order requiring the Secretary of State to admit IK and HK to the United
    Kingdom, for the purpose of family reunification.  The basis upon which
    Ms Kilroy urged this remedy requires careful consideration.   It  would
    involve this Tribunal in the twofold exercise of (a) conducting its own
    detailed examination of all available evidence and (b) making  findings
    that such evidence is sufficient to establish that IK and  HK  are  the
    biological children of MK.  The Tribunal was invited  to,  inter  alia,
    conduct  a  microscopic  examination  of  the  photographic   evidence.
    Furthermore, the findings which the Tribunal has  been  urged  to  make
    would be based not insubstantially on a series  of  witness  statements
    rather than viva voce evidence duly tested by cross examination.

50) To the above factors we add the consideration  that  the  Secretary  of
    State is the primary decision maker, coupled with our conclusion that a
    lawful decision making process and ensuing decision on the part of  the
    Secretary of State have not yet occurred, given the legal  deficiencies
    identified above.  Furthermore, we are in a position to fashion a swift
    and efficacious remedy.

51) We further take into account that, to date, the case of the  Applicants
    has proceeded via the route of the Dublin Regulation.   This  contrasts
    with ZAT, where this Tribunal stated, at [52]:

           "We consider that the Dublin Regulation, with its rationale  and
           overarching aims and principles, has the status  of  a  material
           consideration  of  undeniable  potency  in  the  proportionality
           balancing exercise.  It follows that vindication of an Article 8
           human rights challenge will require a strong and persuasive case
           on its merits.  Judges will not lightly find that,  in  a  given
           context,  Article  8  operates  in  a   manner   which   permits
           circumvention  of   the   Dublin   Regulation   procedures   and
           mechanisms, whether in whole or in part. We consider  that  such
           cases are likely to be rare."

    We are mindful of the very recent assessment of  the  Court  of  Appeal
    that the Dublin Regulation is a measure of elevated  importance.   Laws
    LJ stated, at [31]:


           "It  is  a  legal  instrument  of  major  importance   for   the
           distribution of responsibility among the Member States  for  the
           administration of asylum claims. If it were seen as establishing
           little more than a presumption as to  which  State  should  deal
           with which claim, its purpose would be critically undermined. In
           my judgment an especially compelling case under Article 8  would
           have to be demonstrated to deny removal of the  affected  person
           following a Dublin II decision."

    See R (CK Afghanistan and Others) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2016] EWCA Civ 166, at [31]. While CK  was  concerned  with
    the immediate  predecessor  of  the  current  Dublin  Regulation,  this
    passage applies with full force to  both  measures.  While  noting  the
    contrasting matrix of the present challenges, we draw attention to this
    since the potent reach of the  Dublin  Regulation  is  unthreatened  by
    these proceedings. Furthermore,  given  our  analysis  and  conclusions
    above, the framework of the Dublin Regulation continues to apply in the
    case of the Applicants.  Any suggestion that it has become exhausted is
    misconceived for the reasons we have given.

52) Balancing all of these factors we conclude,  in  the  exercise  of  our
    discretion, that the appropriate remedies are the following:

      i) An order  quashing  the  Secretary  of  State's  primary  decisions
         relating to IK and HK, both dated 12 February 2016.

     ii) An order quashing the Secretary of State's second decision relating
         to both IK and HK, dated 16 March 2016.

    iii) An order quashing the Secretary of State's third decision  relating
         to both IK and HK, dated 19 April 2016.

     iv) A mandatory order requiring the Secretary of State (a) to take  all
         reasonable steps and use her  best  endeavours  to  facilitate  and
         secure DNA testing of IK and HK and to communicate and liaise  with
         the appropriate French authorities in this exercise, which is to be
         completed not later than 31 May 2016 and  (b)  to  make  a  further
         decision thereafter by 14 June 2016.

    There shall be liberty to apply.

53) The quashing orders will have the effect of requiring the Secretary  of
    State to reconsider the impugned decisions and make fresh decisions and
    to do so in accordance with the analysis of the law set forth  in  this
    judgment and on the basis of all available evidence. The second of  the
    two remedies will oblige the Secretary  of  State  to  proactively  and
    expeditiously address the evidential lacuna which forms the centrepiece
    of all three decisions made to date.  We have considered it appropriate
    to impose the above time limits, which we consider  reasonable,  having
    regard to the protracted separation of the family members concerned and
    already accrued delays, taking into account also  one  of  the  central
    themes of the  Dublin  Regulation,  namely  efficient  and  expeditious
    decision making, which applies with particular force  in  the  case  of
    children.


Order

54) We order as follows:

      i) The Secretary of State's primary decisions, both dated 12  February
         2016, refusing the take charge request of  the  French  authorities
         under Council Regulation (EU) 604/2013 in respect of the second and
         third Applicants, IK and HK, are hereby quashed.


     ii) The Secretary of State's second  decision,  dated  16  March  2016,
         refusing again, following reconsideration,  the  said  take  charge
         request is hereby   quashed.


    iii) The Secretary of State's  third  decision,  dated  19  April  2016,
         maintaining the refusal of the said take charge request  is  hereby
         quashed.

    While only the decisions in (i) were formally challenged at the outset,
     Mr Keith, realistically, did not oppose the  further  quashing  orders
    and, in the interests of certainty  and  finality  and  reflecting  our
    conclusions, we grant these further remedies and permit  the  necessary
    amendment to  reflect this.

     iv) The Secretary of State shall (a) take all reasonable steps and  use
         her best endeavours to facilitate and secure the DNA testing of the
         second and third Applicants and shall  liaise  and  communicate  as
         appropriate with the relevant French authorities in this  exercise,
         which must be completed by 31 May  2016  and  (b)  make  a  further
         decision by 14 June 2016.

      v) The Applicants' application to rely on further evidence is granted.




     vi) The anonymity of all three Applicants is maintained.


    vii) The Respondent shall pay the Applicants'  reasonable  costs  to  be
         assessed if not agreed.


   viii) The Applicants'  publicly  funded  costs  shall  be  subject  to  a
         detailed assessment.


     ix)  Liberty to apply.


       For the avoidance of any doubt, this order takes effect today.

            Signed:         Bernard  McCloskey


                       The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey
                 President of the Upper Tribunal
                 Immigration and Asylum Chamber


        Dated:    29 April 2016
