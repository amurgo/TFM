For the Appellant:     No representative (Mrs Michelle Simsek attended as
sponsor)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant in this matter is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.  For ease of reference I shall refer to the parties as  the
    claimant and the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department.   This
    matter comes before me for consideration as to whether or not there  is
    a material error of law in the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Davidge promulgated on 18 March 2014.

Background

2.   The claimant is  a  Turkish  national  who  appealed  the  respondent's
    decision dated 29  March  2013  in  which  his  application  for  entry
    clearance as the spouse of a British citizen was refused.

3.   The basis  of  the  refusal  was  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules because the  sponsor's  wages  of
    �11,802 per annum fell short of the  required  amount  of  �18,600  per
    annum as set out in the new Rules.  Her actual income was �16,562  plus
    child tax credit of �4,760 per year.

4.   The matter was reviewed by an Entry Clearance Manager under  Article  8
    ECHR who concluded that family life was not engaged because  there  was
    no evidence of family life between the claimant and his  British  child
    other than a two week visit at the time of his birth in 2012.   It  was
    considered that contact could be  continued  using  modern  methods  of
    communication and visits.

5.   The appeal was heard in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  where  the  sponsor
    attended  and  gave  oral  evidence.   The   findings   made   in   the
    determination at [16 ] are not challenged.  The Tribunal concluded that
    the  Immigration  Rules  were  not  met  because   of   the   financial
    requirements.  The Judge went on to consider Article 8 ECHR having  had
    regard to the principles of Gulshan in [21] to [23].   She  found  that
    there were arguable grounds for considering the appeal outside  of  the
    rules, primarily because in out-of-country cases there  is  no  express
    provision in the new rules which allows for an assessment of Article 8-
    type rights as encompassed in EX1.  In considering Article 8  ECHR  the
    judge followed the approach of Razgar and also  placed  weight  on  the
    decision made by Blake J in MM  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] EWHC  1900.   She  concluded  the  decision  was  not
    proportionate having regard to the financial requirements.

Grounds of Appeal

6.   The Secretary of State argued that the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
    law  by  allowing  the  appeal  under  Article  8  ECHR  and  that  the
    determination contained a material misdirection of law with  regard  to
    consideration of the guidance in Gulshan [2013] UKUT  00640  (IAC)  and
    Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin).  It was submitted that the outcome would
    not be considered to be "unjustifiably harsh".

7.   The Secretary of State also argued that Blake J in MM usurped the  role
    of the democratically accountable decision maker and that the  Tribunal
    in relying on MM erred in law.  Further the Tribunal was wrong to  rely
    upon MM as to the proportionality assessment as the Tribunal relied  on
    an unsafe authority whose conclusions cannot stand.


Permission to Appeal

8.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Coates granted permission  to  appeal  on  24
    April 2014.

Error of Law Hearing

9.   The sponsor attended the hearing  in  support  of  the  claimant.   The
    nature of the proceedings was explained to her  and  she  was  informed
    that she would be  able  to  address  the  Tribunal  having  heard  the
    submissions raised by the Secretary of State.

Submissions

10.  Mr Deller relied on the detailed grounds of appeal with regard  to  the
    two issues namely that the judge erred  by  failing  to  apply  Gulshan
    guidance and secondly,  wrongly  relied  on  MM  currently  awaiting  a
    decision by the Court of Appeal.  The judge failed to explain fully her
    application of MM and failed to have regard to recent jurisprudence  on
    Article 8 ECHR.

11.  Mrs Simsek responded  by  acknowledging  that  she  did  not  earn  the
    required income level but she had a small child and was  working  part-
    time.  If allowed to enter the UK her husband would be working and they
    would not be claiming tax credits and be able to pay their way  without
    recourse to public funds.

12.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Findings and Conclusions

13.  I find no material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's  decision.   I  am
    satisfied that she fully  engaged  with  the  relevant  issues  in  her
    detailed and well-reasoned determination.  She  correctly  applied  the
    Immigration Rules and concluded that the claimant was  unable  to  meet
    the financial requirements.  As regards Article 8 ECHR at paragraph  21
    she correctly considered the guidelines in Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new
    rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 and  clearly  set  out  her
    reasons why Gulshan is applicable.  She  found  that  there  were  good
    arguable grounds for consideration of the appeal outside of the  Rules.
    Specifically she highlighted the fact that  Appendix  FM  EX1  was  not
    applicable to out-of-country cases.  There  was  no  express  provision
    which allowed for the assessment of Article 8 rights including the best
    interests of the child, the unreasonableness of the sponsoring wife and
    the baby (both British citizens) having to relocate to  Turkey  shorter
    or in longer term.  As such these  factors  could  not  be  taken  into
    account.  She also found  that  the  availability  of  other  financial
    options such as from the claimant and support  of  third  parties  (the
    mother of the sponsor), in reducing the financial requirements  of  the
    family could not be factored in.  Accordingly I am satisfied that Judge
    Davidge has fully engaged with the guidance in Gulshan  and  find  that
    the factors  identified  are  capable  of  coming  within  criteria  as
    exceptional or compelling  to  justify  consideration  outside  of  the
    rules.  Whilst accepting that the Judge did not specifically  refer  to
    exceptional or compelling factors, I am satisfied that she engaged with
    those issues in her determination. The judge relied  on  the  sponsor's
    evidence having found her to be entirely credible.  Her  findings  with
    regard  to  relocation  are  set  out  in  paragraph   16(4)   of   the
    determination.  She found that the  sponsor  could  not  reasonably  be
    expected to relocate to Turkey because she has a significant and  well-
    established private life in  the  UK,  she  has  determinedly  obtained
    vocational qualifications,  established  a  career  which  is  socially
    useful in terms of care and support for the elderly.  She has permanent
    employment and has the benefit of significant childcare  and  financial
    support allowing her to enjoy and enhance her career.  I  am  satisfied
    that the judge has taken into account the circumstances  in  the  event
    that the sponsor and her child were required to relocate to Turkey  and
    having regard to all of those circumstances together with the  findings
    and conclusions and application  of  MM,  the  judge  has  in  my  view
    considered all of the principles to establish that she finds  there  to
    be unjustifiably harsh and/or compelling circumstances.  Insurmountable
    obstacles  concern  practical  possibilities  of   relocation   (MF   (
    Nigeria)v. Secretary of State for the Home dept [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192.
    and in the absence of the same if removal is to be disproportionate  it
    is necessary to show other nonstandard features that the  removal  will
    be unjustifiably harsh. (Nagre) The judge fully considered all  of  the
    evidence before her and I am satisfied that  her  conclusion  correctly
    following the Gulshan principles was open to her.

14.  Having regard to the application of MM, I am satisfied that  the  judge
    correctly and appropriately relied on  this  authority  notwithstanding
    that a Court of Appeal judgment is imminently expected.  Judge  Davidge
    dismissed the appeal on  immigration  grounds  with  reference  to  the
    claimant's failure to meet the financial requirements.  However,  I  am
    satisfied that in her assessment of  proportionality  under  Article  8
    ECHR she engaged in a balanced  assessment  of  the  interests  of  the
    individuals and of the  public  interest.   The  Tribunal  Judge  found
    proper reasons for finding that the interference was  disproportionate.
    She considered the extent to which the  claimant  failed  to  meet  the
    Rules, the omission of consideration  of  potential  earnings  for  the
    claimant and the evidence  as  to  available  savings  and  from  third
    parties.  She found that having regard to  all  of  those  matters  the
    potential annual income for the sponsor and the claimant would be  some
    �21,500, a figure reaching well over the requirement in the rules.  The
    judge  placed  weight  on  the  fact  that  this  is   a   longstanding
    relationship, the sponsor  and  child  are  British  citizens  and  the
    claimant's endeavours to develop family life with his child. In relying
    on MM the judge is endorsing the paragraphs of that judgment under  the
    heading justification of interference in [ 122 - 125] having regard  to
    the fact that the rights of British citizens who are low  wage  earners
    may be  frustrated by the Rules and having  regard  to  the  level  set
    which is below the  minimum  adult  wage.  In  such  circumstances  the
    removal  could  constitute  an   unjustifiable   and   disproportionate
    interference, as found by the Tribunal Judge in this instance.




Decision

15.  I dismiss the appeal.  The determination shall stand.
