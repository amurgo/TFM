Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Not present or represented

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent, Nadzeya Bliznets, was born on 6 August 1979  and  is  a
    female citizen of Belarus.  I shall hereafter refer to the appellant as
    the respondent to the respondent as the  appellant  (as  they  appeared
    respectfully before the First-tier Tribunal).  The  appellant  appealed
    against the respondent's decision dated 9 September 2014 to  refuse  to
    grant entry clearance to her as a visitor with a view to marriage.  The
    appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Birrell)  which,
    having considered the appeal on  the  papers  and  without  a  hearing,
    allowed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 14 May 2015.  The Entry
    Clearance Officer (Moscow) now appeals, with permission, to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The appellant's  representatives  (Henrys,  Solicitors)  had
    written to the Upper Tribunal to indicate that they  would  not  attend
    the hearing and that the appellant was happy for it to proceed  in  the
    absence of the sponsor and her United Kingdom representative.

 2. The judge had allowed the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.  The judge cited
    Mostapha (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015]  UKUT  112  (IAC).    In
    particular, the judge cited [23] of Mostapha:

         We have considered carefully the effect that  this  decision  could
         have in other cases. Plainly this will  mean  that  the  underlying
         merits of an application and the ability to satisfy the Immigration
         Rules, although not the question before the Tribunal may be capable
         of being a weighty factor in an appeal based on  human  rights  but
         they will not be determinative. They will only become  relevant  if
         the interference is such as to  engage  Article  8(1)  ECHR  and  a
         finding  by  the  Tribunal  that  an  appellant  does  satisfy  the
         requirements of the rules will not necessarily lead  to  a  finding
         that the decision to refuse entry clearance is disproportionate  to
         the proper purpose of enforcing immigration control. However it may
         be capable of being a strong reason for allowing  the  appeal  that
         must be weighed with the others facts in the case.

 3. At [26], the judge found:

         I have already found that Article 8(1) is engaged.  I consider that
         the appellant and Mr Scriven  [the  sponsor]  have  been  open  and
         honest in their engagement with the immigration process  and  tried
         to do things properly but have been let down in the  past  by  poor
         advice.  I am satisfied, contrary to the view of the ECO  and  ECM,
         that in fact the appellant did meet the necessary  requirements  of
         paragraph 56D for leave as a visitor with a view  to  marriage  and
         while this is of course, not an appeal against that  decision  that
         finding is, I am satisfied, a weighty factor  in  their  favour  in
         assessing proportionality.

 4. The appeal before Judge Birrell  was,  of  course,  not  an  appeal  in
    respect of paragraph 56D since there was a limited right of  appeal  in
    this instance in respect of human rights (Article 8) only.   The  judge
    acknowledged that fact at [12].  The judge also recorded [at  17]  that
    an application had been made and refused under Appendix FM as a partner
    because the appellant did not meet the definition of partner as she and
    the sponsor had not been living together for at least two  years.   The
    judge was satisfied that the appellant and sponsor were in  a  "serious
    relationship" [18].

 5. The judge refers more than once to "removal" as a factor in determining
    proportionality under Article 8, for example at [28]  ("In  determining
    whether the removal would be proportionate to  the  legitimate  aim  of
    immigration control ...").  As the grounds point out, there will be  no
    "removal" of the appellant as a  result  of  the  immigration  decision
    because she has been and will remain resident abroad.  The grounds also
    point out that the judge did not  consider  the  possibility  that  the
    appellant might apply to enter the United Kingdom as  a  fianc�e  under
    the Immigration Rules or, indeed,  marry  the  sponsor  in  Belarus  or
    elsewhere.  I note that the judge recorded [19] that "The  sponsor  can
    meet all the requirements for a spouse or fianc�e visa even if  one  of
    the children came with her ..." she also recorded in the same paragraph
    that:

         There appears to be no  issues  therefore  that  would  prevent  an
         application being made by the appellant for settlement if that  was
         what she wanted to do at this time and indeed it  was  put  to  the
         sponsor as a positive assertion in  cross-examination  that  if  he
         applied for the appellant to come as a spouse or fianc�e they could
         meet the Rules.

    However, rather than consider those possibilities (which  were  clearly
    raised before at the  hearing)  the  judge  simply  observed  that  the
    appellant could meet the requirements of paragraph  56D  for  leave  to
    enter as  a  visitor  with  a  view  to  marriage  and  then  made  the
    substantial leap from that finding concluding that the appeal should be
    allowed under Article 8 ECHR.  She found that "The  facts  underpinning
    the appellant's relationship with Mr Scriven a citizen  of  the  United
    Kingdom taken together where the legitimate purpose for the refusal  of
    entry clearance."  The judge appears to have considered that, given the
    appellant could meet the perhaps more stringent requirements for  entry
    as a spouse (if she were married to Mr Scriven) or as a fianc�e,  there
    was little or no public interest in denying her entry as a visitor with
    a view to marriage.  I do not agree with that reasoning.  The appellant
    chose to make an application for entry as a  visitor  with  a  view  to
    marriage and she only had a right of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    following refusal on human rights grounds.  There was  nothing,  in  my
    view, exceptional  about  the  circumstances  of  the  appellant.   Her
    circumstances are not rendered exceptional simply  by  her  ability  to
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules in a category  in  which
    she had not applied.  Furthermore, whilst her ability to meet paragraph
    56D  may  have  been  a  "weighty   factor"   her   circumstances   are
    characterised by an absence of any other weighty factors which demand a
    grant of entry clearance under  Article  8.   Indeed,  any  factors  in
    favour of the appellant are  counterbalanced  by  the  failure  of  the
    appellant and sponsor to consider  other  means  by  which  they  might
    pursue their family life together (living together or  married  abroad;
    application as a fianc�e or spouse).  I  agree  with  the  respondent's
    grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal that the judge has, in  effect,
    used Article 8 as a general dispensing power in the case  of  a  couple
    for whom she has felt sympathy and who she has considered should not be
    put to the cost of inconvenience by making  another  application  under
    the Immigration Rules.  By doing so, I find that the judge has erred in
    law.  Consequently, I set  aside  her  decision  and  have  remade  the
    decision dismissing the appeal on human rights grounds.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  was  promulgated  on  14  May
2015 is set aside.  I have remade  the  decision.   The  appellant's  appeal
against the decision of the ECO dated  9  September  2014  is  dismissed  on
human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.

Signed                              Date 10 November 2015
