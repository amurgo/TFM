For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, who  was  born  on  9th  March,
    1940.  She made application for leave to enter the United  Kingdom  for
    the purposes of settlement as the dependent adult mother  of  her  son,
    under paragraph 317 of Statement of Changes in  Immigration  Rules,  HC
    395 ("the Immigration Rules").

2.   The appellant's application was made on 10th  November,  2011  and  the
    sponsor, her son, is Mohammed Javed Iqbal.

3.   The application was refused on  30th  December,  2011.   The  appellant
    appealed the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer and at  a  hearing
    in North Shields on 12th October, 2012, First-tier Tribunal Judge  J  M
    Holmes dismissed the appellant's appeal,  both  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and on human rights grounds.

4.   The appellant challenged  the  judge's  determination  and  in  grounds
    submitted  by  someone  describing  themselves  as  "Chris  Boyle"   of
    Solicitors, Halliday Reeves, it was suggested  that  the  determination
    contained numerous errors of law.

5.   The first challenge, contained in paragraph 2 of the  grounds,  claimed
    that the judge failed to make clear  findings  on  whether  or  not  he
    agreed with the P60 evidence, or in the alternative that the First Tier
    Tribunal Judge "applied too high a standard of  proof"  in  failing  to
    accept such evidence.  The second challenge,  at  paragraph  3  of  the
    application, suggested that findings at paragraphs 36  and  37  of  the
    determination were unclear, and that  the  judge  had  failed  to  make
    reasoned or clear findings.  Paragraph 4 of  the  application  asserted
    that there were numerous receipts for money transfers which  the  judge
    had failed to have regard to and paragraph 5 suggested  that  paragraph
    42 of the determination was irrational and could not  "be  reasoned  if
    correct  weight  is  given  to  sizeable  financial  contributions  the
    appellant has made".

6.   In paragraph 6 of the grounds it was suggested that  the  Tribunal  had
    erred by discounting the P60 evidence of annual income over a period of
    two years  and  discounting  the  "sizeable  and  continuing  financial
    support provided by the sponsor to the appellant".  In paragraph  7  of
    the grounds it is suggested that the findings of paragraph  46  of  the
    determination are at odds with the record  of  the  evidence  heard  at
    paragraphs 44 and 45 of the determination, and that  the  Tribunal  had
    made irrational findings.

7.   Paragraph 9 of the grounds suggested that the judge had  erred  by  not
    accepting the evidence contained  within  "over  reaching  an  official
    documentation" in the form of P60s, (which are not  official  documents
    at all) and lastly it was  asserted  that  the  judge  gave  "incorrect
    weight" concerning smaller regular remittances sent by the sponsor.

8.   At the hearing before me Mr Selway told me that the grounds, which  had
    been submitted not by his firm, but by previous representatives, rather
    "overegged the issue".  I pointed out to him that the grounds of appeal
    appeared to have been signed by  "Chris Boyle", who  described  himself
    or herself as a "solicitor" with Halliday Reeves.

9.   Mr Selway told me that in respect of paragraph 4 of the  grounds  there
    were only two money transfers and in respect of  ground  5,  it  rather
    "overeggs the issue" because, there was no  evidence  of  any  sizeable
    financial contribution.  At paragraph 6 of the application,  again,  Mr
    Selway conceded, there was no evidence of any continuing  contributions
    before the First Tier Tribunal  Judge.   The  finding  referred  to  at
    paragraph 7 of the grounds was not,  Mr Selway told me, "irrational".

10.  The finding in the determination at paragraph 46, was not at odds  with
    the preceding two paragraphs, Mr Selway said.  The P60 produced by  the
    sponsor showed that the sponsor received just over  ï¿½2,000  per  annum,
    but if this were divided by 48 weeks, to ignore statutory holidays,  it
    showed, urged Mr Selway, that the sponsor was earning in excess of  the
    income support level.

11.  I pointed out Mr Selway that the parties had to eat for the other  four
    weeks of the year and he accepted  that  on  the  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal, the judge was entitled to conclude as he had.

12.  I asked Mr Selway if he could take me  to  any  error  of  law  in  the
    judge's determination and he told me he could not, and that he  was  in
    some difficulty.

13.  I told Mrs Pettersen that I did not wish to be addressed by her.

14.  It was quite properly conceded on behalf  of  the  appellant  that  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes did not  contain  any
    error on a point of law.


SUMMARY

     The making of the previous decision did not involve the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law
