For the Appellants:    Mr P Nathan instructed by Soma & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


1.   This matter was listed for a  Case  Management   Review  Hearing  which
    came before me on 8  July  2013.  It  was  common  ground  between  the
    representatives that the determination in each case was flawed  and  in
    accordance with the order of the Court of Appeal  of  the  13  February
    2013  both  cases  were   remitted   to   the   Upper   Tribunal    for
    redetermination after promulgated of the new country guidance.  It  was
    also common ground that the proper disposal of the appeals was  by  way
    of remittal to the First-tier  Tribunal  in  accordance  with  Practice
    Direction 17.2.

2.   I accordingly direct that these appeals be listed before  a  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge at Taylor House. They will be listed for  half a day and
    a Burmese interpreter will be required.






Signed                                  Date
