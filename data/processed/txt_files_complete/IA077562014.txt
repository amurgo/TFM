Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:          In person

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    I shall refer to the  parties  as  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
      Appellant is a citizen of India born on 21st October 1986. His  appeal
      against the Respondent's decision of 30th  January  2014  refusing  to
      vary leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and the decision to
      remove him to India under section 47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
      Nationality Act 2006 was allowed by the First-tier  Tribunal  on  20th
      May 2014. The Secretary of State appealed.



2.    The Appellant arrived in the UK on 30th December 2009  as  a  student
      with leave to enter until 30th November 2011. On 12th  December  2012,
      he was granted leave to remain as Tier 1 HS Post Study  Migrant  until
      12th December 2013. He applied for further leave to remain as a Tier 2
      (General) Migrant on 11th December 2013. His application  was  refused
      on 30th January 2014 on the grounds that his salary on his Certificate
      of Sponsorship [COS] was not at or above the appropriate rate for  the
      job.

3.    The Appellant's appeal against this decision was  allowed  by  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Moore on  the  basis  that  the  letter  from  the
      Appellant's employer dated 4th February 2014 showed that there was  an
      error on the COS as to the number of hours the Appellant worked.  This
      was an administrative error by the company and therefore the Appellant
      satisfied all the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

4.     Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Frankish on 11th June 2014 on the grounds that  the  Judge  failed  to
      properly direct himself following section 85A Nationality, Immigration
      and Asylum  [NIA]  Act  2002  and  wrongly  took  into  account  post-
      application evidence.

5.    Mr Duffy submitted that the Judge had allowed the appeal having  taken
      into account the employer's letter of 4th  February  2014,  which  was
      inadmissible under section 85A. The Appellant should have made a fresh
      application. The Judge had erred in law and  the  decision  should  be
      remade and the appeal dismissed.

6.    The Appellant submitted that there was an administrative error on  the
      COS. The Appellant's employer attended and apologised for  the  error.
      He stated that this was the first time the company had made a  Tier  2
      application and the Appellant was a valued employee. His working hours
      were 35 not 40 because his lunch hour was unpaid. This was clear  from
      the contract of employment submitted with the grounds of appeal.

7.    For the reasons set out below, I explained that the Judge  had  failed
      to properly apply section 85A and he was not  entitled  to  take  into
      account evidence which was not submitted  with  the  application:  the
      contract of employment and the letter dated 4th February 2014. On  the
      evidence before the Judge, the Appellant was  unable  to  satisfy  the
      Immigration Rules and the appeal should have been  dismissed.  It  was
      open to the Appellant to make a  fresh  application  and  submit  this
      evidence. Mr Duffy stated that the Appellant's  leave  would  continue
      for 28 days after the Upper Tribunal's  decision  and  that  he  would
      endeavour to return the Appellant's original documents to  enable  him
      to make a new application without delay.





8.    At paragraph 6 of the determination the Judge stated that  the  burden
      of proof was on the Appellant to show that the  Respondent's  decision
      was on the balance of probabilities against the weight of the evidence
      and that this had been judicially construed to allow  evidence  to  be
      adduced which as available to the  Appellant,  but  not  produced  the
      Respondent at the date of the decision. The significance of  the  date
      of the decision had been confirmed by section  85(5)(b)  of  the  2002
      Act.

9.    I find that the Judge misdirected himself in law. He failed  to  apply
      section 85A NIA Act 2002. The letter  from  the  Appellant's  employer
      dated 4th February 2014 post dated the decision of 30th January  2014.
      It was not evidence to which section 85A(4)  applied.  The  Judge  was
      therefore only entitled to consider evidence adduced by the  Appellant
      at the time of making the application. The Judge has erred in  law  in
      taking into account  the  letter  of  4th  February  2014,  which  was
      inadmissible under section 85A. The Respondent's appeal to  the  Upper
      Tribunal is allowed.

10.   The Appellant's contract of employment was submitted with the  grounds
      of appeal and was not before the Respondent at the time of making  the
      decision. Therefore, on the evidence submitted  at  the  time  of  the
      application the Appellant was working 40 hours per week and  was  paid
      ï¿½20,300 per annum. This was below the appropriate  job  rate  for  the
      post.

11.   I find that the Judge erred in law in allowing the appeal  under  the
      Immigration Rules and I set the decision, dated 20th May 2014,  aside.
      The Appellant's appeal against the refusal of leave  to  remain  as  a
      Tier 2 (General) Migrant is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.
