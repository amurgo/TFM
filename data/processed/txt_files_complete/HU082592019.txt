                       ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER - accra
                                                                  Respondent



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is a national of Ghana.  He appealed to a Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal against the Secretary of  State's  decision  of  27
    February 2019 refusing leave to enter the United Kingdom.

2.    The judge having dismissed the appeal, the appellant  sought  and  was
    granted permission to appeal on the basis of procedural unfairness  not
    taking into account relevant documents and error as to  the  burden  of
    proof applied by the judge.

3.    In a response to directions sent on  behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer on 6 September 2020 it was accepted  that  the  judge  had  not
    considered material evidence and accordingly it  was  agreed  that  the
    decision should be set aside and remitted for  redetermination  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

4.    I agree with the submission.  Accordingly this appeal  is  allowed  to
    the extent that it is remitted for a full rehearing by a Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal other than Judge Steer.

No anonymity direction is made.
