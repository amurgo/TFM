Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr Avery (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent: Mr Harding, Counsel, instructed by J McCarthy
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

         1. Whereas the respondent is the appealing party, I shall,  in  the
            interests  of  convenience  and   consistency,   replicate   the
            nomenclature of the decision at first instance.

         2. The Appellant, citizen of Nigeria,  was  born  on  February  10,
            1976. In September 2006 the appellant entered the United Kingdom
            as a visitor and should have left the United  Kingdom  by  April
            2007. He remained and in October 2012 he underwent a traditional
            marriage ceremony before marrying his partner  on  December  21,
            2013. He applied to remain under Section R-LTRP of  Appendix  FM
            relying on  Section  EX.1  of  that  Appendix.   The  respondent
            refused this application on  November  23,  2013  disputing  the
            appellant satisfied the relationship criteria and arguing  there
            were no insurmountable obstacles  to  removal.  He  also  issued
            removal directions under section 47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum
            and Nationality Act 2006.

         3. On December 17, 2013 the Appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier
            Tribunal under Section 82(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
            Act 2002 (hereinafter called the  2002  Act),  as  amended.  The
            matter came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Majid
            (hereinafter called "the FtTJ") on August 8, 2014 and he allowed
            the appeal after an oral hearing in a determination  promulgated
            on August 26, 2014.

         4. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on  September  2,  2014.
            Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
            Tribunal Colyer on October 7, 2014.  He found it arguable  there
            was an error of law because the FtTJ  had  failed  to  make  any
            substantive findings of fact and the determination  was  utterly
            inadequate.

         5. The matter came before  me  on  the  date  set  out  above.  The
            appellant was in attendance and represented by his counsel.

         6. The appellant had not filed a Rule 24 response.

SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR IN LAW

         7. Mr Avery submitted the determination was utterly inadequate  and
            adopted his grounds of appeal. There was no consideration of the
            evidence or any public interest consideration. The  FtTJ  failed
            to demonstrate that he knew what he was  considering.  The  FtTJ
            failed to address the suitability requirements set  out  in  the
            Immigration Rules with regard to the time  they  were  together.
            Whilst they were now married they had not been together for  two
            years and  the  respondent  had  disputed  the  extent  of  that
            relationship it was incumbent on the FtTJ to make a  finding  on
            the relationship and he had failed to do so. He had also  failed
            to have regard to the Immigration Act  2014  and  in  particular
            section 19 that introduced Section 117A-C of the 2002 Act.

         8.  Mr  Harding  accepted  the  determination  was  not  ideal  but
            submitted that the as this was an  appeal  governed  by  Section
            EX.1 of Appendix FM then the  FtTJ  was  merely  concerned  with
            whether there were insurmountable obstacles and section 117A and
            B of the 2002 Act were  not  a  material  consideration  if  the
            appeal was allowed  under  the  Rules.  He  allowed  the  appeal
            because  he  placed  great  weight   on   the   wife's   British
            citizenship, the fact  she  was  receiving  IVF  treatment,  the
            safety of the appellant's partner because of the Boko Haram  and
            Ebola problems. Whilst the  decision  was  not  perfect  it  was
            nevertheless open to him.

ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

         9. This was a respondent appeal and the main thrust of the  grounds
            was that the FtTJ failed to make any findings. I have  read  the
            determination  carefully  and  whilst  the  FtTJ  recounted  the
            appellant's case and submissions made on his behalf he failed to
            make any findings whatsoever on the issues that were before him.



        10.  In  particular,  the  respondent  raised  the  issue  of  their
            relationship  in  her   refusal   letter.   She   disputed   the
            relationship and he took issue with the appellant's claims about
            insurmountable obstacles. The refusal letter also addressed  the
            issue of paragraph 276ADE.

        11. The FtTJ made no findings about the respondent's concerns  about
            the relationship and did not consider any of the  issues  raised
            by the respondent in her refusal  letter.  The  FtTJ's  decision
            does not consider the application under the Rules in  any  shape
            or form but what the  FtTJ  did  was  to  embark  on  a  partial
            examination of article  8  jurisprudence.  No  findings  on  the
            material issues were undertaken and the  only  finding  exercise
            undertaken  was   an   assessment   of   whether   removal   was
            proportionate.

        12. Mr Harding argued today that a proportionality  examination  was
            unnecessary as the application was granted under  the  Rules  as
            evidenced by the FtTJ's finding at paragraph [28].

        13. I indicated in Court that I was  satisfied  there  had  been  an
            error made and I referred to the lack of findings and  an  issue
            over whether he was a qualifying person having regard to Section
            R-LTRP. It may well be that having  married  his  partner  under
            English law the two year partner rule is no  longer  a  relevant
            consideration but I am satisfied  that  the  FtTJ's  failure  to
            address any of the issues raised  at  the  hearing  and  in  the
            refusal letter means there has been an error in law.

        14.  Having  established  there  was  an  error  in  law  I  invited
            submissions  on  what  should  happen  to   the   appeal.   Both
            representatives agreed fresh oral evidence and findings would be
            necessary. I considered Part  3,  Section  7.1  to  7.3  of  the
            Practice Statement.

        15. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

    "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act
    2007 (proceedings on appeal to the Upper Tribunal) the  Upper  Tribunal
    finds that the making of the decision concerned involved the making  of
    an error on a point of law,  the  Upper  Tribunal  may  set  aside  the
    decision and, if it does so, must either remit the case to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2)(b)(i) or proceed (in accordance  with
    relevant Practice Directions) to re-make  the  decision  under  section
    12(2)(b)(ii).


    The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to  proceed  to  re-
    make the decision, instead of remitting  the  case  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½


      a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


      b) the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.


    Remaking rather than remitting will nevertheless constitute the  normal
    approach to determining appeals where an error of law is found, even if
    some further fact finding is necessary."


        16. In light of the Practice Direction I agreed the case  should  be
            remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be reheard on all matters
            including Appendix FM, paragraph  276ADE  and  article  8  ECHR.
            Consideration would also have to be given to the Immigration Act
            2014.

        17. No additional directions are needed as there is a full bundle on
            the court file.

        18. The parties should ensure compliance with any directions  issued
            in  light  of  the  fact  the  Tribunal  Procedure   (First-tier
            Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 will apply
            to this appeal from hereon.

Decision

        19. The making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
            involve the making of an error on a point of  law.  I  have  set
            aside the decision.

        20. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
            fresh appeal hearing under Section 12 of the  Tribunals,  Courts
            and Enforcement Act 2007.

        21. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
            2008  (as  amended)  the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity
            throughout these proceedings, unless and  until  a  tribunal  or
            court  directs  otherwise.  An  order  has  been  made  and   no
            application has been made to alter the position.
