Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Pinder (counsel) instructed by Polpitiya & Co,
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2.    This is the  appellant's  appeal  against  a  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Clarke, promulgated on 28 April 2015, in which he found  that
the appellant does not have a valid right of appeal.

Background

3.    The appellant was born on 24 April 1993. He is a Sri Lankan  national.


4.    On 16 October 2013 the appellant submitted an  application  for  leave
to remain in the UK. The appellant's existing leave to  remain  was  due  to
expire on 2 November 2013. On 4 December 2013 the  appellant  wrote  to  the
respondent explaining that his  biometric  information  had  been  submitted
with his application form as part of the package of documents sent with  the
parallel applications of his parents on the same date. On 11 March 2014  the
respondent wrote to the appellant  rejecting  his  application  as  invalid,
stating that  the  appellant  had  not  provided  biometric  information  to
support his application.

5.    The appellant tendered a notice of  appeal  against  the  respondent's
rejection of his application (dated 11 March 2014). In a  decision  dated  9
April 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge D Birrell found that  the  respondent's
decision of 11 March 2014 is not  an  immigration  decision  as  defined  in
section 82(2) of the  Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.  The
appellant's notice of appeal was rejected in terms of rule 9(1A)(b)  of  the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

6.    On 17 April 2014 the  appellant  submitted  a  fresh  application  for
leave to remain in the UK. On 19 May 2014 the  Secretary  of  State  refused
that application for leave to remain in the UK.

The Judge's Decision

7.     The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier
Tribunal Judge Clarke ("the Judge") found that the appellant did not have  a
valid right of appeal against the Respondent's decision.

8.    Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 02/06/2015 Judge  Robertson  gave
permission to appeal stating inter alia
    "... This issue should have been determined by the judge on its  merits
    pursuant to Basnet and he  should  not  have  simply  relied  on  Judge
    Birrell's decision on  9  April  as  determining  whether  or  not  the
    appellant had extant leave when the May  decision  was  appealed.  This
    ground is arguable for the  reasons  set  out  at  para  9(vi)  of  the
    grounds, applying  Ved  and  another(appealable  decisions;  permission
    applications; Basnet) [2014] UKUT 00150 (IAC)"

The Hearing

9.    Ms Pinder, counsel for the appellant took me through  the  history  of
the appellant's applications, and told me  that  the  respondent's  decision
had been made in error because the respondent did not  understand  that  the
appellant's biometric data had been submitted  timeously.  She  argued  that
although  FtTJ  Birrell's  decision  had   gone   without   challenge,   the
appellant's  position  was  protected  by  the  operation  of  s.3C  of  the
Immigration Act 1971. Because he had resubmitted his  application  17  April
2014  FtTJ  Birrell's  decision  (which  pre-dated   resubmission   of   the
application) is  irrelevant  and  the  principals  in  Basnet  (validity  of
application -  respondent)  [2012]  UKUT  00113(IAC)  and  Ved  and  another
(appealable decisions; permission applications; Basnet)  [2014]  UKUT  00150
(IAC). She urged me to allow the appeal and remit  the  case  to  the  First
Tier Tribunal, as no fact finding exercise had been undertaken.

10.   Ms Everett, for the respondent, told me that FtTJ  Birrell's  decision
was determinative of this case, and  that  the  Judge's  decision  does  not
contain a material error of law. She argued that the appellant  cannot  have
a right of appeal because his leave to remain in the UK had  expired  before
he submitted his application. She argued that  there  is  not  a  sufficient
link between the  application  dated  17  April  2014  and  the  application
submitted on 16 October 2013 for the appellant to enjoy  the  protection  of
s. 3C of the Immigration Act 1971. She urged me to dismiss  the  appeal  and
allow the Judge's decision to stand.

Analysis

11.    In  Basnet  (validity  of  application  -  respondent)  [2012]   UKUT
00113(IAC) the Tribunal held that (i) if  the  respondent  asserts  that  an
application (not an appeal) was not accompanied by a fee,  and  so  was  not
valid, the respondent has the onus of proof; (ii)  The  respondent's  system
of  processing  payments  with  postal  applications  risks   falling   into
procedural  unfairness,  unless  other  measures  are  adopted;  (iii)  When
notices of appeal raise issues about payment of the fee  and,  consequently,
the validity of the application and the appeal, Duty Judges  of  the  First-
tier  Tribunal  should  issue  directions  to  the  respondent  to   provide
information to determine whether an application was accompanied by the  fee.


12.   In Ved and another  (appealable  decisions;  permission  applications;
Basnet) [2014] UKUT 00150 (IAC) it was held that the findings of  the  Upper
Tribunal in Basnet (Validity of application - respondent) [2012] UKUT  00113
(IAC) depended upon there being an appealable  immigration  decision,  which
in that case can only have been a refusal to vary  leave  to  remain  within
section 82(2)(d) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.  The
Secretary of State's rejection of an application for  leave  as  invalid  is
not an immigration decision within section 82 of the 2002 Act and cannot  as
such be appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

13.   In R (on the application of Woodward) v SSHD [2015] EWHC  470  (Admin)
it was held that when an incorrect fee was paid the application was  invalid
under Reg 7 of the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations  2012.  It
did not therefore extend leave under section 3C of the 1971 Act.

14.   This case does not involve arguments concerning payments of fees.  The
respondent rejected  the  appellant's  application  because  the  respondent
could not trace the appellant's biometric information (even  though  it  had
been supplied). FtTJ Birrell's decision  dated  9  April  2014  brought  the
appellant's application  submitted  on  16  October  2013  to  an  end.  The
appellant chose not to challenge  that  decision.  Instead  he  submitted  a
fresh application on 17 April 2014.

15.   The relevant part of s.3C of  the  Immigration  Act  1971  is  in  the
following terms:-
         "3C Continuation of leave pending variation decision
         (1)      This section applies if-
             (a) a person who has limited leave to enter or remain  in  the
             United Kingdom applies to the Secretary of State for variation
             of the leave,
             (b) the application for variation is  made  before  the  leave
             expires, and
             (c) the leave expires without the  application  for  variation
             having been decided.
         (2)      The leave is extended by virtue of this section during any
         period when-
             (a) the application  for  variation  is  neither  decided  nor
             withdrawn,
             (b) an appeal under section 82(1) of the  Nationality,  Asylum
             and Immigration Act 2002 could be brought, while the appellant
             is  in  the  United  Kingdom  against  the  decision  on   the
             application for variation  (ignoring  any  possibility  of  an
             appeal out of time with permission), or
             (c) an  appeal  under  that  section  against  that  decision,
             brought while the appellant  is  in  the  United  Kingdom,  is
             pending (within the meaning of section 104 of that Act).
         (3)      Leave extended by virtue of this section  shall  lapse  if
         the applicant leaves the United Kingdom.
         (4)      A person may not make an application for variation of  his
         leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom while that leave  is
         extended by virtue of this section.
         (5)      But subsection (4) does not prevent the variation  of  the
         application mentioned in subsection (1)(a)."

16.   The application made by the  appellant  may  have  extended  leave  to
remain until FtTJ's Birrell's decision dated 9 April 2014. A further 8  days
passed until the appellant's fresh application was  submitted  on  17  April
2014.

17.   In JH (Zimbabawe) v SSHD (2009) EWCA Civ 78 the Appellant  incorrectly
applied for indefinite leave instead of  limited  leave  to  remain  as  the
spouse a  person  present  and  settled  here.   By  the  time  the  correct
application form was submitted her original leave to enter as a visitor  had
expired.  The  Court  of  Appeal  said  that,   although   the   Appellant's
application for indefinite leave was doomed to failure, it  was  nonetheless
a valid application which had the effect of extending her original leave  by
virtue of section 3C of the 1971 Act.  The later application was capable  of
being treated as a variation of the first application  even  though  it  was
for a different purpose and on a different form and even  though  the  later
application was not put forward as a variation of the first, nothing  having
been said or inferred about actually withdrawing  the  first.   It  was  not
accepted by the Court of Appeal that a variation could only arise where  the
later application was for the same purpose but with different details.

18.   It is the respondent's position that the appellant does  not  enjoy  a
right of appeal against the respondent's decision  because  the  application
was submitted after the appellant's leave to remain expired.  The  appellant
argues that the  application  of  17  April  2014  is  a  variation  of  the
application  originally  submitted  on  16  October  2013,  and   that   the
application of 16 October 2013 extended  leave  to  remain  because  of  the
operation of section 3C of the immigration act 1971.

19.   Between [16] and [28] the Judge carefully (and  accurately)  sets  out
the history of applications by the appellant.  At  [28]  &  [29]  the  Judge
records the submissions of counsel for the appellant, which were  driven  at
FtTJ Birrell's decision of 9  April  2014.  At  [31]  the  Judge  succinctly
focuses the determinative issue in this  case  -  which  is  that  the  only
possible interpretation of the history of applications is that  there  is  a
gap between FtTJ Birrell's decision on 9 April 2014 and  the  submission  of
the appellant's (second) application on 17 April 2014. The  Judge  concludes
that at the time of the second application the appellant did not have  leave
to remain in the UK. As the appellant did not have leave to  remain  in  the
UK on 17 April 2014 (when he submitted the application  which  lead  to  the
decision of 19 May 2014) then he does not have a right of appeal.

20.   If the appellant's leave to remain was extended by  submission  of  an
application on 16 October 2013, then that extension of leave to remain  came
to an end on 9 April 2014. There is a gap of  eight  days  between  9  April
2014 and 17 April 2014. During that period the appellant did not have  leave
to remain in  the  UK.  The  application  submitted  by  the  appellant  was
submitted after his leave to remain expired. He does not therefore  enjoy  a
right of appeal.

21.   On 11 March 2014 the respondent rejected the  appellant's  application
as invalid. There is a dispute between  the  appellant  and  the  respondent
about the quality of that decision. The appellant  still  insists  that  his
application contained all of  the  necessary  supporting  documents  and  so
should not have been rejected as invalid. The problem for the  appellant  is
that the decision of 11  March  2014,  which  rejected  the  application  as
invalid, has not been challenged and still  exists.  For  the  appellant  to
benefit from section 3C of the 1971 act he must submit a  valid  application
before leave expires.

22.   The undisputed evidence  before  me  indicates  that  the  appellant's
application submitted on 16 October 2013 is  an  invalid  application.  That
means that the appellants leave to remain expired on 2 November 2013.

23.   The appellant did  not  have  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  when  he
submitted  his  application  on  17  April  2014.  The  appellant  does  not
therefore have a right of appeal against the decision of 19  May  2014.  The
judge's decision does not contain a material error of law.

CONCLUSION

24.   I therefore find that no errors of law have been established and  that
the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

25.   The appeal is dismissed.
