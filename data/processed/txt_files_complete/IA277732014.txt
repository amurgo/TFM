Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance.
For the Respondent:    Mr. C. Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Kenya who appealed against  the  decision
    refusing him further leave as a Tier 4 Student.  The refusal was  dated
    12 June 2014.  The appellant, acting in person, appealed and  following
    a hearing at Birmingham on 20 October 2014 his appeal was dismissed  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Pacey in a decision promulgated on  24
    October 2014.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    McWilliam on 9 December 2014.  Her reasons for so doing are as follows:-



         "1.  This is an in-time application by the  appellant  against  the
             decision of Judge J Pacey to dismiss his  appeal  against  the
             decision of the respondent to grant him  leave  as  a  tier  4
             (general) student under the PBS.

         2.   The Judge dismissed the appeal  because  the  bank  statements
             submitted by the appellant showed that his  funds  fell  below
             the required amount of ï¿½1,600 during the 28 day period from 21
             March 2014 - 17 April 2014.

         3.   The  appellant  asserts  that  the  28  day  period  that  the
             respondent took into account was not  favourable  to  him.   I
             note from the bank statements in the respondent's bundle  that
             the appellant appears to have had the requisite funds  between
             28 February 2014  and  4  April  2014  and  the  date  of  his
             application was 26 April 2014 (within 31 days of the  4  April
             2014).

         4.   There is an arguable error of law."

 3. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 4. There was no appearance from the appellant.  I satisfied myself that he
    had been served with notice of hearing at the last known address  given
    to the Tribunal and accordingly decided to proceed with the  appeal  in
    his absence.

 5. Mr Avery submitted that there was no error whatsoever in Judge  Pacey's
    decision.

 6. Judge Pacey dismissed the appellant's appeal on the basis that the bank
    account had fallen below the required level for a period in April 2014.
     Permission to appeal was granted but the issue  now  is  clarified  in
    Appendix C to the Immigration Rules.  Appendix C1A(h) indicates the end
    dates of the 90 day or 28 day periods are defined, and they  are  taken
    as the date of the closing balance on the most recent  bank  statement.
    This is exactly as applied  by  Judge  Pacey  at  paragraph  7  of  her
    decision.  Accordingly there is no error of law in the judge's approach
    to the Immigration Rules.

Decision

 7. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

 8. I do not set aside the decision.

 9. No anonymity direction is made.



Signed                              Date         19 June 2015
