     Appellant

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
     Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr M Azmi (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant's appeal had been heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox
    in May 2019 and his appeal dismissed. That decision was set aside by
    the Upper Tribunal following a hearing before Deputy Upper Tribunal
    Judge Chamberlain in his decision promulgated on the 13th of September
    2019. The case was then listed for a re-hearing before me on the 2nd of
    December 2019.

 2. At the hearing it was agreed that it was more appropriate that with no
    findings preserved the appeal ought to have been remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal. Mr Mills stated that was what he had expected to happen
    and Mr Azmi did not object. In those circumstances the appeal is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing not before Judge Fox
    or Judge Chamberlain.



CONCLUSIONS

The decision is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing.



Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.)



Fee Award

In remitting the appeal this remains an issue for the First-tier Tribunal
dependent on the outcome of the appeal.
