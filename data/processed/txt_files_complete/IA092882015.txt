                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  M  Whitcombe)  allowing  on  human  rights
    grounds the respondent's appeal against a decision of the Secretary  of
    State made  on  23  February  2015  to  remove  the  respondent  as  an
    overstayer under s.10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

 2. The respondent who is a citizen of Pakistan  last  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on 23 October 2010.  He subsequently made  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain but that  was  refused  and  the  respondent
    overstayed.  On 29 September 2012, he made a human  rights  application
    relying upon Art 8.  On 17 September 2013, that application was refused
    with no right of appeal.

 3. On 16 December 2013, a judicial review claim was lodged and on 3  April
    2014 that claim was resolved by consent.  We were not  told  upon  what
    basis but, in any event, on 17  October  2014  further  representations
    were made which were treated by the  Secretary  of  State  as  a  fresh
    application for leave to remain.

 4. In response to that application, on 23 February 2015 the  Secretary  of
    State refused the respondent's claim based upon his private and  family
    life under the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) and Art 8  of  the
    ECHR and made a decision to remove him.  The  decision  to  refuse  the
    respondent's human rights' claim  was  certified  in  para  27  of  the
    decision  letter  as  "clearly  unfounded"   under   s.94(2)   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  ("NIA  Act  2002").   The
    notice of decision informed the respondent  that  he  had  a  right  of
    appeal but, as his Art 8 claim was certified  as  "clearly  unfounded",
    that right of appeal under s.82(1) of the NIA Act 2002  could  only  be
    exercised after he had left  the  UK.   Despite  that,  the  respondent
    whilst in-country lodged an appeal notice with the First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT").

 5. In his decision sent on 26 August 2015,  Judge  M  Whitcombe  concluded
    that, despite the certification under  s.94(2),  that  issue  had  been
    resolved by the prior judicial  review  proceedings  and  the  FtT  had
    jurisdiction to hear the appellant's in-country  appeal.   As  we  have
    indicated, the judge went on to allow the respondent's appeal under Art
    8.

 6. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on  the  basis  that
    the effect of the certification was that the respondent only had an out-
    of-country appeal and the FtT had no  jurisdiction  to  deal  with  the
    respondent's appeal in-country.

 7. On 8 January 2016, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Colyer)  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal. Thus, the appeal  came  before
    us.

 8. There is, in our judgment,  no  answer  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
    grounds of appeal.  There is no doubt that the respondent's decision of
    23 February 2015 included a certification  of  the  respondent's  human
    rights' claim as being "clearly unfounded" under s.94(2) of the NIA Act
    2002.  We were not shown the basis upon which the judicial review claim
    had been resolved on 3  April  2014  presumably  by  a  consent  order.
    However, whatever was the basis, it could not affect the  certification
    of the Art 8 claim which  was  decided  by  the  Secretary  of  State's
    subsequently in the letter  of  23  February  2015  and  which  was  in
    response to submissions made by the respondent on 17 October 2014 after
    the judicial review proceedings were concluded.   As a consequence, the
    respondent's human rights' claim was certified under s.94(2).  Although
    the respondent had a right of appeal against the removal decision  made
    on 23 February 2015 by virtue of s.82(1) read with  s.82(2)(g)  of  the
    NIA Act 2002, the effect of s.94(2) was that the  in-country  right  of
    appeal provision in s.92(4)(a) did not apply.  The right of appeal  was
    only exercisable out-of-country.

 9. For these reasons,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  and  its
    decision must be set aside.  We substitute a  decision  to  the  effect
    that the First-tier Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
