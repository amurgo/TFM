Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms L Kullar, Solicitor, of SH & CO Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant (hereafter the ECO) appeals against the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hussain) allowing  the  respondent's  appeal
    against a decision taken on 26 October 2014 to refuse  entry  clearance
    as the married partner of the sponsor, Mrs Huda Ahamed  Mohammed  Salen
    who is a UK citizen. The respondent and sponsor have a  daughter,  born
    on 22 July 2014, who was conceived during the sponsor's last  visit  to
    Yemen.

Introduction

 3. The respondent is a citizen of Yemen born in 1990. He applied for entry
    clearance on 29 July 2014 but that application was refused on the basis
    that the sponsor had supplied non-genuine documents in support  of  her
    employment  with  Kersten  Management  meaning   that   the   financial
    requirements of Appendix FM were not met and because the TOEIC  English
    language certificate provided by ETS was not obtained with  a  provider
    approved by UKBA. The application was further refused under  Article  8
    of the ECHR.

The Appeal

 4. The respondent appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and attended an oral
    hearing at Birmingham on 15 July 2015.  He  was  represented  by  Mr  O
    Shoker, Solicitor. The First-tier Tribunal found  that  the  respondent
    did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules because  he  did
    not hold a valid English-language test as at the date of decision.  The
    judge found that  the  sponsor  did  work  for  Kersten  Management  as
    claimed. The appeal was allowed under Article 8 on the basis  that  the
    family could not live together in  Yemen  due  to  the  civil  conflict
    there, there was family life between the parties, it was  in  the  best
    interests of the daughter for the respondent to come to the UK and  the
    respondent  had  never  seen  his  daughter.  The  decision   was   not
    proportionate; although the English language test could be retaken  the
    lengthy delays in making a new application  for  entry  clearance  were
    likely to prove significant in light of  the  daughter's  age  and  the
    safety situation in Yemen.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 5. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in  law
    because there were no exceptional circumstances and the outcome was not
    unjustifiably harsh. The respondent could simply take  another  English
    language test and make a fresh application for entry  clearance.  There
    was no adequate explanation why the respondent could not make  a  fresh
    application. Best interests of the child were paramount  but  were  not
    the  only  interests  and  were  subsidiary  to  the  requirements   of
    immigration control.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies on
    18 November 2015 on the basis that it was arguable that the  judge  had
    not given proper consideration as to why the Article  8  claim  outside
    the Rules was worthy of consideration and had identified no exceptional
    or unduly harsh circumstances.

 7. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

 8. Mrs Petterson submitted that the judge used  Article  8  as  a  general
    dispensing power based upon the best  interests  of  the  daughter  and
    living in  Yemen  was  not  part  of  the  decision.  Page  32  of  the
    respondent's bundle showed earnings of just ï¿½4699 for 2013-2014.  There
    was a material error of law and the decision should be reversed.

 9. Ms Kullar submitted that paragraphs 11 and 16 of the decision  set  out
    the facts in relation to the child. Paragraphs  53-55  of  the  Supreme
    Court decision in R (on the application of Bibi) v SSHD [2015] UKSC  68
    were relevant because there are no language test centres in  Yemen  and
    the Foreign Office advice is for all UK citizens to  leave  Yemen.  The
    judge referred to that advice. The respondent would otherwise  have  to
    obtain entry clearance in  Cairo  or  Jordan.  The  daughter  is  a  UK
    citizen.

10. Mrs Petterson submitted in response that Bibi did not strike  down  the
    English language rule. The judge made no findings about  delay  or  any
    problems with making a further application. This application  was  made
    in September 2014 and was refused in October 2014. The ECM review  took
    place in March  2015.  There  is  no  reason  why  a  further  properly
    documented application would take an inordinate time to be decided.

11. Ms Kullar then  further  submitted  that  the  issue  was  whether  the
    requirements of paragraph 39(iv) and 41 of SS Congo [2015] EWCA Civ 387
    were met.

12. I have considered SS Congo. At paragraph 39, the interests of the child
    are a primary consideration  i.e.  an  important  factor  and  not  the
    primary consideration. It is a factor  relevant  to  the  fair  balance
    between the individual and the general community which  goes  some  way
    towards tempering the otherwise wide margin of  appreciation  available
    to the state authorities in deciding what to do. At paragraph  40,  the
    Rules maintain in general terms  a  reasonable  relationship  with  the
    requirements of Article 8 in the ordinary run  of  cases.  However,  it
    remains possible to imagine cases where  the  individual  interests  at
    stake are of a particularly pressing nature so that a  good  claim  for
    leave to enter can be established outside the  Rules.  The  appropriate
    general formulation for this category is that  such  cases  will  arise
    where an applicant  for  leave  to  remain  can  show  that  compelling
    circumstances exist which are not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
    Rules to require the grant of such leave.

13. There is nothing in the First-tier decision that amounts to an analysis
    of potential compelling circumstances. The daughter is safe in  the  UK
    with the sponsor. The respondent is a citizen of Yemen and there are no
    findings of risk to him  or  any  particular  difficulty  or  delay  in
    undertaking a new language test. I find that the failure  to  correctly
    apply the test in SS Congo is a material error of law.

14. There is no consideration of section 117B of the 2002 Act and that is a
    further material error of law under Forman (ss  117A-C  considerations)
    [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC). There is no evidence from the decision that  the
    statutory considerations have been given full effect.

15. I have considered Bibi and accept that paragraph 101 could  potentially
    assist the respondent if it was impossible, in any practical sense,  to
    obtain access to a test centre. However, there is no evidence  of  that
    issue in this appeal.  Further  detailed  findings  of  fact  would  be
    required to justify allowing the appeal on Bibi grounds.

16. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  to  allow  the  respondent's
    appeal under Article 8  involved the making of an error of law and  its
    decision cannot stand.

Decision

17. Ms Kullar invited me to order a rehearing in the First-tier Tribunal if
    I set aside the judge's decision. Bearing in mind paragraph 7.2 of  the
    Senior President's Practice Statements I consider that  an  appropriate
    course of action. There are significant issues of fact which  have  not
    been resolved. I find that the errors of law infect the decision  as  a
    whole and therefore the re-hearing will be de novo with all  issues  to
    be considered again by the First-tier Tribunal.

18. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    order the appeal to be heard again in the  First-Tier  Tribunal  to  be
    determined de novo by a judge other than the previous First-tier judge.
