Shaw, solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad of the Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

 1. The Appellant, Xhevahir Pemaj, is a citizen of Albania born on 28 April
    1982.  On 24 October 1999 as a minor  he  arrived  accompanied  by  his
    adult brother.  They claimed to be Kosovars.  He was granted  leave  to
    enter  or  remain  and  eventually  became   a   naturalised   citizen.
    Subsequently, the Respondent discovered the Appellant is  Albanian  and
    revoked his British citizenship.

 2. He has been in a durable relationship since 2009 with his  partner  Eva
    Lukaj, a British citizen of Kosovan ethnicity born in Mitrovica  on  20
    September 1989. They have a son born in 2010 and a daughter in 2013.

The Secretary of State's Decision

 3. On 21 November 2014 the Respondent served notice in form IS151A  giving
    notice that the Appellant was liable to removal under Section 10 of the
    Immigration & Asylum Act 1999 because he had used deception in  seeking
    leave to remain, stating that:-

         "You are specifically considered a person who has used deception in
         seeking leave to remain because when you originally sought leave to
         remain in the United Kingdom you claimed to be a national of Kosovo
         born in 1985.  In fact you are a national of Albania born in 1982."

    At the same time the Respondent served notice on the Appellant in  form
    IS151B  that  the  Appellant's  claim   for   international   surrogate
    protection and his claim based on  rights  protected  by  the  European
    Convention had been rejected and a decision made  to  remove  him.   It
    should be noted that the Respondent has not supplied  any  Reasons  for
    Refusal Letter separate from form IS151A.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4. On 1 December 2014 the Appellant through his solicitors  lodged  notice
    of appeal under Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 as amended (the 2002 Act).  The grounds are  brief,  formulaic
    and generic and refer to Article 8 of the European Convention.

 5. By a decision promulgated on 3 September 2015 Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal N M K Lawrence dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  by  way  of
    reference to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and  under  "the  New
    Article 8 Rules" and found there was no reason to  consider  the  claim
    under Article 8 of the  European  Convention  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules. The Respondent was not represented at the hearing.

 6. On 21 January 2016 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Parkes refused  the
    Appellant permission to  appeal.   An  application  for  permission  to
    appeal in very similar terms was made to the Upper Tribunal and  on  15
    February 2016 Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer granted  permission  on  the
    basis that it was arguably unfair for the First-tier Tribunal  to  have
    found the Appellant's presence in the United Kingdom was not  conducive
    to the public good when the Respondent had not been present to  advance
    the point and that the other grounds of for appeal  disclosed  arguable
    errors of law.



Error of Law Finding

 7. By a decision promulgated on 22 April 2016 I found that the Judge  made
    no error of law in reaching his conclusion that the Appellant  did  not
    meet the suitability requirements of Appendix  FM  to  the  Immigration
    Rules and that therefore his case did not engage Section EX.1.  I found
    that there was a material error of law in the Judge's treatment of  the
    Appellant's claim under Article 8 of the  European  Convention  outside
    the Rules.  He had not addressed all the factors referred to in Part VA
    of the 2002 Act and had not shown that he had taken  into  account  the
    then current jurisprudence about the circumstances.

 8. The Judge's treatment of the Article 8 claim in paragraph  32  did  not
    rely or refer to the then current jurisprudence about the circumstances
    in which Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules is engaged  which  can
    be found in SSHD v SS (Congo) and Others [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  handed
    down in April 2015 and The Queen (Sunassee) v  Upper  Tribunal  &  SSHD
    [2015 EWHC 1604 (Admin).  I also  refer  to  the  recent  jurisprudence
    particularly in relation to Article 8 outside the  Rules  and  children
    and family claims has been explained in Treebhawon, Abdul (section 55 -
    Article 24(3) Charter) [2016]  UKUT  00106  (IAC)  and  PD  and  Others
    (Article 8-conjoined family appeals) Sri Lanka [2016] UKUT 00108 (IAC).
     Additionally, it was incumbent on the Judge to consider the Article  8
    claim having regard to all members of the family: see paragraph  18  of
    Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11 and Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39 which
    expressly addressed the wider interpretation of  Article  8  so  as  to
    include other family members.  I concluded that the  Judge's  treatment
    of the claim under Article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules  contained
    errors of law and set it aside.

    I went on to  note  that  there  was  no  dispute  as  to  the  factual
    background and directed the hearing be resumed before  me  at  a  later
    date.

 9. Subsequently on 7 July 2016, three days after the  substantive  hearing
    before me, the Court of Appeal handed down judgment in R (MA (Pakistan)
    and Others) v Upper Tribunal (IAC) and Another [2016] EWCA Civ 705.   I
    addressed the construction and application of Section  117B(6)  of  the
    2002 Act.  I enquired of the parties whether they wished  to  make  any
    written submissions on this and Ms. Watterson for  the  Appellant  made
    written submissions.

The Resumed Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. The Appellant and his partner gave oral testimony.  In the event and in
    my view quite properly Ms Ahmad for the Respondent  did  not  challenge
    their credibility.  Additionally, there was oral testimony  as  to  the
    Appellant's good  character  from  three  witnesses  of  whom  two  had
    provided written statements.  This evidence was not  controversial  and
    not challenged.

11. The written and oral testimony shows that the Appellant arrived in  the
    United Kingdom in the company of his older brother Luan.  The  Tribunal
    decisions relating to his  brother's  appeal  are  in  the  Appellant's
    bundle.  These comprise the original First-tier decision  allowing  his
    appeal and the decisions allowing his appeal under  Regulation  15A  of
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 as amended.  The Upper  Tribunal
    decision that the First-tier Tribunal's decision contained  a  material
    error of law and the decision following the  substantive  rehearing  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

12. The Judge at the Upper Tribunal hearing for the Appellant's brother was
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Monson.  By his decision promulgated  on  9
    December 2014 he concluded that the First-tier Tribunal's decision  did
    not contain an error of law and should  stand.   Of  relevance  is  the
    finding that the Appellant's older brother was born on 1 July 1978  and
    entered the United Kingdom  in  1999  claiming  asylum  under  a  false
    identity and claiming falsely to be a Kosovan under the age of 18.   He
    was naturalised as a British citizen  and  married  an  Albanian.   The
    application Appellant's brother's wife's to  join  him  in  the  United
    Kingdom led to the disclosure that the Appellant's brother  was  not  a
    Kosovan as claimed but was an Albanian born  on  1 July  1978.   Their
    first child was born in Albania and while carrying their  second  child
    his wife clandestinely entered the United Kingdom and gave birth.   The
    Respondent in the meantime had revoked the British citizenship  of  the
    Appellant's brother and refused  to  grant  citizenship  to  his  first
    child.  The second child who had been born in the  United  Kingdom  was
    subsequently granted British citizenship.

13. The evidence of the Appellant and his partner  established  that  their
    relationship was akin to marriage and subsisting and that the Appellant
    played a very substantial role in  all  aspects,  including  day-to-day
    care, in the lives of their two children.  The eldest  had  accompanied
    the Appellant's wife to visit the Appellant's parents in Albania on two
    occasions and the younger on one occasion.  The Appellant was  awaiting
    the results of medical checks on his first born's heartbeat but subject
    thereto neither of his children had any medical issues.

14. The Appellant's wife  had  ceased  paid  employment  in  November  2014
    because her work had been too arduous. She had not been able to see the
    children during the working week: see hearing replies 14-21.   She  had
    re-started working outside the home in November 2015.

15. The Appellant's wife explained she had arrived in the United Kingdom at
    the age of 10 with her parents, her brother and two sisters.  They  had
    been recognised as refugees.   At  hearing  reply  52  she  gave  brief
    details of what she had experienced in Kosovo and the hardships she had
    experienced on the journey to the United Kingdom.

16. All her family were now in the United Kingdom. They had been the centre
    of her life since the age of 10: she was born  on  20  September  1989.
    Further, since the age of 16 she had suffered depression  and  been  on
    medication.  She was no longer taking medication because  she  now  had
    the love and support of the Appellant.  Nevertheless because her  whole
    life was based in the United Kingdom she would not be  able  to  go  to
    Albania where she had never lived.   She  had  been  brought  up  in  a
    different tradition and culture.  In Albania she would be  expected  to
    centre her life entirely and exclusively on her home.

17. She considered that the trigger of her depression was because  she  had
    refused to enter into a marriage arranged by her  parents  with  a  man
    whom she described as "quite physical".  The Appellant had brought  her
    to the realisation that not all men were the same:  see  hearing  reply
    49.  It had been a struggle with her parents, particularly because  she
    is Catholic and the Appellant is Muslim.  Once she and her partner  had
    a child, her parents had come to accept the position and she now had  a
    very good relationship with them, although they lived in  North  London
    and she lived with the Appellant in Surrey: see hearing replies 50  and
    51.

18. The two of the  three  character  witnesses  who  had  made  statements
    adopted them.  One confirmed the Appellant's children were his  "number
    one topic of conversation".  The third who had  not  made  a  statement
    said that he knew the Appellant through his nephew and knew him to be a
    family man.  He considered that if the family were split it would  have
    devastating consequences for all members.  The  Appellant  was  helpful
    and considerate and he gave the instance of an occasion when a  car  in
    front of the queue at a set of traffic lights had broken down  and  the
    Appellant insisted on stopping and helping the driver and waiting  with
    her until a recovery vehicle had arrived.

Submissions for the Respondent

19. Ms Ahmad noted that the appeal was focussed on  the  Appellant's  claim
    under Article 8 of the  European  Convention  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.  She referred to paragraphs 31-33 and 51 in SSHD  v  SS  (Congo)
    and Others [2015] EWCA Civ. 387.  At paragraph 32 and 33 the Court  had
    noted that:-

         "... a court or tribunal is required to give the new Rules "greater
         weight than as merely a starting point for the consideration of the
         proportionality of an interference with Article 8 rights.  ...  the
         general position ... is that compelling circumstances would need to
         be identified to support a claim for grant of LTR outside  the  new
         Rules in Appendix FM.  In our view, that is a formulation which  is
         not as strict as a test of exceptionality or a requirement of "very
         compelling reasons" ... "

    The Court  had  re-affirmed  this  position  at  paragraph  51  of  its
    judgment:-

         "...  the  same   general   position   applies,   that   compelling
         circumstances would have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or  LTR
         where the evidence (is the) Rules are not complied with."

    She pointed out the Appellant had used deception to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom and had subsequently maintained that deception.

20. The Tribunal  was  obliged  to  consider  the  best  interests  of  the
    Appellant's children.  The factors identified in Section 117B(6) of the
    2002 Act did not stand alone but had to be considered in the context of
    the other relevant factors identified in Part VA of the 2002 Act.   The
    Upper Tribunal had explained  this  at  paragraphs  36,  39-43  of  its
    decision in PD and Others (Article 8 -  conjoined  family  claims)  Sri
    Lanka [2016] UKUT  00108  (IAC).   Section  117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act
    provided for two tests to  be  made  as  part  of  the  proportionality
    assessment of a claim.  The first was whether the parents  had  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationships with the child and if so,  second
    whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to leave the  United
    Kingdom.  This was described as a mirror image of the test contained in
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) of the Immigration Rules.  The criterion to  be
    applied was that of reasonableness which  involved  a  balance  of  all
    material facts and considerations.   I  note  that  para.13  of  R  (MA
    (Pakistan)) and Others v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ.705 broadly supports this
    last submission of law. The fact that one or both parents may  have  no
    legal right to remain in the United Kingdom was a factor of "undeniable
    weight".

21. Ms Ahmad concluded that both the children  had  visited  Albania  where
    they have paternal grandparents  and  other  paternal  relatives.   The
    appeal should be dismissed on all grounds.

Submissions for the Appellant

22. Ms Watterson accepted that the issues had narrowed since  my  error  of
    law decision promulgated on 22  April  2016.   The  Appellant  had  two
    children who  were  British  by  birth  by  virtue  of  their  mother's
    nationality.  Paragraphs 16-19 of the decision in Treebhawon and Others
    (S.117B(6)) [2015] UKUT 00674 (IAC) had  been  reported  in  which  the
    Upper Tribunal had found at paragraphs 18 and 19 that:-
         "... Section 117B(6) is formulated in unqualified terms:  in  cases
         where its conditions are satisfied, the public  interest  does  not
         require  the  removal  from  the  United  Kingdom  of  the   person
         concerned.  ... there is a freestanding public interest in children
         being reared within a stable family unit.  The effect of part VA of
         the 2002 Act is, ..., that this discrete public interest must yield
         to more potent public interests in certain circumstances."

23. The Tribunal had heard evidence about the  close  relationship  of  the
    Appellant with his children and how he played a very important role  in
    their lives.  It should be noted that  the  children  involved  in  the
    appeals of Treebhawon and PD and Others were not British citizens.  The
    Tribunal in Sanade and Others (British children -  Zambrano  -  Dereci)
    [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC) had said at paragraphs 89-95:-

         "89. In the present cases the mothers of all of the British citizen
             children are citizens themselves  and  cannot  be  removed  as
             family members of a person facing deportation or in their  own
             right. Although the removal of the father would  have  adverse
             economic impact on all the families, as well as the  interests
             of each child living in a household with its father, it cannot
             be said that either the children  or  their  mothers  will  be
             required to leave with him. There is an analogy with the  case
             of Mr Dereci who was found not to have  a  Zambrano  right  of
             residence. Economic reasons for maintaining family  unity  are
             not sufficient.


         90.  We recognise that the appellants  have  submitted  by  way  of
             reply that according to  the  Advocate  General's  opinion  an
             impairment of the exercise of the Treaty  right  of  residence
             may suffice to engage the Zambrano principle. This was not how
             the Court answered the question, however, and in our judgment,
             if on the facts removal of the appellant will not require  the
             children or spouse to follow because they have no capacity for
             exercising their  Treaty  rights  independent  of  the  person
             facing removal, what is being impaired is  not  the  right  to
             reside in the EU but the right to enjoy family life whilst  so
             residing.


         91.  Each of the children are not accordingly  dependent  on  their
             fathers for the exercise of their Union  rights  of  residence
             and removal of the  fathers  will  not  deprive  them  of  the
             effective exercise of that right of residence  in  the  United
             Kingdom or elsewhere in the Union.


         92.  Cases where the remaining parent not facing removal is  either
             a British citizen or a third country national will be governed
             by Article 8.  It is in that context that the  nationality  of
             the remaining  parent  as  well  as  that  of  the  child  has
             relevance.


         93.  Finally, we note that a further question on which we asked for
             the respondent's assistance was in these terms:


                  "Does the respondent agree that in a  case  where  a  non-
                  national parent is  being  removed  and  claims  it  is  a
                  violation of that person's human rights  to  be  separated
                  from a child with whom he presently enjoys family life  as
                  an engaged  parent,  that  a  consequence  of  the  CJEU's
                  judgment is that it is  not  open  to  the  respondent  to
                  submit that an interference can be avoided because  it  is
                  reasonable to expect the child (and presumably  any  other
                  parent/carer who is  not  facing  deportation/removal)  to
                  join the appellant in the country of origin?  If  not  why
                  not?"


         94.  To this Mr Devereux replied on 24 November 2011:


                  "We do accept, however, that  in  a  case  where  a  third
                  country national is unable to claim a right to  reside  on
                  the basis set out above it will not logically be possible,
                  when assessing  the  compatibility  of  their  removal  or
                  deportation with the ECHR to argue that  any  interference
                  with Article 8 rights could be avoided by the family  unit
                  moving to a country which is outside of the EU".


         95.  We shall take this helpful submission  into  account  when  we
             consider the application of  Article  8  to  each  appellant's
             case. We agree with it.  This means that where  the  child  or
             indeed the remaining spouse is a British citizen and therefore
             a citizen of the European Union, it is not possible to require
             them to relocate outside of the European Union  or  to  submit
             that it would be reasonable for them to do so. The case serves
             to emphasise the importance of nationality already  identified
             in the decision of the Supreme  Court  in  ZH  (Tanzania).  If
             interference with the family life is to be justified,  it  can
             only be on the basis that the conduct  of  the  person  to  be
             removed gives rise to considerations  of  such  weight  as  to
             justify separation."


24. Ms Watterson referred me to the  Respondent's  Immigration  Directorate
    Instruction on family migration  to  support  this  and  in  particular
    paragraph 11.2.3 which stated:-

         'Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker  must  not
         take a decision in relation to the parent or  primary  carer  of  a
         British citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to
         force that British child to leave the EU, regardless of the age  of
         that child.  This reflects the European Court of  Justice  Judgment
         in Zambrano.'

    I noted that there was no reference in the documentation submitted  for
    the Respondent that the Respondent had referred the  prospective  break
    up of the Appellant's family to the Children's champion.

25. She continued that as Ms Ahmad had mentioned, paragraph 39  of  PD  and
    Others required the test to be applied  to  be  one  of  reasonableness
    balancing all material facts and considerations.   Such  considerations
    together with the fact that the relevant Immigration Rules did not take
    account of the Appellant's British citizen child or  the  circumstances
    of his children were such that the test of exceptionality to result  in
    a proper application of Article 8 was appropriate: see paragraph 29  of
    SS (Congo).  Additional factors included that the  Appellant's  partner
    and the mother of his children was not an Albanian national.  She was a
    child refugee.  There was the issue of the difficulties which the  fact
    of the Appellant's mixed faith relationship would  create  in  Albania.
    The Appellant's partner in her evidence had demonstrated her commitment
    to an integration with the values of the European Union.  The Appellant
    himself had been living in the United Kingdom almost  seventeen  years,
    having arrived on 24 October 1979: this was also almost half his life.
    The life chances of the  children  in  Albania  would  be  considerably
    reduced and it would be unreasonable to expect them to relocate  there.



26. Ms Watterson referred to the  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  of  the
    European Union and in particular Article 24(3) which provided  for  the
    qualified right of every  child  to  maintain  on  a  regular  basis  a
    personal relationship and direct contact with both his or her  parents,
    unless this is contrary to his or  her  interests.   The  Tribunal  had
    heard evidence of the close relationship  of  the  Appellant  with  his
    children and his role in their day-to-day care.

27. She continued  that  there  was  no  history  of  any  adverse  conduct
    subsequent to the Appellant's unlawful entry: he was of good character.
     It would be disproportionate to split his family and the appeal should
    be allowed.

Findings and Consideration

28. There was no challenge to  the  credibility  of  the  evidence  of  the
    Appellant and his  partner.   I  find  that  there  was  no  reason  to
    challenge it.

29. The Appellant cannot  succeed  on  the  Immigration  Rules,  not  least
    because  he  has  already  been  found  not  to  meet  the  suitability
    requirements of Appendix FM on account of the deception  which  he  and
    his brother practised on arrival and which subsequently  he  has  until
    comparatively recently maintained.  He does  not  satisfy  the  minimum
    periods of residence in the United Kingdom  referred  to  in  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules, albeit he has now  spent  nearly  half
    his life in the United Kingdom.

30. I turn to whether Article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules  should  be
    considered.  I have had regard to the jurisprudence in paragraph 56  of
    SSHD v SS (Congo) and others [2015] EWCA Civ.387 and  paragraph  43  in
    the judgment of The Queen (Sunassee) v Upper Tribunal  (IAC)  and  SSHD
    [2015] EWHC 1604 (Admin).

31. The Immigration Rules by reason of their very nature are  a  check-list
    but an assessment of a claim under Article 8  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules requires  a  holistic  approach.   In  addition  to  the  matters
    mentioned in considering the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  there
    are also the additional factors of the Appellant's two British national
    children, his partner's history as a child  refugee  from  Kosovo,  the
    presence in the United Kingdom of all her extended family, that she has
    claimed there  will  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  establishing
    herself and her children Albania: she is not Albanian, they have  never
    lived in Albania and she does not accept what she  perceives  would  be
    the cultural straitjacket which would likely be imposed on her  if  she
    were to attempt to relocate to Albania. I find these are  circumstances
    making it appropriate to consider the claims on grounds of Article 8 of
    the European Convention outside the Immigration Rules.

32. I turn to the factors to be taken into  account  mentioned  in  section
    117B of  the  2002  Act,  noting  that  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration controls is in the public interest. The Appellant  and  his
    wife evidently speak fluent English and their evidence shows they  have
    been able to maintain themselves and their family and  are  financially
    independent. The Appellant's private and family  life  was  established
    and continued at a time when  he  had  documentation  to  show  he  was
    lawfully present until probably late 2014 when the  Respondent  revoked
    his British citizenship. There was  no  argument  before  the  Tribunal
    whether in these circumstances the Appellant's private and family  life
    had been established when he was lawfully in the United Kingdom or what
    his immigration status was. For most of  the  time  he  was  a  British
    citizen by naturalisation. It would appear that that was a status which
    was voidable rather than null and void from the start.

33. Most importantly, there remains section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act. Absent
    any material factors, it is not in the  public  interest  to  remove  a
    person who has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship  with  a
    qualifying child where it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child
    to leave United Kingdom. The Respondent did not challenge that each  of
    the Appellant's children is a qualifying child.

34. At paragraph 23 of The Queen (MA (Pakistan) and Others the Court said:

         "it is now firmly established jurisprudence,  at  least  since  the
         seminal decision of the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania).... that the
         best interests of the child is a primary consideration which has to
         be taken into account in all cases where the child's interests  are
         affected."

35. At paragraph 52 of  its  judgment  the  Court  referred  to  the  seven
    principles which  need  to  be  borne  in  mind  when  considering  the
    interests of the child in context of an Article 8 evaluation in Zoumbas
    v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74. The seventh principle is that child must not  be
    blamed for matters for which he or she is not responsible, such as  the
    conduct  of  a  parent.  I  am  satisfied  that  even  on  the  limited
    information about the Appellant's children available to the Tribunal at
    the hearing, it is in their best interests to remain in the joint  care
    of the Appellant and their mother in the setting  in  which  they  have
    lived their entire lives to date. I do take account  of  the  fact  the
    eldest is not yet aged seven. I also bear in mind that Albania  is  not
    within the European Union.

36. Adopting the approach to such appeals summarised in R (Razgar)  v  SSHD
    [2004] UKHL 27, I find that each of the Appellant and his  partner  has
    established a private and family life in the United  Kingdom  and  that
    the removal of each of them, albeit as  a  family  unit,  would  be  an
    interference of such gravity as to engage the operation of  Article  8.
    There was no suggestion that any interference would be  otherwise  than
    in accordance with the law and for the legitimate  public  end  of  the
    economic well-being of the country which includes the need to  maintain
    proper immigration control.  The assessment of the  proportionality  of
    removal  must  nevertheless  depend  upon   any   particular   set   of
    circumstances.

37. I have already referred the decision in Sanade and paragraph 11.2.3  of
    the IDI. With these in mind and taking into account  the  circumstances
    of the Appellant and his family, I find the only adverse factor of  any
    materiality weighing against the proportionality of his removal is  the
    deceit which he practised, initially under the tutelage  of  his  older
    brother, on entry as a minor. I take account of the Appellant's failure
    to take any steps to rectify that deceit which failure is deserving  of
    criticism and condemnation. Nevertheless, the failure to take steps  to
    draw the deceit to the attention of the United Kingdom  authorities  is
    understandable. The Appellant initially was a minor and thereafter  was
    endeavouring to establish himself and human nature is  such  that  many
    people would have difficulty in maintaining a continuing  awareness  of
    such culpable behaviour and with the passage of  time  the  many  would
    cease to think of it and become oblivious of it.

38. Taking account of my findings in relation to the factors identified  by
    section 117B of the  2002  Act  and  the  other  circumstances  of  the
    Appellant and his family together with the jurisprudence  developed  ZH
    (Tanzania) and subsequently as summarised in  Sanade,  I  come  to  the
    conclusion that after giving all due  weight  to  the  public  interest
    consideration  of  the  economic  well-being  of  the  State  and   the
    maintenance of proper immigration control, it will be  disproportionate
    to those legitimate objectives to  remove  the  Appellant.  The  appeal
    therefore succeeds under Article 8 of the European  Convention  outside
    the Immigration Rules.



Anonymity

39. There was no request for  an  anonymity  order  and  having  heard  the
    substantive appeal, I find that there is no such order is warranted.



NOTICE OF DECISION

    The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds (Article 8).
    No anonymity order is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT: FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no fee  award.
The Appellant became a victim of his own  original  deceit  and  failure  to
regularise his immigration status. The Respondent acted  promptly  upon  re-
discovering the Appellant's lack of status and the reasons for the  decision
under appeal were justified on the basis of the information  then  available
to the Respondent.
