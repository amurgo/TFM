                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Khan, Counsel, instructed by Fountain Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Whilst the respondent is the appellant in these proceedings before me,
    I hereafter refer to the parties using terminology used in the First-
    tier Tribunal.  The appellant in the First-tier Tribunal will hereafter
    be referred to as "the appellant" in these proceedings, and the
    respondent will be referred to as "the respondent".


 2. The appellant, a Pakistani national, entered the United Kingdom as a
    student on 26 October 2010. His leave was initially extended until 12
    October 2013, but that leave was curtailed before his leave was
    extended on 1 September 2013 enabling him to remain his as a Tier 4
    (General) student until 9 April 2016.


 3. On 26 April 2014 the appellant was served with form IS151A because he
    was found to have used deception to obtain leave by using a proxy taker
    to obtain his TOEIC certificate. On 27 April 2017 he made an
    application for leave to remain which was refused by the respondent on
    14 May 2018.

 4. The appellant appealed the decision under section 82(1) of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and his appeal came before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Andrew (hereinafter referred to as the
    "FTT Judge") on 19 November 2018 who in a decision promulgated on
    21November 2018 allowed the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.



 5. The respondent appealed this decision on 27 November 2018 arguing the
    FTT Judge had erred in dealing with the appellant's immigration history
    and this impacted on her assessment under article 8 ECHR.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted to the appellant by Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Pedro on 27 December 2018 who in granting permission
    found it was arguable the FTT Judge had erred by failing to give
    sufficient weight to the public interest and failed to apply the "real
    world test" in KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53.

 7. A Rule 24 reply, dated 29 January 2019, argued that the FTT Judge had
    considered S117B(6) of the 2002 Act correctly and had properly balanced
    the best interests of the child against the adverse findings made
    against the appellant. The Court made clear that the "reasonableness"
    test in both section 117B(6) and paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) involved a
    child-centred approach set in a 'real world' context.

 8. In JG (s.117B(6); "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey [2019] UKUT 00072
    the Tribunal stated Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act required a court or
    Tribunal to hypothesise that the child in question would leave the
    United Kingdom, even if this is not likely to be the case, and ask
    whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to do so.

 9. No anonymity direction is made.

    SUBMISSIONS


10. Ms Aboni adopted the grounds of appeal and invited the Tribunal to find
    an error in law. In dealing with Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act the
    FTT Judge failed to weigh up the best interests of the children against
    the appellant's immigration history and in doing so had erred. The fact
    the appellant had used deception in applying for further leave and had
    then absconded when the deception was detected were factors the FTT
    Judge should have given greater weight to. The appellant had no basis
    of stay, had formed a relationship with partner and chosen to have a
    family life despite knowing his immigration status. The child was not
    required to leave the United Kingdom as they could stay with mother or
    they could choose to accompany him and their mother to Pakistan. She
    placed reliance on pages 68-69 of the Family Migration Appendix FM 1.0b
    April 2019 policy document.

11. Mr Khan relied on the Rule 24 reply and invited the  Tribunal  to  find
    the respondent's grounds of appeal were a mere  disagreement  with  the
    FTT Judge's decision. The Supreme Court in KO considered  the  February
    2018 IDI (current one is April 2019) and made it clear the child's best
    interests must not be affected by the public interest. At para [17] the
    Court made clear section 117B(6) was a free standing test and the "real
    world test", set out in para 18 and 19, was the test to be applied.  If
    one parent has no right to remain, but the other parent does,  that  is
    the background against which the assessment had  to  be  conducted.  If
    neither parent had the right to remain, then  that  is  the  background
    against which the assessment is conducted. Thus the  ultimate  question
    was, "is it reasonable to expect the child to follow the parent with no
    right to remain to the country of origin?"

12. In this case the children's mother had the  right  to  remain  and  the
    question was whether it was reasonable to expect the child to leave the
    UK?

13. The appellant was not guaranteed to succeed  with  an  entry  clearance
    application because he had practised  deception  and  if  he  were  not
    allowed back into the country there would be a break in family life.

14. The child's mother was unable to return to Pakistan  because  a  forced
    marriage protection order (pages 45-47) had been obtained  because  the
    police feared she would be forced to marry a cousin  in  Pakistan,  and
    she feared her family would find her were she to return.

15. If conduct came into the assessment (old style article 8  appeal)  then
    the FTT Judge had to consider whether reasonable for children to  leave
    the UK and did the public interest require the children to leave the UK
    and go to Pakistan. The FTT  Judge  took  into  account  the  following
    factors and concluded that removal was not proportionate. Those factors
    were:

      a) Children were 3ï¿½ and 10 months.

      b) At par 37 the Judge recognised the  children  are  very  young  and
         return was not contemplated.

      c) Children's best interests  for  the  appellant  to  be  allowed  to
         remain.

      d) At para 38 the Judge allowed the appeal with some reluctance

      e) Judge reached conclusion that was open  to  them.  Public  interest
         tilts in their favour.

16. The decision was open to  the  FTT  Judge  and  the  appeal  should  be
    dismissed.

17. Ms Aboni responded that although the FTT Judge  found  the  appellant's
    wife would not wish to return, there had also been a finding she  would
    not be at risk having visited Pakistan on a number of occasions and any
    entry clearance application cannot be pre-judged by the  FTT  Judge  as
    respondent makes this decision. She asked that I set aside the decision
    and remake it

    FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

18. This was an application for leave  to  remain  by  an  appellant  whose
    application to remain had been refused after it was discovered  he  had
    used deception to extend his stay by the use of a proxy taker. The  FTT
    Judge allowed the appellant's appeal and the respondent has  challenged
    that decision.

19. In KO Lord Carnwath left  open  the  question  of  "reasonableness"  by
    holding that the best interests assessment must be  conducted  in  "the
    real world in which the children  find  themselves."  In  doing  so  he
    endorsed the approach in EV (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ 874  and  SA
    (Bangladesh) 2017 SLT 1245 that the child's right to remain does  not
    automatically guarantee that the  parents  will  be  granted  leave  to
    remain as well.

20. In JG, Mr Justice Lane stated:

         "39. We do not consider our construction of section 117B(6) can  be
         affected by the respondent's submission that, in cases where  -  on
         his interpretation - the subsection does not  have  purchase  (i.e.
         because the child would not in practice leave the United  Kingdom),
         there would nevertheless need to be  a  full-blown  proportionality
         assessment, compatibly with the other provisions of Part 5A of  the
         2002  Act,  with  the  result   that   a   person   with   parental
         responsibility  who  could  not   invoke   section   117B(6)   may,
         nevertheless, succeed in a human rights appeal.

         40. Such an assessment would, however, have to take account of  the
         immigration history of the person  subject  to  removal;  so  there
         could well be a very real difference between the  outcome  of  that
         exercise, and one conducted under section 117B(6).  But,  the  real
         point is that this submission does not begin to  affect  the  plain
         meaning of subsection (6). If, as we  have  found,  Parliament  has
         decreed a particular outcome by enacting section 117B(6), then that
         is the end of the matter.

         96. We therefore conclude that, on the facts of this case, it would
         not be reasonable to expect the appellant's children to  leave  the
         United Kingdom, in the  event  of  her  removal.   This  means  the
         appellant's appeal succeeds.  It does  so  because  Parliament  has
         stated, in terms, that the public interest  does  not  require  her
         removal, in these circumstances.  It does so despite the fact that,
         absent  section  117B(6),  the   appellant's   removal   would   be
         proportionate in terms of Article 8 of the ECHR."

21. The Court of Appeal in AB (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ 661  upheld  this
    core reasoning and Singh LJ stated,

         "I respectfully agree. It is clear, in my view, that  the  question
         which the statute requires to be addressed is a single question: is
         it reasonable to expect the child to leave  the  UK?  It  does  not
         consist of two questions, as suggested by the Secretary  of  State.
         If the answer to the single question  is  obvious,  because  it  is
         common ground that the child will not be expected to leave the  UK,
         that does not mean that the question does not have to be asked;  it
         merely means that the answer to the question is: No."

22. It is against this background that I  have  considered  the  respective
    submissions. Effectively, Ms  Aboni  argued  the  FTT  Judge  erred  by
    placing insufficient weight on  the  appellant's  immigration  history.
    That approach has been found by both the Upper Tribunal and  the  Court
    of Appeal to be wrong. The appellant's immigration history  would  come
    into play if it was not unreasonable for the child to leave and a  full
    blown assessment under article 8 ECHr was being carried out.

23. At paragraph [37] the FTT Judge considered section 117B(6) and the  FTT
    Judge gave reasons why it was unreasonable to expect  the  children  to
    leave on the basis the children and their mother were British  citizens
    and the mother could not consider a return to Pakistan.

24. Both the grounds of appeal and the grant of permission failed to engage
    with what the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal subsequently  said
    about section 117B(6) post KO and the approach to be taken  and  whilst
    it may seem unpalatable that a person  who  has  acted  dishonestly  be
    allowed to remain, that was a finding the FTT Judge could  come  to  in
    light  of  how  the  courts  have  since  interpreted  KO  and  in  the
    circumstances there is no error in law.
