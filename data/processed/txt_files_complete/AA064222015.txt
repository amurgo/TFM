                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly.  This order  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.   Any
failure to comply with this order could  give  rise  to  contempt  of  court
proceedings.


 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal at Newport, dismissing his appeal against  the  Secretary
    of State's decision to refuse him international  protection  under  the
    Refugee Convention or humanitarian protection grounds or to grant leave
    to remain on human rights grounds.  The decision under challenge  is  a
    fresh claim application under paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules HC
    395 (as amended).

 2. By a decision dated 5 August 2016, I set aside the First-tier  Tribunal
    decision for the reasons therein set out.  In particular, at [14]-[16],
    I set out the medical evidence of Dr Arnold as to past ill-treatment of
    the appellant, which was prepared to the Istanbul Protocol standard.  I
    stated in my decision that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law  at
    [86] in relation to whether Dr Arnold had ruled out alternative  causes
    for the appellant's injuries, as the Istanbul Protocol requires him  to
    do.

 3. It is now accepted in the light of the evidence before me by Mr  Walker
    for the Home Office, first, that there has been previous  ill-treatment
    amounting to torture and that paragraph 339K of the Rules is  in  play,
    and secondly that, as set out in the appellant's skeleton argument  and
    in various places at section 1 of the appellant's bundle, most recently
    the U.S. Department of State Report on Cameroon for 2014,  that  prison
    conditions in Cameroon are such as to amount to a breach of  Article  3
    ECHR.  Neither of those matters is now in dispute. It is also  accepted
    by the respondent that the appellant's birth certificate is  a  genuine
    document.

 4. The disputed documents remain the and the, a summons (convocation)  and
    an arrest document (mandat d'arrï¿½t)  from  the  Republic  of  Cameroon.
    There is a history in relation to these documents, because at  [24]  in
    the First-tier Tribunal decision of 11 November 2009, which  should  be
    the Devaseelan starting point for my decision, the Judge said this:

         "24. ... Whereas the appellant has now produced what purport to  be
         original documents confirming his conviction and  the  issue  of  a
         warrant for his arrest, I do not believe the story that he has told
         and I therefore do not believe  these  are  genuine  documents.   I
         follow the guidance given in Tanveer  Ahmed  (Documents  unreliable
         and forged) Pakistan* [2002] UKIAT 00439."

    That is a plain Tanveer Ahmed error because the judge  is  required  to
    determine whether or not the documents are reliable and then take  that
    into account in concluding whether the appellant is a credible witness,
    not the other way around.  I do not regard  myself  as  bound  by  that
    finding on Devaseelan principles.

 5. When taking instructions this morning, Mr Walker was instructed to make
    an application to adjourn the hearing,  to  enable  the  respondent  to
    carry out document verification on the court documents  from  Cameroon.
    I refused that application for an adjournment because these proceedings
    date back to 2009 and were adjourned  in  August  2016,  following  the
    error of law decision, to give the opportunity for fresh documents  and
    so forth to produced and agreed if  possible.   I  cannot  see  a  good
    reason under paragraph 15(2A) why the  respondent  should  be  given  a
    further opportunity to verify documents which it has been open  to  her
    to verify at any time  since  they  were  disclosed  in  2009,  and  in
    particular, since the error of law decision in August 2016.

 6. In a further refusal letter on 27 March 2015, the respondent considered
    the disputed documents, in the following terms:

         "98. As noted above, the IJ at your appeal  determination  did  not
             believe the story  you  had  told  and  did  not  believe  the
             documents you provided at the hearing to  be  genuine  as  you
             claimed.

         99.  Given the above information,  combined  with  the  Immigration
             Judge's findings that your account was not credible  and  also
             applying the guidelines of Tanveer Ahmed I am not satisfied to
             the required standards that the documents can be relied  upon.
             Subsequently no weight is given to the documents.

         100. Consideration has been given to the business licence; receipts
             of payment and  a  declaration  to  register  of  commerce  of
             Cenfocam which you claim prove that you were the  director  of
             Cenfocam.  Consideration has not  been  given  to  the  arrest
             warrant, summons and document entitled 'Convocation' as  these
             documents were considered previously at your  appeal  hearing.
             Consideration has been given to  the  case  of  Tanveer  Ahmed
             [2002] UKIAT 00439.

         101. The Tribunal  ruled  that  the  burden  of  proof  is  on  the
             applicant to show that documentary evidence submitted  can  be
             relied upon.   However,  it  is  for  the  decision  maker  to
             consider whether a document is one on  which  reliance  should
             properly be placed after looking at all of the evidence in the
             round.  Where it is not possible to determine the authenticity
             of a document, decision makers should take  into  account  the
             general credibility of the claim and any  information  in  the
             relevant country of  information  report  about  standards  of
             documentation in that country in determining what  weight  and
             credence to attach to it."

 7. There is no evidence in the material before me that the respondent ever
    complied with the clear statement of the duty upon her at [101];  given
    the instructions given to Mr  Walker  this  morning  I  find  that  the
    respondent has had 8 years in which it would have been possible for her
    to have sought to verify the authenticity of  these  Cameroonian  court
    documents.

 8. I consider for myself whether they are reliable, on the  basis  of  the
    evidence before me.  I have before me a report from Dr Charlotte Walker-
    Said, with a covering letter dated 25 November 2016, which is the  only
    external evidence of the reliability of  the  disputed  documents.   Dr
    Charlotte Walker-Said is an assistant professor at  the  Department  of
    Africana Studies at the John Jay  College  of  Criminal  Justice,  City
    University of New York and she sets out in her  report  her  specialist
    knowledge of Cameroon.  She has not met the appellant.

 9. Dr Walker-Said was asked to examine the  documents  relied  upon.   She
    examined the birth certificate, and, like the respondent, she found  it
    likely to be authentic and  official.  She  then  examined  the  police
    summons (the convocation), and after  considering  it  in  detail,  she
    found that document to be probably genuine although it was missing some
    numbers, and bore no summons code or  file  number.   Dr  Walker-Said's
    opinion on the convocation was that:

          "This document fulfils many of the requirements  for  authenticity
         in Cameroon.  However, some  appropriate  references  are  missing,
         namely an  official  summons  number  and  judicial  code  for  the
         summons, which is issued by a police force, but is then also copied
         by the  National  Security  Forces,  which  typically  requires  an
         official summons file number.  The fact that there  is  no  summons
         code or file number means that this  particular  Protocol  was  not
         followed.  This is not necessarily an indication of a false  or  an
         inauthentic document.  It might only indicate that in this case the
         issuing police officer did not create a  file  number  or  judicial
         code for this document.  This could reflect the hurried  and  often
         ad hoc nature of policing in Cameroon, rather than necessarily  the
         inauthenticity of  the  document.   Nevertheless,  that  aspect  is
         missing."

10. Dr Walker-Said considered the arrest warrant, and was satisfied that it
    was genuine.  She then considered a transcript of the verdict from  the
    High Court of Wouri of 21 December 2007, Jugement No. 950/CRIM, Extrait
    des Minutes du Greffe du Tribunal de  Grande  Instance  du  Wouri.  Her
    opinion was that the transcript reflected an authentic court ruling and
    further supported her conclusion that the arrest warrant  was  genuine.
    Dr  Walker-Said  also  verified  as  genuine  the  appellant's  company
    registration document, commercial registration document,  his  business
    licence and tax authorisation.

11. That is the only evidence I have  to  assist  me  assessing  the  court
    documents.  Where the respondent has sought to  verify  documents,  the
    evidence of Dr Walker-Said corroborates  the  respondent's  assessment.
    On the basis of this evidence, I accept that the  court  documents  and
    convocation are genuine and that there is an  arrest  warrant  for  the
    appellant in Cameroon.

12. In those circumstances, paragraph 339K sets  out  the  approach  to  be
    followed:

         "339K.   The fact  that  a  person  has  already  been  subject  to
         persecution  or  serious  harm,  or  to  direct  threats  of   such
         persecution or such harm, will be regarded as a serious  indication
         of the person's well-founded fear of persecution or  real  risk  of
         suffering serious harm, unless there are good reasons  to  consider
         that such persecution or serious harm will not be repeated."

13. Nothing in the respondent's refusal letter or in the evidence before me
    indicates, or even addresses,  the  question  whether  there  are  good
    reasons for considering that the serious harm will not be  repeated.  I
    must therefore consider that for myself.  The documents  indicate  that
    there is a summons and an arrest warrant for him in  Cameroon.   He  is
    likely to be detained on return, and the evidence, which the respondent
    has not disputed, is that prison conditions in Cameroon are such as  to
    breach Article 3 ECHR.

14. If the court documents are genuine, as I have found that they are,  and
    the appellant has suffered serious ill-treatment in  detention  in  the
    past, as the evidence indicates that  he  has,  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence before me, the respondent has not shown that  there  are  good
    reasons to consider that he will not be detained again  on  return,  or
    that the ill-treatment at  the  level  or  serious  harm  will  not  be
    repeated.

15. Accordingly, I substitute a decision allowing the appeal on asylum  and
    human rights grounds, and  dismissing  it  on  humanitarian  protection
    grounds, because there cannot be  a  humanitarian  protection  decision
    where refugee protection has been given.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the First-tier Tribunal decision.  I  re-make  the  decision  in
the appeal by allowing it.
