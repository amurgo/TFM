For the Appellant:     Mr S Bellara, Direct Access Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, a national of India, appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    against a decision made by the Secretary of State on 16th November 2018
    refusing his application for leave to remain in the UK on the basis  of
    his private life.  First-tier Tribunal Judge L K  Gibbs  dismissed  the
    appeal in a decision promulgated on 18th February 2019.  The  Appellant
    now appeals against that decision with permission granted by Judge P  J
    M Hollingworth on 3rd May 2019.

 2. The background to this appeal is that on 30th August 2009 the Appellant
    entered the UK with leave to enter  as  a  working  holidaymaker  valid
    until 25th August 2011 and thereafter overstayed in  the  UK.   On  9th
    January 2018 he made an application for leave to remain on the basis of
    his private life saying that he is caring for  his  maternal  aunt  and
    uncle who need him to remain in the UK.  He lodged  an  appeal  against
    the decision to refuse his application.

 3. The appeal was initially listed to be heard on  10th  January  2019  in
    Newport.  His representatives wrote  to  request  that  the  appeal  be
    transferred to Hatton Cross.  That request was refused on 21st December
    2018 and after that the Appellant's legal representatives wrote to  the
    Tribunal asking for the appeal to be dealt  with  on  the  papers.  The
    Appellant submitted a witness statement and a copy of his  passport  on
    9th January 2019.  The appeal was adjourned and listed to be  heard  in
    Hatton Cross on 28th January 2019.  The Appellant was notified of  that
    hearing.  The Appellant did not attend the hearing at Hatton Cross  and
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge was satisfied that the Appellant had been
    notified of the day, time and place of the hearing and  proceeded  with
    the hearing in the Appellant's absence.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  found  that  the  Appellant  failed  to
    provide any evidence that he would face very significant  obstacles  to
    integration in India and that he had not demonstrated that he  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.   The  judge
    found that the Appellant failed to provide  any  evidence  that  he  is
    caring for his aunt  and  uncle.   The  judge  took  into  account  the
    evidence before him of the Appellant's application for entry  clearance
    as a working holidaymaker and the successful appeal against that as set
    out in the decision from Immigration Judge Moore  on  23rd  July  2009.
    Based on the evidence  before  him  Judge  Gibbs  considered  that  the
    Appellant had not demonstrated  that  he  had  established  private  or
    family life in the  UK  or  that  the  decision  to  remove  him  would
    interfere with any private or family life so as to  engage  Article  8.
    The judge also took  into  account  Section  117  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and  found  that  there  was  a  strong
    public interest in removing the Appellant.

The grounds of appeal

 5. The Appellant appealed against that decision on the grounds that he had
    requested that the appeal be considered only on the papers, whereas  in
    fact it was considered at an oral hearing.  He further  contended  that
    the Home Office made an error in his refusal letter in that it had said
    that he had entered the UK illegally, whereas in fact according to  his
    passport and witness statement he entered legally with a visa.  He also
    contended that all of his relatives are in  the  UK  and  none  are  in
    India.  In the witness statement submitted  on  9th  January  2019  the
    Appellant also said that he  was  denied  a  fair  trial  as  he  never
    received a Home Office bundle.

 6. At the hearing before me Mr Bellara submitted that the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal should be set aside  on  the  basis  of  procedural
    unfairness.  He submitted that there was confusion in relation  to  the
    venue.  He submitted that the Appellant had requested a  paper  hearing
    but in fact the matter was listed for an oral  hearing.   He  contended
    that the Appellant  had  not  received  the  Respondent's  bundle.   He
    submitted that the Appellant had shown him a letter which  he  said  he
    had sent to Hatton Cross saying that he had  been  confused  about  the
    oral hearing notification.  He accepted that there was no date for this
    letter and he had not seen evidence that had been posted  or  that  had
    been sent.  He contended that all of the aspects of this  matter  taken
    together show that there was a procedural irregularity.

Error of Law

 7. In my view there  is  no  procedural  irregularity  in  this  case  and
    therefore no error of law.

 8. The Appellant lodged an appeal against the decision of the Secretary of
    State indicating that he wanted to proceed by way of oral hearing.  His
    solicitor requested that the hearing be transferred to Hatton Cross  or
    Taylor House.  That request was refused and on 24th December 2018.  The
    Appellant's solicitors then wrote to the Tribunal requesting  that  the
    appeal be considered only on the papers and requesting a refund of  the
    extra fee of ï¿½60.  The matter was listed for hearing  on  10th  January
    but was adjourned as the Appellant did not attend.

 9. A number of directions were issued and the case was subsequently listed
    for hearing on 28th January 2019 at Hatton Cross.  The  Appellant  does
    not dispute that he received notice  of  that  hearing.   Although  the
    matter was listed for hearing, as the Appellant  did  not  appear,  the
    judge went on to determine the appeal on the papers.  I do not see  any
    prejudice to the Appellant in this approach.  The judge considered  the
    appeal on the papers but the Appellant had the opportunity to attend an
    oral hearing in the venue he had requested  but  failed  to  take  that
    opportunity.  Although the Appellant was not represented at  that  time
    he had previously been represented and the decision to proceed  on  the
    papers had been taken with the benefit of  legal  representation.   The
    Appellant was aware of the oral hearing date and  could  have  attended
    had he wished to.  He did not attend and the judge went on to determine
    the appeal on the papers as in accordance with the Appellant's request.

10. It appears that the Appellant may not have  received  the  Respondent's
    bundle.  However, the Respondent's bundle in this case  comprises  only
    the application form, the covering  letter  from  the  solicitors,  the
    Notice of Appeal and the decision.  These are all  documents  submitted
    by the Appellant.

11. It appears that at the hearing the judge was given  documents  relating
    to the previous appeal against the decision to refuse  entry  clearance
    as  a  working  holidaymaker.   Again  these  are  documents  that  the
    Appellant had access to.  Accordingly there was  no  prejudice  to  the
    Appellant in terms of any of the documents considered by the  judge  at
    the appeal.  The judge clearly had the  Appellant's  witness  statement
    and copy of his passport [4].

12. In conclusion, it is my view that there was no procedural irregularity.
     There  was  no  prejudice  to  the  Appellant  in  the  way  that  the
    proceedings were conducted.  The judge considered all of the  available
    evidence and reached a conclusion open to her  on  the  basis  of  that
    evidence that the Appellant had not demonstrated that his removal would
    breach Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

13.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does  not  contain  a  material
error of law.

14.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal will stand.

15.  No anonymity direction is made.
