For the Appellant:     Mr A Burrett, Counsel; Ozoran Turkan Solicitors
For the Claimant: Ms S Sreeraman, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Aujla dismissing the  Appellants'  appeals  against
    the Respondent's decision refusing to grant them  asylum  or  recognise
    that their removal would result in a breach of their human rights.





 2.  The  Appellants  appealed  against  that  decision  and  were  granted
    permission to appeal by Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor. The grounds upon
    which permission was granted may be summarised as follows:


      i) It is arguable that the judge erred in  his  consideration  of  the
         documentary evidence, in particular the  failure  to  consider  the
         evidence in the round prior to coming  to  the  conclusion  on  the
         credibility of the first Appellant's evidence at  paragraph  40  of
         the determination: that no weight was  placed  on  the  documentary
         evidence


     ii) It is arguable that the judge erred  in  failing  to  consider  the
         recent claimed facts when considering the alternative  position  of
         the Appellants, rendering that consideration inherently flawed.






 3. I was provided with a Rule 24 response from the Respondent.





    Error of Law


 4. At the close of submissions,  I  indicated  that  I  would  reserve  my
    decision, which I shall now give. I find that there was an error of law
    in the decision such that it should be set aside.  My  reasons  for  so
    finding are as follows.






 5. At �40  of  the  judge's  determination,  when  considering  the  first
    Appellant's credibility and core claim, the judge failed to engage with
    the background situation. It is correct that the  judge  discusses  the
    facts in 2011 earlier in the determination (see ��31 and  38),  however
    omits  consideration  of  those  events  in  assessing  credibility  by
    referring to the last event as occurring  in  2001.  However,  this  is
    plainly not so given that the wounding occurred in 2011 and  represents
    the last claimed incident.





 6. There is also mention of failure to engage with the  first  killing  in
    1997 as the starting point for the blood feud. The age of the  children
    and entry into teenage years is also not dealt with as well as the risk
    to the appellants as children and the future risk  they  face.  I  find
    that these points have force and compound the earlier error in relation
    to the omission of the 2011 incidents. Whilst the Respondent's Rule  24
    reply states that the judge's error at �40 is rectified at �41, I agree
    with Mr Burrett that this alternate consideration is flawed as it omits
    consideration of the 2011 events, which is corroborated by �44  of  the
    determination which confirms that the last killing was  over  14  years
    ago and that no recent incident occurred which represents an  incorrect
    alternate assessment of the Appellants' claimed account.





 7. I also  find  that  the  documentary  evidence  should  not  have  been
    overlooked in  the  manner  which  it  unfortunately  appears  to  have
    occurred.  The  judge  needed  to  consider  the  documentary  evidence
    regardless of the Appellant's credibility as the documents were of some
    significance and included death certificates,  newspaper  articles  and
    apparently a DVD depicting the funerals in 2002. Although this  finding
    is tempered by the fact that the newspaper article of 6 May 2011  which
    allegedly referred to Mr I K at page  150  of  the  Appellant's  bundle
    appears to be in Albanian. Nonetheless, I am just persuaded  that  this
    second independent ground represents a material error.



 8. In the light of the above findings, I set aside the decision and
    findings of the judge in totality.





    Decision

 9. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.




10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the appeal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal,  to  be  heard  by  a  differently
    constituted bench.


    Anonymity

11. The anonymity order of the First-tier Tribunal is maintained.
