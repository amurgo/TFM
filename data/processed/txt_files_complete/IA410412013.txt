For the Appellant:           Mr Khan, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Kenny, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Brazil date of birth 24th February 1976.
    On the 6th May 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Blake) dismissed her
    appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse to issue her with  a
    residence card confirming her right of residence under the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 as a family  member  who  has
    retained a right of residence.



    Background and Matters in Issue

 2. The Appellant's case was that she had  been  married  to  a  Portuguese
    national, a Mr Everton Luis Debrassi.  They  had  married  on  the  9th
    March 2007 and had lived together in  the  UK  since  then.  They  were
    separated in 2011 and were finally divorced on the 13th June 2013.  She
    asserts that she is a  family  member  who  has  retained  a  right  of
    residence with reference to Regulation 10(5) & (6) of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006:


         (5) A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if-


         (a) he ceased to be a family member of a qualified person on the
         termination of the marriage or civil partnership of the qualified
         person;


         (b) he was residing in the United Kingdom in accordance with these
         Regulations at the date of the termination;


         (c) he satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and


         (d) either-


              i) prior to the initiation of the proceedings for the
                 termination of the marriage or the civil partnership the
                 marriage or civil partnership had lasted for at least three
                 years and the parties to the marriage or civil partnership
                 had resided in the United Kingdom for at least one year
                 during its duration;
             ii) ....


          (6) The condition in this paragraph is that the person-


         (a) is not an EEA national but would, if he were an EEA national,
         be a worker, a self-employed person or a self-sufficient person
         under regulation 6; or
         (b) is the family member of a person who falls within paragraph
         (a).

 3. Under Regulation 15 (1)(f) a family member who has retained a right  of
    residence who has resided in the UK in accordance with the  Regulations
    for a continuous period of five years shall be  entitled  to  permanent
    residence in the UK.


 4. The Respondent accepted that this was the applicable law, but not  that
    the Appellant could show that she met these criteria. In particular the
    refusal letter of 23rd September 2013 stated that she had not  provided
    sufficient evidence to  show  that  her  ex-husband  was  a  'qualified
    person' at the termination of marriage, or that she had been working in
    the UK.

 5. On the 9th May 2014 the matter came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Judge Blake recorded that the  Appellant  was  not  in  attendance.  Mr
    Kotas, the Home Office Presenting Officer, informed  him  that  he  had
    spoken with Ms S Njaka, the Appellant's legal representative,  who  had
    informed him that neither she nor the Appellant would be attending  and
    the matter should be dealt with on the papers. In  those  circumstances
    Mr Kotas relied on the reasons  for  refusal  letter  and  Judge  Blake
    determined the appeal  on  the  documentary  evidence  before  him.  He
    dismissed the appeal for lack of evidence, noting at paragraph 34  that
    he had not had the benefit of hearing from the Appellant.

 6. The grounds of appeal were  drafted  by  the  Appellant  without  legal
    advice. She contends that she should have had an oral hearing and  that
    she was "deceived" by Mr  Kotas,  in  effect  being  tricked  into  not
    attending the hearing. The Appellant's understanding of events is  that
    Mr Kotas had contacted her legal  representative  the  day  before  the
    hearing and told her that he could not prepare the case. He is  alleged
    to have asked Ms Njaka whether she would  take  instructions  from  the
    Appellant  about  whether  she  would  be  happy  to  have  the  matter
    determined on the papers; if not he would apply for an  adjournment  on
    the basis that he was not in a position to prosecute the case.

 7. In granting permission on the papers Judge Hemingway of the  First-tier
    Tribunal correctly observed that  these  grounds  do  not  disclose  an
    arguable error of law in the determination. They are a criticism of the
    conduct of the HOPO.  Even if it could be established that Mr Kotas did
    in some way behave improperly, the grounds contain  a  tacit  admission
    that the Appellant consented to having the  matter  determined  on  the
    papers.   The Upper Tribunal cannot intervene in a decision  that  does
    not involve the making of  an  error  on  a  point  of  law[1].   Judge
    Hemingway was however prepared to grant permission for another  reason,
    that being that the reasoning in the determination is "very brief"  and
    it is arguable in those circumstances that the Appellant is not in  the
    position to know why she has lost.

 8. For the Respondent Ms Kenny contended that the documentary evidence was
    not sufficient for the appeal to have been allowed. In particular  even
    if the Tribunal had looked at the material before it  in  more  detail,
    there was no proof that the Appellant's ex-husband was working.

 9. The Appellant had provided a good deal of documentary evidence in  this
    case. In respect of her own residence and  employment  in  the  UK  she
    produced P60s for each year between 2007 and  2013,  numerous  payslips
    from various employers and bank statements showing deposits of  salary.
    In respect of her ex-husband Mr Debrassi there was a letter from a Mr

    There  were  also  receipts  for  payment/  payslips   from   "Ravenada
    Logistics" made out to Mr  Debrassi  during  2011,  and  some  payslips
    showing him to have been employed  by  'Mizuho  International'.   I  am
    satisfied that  none  of  this  evidence  has  been  addressed  by  the
    determination. It may have been limited in its scope, but it was before
    the Tribunal, and this evidence therefore required assessment.  I  find
    that the determination is flawed for this reason and it is set aside.


    The Re-made Decision

10. The relevant date for the purpose of Regulation 10 (5) is the  date  of
    divorce, that being the legal termination of the marriage.  The divorce
    was on the 13th June 2013.


11. I find as fact that the Appellant has been working in the UK in and  so
    meets the requirements of Regulation 10(6)(a). She has  provided  P60s,
    payslips and copies of her bank statements showing her salary paid in.


12. In respect of Mr Debrassi I heard oral evidence  from  the  Appellant's
    brother Mr Raveneda.  He  confirmed  that  he  was  the  proprietor  of
    Raveneda Logistics, the company which formerly  employed  Mr  Debrassi,
    and issued the payslips -  or  payment  receipts  -   produced  in  the
    evidence.  He said that it was a  car  recovery  business.  They  would
    collect cars for scrap. Whether he asked Mr Debrassi to help out varied
    from week to week. If they were quiet he might  only  work  1-2  hours.
    Other weeks they were very busy and he might to  8-10  hours.   He  did
    this for about 2 years, from 2011-13. It was not a contract and he only
    worked when he was asked.   He did not have an hourly rate of pay,  but
    Mr Ravaneda would give him half of what he made the day/afternoon  that
    they worked together. He would pay him in cash, and make  out  payslips
    for the accounts at the end of the month. At the end of  June  2013  he
    paid him �325. In mid 2013 Mr Ravaneda decided to close the company. It
    was not making enough money. He informed Companies House but it took  a
    few weeks to wind it down after that. Mr Ravaneda went off  and  got  a
    job somewhere. He does not know what happened to Mr Debrassi.


13. I have considered all of the evidence in the round. I found Mr Ravaneda
    to be a credible and  straightforward  witness.  He  did  not  seek  to
    embellish his evidence nor exaggerate it, as one might have expected to
    see given that the Appellant is his sister. He confirmed, for instance,
    that some weeks Mr Debrassi only worked one or two hours  for  him.  In
    submissions Ms Kenny agreed that there is no minimum  amount  of  hours
    that a person needs to be working to be considered  "qualified".  I  am
    satisfied that  upon  termination  of  his  marriage  Mr  Debrassi  was
    employed by Ravaneda Logistics and that during that month he had earned
    �325.  On the balance of probabilities I am satisfied  that  he  was  a
    qualified person at the date of divorce.

      Decisions

14. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it is set aside.


15. I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
