                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria  born  on  9  January  1975.   He
    appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent dated 28 August 2014 to refuse to issue him with a residence
    card as a family member of an EEA national pursuant to the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  (the  '2006  Regulations').
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson dismissed that appeal.

 2. Upper Tribunal Judge Deans, granted the appellant permission to  appeal
    to the stating that there was evidence before the  Judge  showing  that
    the couple were living together in a durable relationship from May 2005
    until  March  2014.  The  Judge  should  have  considered  whether  the
    appellant acquired a right of permanent residence prior to  March  2014
    and that this was the only arguable ground.

 3. The matter came before me for hearing on 12 May 2015.

 4. The Judge identified the two issues in the appeal. The first one  being
    that he has to determine whether between 14 August 2009 and  14  August
    2014, the appellant and his sponsor were in a durable relationship. The
    second issue was whether the appellants sponsor was  exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom. He concluded that the  appellant  has  to
    therefore prove under Regulation 15 of the 2006  Regulations  that  the
    appellant was living as a  family  member  with  his  sponsor  who  was
    exercising treaty rights.

 5. The Judge stated by virtue of Regulation seven (7) he was  only  to  be
    treat as the appellant sponsor's family member during the  currency  of
    his residence card and so long as he complied with Regulation 8 (5). He
    further advised himself that in order to be entitled to permanent right
    of residence, the appellant had to  be  residing  as  a  family  member
    during those five years.

 6. The Judge set out the evidence before him. He stated that the appellant
    arrived in the United Kingdom on  5  September  2004  and  subsequently
    began living with his  partner  Anne  Onsoien,  a  Norwegian  national.
    Following a successful appeal to the Asylum and  immigration  Tribunal,
    the  appellant  was  granted  a  residence  document  under   the   EEA
    Regulations valid from 14 August 2009 until 14 August 2014. On  4  July
    2014 the appellant applied for a residence  card  on  the  basis  of  a
    permanent right of residence  which  application  was  refused  by  the
    respondent on 28 August 2014.

 7. He stated that is starting point for his determination is the  previous
    decision of Judge Grant-Hutchinson promulgated on 29 June  2007.  Judge
    Grant Hutchinson accepted that at  that  time  the  couple  were  in  a
    durable relationship. He stated that in accordance  with  the  case  of
    Devaseelan this finding is his starting point. The Judge noted  in  his
    determination, that there was sufficient evidence before  Judge  Grant-
    Hutchinson upon which she concluded that the couple were in  a  durable
    relationship at that time and that finding was effectively given  force
    when a residence card was issued in August 2014 to the  appellant.  The
    Judge stated, "I proceed therefore on the basis that as at August  2014
    the appellant and his sponsor were in a durable relationship."

 8. The judge stated  in  his  determination,  "For  the  purpose  of  this
    determination  I  will  accept  that  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor
    continued live together in a relationship at various addresses  between
    2009 and  March  2014  because  there  is  sufficient  documents  which
    demonstrates this. There is also other evidence to indicate  that  this
    couple were in a durable relationship between 2009 and March 2014.

 9. The Judge however stated that this  was  not  the  end  of  the  matter
    because the real issue in this case is whether the  appellant  and  his
    sponsor were in a durable relationship between March  2014  and  August
    2014.

10. The Judge said that it is important  to  take  into  account  the  past
    history of that relationship. The evidence shows that the  relationship
    came to an end in March 2014 when the sponsor moved  out  of  the  shed
    home. Since that time the couple became "an ex-couple  not  an  ongoing
    couple". The Judge found that there appellant and his sponsor were  not
    in a durable relationship during the period of March 2 August 2014.  He
    however accepts that they  are  in  the  durable  relationship  between
    August 2009 and March 2014.

11. The Judge found that looking at the evidence in the  round,  there  was
    sufficient evidence to show on a balance of  probability  and  for  the
    purpose of this determination that treaty rights were  being  exercised
    by the sponsor. This however becomes  academic  because  the  appellant
    does not succeed under Regulation 15 (1 (b) because of  the  durability
    point.

12. The appellant's grounds of appeal argue  as  follows.   The  first-tier
    Judge found that the EEA national had been exercising treaty rights  at
    paragraph 68 but concluded that the appellant could not  show  that  he
    had resided as a family member of an  EEA  national  for  a  continuous
    period of five years.  At  paragraph  61,  the  Judge  found  that  the
    appellant could show that he had resided as a family member of  an  EEA
    national for 4 ï¿½ years but no more. The Judge based this finding on the
    fact that the couple had stopped living together  in  March  2014.  The
    Judge materially erred in  law  in  failing  to  consider  whether  the
    appellant qualified for permanent residence on the basis of  historical
    facts. The appellant relies  on  the  case  of  Idezuna  (EEA-permanent
    residence) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00474 (IAC).

13. It is sufficient to show that the appellant  sponsor  exercised  treaty
    rights for over five continuous years since the day it  was  determined
    that he had been in a durable relationship with her  to  avoid  unequal
    treatment of married and unmarried partners as set out in the  case  of
    the State of the Netherlands v and Florence Reed [1986] EU ECJR 59 /85.

14. The Judge referred to paragraph 5 where  Judge  Grant-Hutchinson  found
    that the appellant and his partner had  been  residing  together  since
    2006 /2007 and accepted at paragraph 52  that  the  appellant  and  his
    partner continued  to  live  together  in  a  relationship  at  various
    addresses between 2009  and  March  2014.  The  Judge  also  relied  on
    Regulation 7(3) to limit his consideration of the period  of  residence
    card. This is a material error of law because  that  Regulation  simply
    sets out the circumstances when an extended family  who  has  residence
    card shall be treated as a family member. (Emphasis added). Insofar  as
    Regulation 7 (3) attempts to impose a precondition or requirement of  a
    residence card in order to exercise rights of  residence  or  permanent
    residence it is submitted there is no such requirement in the Directive
    and such a condition is expressly contrary  to  and  incompatible  with
    Article 25.

15. In her rule 24 response, the respondent stated that she does not oppose
    the appellant's application for permission to appeal on  the  basis  of
    historical facts, namely whether the appellant had already  acquired  a
    right of permanent residence before the date  of  separation  from  his
    sponsor. The respondent invites the Tribunal to  determine  the  appeal
    with a fresh oral continuance hearing to consider whether the appellant
    meets the requirements of the Regulations 15 of the 2006 Regulations.

16. At the hearing I heard submissions from  the  appellant's  counsel  and
    Senior Presenting Officer said that he would leave  the  matter  in  my
    hands.

17. I find that there is an error of law in the determination of the First-
    tier Tribunal in relation to the application of the  2006  Regulations.
    The  Judge  accepted  that  there  was  sufficient  evidence  that  the
    appellant and his  sponsor  were  in  a  durable  relationship  when  a
    residence card was issued by the respondent to the appellant in  August
    2014. He stated "I proceed therefore on the basis  that  as  at  August
    2014, the appellant and his sponsor were in a durable relationship."

18. Having found that the appellant and the sponsor had been in  a  durable
    relationship, he nevertheless  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons which are erroneous in  law.  The  appellant  historically  had
    acquired a right of permanent residence before the date  of  separation
    from his sponsor as he lived with his sponsor from May 2005 until March
    2014 on the bases which he was previously issued with a residence  card
    by the respondent. The Judge  accepted  that  the  first-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Nicholson's  determination  at  paragraph  52  found  that   the
    appellant and his partner "continued to live together in a relationship
    at various addresses between 2009 and March 2014.

19. The Judge did not take into account the case of Idezuna  where  it  was
    stated "What constitutes the relevant period, (of  residence)  however,
    may be a matter requiring  particular  consideration  and  sometimes  a
    family member may have acquired a right of permanent residence  on  the
    basis of historical facts". The Judge did not consider the  appellant's
    historical residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  when  there  was  clear
    evidence before him of this historical residence.

20. Therefore it was a matter of fact before the Judge that  the  appellant
    and his partner resided together in a  durable  relationship  for  over
    five years and that the EEA national had  been  exercising  her  treaty
    rights during this entire period. Once a right of  permanent  residence
    has been acquired, it can be lost only through  the  absence  from  the
    host Member State  "for  a  period  exceeding  two  consecutive  years"
    (Regulation 15(2)  of  the  2006  Regulations;  Article  16(4)  of  the
    Directive).

21. The 2006 Regulations were made to implement Directive 2004/38/EC of the
    European Parliament and the Council (the "2004 Directive").   The  2006
    Regulations repealed and replaced earlier legislation dealing with  the
    immigration rights of  EEA  nationals  and  their  family  members,  in
    particular the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2000
    (S.I. 2000/2326) (the "2000 Regulations").  The 2004 Directive in  turn
    replaced the previous EC legislation in this field, to which  the  2000
    Regulations previously gave effect.  One of the features  of  the  2004
    Directive was the introduction of a permanent right of residence  in  a
    host member State.   Such  a  right  of  permanent  residence  was  not
    provided for in the 2000 Regulations or in the earlier EC legislation.

22. Regulation 15(1) of the 2006 Regulations provides that  "The  following
    persons shall acquire  the  right  to  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom
    permanently", followed by a list of  relevant  categories  of  persons.
    The only categories potentially  relevant  to  the  appellant  are  the
    category referred to in Regulation 15(1)(b), namely "a family member of
    an EEA national who is not himself an EEA national but who has  resided
    in the United Kingdom with the EEA national in  accordance  with  these
    Regulations for a continuous period of five years",  and  the  category
    referred to in paragraph 15(1)(f), namely "a person who-(i) has resided
    in the United Kingdom  in  accordance  with  these  Regulations  for  a
    continuous period of five years; and (ii)  was,  at  the  end  of  that
    period, a family member who has retained the right of residence".

23. There is ample evidence provided by the appellant that the appellant is
    entitled to a residence card on the basis that the  appellant  and  his
    sponsor were living together in a durable relationship  from  May  2005
    until March 2014 and therefore the appellant  had  already  acquired  a
    right of permanent residence in the  United  Kingdom  which  cannot  be
    taken away from him other than an absence of more than two  years  from
    the United Kingdom.

24. The Judge took no issue  that  the  appellant  sponsor  was  exercising
    treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

25. I therefore set aside the decision of the first-tier Tribunal Judge  in
    its entirety as it contains various errors of law both in fact and law.
    I substitute my decision and allow the appeal.

DECISION

I allow the appeal under the 2006 Regulations.
