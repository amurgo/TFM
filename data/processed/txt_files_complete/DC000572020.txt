                            DECISION AND REASONS

Decision and reasons

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  against  her
    decision on 20 March 2019 to deprive him of his British citizen status,
    which was obtained on the basis that he was a Kosovo citizen.

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Albania and his  British  citizenship  was
    obtained by fraud.

Background

 3. The claimant was born in K�kes, Albania in May 1972.  He arrived in the
    United Kingdom in September 1998, claiming to be a Kosovan citizen with
    the same name, but born in  Skenderaj,  Pristina  in  June  1969.   The
    claimant was granted exceptional leave to remain in August  1999.   His
    asylum claim, made promptly, was suspended for 12 months pursuant to  a
    policy for exceptional leave to remain for the large number  of  asylum
    claimants arriving from Kosovo at the time.

 4. The claimant applied for  further  discretionary  leave  to  remain  in
    August 2000, when his initial exceptional leave to remain expired,  and
    in July 2001, he attended his  asylum  interview.   He  maintained  his
    false identity for both the application and the interview.  On  7  July
    2004, the Secretary of State refused him international protection.

 5. The claimant did not make any further application, nor did he admit his
    actual nationality and date  of  birth.   He  remained  in  the  United
    Kingdom  without  leave  until  in  December  2007,  he   completed   a
    questionnaire seeking indefinite  leave  to  remain  under  the  legacy
    scheme, a backlog exercise to deal with asylum seekers and  others  who
    had remained in the  United  Kingdom  for  a  long  time.   He  gave  a
    different date of birth, in July 1969 not June 1969, but maintained his
    Kosovan identity.

 6. The  legacy  application  was  successful.  The  claimant  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain on 25 February 2010, and on 23  March  2010,
    he applied for a travel document, using the June 1969  birth  date  and
    continuing to assert his false Kosovan nationality.

 7.  The  claimant  applied  for  British  citizen  status,   signing   the
    nationality declaration on the form in the false Kosovan identity.   On
    23 July 2012, he was issued with a certificate of naturalisation.

 8. A copy of the claimant's British citizenship application  is  provided.
    He gave false details of his own and his parents' nationality and place
    of birth, as well as a false date of birth for himself. In Section 3 of
    the application, Good  Character  Requirement,  the  claimant  at  3.12
    asserted that he had  never  engaged  in  any  activities  which  might
    indicate that he may not be considered a person of good character.   In
    the box for further details, he did not admit his nationality fraud. At
    question  1.9  in  Section  1  (Personal  Information)  he   said   his
    nationality was Kosovan.  At 1.23 and 1.28,  he  said  his  father  and
    mother were born in Pristina,  Kosovo.  In  the  section  on  residence
    requirements, he said he had travelled to Albania for a  holiday  twice
    in 2010, and once in 2011, visiting relatives.   He  had  also  visited
    Podgorica, Montenegro, in 2010.

 9. Copies of the entry clearance application for his father and his mother
    showed that they recorded both their own and their son's nationality as
    Albanian, not Kosovan as his British citizen application stated.

10. The Secretary of State also produced the response on 2 August 2019 from
    the British Embassy in Tirana, Albania, to her request for  nationality
    information about this claimant.  It says that  there  is  an  Albanian
    national registered on the National Civil Register of Albania, to  whom
    no Albanian biometric passport or identity card had  yet  been  issued.
    That  person  was  born  in  Vranisht,  K�kes,  Albania.   His  present
    registered address remained Vranisht.

11. The claimant never volunteered to the Secretary of State  that  he  had
    relied on a false nationality.  The fraud came to light in August  2019
    when the Secretary of  State  carried  out  checks  with  the  Albanian
    Ministry of the Interior through the British Embassy in  Tirana,  which
    found no person in that name and date of birth born in Kosovo,  but  an
    individual with the date of  birth  in  1972  and  his  name,  born  in
    Albania.  His parents' entry clearance applications  also  stated  that
    the claimant was Albanian.

12. The claimant accepts that he used a false identity for 12  years  after
    arriving in the United Kingdom but contends that his  misrepresentation
    was immaterial to the decision to grant him British citizen status.

13. The Secretary of State wrote  to  the  claimant  on  4  February  2020,
    advising him that she was considering deprivation of  citizenship.   He
    was given an opportunity to respond, which he did  not  take.  However,
    the day after the Secretary of State's letter, the claimant applied for
    a British passport giving his place of birth as K�kes, Albania.

14. On 20 March  2020,  the  Secretary  of  State  wrote  to  the  claimant
    depriving him of his British citizen status,  on  the  basis  that  his
    application for naturalisation would have been refused under section  2
    (character generally) and section  9  (deception)  of  her  Nationality
    Instructions.

15. The Secretary of State said that  the  misrepresentation  was  material
    because the initial grant of exceptional leave to remain would not have
    been made had she known he was Albanian  and  thus  all  the  residence
    accrued thereafter would not have occurred, and the claimant would have
    been unable to meet the mandatory residence requirements.

16. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

17. The claimant gave oral evidence to the First-tier Tribunal.   At  [26],
    the judge found that his misrepresentation as to his place of birth was
    material to the decision to grant him exceptional leave to remain under
    a policy specifically for persons from Kosovo.  The  claimant's  asylum
    claim and application for further leave to remain were both outstanding
    when the legacy claim was made and considered.

18. The First-tier Judge considered the Secretary of State's policy and the
    core of his reasoning is at [38]-[39] of the decision:

         "38. I accept Ms Foot's submission that many people whose claims to
         remain had been refused, even where they  have  been  found  to  be
         completely untruthful, were  granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain
         under the legacy exercise.

         39.  I find that the grant of indefinite leave to  remain  was  not
         made as a consequence of the grant of exceptional leave to  remain.
         While I accept that had the [Secretary of  State]  known  that  the
         [claimant] was  from  Albania,  she  would  not  have  granted  him
         exceptional leave to remain, and he would have been  liable  to  be
         removed, there is no guarantee that the [Secretary of State]  would
         have in fact removed him, either then or at any point up until  she
         granted him indefinite leave to remain.  This is supported  by  the
         fact that the need for the legacy  exercise  arose  directly  as  a
         result of the large number of  unresolved  cases/large  numbers  of
         people whose initial claims had been refused, but who  remained  in
         the United Kingdom.  Moreover, the [Secretary of State] was  unable
         to remove the [claimant] while  any  application/asylum  claim  was
         pending.  I have already set out the origin of  the  legacy  scheme
         above.  Many of the people who were eventually  granted  indefinite
         leave to remain under the legacy  exercise,  where  they  had  been
         refused asylum  or  other  leave,  even  where  their  claims  were
         completely false."

19. The judge considered  Sleiman  (deprivation  of  citizenship:  conduct)
    [2017] UKUT 00367 (IAC), noting that the  impugned  behaviour  must  be
    directly material to the decision to grant citizenship.  He  considered
    that the claimant's circumstances were similar to those of Mr  Sleiman,
    who  had  lied  about   his   age.     The   judge   found   that   the
    misrepresentation was not material to the grant of indefinite leave  to
    remain and hence the grant of naturalisation.

20. The First-tier Judge allowed the claimant's appeal.  The  Secretary  of
    State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

21. On 29 July 2020, First-tier Judge  Chohan  granted  permission  on  the
    basis that the assertion in the grounds of appeal that  the  judge  had
    erred in finding that the claimant's deception was  immaterial  to  the
    grant of indefinite leave  to  remain  and  subsequent  naturalisation,
    'must be explored further' and that it was open to  argument  that  the
    judge might have erred in his approach.

Rule 24 Reply

22. On 3 November 2020, significantly out of time, Ms Foot filed a Rule  24
    Reply to the grant of permission.  Counsel observed that no  directions
    had been received 'requiring a Rule 24 response to be filed and  served
    by any particular date'.   Ms Foot appears unaware of the 1-month  time
    limit in Rule 24(2)(b) in the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
    2008 (as amended):  no additional direction is required.

23. On this occasion, I have admitted the submissions made, not as  a  Rule
    24 Reply but by as a skeleton argument for the hearing.

24. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

25. For the Secretary of State, Mr Clarke confirmed that this was a 'single
    identity' deception.  The question of nullity  had  never  arisen.   He
    asserted that the fraud was  relevant  to  the  grant  of  citizenship,
    relying on the Secretary of State's policy underpinning  the  grant  of
    both indefinite leave to remain under the  legacy  scheme  and  on  her
    policy on the grant of citizenship.  The claimant would not  have  been
    granted either, had the Secretary of  State  been  aware  that  he  was
    Albanian, not Kosovan.

26. Mr Clarke drew the Tribunal's attention to  the  Secretary  of  State's
    guidance on the Good Character part of the citizenship application, and
    in particular, the instructions as to  how  paragraph  3.12  should  be
    completed:

         "3.12    You must say whether you have been  involved  in  anything
         which might indicate that you are not of good character.  You  must
         give information about any of these activities, no matter how  long
         ago it was. Checks will be made in all cases and  your  application
         may fail and your fee will not be fully refunded  if  you  make  an
         untruthful declaration.  If you are in any doubt about whether  you
         have done something, or it has been  alleged  that  you  have  done
         something, which might lead us to think that you are  not  of  good
         character, you should say so.

         You must tell us if you have practised deception in  your  dealings
         with the Home Office  or  other  Government  Departments  (e.g.  by
         providing false information or fraudulent documents).  This will be
         taken into  account  in  considering  whether  you  meet  the  good
         character requirement.  If your application is refused,  and  there
         is clear evidence of the deception,  any  future  application  made
         within 10 years is unlikely to be successful. ..."

         [Emphasis added]

27. The claimant would have known full well that he had lied in his  legacy
    application, and in his naturalisation application, but the  judge  had
    not taken account of these answers at [15] of his decision nor set  out
    the falsehoods in the British citizen status application which amounted
    to deliberate misrepresentation.

28. The judge had erred in applying Sleiman to this  appeal.   That  appeal
    had turned  on  whether  a  person's  age  was  relevant  to  a  legacy
    application, and delay had been a deciding factor in  the  appeal.   In
    Sleiman, the Secretary of State had not argued that the  naturalisation
    itself was tainted by the deception as to the appellant's age.

29. In the present appeal, the First-tier Tribunal had  accepted  that  the
    claimant's fraud was material to the grant of exceptional  leave.   The
    claimant had then been granted indefinite leave  to  remain,  and  that
    gave him the attributes to apply  for  British  citizen  status.    The
    claimant had been refused asylum in 2004 but had not been  removed  and
    his legacy claim, made in 2007, ensured that he was not  removed  until
    it was decided.

30. The Secretary of State would rely on RN  (Sri  Lanka)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 938.  The  legacy  scheme
    was not an amnesty, but an administrative device to deal with  a  large
    backlog.  It did not confer rights.  In Hakemi v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1967 (Admin) at [6],  the  court  noted
    that  caseworkers  were  required  to  take  into   account   paragraph
    395(c)(iv) of the Rules and that character was always in play.

31. As to ground 4, the instructions to caseworkers began  by  saying  that
    the Secretary of State's policy was to remove  those  who  entered  the
    United Kingdom unlawfully, save  for  certain  exceptions.   They  were
    required to take into account deception, or attempts to  frustrate  the
    process.  It was irrelevant to consideration of the  claimant's  status
    whether he would in fact have been removed at any particular time.

32. The First-tier Judge at [39] was therefore wrong in both fact and  law:
    the claimant would not have been granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain
    under  the  legacy  programme,  had  he  told  the  truth  about   this
    nationality.  The Secretary of State would  rely  on  HB  (Ethiopia)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1713  for
    what it said about delay.

33. In conclusion, Mr Clarke asserted that there  was  a  direct  causative
    link between the claimant's asserted  fraudulent  nationality  and  the
    grant of both indefinite leave to remain and  British  citizen  status.
    The Upper Tribunal should set aside  the  decision  and  remake  it  by
    dismissing the appeal.

34. For the Upper Tribunal hearing, Ms Foot's instructing solicitors served
    a skeleton argument (the out of time Rule 24 Reply) and copies of three
    decisions: Sleiman (deprivation of citizenship:  conduct)  [2017]  UKUT
    00367 (IAC); AA (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2020] EWCA Civ 1296; and Hakemi and others v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2012] EWHC 1967 (Admin).

35. In the Rule 24  reply,  Ms  Foot  for  the  claimant  argued  that  the
    Secretary of State's grounds of appeal are no more than an  attempt  to
    re-argue the substantive case before the First-tier Tribunal and do not
    meet the threshold for a decision that the First-tier Tribunal decision
    should be set aside:  see AA (Nigeria).

36. Ms Foot argued  that  the  claimant's  deception,  which  he  does  not
    dispute, was not material to the grant of indefinite leave to remain or
    citizenship to him and that therefore his citizenship as  not  obtained
    'by means of fraud'  as  required  by  section  40(3)  of  the  British
    Nationality Act 1981.

37. The claimant continued to rely on Sleiman, accepting that his deception
    was indirectly relevant, since character and conduct were  relevant  to
    the legacy criteria.  Deception 'bought' the  claimant  his  indefinite
    leave  to  remain  under  the  legacy  scheme.    The  good   character
    requirement  for  naturalisation  was  not  addressed  in  the  Sleiman
    decision but the claimant maintained that it was not directly  relevant
    to the grant of citizenship, having regard to the character guidance in
    force at the date of decision.

38. The claimant contended that the First-tier Judge's conclusion was  open
    to her and resulted from careful consideration of the relevant law  and
    guidance, applied to the facts of the  claimant's  case  and  that  the
    decision should be upheld.

39. In her oral submissions, Ms Foot argued that the Secretary  of  State's
    grounds of appeal disclosed no material error of law in the  First-tier
    Judge's decision. She accepted that the claimant's case was not on  all
    fours with Sleiman, but argued that it was analogous. Ms Foot  reminded
    me of the threshold for interference in AA (Nigeria) at [32]: the Upper
    Tribunal should not interfere with findings of fact by  the  First-tier
    Judge merely because it might have  made  a  different  decision.   The
    Secretary of State was asking the Upper Tribunal to reopen findings  of
    fact.  There was no perversity in the First-tier Judge's reasoning  and
    the grant of permission was at the lowest possible level:  'this  issue
    must be explored further'.  Mere complexity was not sufficient.

40. It was important to recall  that  the  question  was  not  whether  the
    claimant's past deception was material to the  legacy  criteria,  which
    plainly it was, but whether it was directly material, hence the analogy
    with Sleiman  in  which  also  the  deception  was  maintained  in  the
    application for citizenship, following which there was  a  delay  of  5
    years.  If Mr Clarke's  submissions  were  correct,  then  Sleiman  was
    wrongly decided.  This  claimant  had  long  residence,  and  his  past
    deception was not determinative.

41. The First-tier Judge's analysis was open to her  and  was  not  legally
    erroneous.  There  was  no  misdirection,  and  she  engaged  with  all
    relevant facts and matters.  In Hysaj, there had also been  nationality
    fraud leading directly to the grant of indefinite leave to remain.

42. The judge was entitled to find in this  case  that  the  deception  was
    factually immaterial to the grant of  leave  and  that  she  failed  to
    engage with the argument before her about the  relevance  of  fraud  to
    character.

43. In response, Mr Clarke acknowledged that the claimant had  no  criminal
    history, but that the  Secretary  of  State  had  not  been  given  the
    opportunity to take into account the factors  which  mitigated  against
    the effect of his fraud, because the claimant had maintained his  fraud
    in the citizenship application. The  claimant  had  lied  on  both  the
    legacy   and   naturalisation    applications.      Such    fraud    or
    misrepresentation should count heavily against him in consideration  of
    the naturalisation application.

The statutory framework

44. Section 40(3) of the 1981 Act gives the Secretary of State the power to
    deprive a person of citizenship in certain circumstances:

         "40. ... (3)  The Secretary of State may by order deprive a person
                of a citizenship status which results from his registration
                or naturalisation if the Secretary of State is satisfied
                that the registration or naturalisation was obtained by
                means of-

                    (a)    fraud,

                    (b)    false representation, or

                    (c)    concealment of a material fact."

45. The claimant's misrepresentation of his date and place  of  birth,  and
    his nationality, and of his parents' place of  birth  and  nationality,
    can be characterised as fraud and false  representation,  but  also  as
    concealment of a material fact, his real Albanian nationality.

RN (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA  Civ
938

46. In RN, Lord Justice Maurice Kay, with whom Lord Justice Floyd and  Lady
    Justice Sharp agreed, said at [24] that  the  Legacy  Scheme  'did  not
    confer additional substantive rights on the Legacy cohort.  Its purpose
    was administrative and organisational.  It bore no  resemblance  to  an
    amnesty. ...'.  One would expect, therefore, that  full  disclosure  of
    all relevant circumstances would be made in an  application  under  the
    Legacy Scheme.

Hakemi v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2013]  EWHC  1967
(Admin)

47. In 2012, in Hakemi and others, Mr Justice Burton set out extracts  from
    Chapter 53 of the Secretary of  State's  Enforcement  Instructions  and
    Guidance, including the following material passages:

         "53. Extenuating circumstances

         It is the policy of the Agency to remove  those  persons  found  to
         have entered the United Kingdom unlawfully, unless it  would  be  a
         breach of the Refugee Convention or ECHR or  there  are  compelling
         reasons, usually of a compassionate nature, for not doing so in  an
         individual case. ...

         (ii) Residence  accrued  as  a  result  of  non-compliance  by  the
         individual

         Where there is evidence of an attempt by the  individual  to  delay
         the decision making process, frustrate  removal  or  otherwise  not
         comply with any requirements imposed  upon  them,  then  this  will
         weigh against the individual. ..."

48. The judgment goes on to consider the  Secretary  of  State's  delay  in
    enforcing removal in that case, and delays in the legacy process.

Sleiman (deprivation of citizenship: conduct) [2017] UKUT 00367 ((IAC))

49. In 2017, in Sleiman, Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek gave the  following
    guidance in the judicial headnote:

         "In an  appeal  against  a  decision  to  deprive  a  person  of  a
         citizenship status, in assessing  whether  the  appellant  obtained
         registration  or  naturalisation  'by  means   of'   fraud,   false
         representation, or concealment of a  material  fact,  the  impugned
         behaviour must be  directly  material  to  the  decision  to  grant
         citizenship."

50. The appellant in Sleiman had  given  a  false  date  of  birth,  making
    himself three years younger than he actually was, and had been  granted
    discretionary leave to remain as a unaccompanied asylum-seeking  child,
    to expire the day before his presumed  18th  birthday.   The  appellant
    made an in-time application for further  leave  to  remain,  which  the
    Secretary of State did not deal with for 5 years.   His  situation  was
    then examined under the Legacy Scheme and  he  was  granted  indefinite
    leave to remain, and in due course, British citizen status, both  based
    on the incorrect date of birth.

51. The correct date of birth was discovered when the  appellant  got  into
    difficulty in China, having had to surrender his  British  passport  in
    Hong Kong.  He contacted the British Embassy and produced his  Lebanese
    passport with his correct, older date of birth in it.  There was a Home
    Office file note recording the two dates of birth but stating expressly
    that his age was irrelevant to the grant of indefinite leave to  remain
    under the Legacy Scheme.

52. At [53], Judge Kopieczek said this:

         "53. In the cases of obvious fraud, such as in relation to identity
         or nationality, it is much easier to see the causative link between
         the conduct of the appellant and the granting  of  citizenship.  In
         other cases the link may be less  clear.  Hence,  in  the  NI's  at
         55.7.13 a number of hypothetical examples are given,  described  as
         'Case Studies', in relation to whether or not consideration  should
         be given to action to deprive of citizenship."

                                                            [Emphasis added]

53. At [62]-[65], Judge  Kopieczek  explained  why  Mr  Sleiman's  age  was
    irrelevant to the grant of exceptional leave to remain under the Legacy
    Scheme, and thus to the grant of citizenship:

         "62. The appellant was granted ILR on 4 May 2010 under the 'Legacy'
         scheme. The deprivation decision states that "Your FLR  application
         was granted under legacy due to the length of time the  application
         was outstanding; your age was irrelevant" (quoted in full  at  [42]
         above). Mr Yeo, understandably, focuses on the asserted irrelevance
         of age to the respondent's decision to grant ILR. ...

         64.  It should be said that the skeleton argument that  was  before
         the FtJ does not refer to the 'age irrelevant' point, and it  seems
         the argument was not advanced in  submissions  before  him  either.
         That matter seems to have come to the fore  when  the  Home  Office
         file  note,  referred  to  at  [7]  above,  was  discovered.  After
         referring to the false date of birth in the asylum application, and
         that it was not thought appropriate that his citizenship should  be
         considered a nullity because the only change in detail was his date
         of birth, the file note states that the false date of birth allowed
         the  appellant  to  claim  asylum  as  a  minor.  It  then  states,
         materially, that "his ELR application was granted under legacy  due
         to  the  length  of  time  the  application  was  outstanding.  The
         subject's age was irrelevant". In its context of a consideration of
         the false date of birth, this could be taken to  suggest  or  imply
         that in fact the false date of birth was itself irrelevant  to  the
         decision to grant ILR.

         65.  Furthermore, it is not suggested by the  respondent  that  had
         the false date of birth been known  by  her  at  the  time  of  the
         citizenship application, the application would have  been  rejected
         on the ground that the appellant had not shown that he was of  good
         character."

54. Properly understood, Sleiman therefore requires a First-tier  Judge  to
    make a finding of fact as to whether there was a link between the grant
    of leave under the Legacy Scheme and/or the grant  of  British  citizen
    status, and the deception.  In Sleiman, the Secretary of  State's  file
    note stated that there was no link.  That  is  not  the  case  in  this
    appeal.

AA (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2020]  EWCA  Civ
1296

55. In AA (Nigeria)  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  warned  to  be  cautious  of
    interfering in the findings of fact and  credibility  of  a  First-tier
    Judge who has seen and heard an appellant give evidence.  Lord  Justice
    Popplewell, with whom  Lord  Justice  Moylan  and  Lord  Justice  Baker
    agreed, said this at [41]:

         "41. ... This appears to me  to  be  a  case  in  which  the  Upper
         Tribunal has interfered merely on  the  grounds  that  its  members
         would themselves have  reached  a  different  conclusion.  That  is
         impermissible.  I  appreciate  that  under  the  tribunal   system,
         established by the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act  2007  Act,
         the Upper Tribunal  is  itself  a  specialist  tribunal,  with  the
         function of ensuring that First-tier Tribunals adopt  a  consistent
         approach to the determination of questions of principle which arise
         under  the  particular  statutory  scheme  in  question  by  giving
         guidance on those questions of principle: see per Lord Carnwath JSC
         in the tax context in HMRC v Pendragon Ltd [2015] UKSC 37  at  [48]
         and Baroness Hale PSC in the immigration context in MM (Lebanon)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] 1 WLR 771 at [69]
         to [74]. However it is no part of such function to seek to restrict
         the range of reasonable views which may be reached by FTT Judges in
         the value judgments applied  to  the  many  different  private  and
         family life circumstances which make almost all cases in this  area
         different from each other. It is emphatically  not  part  of  their
         function to seek conformity by substituting their own views  as  to
         what the outcome should be  for  those  of  first  instance  judges
         hearing the evidence. As Baroness Hale PSC observed in  the  latter
         case at [107]:

             "107.    It is no doubt  desirable  that  there  should  be  a
             consistent approach to issues of this kind at tribunal  level,
             but as we have explained  there  are  means  to  achieve  this
             within  the  tribunal  system.  As  was  said  in  Mukarkar  v
             Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] Imm AR 57  ,
             para 40 (per Carnwath LJ):

                   "It is of the nature of  such  judgments  that  different
                  tribunals, without illegality or irrationality, may  reach
                  different conclusions on the same case ... The  mere  fact
                  that one tribunal has reached what may seem  an  unusually
                  generous view of the facts of a particular case  does  not
                  mean that it has made an error of  law  ...  Nor  does  it
                  create any precedent, so as  to  limit  the  Secretary  of
                  State's right to argue for a more restrictive approach  on
                  a similar case in the future. However, on the facts of the
                  particular case, the decision of the  specialist  tribunal
                  should be respected." "

56.  I remind myself also of the guidance in R (Iran) v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2-5] EWCA Civ 982, Lord Justice  Brooke  (with
    whom Lord Justice Chadwick and Lord Justice Maurice  Kay  agreed),  set
    out the narrow circumstances when  it  is  permissible  for  the  Upper
    Tribunal to interfere in the fact  found  by  a  First-tier  Judge,  at
    [90.2]-[90.3]:

         "90. ... 2. A finding might only be set aside for error of  law  on
         the grounds of perversity if it was irrational or  unreasonable  in
         the Wednesbury sense, or one that was  wholly  unsupported  by  the
         evidence.

         3. A decision should not be set aside  for  inadequacy  of  reasons
         unless the adjudicator failed to identify and  record  the  matters
         that were critical to his decision on material issues,  in  such  a
         way that the IAT was unable  to  understand  why  he  reached  that
         decision."

Analysis

57. The core factual matrix in this appeal is not disputed.   The  claimant
    does not deny that he used a false date and place  of  birth  (but  his
    real name) to enter the United Kingdom in 1998 and that  he  maintained
    that falsehood through  the  grant  of  exceptional  leave  to  remain,
    through the legacy consideration  from  which  he  obtained  indefinite
    leave to remain, and when he was granted British citizen status.

58. The claimant's nationality fraud was exposed only when the Secretary of
    State of her own motion caused the British Embassy in Tirana to  verify
    his date and place of birth with the Albanian authorities and when  she
    realised  that  the  claimant's  parents   had   each   made   separate
    applications for entry clearance in which they referred to  him  as  an
    Albanian citizen and gave a different place of birth and residence  for
    him, and for themselves.  The claimant then admitted his fraud.

59. The legal question, on which the appeal turns, is  the  materiality  of
    that continued falsehood to the grant of  indefinite  leave  to  remain
    under the legacy exercise, and  then  the  grant  of  citizenship,  and
    whether the First-tier Judge erred in law in finding that on the facts,
    the grant of citizenship to this claimant was not obtained 'by means of
    fraud' as required by section 40(3) of the 1981 Act.

60. At [26], the judge made a finding of fact that the misrepresentation as
    to the  claimant's  place  of  birth  was  material  to  the  grant  of
    exceptional leave to remain. But for his  claim  to  be  Kosovan,  that
    leave would not have been granted.

61. The judge found that when the legacy exercise was being considered, the
    claimant had an outstanding asylum claim in  his  Kosovan  nationality,
    and also an application for further leave to flow from the  exceptional
    leave to remain. He did not abscond, and he  attended  his  substantive
    asylum interview.   The judge found that the grant of indefinite  leave
    to  remain  under  the  legacy  exercise  was  not   tainted   by   the
    misrepresentation which led to his being granted exceptional  leave  to
    remain.  That may be a generous finding, but it was (just) open to  the
    judge on the facts as he stated them, having regard to  the  number  of
    persons with totally false claims who also  received  leave  to  remain
    under the Legacy Exercise.

62. It is when the judge came to apply Sleiman that she erred in  law.   In
    Sleiman, the eventual decision turned on the facts:  the  Secretary  of
    State produced, late in the day, a file note which said expressly  that
    the misrepresentation as to Mr Sleiman's age was not  relevant  to  the
    decision to grant him exceptional leave  to  remain  under  the  Legacy
    Exercise,  or  citizenship.  The  same  statement  was  made   in   the
    deprivation decision.

63. There was no such file note or statement in this  appeal.   The  First-
    tier Judge's assertion at [42] that  in  this  appeal  she  had  placed
    'significant weight on the [Secretary of State's] file note as set  out
    above' cannot be matched to any file note in the documents before me of
    the type considered in Sleiman, nor to anything 'above' in  the  First-
    tier Judge's decision.

64. The naturalisation application form provided  an  opportunity  for  the
    claimant to declare his previous deception to  give  the  Secretary  of
    State an opportunity to consider it  and  exercise  discretion  in  his
    favour.  He did not take that opportunity: he left the  box  blank  and
    did adjusted his own and his parents' nationality and place of birth to
    make it seem that they were all Kosovan.

65. Accordingly, the circumstances of this  claimant  are  much  closer  to
    example A, cited in the First-tier Judge's decision at  [44],  than  to
    example B, where indefinite leave to remain was granted under a  Family
    Concession  unrelated  to  his  misrepresentation  of  an   applicant's
    nationality, thereby interrupting the chain of causation from the fraud
    to the grant of naturalisation as a British citizen .

66. I remind myself that at [53] in Sleiman, Judge Kopieczek said this:

         "53. In the cases of obvious fraud, such as in relation to identity
         or nationality, it is much easier to see the causative link between
         the conduct of the appellant and the granting of citizenship. ..."

67. The claimant in this appeal committed just such an obvious  fraud.   On
    his application for citizenship, he misstated his own place and date of
    birth, his nationality, and the matching details for both his  parents.
    The fraud here was  clearly  operative  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to grant citizenship, and just  as  clearly  intentional:  the
    claimant altered only his date and place  of  birth  and  the  matching
    details for his parents,  while  leaving  his  visits  to  Albania  and
    Macedonia for holidays in the application uncorrected (perhaps  because
    he knew that they could be verified).

68. The First-tier Judge's decision contains a material error of law as  to
    the application of the Sleiman decision to the facts of this appeal and
    cannot stand.  The causative link here is established.  If  Sleiman  is
    correctly applied, there is only one possible outcome:  the  claimant's
    appeal must be dismissed.



DECISION

69. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by dismissing
    the claimant's appeal.
