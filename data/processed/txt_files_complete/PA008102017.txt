For the Appellant:     Mr J Bryce, Advocate, instructed by Anderson Rizwan,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge S
    Gillespie, promulgated on 22 June 2017.

 2. The grounds are (i) failure to have regard to all the relevant  medical
    evidence (the judge referred to only 1 of 5 medical reports)  and  (ii)
    failure to have regard to the Devaseelan guidelines (the judge observed
    only guidelines 1 - 3, and not 4 - 5).

 3. Mr Bryce argued as follows:

   i. Judge Gillespie approached the case by examining  whether  there  were
      reasons to differ from the findings in the determination by Judge  Lea
      promulgated on 1 February 2013.

  ii. Judge Lea did not accept that the appellant had been persecuted by her
      family in Pakistan.

 iii. Among the claims made by the appellant was  an  incident  on  6  March
      2011, leading to the conception two weeks before she left Pakistan  of
      her daughter, who was born in the UK.

  iv. The (alleged) perpetrator of the incident of 6 March 2011  was  not  a
      family member, so Judge Lea had made no finding on that issue.

   v. That issue was at large for Judge Gillespie, a new matter which he was
      bound to examine in light of all the evidence, including  the  medical
      reports which had not been before Judge Lea.

  vi. Abundant background material had been produced to show that PTSD was a
      likely outcome of such a traumatic event.  The  medical  evidence  was
      quite powerful, in particular a passage in a report by Dr Moore (p.214
      of the appellant's FtT bundle) on the effect on the appellant  and  on
      her attitude towards her daughter, a telling point.   Judge  Gillespie
      gave no separate consideration to that report.  He  (correctly)  cited
      authority on the limited role of such evidence in testing the truth of
      an account, but went on to decide the case only by  examining  whether
      there were reasons to differ from the findings in the determination by
      Judge Lea.  She had made no findings on this  issue.  It  should  have
      been resolved, and the bearing thereon of the medical evidence  should
      have been assessed.

 vii. The error was material, because the country guidance of the respondent
      (pp. 1 - 40 appellant's FtT bundle, �2.4.7  and  2.5.4)  supported  at
      least a possibility that if the appellant had proved her circumstances
      as claimed, she might have been found not returnable to Pakistan.

viii. The Judge failed to note that there were factual issues  not  resolved
      by the previous determination which he was not only entitled but bound
      to resolve.  This fell closest to Devaseelan guideline 3.   (The  same
      error of approach was in the respondent's decision.)

 4. Mr Bryce accepted my observation that his submissions  did  not  follow
    the line foreshadowed in the grounds, but he said that the grounds were
    broad enough to accommodate his argument.

 5. Mr Matthews waived any point about the submissions not arising from the
    grounds.   He  said  that  the  matter  turned  on   interpreting   the
    determination of Judge Lea, and argued thus:

   i. Judge Lea said at �37, "In the whole circumstances and given the other
      inconsistencies as narrated in the reasons for refusal  letter,  I  do
      not accept that the appellant has been persecuted  by  her  family  in
      Pakistan ...".

  ii. The question was whether that encompassed  the  incident  of  6  March
      2011.

 iii. The alleged perpetrator was not a family member.

  iv. Nevertheless, the appellant's account was narrated and evaluated as  a
      whole, including that incident.

   v. The appellant said she had been ill-treated from an early age  by  her
      step-mother.  She was farmed out as slave labour in  the  house  of  a
      family friend.  It was in that house that she  was  allegedly  abused.
      This was part of the overall claim of persecution in a family context.



  vi. In the account of the evidence by Judge Lea and  in  her  conclusions,
      the incident was inextricable.

 vii. Judge Lea comprehensively explained at �34 - 36 why the appellant  was
      not found a credible witness, setting out  major  inconsistencies  and
      other shortcomings over her circumstances and family situation, all of
      which were just as adverse to the incident of 6 March 2011,  a  matter
      which was not advanced for the appellant in isolation from the rest.

viii. No challenge had been made to the decision of Judge Lea on  the  basis
      that its adverse findings were incomplete, or otherwise flawed.

  ix. The appellant's account about any incident on 6 March 2011 had plainly
      been rejected.

   x. Judge's Gillespie's decision at  �19  ("voluminous  documentation  ...
      relating, among other things, to the nature of  PTSD")  and  22  ("the
      doctors who have examined her", plural)  was  sufficient,  and  showed
      that he was aware there was more than one report.  The PTSD  diagnosis
      came after Judge Lea's decision, rejecting the  incident  of  6  March
      2011.

  xi. The reasons given at �24 for holding that the  medical  evidence  took
      the appellant no further were pithy, but sufficient.

 6. Mr Bryce in reply said that the terms of the report by  Dr  Moore  gave
    cause for careful consideration.

 7. I reserved my decision.

 8.  Mr  Bryce's  interesting  and  ingenious  submission  was   that   the
    credibility of the alleged incident of  6  March  2011  was  for  Judge
    Gillespie to consider for the first time, in light equally of  evidence
    old and new, with no negative starting point.  That was arguable on the
    wording of �37 of the determination of Judge Lea, but  fully  examined,
    it is unsound.

 9. The determination by Judge Lea was not challenged for being incomplete.
     It was not suggested that the point now advanced had  been  stated  by
    the appellant as part of her fresh submissions.  It did  not  occur  to
    the author of the fresh decision.  It does not appear in the grounds of
    appeal to the FtT.  It might have been advanced to Judge Gillespie, but
    was not.  If it is in the grounds of appeal to the UT, it is in no more
    than embryonic form.

10. Putting �37 in context, Judge Lea intended her decision as a  rejection
    of the whole account, including its most serious element. It would have
    been a major error to make no finding thereon.  It has not occurred  to
    any of those who have been concerned with the  case  since  1  February
    2013 to read her decision any other way, until now.

11. �37 comes at the end of a section headed, "My findings  of  credibility
    and fact".  It is followed by a section headed, "My conclusions to this
    appeal", beginning at �38 with the sentence, "I have not  accepted  the
    appellant's account of past persecution in Pakistan".   The  Judge  did
    not distinguish between claims of persecution arising within the family
    and claims outside that context.  The alleged incident was  encompassed
    in the finding made.

12. Nothing turns on which of the Devaseelan guidelines is most closely  in
    point.

13. The grounds and submissions for the appellant  do  not  show  that  the
    making of the decision of Judge Gillespie involved the  making  of  any
    error on a point of law.

14. The decision of the FtT shall stand.

15. The FtT did not make  an  anonymity  direction.   The  matter  was  not
    addressed in the UT.  However, in view of the nature  of  the  case  in
    relation to a young child, I have decided to make such a direction.

16. Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify her or any member of her  family.   This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
