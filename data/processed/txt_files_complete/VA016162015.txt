Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr S Karim instructed by Hamlet Solicitors LLP.
For the Respondent: Mr S Walker Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. On 4 March 2015 the respondent refused  an  application  for  entry
        clearance to visit the United Kingdom for a period of 3 to 4 months
        by the above-named appellant. The purpose of the visit is  for  the
        appellant to see his spouse, daughter and other family  members  in
        the UK.
     2. The reason for refusal, set out in the decision under challenge, is
        in the following terms:


        "In your current application you state that you are  self-employed,
        trading as Rumena Store since 01/12/2000, earning �200  per  month.
        It also states you have additional income of  �90  per  month  from
        properties and rents. In  support  of  your  application  you  have
        submitted a trade licence and ownership of land receipts.  However,
        I am  not  satisfied  that  these  documents  demonstrate  yourself
        employment status and that you  have  the  income  levels  claimed.
        Given the above, I am not  satisfied  that  you  have  presented  a
        complete  and  accurate  picture  of  your  personal  and  economic
        circumstances in Bangladesh. I am therefore not satisfied that  you
        plan to leave the UK at the end of  your  visit  or  that  you  are
        genuinely seeking entry as a  general  visitor  for  a  period  not
        exceeding 6 months. (Paragraph 41 (i) (ii) of HC 395 as amended).



Discussion



     3. The only ground of appeal available to the appellant, in  light  of
        the date of the  decision  under  challenge,  is  on  human  rights
        grounds. It was accepted by both advocates that  the  tribunal  has
        jurisdiction to consider the appeal on this basis.
     4. There has been a  history  of  decisions  made  by  the  First-tier
        Tribunal dismissing the appeal being set aside,  most  recently  by
        Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan in a decision promulgated on 9  August
        2018.
     5. The matter was reserved to the Upper Tribunal and proceeds today on
        the basis this tribunal will substitute a decision to either  allow
        or dismiss the appeal.
     6. The appellant's wife attended to give oral  evidence.  Two  witness
        statements have been filed by  this  witness  the  first  dated  24
        October 2016 in which the witness confirms the appellant arrived in
        the United Kingdom with her on 24 February  2010  but  returned  to
        Bangladesh on 7 June 2010. Prior to that  he  had  arrived  in  the
        United Kingdom as  a  visitor  on  27  May  2007  and  returned  to
        Bangladesh on 5 September 2007 remaining on both  occasions  for  3
        months and 2 weeks. The witness states the appellant returned as he
        did not like to stay in the United Kingdom  permanent  leaving  his
        family behind in Bangladesh. At the  date  of  that  statement  the
        witness stated they have 3 daughters aged  21,  18  and  16  and  a
        married son aged  29  whom  the  appellant  was  looking  after  in
        Bangladesh and that unless and until they are married  it  was  not
        socially acceptable to leave them without a guardian permanently.
     7. The witness confirms the appellant runs a grocery store which  pays
        for the needs of the family making profits of about  �200  a  month
        together with rent from properties and that the family have a  good
        quality of life from that income. The witness states she asked  her
        husband to visit her in the United Kingdom as she cannot visit  him
        as a result of health needs as  a  result  of  which  she  receives
        Employment Support Allowance as a result of being unfit to work.
     8. The witness  states  she  is  "dying  to  see  her  husband  and  2
        daughters" who she has not met for 6 years and states the visit  is
        important to help her deal with her depression. The witness  states
        the appellant will return to Bangladesh after about 3 months as  he
        will not want to live in the United Kingdom permanently leaving the
        business and their daughters in Bangladesh.
     9. The witness states her husband submitted the same documents that he
        provided in 2007 and 2010 and that there  has  been  no  change  in
        circumstances.
    10. In a 2nd witness statement dated 2 February 2018 the witness states
        her personal circumstances have deteriorated and that she is now in
        receipt of Personal Independence  Payment  and  Employment  Support
        Allowance and needs help and supervision from her immediate  family
        members. The witness states that her daughter and  son-in-law  have
        been looking after her very well  and  make  sure  that  she  needs
        everything and that she has been allocated  a  flat  by  the  local
        authority.
    11. The witness confirms again the appellant will  not  remain  in  the
        United Kingdom after the visit and that he will return  as  he  has
        previously. The appellant says it is now 8 years since she last met
        her husband and that she cannot return to  Bangladesh  due  to  her
        personal circumstances. The appellant states her husband will still
        need to return to look after their children until they are  married
        and that he is still in business in Bangladesh.
    12. There was no cross examination of this witness  who  confirmed  the
        content of the witness statements are true.
    13. A number of  documents  and  other  witness  statements  have  been
        provided in support of  the  application  all  of  which  had  been
        considered.
    14. Whilst the ECO may have had concerns it is clear that the  evidence
        provided in support of earlier applications satisfied  another  ECO
        that the appellant is a genuine visitor to the  United  Kingdom,  a
        fact amply demonstrated by the appellant  returning  to  Bangladesh
        before the expiry of the visit visas in 2007 and 2010.
    15. It was accepted family life recognised by article 8 ECHR exists and
        that refusal interferes with  the  exercise  of  that  family  life
        sufficient to engage article 8.
    16. The proportionality of the decision requires consideration  of  the
        competing  arguments.  The  ECO's  argument  is  that  because  the
        appellant  did  not  provide  sufficient  evidence  to  prove   his
        circumstances are as claimed he will not  return  from  the  United
        Kingdom. The appellants argument is that he has always returned  in
        the past, supported by evidence that he does not wish  to  live  in
        the United Kingdom and strong ties to  Bangladesh  by  way  of  his
        business and daughters who  are  as  yet  unmarried  and  who  will
        require the appellant's presence as their guardian,  in  accordance
        with social  norms,  until  such  time  as  they  are  married  and
        independent.
    17. I am satisfied on the evidence that the respondent  has  failed  to
        discharge the burden of proof to the required standard to establish
        that the interference with family life as a result of this decision
        is proportionate to the legitimate aim relied  upon.  There  is  no
        more than  speculation  that  the  appellant  will  not  return  to
        Bangladesh in the face of evidence clearly supporting his assertion
        that he will.
    18. The sponsor, who attended to give  evidence,  was  advised  at  the
        conclusion of the hearing that as the original decision was made in
        2015 the ECO may wish to interview the appellant or contact him  to
        obtain up to date information to ascertain his circumstances remain
        as they were at that time. This is an option fully open to the  ECO
        and if such a request is made the appellant should cooperate fully,
        including providing  documentation  when  required,  to  avoid  the
        possibility of a further refusal.





Decision

    19. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is allowed  on  human
        rights grounds.


   Anonymity.


    20. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


I make no  such  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
