[Approved ex tempore decision]

                        DETERMINATION AND DIRECTIONS

Appellant:        Mrs J Heybroek (of Counsel), instructed by Khans
Solicitors.
Respondent:   Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.



INTRODUCTION

   1.     This is an appeal by the Appellant, Mr  Muhammad  Shakil,  against
      the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (hereinafter the "FtT")  which
      dismissed his appeal.  He was appealing  against  a  decision  of  the
      Secretary of State whereby his application for permanent residence was
      refused.

   2.   In the grounds of appeal to the FtT it was stated on behalf  of  the
      Appellant that his wife having left him around  July  2012  there  had
      been no subsequent contact between them, with the result that, it  was
      said, it was extremely difficult for him to  demonstrate  evidentially
      that she was working on the important date of 29 April 2013. This  may
      be linked to the summary of the background provided in  paragraphs  10
      and 11  of  the  grounds  of  appeal,  relating  to  evidence  of  the
      Appellant's estranged wife's working activities on certain  dates  and
      between certain periods, together with the direction sought  from  the
      FtT in paragraph 15 of the  grounds  of  appeal.   The  Appellant  was
      putting his case in the alternative.  He was contending that either he
      had demonstrated that the relevant period was proven, or  if  not,  he
      sought a direction from the  Tribunal  that  the  Secretary  of  State
      obtain evidence from the Department of Work and Pensions  and/or  HMRC
      to ascertain whether his wife continues to  work  and  pay  taxes  and
      national insurance contributions in the United Kingdom.

   3.     As the determination  of  the  FtT  demonstrates,  the  Judge  was
      immediately alert to this issue.  It is clear from paragraphs 2 and  3
      that the hearing began with an application on behalf of the  Appellant
      for the making of an appropriate  direction  by  the  Tribunal  and  a
      consequential adjournment.  The Judge records that  the  arguments  on
      behalf of the Appellant, inter alia, relied upon the decision  of  the
      court of appeal in the case of Amos v Secretary of State for the  Home
      Department [2012] EWCA  Civ  55.  The  Judge  specifically  noted  the
      directions sought in paragraph  15  of  the  grounds  of  appeal.   He
      recorded, in passing, that  the  application  for  the  direction  had
      obviously been overlooked in the system.  He  took  into  account  the
      following:

         "I also accept that potentially that there  may  not  have  been  a
         significant delay if the Tribunal had considered the matter  at  an
         earlier stage and had been able to make a direction".


      He then stated that he was refusing the application.

   4.      The  first  reason  for  the  Judge's  refusal  is  difficult  to
      understand.  He said there was a  significant  amount  of  documentary
      evidence that had not been provided and he  elaborated  thereon.  That
      was really nothing to the point  because  the  whole  purpose  of  the
      application for a direction was to fill the evidential void which  the
      Appellant said he was not capable  of  addressing  without  assistance
      from third party agencies.  At the heart of the Judge's  reasoning  is
      the following passage:

         "This is a First-tier Tribunal and despite what the Court of Appeal
         say [the FtT] can only make directions to ensure the smooth running
         and timeliness of the appeal.  It is up to  the  parties  to  bring
         evidence to the Tribunal".


      In thus ruling the Judge did not make any reference of any kind to the
      material provisions of the FtT procedural rules.  These are  contained
      in Rule 45.   While on behalf of the Appellant Mrs  Heybroek  drew  to
      our attention Rule 45 (4)(a), the gravamen of her  argument  was  that
      the operative provision in this context was Rule 45 (d)(iii) and  that
      the Judge had erred in law in  either  disregarding  or  misconstruing
      this Rule.   This  rule  specifically  empowers  the  FtT  to  give  a
      direction requiring a party  "..... to provide further details of  his
      case, or any other information which appears to be necessary  for  the
      determination of the appeal".

   5.     The first error of law that we identify in  the  determination  is
      the Judge's failure to give any consideration whatsoever to  Rule  45.
      That is a rather fundamental error.  The second is that the Judge  has
      in any event misconstrued  the  powers  available  to  the  FtT.   The
      directions which the FtT is empowered to give include  specifically  a
      direction providing for a  party  to  provide  any  information  which
      appears to be necessary for the  determination  of  the  appeal.   The
      criterion governing the exercise of this power was  plainly  satisfied
      in the present case, having regard  to  the  resumï¿½  provided  at  the
      outset of this judgment.   We  consider  the  Judge's  refusal  to  be
      irreconcilable with both the rule and the binding authority of Amos.

   6.   We would add that the rationale of the Rule is clear.   Every  court
      or Tribunal in every litigation context should be as fully informed as
      possible in adjudicating.  Secondly, there is a fair  trial  issue  in
      play:  fairness dictates that where one   party  is  able  to  provide
      material information or documents, such provision should  be  made  in
      fulfilment of the other party's' right  to  a  fair  hearing.   As  Mr
      Jarvis has correctly acknowledged, the issue is here  is  not  whether
      the  Secretary  of  State  could   necessarily   have   provided   the
      information:  the issue, rather, was  whether  a  direction  from  the
      tribunal appeared to be necessary for the determination of the appeal.
        In passing, having regard to the  experience  of  this  Tribunal  it
      seems likely that the Secretary of  State  would  be  able  to  access
      information of this kind.  It is common case,  and  we  take  judicial
      notice of this fact, that such information is routinely  requested  of
      the two agencies concerned and is routinely provided.  That,  however,
      is not to prejudge what might happen in the present case.

Decision

   7.     For the reasons articulated we find that the decision of  the  FtT
      is contaminated by material errors of law. Accordingly  we  set  aside
      the determination.  Since the effect of these errors  was  to  deprive
      the Appellant of a fair hearing at first instance, the correct  course
      is to remit the case to a differently constituted FtT.

           Regulation  6  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
