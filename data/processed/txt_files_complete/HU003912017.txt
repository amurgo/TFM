                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Phull, promulgated on 13th November 2017, following a hearing  at
    Birmingham on 24th October  2017.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Afghanistan, who was born on  [
    ] 1995.  She appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated  7th
    December  2016,  refusing  her  application  to  join  her  husband,  a
    recognised refugee in the United Kingdom by the  name  of  [AY],  under
    paragraph 352A of HC 395.  The decision was upheld upon review  by  the
    Entry Clearance Manager on 5th March 2017.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim was that she was applying under paragraph 352A of
    HC 395 on the basis of the family reunification policies.  This fell to
    be applied to her under the Refugee Convention, as a consequence of her
    husband, [AY], being granted asylum.  Since she was his wife, and could
    still prove, she is entitled also to join him in the UK.

 4. The evidence before the judge on 24th October 2017 from the Sponsor was
    that,

         "The Appellant was part of his family unit because they married  on
         20th April 2010 before he fled Afghanistan.  At the time  his  wife
         was 15 years old.  They  were  married  in  accordance  with  their
         Islamic traditions and tribal culture and relatives on  both  sides
         attended the ceremony.  The marriage was not  registered  with  the
         state at the time" (paragraph 7).

 5. Thereafter, the Sponsor fled Afghanistan and came  to  the  UK  and  he
    applied for asylum, "but he did not disclose on  his  application  form
    that he was married because some friends told him that as his wife  was
    only 15 years old at the date of marriage this would not be  looked  at
    favourably" (paragraph  7).   This  was,  in  fact,  the  crux  of  the
    Appellant's difficulty.

 6. The reason was that thereafter, although the Sponsor was  then  granted
    refugee status (see paragraph  8)  the  lack  of  documentary  evidence
    confirming  that  he  had  indeed  married  his  wife  before  he  fled
    Afghanistan, together with his failure to so disclose,  meant  that  he
    had an additional evidential burden to satisfy.

The Judge's Findings

 7. The judge held that although she had an  Islamic  marriage  certificate
    (pages 175 to 188 of the Appellant's bundle), which did give  the  date
    of marriage as 20th April 2010, it was nevertheless the case  that  the
    marriage certificate "does not give details of where the marriage  took
    place" (paragraph 14).  This was important to the determination of  the
    judge because in her application form, the  Appellant  had  stated  (at
    page 119) that "she has been living  in  Pakistan  as  a  refugee  from
    Afghanistan" and it did appear that  she  had  been  contradicting  her
    evidence of having lived  and  married  in  Afghanistan  in  2010  (see
    paragraph 14).

 8. The judge accordingly concluded that this was not  a  case  of  a  pre-
    flight family reunion application to be determined under paragraph 352A
    of the Immigration Rules.  If the Appellant could not succeed under the
    Immigration Rules  then  the  only  question  was  whether  there  were
    exceptional circumstances outside the Rules, and in this respect, given
    that the Sponsor had been visiting the Appellant in Pakistan, there was
    no reason why this could not continue  in  the  future,  so  that  such
    exceptional circumstances were not proven on the facts of this case.

 9. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that further clarification  could  now
    be provided in terms of where  the  marriage  took  place  because  the
    English translation of  the  original  marriage  certificate  had  been
    incomplete and did not disclose the place of the marriage.

11. On 28th December 2017 permission to appeal was granted,  but  expressly
    on the basis only that, given that the judge had found that the  couple
    were in a genuine and subsisting relationship, the judge ought to  have
    considered whether there were insurmountable obstacles to  family  life
    being conducted elsewhere.  The judge had, he said, concluded that  the
    Appellant can continue visiting the Sponsor in Pakistan  (which  was  a
    safe  third  country)  and  communicating  through  modern   means   of
    communication. Such approach, however, was contrary to the  established
    jurisprudence now  that  certain  relationships  (for  example  between
    husband and wife or between parent and child)  cannot  meaningfully  be
    conducted in this way.

The Hearing

12. At the hearing before me on 2nd March 2018, the Appellant was again not
    legally represented.  Once again he had his brother, [MRY],  who  acted
    as a McKenzie friend.  The Sponsor himself was clearly in  a  state  of
    deep anxiety.  Prior to the hearing  he  had  to  leave  the  courtroom
    because he had just suffered a panic attack.  He had to be attended to,
    both by his relatives who accompanied him, and by the court usher.   He
    was pacified, given a drink, and  allowed  to  retain  some  composure,
    before he re-entered the courtroom to begin the hearing.  It is not  in
    contention that the Sponsor does suffer from  deep  anxiety  and  post-
    traumatic stress disorder because there is  medical  evidence  to  this
    effect.  In the circumstances, he sat next to his brother,  [MRY],  who
    placed reliance upon the grounds of  application  dated  23rd  November
    2017 (which appear in the Respondent's bundle).  On this basis, he made
    the following submissions.

13. First, that the political tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan  now
    means that the majority of refugees  had  been  forcibly  evicted  from
    Pakistan by the government there and that the Appellant and her parents-
    in-law also had to leave Pakistan in this way at the end of 2016.   She
    was  a  non-documented  Afghan  refugee  when  she  returned  back   to
    Afghanistan.  From there she applied for  a  Pakistani  visa  that  was
    valid for three months.  This enabled her to return  back  to  Pakistan
    legally and it was from there that she applied at  the  UK  Embassy  to
    join her sponsoring husband in the UK.  However, once the  three  month
    visa had run out she was then forced to  leave  Pakistan,  was  evicted
    from that country, and is now in Afghanistan, where she has been living
    ever since.

14. Second, that although  the  judge  was  correct  in  stating  that  the
    submitted marriage certificate did not show the place of the  marriage,
    because the translation was a very poor  translation  into  English  so
    that such information was indecipherable, he did now have the  original
    marriage certificate, with a full English  translation.   The  marriage
    certificate confirms the location of the marriage as having taken place
    in Kabul District 5, and this was clear from the stamp, on the original
    marriage certificate.  At the hearing itself, the Sponsor had confirmed
    precisely this, stating that the marriage took place in Puliwali  which
    was the Logar Suburb of Kabul.  Indeed, this location  can  be  clearly
    found on the stamp itself which is put on the  document.   Puliwali  in
    the Logar Province is in the outskirts of Kabul.

15. Third, thereafter the official  marriage  certificate,  issued  by  the
    Afghan Consulate in Pakistan, is dated 18th June 2014,  and  this  also
    contains the relevant details.

16. Fourth, that the Sponsor's wife, [MY], was indeed 15 at the time of the
    marriage, although she might have looked  older  as  a  result  of  her
    having put makeup on her face, but there  was  a  wedding  video  which
    proved that she was actually much younger.

17. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that the rejection of this appeal  was
    inevitable, because the application was made under the  family  reunion
    policy, as enshrined in paragraph 352 of the Immigration Rules, but  at
    the hearing the Appellant failed to satisfy the judge that this  was  a
    pre-flight marriage, because the marriage certificate did not  set  out
    in a legible form the location of the marriage.   That  being  so,  the
    only way that the Appellant could now succeed was under the  principles
    set out by the Supreme Court in Agyarko, but for this she would have to
    show that there were very compelling circumstances.   This  she  cannot
    do.  She may be in an invidious position but she is in no  different  a
    position to many others who cannot comply with  the  Immigration  Rules
    and are forced back onto free-standing Article 8 jurisprudence.

18. In the Appellant's case, however, two options  are  now  open  to  her,
    which are not in many other cases.

   i) First, she had avoided applying under Appendix FM, because she did not
      want to have to show  that  her  husband  was  earning  the  requisite
      �18,600 for a married couple, but this she could now  do  because  her
      husband, the Sponsor, was registered disabled and was  in  receipt  of
      disability allowance, such that he did not have  to  work  because  he
      could not work given his health condition.




  ii) Second, given that the properly translated marriage certificates  were
      now available, which did  show  that  the  location  of  the  marriage
      ceremony was in the Puliwali District of the Logar  Suburb  in  Kabul,
      she could actually make the same application again  under  the  family
      reunion policy as enshrined in paragraph 352 of the Immigration Rules,
      and she had a better chance of success.

Error of Law

19. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

20. First, and most importantly, this is a case where the judge  has  found
    that the Appellant and the Sponsor are  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship.

21. Second, the Sponsor has visited Pakistan a number of  times  (paragraph
    18) where the Appellant was based, and the  judge  accepts  that  "They
    have lived together as husband and wife in Pakistan during  his  visits
    since at least 2013, and they maintain regular contact,  evidence  that
    is not challenged by the Respondent" (paragraph 22).

22. Third, and no less importantly,  it  is  the  case  that  the  Sponsor,
    himself a refugee from Afghanistan, had seen his  wife  the  Appellant,
    [MY], move from Afghanistan  to  Pakistan,  and  then  return  back  to
    Afghanistan when she and her parents-in-law were evicted, being able to
    return only after she had procured a three month visa back to Pakistan,
    and when that had expired, she was forced to leave and return  back  to
    Afghanistan again.  That, indeed, is where she continues  to  currently
    live.

23. Fourth, the prospect that the Sponsor is now evasive, therefore, is  of
    having to exercise his "family  life"  rights  with  the  Appellant  by
    attempting to visit her (not withstanding his worsening ill health such
    that he has now been registered as disabled in the UK) not to Pakistan,
    but to Afghanistan, and that is a country from which, of course, he has
    fled and secured full refugee asylum status in this country.  In short,
    it is not a country to which he can return.

24. It is in these circumstances that the question of "exceptionality"  has
    to be considered.  The definitive authority now is  the  Supreme  Court
    case of Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11, where the court explained that,

         "The Secretary of State has not imposed a test of exceptionality in
         the sense that the case should exhibit some highly unusual feature,
         over and above the application of the test of proportionality.   On
         the contrary, she had defined the word  'exceptional',  as  already
         explained, as meaning circumstances in which refusal  would  result
         in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the  individual  such  that
         the  refusal  of  the  application  would  not  be   proportionate"
         (paragraph 60).

  25. The test accordingly, is whether it would be disproportionate, bearing
      in mind any unjustifiably harsh consequences for the Appellant and his
      wife, to the continuance of family life through,  what  the  judge  in
      this case referred to, as "contact by modern means  of  communication"
      (paragraph 24).


  26. Whilst it may well in any event be argued that such an approach is not
      proportionate in circumstances where a husband  and  wife  have  lived
      together and enjoyed family life together, which would have  been  the
      case when the Appellant and his young wife were living together  as  a
      married couple in Afghanistan shortly after the marriage, and also was
      the case, as the judge found when the  Sponsor  started  visiting  his
      Appellant wife in Pakistan in 2013 (at paragraph 22), the fact is that
      the Sponsor would not even now be able to make the occasional periodic
      visit to see his wife, because she has moved back to Afghanistan, from
      which country the Sponsor had fled as a refugee.


  27. In this respect, Agyarko is once again  helpful  in  setting  out  the
      correct approach:

         "If the applicant or his or her partner would face very significant
         difficulties in continuing their family life together  outside  the
         UK, which could not  be  overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious
         hardship, then the 'insurmountable obstacles' test will be met, and
         leave will be granted under the Rules.  If that test  is  not  met,
         but the refusal of the application would  result  in  unjustifiably
         harsh consequences, such that refusal would not  be  proportionate,
         then leave will be granted outside the  Rules  on  the  basis  that
         there are 'exceptional circumstances'."

  28. This is a case where there are plainly insurmountable obstacles to the
      Sponsor continuing to maintain a family life  with  his  wife  in  any
      meaningful sense, and certainly not in  the  sense  in  which  he  has
      previously enjoyed when he was able  to  live  with  her,  because  he
      cannot return to  Afghanistan  where  she  is  now  based.   Yet,  the
      marriage is a genuine and subsisting one.




  29. What they are  facing  are  "very  significant  difficulties"  in  the
      continuance of their family life.  This poses a very serious  hardship
      for them and I accept that their circumstances in this  situation  are
      "exceptional circumstances" in the sense that there are  unjustifiably
      harsh consequences, with the Appellant having  been  evicted  back  to
      Afghanistan, a country to which the Sponsor cannot return.

Remaking the Decision

30. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before her, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the reasons that I have  set  out
    above.

Notice of Decision

31. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed.

32. No anonymity direction is made.
