Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Solomon
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwncyz


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Chidlebele Kenneth Orji, was born on 28 May 1984 and  is
    a male citizen of Nigeria.  Having entered  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    student, he had applied for further leave to remain on the  basis  that
    he was a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  His application was refused by
    the respondent in  a  decision  dated  5  March  2014.   The  appellant
    appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Robson)  which,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 22 July 2014 dismissed  the  appeal.   The
    appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Judge Robson made a number of findings in the appellant's favour  which
    have not been challenged by the Secretary of State.  In essence,  there
    is one issue remaining  in  this  appeal.   In  order  to  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules, the appellant had to indicate that he had access  to
    �50,000.  The judge found [32] that he had access to  only  �49,250.04.
    The judge did accept that the appellant could take into account in  the
    calculation an account in Nigeria and held in his father's name but was
    for the appellant's benefit.  At [31] the judge stated:

         The skeleton argument [of the appellant] however  has  argued  that
         the First Bank, Nigeria held  funds  of  �49,009.50  [13,050,224.68
         naira] on 27 January [2014] a figure with  which  I  cannot  agree.
         Even a cursory check of a  conversion  rate  at  the  time  of  the
         preparation of this determination shows that the figure is in  fact
         the equivalent as stated above namely �46,700 or thereabouts.

    The question in the appeal (identified by Judge Osborne  when  granting
    permission) was whether the judge was entitled to consider the transfer
    value of the funds as at the date of the hearing before him rather than
    as at the date of application.  I find that the judge erred in  law  by
    considering the conversion rate  at  the  date  that  he  prepared  his
    determination;  the  correct  date  for  carrying  out  the  conversion
    calculation was the date upon which the appellant made his  application
    for further leave to remain.  In consequence, and given that the  judge
    accepted the other calculations and the appellant's ability to meet the
    relevant Immigration Rule,  he  should  have  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal because the appellant had access to more than �50,000 as at  the
    relevant date.

DECISION

 3. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    22 July 2014 is set aside.  I have remade the decision.  This appeal is
    allowed in respect of the Immigration Rules.
