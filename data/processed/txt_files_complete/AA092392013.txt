Representation:

For the Appellant:  no appearance.
For the Respondent: Mrs Pettersen, HOPO


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

   1. This is the appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Robson made following a hearing at Bradford on  the  11
      December 2013 and 14 February 2014, dismissing his appeal against  the
      Respondent's decision of the 17 September 2013 to refuse to grant  him
      asylum.


   2. Mrs Pettersen accepted that the determination could not stand  because
      of a lack of clarity in the findings and, more fundamentally,  because
      the judge had applied the wrong standard of proof when  assessing  the
      evidence. He said that he was applying the civil standard, the balance
      of probabilities, and not the  lower  standard  applicable  in  asylum
      cases.

   3. The decision is set aside.

   4. On Mrs Pettersen's information, the appellant has relocated to London.
      Accordingly the appeal is transferred to Taylor House, to be listed to
      be heard afresh before a judge other than Judge Robson.
