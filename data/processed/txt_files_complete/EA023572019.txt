               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal refusing her an EEA family permit to join her mother,  an
    Italian national, in the United Kingdom pursuant to Regulation 7 of the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.   The  appellant
    is a citizen of Ghana.

Background

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer accepted that the  sponsor  was  exercising
    Treaty rights in the United Kingdom but not that  the  appellant  could
    show adult financial dependency on the sponsor.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer refused entry clearance on the  basis  that
    the appellant, who was over 21,  had  not  demonstrated  that  she  was
    dependent on her mother, the sponsor in the  United  Kingdom,  for  the
    majority of her expenses.  The supporting evidence was considered to be
    inadequate and there was no breakdown  of  her  expenses  and  how  the
    sponsor's funding, when sent, discharged them.

 4. The decision was reviewed by an Entry Clearance Manager who upheld  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision.

First-tier Tribunal decision

 5. The appeal was considered by First-tier Judge Clarke at a hearing on 14
    January 2020.  The respondent did not arrange representation,  but  the
    appellant was represented.

 6. The sponsor gave oral evidence at the hearing.  The  sponsor  said  the
    appellant's father, who still lived in Ghana, had died 5 years ago, but
    no death certificate was produced or other evidence  to  validate  that
    assertion.

 7. The sponsor asserted, again without any  corroborative  evidence,  that
    the appellant's father took no part in her care before  he  died  (when
    she would have been  16  years  old)  and  that  her  own  mother,  the
    appellant's maternal grandmother, had brought her up since the  sponsor
    came to the United Kingdom when the appellant was about 9 or  10  years
    old. There was only recent Western Union evidence of money transfers.

 8. The appellant relied on a  letter  from  the  Gospel  Church  Assembly,
    recording her account to them that she had  not  worked  for  5  years,
    instead completing her nurse's training, and that she was maintained by
    the sponsor.

 9. The Pastor appeared to have no direct knowledge of  these  matters  and
    relied on what the appellant told him.  There was evidence that in  the
    past the sponsor had paid her school fees, but no evidence  as  to  who
    paid for her tertiary education as a nurse.

10. The First-tier Judge did not accept the evidence and was not  satisfied
    that the appellant had demonstrated  dependency  by  providing  cogent,
    reliable, independent evidence.

11. The appeal was dismissed.

Permission to appeal

12. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Judge  O'Brien  on  the
    basis that there was an arguable error of fact at the level of an error
    of law in that the judge ignored  relevant  evidence,  mischaracterised
    evidence, failed to undertake a rounded assessment of the evidence  and
    erred as to the appellant's  place  of  residence.   Specifically,  the
    judge appeared to suggest at [14] that it  was  for  the  appellant  to
    prove that she was not in employment.

Rule 24 Reply

13. There was no Rule 24 reply.

Further directions

14. On 23 June 2020, the Upper Tribunal sent out triage directions made  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley in the light of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.
    The appellant was invited, if so advised, to submit further submissions
    on the error of law issue, with a right for the respondent to reply, if
    triage submissions were made, and a further  right  of  reply  for  the
    appellant thereafter.

15. Both parties were directed  to  say  whether  they  considered  that  a
    further hearing, oral or remote, was required.  In default, the  appeal
    would be considered on the papers and triage submissions, if any.

Submissions received

16. Triage submissions were received  from  the  appellant.  The  appellant
    incorporated  her  grounds  of  appeal  by  reference  in  the   triage
    submissions, and emphasised that points on which the  judge  wished  to
    rely should  have  been  put  to  the  appellant's  witness  in  cross-
    examination.  No particular  point  is  specified:  the  allegation  is
    generic.

17. The appellant further submitted that more weight should have been given
    to her pastor's letter, since he was a person in authority.  She argued
    that 'there was certainly no reasons to discredit or undermine it'.

18. In relation to dependence,  the  appellant  argued  that  'a  fair  and
    reasonable approach, which was omitted by the Immigration Judge, should
    have been to make that historic support/dependence a starting point, by
    acknowledging  its  obvious  reasonable  weight   of   congruence   and
    consistency with the appellant's claim'.

19. The respondent did not reply.

20. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Analysis

21. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make a decision on whether the
    First-tier Tribunal decision contains a material error of  law  on  the
    basis of the decisions and submissions before me.   The  appellant  has
    raised no objection and the respondent continues to show no interest in
    taking part in these proceedings.

22. The grounds of appeal are really no more than a disagreement  with  the
    findings of fact and credibility by the First-tier Judge.  In  relation
    to the evidence of the sponsor, her mother, the First-tier Judge is the
    fact-finder and the appellant has not identified any point relied  upon
    which was not put to the sponsor in evidence.

23.  As  regards  the  pastor's  letter,  I  have  examined  it  with  some
    difficulty.  It is barely legible on the copy in the Tribunal file.  It
    appears not to have been written for these  proceedings  but  to  be  a
    reference for possible employment.   The  letter  is  dated  13  or  18
    February 2019 (it is not quite clear which): I cite it in full:

         "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

         I am Rev. Samuel Opoku Marfo the head  pastor  of  the  above-named
         church.  Cynthia Hayford has been a member of  this  church  for  5
         years and she is in  good  standing.   I  know  she  has  completed
         nursing training  but  is  unemployed.   Her  mother,  Mrs  Comfort
         Konadu, has been taking care of  her  financial  needs  before  and
         after her completion of school.  Throughout this period,  she  does
         voluntary work in the  church  without  any  payment.   Cynthia  is
         trustworthy, hardworking and intelligent.

         I recommend her for any  opportunity  she  desires  to  apply  for.
         Kindly extend to her any assistance she may be in need  of.   Thank
         you."

24. The undertaking of voluntary  work  at  a  church  is  not  necessarily
    incompatible with nursing training, or employment. The First-tier Judge
    did not err in treating that letter as a generous one,  but  one  which
    was basically just a reflection of what  the  appellant  had  told  the
    pastor.  I do not find  that  it  was  given  inappropriate  weight  or
    respect.

25. There is also a character reference from the appellant's  head  teacher
    at the Army Basic School in Kumasa, Ghana confirming  that  her  mother
    paid the school fees from 2003-2005.  The judge accepted  that.   There
    is another letter from the  headmistress  of  Afua  Kobi  Ampem  Girls'
    Senior High School stating that the sponsor was the sole  financier  of
    the appellant's studies there from 2005/2006.  Again, this was accepted
    in the judge's decision.

26. There is a certificate  that  the  appellant  is  a  'Registered  Nurse
    Assistant Preventive' dated 28 March 2018, but no evidence  as  to  who
    paid for that training, which appears to fall short of a  full  nursing
    qualification.

27. As regards  the  Western  Union  evidence,  the  sponsor  has  produced
    receipts for a number of transfers dated 29 December 2018,  24  January
    2019, 18 May 2019, 17 June 2019, 18 September 2019,  and  19  September
    2019.  The payments range between �50 and �149.60.

28. The application for a Regulation 7 family permit was made  on  1  March
    2019, so it is right to say that two of  these  payments  predated  the
    application.   However,  they  are  not  listed  among  the   documents
    submitted with the application.  Absent any  indication  how  much  the
    appellant's study and living costs were,  the  judge  was  entitled  to
    conclude that she was not satisfied that the appellant was  financially
    dependent on the sponsor at the date of application, which  is  a  pre-
    condition for an EEA family permit for an adult child.

29. There is no material error of fact or law in the decision of the First-
    tier Judge.

30. This appeal is dismissed.



DECISION

31. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law

    I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
