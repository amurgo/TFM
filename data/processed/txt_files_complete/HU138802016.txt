                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, who is a foreign criminal  against  whom  a  deportation
    order has been made,  appeals  from  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge S. Meah sitting at Taylor House  on  31  January  2017)
    dismissing his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State to
    refuse his claim that his removal pursuant  to  the  deportation  order
    would constitute a disproportionate  interference  with  the  right  to
    respect for his family and private life enshrined in Article 8 ECHR.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 5 July 2017, Judge  Shimmin  granted  the  appellant  permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons:

      i) it is arguable that the Judge materially erred in the assessment of
         the weight to be attached to the appellant's presence in the United
         Kingdom since 1976;

     ii) it is arguable that the Judge's  findings  are  at  odds  with  the
         guidance of the Upper Tribunal  in  Treebhowan  [2017]  UKUT  00103
         (IAC);

    iii) it is arguable that  the  Judge  erred  in  his  consideration  and
         treatment of the expert's report.

Relevant Background Facts

 3. The appellant is a national of Malaysia, whose  date  of  birth  is  10
    January 1957.  He entered the United Kingdom on 3 September 1976  as  a
    student, and was granted 12 months' leave  to  enter.   His  leave  was
    extended to 3 September  1978,  and  he  was  then  granted  a  further
    extension of leave to remain from 19 July 1979 to 30 September 1979.

 4. On 19 February 1993, the appellant  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the UK on  compassionate  grounds  outside  the  Rules.   The
    application was refused on 2 June 1994, with no right of appeal.  In  a
    notice of refusal, the appellant was informed that he should leave  the
    UK without delay.  If he failed to leave, he might be prosecuted for an
    offence under the Immigration Acts, and he  would  also  be  liable  to
    deportation.

 5. On 9 December 2011, the appellant  was  convicted  at  Guildford  Crown
    Court on 20 counts of making indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs
    of children, and five counts of possessing an  indecent  photograph  or
    pseudo-photograph of a child.  On 2 February 2012 he was  sentenced  to
    13 months' imprisonment.  Following his conviction, he was notified  on
    9 March 2012 of his liability to automatic deportation.  On 16  October
    2014, the appellant was convicted at  South  West  Surrey  Magistrates'
    Court of the following three offences: (1) breach of a Sexual Offenders
    Prevention Order, for which he was fined �100, and  ordered  to  pay  a
    victim's surcharge of �20; (2) a Failure to  Comply  with  Notification
    Requirements, for which he was fined �50; and (3) a further breach of a
    Sexual Offenders Prevention Order, for which  he  was  fined  �100  and
    given a "deprivation" sanction.

 6. On 26 May 2016, the respondent made a  deportation  order  against  the
    appellant under section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.  On the  same
    day, the respondent issued a decision to refuse the  appellant's  human
    rights claim, on the ground that Exception 1 in Section 33 of the  2007
    Act did not apply.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7.  At  the  hearing  before  Judge  Meah,  both  parties   were   legally
    represented.  The Judge received oral evidence from the  appellant  and
    his British national spouse, Mrs J P.  On the topic of the risk of  re-
    offending,  the  Judge  considered  inter  alia   a   letter   from   a
    psychologist, a report from a psychiatrist, and the pre-sentence report
    dated 18 January 2012.  The Judge found  at  paragraph  [52]  that  the
    appellant still posed a risk to children.

Finding on whether removal would have unduly harsh impact on spouse

 8. The Judge found at paragraph [55] that Mrs  P  was  a  fully  qualified
    Chartered Accountant whose qualification was  recognised  in  Malaysia,
    and that even if she could not find employment in Malaysia akin to  the
    level she was working at in the UK, "other alternative employment  will
    be a realistic option, and poignantly, this is  by  no  means  a  valid
    reason for her not being to go and live there with the  appellant  when
    considered in the context of the relevant law and provisions applicable
    here".

Other relevant findings

 9. The Judge found at paragraph [73] that, with his skills, and  with  his
    educational and employment background, the appellant should be able  to
    transition into life in Malaysia and gain employment there, even if  he
    might experience some initial difficulties when he first arrived.

10. The Judge found at paragraph [74] that the appellant's status in the UK
    had been precarious for the best part of  almost  39  years,  while  he
    knowingly remained here illegally as an overstayer  after  his  student
    leave expired in  1979,  and  without  him  taking  any  proper  active
    measures to resolve this.

11. The Judge found at paragraph [74] that the appellant had been convicted
    of "a very serious and abhorrent" criminal offence.

The Judge's Conclusions

12. The Judge reached the following conclusions:

         76.  Having considered all the relevant evidence presented to me in
             the round, including the remarks of the  Sentencing  Judge  in
             the appellant's criminal trial, I find  that  the  appellant's
             criminal history is  a  serious  matter  which  outweighs  the
             factors advanced on his behalf in relation to  his  Article  8
             claim, and in particular the presence of his British wife with
             whom he lives in the UK.

         77.  I find that his Article 8 rights are insufficient to  outweigh
             the very strong public interest in favour of  his  deportation
             to Malaysia.

         78.      Finally, I do not find  that  there  is  anything  in  the
             appellant's  circumstances  which   can   be   deemed   either
             exceptional or very compelling to go against  the  presumption
             in favour of maintaining the decision to deport him.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

13. At the hearing before us to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Talacchi developed the grounds of appeal  referred  to  by  the
    Judge granting permission to appeal.  On behalf of the  respondent,  Mr
    Melvin adhered to the Rule 24 response settled by a colleague  opposing
    the appeal.  He submitted that Treebhowan was irrelevant, as it was not
    a deportation case.

Discussion

14. The appellant meets the  definition  of  a  foreign  criminal  for  the
    purposes of Section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 ("the 2002 Act") as he was sentenced to a period  of  imprisonment
    of at least 12 months. Section 117C sets out additional public interest
    considerations   in   cases   involving   foreign   criminals.    These
    considerations are:

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
             interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
             the greater is the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  the
             criminal.

         (3)  In the case of  a  foreign  criminal  (C)  who  has  not  been
             sentenced to a period  of  four  years  or  more,  the  public
             interest  requires  C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
             Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where -

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
                  most of C's life; and

              (b) C is socially and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom; and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to  be
                  deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.


         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
             period of imprisonment of at  least  four  years,  the  public
             interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2.

Ground 1

15. Ground 1 is that the Judge materially erred in the  assessment  of  the
    weight to be attached the appellant's long-standing presence in the UK.
    It is argued that the Judge's finding at paragraph [53] is at odds with
    the guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in Treebhowan [2017] UKUT 0013
    (IAC); and  that  he  has  not  engaged  lawfully  with  the  ratio  of
    Treebhowan, which is that  a  private  life  developed  or  established
    during periods of unlawful or precarious  residence  might  conceivably
    qualify to be accorded more than little weight,  and  Sections  117B(4)
    and (5) of the 2002 Act are to be construed and applied accordingly.

16. We consider that due  emphasis  must  be  given  to  the  words  "might
    conceivably".  It all depends upon the factual  matrix.   Although  not
    cited to us, we have had regard to Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 in which Lord
    Reed at paragraphs [49]-[53] emphasised a passage in the IDIs  that  it
    is people who put down roots in the UK  "in  the  full  knowledge  that
    their stay here is unlawful or precarious" who  should  be  given  less
    weight in the Article 8 balance.

17. Lord Reed could envisage circumstances in which "people might be  under
    reasonable misapprehension as to their ability  to  maintain  a  family
    life in the UK, and in which a less stringent approach might  therefore
    be appropriate".  However, this appellant and his spouse were not under
    a reasonable misapprehension as to their ability to maintain  a  family
    life in the UK, as it was not  disputed  that  their  relationship  was
    entered into and maintained in the full knowledge  that  the  appellant
    was present in the UK unlawfully.

18. We have also had regard to Ruppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803, where Sales  LJ
    held: "for a case falling within section 117B(5) little  weight  should
    be given to private life established in  the  circumstances  specified,
    but that approach may be overridden where the private life in  question
    has a special and compelling character."

19. Were it not for the appellant's criminal conviction in  2011,  arguably
    his  private  life  would  have  acquired  a  special  and   compelling
    character, having regard to his length of  residence  in  the  UK,  his
    record of employment, and the ties  which  he  had  formed  here,  most
    notably with his British national spouse.

20. However, as the appellant is  a  foreign  criminal  who  is  liable  to
    deportation, his private life claim also had  to  be  assessed  against
    section 117C(4) of the 2002 Act with a  view  to  establishing  whether
    Exception  1  applied.  Exception  1  clearly  did  not  apply  to  the
    appellant.  He had not been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his
    life, and Judge Meah found that there would  not  be  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant's integration into the country of return, as
    we have noted at paragraph [9] above.

21.  At  paragraph  [53]  of  his  decision,  Judge  Meah  found  that  the
    appellant's long-standing presence in the UK since 1976 was "of  little
    consequence when considered  in  the  proportionality  assessment".  We
    consider that this finding in a deportation case was  clearly  open  to
    the Judge for the reasons which he gave, and that  it  is  entirely  in
    line with the relevant statutory provisions and the  relevant  domestic
    jurisprudence governing foreign criminals who come within the scope  of
    Section 117C of the 2002 Act. The Judge did  not  err  in  law  in  not
    attaching greater weight  in  the  proportionality  assessment  to  the
    appellant's long-standing presence in the UK since 1976.



Ground 2

22. When interviewed by an Immigration Officer  on  17  January  1993,  the
    appellant said that his parents were in Malaysia, although he  was  not
    in touch with them.  He said that he had  lost  contact  with  his  two
    brothers, whose whereabouts he did not know, and he  thought  that  his
    sister was in New Zealand.

23. On 26 September 2016, the appellant was seen by Doctor Balasubramaniam,
    a Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, in his Consulting  Room
    in London.  The appellant told him that he was an  orphan  and  he  had
    been brought up in an orphanage.  He  said  that  he  was  bullied  and
    sexually abused by staff  and  older  boys  while  growing  up  in  the
    orphanage.

24. In his report dated 27 September 2016, Doctor Balasubramaniam diagnosed
    the appellant as suffering from a depressive disorder.  On the topic of
    treatment (page 6) he said that he had been treated with  psychological
    therapies and  it  had  improved.   He  had  re-started  his  treatment
    privately with his therapist.  In addition, he was  likely  to  benefit
    from anti-depressant treatment.  He should be able to  obtain  it  from
    his GP: "His depression is brought about  by  the  sexual  abuse  as  a
    child, loss of employment, loss of prestige since his  conviction,  and
    the pending deportation order."

25. At paragraph [27] of his decision,  the  Judge  noted  the  appellant's
    evidence in his witness statement and in answer to questions in  cross-
    examination that he was sexually abused as a child whilst growing up in
    an orphanage  in  Malaysia,  "with  the  inference  that  this  somehow
    explained his offending behaviour  and  paedophilic  tendencies  as  an
    adult and the specific crimes of which he was convicted."

26. The Judge went on to give extensive  reasons  as  to  why  he  was  not
    prepared to accept that the appellant  had  suffered  childhood  sexual
    abuse, as he claimed, and that it had in all probability, "been created
    to support the appellant's case  against  deportation".   At  paragraph
    [40], he found that the false claim firmed up his conclusion  that  the
    appellant still posed a very serious and extant threat to  children  in
    the UK, notwithstanding his efforts to minimise this criminal behaviour
    through the therapy sessions  which  he  said  he  was  undertaking  at
    present.

27. In Ground 2, it is pleaded that the Judge devoted a substantial part of
    his findings  (paragraphs  26-40  of  his  decision)  to  assessing  an
    argument that was not actually pursued by the appellant.   Accordingly,
    the Judge had unlawfully taken into account an irrelevant  matter;  and
    his error was material to the outcome, as he had  treated  the  "false"
    claim as significantly damaging the  appellant's  overall  credibility,
    including the credibility of his account of the  Malaysian  authorities
    refusing to acknowledge  that  he  was  a  Malaysian  citizen  who  was
    entitled to enter Malaysia.

28. We consider that it was open to the Judge to find  that  the  claim  of
    sexual abuse in an orphanage during childhood was not credible, for the
    reasons which he gave.   We  do  not  consider  that  the  finding  was
    irrelevant to the issues which the Judge had to decide.

29. Firstly, the finding was  relevant  to  the  question  of  whether  the
    appellant was credible in his claim that he had fully  cooperated  with
    the Malaysian authorities in providing accurate information  about  his
    life in Malaysia before he came here as a student.

30. Secondly, the finding was relevant  to  the  question  of  whether  the
    information which he had provided to the psychiatrist was truthful.  If
    it was untrue, as the Judge found, it provided an  evidential  platform
    for the finding at paragraph [51] that critical  parts  of  the  report
    were essentially a regurgitation of what the appellant told the author,
    and hence "highly subjective", as  distinct  from  the  critical  parts
    being based on truthful and reliable information.

31. We also consider that it was open to the Judge to treat the false claim
    as  firming  up  his  conclusion  that  the  appellant  still  posed  a
    significant risk to children, rather than accepting the opinion of  the
    psychiatrist that he now posed only a very  low  risk  because  he  had
    completed two years of psychological treatment "with good effect"  (the
    sixth factor)  and  he  had  a  "high  motivation  to  change  his  old
    behaviour" (the seventh factor).  For we  note  that  the  causal  link
    between his criminal offending and alleged past trauma  was  explicitly
    made by Elisabeth Batty, Senior Counselling Psychologist, in her letter
    of 27 January 2017.  Ms Batty had undertaken therapy sessions with  the
    appellant for two years since April 2013. She said: "He has  been  able
    to reflect more on the connection of his  past  abusive  and  traumatic
    history and his previous conviction to try to understand what  led  him
    to collect the images." If the appellant had  invented  an  account  of
    being abused as a child  in  an  orphanage  in  order  to  explain  the
    motivation for  his  criminal  offending,  as  the  Judge  found,  this
    supported the Judge's finding at paragraphs [34]-[40] that "due weight"
    should be given to the assessment in the pre-sentence report  that  the
    appellant posed a high risk of harm to children, because,  among  other
    reasons, "Mr Param had limited insight  into  the  motivation  for  his
    criminal offending or the impact of it".

Ground 3

32. Ground 3 is that, at paragraphs [51]-[52], the Judge unlawfully  failed
    to  consider  the  list  of  "good  prognostic   factors"   which   the
    psychiatrist had given in his report as  being  likely  to  reduce  the
    appellant's potential risk to children in the future.

33. Mr Talacchi  developed  the  argument  in  his  oral  submissions.   He
    submitted that the Judge's assessment of the psychiatrist's conclusions
    was unbalanced.  The Judge had seized  upon  the  one  negative  factor
    identified by the psychiatrist, which was that in one of the papers  it
    had been quoted that the incidence of sexual offending behaviour was 12
    times higher in people who collect sexual images of  children  compared
    to the general population.  The Judge had failed to go on to  refer  to
    the good prognostic factors that reduced the risk.

34. We note that five of the seven "good prognostic factors" identified  by
    the psychiatrist also applied before the appellant committed the  index
    criminal  offences  which  triggered   his   liability   to   automatic
    deportation.  Nevertheless, these five  factors  did  not  prevent  the
    appellant from offending. So we do not consider that the Judge erred in
    law in not commenting on them specifically.

35. On analysis, the sixth and seventh factors  previously  discussed  were
    the  factors  which  principally  underpinned  the  conclusion  of  the
    psychiatrist that the appellant  now  presented  a  very  low  risk  to
    children. We find that the Judge gave adequate reasons in the course of
    his decision as to  why,  by  direct  or  oblique  reference  to  these
    factors, he did not agree with this assessment.

36. At paragraph [51], the Judge acknowledged that the  psychiatric  report
    was supportive of the appellant's case against deportation. It was open
    to the Judge not to give the report decisive  weight  for  the  reasons
    which he gave, which included the following: (a) that  the  report  was
    prepared following a one-off meeting; (b) that the earlier 2015  report
    from the  psychologist  had  not  been  disclosed;  and  (c)  that  the
    appellant had not told the truth about  suffering  sexual  abuse  as  a
    child.

37. At paragraph [52], the Judge went on to say that, in any event, even if
    he were to accept the report and its  conclusions  at  face  value,  he
    still did not find its contents were sufficient, when viewed  in  light
    of all the other evidence  placed  before  him,  to  rebut  the  strong
    presumption in favour of deportation. This was  clearly  a  sustainable
    finding, having regard to the fact that future risk is only  one  facet
    of the public interest in the deportation of  foreign  criminals.   The
    other facets are deterrence and the building of  public  confidence  in
    the system for  dealing  with  foreign  criminals  who  have  committed
    serious crimes.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

We make no anonymity direction.
