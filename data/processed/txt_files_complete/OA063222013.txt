For the Appellant: Mr E Fripp (Counsel, instructed by Kinas Solicitors)
For the Respondent: Mr A Armstrong (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant applied for entry clearance to the UK as a spouse on the
    10th of November 2012. The application was refused by the ECO for the
    reasons given in the Refusal Notice of the 4th of February 2013, the
    reasons included a failure by the Appellant to provide the specified
    documents in support of the Sponsor's claimed income. The Appellant
    appealed.

 2. The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Malone on the 24th of
    March 2014 at Taylor House. Having heard from the Sponsor the appeal
    was allowed under the Immigration Rules as the Judge found that the
    Sponsor met the earnings requirement and that the failure to provide
    the specified evidence was de minimis. The appeal was also allowed
    under article 8.

 3. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal in grounds dated the
    30th of April 2014. The grounds proceed on the basis that the Sponsor
    was not exempt from the financial requirements and it had been conceded
    at the hearing the Sponsor did not meet the requirements of appendix FM-
    SE, in the period before the application his income was insufficient.

 4. In addition not all the specified documents had been provided and the
    Tribunal had not had regard to the relevant date, the date of the
    application. It was also submitted that the approach taken to article 8
    was flawed. There were no exceptional circumstances and family life
    could be continued in Turkey.

 5. Permission was initially refused but the application was renewed and
    permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor on the 7th of
    October 2014. He indicated that it was arguable that the Tribunal erred
    in paragraph 24 in disregarding the financial requirements in Appendix
    FM-SE as de minimis. It was also arguable that the decision under
    article 8 was flawed in failing to take account of the public interest
    in not allowing entry to those who do not meet the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules.

 6. At the hearing Mr Fripp accepted that the Appellant failed under the
    Immigration Rules and he was clearly right to do so. The Judge appears
    to have overlooked the 2 stage process involved in assessing whether
    the maintenance requirements are met. The first is whether the required
    specified documents have been supplied, if not that is the end of the
    matter, and then to assess whether, at the date of the application, the
    Sponsor's earnings discharged the requirements of the rules.

 7. The appeal could not succeed under the Immigration Rules and the Judge
    clearly erred in allowing it on that basis. The Judge was obliged to
    consider whether the specified evidence had been provided, it had not,
    and had to find whether on the basis of evidence admissible under the
    Immigration Rules whether the Sponsor's earnings exceeded ï¿½18,6000 at
    the date of the application. In the absence of the required evidence
    that finding could not be made. The finding in paragraph 24 was an
    error as the Judge considered the finances at the date of the decision
    and not that of the application and on the basis of inadmissible
    evidence.

 8. Ordinarily in out of country appeals the facts are to be assessed at
    the date of the decision under appeal and that applies to
    considerations under article 8 as well as the rules, As (Somalia)
    [2009] UKHL 32. In this case the relevant date was the date of the
    application for consideration under the Immigration Rules and the date
    of the decision for the application of article 8. In any event the
    submission of post decision evidence would be subject to the provisions
    of section 85 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and
    DR (Morocco).

 9. In considering the position under article 8 the Judge set out his
    considerations at paragraph 27. These too disclose clear errors. The
    relevant date was that of the decision, the 4th of February 2013. I am
    not unsympathetic to the Appellant's and Sponsor's loss of their twins
    but this was legally irrelevant, I am told that they died on the 4th of
    January 2014. The Appellant might have been pregnant at the date of the
    decision but this was not in evidence, and so subsequent events,
    however heartbreaking, could not be said to appertain to the date of
    the decision.

10. It was not open to the Judge to find that the Appellant and Sponsor
    were being kept apart by the unlawful decision of the ECO, for the
    reasons given above that was wrong. The decision under the Immigration
    Rules was the only one open to the ECO and at the date of the decision
    the later events that moved the Judge could not have been in
    contemplation and should have not informed the decision.

11. The Appellant and Sponsor could live together in Turkey, it is their
    choice that they would prefer to live in the UK. There was nothing in
    the circumstances of the Appellant and Sponsor at the date of the
    decision that would have justified considering the case outside the
    Immigration Rules under article 8 and still less to justify allowing
    the appeal under that heading.

12. In summary the determination of Judge Malone contained a number of
    errors of law in relation to the Immigration Rules and article 8. The
    decision is flawed for the reasons given and cannot be sustained. I
    have considered the Appellant's case and having set aside the
    determination I remake the decision and am obliged to dismiss the
    appeal.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal dismissing the appeal of Dilber
Yilmaz.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

Fee Award

In dismissing the appeal I make no fee award.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
