For the Appellant:           Mr R Gibb, Immigration Advisory Service,
Glasgow
For the Respondent:          Mr P. Laverty, Home Office Presenting Officer.

The terms of the guidance applicable to points-based scheme applications
make it clear that the documents accompanying the application must show the
required sums as credit balances.  If the sums are sufficient, it does not
appear to matter that they have been lent to the applicant.  But it is not
sufficient to show merely that a loan has been arranged.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.        The Appellant, a national of Nigeria,  appealed  to  the  Tribunal
      against the decision of the respondent on 21 March 2009  refusing  him
      leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1  (Post  Study  Work)
      Migrant.  An immigration judge dismissed his  appeal.   The  appellant
      sought and obtained an order for  reconsideration.   Thus  the  matter
      comes before us.

2.    A number of matters were raised  before  the  Immigration  Judge,  who
      decided,  amongst  other  things,  clearly  correctly,  that   because
      paragraph 245AA of the Statement of Changes in  Immigration  Rules  HC
      395 incorporates the guidance there specified, in order to comply with
      the immigration rules an applicant must comply with the guidance.  The
      issue in this case relates to the amount of  money  available  to  the
      appellant with which to satisfy the maintenance  requirements  of  the
      points based scheme.  The  relevant  requirement  in  the  appellant's
      case, and the appellant's  attempt  to  satisfy  that  requirement  is
      clearly  and  succinctly  set   out   in   Mr   Gibb's   grounds   for
      reconsideration at para 7 and 8 as follows:-

      "  7. That as the petitioner's application was made before 31  October
           2008 the respondent's policy states that he must have  had  �800
           available to him at the time of his application.  It also stated
           that the documents produced  to  evidence  the  availability  of
           these funds must be dated no earlier than  a  month  before  his
           application. ....

        8.    That the appellant submitted bank statements in  the  required
           form and dated within the specified period  in  support  of  his
           application.  The balance in his account  was  less  than  �800.
           Nevertheless, he had  an  overdraft  facility  available,  which
           allowed him to withdraw an additional  �800  if  required.   His
           overdraft limit was �2,750 as confirmed by  a  letter  from  his
           Bank [submitted to the respondent].   Following  the  28  August
           2008 (i.e. within one month  of  his  application)  his  balance
           never fell below minus �1,999.82."

   3.   The grounds were supported by an elegant and comprehensive  argument
       referring to the terms of the current guidance, which make  reference
       to the possibility of satisfying the maintenance requirement by means
       of a loan, and on the meaning of the  word  "loan"  in  general.   Mr
       Gibb's submission was that a person may meet the requirements of  the
       rules if he cannot show possession of the required sum of  money,  by
       showing instead an agreement under which he  can  draw  that  sum  of
       money from a lender.

   4. We are unable to accept that submission.  The reference  to  loans  in
       the guidance is, as Mr Gibb recognised, a  new  feature  of  guidance
       which came into operation after the  date  of  the  decision  against
       which the appellant appeals.  That guidance makes clear on  its  face
       that it applies to "applications made on or  after  31  March  2009."
       The feature of the guidance upon which Mr Gibb sought to rely  is  of
       particular importance in the present case not merely  because  it  is
       not the guidance applicable to the application (and the rules require
       an application to meet the terms of the guidance in operation at  the
       date of the application); but also because the applicant  claims  the
       benefit of a specific provision applicable under predecessor guidance
       only to applications  made  before  31  October  2008.   In  general,
       because of the terms of the rules, an appellant needs to show that he
       met the requirements  of  the  guidance  at  the  time  he  made  his
       application; but, specifically in the present case, an  appellant  is
       clearly not entitled to select the parts which favour  him  from  two
       different editions of the guidance which cannot both apply to him.

   5. In any event, the  most  recent  version  of  the  guidance,  although
       referring  to  loans,  shares  another  feature  with  all   previous
       editions.  That is that the evidence of maintenance can  be  provided
       in any one of four ways, but that in each case the evidence must show
       that the sum of money has actually  been  credited  to  the  relevant
       account.  The words used in relation  to  bank  statements  are  "the
       balance must always be at least  �2,800  or  �800,  as  appropriate."
       That provision is a  simple  and  readily  intelligible  requirement.
       Documents which fail to show a balance at the required  level  simply
       are not evidence of the requirements of the points based scheme.

   6. Mr Gibb told us that  he  had  received  an  e-mail  from  the  United
       Kingdom's Border Agency in response  to  a  query  about  when  loans
       became admissible, given that they are mentioned for the  first  time
       in the most recent guidance.  He received the answer that  they  have
       always been admissible.  That may well be so.  If the money is in the
       account, the respondent does not require an applicant to  demonstrate
       that the money is his, rather than merely having been  lent  to  him.
       Thus the evidence may be evidence of  a  loan  that  has  been  made.
       Nothing in any document we have seen shows that a person can meet the
       maintenance requirements by showing that there is an agreement for  a
       loan, or in any other way that does not include showing the  relevant
       sum as a credit balance in the account.

   7. For the foregoing reasons, it appears to us that the Immigration Judge
       was entirely correct to dismiss the appeal.  He made no error of  law
       and we order that his determination shall stand.
