                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Maryam Sasanipour, date of birth 20.10.88, is a  citizen
    of Iran.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Black promulgated  12.12.14,  dismissing  on  all  grounds  her  appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  19.9.14,  to
    refuse her asylum, humanitarian protection  and  human  rights  claims.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 12.12.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Murray  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    5.2.15.  However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  McGinty  granted  permission  on
    13.5.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 15.9.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I find no material error of law in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the determination of Judge Black to be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can be summarised  as  follows.  The  appellant
    first came to the UK in 2009 on a visit visa.  She  claimed  asylum  on
    grounds that she feared she would be killed by her family on return  to
    Iran, on account of having been filmed whilst engaging in  sexual  acts
    with two men. Her claim was  rejected  and  she  became  appeal  rights
    exhausted  by  April  2010.   In   June   2010   she   lodged   further
    representations, now alleging to be a  Christian  convert  from  Islam.
    That claim was also rejected. Further submissions on the  same  grounds
    were also rejected in 2011 and she was returned  to  Iran  on  12.5.11,
    accompanied by medical escorts. However,  in  July  2012  she  returned
    illegally to the UK and claimed asylum  on  arrival  on  27.7.12.  This
    further claim for asylum alleged that she  feared  being  arrested  and
    mistreated by the Iranian authorities on account of being  a  suspected
    spy. She also claimed that whilst  in  Iran  she  started  a  web  blog
    detailing the ill-treatment of her by the Iranian authorities  and  the
    general prevalence in Iran of violence towards women. She claimed  that
    since arriving in the UK she had posted some 16 or 17 further web  blog
    entries critical of the Iranian regime.

 7. Relying on the Devaseelan principle, Judge Black took as  the  starting
    point the decision of Immigration Judge Birkby promulgated 26.1.10,  in
    which the appellant's claim to have  been  filmed  whilst  engaging  in
    sexual acts with two men was found not credible and  her  evidence  was
    described as vague, implausible, inconsistent and  evasive.  The  judge
    did not accept that there was any such video,  or  that  she  had  been
    threatened or blackmailed, or assaulted or raped, or attempted suicide,
    as claimed by the appellant. No new evidence was adduced  before  Judge
    Black as to these earlier asylum claims.

 8. Judge Black also found the appellant  not  credible  and  rejected  her
    account of being suspected of acting as a spy, and that her family  had
    been approached  by  the  authorities.  The  judge  accepted  the  COIR
    evidence that the Iranian authorities prosecuted and punished  bloggers
    expressing dissenting views and have cracked down on  online  activism.
    However, the judge concluded that there was nothing  to  indicate  that
    the appellant would be perceived as an activist so as  to  attract  the
    adverse attention of the authorities. In  fact,  the  judge  found  the
    evidence of blogging activities to be vague and lacking in credibility.
    Overall,  taking  the  evidence  as  a  whole,  the  judge  found   the
    appellant's account not credible and thus dismissed the appeal.

 9. The main complaints in the grounds of  application  for  permission  to
    appeal are that: the First-tier Tribunal Judge erroneously assessed the
    risk to the appellant from the Iranian authorities as a result  of  her
    blogging activities; wrong required corroboration in  respect  thereof;
    and failed to adequately deal with her sur place claim, also  based  on
    alleged continuation of the blogging activities. In granting permission
    to appeal, Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McGinty  found  these  issues
    arguably amounted to material errors of law.

10. In relation to corroboration, I do not accept Mr Bonavero's reading  of
    the  decision  to  the  effect  that  the   judge   improperly   sought
    corroboration. In ST (Corroboration -  Kasolo)  Ethiopia  [2004]  UKIAT
    00119 the Tribunal said that  it  was  a  misdirection  to  imply  that
    corroboration  was  necessary  for  a  positive  credibility   finding.
    However, the fact that corroboration was not required did not mean that
    an Adjudicator was required to leave out  of  account  the  absence  of
    documentary  evidence,  which  could   reasonably   be   expected.   In
    particular, the Adjudicator was entitled to comment that it  would  not
    have been difficult for the Appellant to provide  a  death  certificate
    concerning his brother or some evidence to support his contention  that
    he had received hospital treatment. These were issues of fact  for  the
    Adjudicator to assess. In Gedow, Abdulkadir and Mohammed v SSHD  [2006]
    EWCA 1342 the judge had noted that the Somali appellant claimed that an
    uncle had funded his journey and the referred to "the  absence  of  any
    corroborative evidence by letter or any other means from  his  paternal
    uncle."  The judge was attacked on  appeal  for  erroneously  requiring
    corroboration, but the Court of Appeal said that he  was  not;  he  was
    merely drawing a conclusion from the absence of corroboration;  and  he
    was entitled to do so, so long as he  bore  in  mind  the  difficulties
    faced by asylum seekers in producing corroborative  evidence.    In  TK
    (Burundi) v SSHD (2009) EWCA Civ 40 the Court of Appeal said that where
    there  were  circumstances  in   which   evidence   corroborating   the
    appellant's evidence was easily obtainable, the lack of  such  evidence
    must affect the assessment of the appellant's credibility.  It followed
    that where a judge in assessing credibility relied  on  the  fact  that
    there was no independent supporting evidence where there should be  and
    there was no credible account for its absence, he committed no error of
    law when he relied on that  fact  for  rejecting  the  account  of  the
    appellant.  In this case the evidence concerned a partner in the UK.

11. The Qualification Directive, reflected in paragraph 339L, provides that
    it is the duty of the person to substantiate the asylum claim and where
    aspects of the applicant's statements are not supported by  documentary
    or other evidence, those aspects shall not need confirmation  when  all
    of the following conditions are met:  (i)  the  applicant  has  made  a
    genuine effort to  substantiate  his  application;  (ii)  all  material
    factors  at  the  applicant's  disposal  have  been  submitted,  and  a
    satisfactory explanation has been given regarding  any  lack  of  other
    relevant material; (iii) the applicant's statements  are  found  to  be
    coherent and plausible and do not run counter to available specific and
    general  information  relevant  to  the  applicant's  case;  (iv)   the
    applicant has applied for  international  protection  at  the  earliest
    possible time, unless the applicant can demonstrate good reason for not
    having done so; and (v) the general credibility of  the  applicant  has
    been established. It is clear  from  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  that  on  any  view  the  appellant  does  not   meet   these
    requirements.

12. Although it is frequently necessary to give  an  asylum  applicant  the
    benefit of the doubt,  where  there  are  strong  reasons  to  question
    veracity, as arise in this case from the appellant's  various  previous
    claims and the other matters drawn  attention  to  by  the  immigration
    judge, the  individual  can  be  expected  to  provide  a  satisfactory
    explanation  for  the  absence   of   supporting   evidence.   In   the
    circumstances, it was not  wrong  for  the  judge  to  point  out,  for
    example, that claims that the authorities visited family  home  because
    of the appellant's activities might reasonably expect to  be  supported
    by oral evidence from the appellant's sister, or an explanation offered
    as to why she could not assist. Neither do I find any error of  law  in
    the judge's placing no weight on emails from family members. Whilst the
    judge is correct to point out that these are  necessarily  self-serving
    and not independent confirmation of the appellant's account, the weight
    to be attached to such evidence is a matter for the  judge,  though  he
    might have better suggested little weight rather than no weight.

13. There is a minor error of fact in the findings at �16, where the  judge
    stated that the appellant made no assertion that the  compromising  sex
    video was referred to or led to problems for her at any  time.  At  Q37
    and Q46 of the asylum interview, the appellant  repeated  her  previous
    claim that she was arrested because  of  the  circulation  of  the  CD.
    However, this claim had been comprehensively rejected in  the  previous
    Tribunal appeal decision, as noted at �15 of Judge Black's decision. At
    �16 Judge Black stated that the  appellant  had  not  adduced  any  new
    evidence to lead the Tribunal to revisit  the  findings  made  in  that
    previous appeal decision. In the circumstances, even if the  judge  had
    taken account of the repetition of the claim in  relation  to  the  sex
    video,  it  is  abundantly  clear  that  that  alone  would  have  been
    insufficient to displace the previous comprehensive  findings  on  that
    issue. In the circumstances, there is no error of law in this regard.

14. The judge was required to take  account  of  the  appellant's  previous
    rejected asylum claims: her claim to have been  video  recorded  whilst
    engaged in sexual acts, and that she is a Christian convert from Islam.
    As the judge stated at �16 the appellant adduced no evidence  that  led
    Judge Black to revisit the findings made in the first decision. Neither
    did the judge find her claim to  have  been  accused  of  being  a  spy
    credible.

15. Mr Bonavero relies on what he claimed was an inconsistency  in  �17  of
    the decision, where the judge accepted that the  circumstances  of  the
    appellant's return to  Iran  accompanied  by  escorts  may  have  drawn
    attention to her at the airport, and  the  finding  that  there  is  no
    evidence to support her claim that she was detained or  otherwise  ill-
    treated, or of adverse attention to the authorities. Mr Bonavero points
    out that it would be difficult if not  impossible  to  obtain  evidence
    that she had been detained and questioned at  the  airport.  I  do  not
    accept, however, that the judge is here requiring corroboration of  her
    account. The judge has to assess this appellant on  the  basis  of  the
    previous findings of various  incredible  claims.  Obviously,  any  new
    claim has to be regarded with the greatest degree of caution. It is not
    wrong for the judge to point out that  there  is  no  support  for  the
    claim, other than the appellant's own assertions.  Further,  the  judge
    gives in �17 two additional reasons for rejecting this account.  First,
    that it is not credible that if she admitted to  the  authorities  that
    she was a spy that she  would  be  released  as  claimed.  Second,  the
    failure of the appellant to give  consistent  detailed  information  in
    interview at her earliest opportunity and that much of  the  claim  was
    added in her later witness statement. Associated with this same  issue,
    the judge  also  noted  the  appellant's  sister  had  not  given  oral
    evidence, although she was living with the appellant in the UK.

16. Mr Bonavero  also  suggests  that  the  judge  was  improperly  seeking
    corroboration at �20 of the decision when it was noted that  there  was
    no independent evidence to confirm that the cyber warning purporting to
    be from the Iranian authorities was authentic. The judge also doubt the
    credibility of the evidence adduced of the first blog. I find that  the
    judge was doing no more than  pointing  out  the  obvious,  that  these
    documents do not in and of themselves amount to independent support for
    the claim made by the appellant. The fact that some  of  the  documents
    have the internet address of the blog on them does not demonstrate that
    they are necessarily genuine. Neither do I accept  that  the  documents
    show the dates on which they were posted, although there is a  list  of
    dates of previous postings  down  the  left-hand  margin  of  A12.  The
    translations are, in my view, very poor, difficult  to  understand  and
    fail to demonstrate anything  other  than  generalised  statements.  It
    appears that only the headings of the blogs have  been  translated,  as
    well as parts of  two  blogs,  one  complaining  about  the  spread  of
    prostitution in Iran, which seems ironic given the appellant's claim to
    have worked as a prostitute herself. It is clear that the vast majority
    of what is written on pages A14 -A22 has not been  translated,  as  the
    judge noted at �21. The judge also correctly noted that the cyber block
    document at A23 is dated 22.8.12, after the appellant returned  to  the
    UK. There is no evidence, as the judge noted, that this  is  a  genuine
    document. As I discussed with Mr Bonavero, anyone with a computer could
    create such a document, or indeed the so-called blog pages. No evidence
    was presented to the judge to demonstrate that these pages were in fact
    online on the Internet.  This  was  evidence  which  should  have  been
    reasonably easily obtained and produced. The judge was entitled to note
    the  lack  of  such  evidence  and  to  draw  conclusions  relevant  to
    credibility from the absence of such evidence.

17. The weight to be attached to the rather limited evidence was in the end
    a matter entirely for the First-tier Tribunal Judge, who  concludes  at
    �21 that it was insufficient to demonstrate to the  lower  standard  of
    proof that this appellant set up  a  blog  which  was  active  in  Iran
    between 2011 and 2012, and in the UK. Within  �21  the  judge  set  out
    cogent reasoning for  reaching  this  conclusion.  I  find  that  is  a
    conclusion open to the judge on the evidence in the appellant's bundle,
    including the purported blog pages,  the  majority  of  which  was  not
    translated and its source and date  of  creation  entirely  unclear.  I
    reject the assertion that this amounted  to  improper  requirement  for
    corroboration. It would have been possible and  reasonable  to  provide
    better evidence at least for some of the matters  referred  to  by  the
    judge. In the circumstances, I find no material error  of  law  in  the
    judge's treatment  of  this  evidence.  It  is  on  the  basis  of  the
    conclusions about this evidence that the judge came to  the  conclusion
    that there is nothing to indicate that the appellant  is  or  would  be
    perceived by the Iranian authorities as an activist.

18. In essence, the appellant's case turned on her credibility,  which  was
    already severely damaged by the previous  asylum  claims  found  to  be
    entirely incredible. It is clear from �22 that the judge considered the
    evidence as a whole, in the round,  including  both  the  first  appeal
    decision and the appellant's immigration history. Her claim was largely
    unsupported by credible confirmation evidence. The judge  gave  reasons
    for finding that the  claim  was  in  essence  unsupported.  There  was
    evidence that it would have been reasonable to expect the appellant  to
    provide to confirm or corroborate her claim, which was not produced.  I
    find it was open to the judge on the evidence before  the  Tribunal  to
    conclude that there was no reason to depart from the  findings  of  the
    first Tribunal judge, and that, considered as a whole, the  appellant's
    account was not credible and should be rejected.

Conclusions:

19. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity
order. Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee order.
