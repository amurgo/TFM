Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Robb, of Gray & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwyncz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Hussain, promulgated on 5 April 2016,  dismissing  his  appeal  against
    refusal of entry clearance to join his wife in the UK for settlement.

 2. The principal ground of appeal to the UT is that  the  Judge  erred  by
    dealing with the case "on the papers", and failing to  adjourn  for  an
    oral hearing.

 3. The Judge expressed concern at �11  -  12  that  the  sponsor  had  not
    requested an oral hearing, and reflected on how  useful  oral  evidence
    might have been in enabling the Judge to form a view of the nature  and
    quality of a relationship.  The ground  of  appeal  founds  upon  those
    observations.

 4. The absence of an offer to lead oral evidence from the  sponsor  was  a
    rational point for the Judge to take, although any request for  her  to
    give such evidence would have had to come not from  her  but  from  the
    appellant, whose case it was,  accompanied  by  the  fee  for  an  oral
    hearing.

 5. The evidence which the appellant did place before the tribunal included
    a letter from the sponsor dated 29 March 2015, which says at  the  end,
    "I hope this information is enough."   There  is  and  was  no  witness
    statement from her expressing a wish to give oral evidence.

 6. The choice to have  the  case  dealt  with  "on  the  papers"  was  the
    appellant's.  There was nothing before the Judge to  indicate  that  it
    might be an error of  law,  or  constitute  procedural  unfairness,  to
    proceed as the appellant said he wished to do.

 7. The appellant has tendered no witness statements  to  demonstrate  that
    the evidence might have been any different if an oral hearing had  been
    offered.

 8. The duty on Judges is generally to resolve cases on the evidence  which
    parties elect to place before them, not to  offer  parties  unsolicited
    adjournments and guidance on how to improve their cases.  It is  seldom
    wrong in law or procedurally unfair to proceed  to  decision.   We  see
    nothing in this case whereby the Judge was not right to proceed as  the
    appellant asked.

 9. The conclusion drawn by the Judge was that the evidence fell  short  of
    establishing   a   subsisting   relationship.    That   conclusion   is
    unimpeachable as a matter of law.  It disposes of all the grounds.

10. As the Judge observed at �13, the appellant might choose to reapply and
    provide further evidence.  If the situation is as he  claims,  that  is
    the appropriate course.  Failure to put evidence before  the  FtT  does
    not translate into error of law or procedural unfairness by way  of  an
    obligation on the FtT to invite the appellant to make  a  better  case.



11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

12. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
