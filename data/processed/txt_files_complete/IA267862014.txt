                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Gurung-Thapa, promulgated on 12th  September  2014,  following  a
    hearing at  Stoke-on-Trent  on  21st  August  2014.   The  hearing  was
    conducted "on the papers".  The judge dismissed the  appeal  of  Foysal
    Ahmed.  The Appellant  subsequently,  applied  for,  and  was  granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Bangladesh, who was born on  10th
    August 1987.   He  appeals  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 16th June 2014, refusing to vary his leave  to
    remain in the UK, consequent upon his application  to  remain  in  this
    country as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he is in a position to show possession of
    ï¿½2,200 for a consecutive 28 day period, such as to meet the maintenance
    requirements.  The judge found that the Appellant "submitted an ad  hoc
    printout bank statement but it was  not  in  the  appropriate  format".
    (Paragraph 6).  The application was refused  under  paragraph  245ZX(c)
    and (d) of the Immigration Rules.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge considered that the Appellant's  CAS  was  assigned  on  29th
    April 2014 to study a diploma in strategic management which is  at  NQF
    level 7, and is above degree level.  (Paragraph 3).  The Appellant  has
    submitted a City and Guilds certificate with his application  "but  the
    certificate did not show that the Appellant  had  passed  the  speaking
    component of the test" for the English language (at paragraph 3).

 5. Accordingly, on 29th May 2014 the Respondent  contacted  the  Appellant
    "to request the correct document and provided the deadline on 9th  June
    2014 for the document to be submitted.  The Appellant failed to  supply
    a new document within the deadline as requested" (paragraph 4).

 6. The judge concluded that, "as correct evidence has not  been  submitted
    the Appellant has not achieved the minimum standard of English  in  all
    four components of the English language test  which  is  required.   No
    points were awarded for the CAS" (paragraph 5).

 7. Before the judge, it had been suggested by the Appellant  that  he  was
    not contacted by the Respondent (paragraph  10).   The  judge  reasoned
    that,

         "Whether or not the Appellant was contacted by  the  Respondent,  I
         note it is significant that the Appellant has not  dealt  with  the
         issue that he failed to provide the city and guilds certificate  to
         show that he had passed the speaking component of  the  test.   The
         Appellant I note had only submitted the city and guilds certificate
         for reading, writing and listening" (paragraph 11).

    Accordingly, the judge had no doubt that "the Appellant does  not  meet
    the requirement of paragraph 245ZX(c)" (at paragraph 12).   The  appeal
    was dismissed.





Grounds of Application

 8. In his grounds of application,  the  Appellant  concedes  that  he  was
    contacted by the Respondent Secretary of State but the e-mail went into
    his junk box.

 9. On 7th November 2014 permission to appeal was granted.  However, it was
    granted with full recognition of the fact that this was  not  the  only
    basis for the Secretary of State's refusal because "the application had
    also been refused on maintenance grounds and the judge  found  that  it
    did not appear that  he  had  sent  the  correct  original  bundles  in
    relation to this issue" (see paragraph 2 of the grant of permission).

10. Nevertheless, because the Appellant was  maintaining  that  the  e-mail
    request from the Respondent had gone  into  his  junk  box,  the  judge
    should  have  satisfied  herself  that  the  Appellant   had   received
    communication from the Respondent as he maintained.

11. On 19th November 2014 a Rule 24 response was entered.  This  makes  two
    specific points.  First, that it now appeared clear that the  Appellant
    had conceded that the e-mail went into his junk  mail.   This  suggests
    that it was received.  If it was received then it was sent.  If it  was
    sent, then the Appellant should have responded to it.  Second, even  if
    there was no issue with respect to the e-mail going into the junk  box,
    the fact was that the Appellant did not provide the required  documents
    to meet the Rule.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me, there was no attendance by the  Appellant  or
    by a legal representative on his behalf.   I  note  that  the  previous
    hearing had been conducted also "on the papers".  Nor,  was  there  any
    explanation given on  this  occasion  why  the  Appellant  was  not  in
    attendance.  Appearing on behalf of the Respondent Secretary of  State,
    Mr Tarlow submitted that he would  place  reliance  upon  the  Rule  24
    response.  First, the Appellant admits that he was sent  an  e-mail  by
    the Respondent  requesting  him  to  provide  the  original  documents.
    Second, he did not provide the documents, and did not do so before  the
    original judge, and has  not  done  so  before  this  Tribunal  either.
    Therefore, the documents do not exist.  If they do not exist, the error
    by the judge, such as it was, could not be a material error.

No Error of Law

13. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.

14. First, it is clear that a request had gone out by the Respondent to the
    Appellant.  The Appellant wrongly argued before the original judge that
    there was no such request.  It is only in his Grounds of Appeal that it
    is clear that he did receive this, albeit in his junk box.   He  should
    have checked his junk box.

15. Second, and in any event, the judge's reasoning was on the basis  that,
    "whether or not the Appellant was contacted by the Respondent I note it
    is significant that the Appellant has not dealt with the issue that  he
    failed to provide the city and guilds certificate ...  ..."  (paragraph
    11).  This suggests that the judge considered the position  from  every
    angle and concluded that the failure on  the  part  of  the  Appellant,
    namely, his failure in providing a city and guilds certificate  showing
    that he had passed the speaking component of the English language test,
    was such as would place him outside paragraph 245ZX(c).

16. Third, there was no evidence even before the original judge, and  there
    is no evidence even before this Tribunal today.  Accordingly, there has
    simply been a failure to provide the evidence which the Appellant knows
    should have been provided.  The decision of the judge was the only  one
    open to her.

Decision

17. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

18. No anonymity order is made.
