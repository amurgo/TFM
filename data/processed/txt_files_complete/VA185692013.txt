Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Rahman (Sponsor)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the respondent and to the  respondent
    as the appellant (as  they  were  respectively  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal).

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 6 March  1986.   He  had
    applied for a visit visa that had been refused by  a  decision  of  the
    respondent dated 23 September 2013.  He had appealed to the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge N J Osborne) which, in a determination  promulgated  on
    19 June 2014 allowed the  appeal.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  now
    appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 3. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal must be set  aside.   This
    is an appeal which was limited to grounds of race relations  and  human
    rights only (see Section 84(1)(c) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002).  The appellant is the nephew of  the  United  Kingdom
    sponsor.  The judge had no jurisdiction to allow the appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  Human rights (including Article 8  ECHR)  were  not
    pleaded in the grounds of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   It  is
    difficult to see how Article 8 may, in any  event,  be  engaged  in  an
    application based upon the facts as set out in the papers.

 4. In consequence,  I  set  aside  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.   I  have  remade  the  decision.   The  appeal  against  the
    respondent's refusal dated 23 September 2013 is dismissed.

DECISION

 5. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal dated 19 June 2014 is  set
    aside.  I have remade the decision.  The appeal against the decision of
    the respondent dated 23 September 2013 is dismissed.
