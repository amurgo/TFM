                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Farhan Anjum, was born on 25 August 1985 and is  a  male
    citizen of Pakistan.  The appellant appealed against a  decision  dated
    28 March 2013 to refuse him further  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.  The appellant  appealed
    against that decision to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Shimmin) which,
    in a determination promulgated  on  13  February  2014,  dismissed  the
    appeal.  The appellant now  appeals,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. The First-tier Tribunal resolved one of the reasons for the refusal  of
    the appellant's application in the appellant's favour; at  [20],  Judge
    Shimmin agreed with the appellant's  representative's  submission  that
    the Certificate of  Acceptance  for  Studies  (CAS)  should  have  been
    requested by the respondent  pursuant  to  the  evidential  flexibility
    policy in force at that time.  At the  Upper  Tribunal  hearing  on  24
    April 2014, the appellant did not attend although  his  representatives
    sent in a letter which I have considered.  Mr Spence, who appeared  for
    the respondent, made no submissions in respect of the CAS.   I  do  not
    propose to disturb that part of Judge Shimmin's determination.

 3. The remaining ground, therefore, concerns the  appellant's  failure  to
    show that he had adequate maintenance (funds) in  accordance  with  the
    Rules.  The appellant has supplied a Halifax current account  statement
    (printed 30 January 2014) which  showed  transactions  on  his  account
    between 7 January 2013 and  15  January  2013,  a  period  of  8  days.
    Throughout that period, there had been a balance in excess  of  �2,000.
    As the refusal letter noted, the appellant had failed  to  comply  with
    the requirement under Appendix C  of  the  Immigration  Rules  that  he
    should be in possession of �2,000  for  a  consecutive  28  day  period
    before the date of the application.  The appellant had  also  submitted
    to the respondent a letter  from  Halifax  dated  7  February  2013  to
    confirm that, as of 7 February 2013, the  balance  on  the  appellant's
    account was �2,000.10.  The appellant submits  that  the  Halifax  Bank
    letter "demonstrated sufficient reason for the respondent to  at  least
    request  an  explanation/clarification  from  the  appellant  for  [his
    Halifax account]."  I note from the policy which appears to  have  been
    in force at the date of decision (version 2.0 which had been valid from
    20 May 2013) a decision-maker could exercise a discretion to contact an
    applicant  "if  there  are  minor  errors  or  omissions  on  a   valid
    application but there is enough evidence to show the application  would
    otherwise be granted."  The decision-maker may, in those circumstances,
    "request missing documents and/or information."  The policy is  subject
    to the proviso that "before requesting the additional evidence we  must
    have sufficient reasons to believe the information exists...."

 4. Judge Shimmin [24] rejected the argument  that  the  respondent  should
    have applied the policy.  He found  that  "The  [bank]  statement  only
    speaks of the balances which are dated in the body  of  the  statement.
    In this  case,  they  are  7-15  January  2013  and  do  not  meet  the
    requirement of the period up to 7 February 2013."

 5. I agree with Judge Shimmin  that  the  letter  from  the  Halifax  does
    nothing more than to confirm the balance on the account on a particular
    date.  It would have been a simple matter for  the  appellant  to  have
    requested the Halifax to confirm in writing that from 15  January  2013
    until 7 February 2013 the balance on the account  had  always  been  in
    excess of �2,000.  There is nothing arising from the Halifax letter  or
    from the statement to suggest the existence of any document which would
    provide the information required to meet the Rules; there was no reason
    for the respondent to suppose that an additional bank statement existed
    showing the balance for the  missing  period  whilst  it  was  entirely
    reasonable to assume that there was no further letter from the  Halifax
    in existence  which  would  provide  the  necessary  information.   The
    appellant is, in effect, suggesting that  the  respondent  should  have
    given him a further opportunity to obtain fresh evidence which was  not
    in existence at the time  of  his  application  but  which  might  have
    enabled him to satisfy the Rules.  The respondent's flexibility  policy
    did not exist to address such circumstances.  I find,  therefore,  that
    Judge  Shimmin  did  not  err  in  law  by  rejecting  the  appellant's
    submission that the policy had  been  engaged  in  this  instance.   It
    follows that Judge Shimmin was therefore correct to find the  appellant
    had failed to satisfy the necessary  requirement  and  to  dismiss  his
    appeal.

 6. The grounds of appeal do not challenge the judge's finding  in  respect
    of Article 8 ECHR.

DECISION

 7. This appeal is dismissed.
