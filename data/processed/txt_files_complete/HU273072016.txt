                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh born on 14th June 1991 and he
    applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom  on  a  spousal  visa  in
    order to be with his wife who is a British citizen. The Entry Clearance
    Officer on 21st November 2016 refused the application with reference to
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules on the basis of the following:

    (i) under the suitability requirements the sponsor had failed to submit
    a written undertaking to be responsible for the applicant's maintenance
    and accommodation

    (ii) it was not accepted  that  there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship because there were discrepancies as to when they first met
    and there was a lack of evidence of contact since they were married

    (iii) the applicant failed to satisfy  the  financial  requirements  to
    establish that the sponsor was earning ï¿½18,600 a year. The sponsor  had
    failed to provide the required wage slips and personal bank statements.

 2. The appellant appealed that refusal and in a determination  dated  25th
    of October 2017 Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Thorne  refused  the
    appellant's appeal on all grounds.

Application for Permission to Appeal


 3. The application for permission advanced the following grounds:

    (i) there was a failure to properly consider article 8 of the ECHR. The
    Secretary of State  was  duty-bound  to  consider  the  impact  of  the
    decision-making on the applicant's  family  including  his  sister  and
    nieces  and  nephews.  It  was  clear  that  the  continued  separation
    interfered with their private and family life and breach  their  rights
    under article 8

    (ii) the decision was irrational and made  a  irrational  findings  and
    there was a failure to discharge the burden of  proof.  The  judge  had
    stated that the level of contact  had  not  been  established  but  the
    marriage certificate was placed in front of the judge and had not  been
    properly considered and the marriage was  evidence  in  itself  of  the
    relationship being genuine and subsisting. It was  submitted  that  the
    judge had failed properly to follow the step-by-step  process  required
    to determine whether the relevant burden and standard of proof had been
    established to prove that there was a marriage of convenience.  It  was
    submitted that the tribunal  had  departed  from  the  well-established
    principle of that  the  pendulum  only  things  to  the  appellant  the
    Secretary of State to satisfy the tribunal that a reasonable  suspicion
    had been made out.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chohan
    who observed that the judge's decision was difficult to  follow,  large
    parts of the decision were composed of jurisprudence and  the  law  and
    the gist of the findings appeared at paragraphs 60 but  there  appeared
    to be a lack of reasoning for the findings made.

 5. A Rule 24 response was filed by the Secretary of State on behalf of the
    entry clearance officer which argued that the  judge  directed  himself
    appropriately and he found that there was little evidence  to  indicate
    that the marriage was genuine and subsisting and  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to make this finding on the evidence before the tribunal.  The
    judge applied the correct burden and standard of proof.

The Hearing


 6. At the hearing, Mrs Malik submitted that article 8 was  not  considered
    properly and was vital.  She relied on the written grounds  of  appeal.
    She accepted that the photographs had  been  placed  before  the  entry
    clearance officer.

 7. Miss Fijiwala submitted that there was no material error of  law.   The
    judge  had  addressed  the  issues  and  his  findings  were  clear  at
    paragraphs 26  to  32.  Essentially  the  appellant  had  not  met  the
    suitability requirements and at paragraph 24 the judge noted  that  the
    sponsor was too embarrassed to submit evidence of contact  between  the
    appellant and herself. There was a finding that the rules  under  FM-SE
    the  appendix  FM  were  not  met.  The  decision  was  given  in   the
    alternative.  First  the  judge  did  not  accept  that  there  was   a
    relationship such  that  a  proportionality  assessment  needed  to  be
    undertaken but the judge nevertheless went on to consider article 8 and
    his findings were sufficient.

 8. I was directed to paragraph 61 of the  judge's  decision.  Overall  the
    rules had not been met and it was open to the judge as to the weight to
    be accorded  to  the  evidence.  I  was  referred  to  specifically  to
    paragraph 60 (f) and (e) where the judge found  he  was  not  satisfied
    that the financial requirements have been satisfied  and  further  that
    there was inadequate evidence that suitable accommodation was available
    in the UK.  There  was  a  clear  lack  of  evidence  of  a  subsisting
    relationship since the marriage

Conclusions


 9. The grounds are essentially intertwined.  From reading the decision  it
    is not arguable that the judge  failed  to  follow  the  step  by  step
    process.  Contrary to the grant of permission to appeal,  I  find  that
    the decision was a not difficult to  follow.  The  judge  set  out  the
    jurisprudence at length  which  may  have  been  unnecessary  but  this
    demonstrated that the judge directed himself appropriately legally  and
    those legal directions were not challenged. Specifically  his  findings
    were at paragraphs 25 onwards. The judge was critical of the appeal  on
    the basis that the sponsor had still failed  to  submit  a  signed  and
    dated  written  undertaking  to  be  responsible  for   her   husband's
    maintenance accommodation and that  she  had  still  failed  to  submit
    adequate evidence of contact between herself and  the  applicant  since
    they were married. Contrary to the  grounds  the  marriage  certificate
    itself was not disputed and this was before the entry clearance officer
    who challenged the subsequent contact to evidence the genuine nature of
    the relationship. A certificate itself does not  necessarily  take  the
    matter forward.  As the judge pointed out,  little more  was  submitted
    by way of evidence and the judge noted at paragraph 24 that "S was  too
    embarrassed to submit evidence of her communications with A" [since the
    marriage]. That in effect is an acceptance that no further evidence  of
    communication had been submitted and  bearing  in  mind  the  criticism
    within the refusal of the evidence of telephone calls and  the  limited
    contact between the  appellant  and  his  sponsor  and  which  put  the
    appellant on notice of that which was required regarding  contact,  the
    judge was entitled to find that there had  been  a  failure  to  submit
    adequate evidence.

10. That finding followed on from  a  finding  on  the  evidence  that  the
    sponsor had  still  failed  to  submit  a  written  undertaking  to  be
    responsible for the appellant's maintenance and accommodation. That  in
    itself also undermined the  contention  of  a  relationship  which  was
    subsisting.

11. I was referred to the evidence in the bundle but this  did  nothing  to
    undermine the findings of the judge  as  it  consisted  of  photographs
    which were  already  before  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  some  pay
    receipt, an un-signed statement (although I accept the sponsor attended
    the hearing and adopted her statement), a marriage certificate  and  an
    unsigned  undertaking  with  respect  to  financial  and  accommodation
    responsibility. There was nothing  in  the  witness  statement  of  the
    sponsor to demonstrate unjustifiably harsh consequences as a result  of
    the decision.   Merely at paragraph 4 the sponsor recorded that she had
    no promise of employment Bangladesh.

12. Bearing in mind that this was an entry clearance application I fail  to
    see the relevance of the reference to nieces, aunt and  sister  in  the
    grounds, and if this referred to those in the United Kingdom there  was
    no evidence that the relationship with those  relatives  gave  rise  to
    article 8 protected rights.

13. The judge clearly set out the burden and standard of proof at paragraph
    19 and it is evident on  reading  of  the  decision  overall  that  the
    standard of proof applied was that of the balance of probabilities. The
    judge was correct that the burden of proof rested with  the  appellant.
    It was for the appellant show that he  had  a  subsisting  relationship
    with his sponsor.  The judge made a finding at paragraph 49 that he did
    not accept that it had been established on the balance of probabilities
    there was an existing family life between the appellant and the sponsor
    as man and wife. That would negate the requirement  for  the  judge  to
    proceed to the proportionality assessment. Nonetheless the judge did go
    on to consider proportionality and undertake a balancing exercise  and,
    as he was obliged  to  do,  applied  section  117  of  the  Nationality
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

14. The reference to "marriage of convenience" suggests that the grounds of
    appeal have been settled with the EEA regulations in mind and of course
    this is an entry clearance application and the  immigration  rules  are
    those which are applicable. Nevertheless the judge did  assess  whether
    there was a genuine relationship  demonstrated  by  the  appellant  and
    found for  cogent  reasons  that  there  was  not.   That  finding  was
    adequately reasoned and open to the judge.

15. The judge conducted the proportionality balance having  considered  the
    immigration rules, which reflect  the  position  of  the  Secretary  of
    State, and the judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  the  there  was  a
    legitimate interest in maintaining effective immigration  control.  The
    judge was  entitled  to  conclude  that  the  appellant  could  not  be
    maintained economically in the UK because the sponsor had not  met  the
    financial requirements owing to the inadequate reliable evidence before
    him.  There was further inadequate evidence that suitable accommodation
    was available. Specifically the judge found that there  was  inadequate
    evidence to establish on the balance probabilities that  the  appellant
    sponsor could not continue their family  life  outside  the  UK.     At
    paragraph 61 the judge found that the public  interest  outweighed  the
    human rights of the appellant and the is right so clearly considered.

16. There is nothing in the decision which can be established as irrational
    or meets the high threshold of perversity. In sum there was a  lack  of
    evidence in the appeal to  demonstrate  fulfilment  o  the  immigration
    requirements  and  a  lack  of  evidence  to  show  that   there   were
    unjustifiably harsh consequences flowing from the refusal.

17. The decision of Judge Thorne discloses no material  error  of  law  and
    will stand.
