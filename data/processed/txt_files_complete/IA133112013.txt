Representation:
                            For the Appellant: Ms S Naik of counsel
       instructed by Legal Rights Partnership LLP
For the Respondent: Mr C Avery a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 13 April 1986.  He
   has been given permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of  First-Tier
   Tribunal Judge Nicholls ("the FTTJ") who dismissed his appeal against the
   respondent's decision of 5 April 2013 to refuse  to  vary  his  leave  to
   enter or remain in the UK on human rights grounds.

2. The appellant arrived in the UK on 27 November 2011 with leave  to  enter
   as a visitor for up to 6 months. This leave was due to expire on 6  April
   2012. During the period of this leave the appellant met and  married  his
   wife who is a British citizen whose family were originally from Pakistan.
   The application was made by solicitors on behalf of the appellant who, in
   their letter dated 3 April 2012 said that his wife suffered from a slight
   learning difficulty and was not able to work. The appellant did not  want
   to be separated from her and argued that it would  be  a  breach  of  his
   human rights  if  he  had  to  return  to  Pakistan.  The  basis  of  the
   application set out in the letter is important and I will return to this.

3. The respondent considered the application under the Article 8  principles
   set out in Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. The appellant fell  foul
   of the non-switching requirements in E-LTRP  2.1  and  the  exemption  in
   paragraph EX.1. did not apply. The respondent concluded that  there  were
   no insurmountable  obstacles  preventing  the  relationship  between  the
   appellant and his wife continuing in Pakistan. They had no children.  The
   appellant did not meet the  requirements  for  leave  to  remain  on  the
   grounds of his private life in the UK.

4. The appellant appealed and the FTTJ heard his appeal on 11 October  2013.
   Both parties were represented, the  appellant  by  Ms  Naik  who  appears
   before me. The FTTJ heard oral evidence from the appellant and his sister-
   in-law. The appellant's wife did not give evidence, although she attended
   the hearing.

5. The FTTJ  found  that  the  appellant  had  not  shown  that  there  were
   insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in  Pakistan.  He  was
   not entitled to the benefit of exception EX.1. The FTTJ took into account
   the principles set out in MA (Pakistan)  [2009] EWCA  Civ  953  and  Hyat
   (Pakistan) [2012] EWCA Civ 1054  that  it  would  be  a  disproportionate
   interference with family or private life were Article 8 engaged simply to
   enforce the policy that an  applicant  must  return  to  the  country  of
   nationality to apply for entry clearance. Where  there  was  no  sensible
   reason for enforcing the policy the decision maker should  determine  the
   Article 8 claim on it substantive merits. The FTTJ went  on  to  consider
   the Article 8 grounds outside the Immigration Rules  under  what  I  will
   refer to as the Strasbourg jurisprudence. He concluded that there was  no
   evidence to show that it would be unreasonable to expect the family  life
   created in the UK to be continued in  Pakistan.  Applying  the  five-step
   Razgar tests he answered the  first  four  in  the  affirmative  and,  in
   relation  to  the  last,  proportionality  that  it  would   not   be   a
   disproportionate interference with the private and family  lives  of  the
   appellant  and  his  wife  to  require  him  to  leave  the  UK  and,  by
   implication, his wife with him.

6. The appellant applied for and was  granted  permission  to  appeal  by  a
   judge in the First-Tier Tribunal. The grounds of appeal submit  that  the
   FTTJ erred in law. Firstly, by failing to address the argument  that  the
   "no switching" policy in Appendix FM To the Immigration Rules as  applied
   to this appellant represented a disproportionate  interference  with  his
   and his wife's rights to private and family life. Secondly, by failing to
   take  into  account  relevant  factors  such  as   the   wife's   British
   citizenship, her inability to speak relevant languages or the loss of the
   benefits and support she receives in this country because of her learning
   disability and speech impediment. Thirdly, by imposing a requirement  for
   corroborative evidence as to the wife's disability.

7. I have before me what I am told are all the documents which  were  before
   the FTTJ including the skeleton argument submitted  to  the  FTTJ  by  Ms
   Naik, her skeleton argument for today's hearing and a  folder  containing
   authorities and legal materials.

8. I drew Ms Naik's attention to the appellant's  solicitor's  letter  of  3
   April 2012. She said that she only had alternate pages.  I  provided  her
   with a copy. She relied  on  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  her  skeleton
   argument In reply to my question she accepted that the decision in  Zhang
   v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 891 (Admin)  was
   not binding on the Upper Tribunal although  she  argued  that  it  was  a
   strong persuasive effect. I was referred to R (Aguilar Quila and another)
   v Secretary Of State for the  Home  Department  [2011]  UKSC  45  between
   paragraphs 67 and 74. The Immigration Rule which  refused  to  permit  an
   applicant  to  switch  between  categories  was  not  justified  in   the
   circumstances of this case and should have been held to be  invalid.  She
   accepted that the Upper  Tribunal  could  not  quash  such  a  rule.  She
   submitted that the FTTJ should  have  remitted  the  application  to  the
   respondent to reconsider on this basis because her decision  was  not  in
   accordance with the law. However, this would only be necessary if it  was
   not possible to determine the application and appeal on some other  basis
   namely the Article 8 provisions in the Strasbourg jurisprudence. In reply
   to my question, she said this meant that the  respondent  would  need  to
   consider the application under paragraph 284  of  the  Immigration  Rules
   even  though  the  appellant  had  not  provided  information  with   the
   application to show how he claimed to meet the requirements of this rule.
   The FTTJ should have concluded that  the  non-switching  provisions  were
   invalid and allowed the appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds  if,  in
   substance, he accepted that the requirements  of  paragraph  284  of  the
   Immigration Rules were met.

9. Ms Naik relied on her skeleton and the grounds of appeal in  relation  to
   grounds 2 and 3. In relation to ground 2 she submitted that paragraph  14
   of the grounds, which came under ground  1,  should  also  be  considered
   under ground 2.

10. I was asked to find that the FTTJ erred in law  and  that  his  decision
   should be set aside. If an error of law was found and the  rehearing  was
   adjourned she asked that this take place in the First-Tier Tribunal.  The
   appellant wished to submit evidence to  show  that  the  requirements  of
   paragraph 284 of the Immigration Rules were met.

11. Mr Avery submitted that the application made to the  respondent  was  on
   the basis that the non-switching provisions applied. This was  the  basis
   on which the application was considered  and  it  was  not  open  to  the
   appellant to raise the issue at some later date.  There  were  clear  and
   proper policy reasons for the non-switching provisions and these were set
   out in the appellant's bundle.

12. He argued that ground 2 was no more  than  disagreements  with  findings
   properly made by the FTTJ. There was an appropriate assessment of all the
   evidence and he reached conclusions open to him on that  evidence.  There
   was no indication that the documents from  the  Department  of  Work  and
   Pensions had been put before the FTTJ (Ms Naik accepted this).  The  FTTJ
   had not suggested that the appellant was in this country  unlawfully  and
   took no adverse point on his status. There was clear consideration of the
   position of the appellant and his wife if he had to  go  to  Pakistan.  I
   raised a point in relation to paragraph  16  of  the  grounds  of  appeal
   relating to the languages not spoken or written by the appellant's  wife.
   Neither representative was  able  to  point  me  to  any  evidence  which
   indicated the first languages of the appellant and his wife.  I  reserved
   my determination.

13. In the letter of 3 April 2012 from  the  appellant's  solicitors  making
   the application to the respondent the third paragraph states; "Our client
   meets all the main requirements  of  paragraph  284  of  the  immigration
   rules. However, paragraph 284 (i) does not permit  a  visitor  to  switch
   leave to remain in the UK on  the  basis  of  marriage.  Accordingly  our
   client's case falls for consideration under article 8 of  the  ECHR.  The
   reasons given below we would submit that our client has a compelling case
   the grant of leave to remain in the UK".

14. The immigration status requirements in E-LTRP.2.1 and 2.2 are that;


      "The applicant must not be in the UK-
      (a) as a visitor;
      (b) with valid leave granted for a period of 6 months or less,  unless
      that leave is as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner, or was granted
      pending the outcome of family court or divorce proceedings; or
      (c) on temporary admission  or  temporary  release  (unless  paragraph
      EX.1. applies).
      2.2. The applicant must not be in the UK in breach of immigration laws
      (disregarding any period of overstaying for a period  of  28  days  or
      less), unless paragraph EX.1. applies."


15. Section EX.1 states;


    "This paragraph applies if
    (i) the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  parental  relationship
    with a child who-
    (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the  age  of  18  years
    when the applicant was first granted  leave  on  the  basis  that  this
    paragraph applied;
    (bb) is in the UK;
    (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK  continuously  for  at
    least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of application; and
    (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK; or
    (b) the applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
    partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in the UK or
    in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life with  that  partner  continuing
    outside the UK."


16. The provisions of paragraph 284 of the  Immigration  Rules  setting  out
   the requirements for an extension of stay as the spouse or civil  partner
   of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom are that:


    "(i) the applicant has or was last granted limited leave  to  enter  or
    remain in the United Kingdom which was given in accordance with any  of
    the provisions of these Rules, other than where as  a  result  of  that
    leave he would not have been in the United Kingdom beyond 6 months from
    the date on which he  was  admitted  to  the  United  Kingdom  on  this
    occasion in accordance with these Rules, unless:


    (a) the leave in question is limited leave to  enter  as  a  fianc�  or
    proposed civil partner; or


    (b) the leave in question was granted to the applicant as  the  spouse,
    civil partner, unmarried or same-sex partner of a Relevant Points Based
    System Migrant (excluding a Tier 5  (Temporary  Worker)  other  than  a
    private servant in a diplomatic household who applied to enter  the  UK
    before 6 April 2012 or a Tier 4 (General) Student) and that  spouse  or
    partner is the same  person  in  relation  to  whom  the  applicant  is
    applying for an extension of stay under this rule; and


    (ii) the applicant is married to or  the  civil  partner  of  a  person
   present and settled in the United Kingdom; and


    (iii) the parties to the marriage or civil partnership have met; and


    (iv) the applicant has not remained in breach of the immigration  laws,
    disregarding any period of overstaying for a period of 28 days or less;
    and


    (v) the marriage or civil partnership  has  not  taken  place  after  a
    decision has  been  made  to  deport  the  applicant  or  he  has  been
    recommended for deportation or been given notice under Section 6(2)  of
    the Immigration Act 1971 or been given directions for his removal under
    section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; and


    (vi) each of the parties intends to live permanently with the other  as
    his  or  her  spouse  or  civil  partner  and  the  marriage  or  civil
    partnership is subsisting; and


    (vii) there will be adequate accommodation  for  the  parties  and  any
    dependants without recourse to public funds in accommodation which they
    own or occupy exclusively; and


    (viii) the  parties  will  be  able  to  maintain  themselves  and  any
    dependants adequately without recourse to public funds; and


    (ix)(a) the  applicant  provides  an  original  English  language  test
    certificate in speaking and listening from  an  English  language  test
    provider approved by the Secretary of State for these  purposes,  which
    clearly shows the  applicant's  name  and  the  qualification  obtained
    (which must meet or exceed level A1 of the Common European Framework of
    Reference) unless:


    (i) the applicant is  aged  65  or  over  at  the  time  he  makes  his
   application; or


    (ii) the applicant has  a  physical  or  mental  condition  that  would
    prevent him from meeting the requirement; or;


    (iii) there are  exceptional  compassionate  circumstances  that  would
    prevent the applicant from meeting the requirement; or


    (ix)(b) the applicant is a national of one of the following  countries:
    Antigua and Barbuda; Australia; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize;  Canada;
    Dominica; Grenada; Guyana; Jamaica; New Zealand; St Kitts and Nevis; St
    Lucia; St Vincent and  the  Grenadines;  Trinidad  and  Tobago;  United
    States of America; or


    (ix)(c) the applicant has obtained an  academic  qualification  (not  a
    professional or vocational qualification), which is deemed by UK  NARIC
    to meet the recognised standard of a Bachelor's or Master's  degree  or
    PhD in the  UK,  from  an  educational  establishment  in  one  of  the
    following countries:  Antigua  and  Barbuda;  Australia;  The  Bahamas;
    Barbados; Belize; Dominica;  Grenada;  Guyana;  Ireland;  Jamaica;  New
    Zealand; St Kitts and Nevis; St Lucia; St Vincent and  The  Grenadines;
    Trinidad and Tobago; the  UK;  the  USA;  and  provides  the  specified
    documents; or


    (ix)(d) the applicant has obtained an  academic  qualification  (not  a
    professional or vocational qualification) which is deemed by  UK  NARIC
    to meet the recognised standard of a Bachelor's or Master's  degree  or
    PhD in the UK, and


    (1) provides the specified evidence to show he has  the  qualification,
   and


    (2) UK NARIC  has  confirmed  that  the  qualification  was  taught  or
    researched in English, or


    (ix)(e) has obtained an academic qualification (not a  professional  or
    vocational qualification) which is deemed  by  UK  NARIC  to  meet  the
    recognised standard of a Bachelor's or Master's degree or  PhD  in  the
    UK, and provides the specified evidence to show:


    (1) he has the qualification, and


    (2) that the qualification was taught or researched in English."


17. I find that there is no material difference  between  the  non-switching
   provisions of paragraph 284 and E-LTRP.2.1. It  has  not  been  suggested
   that they were brought into force for different policy reasons. I  cannot
   see how the appellant who submitted an application on the basis  that  he
   was bound by the non-switching requirements of paragraph 284 can be heard
   to complain that he was not bound by the  non-switching  requirements  of
   paragraph E-LTRP.2.1. There is no indication in the application that  the
   appellant sought to argue that any of the non-switching requirements were
   invalid.


18. Ms Naik's  submissions  in  relation  to  the  invalidity  of  the  non-
   switching requirements have evolved and  developed  considerably  between
   those put to the FTTJ and  those  before  me.  In  paragraph  12  of  the
   determination the FTTJ records that; "it  was  accepted  by  counsel  (Ms
   Naik)  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
   Immigration Rules under, particularly, paragraph 281 because he  did  not
   have entry clearance and was not entitled to switch categories  while  in
   the UK." I suspect that the reference to paragraph 281 should have been a
   reference to paragraph 284. On the other hand, in paragraph 13, the  FTTJ
   records Ms Naik's suggestion that there was no justification put  forward
   for the non-switching policy "which would  adversely  affect  the  family
   life which the appellant and his wife had enjoyed since their marriage on
   20 March 2012. She said that the  respondent  had  not  put  forward  any
   "sensible  reason"  for  enforcing  that  policy  in  respect   of   this
   appellant." I have not been told and I cannot find any reason why the non-
   switching provisions would be acceptable in relation to the  requirements
   of the Immigration Rules in one context but not the other.


19. I have also studied the skeleton argument which  Ms  Naik  submitted  to
   the FTTJ. Whilst there is reference to and quotations from Zhang there is
   no clear submission that the non-switching provisions should  be  treated
   as invalid. The thrust of the submission as  I  read  it  is  that  Zhang
   support the proposition that the appellant  should  not  be  required  to
   return to Pakistan in order to make an  application  for  settlement  and
   entry clearance from there.


20. I must assess the way in which the FTTJ  dealt  with  the  grounds,  the
   skeleton and the oral submissions in the light of those that were  before
   him rather than the substantially different arguments  contained  in  the
   grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the skeleton argument before  me
   and Ms Naik's submissions. I find that the FTTJ properly dealt  with  the
   issues as they were put to him. He did not decide the appeal on the basis
   of the appellant's wife remaining here whilst the appellant  returned  to
   Pakistan in order to make an entry clearance application but on the basis
   that it would be reasonable to expect  the  appellant  and  his  wife  to
   continue their family life together  in  Pakistan.  Furthermore,  if  the
   appellant had advanced before the FTTJ the submissions  which  have  been
   made to me I would  have  concluded  that,  even  if  the  appellant  had
   succeeded in an argument that  the  non-switching  provisions  should  be
   removed from paragraph 284, he had  not  shown  that  he  met  the  other
   requirements of that paragraph. In that event, even if the FTTJ had  been
   persuaded that the non-switching requirements should have  been  excluded
   from the provisions of Appendix FM this would have made no difference  to
   a proper consideration of the Article  8  grounds  under  the  Strasbourg
   jurisprudence and in particular the conclusion that it was reasonable  to
   expect the husband-and-wife to  go  and  live  together  in  Pakistan.  I
   conclude that in the relation to the non-switching arguments the FTTJ did
   not err in law.


21. I find that the second ground of appeal disclose is  no  material  error
   of law. The FTTJ took into account the fact that the appellant  was  here
   legally. Nowhere did the FTTJ suggest  that  he  had  a  bad  immigration
   history. The immigration history is set out in paragraph 6 and  there  is
   no indication that the FTTJ failed to  take  this  into  account  in  his
   findings and conclusions. Similarly, the  FTTJ  records  the  appellant's
   wife's British citizenship in paragraph 6. In  paragraph  19,  under  the
   heading of "findings and conclusions" the FTTJ takes  into  account  that
   the wife is a British citizen who has lived all her life in the UK. It is
   not clear what difficulties may arise because "the appellant's wife  does
   not speak, read or write Urdu, and that she does not write  Punjabi".  It
   is not said that she does not speak Punjabi and I note  that  before  the
   FTTJ the appellant gave evidence through a Punjabi speaking  interpreter.
   I can find no-fault with the FTTJ's treatment of the evidence relating to
   the appellant's wife's circumstances in this country as opposed to  those
   which she would encounter in  Pakistan  including  a  comparison  of  the
   levels of social and familial support in both countries. Ms Naik conceded
   that the letters from the Department of Work and Pensions made  available
   at the hearing before me were not before the FTTJ. In any event  it  must
   be self evident that benefits payable in this country such as  Disability
   Living Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance will not be paid to
   the appellant's wife in Pakistan.


22. In paragraph 15 of the determination the FTTJ said;  "although  I  heard
   evidence from both the appellant and from his wife's sister, there is  no
   expert or other technical evidence presented to identify the difficulties
   and their consequences." In paragraph 16;  "the  absence  of  any  expert
   evidence about the wife's learning difficulties makes it  very  difficult
   to assess whether the problems identified by the appellant, which will be
   faced by all residents in Pakistan, are of  such  seriousness  that  they
   might properly be regarded as "insurmountable" for the appellant and  his
   wife" and "because of the generalised nature of the  problems  identified
   and without any expert evidence to show that the appellant's  wife  would
   find  very  particular  difficulty  in  adapting,  I  conclude  that  the
   appellant has not shown that there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  his
   family life continuing in Pakistan." I note that this point the  FTTJ  is
   considering; insurmountable obstacles", later he goes on to  address  the
   reasonableness of expecting the family life to be continued in  Pakistan.
   I find that the FTTJ was not saying that  corroborative  expert  evidence
   was a legal requirement; only that he did not have  medical  evidence  in
   circumstances where it would have been helpful. Whilst the evidence  from
   the appellant's wife's sister was not disputed  it  was  not  independent
   medical evidence. There are differences of emphasis between what she said
   and the written submissions. Her witness statement before the FTTJ  dated
   21 September 2013 stated, at paragraph 4 that her sister "suffers from  a
   mild learning disability and also has a speech impediment."  The  grounds
   of appeal state, at paragraph 22 that the levels of benefits paid to  the
   appellant's wife are those received by the most severely disabled.


23. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction but  in  the  light
   of the evidence about the  appellant's  wife's  learning  difficulties  I
   consider it appropriate to do so. I make an order under rule  14  of  the
   Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure
   or publication of any matter likely to lead  members  of  the  public  to
   identify the appellant, his wife, or any member of their families.

24. I find that the FTTJ did not err in law and I uphold his determination.
