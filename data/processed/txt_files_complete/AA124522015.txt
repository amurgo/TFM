                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION not made)

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance by or on behalf of the appellant
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW


1.   The appellant is a national of Cï¿½te d'Ivoire, born on 1st August  2002,
    who travelled via  Brussels  to  the  United  Kingdom  and  entered  at
    Heathrow on 6th January 2015.  He travelled on a  business  visa  which
    expired on 15th January 2015, and two days before expiry on 13th  March
    2015, he made an asylum claim.  His claim was refused by the  Secretary
    of State on 10th September  2015,  and,  as  a  result,  the  appellant
    appealed.

2.   He first appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  at  a  hearing  on  11th
    March 2006, when First-tier Tribunal Judge  Mayall  heard  his  appeal.
    His determination was subsequently set aside by Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Macdonald on 4th August 2016, because of a failure by  the  First
    Tier Tribunal Judge to consider medical and corroborative evidence  and
    the matter was remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be  heard  afresh
    with none of the findings of Judge Mayall preserved.

3.   The appeal came for hearing before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Plumptre
    on 3rd March 2017, and again on  25th  May  2017.   She  dismissed  the
    appeal on asylum grounds, on humanitarian  protection  grounds  and  on
    human rights grounds.  Unfortunately, there  was  before  the  judge  a
    medical report in respect of the appellant.  It was a report dated 26th
    January 2016, by Dr Lechi and it was in the appellant's  bundle  A4  on
    page 16.  It would have been helpful if the appellant's representatives
    had submitted one complete comprehensive bundle  properly  indexed  and
    paginated, but nonetheless, the evidence was before the judge  and  the
    judge has materially erred in law by failing to  demonstrate  that  she
    considered it.

4.   This morning, Mr Walker, on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    accepted that this  is  a  clear  error  of  law.   I  have  considered
    retaining the appeal in the Upper Tribunal for a hearing by himself  or
    one of my Upper Tribunal colleagues, but given the lengthy  delay  that
    is likely to ensue if I do, I have concluded, and Mr Walker has  agreed
    with me that the matter  must  be  remitted  again  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be heard afresh.

5.   I set aside the determination  in  its  entirety  and  direct  that  it
    should be reheard afresh by a  judge  other  than  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Mayall or Judge Plumptre, who I believe has now retired.   Three
    hours should be allowed for  the  hearing  of  the  appeal.   A  French
    interpreter will be required for the hearing.
