Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Erum Wahid, Counsel instructed by Universal
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms Alex Everett, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against refusal of an EEA  extended
    family member residence card, for lack of jurisdiction.  The  appellant
    is a citizen of Bangladesh.

 2. The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  based  on  the  Upper
    Tribunal's decision in Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal  :  Albania)  [2016]
    UKUT 411 (IAC) that there was no right  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for extended family members under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (as amended).

 3. The Court of  Appeal  in  Khan  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department & Anor [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 held that  the  Upper  Tribunal
    erred in so finding and that an extended family member has a  right  of
    appeal.  The Supreme Court in SM (Algeria) v Entry  Clearance  Officer,
    UK  Visa  Section  [2018]   UKSC   9   at   [37]-[38]   approved   that
    interpretation.

 4. It follows that the decision in this appeal must be set aside  and  the
    appellant should have the benefit of a full First-tier Tribunal hearing
    on the merits. A Bengali interpreter will be required.

DECISION

 5. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  The decision in this appeal will be
    remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.
