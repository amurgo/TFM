For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge North sitting at Bennett House on 28  August
    2015) dismissing his appeal against the decision of an Entry  Clearance
    Officer to refuse him entry clearance as the spouse of a person present
    and settled here for non-compliance with  the  financial  requirements.
    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do
    not  consider  that  the  appellant  requires   anonymity   for   these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Page  granted  the  appellant  permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons:

         "2.  The permission to appeal application complains that the  judge
             was in error in stating that the appellant's sponsor, as proof
             of her self-employment  income,  had  failed  to  provide  her
             annual accounts, twelve months' bank statements and  proof  of
             registration  with  HMRC  as  a  self-employed  person.    The
             appellant states that all of these documents were provided  by
             the  appellant  in  support  of  his  application  for   entry
             clearance.  At paragraph 8  of  the  decision  the  judge  has
             stated the sponsor did not provide proof of registration  with
             HMRC as a self-employed  person  and  went  on  to  find  that
             because the  appellant  had  not  submitted  the  prerequisite
             documents, the Immigration Rules  had  not  been  met  by  the
             appellant.  I remind myself that it is not my function at  the
             permission to appeal stage to make findings on the  merits  of
             the appellant's application.  The appellant claims that he did
             meet the annual income threshold of �18,600 and that this  had
             been  demonstrated  by  the  submission  of  the  prerequisite
             documentation to meet the requirements of the Rules.  This  is
             obviously an issue  that  has  to  be  considered  further  so
             permission to appeal is granted. "

Relevant Background

 3. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, whose date of birth is 22 July
    1985.  He applied for entry clearance on 3 October 2014.   The  refusal
    of entry clearance is undated, and  it  is  apparent  from  surrounding
    documents that the appellant received the  notice  of  decision  on  20
    January 2015.

 4. According to the notice of  decision,  in  Part  3A  of  the  form  the
    appellant stated that the sponsor had been employed  by  Gap  Personnel
    Holding Limited since September 2013, and was earning an  annual  gross
    income before tax of �6,087.  The Entry Clearance Officer set  out  the
    documents that were required to prove  salaried  employment,  and  said
    that the appellant had provided the necessary documents to evidence the
    sponsor's declared income from employment with  Gap  Personnel  Holding
    Limited.

 5. In Part C of the Appendix C form, he had stated his  sponsor  was  also
    self-employed as a sewing machinist, and had earned �8,835  from  self-
    employment in the last financial year.

 6. The Entry Clearance Officer went on to list the  documents  which  were
    required under the Rules.  He had not provided  proof  of  registration
    with HMRC as self-employed; or monthly personal bank statements for the
    same twelve month period as the tax return showing that the income from
    self-employment had been paid into an account in the name of the person
    or the name of the person and their  partner  jointly;  or  her  latest
    annual audited or unaudited accounts with the name  of  the  accountant
    clearly shown; and the accountant must be a  member  of  an  accredited
    accounting body specified in paragraph 19(g)(ii) of Appendix A  of  the
    Rules.

 7. Accordingly, he  was  refusing  the  application  under  paragraph  EC-
    P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The appellant was not legally represented before  Judge  North.   There
    was an appearance by a  Presenting  Officer  on  behalf  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer.  The sponsor attended the  hearing,  and  gave  oral
    evidence.  She also made submissions on the appellant's behalf.

 9. In his subsequent decision, the judge observed at  paragraph  [7]  that
    there were problems  with  the  sponsor's  claimed  income  from  self-
    employment.  Taking the two sources of income together, the sponsor did
    not reach the required income threshold of �18,600 per annum.

10. There were also additional  problems  concerning  her  self-employment.
    She had not produced the required documentation as set out in the Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision.  Whilst it was accepted  the  tax  demand
    issued to the sponsor by HMRC mentioned  income  from  self-employment,
    that document did not meet the requirement to produce the original copy
    of the initial registration document.

11. The judge said that at the hearing the sponsor had  produced  a  bundle
    which included her bank statements for the year 2015.   He  said  these
    could not be taken into account as the date of  the  decision  appealed
    against was 13 January 2015.  Her oral  evidence  was  that  her  self-
    employment took the form of bespoke sewing for individual clients,  and
    that she had not kept accounts other than notes in her own diary.   The
    judge found that therefore she could not have satisfied the requirement
    to produce her latest audited or unaudited accounts.

12. The judge dismissed the appeal under the Rules, and at  paragraph  [11]
    he gave his reasons for dismissing an alternative claim under Article 8
    ECHR.  She gave evidence that she and  her  2  year  old  daughter  had
    visited the appellant in Pakistan, and that they kept in touch daily by
    telephone and electronic means.  She acknowledged that if  she  was  to
    organise her documentary evidence she could now  lodge  a  satisfactory
    application supported by the required evidence to show that  the  Rules
    could now be met.  In the circumstances,  he  was  satisfied  that  the
    appellant could not succeed  under  Article  8.   The  ability  of  the
    parties to maintain contact with  each  other  and  to  lodge  a  fresh
    application satisfying the Immigration Rules  satisfied  him  that  the
    ECO's decision was proportionate to the legitimate aim  of  immigration
    control.





The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

13. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, I reviewed the documents  that  had  been  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal with Mr McVeety's assistance.  I also heard from the  sponsor.



Discussion

14. The appellant and the sponsor clearly had legal assistance in  drafting
    the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

15. Ground 1 asserts that the judge miscalculated  the  sponsor's  earnings
    from her employment with Gap Personnel Holding Limited.  In support  of
    the application, the appellant had provided a  sponsorship  declaration
    which expressly stated that the sum of �6,087 represented the sponsor's
    income from employment for a period of six months from 14 March 2014 to
    5 September 2014.  This amount was  commensurate  with  a  run  of  six
    months' wage slips provided by the sponsor.  It did not  establish  her
    annual income from employment, which would have been  twice  the  above
    figure.

16. I  did  not  have  a  copy  of  the  application  form  or  sponsorship
    declaration in my file, and nor did Mr McVeety.  However, I was able to
    establish from other documents, including a P60 for the tax year ending
    April 2015, that there  was  potential  merit  in  this  error  of  law
    challenge.

17. I accept that the sponsor earned the figure stated  in  the  six  month
    period to 5 September 2014, and that over  the  entire  financial  year
    ending in April 2015 she  earned  just  over  �12,000  gross  from  her
    employment.  In so far as it is material, the sponsor's  earnings  were
    considerably less in the period from September 2013 to April 2014.   In
    that period, her total earnings were less than �3,000.

18. The source of the confusion may  be  the  employment  letter  dated  22
    January 2015 issued by Adam Millward of Gap Personnel.  In this letter,
    he said that the sponsor had commenced employment on 23 September  2013
    on a temporary contract.  On 31 December 2013 she  signed  a  permanent
    Gap Personnel contract which offered her work on an ongoing basis.  She
    worked anything up to 39.5 hours per week at a pay rate of �7 per hour.



19. What this letter does not do is to specify the sponsor's  gross  annual
    salary, or the period over which she has been or was paid the level  of
    salary relied upon in the application.

20. Accordingly, although the Entry Clearance Officer stated in the refusal
    notice that the appellant  had  provided  the  necessary  documents  to
    evidence an annual gross income before tax of �6,087, I do not consider
    that the Entry Clearance Officer can be held to  this  concession  with
    respect to an asserted annual gross income before tax of  �6,087  x  2.
    In short, while I accept on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    sponsor was in fact earning a gross annual income of  over  �12,000  at
    the date of application and/or decision, she has  not  shown  that  the
    judge erred in law in treating her  as  only  having  an  annual  gross
    income before tax  from  her  employment  with  Gap  Personnel  Holding
    Limited of �6,087.

21. But even if I am wrong about that, no error  of  law  is  made  out  in
    respect of the judge's finding  on  the  sponsor's  income  from  self-
    employment.  I am satisfied that the appellant did not provide all  the
    required documents to show that the sponsor had earned �8,835 from self-
    employment.  I asked the sponsor about her  bank  statements,  and  she
    agreed that it was not possible to ascertain from the  bank  statements
    which cash deposits relate to income from self-employment.

22. The  sponsor  did  not  provide  an  original  certified  copy  of  the
    registration documentation issued by HMRC, which is the  required  form
    of proof of registration with  HMRC  as  self-employed.   Although  the
    sponsor provided a set of accounts, it is not shown that the accountant
    is a member of an accredited accounting  body  specified  in  paragraph
    19(g)(ii) of Appendix A of the Rules.

23. It is arguable that the Entry Clearance Officer should  have  exercised
    evidential flexibility with respect to the registration document, as it
    is apparent from other documents provided with the application that the
    sponsor must be registered with HMRC as self-employed. But in the light
    of the sponsor's oral evidence about her accounting procedures, the non-
    compliance with the other evidential  requirements  cannot  lightly  be
    brushed away.  Accordingly, the judge has given  adequate  reasons  for
    finding that claimed earnings from self-employment cannot be taken into
    account.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
