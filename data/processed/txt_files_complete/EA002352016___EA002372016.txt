Solicitors.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. In the First-tier Tribunal, this appeal was  heard  together  with  the
    appeal of a Ms Mehro Javed, the appellant's wife (EA/00237/2016).  Both
    were then represented by Western Solicitors. Mr M Murphy,  of  Counsel,
    appeared for them both at a hearing on 25 April 2017  before  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Devittie (hereafter the judge unless  otherwise
    stated). The judge dismissed the appeals.

 2. Following the grant of permission by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P
    J M Hollingworth, both appeals were listed for  hearing  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal before Upper Tribunal Judge Gill on 31  January  2018.  Mr  S.
    Bellara appeared for both the appellant  and  (so  Mr  Bellara  thought
    before the hearing commenced) for Ms Javed. That hearing was  adjourned
    because Mr Bellara was surprised by the fact that Ms Javed had  written
    to the Upper Tribunal by letter dated 26 January 2018 (a copy of  which
    Mr Bellara saw for the first time at the hearing on  31  January  2018)
    stating that she  was  separated  from  the  appellant  and  no  longer
    supported his appeal. Mr Bellara said that he had not been informed  of
    the separation by the appellant who attended the hearing on 31  January
    2018 and that Western Solicitors had  not  received  any  communication
    from Ms Javed to that effect. Upper Tribunal Judge Gill  adjourned  the
    hearing on 31 January 2018. The Upper Tribunal's reasons for adjourning
    the hearing on 31  January  2018  for  both  appeals  are  set  out  in
    Directions dated 31 January 2018.

 3. Both appeals were listed for hearing today. We record that  Mr  Bellara
    appeared for the appellant and confirmed that he was not instructed  to
    represent Ms Javed. A Mr A.Nasir of Western Solicitors  also  attended.
    He confirmed that Ms Javed had withdrawn her instructions from  Western
    Solicitors.

 4. We therefore proceeded to  deal  with  Ms  Javed's  appeal  separately.
    Nevertheless, we have recorded the above in this decision so that it is
    clear why this appeal was heard together with the appeal of Ms Javed in
    the First-tier Tribunal with one combined decision promulgated  by  the
    judge on 17 May 2017 and why the two appeals are now being  decided  by
    the Upper Tribunal in separate decisions.

 5. As will be seen, the issue in the appellant's  appeal  is  whether  his
    marriage to Ms Javed is a marriage of convenience.  The  fact  that  Ms
    Javed says that they are separated does not mean that the marriage  was
    a marriage of convenience at its inception. In  any  event,  the  issue
    before us is whether  the  judge  had  materially  erred  in  law.  The
    evidence of separation post-dates the judge's decision and we therefore
    do not  take  it  into  account  in  deciding  whether  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law in reaching his finding that the marriage was a
    marriage of convenience.

Background facts

 6. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 28 September 1986.  Ms
    Javed is a national of Italy, born on 10 October  1992.  The  appellant
    arrived in the United Kingdom with a Tier  4  student  visa  which  was
    valid from 6 June 2010 until 29 November 2011. He was  granted  further
    leave in January 2012 which was valid until 27  November  2012.  On  25
    November 2012 he applied for further student leave, which  was  refused
    on 17 June  2013.  He  appealed  this  decision,  but  his  appeal  was
    dismissed by the Tribunal on 11 December 2013. His appeal rights became
    exhausted on 29 January 2014. He did not leave the United Kingdom after
    his application was refused.

 7. On 9 January 2015, the appellant submitted an application  for  an  EEA
    residence card as the unmarried partner of Ms  Javed.  The  application
    was refused on 14 May  2015  as  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to
    confirm that he and Ms  Javed  were  in  a  durable  relationship.  The
    appellant appealed against this decision but the appeal was struck  out
    on 7 July 2015.

 8. On 29 April 2015, the appellant and Ms Javed married in Scotland. On  8
    July  2015,  Ms  Javed  applied  for  a  registration  certificate   as
    confirmation of a right to reside in the United Kingdom.  On  the  same
    date, the appellant submitted an application for a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of a right to reside in the United Kingdom as  the  spouse
    of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

 9. On 18 December 2015,  the  respondent  refused  both  applications,  in
    separate notices. These were the decisions that were the subject of the
    appeals before the judge. The appeal before us in the instant  case  is
    the appellant's appeal against the  judge's  decision  to  dismiss  his
    appeal against the respondent's decision of 18  December  2015  in  his
    case. The judge's decision was promulgated on 17 May 2017  following  a
    hearing on 25 April 2017.

10. Reasons for each decision were given in two separate  refusal  letters.
    In essence, the respondent concluded  that  the  marriage  between  the
    appellant and Ms Javed was a sham marriage. The decisions followed  two
    visits made by immigration officers to the address where the  appellant
    and Ms Javed claimed to be living. The first visit was made on 22 April
    2015 (that is, before the marriage in Scotland took place on  29  April
    2015) and the second visit on 11 December 2015. We shall refer  to  the
    report following the first visit as the "first report" and  the  report
    following the second visit as the "second report".


The judge's decision

11. The judge had before him a large bundle of documents, including witness
    statements from several witnesses. The judge also heard  oral  evidence
    from a number of witnesses. Besides the appellant and Ms  Javed,  there
    were ten live witnesses. They included Ms Javed's mother, two  men  who
    were Ms Javed's brothers, the appellant's uncle and another relative of
    the appellant.

12. Having set out the respondent's case and provided a detailed summary of
    the appellant's written and oral evidence as well as the evidence of Ms
    Javed, her mother, her  brothers,  the  appellant's  uncle,  his  other
    relative and the remaining witnesses, the  judge  set  out  a  detailed
    extract of the first report, as follows:


        "Upon arriving at the address at ......officer  Hale  proceeded  to
        knock on the door which was answered by a female  I  recognised  as
        ...Javed Mehro. I explained to her why officers  were  present  and
        she granted entry via informed consent signing my  pocket  notebook
        to this effect.


        Javed Mehro invited the officers into a three  bed  semi  that  was
        occupied by her immediate family; both her parents were present.  I
        asked if she could take me to her room and I was led  to  a  larger
        rear facing first floor bedroom with two single beds and  a  double
        mattress laid out on the floor. Occupying the two large single beds
        were her two younger brothers aged 21 and 17. No other persons were
        present in the room. She claimed that some  of  the  rooms  in  the
        house were not habitable due to mould.


        Javed went on to claim that [sic] appellant was not present because
        he had been at a party in Harrow the previous night but was  unable
        to give the address he attended. She then showed me items  of  mail
        clothing within a wardrobe  but  as  both  her  brothers  also  had
        clothes and cosmetic items  within  the  room  this  proved  to  be
        inconclusive. Mhero  Javed  then  stated  that  the  numerous  male
        cosmetic items within the room belonged to her brothers and claimed
        that appellant's cosmetic products were in the bathroom; I was then
        shown one tube of unidentified cream.


        Javed Mhero stated that she worked for  Primark  and  showed  me  a
        monthly wage slip for �460. She stated that  her  father  paid  the
        rent on the house at �1700 per month. I asked if she could show  me
        paperwork including College certificates  for  the  appellant.  She
        claimed that all of his certificates were at a friends [sic]  house
        but that she did not know the address. I was then shown two letters
        from Barclays dated 2 March 2015 and 16  March  2015  showing  that
        appellant had opened a bank account linked to  the  address.  There
        was also a letter from Lloyds bank showing the  joint  account  had
        been set up in Javed's and Subhani's names. There was  no  date  on
        the letter and she claimed not to know when [sic] account had  been
        set up. She could show me no statements attributed to this account.


        At this point I went with Javed back into the room she shared  with
        her two brothers. She had previously stated that  the  wardrobe  in
        the room contained  [sic]  appellant's  clothing  but  upon  closer
        inspection it transpired that the wallet and  the  trainers  within
        the wardrobe belonged to her older brother which was  confirmed  by
        Javed Mehro.


        At this point Javed proffered her mobile phone to I/O Hale to check
        for evidence of a subsisting  relationship.  I/O  Hale  noted  that
        there were some photos of the  male  that  Javed  claimed  was  the
        appellant. I/O Hale asked about some of these items that  appellant
        was wearing including a denim shirt, jacket,  blue  shirt  and  two
        suits. Javed could produce none of the items of clothing.


        Javed claimed to have been in a  relationship  with  the  appellant
        since meeting him at a  birthday  party  of  a  work  colleague  in
        Greenford. She claimed that she had got engaged on 21 February 2015
        and that they subsequently had a party to celebrate  this  although
        she was not wearing a ring at the time of the visit. It  was  noted
        that the very first photos on her  phone  were  of  the  engagement
        party; she claimed that her previous  phone  had  been  damaged  in
        response to officers asking about photos of the couple  before  the
        claimed engagement party.


        I put it to Javed that it did not appear that the  appellant  lived
        at the property and asked her  where  he  actually  did  live.  She
        replied that he did not live there. It is my opinion based  on  the
        above  information  that  on  the  balance   of   probabilities   [
                         ] is not the claimed address of  Javed  Mehro  and
        Zaka Subhani .This would appear to cast doubt on  the  veracity  of
        the  claimed  relationship  between  and  the   sponsor   and   the
        appellant."

13. The judge then considered the matters that arose from the first report,
    at paras 12(a)-(i) on pages 7-9 of  his  decision.  He  considered  the
    credibility of the evidence  of  the  appellant,  Ms  Javed  and  other
    witnesses as he went  along.  Paras  12(a)-(i)  may  be  summarised  as
    follows:

    (a)     The judge took into account the assertion in the first  report,
        which he noted was  not  disputed,  that  Ms  Javed's  two  younger
        brothers were occupying the two single beds in the room  which  was
        said to be the bedroom of the appellant and Ms Javed. He took  into
        account the explanation that  the  reason  why  the  brothers  were
        occupying the single beds was that there was dampness in the  other
        rooms.

      (b)   He took into account the assertion in the  first  report,  which
        he noted was  not  disputed,  that  Ms  Javed  had  said  that  the
        appellant was not present because  he  was  attending  a  party  in
        Harrow.

      (c)   He took into account the assertion in the  first  report,  which
        he noted was not disputed, that Ms Javed was  unable  to  give  the
        address  of  where  the  appellant  had  attended  the  party.   He
        considered that, in any event, Ms Javed did not  know  the  address
        because in her oral evidence she gave the name of  the  appellant's
        friend at whose residence he had spent the night but  she  did  not
        appear to have any more information about him.

      (d)   He took into account the assertion in the  first  report,  which
        he considered was consistent with the evidence of the appellant and
        Ms Javed that the bedroom shown to the immigration officers  by  Ms
        Javed as the one she claimed she shared with the appellant had male
        clothing which could have belonged to her brothers.

      (e)   He took into account the assertion in the  first  report,  which
        he noted was not challenged, that Ms Javed did not have any of  the
        appellant's college certificates and that she  had  said  that  the
        documents were at the appellant's  friend's  house.  He  took  into
        account the  appellant's  oral  evidence  on  this  aspect  of  the
        evidence, stating: "... the appellant has  at  this  hearing,  when
        faced with difficulties  in  cross  examination  as  to  where  his
        possessions were on the day, suggested that he  had  left  some  of
        them at his friend's house as it was his habit to  sleep  overnight
        at the houses of various friends", evidence which it is  clear  the
        judge did not find credible.

      (e)   He took into account the fact that the first report stated  that
        "upon close inspection of the room which [Ms Javed] claimed she was
        sharing with the appellant, it was clear that none of his  clothing
        was in that room. Nor were there any other items belonging  to  him
        that could be identified". He noted that this aspect of the  report
        was not challenged in evidence at this hearing and he said that  he
        found that it was probably true.

      (f)   He noted that the first report states that Ms Javed  showed  the
        immigration officer  her  mobile  phone  with  photographs  of  the
        appellant but that, when asked  to  produce  the  very  distinctive
        clothing he was wearing in the photographs, she was  unable  to  do
        so. He considered that this aspect of the report was probably  true
        and, furthermore, he noted that this evidence was not challenged by
        the appellant and Ms Javed.

      (g)   He noted that Ms Javed has not challenged the assertions in  the
        first report that she was asked to produce evidence on  her  mobile
        phone of her relationship with the appellant prior to the  date  of
        her claimed engagement and that her response  was  that  the  phone
        which contained such  evidence  had  been  damaged  and  hence  the
        evidence was not retrievable.  He  noted  that  Ms  Javed  did  not
        challenge this version when it was put to her in cross examination.

      (h)   He took into account the fact that the first report states  that
        Ms Javed accepted that, despite claiming to have been engaged,  she
        did not wear any ring on the date of the visit. He  considered  her
        explanation that she feared that her ring would be damaged  if  she
        wore it. However, he also noted that, when the  same  question  was
        put to her mother, she suggested that her daughter suffered from an
        allergy which brought about stiffness in her finger and  hence  her
        tendency was not to wear the ring at night.

      (i)   He noted that the first report states that,  at  the  conclusion
        of his visit, the immigration officer put it to Ms Javed  that  the
        appellant was not in fact living  on  the  premises  and  that  the
        immigration officer recorded that she had accepted  that  this  was
        so.

      (j)   The judge then said (at para 12(i)):

                 "I have no doubt in accepting that  in  the  light  of  the
             conspicuous lack of evidence shown to  the  officer  to  prove
             that the appellant was residing at the premises, it would have
             been logical for him to put such a question to [Ms  Javed].  I
             find it highly  probable  that  [Ms  Javed]  would  have  been
             constrained to admit that it indeed  was  the  case  that  the
             appellant was not living at the premises. All of the [sic]  of
             the report is not contentious and is accepted  by  [Ms  Javed]
             and the appellant; in these circumstances I struggle to find a
             reason why the immigration officer would have fabricated  this
             one response to a question which logic dictated he should  put
             to [Ms Javed]."

14. The judge then considered the second report. He  noted  that  the  main
    thrust of the second report concerned the fact that the side of the bed
    where Ms Javed claimed to have been sleeping before the visit was  cold
    upon being checked by the officers whereas the bed in a single room was
    warm even though Ms Javed's family claimed that no  one  had  slept  in
    that bed on the night in question.

15. The judge dealt with the second report briefly, at para 13, stating  as
    follows:

            "I have considered the contents of  the  report  of  the  second
             visit in December 2015. It's [sic] main thrust  appears  to  be
             that the warmth of the bed or lack of warmth on the one side of
             the bed where the appellant and the  sponsor  claimed  to  have
             been  sleeping  at  the  time  of  the  visit,  raises  serious
             questions as to whether they were indeed sleeping  together.  I
             am reluctant to rely on this report support in my assessment of
             the issues in this case, not least  because  the  officers  who
             made these findings were not  cross-examined  and  indeed,  the
             appellant  and  the  sponsor  have  challenged   the   evidence
             regarding the warmth of the one side of the bed and the lack of
             warmth on the  other  side  of  the  bed  in  which  there  was
             sleeping."

16. It is therefore clear from para 13 of  the  judge's  decision  that  he
    placed little or no weight on the second report. It is clear  from  the
    remainder of his  paras  12(a)-(i)  of  his  decision,  which  we  have
    summarised at our para 13 above, that he  placed  much  weight  on  the
    first report, stating, in addition, at para 15 as follows:

            "15. The contents of the first  report  in  my  opinion  clearly
                 establish that  the  appellant  was  not  residing  at  the
                 premises at the time of the visit. This  finding  seriously
                 undermines the claim that the  parties  are  in  a  genuine
                 marriage relationship. The report clearly  demonstrates  in
                 my view, that  [Ms  Javed]  was  unable  to  point  to  any
                 evidence of the  appellant  living  on  the  premises.  She
                 claimed she did not have her mobile  phone  to  demonstrate
                 communication between her  and  [sic]  appellant  prior  to
                 their engagement; she was unable to point to  any  clothing
                 items of the appellant during the visit; she accepted  that
                 he did not have any of  his  college  certificates  on  the
                 premises and sought to explain this by stating that he  had
                 left them at a friend's place."

17. The judge took into account the documentary evidence of the photographs
    (para 14). At para 14, he also said  that  he  took  into  account  the
    evidence of the several witnesses who gave evidence who  he  considered
    were  not  wholly  independent  witnesses,  in  that,  they  have  some
    relationship including friendship with the appellant and Ms  Javed.  He
    said that he would consider in the round the weight to  attach  to  the
    evidence of the witnesses and to the documentary evidence having regard
    to the totality of the evidence before him. At para 16,  he  said  that
    the evidence of the appellant and Ms Javed lacked credibility and  that
    they were poor witnesses.

18. At para 16 of his decision, the judge also said:

            "16. I observed the appellant and the sponsor give  evidence  at
                 this hearing. I find that their evidence lacked credibility
                 and they were poor witnesses. The most serious conflict  in
                 the evidence is that the appellant said that he was not  at
                 the house on the day of the  first  visit  because  he  had
                 attended the birthday party of a friend. He  said  that  he
                 did on frequent occasions  sleep  at  friend's  houses  and
                 hence, some of his clothes were at friend's houses and  not
                 at the premises he was living with  [Ms  Javed].  In  stark
                 contrast to this evidence, [Ms Javed's] mother  and  indeed
                 [Ms Javed], said that it was not his practice to  sleep  at
                 friend's houses overnight, and that the occasion  on  which
                 he did so when the officers  visited  was  the  first  such
                 instance  for  him  to  sleep   out.   This   conflict   is
                 fundamental. It goes to the very core  of  the  claim  that
                 this is a sham marriage.  The  appellant  was  not  at  the
                 premises where he claimed to be residing. He had not  slept
                 there. The explanation given as to his absence I find to be
                 entirely lacking in credibility."

19. In his concluding para 17, the judge said that:

            "17.  In  the  light  of  the  unsatisfactory  features  of  the
                 evidence of the appellant and [Ms  Javed],  I  attach  very
                 little weight to the supporting evidence that was  adduced,
                 including the evidence of the several witnesses,  the  bank
                 statements and the photographs. I  am  satisfied  that  the
                 respondent has established that the appellant's marriage to
                 [Ms Javed] is one of convenience."

The grounds and submissions

20.  There  were  four  grounds  before  Judge  Hollingworth  who   granted
    permission. It is not necessary to summarise the four  grounds  because
    Mr Bellara only pursued a single ground, which arose from grounds 2 and
    3 of the written grounds, i.e. that the judge erred in law  in  failing
    to assess the credibility of all of the witnesses, in  particular,  the
    evidence of the appellant's in-laws.

21. In particular, Mr Bellara submitted that the judge erred in failing  to
    assess, and make any findings upon, the evidence of Ms Javed's  father,
    a Mr Mohammed Javed (hereafter Mr Javed).

22. Mr Bellara drew our attention to the fact that Mr Javed  was  not  even
    mentioned by the judge. We were taken to Mr Javed's  witness  statement
    (pages 262-264 of the appellant's bundle) where he described the events
    that took place during the  second  visit,  on  11  December  2015.  He
    described, inter alia, the knock on the door; who  answered  the  door;
    when he first saw the immigration officers; that an officer went to the
    bedroom that he (Mr Javed) shared with his wife and said that  the  bed
    in that room was warm; that they then  went  to  Ms  Javed's  room  and
    touched the bed in that room; and that he was told by Ms Javed that the
    officers said that she had not  been  sleeping  with  her  husband.  He
    confirmed that the marriage between the  appellant  and  Ms  Javed  was
    genuine. He described how it came about that the appellant and Ms Javed
    had their  legal  marriage  on  29  April  2015  and  why  the  wedding
    celebrations in (according to his statement) February 2015 were rushed.



23. Mr Bellara placed particular reliance on para 16 of Mr Javed's  witness
    statement where he said:

            "16. I would like the court to consider that Mrs Mehro Javed  is
                 my only daughter. Me and my wife would never  allow  a  man
                 who is not married to our daughter to  be  sleeping  beside
                 her. No parent would put their daughter in that  situation.
                 If we were to allow this as  parents,  we  would  be  going
                 against the teachings of  our  religion  and  we  would  be
                 looked down upon by the community. In my culture, we  treat
                 the women in our  homes  with  respect,  we  would  not  be
                 protecting the honor and dignity of the woman by allowing a
                 man who she is not married to, to be laying next to her  in
                 our own  home.  I  believe  the  Home  Office  should  have
                 considered  this  before   reaching   such   negative   and
                 unsubstantiated conclusions."

24. Mr Bellara submitted that the evidence of Mr Javed was perhaps the most
    important. His witness statement was the most cogent  and  detailed  of
    the witness statements. Mr Bellara said that his instructions were that
    Mr Javed did give oral evidence. However, he could not  say  what  oral
    evidence he gave because he (Mr Bellara)  did  not  appear  before  the
    judge.

25. Mr Bellara submitted that the real point arising from the  evidence  of
    Mr Javed was  that  Mr  Javed  explained  that  he  had  conducted  the
    marriage. This was evidence that the judge  had  failed  to  take  into
    account.

26. However, given the fact that it was not in dispute that  the  appellant
    and Ms Javed were married, we asked Mr Bellara why  this  evidence  was
    material to the outcome. Mr Bellara submitted it was  material  because
    the main thrust of the second report concerned the warmth and  lack  of
    warmth in one or other bed. He submitted that Mr Javed's  evidence  was
    therefore important because he explained the layout of the  house  and,
    at para 16, that he would never allow his daughter to sleep with a  man
    if the marriage was not genuine.

27. Mr Bellara submitted that the Tribunal could not be satisfied that  the
    judge had taken into account the important evidence of Mr Javed.

28. In response, Mr Wilding submitted that  Mr  Javed's  evidence  was  not
    material because it only concerns the visit on 11 December  2015  which
    led to the second report. He submitted that it was clear that the judge
    had placed little or no reliance upon the  second  report.  Mr  Wilding
    submitted that para 16 of the witness statement of  Mr  Javed  was  not
    material either because the point that the respondent  was  making  was
    that the appellant and Ms Javed were not sleeping together.

29. Mr Wilding drew attention to the fact that there was no  evidence  from
    Counsel who had appeared for the appellant and Ms Javed at the  hearing
    before the judge to  confirm  what  evidence  Mr  Javed  gave  in  oral
    evidence. Counsel's notes of the hearing  had  not  been  produced.  Mr
    Wilding submitted,  at  our  request,  a  copy  of  the  notes  of  the
    Presenting Officer who appeared for the respondent before the judge, as
    we had difficulty deciphering the judge's  Record  of  Proceedings.  He
    submitted that it was clear that Mr Javed's oral  evidence  focused  on
    the allegation concerning warmth or otherwise of one or other bed.

30. Mr Wilding submitted that even if the evidence of Mr Javed, written and
    oral, had not been properly considered, it was not  capable  of  having
    any bearing on the outcome of the appellant's appeal. This was  because
    the judge attached much weight on the  first  report  and  because  the
    discrepancies relied upon by the judge,  which  arose  from  the  first
    report, were discrepancies between the evidence of the appellant and Ms
    Javed and from  what  Ms  Javed's  mother  had  said  which  the  judge
    mentioned at para 16 of his decision.

31. In response, Mr Bellara submitted  that  the  reason  why  the  witness
    statement of Mr Javed focused on the second report was that the refusal
    letter relies to a great degree on the  second  report  and  the  issue
    concerning the warmth or lack of warmth of one or other bed.  He  asked
    us to bear this in mind.

32. Mr Bellara drew our attention to the fact  that  the  judge  took  into
    account against the appellant the  timing  of  his  application  for  a
    residence card. At paras 4 and 5 of his statement, Mr  Javed  explained
    why the marriage took place when it  did,  i.e.  that  the  appellant's
    mother had been diagnosed with cancer and did not have long to live. He
    therefore submitted that there were question marks as  to  whether  all
    aspects of the witness statement of Mr Javed, including  para  16,  had
    been taken into account by the judge.

33. We reserved our decision.





Assessment

34. We will first deal with Mr Bellara's attempt  to  rely  upon  the  oral
    evidence of Mr Javed in  stating  that  he  could  not  say  what  oral
    evidence he had given. As we  said  at  the  hearing,  it  is  for  the
    appellant to show that the judge materially erred in law.  In  reaching
    our decision on this issue, we will not  enter  into  any  speculations
    about any oral evidence that any of the live witnesses may  have  given
    or decide the appeal on the basis of speculative assumptions  that  the
    evidence may have been material to the outcome.  It  was  open  to  the
    appellant to have obtained  and  submitted  a  witness  statement  from
    Counsel who appeared before the judge (Mr M Murphy) and  the  notes  of
    Counsel. He did not do so.

35. In any event, we noted that the grounds,  which  were  prepared  by  Mr
    Murphy, made no mention of the content of Mr Javed's oral evidence  nor
    do the grounds contend that he gave evidence  about  the  first  visit.
    This despite the fact that the grounds contend that  the  judge  placed
    too much emphasis on the first report. Furthermore, we can see from the
    Presenting Officer's notes of the evidence (we have explained  that  we
    were unable to decipher the judge's record of the proceedings) that the
    oral evidence that Mr Javed gave focused upon the issue concerning  the
    warmth or otherwise of one or other bed, an issue which  was  mentioned
    only in the second report.

36. We therefore decide this appeal on the basis that Mr Javed did not give
    oral evidence about the first report. Leaving  aside  para  16  of  his
    witness statement which we will deal with later, it is  clear  from  Mr
    Javed's witness statement that his written evidence concerned the first
    report.

37. Next, we deal with Mr Bellara's  submission  that  the  reason  why  Mr
    Javed's witness statement focused upon the second report is because the
    refusal letter placed weight on the second report.

38. With respect, we have to say that this  does  not  help  the  appellant
    establish that the judge materially erred in law. Even if  we  have  an
    explanation as to why Mr Javed focused on the second report, we  cannot
    enter into any speculative assumptions about the evidence he  may  have
    given if he had not focused on the second report.

39. Rightly, Mr Bellara did not argue before us that the appellant has been
    deprived of the opportunity of having his witnesses deal with the first
    report because they were misled into focusing on the second report as a
    consequence of the contents of the refusal  letter.  Such  an  argument
    cannot have any purchase for the simple reason that the contents of the
    first and second reports were both known to the appellant. He  and  his
    witnesses chose to focus on the second report, whether or  not  on  the
    advice of the appellant's representatives.

40. Next, we noted that Mr Wilding did  not  suggest  that  the  judge  had
    stated, in terms, that he had considered the written and oral  evidence
    of Mr Javed. We have noted that there is no mention at all of Mr  Javed
    by name or by his relationship with Ms Javed in the judge's decision at
    all.

41. The mere fact that a judge does not  refer,  in  terms,  to  particular
    evidence does not mean that it  was  not  considered.  Judges  are  not
    obliged to refer to every piece of the evidence. It is clear  from  the
    judge's decision that he had many live witnesses. His  decision  refers
    to a total of 12 live witnesses - the appellant, Ms Javed and ten other
    witnesses. It is plain that  the  witnesses  gave  evidence  about  the
    genuineness of the relationship between the  appellant  and  Ms  Javed.
    That was evidence that the judge plainly had in mind.  Accordingly,  we
    do not accept that the mere fact that the  judge  did  not  mention  in
    terms that Mr Javed was a witness or that he did not mention  in  terms
    Mr Javed's evidence means  that  he  did  not  take  into  account  his
    evidence that the relationship was a genuine and subsisting one.

42. The evidence of Mr Javed concerning the timing of the marriage and that
    he conducted the marriage was not material to the  outcome  given  that
    the respondent does not contend that the marriage did not  take  place.
    Accordingly, there was no need for the judge to mention this aspect  of
    the evidence of Mr Javed.

43. Mr Bellara relied upon para 16 of Mr Javed's statement. Mr Javed states
    at para 16 that he would never allow his only daughter to sleep with  a
    man if the marriage was not genuine. However, we agree with Mr  Wilding
    that para 16 of Mr Javed's statement was not material  to  the  outcome
    because the respondent's allegation  was  that  the  marriage  was  not
    genuine from inception and that the appellant and  Ms  Javed  were  not
    sleeping together.

44. For all of the reasons given above, we do not  accept  that  the  judge
    overlooked considering the written and oral evidence of  Mr  Javed.  In
    any event, we do not  accept  that  his  evidence  could  have  made  a
    material difference to the outcome.

45. Whilst the grounds also contend that the judge did not engage with  the
    evidence of the remaining witnesses (other than the  appellant  and  Ms
    Javed), this was not the subject  of  any  specific  submission  by  Mr
    Bellara. He merely relied upon the general point, that  the  judge  had
    not engaged with the evidence of the witnesses.

46. However, it is clear that the judge summarised the evidence of most  of
    these witnesses; for example, Ms Javed's mother and her  two  brothers,
    the appellant's uncle and his other relative.  A  specific  credibility
    point arose from the evidence of Ms Javed's  mother,  i.e.  as  to  the
    reason why Ms Javed did not wear her engagement ring, which  the  judge
    dealt with at para 16 where he noted that the evidence  of  Ms  Javed's
    mother in this regard contradicted the evidence of  Ms  Javed  herself.
    The remainder of the evidence of the supporting witnesses concerned the
    genuineness of the marriage, which the judge was plainly aware of,  and
    the second report which the judge plainly placed little  or  no  weight
    on.

47. Accordingly, there is no substance in the assertion in the grounds that
    the judge materially erred in law by  failing  to  consider,  and  make
    findings of fact upon, the evidence of the supporting witnesses. We are
    satisfied that he considered the evidence before him  adequately,  that
    he gave adequate reasons and made adequate findings of fact.

48. We record that any remaining grounds were not advanced at the hearing.

49. It is appropriate that we should comment upon the terms in which  Judge
    Hollingworth granted permission. He considered  it  arguable  that  the
    judge fell into error in considering in the round the weight to  attach
    to the evidence of the several witnesses and that it was arguable  that
    the evidence of each witness fell to  be  assessed.   For  the  reasons
    given above, we are  satisfied  that  there  was  no  such  error.  The
    remainder of  Judge  Hollingworth's  reasons  essentially  concern  the
    weight to be given to particular aspects of the evidence. However, this
    is a matter for the first instance judge and will rarely give rise to a
    material error of law. This is not one  of  those  cases,  nor  did  Mr
    Bellara make this point.

      Decision


    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    any material error of law.
