                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Proceedings

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Ivory Coast born on  3rd  February  1983.
    She  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  dated  10th
    September 2013 to refuse her application  for  a  derivative  residence
    card as the primary carer of a British citizen resident in  the  United
    Kingdom  pursuant  to  Regulation  15A  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations").   Her  appeal
    was allowed at first instance  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Lester sitting at Taylor House on 13th  May  2014.   The  matter  comes
    before me as an appeal by the Respondent against that decision but  for
    the sake of convenience I will continue to refer to the parties as they
    were known at first instance.

2.   The Appellant has been in the United Kingdom  with  leave  since  2002.
    She married a French national exercising treaty rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom Mr Ademola Adetoye on 29th March 2010.   He  had  been  granted
    permanent residence the year before.  As a result of that marriage  the
    Appellant was issued with a residence card on 28th September 2010 valid
    until 28th September 2015.  The Appellant's daughter A was born on 23rd
    July 2010.  By that stage the Appellant and her husband  had  separated
    and the Appellant has not seen him or had any contact  with  him  since
    2010.  A is a British citizen and was issued with a  passport  on  28th
    March 2012.  A has had and continues to have serious  medical  problems
    having been diagnosed at an early  age  with  an  autoimmune  condition
    which has necessitated repeated hospital admissions, invasive treatment
    and medication with strong drugs.  She remains under the care of  Great
    Ormond Street Hospital where she has regular appointments.

3.   On 31st August 2012 the Appellant applied for  a  derivative  residence
    card as the primary carer of A a British citizen. The burden  of  proof
    of establishing that the requirements of the 2006 Regulations were  met
    rested upon the Appellant and the standard of proof was the usual civil
    standard of balance of probabilities. In arriving  at  its  conclusions
    the Tribunal was obliged to take into account facts and matters at  the
    date of hearing.  Under Regulation 15A the Appellant had to demonstrate
    she was the primary carer of a British citizen who was residing in  the
    UK and who would be unable to reside in the UK or in another EEA  State
    if her primary  carer  were  required  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    "Primary carer" was defined as a direct relative or legal guardian  and
    the person who has primary responsibility for that person's care.

4.   The Judge found on the evidence that  it  was  inconceivable  that  the
    Appellant could leave A in the United Kingdom while she returned to the
    Ivory Coast.  The whole purpose of obtaining a British passport  for  A
    was so that the Appellant and A could  travel  together  to  the  Ivory
    Coast to be with the Appellant's mother who was sick.  There  was  some
    uncertainty as  to  whether  adequate  medical  care  for  A  would  be
    available in the Ivory Coast and even if it were whether  it  would  be
    affordable.  The Appellant was the only one who had provided for A.  To
    separate A from the Appellant at this stage of  A's  life  would  cause
    very serious consequences for A's physical  and  psychological  health.
    The Judge allowed the appeal.

5.   The Respondent appealed against that decision  taking  an  issue  which
    had not been raised at first instance.  The  Appellant  was  an  exempt
    person under the 2006 Regulations because she had been  issued  with  a
    residence card which excluded her  from  entitlement  to  a  derivative
    right to reside in the United Kingdom (Regulation 15A(1)).   An  exempt
    person is defined by Regulation 15A(6)(c) as a person who has  a  right
    to reside in the United Kingdom as a result of any other provisions  of
    the 2006 Regulations.  The Appellant had  a  right  to  reside  in  the
    United Kingdom as a result of the Residence Card issued to her pursuant
    to Regulation 17 of the 2006 Regulations.  She was  still  entitled  to
    the residence card that  she  had  notwithstanding  that  she  and  her
    husband had separated  pursuant  to  the  case  of  Amos  [2011]  EWCA.
    Separation short of divorce did not affect the  right  of  the  non-EEA
    national  spouse  under  Article  16  of  the  Directive   (which   was
    implemented by the 2006 Regulations) to hold a Residence Card  if  both
    the EEA national and his or her non-national spouse continue to  reside
    in the same Member State.  There was no need for the Judge to  consider
    the substantive application under Regulation  15A(4a)  and  the  appeal
    should have been dismissed for that reason.

6.   The application for permission to appeal came before  Designated  Judge
    McClure on the papers on 24th June 2014.   In  granting  permission  to
    appeal he noted that the Appellant was separated from her  husband  but
    not divorced and it was not suggested that the existing residence  card
    was going to be withdrawn.  The grounds were arguable.

7.   There was no Rule 24 response filed on behalf of the Appellant  to  the
    grant of permission to appeal and the matter came before me  to  decide
    whether there was an error of law in the determination.  The  point  at
    issue was a narrow one, if the Appellant was an exempt person there was
    no valid appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.   If  she  was  not  an
    exempt person then the decision of the First-tier Tribunal would  stand
    as there was no dispute that but for her status as an exempt person the
    Appellant would otherwise have been entitled  to  a  derived  right  of
    residence as a carer. The Appellant's departure from the United Kingdom
    would leave the Appellant without anyone to care for her.

8.   In submissions the Presenting Officer indicated he was content to  rely
    on the grounds of appeal.  When her  existing  residence  card  expires
    next year the Appellant could apply for permanent right  of  residence.
    For the Appellant Counsel  argued  that  the  case  of  Amos  could  be
    distinguished from the instant case because the Appellant did not  know
    where her husband was and could not therefore say that her husband  was
    residing in the United Kingdom.   That  the  Appellant  was  an  exempt
    person was not a point made  at  first  instance.   The  Appellant  was
    concerned that were she to leave the United Kingdom and  then  seek  to
    return she might face difficulties upon  production  of  her  residence
    card if she was asked as to the whereabouts of her husband.  She  would
    not know the answer to that question.

9.   In the refusal  letter  the  Respondent  had  impliedly  suggested  the
    Appellant could apply on the basis of a derived residence card stating:

         "If you consider that you have a right  to  reside  in  the  United
         Kingdom as a matter of European law and are in a position to submit
         the  necessary  information  to  support  your  application  for  a
         derivative residence card as recognition of  that  right,  you  may
         wish to submit a further application for consideration".

    The reasons for refusal letter had not taken  issue  with  whether  the
    Appellant was an exempt person but argued instead  that  there  was  no
    evidence as to why A's father was not in a  position  to  care  for  A.
    That issue was no longer relevant because of the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal.



Findings

10.  If the Appellant has an existing right to reside in the United  Kingdom
    under the 2006 Regulations she is an exempt person and cannot apply for
    another form of  residence  card  in  this  case  a  derived  right  of
    residence card.  That is not in dispute in this case.  What appears  to
    be in dispute is the issue of whether the  Appellant  continues  to  be
    entitled to a residence card as she is separated from her  husband  and
    does not know where he is.  Somewhat unusually it is the Appellant  who
    is making the argument that she is not entitled to a residence card  or
    perhaps more accurately that she would not be entitled to a renewal  of
    her residence card when her existing residence card expires next  year.
    Even if that were correct and for the reasons which I set out  below  I
    do not accept that argument,  it  still  would  not  affect  the  basic
    position that the Appellant has a residence card and there are no plans
    by the Respondent to seek to withdraw it.

11.  Quite the contrary the Respondent's position is that the  card  remains
    valid and thus the Appellant is an exempt person.  She was not entitled
    to apply for another form of residence card  notwithstanding  that  the
    factual matrix in this case shows that had it not  been  for  the  fact
    that she was an exempt person she would otherwise have been entitled to
    a derived right of residence.  The short answer to this appeal is  that
    there was no valid appeal before the First-tier  Tribunal  because  the
    Appellant could not apply for a derived right of residence card because
    she was an exempt person.  She was prohibited by Regulation 15A which I
    have cited above from applying for a derived right of residence card.

12.  The Appellant's concern is that her status as a holder of  a  residence
    card may be called into question either when she seeks to re-enter  the
    United Kingdom from a trip abroad  or  when  she  seeks  to  renew  her
    residence card next year given that her marriage  to  her  husband  has
    broken down and she does not know where he is

13.  In relation to the first point whilst  I  understand  her  concern,  it
    does imply that immigration officials would not  properly  respect  the
    residence card to which she is entitled. That does not seem to me to be
    an issue which I can consider as there is no evidence that officials of
    the UK Border Agency would fail to respect the issue of  the  residence
    card.

14.  The Respondent has given an assurance that the residence card will  not
    be withdrawn and there appears to  be  no  reason  why  it  should  be.
    Whilst it is correct that the Appellant does not know where her husband
    is, they remain legally  married  notwithstanding  that  they  are  not
    living together.  Separation short of divorce was held by the  European
    Court of Justice in the well-known case of Diatta [1985] ECR 567 not to
    affect the right of the non-national spouse under  Article  16  of  the
    Citizens' Directive if both  the  EEA  national  and  the  non-national
    spouse continue to reside in  the  same  Member  State.   Even  if  the
    Appellant does not know where her husband is, it would still be for the
    Respondent to show that he was not residing in the United Kingdom.  The
    Appellant and her husband last resided together in the  United  Kingdom
    and there is no evidence that he has left the United Kingdom.  The case
    of Amos still applies to the facts of the present case.  The  Appellant
    is thus still entitled to her residence card and there seems no  reason
    why next year when that card expires she will  not  be  entitled  to  a
    permanent right of residence.

15.  In this connection it is useful to note the Upper Tribunal decision  in
    the case of Bee [2013] UKUT 83 which held that a non-EU citizen who  is
    residing in the  United  Kingdom  by  reason  of  a  derived  right  of
    residence for example as the primary  carer  of  an  EU  citizen  child
    cannot thereby acquire a permanent right of  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The derived right of residence card which the  Appellant  was
    seeking might have put her in a  worse  position  (when  it  eventually
    expired) than the present residence  card  to  which  she  is  entitled
    (which she can use to acquire permanent residence in the future).

16.  I appreciate that the  Respondent  did  not  raise  the  issue  of  the
    Appellant's exempt status at first instance.  That does not  invalidate
    the Respondent's appeal against the decision of  the  First-tier  since
    the question of the Appellant's exempt status went to the  question  of
    the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to hear the appeal at all.  There  was
    no waiver by the Respondent that jurisdiction  was  not  in  issue  the
    matter simply was not raised.  Even if it were consent does  not  found
    jurisdiction. There was never a  valid  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The  Appellant  cannot  succeed  under  the  Rules  and   no
    submissions were made to me in relation to Article 8.

17.  There remains the issue of the fee award.  The Judge  in  allowing  the
    appeal made a fee award against the Respondent in the sum of �140 which
    was the fee payable.  Although I have overturned the  Judge's  decision
    and allowed the Respondent's appeal, I bear in mind that the  issue  of
    the Appellant's exempt status was not raised at first instance when  it
    could and  should  have  been.   I  am  not  therefore  minded  in  the
    particular circumstances of this case to reverse the fee award made  by
    Judge Lester at first instance.  That fee award will therefore stand.

Decision

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

The fee award of the First-tier Tribunal will stand.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.  I have remade the decision by  dismissing  the
Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse  to  issue  a
derived right of residence card.

The Respondent's decision against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
allowed.

The Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision dismissed.
