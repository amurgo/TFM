Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Ogolo
For the Respondent:    Ms Ong, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of DRC who appeals with permission,  against
    the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Phull  who  dismissed  her
    appeal against the  decision  of  the  Respondent  refusing  her  entry
    clearance as the spouse of Yvon-Bapius Gustave  (the  Sponsor),  a  man
    settled here.

 2. The Entry Clearance  Officer  originally  refused  the  application  on
    several grounds under the Immigration Rules but the Judge  hearing  the
    appeal on 23rd May  2013  dismissed  it  on  one  ground  only;  namely
    paragraph 281(ii) as she found that the Appellant had failed to provide
    an English Language Test Certificate.

 3. The Appellant sought permission to appeal. This  was  granted  and  the
    matter came before me on 7th August 2013 at Field House.

 4. At the outset of the hearing,  Ms  Ong  conceded  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had fallen into  error  in  dismissing  the  Appellant's
    appeal. She accepted that what had been put forward by the  Appellant's
    representatives, namely that an applicant from the DRC is  exempt  from
    the English language requirement, was  correct.  Ms  Ong  advised  that
    there is no test centre in the DRC. As this was the only  matter  which
    troubled the First-tier Tribunal Judge, Ms Ong invited me to allow  the
    appeal.

 5. Mr Ogolo not surprisingly had nothing further to add to  this.  He  too
    invited me to allow the appeal.

DECISION

 6. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge contains an error of  law
    in that there is no requirement for an applicant from  DRC  to  satisfy
    the English legal requirement test.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge is set aside. I remake the decision.

 7. This appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made
