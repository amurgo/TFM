                          Determination and Reasons

Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr Al-Rashid, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Background

   1.       In a determination promulgated on 31 March 2014, I set aside the
      decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Widdup dated 20 January 2014  to
      allow the  appeal  for  entry  clearance  as  a  spouse  made  by  the
      appellant. I attach the reasons for my decision as an  annex  to  this
      determination.
   2.       The appellant is a citizen of Vietnam born on 14 March 1986.  He
      appeals the  respondent's  decision  to  refuse  to  grant  him  entry
      clearance as a spouse. He was previously  in  the  UK  as  a  student,
      married the sponsor and then returned to Vietnam and subsequently made
      this application. On 19 November 2012  (served  on  20  November)  the
      application was refused on the basis that the marriage was not genuine
      and subsisting, that the maintenance requirements had not been met and
      that there was a lack of evidence with respect to  accommodation.  The
      only live issue now is whether the maintenance requirements have  been
      met. Article 8 was not relied on at the previous hearing  and  despite
      my observations on this in my error of law  decision,  no  request  to
      vary the grounds to include it were made by Counsel on 19 May 2014.

Appeal hearing

   3.       No fresh documentary evidence was submitted prior to the hearing
      but  at  the  commencement  of  the  hearing  I  received   additional
      documents. From the respondent: a copy of the rules as  they  were  at
      the date of  the  decision.  From  the  appellant:  refusal  of  entry
      clearance in respect of a fresh application made by the  appellant,  a
      letter dated 15 May  2014  from  Thi  Bich  Thuy  Nguyen,  Manager  of
      Dockland Nails and a letter dated 14 May 2014 from ABFS ltd.

   4.       After some preliminary discussion the parties were  agreed  that
      in order to succeed the appellant needed to satisfy the court that  he
      could meet the requirements of the rules as highlighted by the ECO  in
      his refusal; i.e. with regard to the concerns over the lack of certain
      documents required and the credibility  of  the  sponsor's  employment
      with Dockland Nails.

   5.       I heard submissions from the parties.  Mr  Al-Rashid  sought  to
      persuade me that  the  appellant  had  met  the  requirements  of  the
      maintenance rules in that the Tribunal had the sponsor's P60s for  the
      year ending 5 April 2012  in  respect  of  both  her  employment  with
      Superdry trading as C-Retail and  Dockland  Nails  (DN).  He  took  me
      through the documents and submitted that the ECO had  payslips  for  6
      months  for  both  employments,  that  the  salary  for  c-retail  was
      corroborated by deposits into the sponsor's Halifax account  and  that
      the DN employment was largely established by deposits  into  the  HSBC
      account and by the employer's letter.

   6.       Mr Duffy submitted that he accepted that the requirements of pay
      slips and bank statements for six months had been met  in  respect  of
      the c-retail employment but submitted that it had not  in  respect  of
      the DN employment. There had been concerns on the part of the  ECO  in
      respect of the DN employment and the bank statements did not show  the
      payment of the sponsor's salary into her account. That meant that  the
      requirements of 2(f)  of  FM-SE  were  not  met.  Additionally,  under
      15(b)(i) a sponsor's gross income must be �18,600 for a period  of  12
      months prior to the decision although it need only be evidenced by six
      months' worth of payslips and bank statements. There was  no  evidence
      before the court as to the sponsor's income for the 12 months prior to
      the application therefore the appeal could not succeed on  that  basis
      either. Finally, he submitted that the  fresh  application  for  entry
      clearance had no relevance to this appeal.

   7.       I then heard oral evidence from  the  sponsor,  Nguyat  On.  She
      confirmed that she had commenced employment with C-Retail in  June  or
      July of 2010 and with DN in April 2012. She had  not  had  other  paid
      employment, apart from with C-retail prior to taking on the work  with
      DN. She worked part time with each. She was paid cash in hand at DN to
      begin with. The first month she received weekly payments;  after  that
      the payments were made monthly.  She  did  not  spend  it  and  always
      deposited the cash and then, if necessary, used her card to pay bills.
      She was now paid by BACS.

   8.       The sponsor confirmed that she had been overpaid when she  first
      started working for DN. She had repaid the  overpayment  slowly;  some
      was deducted from her overtime salary and some from tips.

   9.       In cross examination the sponsor was asked  the  source  of  the
      cash deposit of �900 in her HSBD account in August 2012.  She  replied
      that her mother gave her that money for a holiday. She confirmed  that
      her DN wages had always been paid into the HSBC account.

  10.       In re-examination the  sponsor  was  asked  about  several  cash
      payments into her Halifax account in June 2012. She replied they  were
      sums given to her by her father for flights. She was going to Vietnam.
       She confirmed that the �900  HSBC  deposit  was  definitely  for  her
      holiday.

  11.       In response to my questions, the sponsor said that  she  had  no
      confirmation from her employer that the monies had  been  repaid.  She
      herself did not keep a record of what she had paid.  She  started  her
      repayments about 3-4 months after the commencement of her  employment.
      She made repayments once a month and ceased them about two months ago.
      She could not say how much had been  repaid;  the  amount  varied  and
      sometimes she made no repayments at all. Her manager told her when the
      amount had been repaid in full.

  12.       The sponsor confirmed she had worked overtime but said  she  was
      paid cash for those days; the money was not added onto her wage slips.
      She had realised she had been overpaid.

  13.       When asked why she had not deposited her salary cheques  as  and
      when they were received, she replied that she had been lazy.
  14.       The sponsor confirmed that she had been paid in  late  September
      for her October salary. When asked when she had paid in  her  April  -
      June salaries, she could not give a reply. She said she  had  not  put
      them in; she did not keep up to date with financial matters.

  15.       There were no questions arising  and  that  completed  the  oral
      evidence.

  16.       Mr Duffy relied on his earlier submissions which set out why the
      requirements of the rules could not be met, he  suggested  there  were
      dubious employment practices ongoing at DN and one of the reasons  for
      the requirement for documentary evidence of employment was  so  as  to
      prevent appellants relying on unlawful employment.

  17.       Mr Al-Rashid accepted that the  bank  statements  sis  not  show
      corresponding payments for all the required six months  but  submitted
      that was too strict an interpretation of the rules and  it  interfered
      disproportionately with the private lives of  the  appellant  and  the
      sponsor. If someone did not want to pay in a  salary  that  was  their
      business and nothing to do with the ECO. Judge Widdup had  found  that
      the sponsor's combined employment amounted to �19,277.  There  was  no
      requirement for a sponsor to show a salary had been received for up to
      12 months; that was just  Mr  Duffy's  interpretation  of  the  rules.
      Paragraph 15 only served to calculate an annual income; anything  else
      would be a draconian interference with family life.  He submitted that
      the sponsor had not been diligent in paying in her salary and had been
      unsure about the cash deposits into her Halifax account. In the recent
      entry clearance  application  the  maintenance  requirements  were  no
      longer an issue. The whole case should be considered in the round, the
      relationship was genuine and the sponsor had been back twice.

  18.       At the conclusion of the hearing I dismissed the  appeal  and  I
      now give full reasons for doing so.

Conclusions

  19.       I have carefully considered the documentary evidence before  the
      ECO and before the Tribunal.  I accept Mr  Al-Rashid's  suggestion  of
      following the ECO's concerns in  the  refusal  letter  as  a  starting
      point. His submission that the  absence  of  any  issues  raised  with
      regard to the other evidence meant that the ECO was satisfied with it,
      is, I find, a fair assumption to make and I  proceed  on  the  premise
      that the ECO's concerns were with the documentary evidence as set  out
      in the decision letter and with the genuineness of the  employment  at
      DN.

  20.       With respect to the sponsor's  employment,  the  appellant  must
      provide:
          . P60(s)
          . Salary slips for a six month period prior to  the  date  of  the
            application
          . Bank  statements  showing  deposits  which  confirm  the  salary
            payments.
          . The total sum of the income earned from the employment  must  be
            at least �18,600 gross.

  21.       Mr Duffy accepted that the requirements for a P60, salary  slips
      and bank statements in respect of the  employment  with  C-retail  had
      been met. However he argued that the same could not be said of the  DN
      employment and I have to  agree  with  him  on  that.   The  sponsor's
      evidence was that she commenced that employment on 1 April  2012.  Her
      evidence, backed up by a letter from her employer, was  that  she  had
      been overpaid and that she received �830 a month instead  of  �756.08.
      The argument before the First-tier Tribunal had been that this was why
      the deposits into the HSBC account did not tally with  the  lower  sum
      shown on the salary slips. The same argument  was  put  to  me.  I  am
      afraid I do not accept this explanation.

  22.       I note that the sponsor's evidence to me was that she  commenced
      her repayments of the overpayments three or four months after starting
      work at DN when the error came to light. However that  conflicts  with
      the letter from her employer which is that she was overpaid  in  error
      for eight months. Plainly the  sponsor  could  not  have  been  making
      repayments after three or four months and yet still being overpaid for
      another four of five months. That makes  no  sense.  It  is  also  not
      explained how this error of overpayment occurred in the  first  place.
      It would have been more believable had the amount on the pay slip also
      been wrong but it is difficult  to  accept  that  month  after  months
      salary slips were prepared giving one figure but the sponsor was  paid
      a different, higher sum. Not only would the discrepancy  in  the  sums
      have been immediately obvious to the manager but also to the  sponsor.



  23.       I also found the sponsor's evidence on how much she repaid to be
      extremely vague. Despite repeated questions she could not give even an
      approximate figure of what she paid, or how regularly and  I  find  it
      lacking in credibility that's he kept no note at all of the  sums  she
      paid. I also note that she gave contradictory evidence of how  it  was
      paid, stating first that it was deducted  from  her  salary  but  then
      stating it was paid in cash to her manager out of  her  overtime  cash
      in hand payments, or alternatively from tips.

  24.       Even more peculiar was the sponsor's evidence that she was  lazy
      about paying in her salary so that, according to the evidence, we  see
      nothing deposited from DN until 9 August 2012 even though the  sponsor
      was supposed to have commenced employment  with  them  in  April  that
      year. Given that she needed help from her parents to the tune of  some
      �1800 (cash payments made to her Halifax and HSBC accounts) I  do  not
      accept she would have just  sat  on  wage  cheques  which  would  have
      totalled more than that and which she clearly needed if she had indeed
      been paid as claimed.

  25.       The evidence shows that there were four cheques  deposited  into
      the HSBC account during the period up to the date of the  decision  in
      November 2012; that is to say, �830  was  deposited  on  each  of  the
      following dates: 9 August, 4 September, 25 September and 6 November. I
      am told that there were two payments in September because  the  second
      one was an early payment for  the  October  salary  as  the  sponsor's
      employer was going away on holiday. However there is  no  evidence  at
      all of the cash payments made to her in April,  May,  June  and  July.
      That means over �3000 is unaccounted for. It does not show up  in  the
      later statements either and the sponsor's evidence was  that  she  did
      not spend any of it. If the employment was genuine, then what happened
      to the sponsor's income between April and July is  a  mystery.  It  is
      also a mystery as to how a cheque for �830 could have deposited  on  4
      August 2012 when the sponsor did not receive that cheque  (as  payment
      for August) until 31 August (see page 33). The deposit could not refer
      to the July or any of the earlier payments as those were all  made  in
      cash. The first cheque payment was received on 31 August yet as stated
      a cheque for �830 was paid into the account on 4 August. There is also
      no evidence in October of the deposit for the September  salary  which
      should have been received at the end of  the  month,  along  with  the
      advance on the October salary. The latter is  deposited  but  not  the
      former.

  26.       Further, the fact that the sponsor was still receiving  �830  in
      November does not accord  with  her  evidence  that  she  had  started
      repaying the extra amount she had been  erroneously  been  paid,  some
      months earlier.

  27.       I have considered the letter from ABFS Ltd. but as it relates to
      the sponsor's income in the period for 2013/14 it is not  relevant  to
      evidence as at the date of the decision.

  28.       For all these reasons I am unable to find that the  sponsor  was
      employed as claimed by DN in the six months leading up to the date  of
      the decision. I find that the ECO was right  to  dispute  the  claimed
      employment. The figures just do not tally and the  sponsor's  evidence
      has been unsatisfactory and contradictory. There may well be something
      illegitimate about DN's  employment  practices,  as  suggested  by  Mr
      Duffy, or the employment may not exist at  all.  I  cannot  speculate.
      What I can say is that there are insufficient  deposits  in  the  bank
      account to demonstrate that the sponsor received  the  claimed  income
      from  DN.  Without  that  employment,  she  cannot  meet  the  �18,600
      threshold.

  29.       Mr Al-Rashid submitted that the lack of deposits did not  matter
      as that would be too strict an interpretation of the  rules.  However,
      there is no issue of interpretation in this case. The rules are  plain
      as to what is required by way of documentary evidence.  The  appellant
      has not shown what he is required to show. On that  basis  his  appeal
      cannot succeed.

  30.       It was also submitted that the rules requiring sponsors to pay a
      cash wage into a bank account violated their private lives. I can  see
      no merit in such a submission. It is fair,  in  my  view,  to  require
      independently verifiable evidence of an ability to maintain and it  is
      hardly onerous to show that a salary is paid into an account for a six
      month period.  In any event, however, there  is  no  Article  8  claim
      before me.

  31.       I would say that  I  have  doubts  with  regard  to  Mr  Duffy's
      submission that paragraph 15  requires  a  sponsor  to  have  been  in
      employment for at least 12 months prior to an application. It would be
      illogical to require a sponsor to have been  in  employment  for  that
      period or longer yet to require no evidence of  it.  However,  as  the
      appeal fails under FM-SE, paragraph 2 (f), there is no need to  pursue
      that submission any further.

  32.       Finally, I was given a  copy  of  the  appellant's  fresh  entry
      clearance  refusal  of  28  January  2014  and  note  that  it  is  on
      relationship grounds only  and  not  on  maintenance  but  I  have  no
      information on the nature of the evidence submitted in support of that
      application and in any event that is a post decision fact which is not
      relevant to my determination of this appeal.

Decision

  33.       The appeal is dismissed on  immigration  grounds.  There  is  no
      Article 8 appeal before me.

      Dr R Keki?
      Judge           of            the            Upper            Tribunal

ANNEX:

Findings and Conclusions of error of law decision

      I have taken into account the submissions made and  the  determination
      of the First-tier  Tribunal.

      It has to be  said  that  this  determination  is  confusing  and  was
      probably not helped by the absence of a Home Office Presenting Officer
      at the First-tier Tribunal hearing.

      It is unclear from the determination as to which  documents  had  been
      adduced with the  application  (in  September  2012)  and  which  were
      submitted thereafter.  Whilst a letter from the  appellant's  previous
      representatives listing a number  of  documents  is  included  in  the
      respondent's bundle, it appears that it was not  submitted  until  the
      appeal was lodged (see section 3B of the Notice of Appeal) and  it  is
      not known if all the documents listed therein were attached to it. The
      ECO certainly does not appear to have seen the  documents  listed  and
      the EC Manager who reviewed the decision only refers to documents that
      are also listed at Section 3B rather than to  those  included  on  the
      list in the letter. A perusal of the refusal notice does  however  set
      out  the  documentary  evidence  the  ECO  had  before  him  when  the
      application was made.

      The respondent's position is that the appellant  failed  to  meet  the
      requirements of the rules because when he made  his  application,  the
      specified evidence adduced did  not  establish  that  the  maintenance
      requirements of the rules had been met. Mr  Al-Rashid  submitted  that
      there was no requirement  to  limit  consideration  to  the  documents
      submitted with the application.

      I have considered Appendix FM (E-ECP.3.1, ECP.1.1(d)) and Appendix FM-
      SE (paragraph D):
      EC-P.1.1. The requirements to be met for entry clearance as a partner
are that-

      (a) the applicant must be outside the UK;
      (b) the applicant must have made a valid application for entry
      clearance as a partner;
      (c) the applicant must not fall for refusal under any of the grounds
      in Section S-EC: Suitability-entry clearance; and
      (d) the applicant must meet all of the requirements of Section E-ECP:
      E-ECP.3.1. The applicant must provide specified evidence, from the
      sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of-

      (a) a specified gross annual income of at least-

      (i) �18,600;
      ..........

      Appendix FM-SE - Family members - specified evidence
      D. (a) In deciding an application in relation to which this Appendix
      states that specified documents must be provided, the Entry Clearance
      Officer or Secretary of State ("the decision-maker") will consider
      documents that have been submitted with the application, and will only
      consider documents submitted after the application where sub-paragraph
      (b) or (e) applies.

      (b) If the applicant:

      (i) Has submitted:

      (aa) A sequence of documents and some of the documents in the sequence
      have been omitted (e.g. if one bank statement from a series is
      missing);

      (bb) A document in the wrong format (for example, if a letter is not
      on letterhead paper as specified); or

      (cc) A document that is a copy and not an original document; or

      (dd) A document which does not contain all of the specified
information; or

      (ii) Has not submitted a specified document,

      the decision-maker may contact the applicant or his representative in
      writing or otherwise, and request the document(s) or the correct
      version(s). The material requested must be received at the address
      specified in the request within a reasonable timescale specified in
      the request.

      (c) The decision-maker will not request documents where he or she does
      not anticipate that addressing the error or omission referred to in
      sub-paragraph (b) will lead to a grant because the application will be
      refused for other reasons.

      (d) If the applicant has submitted:

      (i) A document in the wrong format; or

      (ii) A document that is a copy and not an original document, or

      (iii) A document that does not contain all of the specified
      information, but the missing information is verifiable from:

      (1) other documents submitted with the application,

      (2) the website of the organisation which issued the document, or

      (3) the website of the appropriate regulatory body,

      the application may be granted exceptionally, providing the decision-
      maker is satisfied that the document(s) is genuine and that the
      applicant meets the requirement to which the document relates. The
      decision-maker reserves the right to request the specified original

      ...............


      I did not have the advantage of hearing  submissions  on  these  rules
      except in the most general of terms. However, I note that paragraph  D
      of FM-SE came into force by way of HC 760 on 13 December 2012. As  the
      appellant's application and the decision on it both took place  before
      that date, it does not apply to him. In the absence of being  directed
      to any particular section of FM-SE (applicable at the relevant  time),
      I am unable to find that the appellant was required to adduce all  the
      specified documents at the date of application. There is force  in  Mr
      Al-Rashid submission  that  had  there  been  a  requirement  for  the
      consideration of documents to be limited to those submitted  with  the
      application, there would have been no point in an ECM review. I accept
      Ms Pettersen's submission that a review acts as a safeguard as  errors
      might well occur in the decision making process but in this  case  the
      review went well beyond that as the ECM  took  account  of  the  fresh
      documentary evidence that had been adduced.

      I note that the rules, as applicable from 13 December 2012,  do  allow
      for the application of  evidential  flexibility.  It  was  not  argued
      before the First-tier Tribunal or indeed  before  the  Upper  Tribunal
      that the ECO should have given the appellant an opportunity to  adduce
      additional documentary evidence pertaining to the sponsor's employment
      prior to making a decision. Given the absence of such an  argument,  I
      take that matter no further and in any event, as I stated, paragraph D
      does not apply to the appellant.

      As stated earlier,  I  found  the  determination  confusing.  This  is
      because I am not clear as to  the  findings  made  by  the  judge.  At
      paragraph 20 he states that  only  five  Superdry  payslips  had  been
      adduced as opposed  to  the  six  payslips  that  were  required  but,
      nevertheless, then goes on to find that the appellant  (sic)  complied
      with  the  evidential  requirements  of  the  rules   concerning   her
      employment. At paragraph 21 he  states  that  the  appellant  had  not
      worked for Dockland Nails (DN) for six  months  at  the  date  of  the
      application. He then goes on to find the sponsor's evidence in respect
      of her earnings from that employment to be unsatisfactory, noting that
      the payslips did not accord with the deposits in the  bank  statements
      and were not mentioned in the visa  application  (paragraph  22).   In
      paragraph 23, however, he finds that had the Secretary of State  taken
      the sponsor's annual pay into account for both jobs,  she  would  have
      seen that the combined income amounted to �19,277 at the date  of  the
      application.  This  finding  is  repeated  in  paragraph  26  but   in
      concluding the appeal the judge dismisses the  appeal  on  immigration
      grounds. I would have been prepared to accept, as Mr Al-Rashid argued,
      that the judge meant to allow the appeal but dismissed  it  in  error,
      had he not made the earlier contradictory findings. Moreover,  had  he
      meant to allow the appeal on immigration grounds, he  would  not  have
      needed to go on to allow it on Article 8 grounds  nor  would  he  have
      made the comments he did on the  appellant  having  to  make  a  fresh
      application under the rules. Essentially, the judge's various findings
      leave me confused as  to  what  he  actually  concluded  or  meant  to
      conclude.

      Moreover, contrary to what the judge stated at paragraph 32, and  what
      Mr Al-Rashid stated in his submissions, the ECO did  indeed  challenge
      the sponsor's claim to have worked with DN (penultimate  paragraph  of
      the refusal decision). The judge made a factual error in finding  that
      the ECO had not disputed that the sponsor worked for that employer.

      Additionally there are several anomalies with  the  sponsor's  claimed
      gross salary with DN; her payslips show one figure  and  her  contract
      shows another. There were attempts to  explain  away  a  third  figure
      which features in her bank statements, but that explanation  does  not
      resolve the inconsistencies in the evidence as to her basic  pay.  Nor
      is there any explanation for how, if certain  payments  were  made  by
      cheque (according to the payslips) they were paid in as cash and  vice
      versa or why there were numerous months when no deposits were made  at
      all. These difficulties were simply ignored by the judge or else  went
      unnoticed.

      The second challenge by the Secretary of State is that the judge erred
      in allowing the appeal  on  Article  8  grounds  because  he  did  not
      identify any exceptional circumstances for so doing.  I  note  Mr  Al-
      Rashid's point that he was not required to do so as he had found  that
      the requirements of  the  rules  had  been  met.  However,  given  the
      contents of paragraphs 18-20 above, I cannot  accept  that  the  judge
      made a clear finding that the requirements of the rules had been  met.
      In those circumstances, he  could  not  simply  allow  the  appeal  on
      Article 8 grounds, without identifying exceptional  circumstances  and
      particularly when Article 8 was not raised in the appellant's  grounds
      of appeal.

      Further, the judge erred when he stated in paragraph 32 that  the  ECO
      had not challenged the sponsor's employment; I have shown, above, that
      he had. So the only reason he gave for allowing the appeal on  Article
      8 grounds was so that the appellant would not have to submit a further
      application under the rules. No reason is given for why that would  be
      disproportionate. The initial application was decided in less than two
      months so there are no delays involved. The judge was required to  set
      out reasons why the appellant's appeal should  have  been  allowed  on
      Article 8 grounds where it was dismissed on  immigration  grounds.  He
      has failed to identify any  exceptional  circumstances  and  Counsel's
      suggestion that the sponsor's British nationality was  an  exceptional
      factor is, I regret to say, a factor commonly seen in such  cases.  It
      cannot be described as exceptional.

      So although the  Secretary  of  State  has  not  made  out  her  first
      challenge, that is to say, there was no requirement on the  appellant,
      at the date he  made  his  application,  to  have  submitted  all  his
      documents at that date, she succeeds  in  her  second  challenge.  The
      judge's confused findings and conclusions on immigration grounds  mean
      that it is wholly unclear whether he found that the appellant had  met
      the requirements of  the  rules  and  therefore  it  follows  that  in
      assessing Article 8, the judge was required  to  identify  exceptional
      factors before proceedings to allow the appeal on that basis.

      In view of the wholly unsatisfactory contents  of  this  determination
      and the lack of clarity in the findings and conclusions with regard to
      maintenance, I have decided that the decision in that respect, and  on
      Article 8, has to be set  aside.   Ms  Pettersen  confirmed  that  the
      findings on the genuine and subsisting marriage and accommodation were
      not challenged and so those findings are preserved. A hearing shall be
      arranged before the Upper Tribunal to decide whether  the  maintenance
      requirements of the rules have been met. Article 8 was not  raised  in
      the grounds of appeal to the ECO or in submissions by Counsel  at  the
      hearing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge. Unless an application is
      made for the grounds of appeal to be varied, it  cannot  therefore  be
      argued at this stage.
