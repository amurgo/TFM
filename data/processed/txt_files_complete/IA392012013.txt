                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 25th January 1990 is a citizen of Pakistan.   The
    Appellant was present at the hearing and represented by  Dr  Thorndyke.
    The Respondent was represented by Mr Harrison a Home Office  Presenting
    Officer.

Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellant had entered the United Kingdom on 17th April  2011  as  a
    student with leave to remain until 28th June 2013.  The  Appellant  had
    made an in time application in June 2013 for leave to remain further as
    a Tier 4 Student.  That application was refused by  the  Respondent  on
    6th August 2013.  The Appellant had  appealed  that  decision  and  his
    appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox sitting at  Stoke-on-
    Trent on 4th February 2014.  He dismissed the Appellant's appeal.

 3. Application for permission to appeal was sought and granted  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Keane on 11th  April  2014.   He  found  the  judge
    argued and made a material misdirection of  law  in  not  treating  the
    totality of the funds as available to the Appellant during the relevant
    period.

 4. I indicated to both  representatives  that  I  did  not  need  to  hear
    submissions in this case, found an error of law, set aside the decision
    and was able to remake the decision by allowing the appeal.  I  provide
    below my decision and reasons.

Decision and Reasons

 5. The refusal of the Appellant's application for leave  to  remain  as  a
    Tier 4 Student Migrant had been from the outset  on  one  ground  only.
    The Appellant required to show a sum of �1,600 in his account  for  the
    appropriate 28 day period.  There was a few days in that  period  where
    the amount in his account fell �34.05 below the minimum of �1,600.   At
    the time of the hearing the Respondent well knew the reason behind that
    short shortfall.  Indeed the judge at paragraph 7 of his  determination
    had  recorded  the  unequivocal  concessions  made  by  the  Presenting
    Officer.  In summary a mobile phone company had by error taken the  sum
    of �34.05 from the Appellant's bank account on 3rd June 2013,  realised
    that they had made an error in taking what was effectively a  duplicate
    payment and refunded the money on 6th June 2013.  That was the  factual
    background known to the Respondent at least on the day of  the  hearing
    of the appeal.  Nevertheless the Respondent pursued the appeal.

 6. It is clear that the First-tier Tribunal Judge felt constrained by  the
    Senior Courts in the cases of Patel [2013] UKSC  72  and  Nasim  [2014]
    UKUT 00025.  He took the view that there was no doctrine of  near  miss
    and accordingly felt constrained to dismiss the appeal.

 7. The new Immigration Rules do provide a detailed, and somewhat  complex,
    list of  matters  that  it  is  required  an  Appellant  fulfils.   The
    Executive have decided that such is the appropriate approach in dealing
    with applications under these aspects of the Immigration Rules and  the
    Superior Courts have properly  acknowledged  that  position  taken  and
    accordingly there is as such no manoeuvrability and  no  concept  of  a
    near miss.

 8. However this case does not constitute a near miss.  If the mobile phone
    company were authorised and had been entitled to take that  money  then
    this would have presented as a near miss.  If that money was  a  matter
    of dispute between the  mobile  phone  company  and  the  Appellant,  a
    dispute which had not been resolved, then again arguably those were not
    funds available to or necessarily belonging to the Appellant until such
    time as the resolution of such dispute and again  arguably  that  would
    have constituted a near miss.  It is however entirely  clear  from  the
    documents and the clear  concessions  made  by  the  Home  Office  that
    neither of the above scenarios occurred in this case.  The mobile phone
    company had erroneously and without any authority taken that small  sum
    as a duplicate direct debit or standing order  that  had  already  been
    paid.  In fairness to that  company  they  acknowledged  and  rectified
    their error swiftly and within a matter of three days.   It  was  never
    money they were entitled to and ownership of that money  did  not  pass
    from the Appellant to  the  mobile  phone  company.   It  remained  the
    Appellant's money at all times.  It was therefore an error to  describe
    this as a near miss and for the judge to have felt constrained by  that
    concept as enunciated by the Superior Courts.

 9. The circumstances  of  those  cases  relied  upon  by  the  judge  were
    different entirely to the circumstances of this case.  It would  in  my
    view be exceptionally difficult to imagine any Superior Court  in  this
    country failing to observe the fundamental unfairness in the  facts  of
    this case, describing it as a near  miss,  and  thereafter  compounding
    mani fold the injustice caused by the phone  company  by  refusing  his
    application.  It is a little surprising that the Home Office  chose  to
    use  limited  resources  in  pursuing  this  matter  where   experience
    indicates there are many other worthy causes of pursuit.

10. I find an error of law was made in this case which was clearly material
    to the outcome and set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    It was unnecessary for me to hear  further  evidence  in  remaking  the
    decision given the very narrow factual matrix described above  and  the
    clear concessions made by the Respondent.

Decision

11. I find a material error of law was made in the First-tier Tribunal  and
    set aside that decision and  in  remaking  the  decision  I  allow  the
    Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

    No anonymity order is made.
