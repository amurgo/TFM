Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Islam, Citylink Solicitors, Luton
For the Respondent:    Ms Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 7th February  1988.   He
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 20th  March  2014
    refusing to vary his leave to remain in the UK and  seeking  to  remove
    him by way of directions under Section 47 of  the  Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.  His appeal was heard by Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal R L Meates on 9th October 2014.  The appeal was dismissed
    in a determination promulgated on 28th October 2014.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    refused by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Juliet Grant  Hutchison  on
    14th January 2015.  Further grounds were lodged to the  Upper  Tribunal
    and permission was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  McGinty  on
    24th April 2015.  The permission states that although it was  indicated
    to the First-tier  Judge  that  Article  8  would  be  relied  on,  the
    Immigration Rules  have  been  amended  to  include  considerations  of
    Article 8 so there is an arguable error of law at paragraph 14  of  the
    determination as the judge simply concluded that the Appellant did  not
    meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE or Appendix FM without giving
    consideration to the same, or any reasons  for  his  decision  in  this
    regard.  No considerations as  to  which  parts  of  Appendix  FM  were
    satisfied or not have been given and no considerations have been  given
    to whether or not paragraph EX.1 was engaged.

 3. The permission goes on to state that it is an arguable  material  error
    of law for the First-tier Judge to have failed  to  consider  the  line
    authority following Chikwamba and in particular the case of MA Pakistan
    [2009] EWCA Civ 953. It states that he should  have  done  this  rather
    than simply finding that the Appellant can return to Pakistan  to  make
    an application as a spouse or fianc�.  The grounds go on to state  that
    it is an arguable material error of law for  the  First-tier  Judge  to
    have  had  in  mind  questions  as  to  whether  or   not   there   are
    insurmountable objects to family life continuing, for the  purposes  of
    determining proportionality under the fifth stage of the  Razgar  test,
    at paragraph 19.  In such circumstances the permission states that  all
    the Grounds of Appeal raised are arguable.

 4. There is a Rule 24 response from the Respondent dated  4th  June  2015.
    This  states  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  directed  himself
    appropriately.  With regard to the EX.1 situation, the Rule 24 response
    states that even if there was  an  obligation  on  the  Judge  to  have
    considered this, assuming the Appellant was able to reach consideration
    of EX.1 as per current case law, there was no prospect of the Appellant
    ever succeeding.  The case of Agyarko & Others, (R on  the  application
    of) v The Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2015]  Civ  440
    showing that the submission based on Section EX.1 should  be  rejected.
    This case states at  paragraph  21,  that  the  phrase  "insurmountable
    obstacles" as used in this paragraph of the  Rules  clearly  imposes  a
    high hurdle to be overcome by an applicant, for leave to  remain  under
    the Rules.  The test is significantly more demanding than a  mere  test
    of whether it would be reasonable to expect a couple to continue  their
    family life outside the  United  Kingdom.   The  response  goes  on  to
    consider the Chikwamba point and refers to paragraphs 27 to 31  of  the
    said case of Agyarko.  This states that in a case involving  precarious
    family life it is necessary to establish that  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances to warrant the conclusion that there would be a violation
    of Article 8 if the Appellant seeking leave to remain were removed from
    the United Kingdom and forced to make an out-of-country application for
    leave to enter.  The response goes  on  to  state  that  there  was  no
    evidence that the requirements of Appendix FM-SE were  satisfied.   The
    case of SS v (Congo) & Others [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  states  that  the
    approach to Article 8 in the light  of  the  Rules  in  Appendix  FM-SE
    should be the same as in respect of the substantive LTE and  LTR  Rules
    in Appendix FM.  The same general  position  applies,  that  compelling
    circumstances would have to apply to justify a grant of leave to  enter
    or leave to remain where the Immigration Rules are not complied with.

The Hearing

 5. The Appellant's representative submitted that all the terms of Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules can now be satisfied as the  Appellant  has
    been the partner of a British citizen for two years now and the  income
    threshold can be met.  I was asked to make a new  decision  even  if  I
    find  there  to  be  no  error  of  law  in  the   First-tier   Judge's
    determination.

 6. The Presenting Officer submitted that  the  bundle  provided  for  this
    error of law hearing contains a lot of documents which were not  before
    the First-tier Judge.  I was referred to the original  bundle  and  she
    submitted that there has been no Rule 15A application to  submit  these
    additional documents and that this error of law hearing should be dealt
    with based on the original bundle.

 7. The Appellant's representative submitted  that  the  new  documentation
    should be considered as this claim can now succeed under Appendix FM of
    the Rules.  I was referred to the skeleton argument and the grounds  of
    application.  He submitted that the only reason it was found  that  the
    Appellant could not meet the terms of Appendix FM, relying on EX.1, was
    that the relationship  had  not  been  standing  for  two  years.   The
    representative submitted that when  the  judge  stated  that  paragraph
    276ADE could not be  satisfied  no  reason  was  given  for  this.   At
    paragraph 14 of the determination, in which the  judge  refers  to  the
    Appellant's Article 8 claim, reasons should have  been  given  for  the
    judge's findings.  The judge finds that the requirements of Appendix FM
    have not been satisfied because the income threshold cannot be met, the
    couple is not married and they have not been together  for  two  years.
    The representative submitted that EX.1 must apply and he submitted that
    there are insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant and his  girlfriend
    relocating  to  Pakistan.   The  representative  submitted   that   the
    Respondent is wrong to rely on the case of  Agyarko  as  in  that  case
    neither Appellant had leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  They were
    overstayers and that is not the case here.

 8. The representative referred to the case of Chikwamba submitting that it
    would not be reasonable to expect the Appellant to return to  Pakistan,
    only to make an application to  return  to  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    representative submitted that the insurmountable  obstacles  are,  that
    the Appellant's partner is British and has never been to Pakistan.  She
    works full-time and is dependent on him financing her.  I  put  to  the
    representative that the  Appellant  and  his  wife  both  work  so  the
    Appellant's girlfriend is not dependent on the  Appellant  financially.
    He submitted that they are dependent on each other.   The  evidence  on
    file indicates that the Appellant's girlfriend earns �23,000 per annum.
     The representative then submitted that it would be disproportionate to
    remove the Appellant to Pakistan and that insurmountable  obstacles  is
    too high a test, the test is  reasonableness.   He  submitted  that  it
    should not be necessary for the Appellant's girlfriend to have to go to
    Pakistan with the Appellant to help  him  to  make  an  application  to
    return to the United Kingdom as  a  partner.   He  submitted  that  the
    Appellant will be at risk  in  Pakistan  and  I  was  referred  to  his
    statement.  He submitted that the Judge has not  considered  the  facts
    and the evidence adequately.

 9. The representative submitted that the requirements of paragraph  276ADE
    can be satisfied based on the terms of that paragraph when  the  appeal
    was decided.

10. I put to the representative that a condition  of  paragraph  276ADE  is
    that the Appellant requires to be in  the  United  Kingdom  for  twenty
    years and have no ties to his country of  origin.   The  representative
    submitted that the Appellant has lost his ties to Pakistan  because  of
    his  relationship  with  his  girlfriend.   He   submitted   that   the
    Appellant's ties are now in the United Kingdom.  He  is  employed  here
    and his family and private life are  here.   I  put  to  him  that  his
    parents and the rest of his family are all in Pakistan.   He  submitted
    that the Appellant has fewer connections in Pakistan than in the United
    Kingdom and he has now been in the United Kingdom for  more  than  five
    years and his ties are to his partner.

11. I was asked to find that there is  an  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    determination and that the decision should be set aside.

12. The Presenting Officer made her submissions first of all  referring  to
    Appendix FM of the Rules.  She submitted that at paragraph  14  of  the
    determination when the judge states that paragraph 276ADE and  Appendix
    FM of the Rules cannot be satisfied this is a Robinson  obvious  point.
    When the decision was made the Appellant and  his  girlfriend  had  not
    been cohabiting for two years.  She submitted that as Appendix FM could
    not be satisfied there was no route to EX.1.  She submitted  that  EX.1
    cannot be considered  in  the  circumstances  of  this  claim  and  the
    appellant's application could not have succeeded, even as a fianc�.

13. The Presenting Officer submitted that an application  for  leave  as  a
    partner excludes an in-country  application.   I  was  referred  to  E-
    LRTP.1.12 and she submitted that this is the relevant  section  of  the
    Rules. This Appellant did not obtain entry clearance as the  fianc�  or
    proposed civil partner of a British citizen, he  obtained  entry  as  a
    student.  The  Presenting  Officer  submitted  that  it  is  irrelevant
    whether EX.1 was considered by the judge as the route to  EX.1  is  not
    available in this case.

14. The Presenting Officer submitted that at the date of  the  hearing  the
    financial requirements had not been satisfied as the relevant  evidence
    was not produced.  The terms of  Appendix  FM-SE  were  not  satisfied.
    There were no pay  slips  or  bank  statements  and  nothing  from  the
    Appellant's girlfriend's employer and I was referred to paragraph 2  of
    Appendix FM-SE.

15. She submitted that these documents may have been supplied  in  the  new
    bundle but they were not before the judge.  She submitted that I should
    not give these additional documents  consideration  today  as  this  is
    purely an error of law hearing.

16. The Presenting Officer submitted that even  if  I  find  that  EX.1  is
    applicable the requirement of insurmountable  obstacles  has  not  been
    met.  I was referred  to  paragraph  21  of  Agyarko  which  refers  to
    insurmountable obstacles imposing a high hurdle to be  overcome  by  an
    applicant  for  leave  to  remain  under  the  Rules.   The   test   is
    significantly more demanding than a mere test of whether  it  would  be
    reasonable to expect a couple to continue their family life outside the
    United Kingdom.  She submitted that the reasoning in this paragraph  is
    not fact specific.

17. I was then  referred  to  the  Home  Office's  Immigration  Directorate
    Instruction (IDI) re Family Migration.  This deals with  insurmountable
    obstacles and paragraph FM.  It refers to a  British  citizen  partner,
    (which is the Appellant's girlfriend in this case) who has lived in the
    UK all their life, has friends and family here, works here  and  speaks
    only English, not wishing to uproot and relocate half  way  across  the
    world and it states that it may be difficult for them to do so but  the
    IDI states that a significant degree of hardship or inconvenience  does
    not amount to an insurmountable obstacle and Article 8 of ECHR does not
    oblige the UK to accept the choice of a couple,  as  to  which  country
    they would prefer to reside in.   She  submitted  therefore  that  EX.1
    cannot be satisfied.

18. I was referred to the said case of SS Congo on this point.

19. The Presenting Officer then referred to paragraph 276ADE of the  Rules.
    She submitted that the Appellant has not been in the United Kingdom for
    twenty years and clearly still has ties to Pakistan.  He comes  from  a
    middleclass family there.  His parents work and  in  his  statement  he
    states that he wants to work in  the  United  Kingdom  to  support  his
    family in Pakistan, so paragraph 276ADE cannot be satisfied.

20. The Presenting Officer referred to paragraph 14 of  the  determination.
    She submitted that the judge took the correct approach  when  he  dealt
    with Article 8 outside the Rules which is the only basis on which  this
    claim can succeed.  Paragraph 33 of the said case of SS Congo makes  it
    clear that there must be compelling circumstances for a  claim  outside
    the Rules to succeed.  She submitted that the  proper  approach  is  to
    consider the Article 8 aspect of the Rules and  if  the  terms  of  the
    Rules cannot be satisfied, then Article 8 can be considered outside the
    Rules.  She submitted that the Appellant in this case did  not  have  a
    good arguable case for having his claim considered  outside  the  Rules
    when all the relevant factors were taken into account.  At paragraph 19
    the judge finds there to be no insurmountable obstacles to this  couple
    going to live in Pakistan.  He also finds it would not be  unreasonable
    to  expect  the  Appellant  to  return  to  Pakistan  on  his  own  and
    immediately make an application to return to the United  Kingdom  as  a
    fianc� or spouse.  His girlfriend would not require to go with him.

21. Again the case of Agyarko was referred  to.   Paragraph  24  refers  to
    "insurmountable obstacles", stating that this criterion is used in  the
    Rules to define one of the preconditions set  out  in  Section  EX.1(b)
    which needs to be  satisfied  before  an  applicant  can  claim  to  be
    entitled to a grant of leave to remain under the Rules.  The  paragraph
    goes on to state that in that the context of making a wider  Article  8
    assessment outside the Rules, it is a factor to be taken  into  account
    although not an absolute requirement which has to be satisfied in every
    single case across the whole range of cases covered by Article  8.   At
    paragraph 30 of Agyarko it is stated that "insurmountable obstacles  to
    relocation" has to be taken into account.  It is a material factor  and
    she submitted that  the  judge  has  made  no  error  by  referring  to
    "insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant's family life continuing  in
    Pakistan."

22.  She referred me to paragraphs 18 and 19 of the determination in  which
    the judge refers to private life and to  the  appellant's  relationship
    with a British  citizen.   The  judge  states  that  it  would  not  be
    necessary for the Appellant's girlfriend to go with  the  Appellant  to
    Pakistan while he makes an application  to  return.   The  judge  finds
    there are no insurmountable obstacles in  the  Appellant's  case.   The
    Presenting Officer submitted that the judge has covered all  the  bases
    in his determination.

23. The Presenting Officer then referred to the case of  Hiahong  Chen  IJR
    [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC) and paragraph 39 thereof.  This refers  to  there
    being two requirements under the Chikwamba  principle.   The  Appellant
    has to show that entry clearance abroad would be granted and he has  to
    show that there will be a significant interference to his life and  his
    girlfriend's life if he has to leave the United Kingdom temporarily  to
    make an  application  to  return.   She  submitted  that  the  required
    documents under Appendix FM-SE were not  before  the  judge.   This  in
    effect means that for a  claim  outside  the  Rules  to  be  successful
    compelling circumstances have  to  pertain  to  the  application.   She
    submitted that the case law and the Rules make it clear  that  fairness
    and equality apply to all applicants and in this case the Appellant  is
    looking for  preferential  treatment.   She  submitted  that  there  is
    nothing unusual about this case and preferential treatment  should  not
    be given.  She submitted that as stated by the judge at the  First-tier
    hearing, temporary removal of the Appellant to Pakistan, so that he can
    apply to return to the United Kingdom as a fianc� or partner  does  not
    meet the requirements of compelling circumstances.

24. I was asked to dismiss this appeal.

25. The Appellant's representative referred  to  the  Presenting  Officer's
    reasoning that EX.1 is only applicable if considered after the terms of
    Appendix FM have been satisfied.  He submitted that in this case it  is
    clear that  the  Appellant  and  his  girlfriend  have  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship so EX.1 must apply.  He submitted that if  EX.1
    applies the First-tier judge's decision  must  contain  an  error.   He
    submitted that the cases put forward  by  the  Presenting  Officer  are
    cases in which the Appellants overstayed.  He submitted  that  that  is
    not the case here.  The Appellant came to the United Kingdom on a  visa
    and stayed here within the law.  the representative submitted that  the
    threshold relating to income has now been satisfied and if the case  of
    Chikwamba  is  considered,  to  remove  the  Appellant  would  not   be
    proportionate.  I was referred to the reasonableness  test  and  I  was
    referred to the Home Office IDI.   The  representative  submitted  that
    this is a policy, it is not the law.

26. I was referred to the case of VW Uganda  (2009)  EWCA  Civ  5  and  the
    representative submitted that this Appellant is not an  overstayer  and
    now meets the requirements of the Rules.  He submitted that  there  are
    significant obstacles to him going back to Pakistan and that  the  said
    case of Agyarko is not relevant.

27. I was asked to consider proportionality and find that it would  not  be
    proportionate to expect the Appellant to return to Pakistan.  He has  a
    strong family life with his  partner  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  he
    submitted  that  if  he  is  removed  this  will  be   an   unjustified
    interference with his family and private life.  He again submitted that
    the Appellant has lost his ties with Pakistan and  that  based  on  the
    evidence before me I should find that the terms of Appendix FM  can  be
    satisfied.

28. He submitted that in the new evidence there are P60s for the  Appellant
    and his partner and I was asked to find that  the  judge  has  made  an
    error of law in his determination and that his decision should  be  set
    aside.

Determination

29. This is an error of law hearing.  No Rule 15A application was made  and
    I am not considering  the  additional  evidence  now  supplied  by  the
    Appellant's representative.  I am considering  the  evidence  that  was
    before the judge when he heard the case.

30. EX.1 is not freestanding.  It is true that the judge has not  explained
    why he finds Appendix FM cannot be satisfied and  there  are  no  clear
    reasons in the determination as to what part or parts  of  Appendix  FM
    were not satisfied.  Because of this finding EX.1 was  not  considered.
    The requirements of Appendix FM are that the Appellant and his  partner
    have to  have  been  in  a  relationship  akin  to  marriage  or  civil
    partnership for two years prior to the date of the  application.   That
    is not the case.  The Appellant had not made a  valid  application  for
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a partner.  An application  on
    this basis has to be made out of country. It is  therefore  clear  that
    the terms of Appendix FM could not be satisfied.   The  way  the  judge
    dealt with this may have been an error but it was not a material error.
     As the terms of Appendix FM could not be satisfied EX.1 could  not  be
    considered.

31. With regard to paragraph 276ADE of the Rules again the  judge  did  not
    explain why its terms could not be satisfied but the Appellant has  not
    lived continuously in the United Kingdom  for  at  least  twenty  years
    which is one of the  requirements  of  this  paragraph.  The  Appellant
    clearly has ties to Pakistan. He is in touch with his family there  and
    in his statement he states that he wants to work in the United  Kingdom
    so he can send money to Pakistan to support his  family  and  so  again
    although this may have been an error by the First-tier Judge it was not
    a material error.

32. As the terms of the Immigration Rules could not be satisfied the First-
    tier Judge had to consider Article 8, the Article 8 aspect of the Rules
    and whether Article 8 should be  considered  outside  the  Rules.   The
    First-tier Judge accepted that the Appellant  has  private  and  family
    life in the United Kingdom.  The Appellant's application was made  with
    the wrong  occupation  code  and  the  determination  states  that  the
    Appellant is in the process of submitting a fresh application using the
    correct occupation code.  The judge  therefore  only  had  to  consider
    Article 8.  The judge accepts that there could be difficulties  if  the
    Appellant's partner has to go to stay  with  him  in  Pakistan  but  at
    paragraph 19 the judge refers to the Appellant  returning  to  Pakistan
    himself and making an application to return as a fianc�.  Because there
    is this option he finds that there are no insurmountable  obstacles  to
    the couple's family life continuing.   The  Home  Office  IDI  supports
    this.

33. At paragraph 14 the judge states that he has to consider whether  there
    are good grounds for granting the appellant leave to remain outside the
    Rules.  He refers to paragraph 5A of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 and Section 117B thereof.  Public interest  has  to  be
    considered when proportionality is assessed.   The  representative  has
    mentioned the Chikwamba point however as  the  Appellant  came  to  the
    United Kingdom on a student visa and not as a partner it is clear  that
    he has to return to Pakistan to make an application to  return  to  the
    United Kingdom as a partner, otherwise the Appellant would  be  gaining
    an advantage over other Appellants in the  same  situation.   There  is
    nothing unusual in this situation.  At paragraph 16 the judge refers to
    the maintenance of effective immigration control which of course is  in
    the public interest.

34. The judge accepts that there is  a  genuine  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and his partner.  He notes that  their  relationship  at  the
    date of the application was not of 2 years standing.

35. Based on what was before the judge, the IDI,  the  case  of  Agyarko  &
    Others and the case of Chikwamba the judge's determination does contain
    minor errors of law but none of these are material.   This  is  a  case
    where the relationship began when one of  the  parties  had  precarious
    private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom.   One  of  the  terms  of  the
    appellant's visa was that he had to return to his own country when  the
    visa came to an end.  He had no legitimate expectation of being able to
    remain in the UK. As his being able to stay depended on  him  obtaining
    another visa, his stay in the UK can be described as precarious.

36. Compelling circumstances would have to apply  to  justify  a  grant  of
    leave to remain where the Immigration Rules cannot be satisfied.   That
    is not the case here.  There are no compelling circumstances.

Notice of Decision

37. I find  that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    determination and that his decision must stand.

38. The Appellant's appeal against the refusal of leave to remain under the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8 of ECHR falls to be dismissed.

39. No anonymity direction has been made.
