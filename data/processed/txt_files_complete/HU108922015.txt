                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica who was born on 19 February 1954.
     She entered the United Kingdom on 3 April 1998 as a  visitor.   On  29
    March 2011, she applied for leave to remain but that was refused on  26
    April 2011.  On 21 February 2012, she applied for indefinite  leave  to
    remain but that was refused on 21 June 2012.   However,  the  appellant
    was  granted  discretionary  leave  under  the  Secretary  of   State's
    "Discretionary Leave Policy" ("DLP") contained within the Asylum Policy
    Instructions.  That leave was valid until 20 June 2015.

 2. On 20 July 2015 the appellant made a human rights  application  seeking
    leave to remain on the basis of her family and private life in the  UK.
    In particular, she relied upon her relationship with her adult daughter
    with whom she  claimed  to  live  and  upon  whom  she  claimed  to  be
    dependent.

 3. On 26 October 2015, the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    application for leave under the Immigration Rules, under Art 8  outside
    the Rules and, in addition, refused  to  grant  the  appellant  further
    discretionary leave under the DLP.

The Appellant's Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  O'Brien
    dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 5. The appellant sought permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    essence on the basis that in assessing her Art 8 claim  the  judge  had
    failed properly to consider whether the appellant  was  entitled  to  a
    further grant of discretionary leave under the DLP.

 6. Permission was initially refused by the First-tier Tribunal but  on  14
    December 2016 permission  was  granted  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  (DUTJ
    Taylor).

 7. On 10 January 2017, the Secretary of  State  filed  a  rule  24  notice
    seeking to uphold the judge's decision to dismiss the appeal under  Art
    8.

The Submissions

 8. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Edwards submitted  that  the  judge  had
    failed properly to consider the application of  the  respondent's  DLP.
    That policy, he submitted, stated that a further period of three years'
    discretionary leave should normally be granted unless the circumstances
    prevailing at the time of the original grant of discretionary leave had
    materially  changed.   Mr  Edwards  submitted   that   the   grant   of
    discretionary leave to the appellant was based upon her living with her
    daughter and being dependent upon her.  The evidence  showed  that  she
    was still living with her daughter but the judge had  made  no  finding
    upon that.  Although he had found  that  she  was  now  only  partially
    financially dependent upon her daughter, as she had obtained  part-time
    work, that was not a material change from the time  when  discretionary
    leave was  granted  in  June  2012  when  she  was  wholly  financially
    dependent upon her daughter.  He submitted that, therefore,  the  judge
    had erred in law in assessing the appellant's Art 8  claim  (which  was
    the only ground of appeal) by failing to take into account that she met
    the requirements of the DLP and that a further period of  discretionary
    leave should, in those circumstances, "normally be granted".

 9. Mr Mills, who represented the Secretary  of  State  accepted  that  the
    evidence presented before Judge O'Brien supported a finding  that  both
    the appellant and her daughter continued to  live  together  at  a  new
    address.  However, he submitted that at the  time  discretionary  leave
    was granted in 2012 the appellant was living with her daughter but  she
    was not working and was wholly dependent on her daughter.  Even if  the
    judge had not made a finding on whether they were living together,  the
    policy  did  not  apply  because  there  was  a  material   change   of
    circumstances.  The  fact  that  the  appellant  was  now  working  and
    therefore was not wholly dependent upon her daughter was  a  "material"
    change of circumstances such that the  DLP  did  not  apply.   He  also
    pointed out that in her witness statement at para 6 the  appellant  now
    stated that her daughter had stopped working in order to look after her
    third child.

10. In those circumstances, Mr Mills submitted there had been a  change  of
    circumstances; the DLP did not apply and the judge had correctly looked
    at the application of the Rules and Article 8 outside the Rules and had
    been entitled to dismiss the appeal.

Discussion

11. It was common ground between the parties that the relevant DLP was  set
    out in section 10 of the Asylum Policy Instructions dated  August  2015
    at section 10.1 which is as follows:

         "10.1 Applicants granted DL before 9 July 2012

         Those granted leave under the DL policy in force before 9 July 2012
         will normally continue to be dealt with under that  policy  through
         to settlement if they continue to qualify for further leave on  the
         same basis as their original DL was granted (normally they will  be
         eligible to apply for settlement after accruing 6 years' continuous
         DL (or where appropriate a combination of DL and LOTR, see  section
         8 above)), unless at the date of  decision  they  fall  within  the
         restricted leave policy.

         Caseworkers must consider whether the circumstances  prevailing  at
         the time of the original grant of leave continue at the date of the
         decision.  If the circumstances remain  the  same,  the  individual
         does  not  fall  within  the  restricted  leave  policy   and   the
         criminality thresholds do not apply a further period of 3 years' DL
         should normally be  granted.   Caseworkers  must  consider  whether
         there  any  circumstances  that  may  warrant  departure  from  the
         standard period of leave.  See section 5.4.

         If there have been significant changes that mean the  applicant  no
         longer qualifies for leave under the DL  policy  or  the  applicant
         falls for refusal on the basis of criminality (see criminality  and
         exclusion section above), the further leave application  should  be
         refused."

12. In her decision, the Secretary of State considered the  application  of
    the policy and concluded that it did not apply in the following terms.

         "Discretionary leave

         On 21 June 2012 you were granted discretionary leave to  remain  in
         the United Kingdom, under Article 8 European  Convention  on  Human
         Rights, on the basis that you were  living  in  the  UK  with  your
         daughter and was dependant on her.  It has been noted that  you  no
         longer reside with your daughter and are living  independently  and
         you are able to financially  support  yourself.   Therefore,  after
         carefully  reviewing  your  application  for   active   review   of
         discretionary leave, the Secretary of State is not  satisfied  that
         the grounds under which you were previously  granted  discretionary
         leave still persist and your application for further  discretionary
         leave is refused."

13. Mr Mills concedes that, on the evidence before the judge, the appellant
    had established that she had moved with her daughter to a new  address.
    Mr Edwards submitted that the judge had failed to  make  a  finding  on
    that issue.

14. In his determination, the judge set out the relevant evidence about the
    living arrangements of the appellant and her daughter  at  para  10  as
    follows:

         "The Appellant's daughter,  Annette  Andrea  Fyle,  said  that  her
         mother had lived with her since arriving from  Jamaica.   They  had
         previously lived at 20 Willow House, Bristol until moving  3  years
         ago to the present address.  She confirmed that she paid  the  rent
         and that her mother contributed ï¿½200 a month."

15. In reaching his findings in respect of the policy the judge  said  this
    at para 22:

         "The  Appellant   appeals   against   the   Respondent's   decision
         principally on the basis that the Respondent has failed properly to
         exercise his discretion.  Of course, such a ground of appeal is  no
         longer available to  the  Appellant;  however,  in  any  event  the
         circumstances  present  at  the  date  of  the  earlier  grant   of
         discretionary leave to remain no longer subsist.  The appellant  is
         now in  a  part-time  employment  and  is  not,  therefore,  wholly
         dependent on her daughter."

16. Whilst the judge made no reference to whether  the  appellant  and  her
    daughter were living together, it is palpably clear  that  he  accepted
    that they were living together.   It  was  part  of  the  Secretary  of
    State's case, as set out in  her  decision  letter,  that  one  of  the
    material changes in  circumstances  was  that  the  appellant  and  her
    daughter were  no  longer  living  together.   Judge  O'Brien  made  no
    reference to that as being a basis for his decision that the  appellant
    could not demonstrate  she  met  the  requirements  of  the  DLP.   His
    reasoning  was  based  rather  upon  a  change  in  the  scope  of  the
    appellant's dependency upon her daughter.  Consequently,  I  reject  Mr
    Edwards' submission that the judge erred in law by failing to  make  an
    explicit finding (which is implicit in his reasoning)  on  whether  the
    appellant and her daughter were still living together.

17. In any event, even if that were an  error,  it  is  immaterial  to  the
    judge's finding that the appellant cannot take advantage  of  the  DLP.
    The original grant of discretionary leave was based, in part, upon  the
    appellant being wholly financially dependent upon her daughter.  As the
    judge found in para 22, the appellant was now  employed  part-time  and
    was no longer "wholly dependent on her daughter".  That was a  material
    change in the circumstances since the initial  grant  of  discretionary
    leave.  Mr Edwards placed some reliance upon  the  judge's  finding  in
    para 29, when considering s.117B(3) of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 that the appellant was "not  financially  independent".
    That is entirely consistent with the judge's finding in  para  22  that
    the appellant is no longer  "wholly  dependent"  on  her  daughter.   I
    accept that in order to establish a material change  of  circumstances,
    such that the DLP would not apply, it was not necessary to  demonstrate
    that the appellant who was once "wholly dependent"  upon  her  daughter
    was   now   'wholly   independent'   financially   of   her   daughter.
    Nevertheless, there was a change in circumstances from  total  to  only
    partial dependence.  It was open to the judge to find that  given  that
    change in the appellant's financial circumstances, namely that she  was
    in part-time employment and no longer  wholly  reliant  upon  financial
    support from her daughter that there  was  a  material  or  significant
    change  in  the  circumstances  from   those   which   prevailed   when
    discretionary leave was initially granted in June 2012.

18.  Consequently,  although  Judge  O'Brien's  reasoning  in  para  22  is
    relatively brief, his  findings  were  properly  open  to  him  on  the
    evidence and he was entitled to find that the  DLP  no  longer  applied
    because of the change in the appellant's circumstances.

19. Mr Edwards did not seek to challenge the  judge's  findings  under  the
    Rules or under Art 8 outside the Rules if he had correctly  found  that
    the DLP did not apply.

20. Consequently, for the above reasons the judge did not  err  in  law  in
    dismissing the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.

Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under Art 8 did not involve the making of an error of  law  and,
    therefore, stands.

22. The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed
