Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Farooq (Sponsor)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless I  shall  refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    described before the First-tier Tribunal, that is Mrs  Naghmana  Farooq
    as the appellant and the Entry Clearance Officer as the respondent.

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer applied for permission  to  appeal  against
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Randall  who  dismissed  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules but  allowed  the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds.  The appellant failed to provide the required financial
    evidence in accordance with the FM-SE  and  thus  the  application  was
    refused under the Rules.  That conclusion did not appear to be disputed
    at paragraph 21 of the decision.  The Presenting Officer  conceded  the
    genuineness of the relationship and therefore that  was  no  longer  an
    issue.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed the appeal  however  pursuant  to
    Article 8 on the basis that it would be  disproportionate  interference
    with the appellant's family life and it was submitted  that  the  judge
    had erred in the following ways:

    Ground (i),  although  the  judge  accepted  the  requirements  of  the
    financial requirements were not satisfied under the Immigration  Rules,
    the  judge  failed  to  have  due  regard  to  the  importance  of  the
    requirements contained therein at paragraph 29.   The  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE  do  not  provide  a  "general  gloss"  but  are  strict
    requirements imposed to be met.  The required level of income could not
    as a matter of fact be demonstrated.  The Court of Appeal in SS Congo v
    SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 317  reiterated  that  there  was  no  distinction
    between the weight to be afforded to Appendix FM-SE and the substantive
    Rules and that could be seen from paragraph 51.

 4. The only "compelling circumstance" identified by the Tribunal  was  the
    financial dependency of the sponsor's parents in Pakistan.  It was said
    that if the sponsor was to relocate that would cease (see paragraphs 27
    and 29).  The respondent submitted that the Tribunal was misdirected in
    its appraisal of the compelling circumstances.

 5. There was no adequate reason given for establishing  that  the  sponsor
    could not gain any employment in the country where both  his  wife  and
    parents resided and where he  retained  a  significant  nexus.   Simply
    because he had lived in Abu Dhabi does not mean  he  could  not  pursue
    employment in Pakistan and had shown that he integrated into Pakistan.

 6. The judge had failed to consider why the appellant  should  be  treated
    more favourably than other applicants and had  not  identified  a  good
    reason for permitting more preferential treatment.

 7.  Indeed,  should  the  appellant  think  their  ability  to  meet   the
    requirements of the Rules had improved, there  was  no  reason  why  it
    should not be disproportionate for another application to made  in  the
    future, see paragraph 57 of SS (Congo).

 8. In essence no compelling circumstances had been identified.

 9. At the hearing before me Mr Nath relied on the grounds.

10. The sponsor attended and gave oral testimony that he was an eBay seller
    and that he now earned approximately ï¿½40,000 per  year  and  could  not
    return to Pakistan because there was no eBay or PayPal platform  there.
    He had been told he could do it online but that would  not  afford  him
    sufficient income and it was not possible for him to print and  package
    goods.

11. He confirmed that he had  lived  in  Abu  Dhabi  but  had  returned  to
    Pakistan in 1996 and then entered the UK  as  a  student  in  2004  and
    achieved a  business  administration  degree  and  thereafter  in  2008
    started working at Metro Properties Limited.  In 2014  he  married  his
    wife in Pakistan.

12. He  was  specifically  asked  why  his  wife  could  not  make  another
    application and he said at present it was difficult for her to  do  the
    IELTS exams as she was pregnant but she should be able to undertake the
    exams once her pregnancy was over, which would be in October.  She  had
    previously undertaken and  passed  an  IELTS  exam  in  2015  but  that
    certificate had now expired.  The sponsor confirmed that his wife lived
    with his parents and brother and they supported her and took her to the
    doctors.  The difficulty would be taking the exam which was  200  miles
    away, but that would be possible in the future.  He  also  stated  that
    his child was a British citizen child and he would like  the  child  to
    come to the UK and live as a family unit.

13. I have no hesitation in concluding that there was an error  of  law  in
    the judge's decision.  It was quite clear  that  at  paragraph  21  the
    judge  found  that  the  appellant  and  sponsor  did  not  fulfil  the
    requirements of Appendix FM.  As pointed out by the  judge  himself  at
    paragraph 22:

         "It was and is of course open to the appellant to apply  for  entry
         clearance again relying on the sponsor's present  income  over  the
         most  recent  six  months,  this  time  properly  evidenced.    The
         application  would,  in  all  likelihood,  be  bolstered   by   the
         respondent's concession as to the genuineness of  the  relationship
         and the existence of the child's couple.  However the appellant has
         chosen, as is her right, to press on with this appeal".

14. The judge did not appear to factor that finding into his  determination
    when addressing the elements under human rights.

15. I further notice that there was passing reference to  Section  117  and
    although that was not pleaded in the grounds it is a clear  error  that
    Section 117, having found that the financial requirements have not been
    made out, that it is not applied in relation to whether  the  appellant
    would be financially independent on entry into the UK.

16. It may be that there was a significant interference for the entitlement
    to respect for family life because  the  financial  arrangements  meant
    that it was difficult for the sponsor to travel to Pakistan  more  than
    once a year, but as pointed out in SS (Congo) at paragraph 82,  Article
    8 does not give rise to an obligation on the  state  to  accommodate  a
    preference to pursue family life in  the  United  Kingdom  rather  than
    overseas.

17. The judge at paragraph 29 states that he had regard to the decision  in
    SS (Congo) that there must be very compelling circumstances, but merely
    states that the sponsor's obligations to support his  wider  family  in
    Pakistan meant there was no  prospect  of  the  couple  enjoying  their
    family life in Pakistan and he must remain here to generate the  income
    to support them.  The judge factored in that the sponsor now  did  have
    sufficient  funds  to  support  his  wife   and   that   the   proposed
    accommodation was not called into question.

18. What the judge does not do is factor in that the appellant's  wife  can
    make a further application.  The failure to comply with paragraph FM-SE
    is not just  a  technical  failure  but  an  important  aspect  of  the
    Immigration Rules namely financial independence from being a burden  on
    public funds.

19. There has been an acceptance by the Entry Clearance  Officer  that  the
    relationship is genuine. I accept that there is a genuine  relationship
    between the sponsor and his wife and child and Article 8 is engaged but
    the decision was made for a legitimate purpose and in  accordance  with
    the law.  The Supreme Court has upheld the financial requirements under
    the Immigration Rules as being lawful.

20. In my view there are no compelling  factors  leading  to  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences in this case. Section 55 of the Borders  Citizenship
    and Immigration Act 2009 does not apply to children overseas but I have
    nevertheless considered the best interests of the child,  which  is  to
    remain with the mother in the status quo, with the  assistance  of  the
    family in Pakistan until secure financial arrangements can be made  for
    the family to relocate. I am  obliged  to  apply  Section  117  of  the
    Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  and   this   includes
    consideration of whether the family would be  financially  independent.
    To  date  the  financial  documentation  has  not  been  accepted  but,
    according to the sponsor can be provided for verification.   I note the
    existing child is a British citizen but there is nothing to prevent the
    child from entering the UK, if so desired by the parents.  The  sponsor
    also told me that once the second  child  is  born  that  it  would  be
    possible for the  appellant  to  take  the  English  language  test  as
    required.  She has already passed the test which has expired.

21. In evidence the sponsor explained that  his  real  difficulty  was  the
    delay, which although the husband and wife  have  been  separated  they
    would have, at the outset, appreciated that there are Immigration Rules
    with  which  they  should  comply.  Article  8  does  not  afford   the
    opportunity to foreign nationals simply to  choose  where  to  exercise
    their family life. The wife is being supported at present and there  is
    no reason why an application cannot be  resolved  within  a  matter  of
    months, although clearly I cannot anticipate the success or  otherwise.



22. As advanced in SS (Congo) it is open to the appellant to make a further
    application and indeed in the evidence given to me in the hearing, when
    I indicated that an error of law, the  sponsor  told  me  that  it  was
    clearly possible for him to support his  wife  and  she  could  make  a
    further application and that he now had the  financial  resources  with
    which to pursue and secure  her  application.   The  Immigration  Rules
    clearly set out the position of the Secretary  of  State  and  applying
    Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11,   I am  not  persuaded  that  the  refusal
    decision is disproportionate in all the circumstances.

23. I therefore find an error of law, set aside that decision and  for  the
    reasons given above remake it dismissing  the  appeal  both  under  the
    Immigration Rules and under Article 8.







Decision

The appeal of Mrs N Farooq is dismissed under the Immigration Rules  and  on
Article 8 grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
