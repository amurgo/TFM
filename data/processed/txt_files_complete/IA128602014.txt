For the Appellant:     Mr Sellwood, Counsel instructed by Ozkutan
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Vidyadharan, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge E.B. Grant sitting at  Hatton  Cross  on  13
    October 2014) dismissing his appeal against the decision by the SSHD to
    refuse to grant him ILR as a self-employed businessman under the Ankara
    Agreement. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction,
    and I do not consider that the appellant requires anonymity  for  these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The ground of refusal was that the appellant had not shown that he  had
    genuinely established a business with his  partner  as  the  owner  and
    manager of Eroma Caf� through a company called UM & KO Eroma Ltd, or  a
    parallel property management business managing the  three  flats  above
    the caf� under the auspices of UM & KO  Property  Ltd.  The  respondent
    disputed that  the  companies  had  acquired  legal  ownership  of  the
    premises or the caf� business, and  she  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant's  part  of  the  business  did  not  amount   to   disguised
    employment.

 3. In her typed record of proceedings, Judge Grant observed that  the  two
    bundles of evidence served by the appellant's solicitors were the  size
    of two telephone directories, and she asked Miss Daykin of  Counsel  to
    mark up the relevant documents.

 4. In her subsequent decision, Judge Grant found that the concerns  raised
    by the SSHD had not been adequately addressed, and  the  appellant  had
    not discharged the burden of proving that he met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 21 of HC 510.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 5. On 12 December 2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  J  M  Holmes  granted
    permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         The decision makes no reference to the decision in EK Turkey [2010]
         UKUT 425,  although  this  was  relied  upon  by  Counsel  for  the
         appellant,  and  arguably  was  based  on  very   similar   factual
         circumstances.  Arguably,  had  the  judge  followed  the  guidance
         therein she would have allowed the appeal under paragraph 28 of  HC
         510.

         Moreover it is arguable the judge's approach to the evidence was so
         flawed as to amount to a material error of law.  Rather  than  use,
         or comment upon, the analysis of payments towards  payment  of  the
         purchase price of the  leasehold  evidence  and  the  documents  in
         evidence compiled by  the  appellant's  Counsel  and  confirmed  in
         evidence by the appellant, the  judge  appears  to  have  tried  to
         prepare her own computation after the hearing.   Arguably  she  has
         erred in doing so, because she has omitted relevant  payments,  and
         included irrelevant payments in her calculation, and has given  the
         appellant  no  opportunity  to  correct,  or  comment   upon,   her
         calculation.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

 6. For the purposes of the hearing in the Upper Tribunal  the  appellant's
    solicitors filed a notice pursuant  to  Rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  asking  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    consider evidence that was not before the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. The new evidence included a  deed  of  assignment  and  a  letter  from
    Barclays Bank confirming  that  the  appellant  and  his  partner  were
    signatories to the company bank account.  The assignment made  on  19th
    January 2015 was between Veyis Acil (assignor) of the one part, and the
    appellant and his partner (the assignees) of the other  part.   In  the
    preamble, the assignor  is  described  as  "now  carrying  on  and  has
    hitherto carried on in or upon the premises" the  business  of  a  caf�
    known as Eroma.  The preamble further states the  assignor  had  agreed
    with the assignees for the sale to them the goodwill  of  the  business
    for the price of �60,000.

 8. Mr Sellwood agreed that proof that the appellant was a signatory to the
    business bank  account  could  have  been  provided  earlier.   But  he
    submitted that it was not a requirement of the relevant Rule that  such
    evidence be provided.

 9. I pointed out that the implication of the deed of assignment now sought
    to be relied on pursuant to Rule 15(2A) was that hitherto the  business
    of the caf� had been carried on by the assignor, Mr Acil,  not  by  the
    appellant and his business partner.  Mr Sellwood said that the preamble
    was not factually correct.

10. I reviewed the documents that had been before the  judge.   It  emerged
    that there was a discrepancy  between  the  appellant's  bundle  in  Mr
    Sellwood's possession, and the appellant's bundles  in  my  file.   The
    appellant's bundle in Mr Sellwood's possession combined the two bundles
    referred to by the judge into one single giant bundle (over  800  pages
    long), and it had different coloured flags to show  different  sets  of
    transactions.  The transactions highlighted in bold  in  the  one  page
    schedule referred to by Miss Daykin at the hearing had been flagged  up
    in Mr Sellwood's bundle.  But it not been flagged  up  in  the  judge's
    (second) appellant's bundle which ran from pages 609 onwards.  The only
    transactions which had apparently been highlighted  for  the  judge  by
    purple post-it notes were the payments to Mr Kershaw,  the  freeholder,
    for rent.

11. I then reviewed the documents which were cross-referenced  in  the  one
    page schedule relied on as showing payments towards the purchase of the
    lease.  Most of the transactions relied on were debits from  a  company
    bank account, and they did not detail the purpose for which  the  money
    was being paid to either Mr Acil or his brother.

12. Mr Sellwood submitted that this did not matter, as the  appellant  only
    needed to show on the balance of probabilities that he was and had been
    genuinely in business at the date of the hearing before the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

13. Ms Vidyadharan submitted that there had been no material error  on  the
    part of the judge, who had been misdirected by  Counsel  to  the  wrong
    evidence.  Furthermore, the evidence in support of the alleged payments
    towards the lease was equivocal.

Discussion

14. Paragraph 28 of the 1973 Rules provides as follows:

         A person who is admitted in the first instance for a limited period
         and has remained here for four years in approved  employment  or  a
         businessman or a self-employed person or is a person of independent
         means may have the time limit on his stay removed unless there  are
         grounds for maintaining it.  Applications for removal of  the  time
         limit are to be  considered  in  the  light  of  all  the  relevant
         circumstances including those set out in paragraph 4.

15. In the EK (Ankara Agreement - 1972 Rules - construction) Turkey  [2010]
    UKUT 425 (IAC) the Tribunal held that paragraph 28 of HC 510  does  not
    require a  person  who  had  been  given  leave  as  a  businessman  to
    demonstrate as a precondition of the exercise  of  discretion  that  in
    each or any year in which they have been given leave in  that  capacity
    they have complied with particular requirements of paragraph 21.  Those
    requirements are directly relevant only to the  first  application  for
    permission to remain or the first extension of stay.

16. At paragraph 24 of EK the Tribunal said:

         We would accept the submission that in an extreme  case  where  the
         evidence demonstrates that the business for which the applicant had
         been given permission to remain was completely dormant or generated
         such marginal funds as to be incapable of supporting anybody in the
         United Kingdom, the Home Office might well be able to identify that
         consideration as a  highly  relevant  factor  to  the  exercise  of
         discretion to grant or refuse indefinite leave to remain.   Such  a
         decision would not be expressed in terms of failing  to  satisfy  a
         requirement of the Rules but the  identification  of  a  particular
         factor why discretion to grant indefinite leave was not  considered
         appropriate.  In such case on  appeal  it  would  be  open  to  the
         Immigration Judge  to  see  whether  discretion  should  have  been
         exercised differently in all the circumstances  of  the  case.   In
         recognising this, a pragmatic application  of  the  principles  and
         Rules is called for.  It was certainly the case in 1972 and  for  a
         number  of  years  thereafter  the  Home  Office  recognised   that
         businesses often needed some sign to turn a profit  and  losses  in
         the early years were not inconsistent with a business that met  the
         policy and purposes of the Rules in general.  The case  was  always
         considered in the round.  In cases of doubt a further extension  of
         limited leave was often given.

17. Although the grounds  of  refusal  of  the  application  for  ILR  were
    presented in terms of a failure to meet two particular requirements  of
    paragraph 21, on analysis the Secretary of  State  was  postulating  an
    extreme case as envisaged in paragraph 24  of  EK.   The  business  for
    which  the  appellant  had  been  given  permission   to   remain   had
    disintegrated, and it was not accepted by the Secretary of  State  that
    the appellant had genuinely established a new business in  substitution
    for the old one.  Since this was the  nature  of  the  factual  dispute
    between the parties, I do not consider the judge's  failure  to  direct
    herself by reference to paragraph  28  (rather  than  by  reference  to
    paragraph 21) was material.

18. Turning to the other error of law challenge, I find that the judge made
    an understandable mistake of fact.  Her mistake  is  understandable  as
    she had been provided with over 800 pages of documents, most  of  which
    did not speak for themselves.   I  have  no  doubt  that  the  mass  of
    documentation was compiled and presented in good  faith,  but  the  net
    result  was  to  a   significant   degree   obfuscatory   rather   than
    illuminating.  The judge was not assisted by  only  having  the  rental
    payments flagged up in the first bundle which ran to  over  600  pages;
    whereas the key documents in the second bundle relied on as  evidencing
    payments towards the purchase of the lease were not flagged up for  the
    judge.

19.  Nonetheless,  it  is  apparent  from  the  judge's  typed  Record   of
    Proceedings that she had the one page schedule relied on by Counsel  as
    tabulating the payments that had been made towards the purchase of  the
    lease; and this document had cross-references to pages  in  the  second
    bundle.  So, contrary to the  judge's  finding  in  paragraph  11,  the
    appellant had in fact provided documents to support his claim  that  he
    and his partner had made payments towards the purchase of the lease  of
    the business premises from the leaseholder Mr Acil.

20. The more difficult question is whether the judge's mistake of  fact  on
    this question translates into a  material  error  of  law.   While  the
    perceived lack of supporting documentary evidence for  this  aspect  of
    the appellant's claim undoubtedly coloured  the  judge's  view  of  the
    appellant's general credibility, it was not the only ground upon  which
    she found against him.

21. Firstly, there was a simple point relied on by the  respondent  in  the
    refusal letter, and echoed by the judge, that  the  appellant  and  his
    business partner did not actually own the premises where the  caf�  was
    located, and were not actually the owners of  the  business  which  was
    carried on at the caf�.  I do not understand this to  be  disputed.  In
    essence, the appellant's case was that he was carrying on the  business
    of a caf� owner at the premises, and had been doing so for three years,
    although the formal transfer of the business, and the formal assignment
    of the leasehold of the premises, had not yet taken place  because  the
    appellant and his partner had not yet paid over all the money  required
    - but in the case of the lease, they were now only about  �5,000  short
    of the price demanded. The respondent's argument, which it was open  to
    the judge to accept, was that the appellant could  not  be  treated  as
    having established a business of which neither he (nor the  company  of
    which he was a director) was the legal owner.

22. Secondly, it was open to the judge to place considerable weight on  the
    absence of any confirmatory evidence as to who controlled  the  company
    bank accounts. A confirmatory letter from Barclays Bank to this  effect
    had been requested by the Home Office on  11  February  2014,  and  the
    respondent had placed great stock on its non-production in the  refusal
    letter.  So the fact  that  the  appellant  had  served  a  tsunami  of
    evidence by way of appeal which did not include  the  requested  letter
    from Barclays Bank was calculated to increase suspicion, not  to  allay
    it.

23. Thirdly, the judge was not in fact wrong when she said in paragraph  15
    that the financial evidence placed before her did not demonstrate  that
    the appellant had made part payments for the  business.   The  schedule
    relied on by Miss Daykin of Counsel related  to  the  purchase  of  the
    lease, not to the purchase of the goodwill in  the  business  which  is
    covered by the deed of assignment signed in January 2014.  I note  that
    the purchase price for the sale of the  goodwill  in  the  business  is
    �60,000, whereas the schedule relied on by Miss Daykin cross-refers  to
    documentary evidence of the  payment  of  monies  with  regard  to  the
    purchase of the lease at a price of �100,000. So there are two entirely
    different transactions, for which  the  total  bill  is  �160,000,  not
    �100,000.

24. Moreover, as I canvassed with the parties at the hearing, while it  can
    be seen in the bank statements that there are debits in  favour  of  Mr
    Acil or his brother, the bank  statements  entries  do  not  state  the
    purpose for which monies from the company bank account are  being  paid
    over to these individuals.

25. The case of the respondent was not that there was no business going  on
    at the premises, but that the appellant  had  not  shown  that  he  was
    running the business or that he was the owner  of  it;  as  opposed  to
    being under the  direction  and  control  of  Mr  Acil  and/or  another
    unidentified person.  The appellant's account in his oral  evidence  of
    what he did on a day-to-day  basis  is  entirely  consistent  with  the
    respondent's characterisation of him as being in  disguised  employment
    under the direction of Mr Acil.

26. I accept that overall the evidence sought  to  be  adduced  under  Rule
    15(2A) advances the appellant's case. (The  one  respect  in  which  it
    undermines it is that the deed of assignment refers to Mr Acil carrying
    on the business of the caf� at the date of  the  assignment,  which  is
    inconsistent with the proposition that the appellant  and  his  partner
    took over the running of the business from Mr Acil  three  years  ago.)
    But, as Mr Sellwood acknowledged, in order to rely on the new  evidence
    as bolstering his case in this appeal (as opposed to being  constrained
    to rely on such evidence in a fresh application for ILR), the appellant
    needs first to establish that there was  procedural  unfairness  or  an
    error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  such  that  it
    should be set aside and remade.

27. On the evidence that was made available to the First-tier  Tribunal,  I
    find that the judge has  given  adequate  reasons  for  dismissing  the
    appeal, and her mistake in confusing the documentary evidence  relating
    to rental payments with the documentary evidence relating  to  payments
    towards the purchase of the lease was not material.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
