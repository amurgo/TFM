                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:     Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mozhgan Dokoohaki, date of birth 2.2.88, is a citizen of
    Iran.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Burns promulgated 24.2.15, dismissing her appeal against the  decisions
    of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  8.12.14,  to  refuse  her  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights appeals and to remove her from
    the UK by way of directions under the Immigration Act 1971.  The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 9.2.15.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Baker  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.3.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 30.7.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. However, Mr McVeety informed the tribunal that on 19.5.15 the appellant
    has left the UK and returned to Iran under  the  Home  Office  assisted
    return policy.

 6. It follows that  pursuant  to  section  104(4)  of  the  2002  Act  and
    paragraph 17A of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008,
    the appellant's appeal must be treated as abandoned  by  her  departure
    from the UK and the Tribunal  must  therefore  send  a  notice  to  the
    parties informing them accordingly.

 7. I therefore find that there is no valid or extant appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal that can be decided.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
