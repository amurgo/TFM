                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

The appellant in this appeal will be referred to as the Secretary of State
throughout this decision and reasons and the respondent is referred to as
the claimant.

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of Judge of
the First-tier Tribunal Dilks ('the Judge') sent to the parties on 21
October 2019 by which the claimant's appeal against the decision not to
allow her to remain in the United Kingdom was allowed on human rights
(article 8) grounds. The claimant's appeal on international protection and
human rights (article 3) grounds was dismissed by the Judge.

Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Manuell granted the Secretary
of State permission to appeal on all grounds.

Anonymity

The Judge issued an anonymity direction and neither representative
requested that it be set aside. The direction is confirmed at the
conclusion of this decision.

Background

The claimant is a national of Somalia and is presently aged 69. She entered
the United Kingdom on 12 October 2015 using a false passport and claimed
asylum on 6 November 2015. The Secretary of State refused her application
for international protection by a decision dated 29 April 2016 and the
claimant's appeal was subsequently dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal by
means of a decision dated 30 January 2017 (PA/09520/2016). Judge of the
First-tier Tribunal Brunnen accepted that the appellant had previously been
an MP in the Transitional Government of Somalia and had continued to be
active in civil society, particularly in seeking to promote the interests
of women. Judge Brunnen found that at the time of the appeal the claimant
did not enjoy such profile as to be targeted following her retirement into
private life and so dismissed her international protection appeal. The
medical evidence before Judge Brunnen identified that the claimant was
'approaching' end-stage renal failure. Judge Brunnen determined as to the
article 3 appeal:

         'The evidence in the present case does not deal with the
         availability in Mogadishu of treatment appropriate to the
         appellant's needs or her ability to obtain such treatment. Further,
         it does not deal with the consequences of her being without
         treatment. Without evidence on these issues I cannot find that the
         circumstances described in Paposhvili apply to her. In the absence
         of such evidence, she cannot succeed under article 3 on the basis
         of her illness.'

The claimant submitted further representations on 23 March 2019 which were
accepted by the Secretary of State to constitute a fresh claim for the
purpose of paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules. The respondent refused
to grant the claimant leave to remain in this country by way of a decision
dated 25 June 2019, which is the subject of this appeal.

Hearing before the FtT

The appeal came before the Judge sitting in Manchester on 11 October 2019.
She accepted that the claimant engaged in sur place political activities in
the United Kingdom as a member of MNDE but determined that the claimant
would not be considered to be anything other than an ordinary civilian on
return to Somalia with no connection to the security forces, any aspect of
government or official administration or to any NGO or international
organisation. The Judge concluded as to the international protection claim:

         '57. Having found that the appellant would be 'an ordinary
             civilian' on return, I consider that all of the other issues
             on return were considered by Tribunal Judge Brunnen. There is
             no evidence to show that the appellant has any close relatives
             in Mogadishu. In view of her age and poor health, Tribunal
             Judge Brennen considered that it was unlikely that the
             appellant would be able to support herself from employment or
             self-employment. However, having been chosen by the Rahanweyn
             as one of their representatives, and having worked on their
             behalf for many years, Tribunal Judge Brunnen considered it
             highly likely that she would be able to draw on her clan
             associations for assistance. With regard to the passage of
             time since Tribunal Judge Brunnen's decision I consider that
             even though it is now nearly 5 years since the appellant left
             Somalia, given what is accepted about the work that she did
             for her clan, I find it reasonably likely that she would still
             have this clan support. Similar, although it is now nearly 5
             years since she left Somalia in December 2014, I find that the
             position is as found by Tribunal Judge Brunnen that the
             appellant will not have lost touch with its culture or lost
             her ability to speak the indigenous languages. For these
             reasons I find as Tribunal Judge Brunnen that the appellant
             has not shown that she could not re-establish herself as an
             ordinary citizen in Mogadishu.

         58.  With regard to the principles in HJ (Iran) and the issues
             raised in the appellant's witness statement at paragraph 15, I
             have find (sic) that the activities she has taken part in as
             part of the MNDE group do not put her at risk on return to
             Somalia taking into account the country guidance in the case
             of MOJ and therefore I find that even if she does continue
             with these activities on return to Somalia then this would not
             put her at risk of persecution.'

The claimant has not cross-appealed this element of the Judge's decision.

In considering the article 3 claim before her based upon the claimant's
medical condition, the Judge observed objective evidence placed before her
that confirmed a centre for kidney dialysis has been operative in Mogadishu
since 2015. The Judge further noted medical evidence confirming that the
claimant suffers from end-stage renal failure and receives dialysis
treatment three times a week. Medical evidence confirms that the claimant
is required to continue with such treatment on a long-term basis until she
receives a kidney transplant. In dismissing the article 3 appeal the Judge
determined:

         '70. The Upper Tribunal has decided in EA & Ors (Article 3 medical
             cases - Paposhvili not applicable) [2017] UKUT 445 that the
             test in Paposhvili was not a test that it was open to the
             tribunal to apply by reason of its being contrary to judicial
             precedent of GS (India).  In SSHD v PF (Nigeria) [2019] EWCA
             Civ 1139 the Court of Appeal have further commented that N is
             still binding authority to Supreme Court level. In N [2005]
             UKHL 31 the Court of Appeal said that the test in this sort of
             case was whether the claimant's medical condition had reached
             such a critical stage (i.e. the claimant was dying) that there
             were compelling humanitarian grounds for not removing him to a
             place which lacked the medical and social services which he
             would need to prevent acute suffering while he was dying. The
             fact that he would be deprived of medical treatment which
             would otherwise prolong his life is not the main
             consideration.

         71.  I find that there is no material change in the appellant's
             medical condition since the determination on 30 January 2017
             but the Court of Appeal has since confirmed that the test in
             Paposhvili is not a test that is open to the tribunal to
             apply. The letter from Professor Mitra dated 9 April 2019
             confirms that the appellant currently remains well and that
             she does feel tired after dialysis but is otherwise self-
             caring and independent and I find that the appellant is not at
             such a critical stage as envisaged in N and that the appellant
             cannot succeed under article 3 on the basis of her illness.'

The Judge allowed the appeal on article 8 grounds determining:

         '77. Mr Ashu submitted that the appellant would need to pay for her
             dialysis. I have no evidence before me on the likely cost of
             the dialysis treatment three times a week. Mr McBride
             submitted that the treatment may be expensive, that we don't
             know, but importantly it was available. It may be possible to
             have dialysis in Mogadishu, but I need to consider whether it
             is likely that the appellant would be able to access this. The
             information handed to me by Mr Ashu from Wikipedia on
             healthcare in Somalia starts with the statement that;
             'Healthcare in Somalia is largely in the private sector'. I
             note that he information in paragraph 92 of the asylum
             decision does not include information relating to whether the
             appellant would have to pay privately for this treatment
             although it does say that 'in the past only the wealthy with
             the financial means to travel abroad were able to seek
             treatment.

         78.  Given the information before me I find it is likely that the
             appellant would be required to pay for her treatment in
             Somalia. The appellant could avail herself of the assisted
             voluntary return scheme but as Mr McBride stated this would
             only assist her in the short term.

         79.  Beyond that it was found by Tribunal Judge Brunnen that the
             appellant would have clan support but the headnote to MOJ
             states that; '...Clans now provide, potentially, social
             support mechanisms and assist with access to livelihoods...'
             Whilst the appellant's clan may provide the necessary support
             for her to live in Mogadishu, I find it is unlikely that this
             support would extend to funding the cost of weekly dialysis
             for the appellant.

         80.  By an asylum support decision dated 28 May 2019 the appellant
             has been found to be destitute.  I accept from this that it is
             unlikely that the appellant's family would be able to support
             her in Mogadishu. The appellant's evidence is that her family
             have never supported her in Somalia or in the UK.

         81.  I find therefore that it is likely that the appellant would
             not be able to access the medical treatment that she needs in
             Mogadishu and I find that without that treatment the appellant
             would become very unwell and would likely die.

         82.  For these reasons I find that it has been established that the
             appellant would face very significant obstacles to her
             integration in Somalia and that she meets the requirements of
             Paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.'

Grounds of Appeal

The Secretary of State's grounds are short, running to eight paragraphs, a
number of which are summary or descriptive in nature. The key paragraphs
detail:

         '2.  The judge finds at [82] that the appellant's inability to pay
             for medical care in Somalia would constitute an
             'insurmountable obstacle' to her reintegration and therefore
             meeting the requirements of Paragraph 276ADE

         3.   While the judge has examined the appellant's medical issues
             and dismissed them under article 3, the judge has considered
             the exact same factors and allowed them under article 8
             instead, which, it is submitted, is an error of law

         4.   ...

         5.   It is further submitted that the judge has failed to consider
             section 117B and the obvious public interest considerations in
             this case. The appellant's entire stay in the UK has been an
             unlawful one - having spent only four years in the UK and the
             majority of her life in Somalia - and cannot therefore be
             afforded any weight in an overall proportionality assessment.

         6.   There are no findings on the appellant's financial
             independence, but it is clear that her intention in the UK is
             to avail herself of NHS services, at a cost to the public
             purse.

         7.   It is submitted that these factors represent weighty factors
             in the proportionality assessment to be conducted by the
             judge, and in overlooking them, the judge has arrived at a
             flawed conclusion that renders the entire determination
             unsafe.'

The Secretary of State solely relies at [4] of her grounds, without more,
upon two paragraphs from Akhalu (health claim: ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT
00400 (IAC), namely [45]- [46]:

          'The correct approach is for the judge to have regard to every
         aspect of the claimant's private life here, as well as the
         consequences for her health on removal, but to have in mind when
         striking the balance of proportionality that a comparison of levels
         of medical treatment available is something that will not in itself
         have any real impact on the outcome of the exercise. The judge must
         recognise, as did Judge Saffer, that it will be a rare case that
         succeeds where this is an important aspect of the claimant's case.

         Put another way, the consequences of removal for the health of a
         claimant who would not be able to access equivalent health care in
         their country of nationality as was available in this country, are
         plainly relevant to the question of proportionality. But when
         weighed against the public interest in ensuring that the limited
         resources of this country's health service are used to the best
         effect for the benefit of those for whom they are intended, those
         consequences do not weigh heavily in the claimant's favour but
         speak cogently in support of the public interests in removal.'

I observe that the consideration of article 8 in Akhalu is concerned with a
decision of the Secretary of State predating the coming into force of
paragraph 276ADE on 9 July 2012 and therefore the Tribunal was not able to
consider the identification of circumstances arising within paragraph
276ADE(1)(vi) to outweigh the public interest in removal.

When granting permission to appeal on 27 November 2019 DJFtT Manuell
provided the following reasons:

         '1.  The onwards grounds dated 30 October 2019 were in time. The
             grounds erroneously assert that the judge allowed the
             appellant's asylum appeal, when it was unequivocally
             dismissed. The grounds go on in summary to assert that the
             judge should not have allowed the appellant's article 8 ECHR
             appeal on health grounds and failed to apply the relevant law
             (including section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and
             Asylum Act 2002).

         2.   Although this is plainly a hard case (the appellant requires
             kidney dialysis), the grounds are arguable, particularly as
             her previous appeal was dismissed and she failed to leave the
             United Kingdom. The judge's approach to the applicable law is
             arguably insufficiently rigorous and inadequate.'

Decision

Mr Bates on behalf of the Secretary of State candidly accepted that ��3, 4,
5, 6 and 7 of the grounds of appeal were focused upon a proportionality
consideration outside of the Immigration Rules. He further accepted that
the Judge did not undertake a proportionality exercise because she found
that the appellant satisfied the requirements of article 8 established
under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules.

Mr Bates asked me to find that it was implicit that a challenge to such
finding was made within �2 of the grounds of appeal and if I were to so
find I should then find that the Judge materially erred in law by not
following the guidance of the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for the
Home Department v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813. I have considered Mr Bates'
submissions with care but upon examining �2 of the Secretary of State's
grounds it is abundantly clear that the paragraph simply states the basis
on which the appeal was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal and does not
itself constitute a ground of appeal. It is simply part of the opening
summary. The paragraphs that follow are all concerned with the
proportionality consideration that takes place when article 8 is examined
outside of the Rules and such consideration is not part of the assessment
undertaken under paragraph 276ADE. I am satisfied that the author did not
draft grounds challenging the Judge's decision as to article 8 under the
Rules and such a challenge cannot be implied by �2 of the grounds.
Permission was not granted to the Secretary of State to challenge the
Judge's decision as to the appellant meeting the requirements of paragraph
276ADE of the Rules.

Mr Bates helpfully accepted that if I could not read an implicit challenge
as arising within �2 then the Secretary of State's grounds do not challenge
the reasons for the appeal being allowed. He rightly accepted that in such
circumstances the Secretary of State's appeal must fail for the reasons
confirmed by the Upper Tribunal in OK (PTA; alternative findings) [2020]
UKUT 44.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the
making of a material error on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld, and the appeal is
dismissed.
