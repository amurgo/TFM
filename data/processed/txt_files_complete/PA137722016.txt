                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant: Miss Isherwood Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

For the Respondent: Mr J Collins instructed by Marsh & Partners Solicitors.



                            DECISION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a  decision  of
        First-tier Tribunal Judge Sethi promulgated on 10 February 2017  in
        which the Judge dismissed BX's appeal on asylum grounds but allowed
        the appeal on humanitarian protection and Articles  3  and  8  ECHR
        grounds.
     2. The core finding is that as a result of BX returning to Albania  as
        a single mother with a very young child she would be exposed  to  a
        real risk of future abuse and exploitation in an attempt to make  a
        life for herself and her child amongst  a  hostile  community,  and
        would not be able to  re-establish  any  kind  of  normal  life  in
        Albania for herself and her son [59]; that BX faces a real risk  of
        serious harm through domestic violence at the hands of  the  family
        members in her home area in respect of which she would not  have  a
        sufficiency of protection and that it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
        expect BX to relocate on her own as a single  mother  with  a  very
        young child within Tirana or another southern city;  leading  to  a
        conclusion there was no safe internal relocation  option  available
        for BX and her child [60]. As internal relocation is not  a  viable
        option BX has demonstrated there are very significant obstacles  to
        her reintegration into Albanian society leading to the appeal being
        allowed pursuant to  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  Immigration
        Rules.



Error of law


     3. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on one ground in
        the following terms:


            The appeal against  refusal  of  asylum  has  been  allowed  on
            humanitarian protection and Article 3 and 8 grounds.


            The disposal of  the  appeal  was  squarely  on  the  basis  of
            findings that the  appellant  and  her  18-month-old  (approx.)
            daughter  would  be  returning   together   and   without   the
            appellant's partner (who is also the child's father).  This  is
            clear from [54], [59] and [61].


            The Judge has referred to no sensible reason why the appellants
            partner cannot reasonably return with the appellant  and  their
            child. He is also an Albanian national. The only  statement  in
            the determination capable of explaining why he might not return
            is that he 'has been in this country since he was 15  years  of
            age and has made his home here' [44].


            The Judge states [44] that the Home Office  representative  did
            not cross examine the appellants partner, 'and his evidence  is
            therefore unchallenged'. With respect, this is neither here nor
            there. He has expressed what amounts to a  mere  preference  to
            remain in the UK, rather than return with his  family  unit  to
            the country of their nationality.


            All of the findings on internal relocation, ability to access a
            women's shelter or refuge, and risk on return are predicated on
            a finding that the appellant and her child  would  be  returned
            without  male  protection.   That   finding   is   unsafe   and
            inadequately reasoned, as is the outcome of the appeal.


            Permission to appeal is sought; an oral hearing is requested.


     4. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-tier
        Tribunal. The operative part of the grant being:


            3.    In an otherwise carefully and well reasoned  decision  and
                reasons it is nonetheless arguable that  as  the  Appellants
                partner confirmed in evidence  that  he  would  support  the
                partner and child if they had to return,  the  judge  should
                have lawfully explored possibilities of the  Appellant,  her
                daughter, and her partner returning together to Albania  and
                internal  relocation  options  available  to  them.  It   is
                arguable that there was no evidence of any direct threat  to
                the  Appellant  and  it  is  further   arguable   that   the
                established case law finds that there is  a  sufficiency  of
                protection in Albania for the Appellant.


     5. It is  important  to  note  the  exact  terms  of  the  appellant's
        partner's evidence referred to by the Judge  in  the  decision  and
        alluded to by the Secretary of State when applying  for  permission
        to appeal. The Judge's note of the evidence is legible and  appears
        in the following terms:


        |Name                      |[AC]                                    |

|                          |                                        |

|                          |                                        |
|                          |She could be killed.                    |
|                          |                                        |

     6. The Judge also notes, in a comment annotated  by  a  stared  symbol
        within a circle, the words "No cross-examination".
     7. Submissions made by Counsel representing  the  Secretary  of  State
        before the First-tier Tribunal are recorded by  the  Judge  in  the
        following terms:


           "Respondent's submission


           Cutting  through  long  reasons  for  refusal  letter  -  SSHD's
           position is no evidence of threats or history of danger  to  the
           appellant or her child from her father.


           Consider background information - need to decide


           Loving, unmarried or perceived married mother -  sufficiency  of
           protection?


           Not unreasonable to expect her to relocate to  another  part  of
           Albania.


           Partner confirms he would support partner and child if they  had
           to return.


           Maybe harsh for A to return as there is no real risk of  serious
           harm whether under the Refugee Convention or H.P alone/Art 3.


           No evidence of any threats.
           Submit sufficiency of protection.
           Could relocate with child.


           S55 Best interests of child with mother although not  ideal  for
           child to be separated from father.


           -S117(B)(6). Not a qualifying child.


     8. Far more detailed submissions were made on BX's behalf  in  support
        of the appeal being allowed.
     9. The first issue to note is that  the  appellants  partner  did  not
        indicate in his evidence that he would  be  willing  to  return  to
        Albania and does not, as  alleged,  wish  to  stay  in  the  United
        Kingdom solely through choice. The partner clearly  indicates  that
        he cannot return to Albania and gives reasons why  this  should  be
        so, based upon his own personal safety, which was not challenged or
        explored  by  the  Secretary  of  States  representative  in  cross
        examination.
    10. There is no challenge to the  factual  findings  of  the  Judge  in
        relation to the core account leading to a real risk on  account  of
        BX infringing her family's honour by fleeing without permission and
        not  marrying  her  current  partner  with  whom  she  has  had  an
        illegitimate child. At [50] the Judge finds:


            50.    I  find  having  regard  to  the  appellant's   previous
                 perceived dishonour to her father (and to the man  to  whom
                 she was promised) that should the appellant return  to  her
                 home area in Albania now with the child of a man who is not
                 her husband, that the  shame  that  she  is  said  to  have
                 brought to her family name would be further fuelled. I find
                 that her fear that she would be at  real  risk  of  serious
                 harm through domestic violence at the hands of her  father,
                 uncle or [AB] in addition to  facing  hostility,  rejection
                 and stigmatisation by her community at large is,  in  light
                 of the background information, a credible one. This is  the
                 reason that I accept that the appellant originates  Elbasan
                 from  a  Muslim  family.  I  find  that  there  is  a  real
                 possibility that religious and traditional  values  prevail
                 in her home area through which domestic violence is  likely
                 to be viewed as 'a private, family matter and a normal part
                 of marriage and family life' rather than a crime.


    11. The Judge  was,  therefore,  required  to  consider  the  issue  of
        sufficiency  of  protection  from  the   authorities,   which   was
        considered in detail in the decision under challenge from  [51]  to
        [53].  At [53] the Judge finds:


            53.    I  find  that   the   background   country   information
                 demonstrates that there is a real risk that  the  appellant
                 would not be able to secure effective protection  from  the
                 authorities in her home area against  any  attempt  by  her
                 father, uncle or [AB] to cause harm. I  find  that  further
                 that as the appellant's conduct is a matter of 'honour' for
                 the men concerned that it is also likely that  her  father,
                 uncle  or  [AB]  would  be  deterred  by  the   threat   of
                 prosecution, even if prosecutions were effectively  brought
                 which the background information suggests  they  are  often
                 not. In addition I take  into  account  that  [AB]  is  the
                 nephew of a former Chief of Police. I find that it  is  not
                 implausible that he would  have  connections  or  influence
                 amongst the local police which could encourage inaction  in
                 response to any redress sought by  the  appellant.  I  find
                 that the appellant has no other  connections  to  whom  she
                 could turn for support or  protection  in  her  home  area.
                 Albeit that she has a sister remaining in  Elbasan  I  find
                 that she would not be able to provide to the appellant with
                 the practical measures required to ensure her safety. I  am
                 accordingly satisfied that the appellant would not be  able
                 to return to her home area,  alone  or  with  a  child  and
                 reside there in safely.


    12. The Judge thereafter considered, in light of the finding  BX  could
        not return to her home area, whether she could  relocate  elsewhere
        in Albania bearing in mind she would be returning as a young single
        woman with a child  who  is  only  17  months  of  age.  The  Judge
        considered the possibility of the appellant  and  her  son  seeking
        refuge in a government run shelter outside her home area until such
        time as she was able to re-establish herself or make an application
        for entry clearance to join her fianc� in the UK  [54].  The  Judge
        found that even if BX could  be  accommodated  in  a  shelter,  the
        maximum permitted period for which is approximately two years, this
        meant she would leave with a child aged only three years of age and
        would still be a single young woman with a child without  any  male
        guardian or family support which would place her at  real  risk  of
        stigmatisation on account of society's negative perception  of  her
        [55]. For the reasons set out between [54] and [61] the  Judge  did
        not find on the facts of this case that internal relocation  was  a
        viable option as it was specifically found that it would be  unduly
        harsh to expect the appellant to relocate, as stated above.
    13. The grant of permission  refers  to  a  careful  and  well-reasoned
        decision which is an accurate reflection of the matters  considered
        by the Judge. The Secretary of State's assertion the  Judge  failed
        to explore the possibility that BX and her child could return  with
        her partner, as if the Judge should have done more, has no arguable
        merit. The evidence of the partner was wider than that set  out  in
        the grounds seeking permission to appeal yet there was no proper or
        adequate exploration of whether the partner could return to Albania
        with BX or the child, providing  the  requisite  male  support  the
        Judge clearly  found  will  be  lacking,  and  which  was  arguably
        instrumental in the appeal being allowed.
    14. The Secretary State had ample opportunity to test the  claims  made
        by both BX and her partner during the course  of  the  hearing  yet
        failed to do so to the extent the author  of  the  grounds  seeking
        permission to appeal infers he should  have  done.  Even  if  other
        Presenting Officers would have pursued  this  matter  further,  and
        made more detailed submissions, the fact of the matter is that  the
        Judge was left with  insufficient  evidence  on  which  to  base  a
        finding that BX's partner could return to Albania with her and with
        their child.
    15. Miss Isherwood argues that the partner only has leave valid to 2019
        and that the Reasons  for  Refusal  letter  asserted  there  was  a
        sufficiency of protection and  internal  flight  alternative.  What
        has, of course, occurred in the interim since  the  publication  of
        the reasons for refusal letter is the hearing at  which  the  Judge
        received evidence, clearly considered the same  with  the  required
        degree of anxious scrutiny, and has given adequate reasons for  the
        findings made. As such, the weight to be given to the evidence  was
        a matter for the Judge.  On the basis of the allocated  weight  the
        Judge concluded as he did.
    16. On the basis of the evidence made available no arguable legal error
        material to the decision to allow the appeal is made  out.  On  the
        basis of the evidence made available the findings by the Judge  are
        within the range of those reasonably available. The wish  for  what
        may be seen by some as the desire to reopen the case to  relitigate
        the question of the partner's position does not, per se, amount  to
        arguable legal error.
