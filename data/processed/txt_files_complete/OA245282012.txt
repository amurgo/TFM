                        ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   Representation:
   For the appellant:      Mr M  Iqbal  of  Counsel  instructed  by  Denning
                      Solicitors, (Barking Road)
   For the Respondent:     Miss A Everett, Senior Presenting Officer


 1. This appeal has been  brought  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer (the respondent at the first -tier Tribunal)  against
    the decision of Judge  Lingham  who  allowed  her  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision refusing her entry clearance to join her  husband
    in the UK for settlement. For the sake of consistency the  parties  are
    referred to in this determination in the same way as they  were  before
    the first tier.

 2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan. She was born  on  11  December
    1983. She was refused entry clearance to join her husband in the UK for
    settlement on the sole ground that she had not satisfied the respondent
    about her husband's ability to maintain her in the United Kingdom.  She
    had  applied  for  entry  clearance  on  20  September  2012  and   her
    application was turned down on 6 November 2012. In her application  for
    entry clearance the appellant had stated that Radio  Cars  Ltd  employs
    her husband at an annual salary of �19,200.00.

 3. The respondent in his refusal letter stated, "You say in your  Appendix
    2 that your sponsor is employed with radio cars  Ltd  since  01/05/2012
    and earns a gross annual salary of 19,200 per annum. However  you  have
    not provided all of the specified  documents  required  regarding  your
    sponsor's employment. These documents are specified in the  Immigration
    Rules in Appendix FM-SE and must be provided." The respondent  went  on
    to say, "Furthermore as your sponsor was not employed at Radio Cars for
    six months at the time of application and no evidence of  any  previous
    employment has been provided it appears that prior to starting at Radio
    Cars  your  sponsor's  annual  income  was  less  that  (sic)  �18,600.
    Therefore I am not satisfied that your sponsor's income in the last  12
    months prior to the application was �18,600 as required. Based  on  the
    evidence provided I therefore refuse your application  under  paragraph
    EC-P.1.1 (d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (E-ECP.3.1)."

 4. The First Tier Judge, Judge Lingham allowed the  appeal.  She  received
    substantial documentary evidence in support  of  the  appeal  from  the
    sponsor including his contract of employment  dated  6  November  2012,
    payslips from May 2012 to October 2012, sponsor's account of income and
    expenditure.  The  Judge  found  that  "the  requirement  on   salaried
    employment was introduced on 13 December 2012. The significance of  the
    date  is  that  the  appellant's  application  was  lodged  before  the
    introduction of the above specified evidence on 'salaried employment'."
    In the alternative the Judge found that the Respondent should have  but
    did not exercise any discretion to contact the appellant  according  to
    her Policy  or  the  Rules  and  therefore,  the  decision  is  not  in
    accordance with the law or the Rules. Judge  Langham  referred  to  and
    relied on the decision of Rodriguez [20130 UKUT 00042 (IAC).


 6. I heard submissions from Miss Everett and Mr Iqbal. Miss Everett relied
    and expanded on her grounds of appeal. Mr Iqbal argued  that  according
    to Section 85 (2) and the decision in DR (Morocco) it is  the  date  of
    decision and not the date of  application  that  is  relevant  in  this
    matter.  He  submitted  that  the  immigration  rule  advanced  by  the
    respondent is at best ambiguous and that the decision of Judge  Lingham
    is not in error of law.

 7. Having  given  careful  consideration  to  all  the  relevant  matters,
    including the grounds of appeal and the decision granting permission to
    appeal, I have concluded that the  decision  of  Judge  Lingham  is  in
    material error of law in that she failed to apply the immigration  rule
    relevant to the case. The respondent's ground 2 and  3  are  made  out.
    Although the Judge correctly held that HC760 as amended  on  13.12.2012
    did not apply to the case, she did not fully apply the  provision  that
    had been changed by HC760. Had she done so she  would  have  inevitably
    concluded that a number of evidentiary items that were required  to  be
    submitted with the application had not been filed. On  that  basis  the
    Judge was wrong  to  conclude  as  she  did  in  paragraph  21  of  her
    determination, "Therefore, I accept that when the appellant lodged  her
    application, she merely had to show at the date of application that her
    spouse was suitably employed  and  that  his  income  would  have  been
    adequate under the Rules to maintain the appellant and himself  without
    having recourse to public funds. Given the evidence before me, I accept
    that the appellant had met the sole requirement in the  appeal."  There
    can be little doubt that in the course of the  appeal  proceedings  the
    appellant had produced all the relevant evidence but she had  not  done
    so as required by the Rules at the time of the application or  even  at
    the time of the impugned decision.

 8. The Judge cannot be criticised for relying  on  Rodriguez  [2013]  UKUT
    00042 (IAC) that was good law at the time of her decision but has  been
    subsequently reversed by the Court of Appeal.

 9. I set aside the decision of Judge Langham as being in material error of
    law and in remaking the decision; I have no option but to  dismiss  the
    appeal against the decision of the respondent  for  the  reasons  given
    hereinabove.  I very much hope that the  respondent  will  determine  a
    fresh application from the appellant, if it  is  made,  on  a  priority
    basis as she meets all the requirements of the Rules now.




FEE AWARD
The decision on fee award made by Judge Langham is also  set  aside  as  the
appeal has been dismissed.

ANONYMITY DIRECTION
None has been sought and circumstances of the case do not warrant such
direction.
