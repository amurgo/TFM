Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Nicholson (instructed by Greater Manchester
                    Immigration Aid Unit)
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1.   This is a resumed hearing after I found,  at  a  hearing  on  29th
         April 2015, that the First-tier Tribunal had made an error  of  law
         in its determination promulgated on 23rd October 2014.

    2.   The Appellant, born on 11th February 1993 is an Iranian  national.
         He left Iran illegally in June 2012 and since  he  arrived  in  the
         United Kingdom claims to have converted from Islam to Christianity.
         He first claimed asylum which was refused and  his  appeal  against
         the  refusal  dismissed  in  October  2012  in  Newport  by   Judge
         Trevaskis.

    3.   The Appellant then claimed that his circumstances had changed,  in
         particular with regard  to  his  conversion  to  Christianity.  The
         Secretary of State made a  further  decision  refusing  his  asylum
         claim relying on  the  decision  of  Judge  Trevaskis,  a  lack  of
         credibility on the basis of his  inconsistency  and  implausibility
         and also the possibility of internal relocation.  That decision was
         taken on 29th August 2014 and was the subject of an  appeal  before
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox at Manchester on 13th October 2014.

    4.   The Judge indicated in his decision that he  heard  evidence  from
         the Appellant and from three witnesses with regard to  his  claimed
         conversion to Christianity. He dismissed the appeal.  At  paragraph
         18 of the decision he found the inconsistencies referred to in  the
         Letter of Refusal and amplified in the evidence detracted from  the
         Appellant's  credibility.  He  also  disregarded   the   witnesses'
         evidence as not being independent or credible and  so  far  as  the
         Appellant's  recent  activities  in  the  church   were   concerned
         suggested that they were done entirely  for  the  purposes  of  the
         appeal and asylum process.

    5.   The grounds upon which permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
         was granted were that the Judge had misapplied  the  principles  of
         Devaseelan [2003] Imm AR 1, misdirected himself with regard to  the
         standard of proof in relation to persecution  and  failed  to  give
         anxious scrutiny to the evidence.   He  also  arguably  misdirected
         himself as to the law in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR.

    6.   Mr Karnik, who represented the Appellant  on  29th  April,  argued
         that the Judge failed to consider  adequately  or  at  all  whether
         there was a  risk  on  return  for  a  person  who  had  left  Iran
         illegally. There was extensive evidence in the  Appellant's  bundle
         before  the  Judge  which  would  indicate  persons  leaving   Iran
         illegally are at risk on return. The Judge ought to  have  analysed
         that evidence which post dated his previous appeal in 2012 and  the
         relevant country guidance case and he failed to do so.

    7.   So far as Horvath and internal relocation is concerned  Mr  Karnik
         argued that it had no application because the threat is from  State
         actors.

    8.   He argued that  paragraph  24  of  the  decision  and  reasons  is
         confused with regard to the standard of proof.

    9.   He  argued  that  the  actual  evidence  of  the  three  witnesses
         regarding the  Appellant's  Christianity  was  disregarded  without
         proper scrutiny. One was a Pastor who had travelled  to  Manchester
         from Swansea to give evidence.

    10.  Having read the determination with care I accepted that the  Judge
         fell into error in his consideration of the evidence. He had relied
         heavily on  the  previous  determination  without  giving  adequate
         scrutiny to the evidence before him. He gave no adequate reason  to
         discount the evidence of the witnesses. He failed to  consider  the
         evidence before him as regards risk on return to a person who  left
         Iran illegally and he failed to give proper  consideration  to  the
         genuineness of the Appellant's conversion to Christianity.

    11.  As the errors went to the heart of the claim I  decided  that  the
         determination could not stand and I set it aside in its entirety. I
         directed the appeal be reheard in the Upper Tribunal.

    12.  Before me Mr Nicholson did not seek to reopen  the  claims  as  to
         what had occurred in Iran which had been found  incredible  in  the
         original asylum appeal before Judge Trevaskis  and  confirmed  that
         the sole issue for me to decide was whether  the  Appellant  was  a
         genuine convert from Islam to Christianity  and  whether  he  would
         face detention and ill-treatment on return as a  result  of  having
         left illegally.

    13.  I was to hear evidence from the  Appellant,  from  Pastor  Kenneth
         George Robling from the City Church in Swansea, Mr  Arman  Afaridi,
         an Iranian national who has been recognised as  a  refugee  and  Mr
         Dawood Shariffnassab, originally an Iranian national, now a British
         citizen.

    14.  I established that the relevant evidence and documents  before  me
         comprised the Secretary of State's original bundle, pages 1  to  39
         of the Appellant's bundle before the First-tier  Tribunal.  It  now
         being accepted by the Secretary of State that genuine  converts  to
         Christianity from Islam are at risk in Iran, the remainder of  that
         bundle was no longer relevant. I had a  supplementary  bundle  from
         the Appellant comprising 76 pages which included a country expert's
         report from Dr Mohammed Kakhki dated 20th May 2015 and I also had a
         third bundle provided for the hearing before me containing the Home
         Office Country Information and Guidance with  regard  to  Christian
         converts dated December 2014, the letter sent  on  the  Appellant's
         behalf making fresh representations in June 2012 with regard to his
         conversion, a letter from Elim Pentecostal Church  in  Huddersfield
         dated 29th November 2011 and a letter from Pastor Sheila Murphy  of
         the  World   Harvest   Bible   Church   in   Salford,   Manchester.
         Additionally, Mr Nicholson handed a skeleton argument  in  relation
         to detention on return to Iran and a further statement from  Pastor
         Robling dated 21st August 2015 and a  further  letter  from  Pastor
         Sheila Murphy dated 22nd August 2015. Mr Harrison had no objections
         to the submission of the new pieces of evidence.

    The Evidence

    15.  The Appellant adopted his two witness statement dated 3rd  October
         2014 and 13th May 2015.

    16.  In his first statement the Appellant  confirmed  he  came  to  the
         United Kingdom with his sister and her daughter in August 2012  and
         claimed asylum. At first they were accommodated  in  Cardiff  where
         they were visited by people from a church and invited to go to  the
         church. The church provided  an  interpreter  for  the  many  Farsi
         speakers who attended. He did not go to that church very often.

    17.  The Appellant was due to move to Swansea and a friend of his  from
         the hostel where he had been  staying  in  Cardiff,  gave  him  the
         contact details of an Iranian friend in Swansea. The Appellant made
         contact with him and they became friends. This friend,  Habib  told
         the Appellant that he was a Christian and  a  member  of  the  City
         Temple Church in Swansea. He introduced the Appellant to the church
         and he took the Appellant to English lessons at the church and then
         he attended a service and thereafter  regularly  attended  four  or
         five times a week. There were also lots of activities  outside  the
         Sunday service such as Bible study classes and English lessons.  He
         also attended meetings and helped to clean the church  and  prepare
         for  services  such  as  helping  to  arrange   tables   and   with
         refreshments.

    18.  The Pastor, Pastor Ken Robling, encouraged the Appellant  to  talk
         about  Christianity  with  his  friends,  which  he  did  on   many
         occasions, as well as distributing leaflets. He  also  invited  his
         sister to attend church. He was baptised on 11th November 2012  and
         he  continued  to  attend  church  regularly  and  to  form   close
         relationships with other members of the church.

    19.  In June 2013 the Appellant, his sister and her daughter  moved  to
         Manchester and he lived for a time with a friend  of  his  parents,
         Dawood, until he was given his own NASS accommodation. Dawood  told
         the Appellant about the various  churches  in  Manchester  and  the
         Appellant's sister chose the World Harvest Bible Church in  Salford
         to join. He first attended  about  a  month  after  he  arrived  in
         Manchester which was approximately July  2013.  He  attended  every
         Sunday service and then drop  ins  on  Thursdays  and  Bible  study
         classes also.

    20.  He was then given NASS accommodation in  Wrexham  at  the  end  of
         2014. He wanted to continue to attend the same church because  that
         was where all his friends were and so he did not look for a  church
         in Wrexham.  He continued to attend church once every two weeks. In
         addition he also goes to the church in Swansea occasionally.

    21.  In his statement of May 2015 he said that he continues  to  attend
         the World Harvest Bible Church in Salford regularly  attending  the
         Sunday services, Thursday afternoon Bible study groups and the drop-
         in services on Tuesdays and Thursdays. He said  that  he  did  miss
         some of the Bible study groups because  Pastor  Sheila  Murphy  had
         been ill. He said that he continued to regularly attend the drop-in
         services on Tuesday and Thursday at Dallas  Court  in  Salford  and
         continues to give leaflets to people outside the church and to talk
         to them about Christianity and  invite  them  to  attend.  He  also
         maintains his links with the church in Swansea and he visited there
         at Christmas 2014.

    22.  In his oral evidence he  said  that  the  reason  he  believed  in
         Christianity was because since he has become a  believer  he  could
         feel in his heart kindness and calmness. He said,  when  asked  how
         often he went to Church in Salford, that because he  now  lives  in
         Wrexham and the church is in Salford and because of  the  distance,
         he attends only once every two weeks or sometimes every week if  he
         can and also  when  he  visits  his  sister  in  Manchester.   That
         evidence is noticeably different from the picture  painted  in  his
         May 2015 statement.

    23.  Under cross-examination he indicated that  his  sister  also  goes
         Church but she was not  present  as  a  witness.  She  has  been  a
         Christian since November 2012 and it was he who  started  attending
         the church first and he  encouraged  her  to  go.  They  were  both
         baptised on 11th November 2012.

    24.  He said that he had told his family in  Iran  that  he  is  now  a
         Christian and that his father was happy with the situation  because
         he feels that every individual has the right to choose his beliefs.
         His father is a Muslim but  not  an  extremist.  He  inherited  his
         Muslim faith from his father. He  indicated  that  he  remained  in
         contact with his family but they have to  be  cautious  about  what
         they talk about. His relationship with his family has  not  changed
         as a result of his conversion to Christianity. He has  his  parents
         in Iran as  well  as  other  family  members  to  whom  he  is  not
         particularly close.

    25.  He said that since his conversion to  Christianity  he  speaks  to
         other Iranians about his faith. He said that  he  has  some  Muslim
         friends as well as Christian friends and they always talk about the
         differences between Islam and Christianity.

    26.  At this point I asked him to explain  what  the  differences  were
         between Islam and Christianity but he was unable to  explain,  save
         to say that having been born into a Muslim family he had no  choice
         about his faith and as he was growing up he could not see  so  much
         freedom and could not talk about everything and that Islam is about
         killing and lies whereas Christianity is about kindness and  loving
         each other. He was asked again about the  differences  between  the
         two faiths and he said that when he engaged in discussion with  his
         friends he pointed out to them that  you  could  see  that  in  the
         Muslim countries they were killing each other but on the other hand
         when he goes Church it is kindness and  when  he  says  prayers  he
         feels a calmness and is relaxed.  He  was  asked  again  about  the
         differences between the two faiths and he said that in his opinion,
         in Islam there is no option what to believe and no right to  change
         religion and you cannot criticise Islam and there is no freedom  of
         speech so far as religion  is  concerned.  There  is  no  kindness;
         Muslims do not help each other and Christians can talk freely, help
         each other and are kind to each other.

    27.  He said that when he was in Iran he had no  Islamic  training;  he
         did not go to any classes to learn about the Koran. In  the  UK  he
         has studied the Bible. He was asked who he thought the Prophet  was
         and he said he believed that God has a  son,  Jesus.  When  he  was
         asked who he thought the Prophet Muhammad was, he said that in  his
         opinion he was just a human being who was born and  died.  He  said
         that Jesus Christ is God and the only God and  that  there  are  no
         other Gods; there is the Father, the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit
         - then he said the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

    28.  He confirmed that he had helped other Iranians change  from  Islam
         to Christianity and when asked how he did this he said that when he
         meets an Iranian Muslim he does not force them to  convert  but  he
         invites them and he starts by comparing the way of  life  all  over
         the world and about Muslims killing Muslims and that  as  a  Muslim
         you are fearful of God whereas in Christianity you can  talk  about
         God freely and God does not threaten you.

    29.  It was put to the Appellant that there are  lots  of  examples  of
         Christians killing  other  Christians  and  he  was  asked  how  he
         reconciled that  with  what  he  had  just  said.  He  agreed  that
         Christians also kill each other but not to  the  same  extent  that
         Muslims killed other Muslims. That does not sit well with the  wars
         and genocide throughout history, including the  Crusades  and  wars
         between Christians and Muslims. He said that in Christianity if you
         need help there is only one God whereas in Islam they worship  many
         different Imams and you do not know who to pray to.  That does  not
         sit well with what is generally known about Allah and  the  Prophet
         Mohammed.  The Appellant is not an uneducated man; he  has  studied
         engineering at university.

    30.  The Appellant was asked what his relationship was with Christ  and
         he said  he  had  a  direct  connection  with  him  and  he  always
         appreciates what he gave him and he is always with him  even  while
         he was in court.  He helps him at all times and Jesus  Christ  gave
         him a peaceful life, health, healthy parents and peace. He believes
         that before he came to this understanding with Jesus Christ he  was
         a sinner. He said Jesus Christ, who is God, himself appeared  as  a
         human being and sacrificed himself; he was crucified and  that  was
         because he wanted his followers to be free from sin.

    31.  He said that if he went back to Iran he would want to continue  to
         practise Christianity although it would be very difficult; he would
         certainly follow his beliefs. He said he was not  sure  whether  he
         would admit to his conversion on arrival at the airport because  he
         would be afraid.

    32.  I asked him about his circumstances in Wrexham  and  he  confirmed
         that he received NASS support of �36 a week and that  he  travelled
         to Salford on the train which cost  �18  return;  half  his  weekly
         income. I asked him why he did not go to church in Wrexham  and  he
         said that because when he lived in Manchester he went to the  World
         Harvest Bible Church because other Iranians go there and  he  could
         not find a church in Wrexham that Iranians went to. Language  is  a
         problem and he preferred to go to church in Manchester.

    33.  I then heard evidence from Pastor Robling.  In  his  statement  he
         explained that he is a retired minister of the City Church  but  he
         remains heavily involved. He has been a minister since 1975 and  is
         in charge of pastoral care which involves teaching Bible  study  to
         new Christians and he has responsibility for Christian  counselling
         of any new members and members of the congregation.

    34.  He explained that the  Appellant  started  attending  the  English
         class that he runs at the church in Swansea on 6th September  2012.
         At the conclusion of the class the Appellant asked to speak to  him
         about Christianity because his  friend  who  had  brought  him  had
         become a convert that May. He said  that  he  was  fearful  of  the
         consequences of conversion because of  what  happens  in  Iran  and
         Pastor Robling assured him that would not happen in  the  UK.  They
         had a lengthy conversation and  Pastor  Robling  showed  him  Bible
         verses and the  Appellant  decided  then  to  accept  the  biblical
         beliefs  of  Christianity  and  what  was  expected  of  him  as  a
         consequence. He prayed the sinner's prayer and Pastor Robling  gave
         him a copy of his "Decision" which is given to all new converts and
         it was dated 6th September 2012.

    35.  Pastor Robling then indicated that the Appellant  attended  Sunday
         services until he left Swansea for  Manchester.  He  also  attended
         Bible study courses for new converts and  classes  to  prepare  for
         baptism. He applied for and was baptised in a ceremony conducted by
         Pastor Robling on 11th November  2012.  In  order  to  qualify  for
         baptism the Appellant had to attend the water  baptism  preparation
         class conducted over a three-week period in addition to  the  other
         classes that he already attended. He also had to satisfy the church
         leadership that he was serious.

    36.  In his oral evidence Pastor Robling adopted his two statements  as
         being true and correct. He said that he had attended  other  asylum
         appeal hearings for other Iranian Christian converts and also  that
         he has  refused  to  attend  some.  He  said  that  he  would  most
         definitely  not  have  been  willing  to  give  evidence   on   the
         Appellant's behalf if he did not believe that he  was  genuinely  a
         Christian. He was asked why he believed he was  a  genuine  convert
         and he said that he had been  present  on  the  occasion  when  the
         Appellant  made  the  decision  after  his  period  of  counselling
         following English classes. He said that he and the Appellant had an
         affinity in spirit with one another  and  the  Appellant  had  been
         brought into God's family through Jesus Christ and  that  does  not
         happen if a person has not been born again. He said he  could  tell
         that he had let Jesus Christ into his life on 6 September. He  said
         that the Appellant had some knowledge of Christianity  already  and
         he knew that he had to pray to Jesus Christ  to  forgive  his  past
         sins and that the only way was to confess his  sin  and  let  Jesus
         Christ into his heart.

    37.  The Pastor was asked whether he thought the Appellant  could  have
         been fooling him and he said that with his experience he could tell
         and it was all to do with the affinity of spirit that he  had  with
         the Appellant and that he believed the Appellant genuinely to be  a
         child of God.

    38.  Pastor Robling was referred to the decision in 2012 when the Judge
         said that he did not believe the Appellant had converted because he
         had not yet reached the level of understanding required  by  Pastor
         Robling. He was asked if he felt that he now did have that level of
         understanding and he said that he certainly did and indeed  he  did
         so the moment he confessed his sins on 6th September 2012. He  also
         pointed out that the Appellant attended baptism classes  for  three
         weeks as well as Bible study.

    39.  In cross-examination he was asked about the Appellant's conversion
         on 6th September 2012 and he confirmed that that was the first time
         that he had met the Appellant. He was asked if it  was  common  for
         people to be converted in an instant and he said that  it  was.  It
         sometimes takes longer but is often immediate. With regard  to  the
         checks before somebody is baptised he said that was what they  were
         doing in the two months from his conversion and before his baptism.
         So far as the church oversight of the process is concerned he  said
         that he had refused to baptise some people because either they were
         not genuine or not serious enough in  their  commitment  to  follow
         Jesus Christ. He has been involved with  the  City  Church  for  24
         years and for the last 11 years has been responsible for  Iranians.
         He says that in the last 11 years he has  seen  roughly  70  to  80
         converts from Islam to Christianity.  When  asked  how  many  still
         attended the church he said that there were very  few.  After  they
         were given leave to remain they moved away. He said there are still
         Iranian converts and he has a Bible study class currently  with  15
         Iranians. There are also  Eritrean  converts  but  they  are  in  a
         different class and there are about 20 of them. He said that  there
         are 40 nations represented at the City Church. In the  congregation
         of 400  there  are  approximately  250  who  are  British  and  the
         remainder are a mix of nationalities.

    40.  He was asked if he knew if there is an Elim Church in Wrexham and
         he said to his knowledge there is not but there is an Assemblies of
         God church which is another Pentecostal Church.  He confirmed that
         the Elim Church and the Assemblies of God Church are two of the
         largest churches in the world.

    41.  He said that he believed the Appellant would try to continue to be
         an evangelical Christian in Iran but it  would  be  very  difficult
         because of the restrictions in that country.

    42.  With regard to the church's oversight of conversions he said  that
         he sits on the Board but the Board relies on him because he is  the
         person with the most experience. The other members of the Board try
         and observe converts but mostly they rely upon him.

    43.  He said that of the 70 to 80 converts he had seen in the  past  11
         years only about 10 were not genuine.

    44.  I then heard evidence from  Arman  Afaridi.  He  adopted  his  two
         statements of evidence. In his first statement he confirmed that he
         had come to the UK in 2009 and claimed asylum which was refused. He
         was  eventually  granted  refugee  status  on  the  basis  of   his
         conversion in the UK to Christianity. He remains  a  Christian  and
         attends the World Harvest Bible  Church  in  Salford.  He  met  the
         Appellant  through  a  mutual  friend  at  church,  saw  him  there
         regularly and they became friends. The  Appellant  used  to  attend
         church regularly but he struggled to do so after he  was  moved  to
         Wrexham. However, he said that the Appellant was now attending more
         regularly and he saw him at Sunday services and  Wednesday  drop-in
         sessions. He said that from the beginning  of  September  2014  the
         Appellant had attended Bible study classes and  also  attended  the
         Wednesday drop-in sessions as well when they took leaflets from the
         church and distributed them to asylum seekers waiting  outside  the
         reporting centre at Dallas  Court.   They  invited  them  into  the
         church for tea and a chat with the Pastors to try  and  help  them.
         They also talked about Christianity and encouraged them to come  to
         Bible study classes. In his more recent statement he said  that  he
         believed the Appellant to be a genuine  Christian  because  of  the
         conversations he had had with him over the past 1� to 2  years.  He
         confirmed that he had met the Appellant 1� to 2 years ago  when  he
         came to the church with a friend.  They  got  together  and  became
         friends.  He did not know him before he came to the church. He said
         that he is one of the interpreters that the church uses.  He  knows
         Pastor Sheila Murphy and he said that it is the church's policy not
         to come to court to give evidence. He does not have any  leadership
         role at the church; is not a Minister or a  Pastor.  He  said  that
         currently he sees the Appellant at least every two weeks, sometimes
         more often.

    45.  He was asked how many converts  from  Islam  he  had  met  in  the
         church. He said that since he has been a member, since  April  2011
         there have been maybe 100 -120 converts - they have been coming and
         going.  Of those 100 - 120 converts a maximum of 40  still  attend.
         Their nationalities  were  Iranian,  some  Afghans  and  some  from
         Turkmenistan. He confirmed that the church targets  Iranian  asylum
         seekers for conversion and encourages them to evangelise  in  Iran.
         When he was asked how he assessed whether they are genuine  or  not
         he said it was not the words but their actions which revealed this.
         As regards the Appellant's evangelising in Manchester he said  that
         at the drop-in sessions they distributed leaflets to asylum seekers
         who attended Dallas Court particularly Iranians.

    46.  He said that he had never been to Wrexham; he sees  the  Appellant
         when he comes to Salford.  As he is  now  studying  and  unable  to
         attend church as often he is not able to say what the Appellant has
         been doing for the past eight months.

    47.  I then heard evidence from Dawood Shariffnassab. He  also  adopted
         his statement from September  2014.  He  explained  that  he  is  a
         British citizen having previously been granted asylum  and  he  has
         been in the UK for 10 years. He  himself  is  a  Christian  and  he
         attends a church in Heaton Mersey in Didsbury.

    48.  He is a friend of the Appellant's parents in Iran; he used to live
         in the same town. They contacted him telling him that the Appellant
         was in the UK and gave him his contact details.  Approximately  one
         month after the Appellant arrived Mr Shariffnassab went to  Swansea
         to see him after which they kept in regular  contact  by  telephone
         and met approximately once a  month.  He  has  been  asked  by  the
         Appellant's parents to look after him and that is what he is trying
         to do.

    49.  When he was in Manchester the Appellant lived with him and when he
         was given NASS accommodation in Wrexham he helped him to  move.  He
         was aware the Appellant attended a church in Manchester but he  has
         not been to that church because he attends  his  own  church.  They
         discuss the Bible and Christianity together. He is aware  that  the
         Appellant's parents are open-minded and happy  that  the  Appellant
         has changed his faith.

    50.  In his oral evidence Mr Shariffnassab confirmed that at  the  time
         he met the Appellant in the UK he had already been  accepted  as  a
         refugee on the basis of his Christianity. He was unable to remember
         whether, when he first met the Appellant, he had already  converted
         to Christianity but he did recall they had talked about it. He said
         that he sees the Appellant  currently  2  to  3  times  every  week
         usually on Sundays and he travels to Manchester at other  times  as
         well. He sees him most of the time in Manchester.  He  specifically
         confirmed that the Appellant comes to Manchester two or three times
         a week currently and that he travels by train or bus. He  confirmed
         that he did help the Appellant out financially from  time  to  time
         and paid his fares. He said that he  had  come  to  court  to  give
         evidence at  the  suggestion  of  the  Appellant's  solicitors  who
         thought it may help. He confirmed that  if  he  did  not  genuinely
         believe the Appellant to be Christian he would  not  have  come  to
         court to give evidence.

    Submissions

    51.  Mr Harrison relied on the Letter of Refusal since which  time  the
         issues had narrowed and now the issue is essentially whether or not
         the Appellant is a genuine convert  to  Christianity.  He  accepted
         that a genuine convert is at risk on return to Iran and the issue I
         have to decide  is  whether  I  accepted  the  evidence  about  the
         conversion  process  in  Swansea  and  whether  the  Appellant  has
         continued to practise Christianity in Manchester. He pointed to the
         fact that the Pastor had failed to come to  give  evidence  on  his
         behalf which has been a requirement in  accordance  with  case  law
         since as far back as 2002 when Dorodian was  decided.  I  had  been
         told that it was the church's policy not to attend  court  but  the
         policy was not  mentioned  in  either  of  Pastor  Sheila  Murphy's
         letters.  He  submitted  that  although  Pastor  Robling   was   an
         independent witness the other two witnesses were not and  only  saw
         the Appellant infrequently.

    52.  Mr Nicholson urged me to allow the appeal. With regard to Dorodian
         he said that it is not necessary for the current Pastor  to  attend
         as long as one has and I was  entitled  to  take  my  own  judicial
         knowledge into account. He  relied  heavily  on  the  part  of  the
         original asylum appeal determination where the Judge felt that  the
         Appellant  had  not  learned  enough  to   reach   the   level   of
         understanding required by Pastor Robling but he had  now  confirmed
         clearly in evidence that he had reached that level.

    53.  He urged me to accept the witness  evidence  as  convincing.   The
         Appellant explained, supported by the evidence  of  Pastor  Robling
         that he had let Christ into his heart and that was a critical  sign
         of conversion. Pastor Robling's belief in him was borne out because
         he continues to attend  church.  He  urged  me  to  find  that  the
         discrepancies in the number of his visits to the church are a minor
         matter and that I should find the Appellant credible.

    54.  With regard to the Appellant's responses about his faith; that  he
         has found safety in the UK and the ability to associate with others
         which he may associate with Christianity, does not mean that he  is
         not also a genuine Christian.

    55.  Finally, Mr Nicholson argued with  regard  to  the  issue  of  the
         illegal exit, that he relied upon his skeleton  argument  and  also
         the expert report, pointing out that the expert had  been  approved
         in the country guidance case of SB (risk on return - illegal  exit)
         Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 00053. He urged to be to depart  from  SB  and
         find the Appellant would be at risk for that reason.

    My Findings

    56.  I do not accept the Appellant in this case has genuinely converted
         from Islam to Christianity for the following reasons.

    57.  It seems clear from the Appellant's evidence about  his  knowledge
         of Islam, the fact that he did not undergo any  classes  about  the
         Koran in Iran and about  his  parents'  apparent  attitude  to  his
         claimed conversion, that he  comes  from  a  family  which  is  not
         particularly religious. His knowledge about Islam as  displayed  at
         the hearing was minimal. His knowledge  about  Christianity,  apart
         from having  learned  some  of  the  stories  from  the  Bible  was
         similarly lacking. Although he was able to talk about  the  Father,
         Son and Holy Ghost he was unable to describe what  the  differences
         in the two faiths are. He was pressed for some time on  this  point
         and all he could say was that Muslims kill each other and are cruel
         whereas Christians are  kind  to  each  other.  That  is  not  only
         incorrect but displays ignorance about both religions.

    58.  What the Appellant described about liking Christianity had more of
         a flavour of a liking for life in the UK as opposed to life in  the
         strict regime which is Iran. He described enjoying the  freedom  to
         express himself, to act as he chooses, to go  where  he  wants.  He
         described the kindness he encounters which differs, he  said,  from
         Islam. The reality of what he was describing, it  appeared  to  me,
         was the difference of life in general in the multi-cultural, multi-
         faith society which is the UK as compared with Iran.

    59.  From what I was told about the churches both  in  Swansea  and  in
         Manchester, they appear to have more of a flavour of a social  club
         for people with a similar background, in this case  Iranians,  than
         any true religious identity. I have  concerns  that  both  churches
         actively target Iranian asylum seekers. If it is their aim to  help
         these people and to offer support, solace and friendship then  that
         is laudable. However, it will be well known amongst Iranian  asylum
         seekers that conversion to  Christianity  is  a  route  to  refugee
         status in the UK and I have no doubt  that  if  they  do  not  know
         already  that  is  made  clear  to  them  when  they   meet   these
         "evangelising" Iranian "converts".

    60.  I have no doubt Pastor Robling's intentions are good and  that  he
         believes what he says. However, it also displays,  in  my  view,  a
         level of na�vet� to accept as genuine that someone has converted to
         Christianity before his eyes the first time that  he  went  to  the
         church and the first time he met him, which was his evidence.

    61.  I also have concerns that the church in Swansea has  such  a  vast
         number of converts from Islam (70 to 80 in 11 years).  It  was  the
         evidence of the Pastor that the vast majority of  those  no  longer
         attend. Whilst it is his view that  the  reasons  relate  to  being
         moved by NASS or moving for work, it is equally  likely  that  once
         they have received refugee status the pretence to have converted is
         dropped.

    62.  I have similar  concerns  about  the  church  in  Manchester.  The
         evidence was  clear  that  they  blatantly  target  Iranian  asylum
         seekers as they go to report at the  Home  Office  premises.  Given
         that they are seeking asylum in the UK they will be all  too  ready
         to accept the offer of conversion to a faith with will secure  them
         that goal whether genuine or otherwise. There  will  of  course  be
         genuine converts but I do not believe this Appellant to be  one  of
         them. His "evangelising" is I find motivated by a wish  to  support
         and help fellow Iranian asylum seekers rather than truly wishing to
         promote a faith that he genuinely holds.

    63.  This Appellant, I find,  is  not  a  person  who  is  particularly
         religious either in Iran or in the UK and it seems  his  family  is
         the same.

    64.  The two other witnesses are friends of his,  fellow  Iranians  who
         have been recognised as refugees because of Christian conversion. I
         find they cannot be viewed as independent. One has  been  asked  to
         look after the Appellant by his parents in the UK and his coming to
         give evidence is I find no more than his fulfilling  that  request.
         It is quite clear that he was not truthful in his  evidence  before
         me because he was quite positive that he sees the Appellant two  or
         three times a week, every week where the Appellant's clear evidence
         was that he only comes to Manchester every fortnight usually.  That
         is unsurprising given that  the  rail  fare  is  �18  and  he  only
         received �36 a week  NASS  support.  If  the  Appellant  came  more
         frequently, financed by this witness he would  have  said  so.  The
         fact that the witness was prepared to lie  in  his  evidence  means
         that I can attach no weight to his evidence.

    65.  The fact that the Appellant's parents contacted this witness  from
         Iran asking him  to  help  the  Appellant  and  the  fact  that  he
         travelled to see him in Swansea a month  after  his  arrival  which
         coincided with the timing of the Appellant's attending  church  and
         claimed conversion would suggest that the Appellant's  claim  based
         on his  Christian  conversion  was  prearranged  and  that  he  was
         assisted in this by this witness  and  by  his  parents.   While  I
         acknowledge this to be  speculative  it  is  a  far  more  credible
         scenario that the Appellant's claim to  have  let  Jesus  into  his
         heart on his first meeting with the Pastor.

    66.  The other witness is also a friend of the Appellant  and  also  an
         Iranian Christian convert and for  that  reason  I  find  I  cannot
         accept his independence. Furthermore, he has not been aware of what
         the Appellant has been doing for the past eight months and  so  his
         evidence is not useful in any event.

    67.  The guidance of Dorodian tells me that I should expect a Pastor to
         attend  the  hearing.   While  Pastor  Robling  attended  and  gave
         evidence, he has not been the Appellant's Pastor since  July  2013.
         Since then his pastor has been Pastor Sheila Murphy  of  the  World
         Harvest Bible Church in Manchester.  She has  written  two  letters
         supporting the Appellant but not attended at the hearing before  me
         or indeed the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.   Furthermore
         her most recent letter is at best inaccurate.  She  says  that  the
         Appellant has been attending the church since July 2013 and that he
         attends the Sunday morning worship service and also the bible basic
         foundation course every  Thursday  evening.   That  does  not  even
         accord with the Appellant's own evidence that  he  attends  usually
         only fortnightly since  he  moved  to  Wrexham  in  late  2014.   I
         therefore attach no weight to her evidence.  It  is  also  of  note
         that neither of her letters  suggests  any  policy  not  to  attend
         hearings.

    68.  I also find it detracts from the  Appellant's  case  that  despite
         having lived in Wrexham since late 2014 and despite there being  an
         evangelical Christian church there he has chosen not to attend.  It
         is his evidence that he has been attending  English  classes  since
         2012 and that he is more confident in English.  That being the case
         if he really had converted to be an evangelical Christian he  would
         worship and evangelise in Wrexham and yet he does not.   That  adds
         support for my finding that what he is interested in is socialising
         with other Iranians rather than attending Christian services.

    69.  Having found that the Appellant is  not  a  genuine  convert  from
         Islam to Christianity I need to consider risk on return as a person
         who  left  Iran  illegally.   He  will  be  questioned  on  return.
         However, as he is not a Christian convert but  rather  an  economic
         migrant, then he has nothing to fear.   He  will  not  say  he  has
         converted to Christianity in the UK because he has not.  He  has  a
         supportive family  to  return  to.   The  Appellant  has  not  been
         politically active  or  displayed  publicly  anything  against  the
         Iranian regime and there is nothing to discover that would put  him
         at risk.  The instances relied on by Mr Nicholson in  his  skeleton
         argument relate to persons with a profile in Iran,  who  have  been
         convicted or were under scrutiny there before they left or who have
         publicly denounced the  regime  abroad  such  as  demonstrators  or
         bloggers.  None of these apply to this Appellant.  There is nothing
         to suggest that his family is under  any  kind  of  suspicion.   He
         contacts them regularly and they will be able to vouch for him.   I
         conclude therefore that the Appellant will not face persecution  or
         treatment in breach of Articles 2 or 3 of the ECHR  on  return.   I
         also note the recent improved relations between the UK and Iran and
         the reopening Embassies.

    70.  The appeal is dismissed.

    71.  There has been no application for an anonymity direction and I  do
         not make one.

    Upper Tribunal Judge Martin
