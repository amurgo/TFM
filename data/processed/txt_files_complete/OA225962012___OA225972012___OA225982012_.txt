                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is the decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  an  appeal  from  a
    decision of Judge Thanki sitting in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the
    grounds that there was an error of law in his decision to  dismiss  the
    appellants' appeal against a refusal of entry clearance.

2.   The appellants are citizens of Zimbabwe, the first appellant being  the
    mother of the other two appellants, Josline who is  16  years  old  and
    Darleen who is 11 years old.  The first appellant is a secretary.

3.   The appellants applied on 4 July 2012 for entry clearance to settle  in
    the United Kingdom to join the sponsor, the husband and father  who  is
    present and settled in this country.  He arrived in the United  Kingdom
    in  2002  and  sought  asylum.   That  was  refused.   In  his   asylum
    application he mentioned his wife and his children who he  named.   The
    Immigration Judge  who  heard  the  asylum  appeal  accepted  that  the
    appellant had a wife and children in Zimbabwe.

4.   In September 2010 the sponsor was granted indefinite leave  to  remain.
    In these proceedings he has explained that he left the first appellant,
    at that stage his common law wife, behind in Zimbabwe at the  time  she
    was pregnant with their  second  child  Darleen.   He  states  that  he
    supported the family from the United Kingdom.  He visited  Zimbabwe  in
    2010 and at that point married the first appellant.   He  has  returned
    subsequently on three occasions, in 2011 when he remained for a  month,
    in 2012 when he remained in Zimbabwe for six weeks and  more  recently.
    He is a registered mental health nurse.  He pays school  fees  for  the
    children to attend private education in Zimbabwe.  He is employed as  a
    staff nurse at Kneesworth House Hospital and has an  annual  salary  of
    some ï¿½32,000.  There is accommodation for him available associated with
    the  hospital  and  there  was  a  letter  which  indicates  that   the
    accommodation comprises a number of bedrooms, a kitchen, a  lounge  and
    two toilets.  That property is available for occupation by  the  family
    should they come to this country.

5.   In his determination the judge addressed two matters.   The  first  was
    that the first appellant had not provided evidence of her competence in
    English to a minimum level A1.  In considering this  matter  the  judge
    firstly noted the relevant dates - the application for  settlement  was
    made on 4  July  2012,  the  entry  clearance  decision  was  dated  29
    September 2012 and the review by the Entry Clearance Manager was  dated
    18 March 2013.  The judge  noted  Section  85(5)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 under which an entry  clearance  appeal
    is to be determined solely on the basis of  circumstances  appertaining
    at the time of the decision.

6.   Before the judge an IELTS certificate was produced.  That was dated  19
    April 2013 and on that basis it  was  said  that  the  first  appellant
    thereby satisfied the English language  test  requirement.   The  judge
    considered that the application of Section 85(5) and also the  decision
    in DR (ECO post-decision evidence) Morocco [2005] UKIAT 00038.  He said
    it was clear that, whether or not the certificate established the first
    appellant's competence in English, it was not before the decision maker
    on 29 September nor before the Entry  Clearance  Manager  on  18  March
    2013.  He concluded therefore that the Secretary of State had not known
    that the first appellant had the necessary competence in English at the
    date of the decision.

7.   The other issue the judge considered was the issue of family life.   He
    concluded that the parties were in  a  relationship  akin  to  marriage
    prior to their legal marriage in 2010.  The fact that the appellant had
    retuned to Zimbabwe on  three  occasions  since  he  had  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain satisfied him to the relevant standard  that
    the first appellant and the sponsor were in a durable relationship  and
    intended  to  spend  their  lives  together  as   husband   and   wife.
    Nonetheless the judge said that there was no evidence before  him  that
    the appellants had Article 8 family life rights between  the  time  the
    sponsor arrived in the  United  Kingdom  in  2002  and  his  return  to
    Zimbabwe for the first time in 2010.  Any family  life  that  they  had
    together was constituted by the three visits by the sponsor since 2010.
     Therefore there were no family life rights engaged in the  refusal  of
    entry clearance by the Entry Clearance Officer.  He therefore concluded
    that Article 8 ECHR  rights  could  not  be  used  to  plug  the  first
    appellant's inability to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules
    as at the date of the decision.

8.   The first issue in our view is the  issue  of  family  life.   That  is
    essentially a question of fact.  We accept that separation,  especially
    over a substantial period of  years,  can  result  in  individuals  not
    feeling the commitment necessary to establish family  life.   That  was
    the conclusion of the  judge.   With  great  respect  however  we  have
    concluded that the judge was in error in this regard.  The sponsor  had
    left Zimbabwe in 2002  when  the  first  appellant  was  pregnant  with
    Darleen and Josline had already been born.  There was  a  statement  to
    the effect that he had been living with the first appellant  before  he
    left Zimbabwe.  In the asylum claim in 2006 he mentioned his  wife  and
    children  who  he  named  and  the  judge  who  considered  the  asylum
    application at that time accepted that he had a wife  and  children  in
    Zimbabwe.  The judge  also  accepted  that  there  was  now  a  durable
    relationship and that the couple intended to spend their lives together
    with their children.  As soon as his immigration status  was  clarified
    in 2010 he returned to Zimbabwe and, as we have said,  he  returned  on
    four occasions.  Thus, in our view, there was evidence  to  the  effect
    and we have concluded that there was family life.

9.   The issue then becomes  what  is  the  implication  of  that  for  this
    appeal.  Mr  Scott  on  behalf  of  the  appellants  submits  that  the
    appellants have  now  effectively  met  all  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The only  defect  was  that  at  the  time  of  the
    application the language test had not been met.  He points  us  firstly
    to the fact that the certificate is now available but  also  highlights
    the explanation given, namely that at the time of the  applications  it
    was believed that the first  appellant  was  exempt  from  the  English
    language requirement because Zimbabwe was an  English-speaking  country
    and it was only subsequently when refusals were received  that  it  was
    realised that the  certificate  should  have  been  produced.   In  his
    submission the gap has now been plugged and given that  we  have  found
    that there was family life that is sufficient and should be taken  into
    account.  It would  in  his  submission  be  disproportionate  for  the
    applicants  to  be  refused  on  the  basis  of  the  English  language
    requirement.

10.  With some regret we have come  to  the  opposite  conclusion.   In  his
    submissions Mr Laws accepted that this was a near miss case.  The  fact
    was that the first appellant  had  not  produced  an  English  language
    certificate at  the  time  of  the  application  or  before  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager.  There was a very clear failure to meet  the  Rules.
    There is clear authority from the Court of Appeal in  Miah  that  in  a
    near miss case it is not possible  through  Article  8  to  remedy  the
    defect.  We note that the steps which the appellants need to  take  are
    clear and relatively straightforward.  They can re-apply,  albeit  that
    there is a delay involved and albeit that there will be a cost.  In our
    view though there is this perfectly simple way of overcoming the  issue
    and the failure to meet the Immigration Rules.

11.  In passing we note that the sponsor had ILR  from  2010  and  it  would
    have been possible at that point to make the application.  We also note
    the position of the children.  In entry clearance cases  such  as  this
    their position does not feature as prominently as  it  would  in  other
    cases - see SG [2012] UKUT 00265 (IAC) at paragraph 53  and  MK  [2011]
    UKUT 00472 (IAC).  Nonetheless we have considered the position  of  the
    children with some care.  There is no evidence before us of any evident
    consequences of the children remaining in Zimbabwe as opposed to coming
    to this country.  There is no  suggestion  in  the  evidence  that  the
    education that they are  receiving  there  is  worse  than  they  would
    receive here.  Earlier we mentioned the fact that the sponsor is paying
    for the children to receive education in Zimbabwe.  There is the  issue
    that the children are not with their father but  we  simply  note  that
    they have been separated from him for a considerable  period,  2002  to
    2010 with no visits and since then with only occasional visits.  In our
    view therefore there is no strong  if  any  evidence  that  their  best
    interests would be served by being here whatever the position might  in
    reality be.  That being the case we dismiss the appeal.
