Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. A Miah, of Counsel, instructed by Lee Valley
Solicitors.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State has been granted permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal against a  determination  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  ("FtT")  A.J.M.  Baldwin
    allowing the appeal of  Mobassher  Nazir  (the  "claimant")  against  a
    decision of the Secretary  of  State  of  31  July  2014  refusing  the
    claimant's application of 30 January 2014 for  leave  to  remain  as  a
    spouse of a British citizen.

 2. The claimant arrived in the United Kingdom on  21  February  2011  with
    leave as a student until 31 March  2012.  His  leave  was  subsequently
    extended until 30 January 2014.  On  14  October  2013,  he  married  a
    British citizen.

 3. The Secretary of State  first  considered  the  application  under  the
    relevant requirements for leave as a partner under  the  5-year  route.
    She considered that the applicable income threshold under  para  E-LTRP
    3.1 of Appendix FM of the Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules
    HC 395 (as amended) (the "IRs") was  �18,600  which  was  the  relevant
    amount for a couple with no children. Although  the  claimant  and  his
    wife had had a child born to them before the Secretary  of  State  made
    her decision on 31 July 2014, Mr Miah informed us that the claimant did
    not notify the Secretary of State of the birth of his child, nor did he
    vary his application for leave. The income threshold for a couple  with
    one child is increased by an additional �3,800 to �22,400.

 4. Appendix FM-SE sets out the specified documents to be produced in order
    the show that an applicant meets the income threshold. In this  appeal,
    we are concerned with the following:

    i)     Para 7(b)(i), which required an applicant to  submit  an  annual
         self-assessment tax return to HMRC. The claimant submitted  to  the
         Secretary of State a tax return for the tax year from 6 April  2013
         to 5 April 2014.

    ii)    Para 7(g), which required an applicant to submit  personal  bank
         statements for the same 12-month period as the tax return.

    iii)   Para 7(g)  which  required  "evidence  of  on-going  employment"
         through  evidence  of   Class   2   National   Insurance   ("N.I.")
         contributions.

 5. The precise wording of these provisions is as follows:

         '7.      In respect of self-employment in the UK as a partner as  a
             sole trader or in a franchise all of  the  following  must  be
             provided:

             (a) ...

             (b) The following documents for the last full financial  year,
                  or for the last two such years (where those documents show
                  the necessary level of gross income as an average of those
                  two years):

                  (i)  annual self-assessment tax return to HMRC (a copy  or
                      print-out); and

                  (ii) ...

             (f) personal bank statements for the same 12-month  period  as
                  the tax return(s)  showing  that  the  income  from  self-
                  employment has been paid into an account in  the  name  of
                  the person or in the name of the person  and  the  partner
                  jointly.

             (g) Evidence of on-going self-employment through  evidence  of
                  payment of Class 2  National  Insurance  contribution,  or
                  ...'

 6. The Secretary of State found that the claimant did not meet the  income
    threshold requirement, which she assessed to  be  �18,600  as  she  was
    unaware of the birth of the claimant's child.

 7. In relation to the evidential requirement in para  7(f),  the  claimant
    submitted the following:

         i) to the Secretary of State with his application, a bank statement
             for the period from 8 October 2013 to 6 January 2014 (appendix
             L of the Secretary of State's bundle); and

         ii)      at the hearing before Judge Baldwin, a bank statement  for
             the period from 3 February 2014 to 9 April 2014.

 8. On the basis of  the  evidence  before  her,  the  Secretary  of  State
    concluded that the claimant did not satisfy the evidential requirements
    in para 7(f) of Appendix  FM-SE  because  he  had  not  submitted  bank
    statements covering the full period of  the  tax  return  submitted  in
    respect of para 7(b)(i). She also concluded that the claimant  had  not
    provided evidence of Class 2 N.I. payments as required  by  para  7(g).
    For these and other reasons (which it is not necessary for us to  refer
    to), she concluded that the claimant did not satisfy  the  requirements
    for leave as a partner under the 5-year route.

 9. The Secretary of State then considered whether the  claimant  satisfied
    the requirements for leave under the 10-year route. These  include  the
    requirements of Ex.1 of Appendix FM, which provides:

         EX.1. This paragraph applies if

         (a)      (i)  the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  parental
                  relationship with a child who-

                  (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of
                      18 years when the applicant was first  granted  leave
                      on the basis that this paragraph applied;

                  (bb) is in the UK;

                  (cc)  is  a  British  Citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                      continuously for at least  the  7  years  immediately
                      preceding the date of application; and

             (ii)      it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to
                  leave the UK; or

         (b)      the applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
             with a partner who is in the UK  and  is  a  British  Citizen,
             settled in  the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
             humanitarian  protection,   and   there   are   insurmountable
             obstacles to family life with that partner continuing  outside
             the UK.

10. The Secretary of State noted that (on  the  evidence  before  her)  the
    claimant had no children and she was  not  satisfied  that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles preventing the claimant  from  continuing  his
    relationship with his wife  in  Pakistan.  She  therefore  refused  his
    application for leave as a partner under the 10-year route.

11. Before we turn to the judge's determination, we draw attention  to  the
    fact that, as will be evident  from  [7]  above,  there  were  no  bank
    statements to cover the period from 7 January  2014  until  2  February
    2014 even as at the date of the hearing before the judge.

12. However, Judge Baldwin found that the claimant  nevertheless  satisfied
    the evidential requirement in para 7(f). The judge relied upon  Sultana
    and Others (rules: waiver/further enquiry/discretion) [2014] UKUT 00540
    (IAC). She accepted the claimant's explanation that his  wife  did  not
    pay her earnings into her personal bank account and that  this  is  the
    reason why she could not provide bank statements showing that  she  had
    done so. She said she had no doubt that the claimant's  wife  earned  a
    sum in excess of that required under the IRs, that the only documentary
    evidence that  not  been  provided  to  the  Secretary  of  State  were
    documents that simply did not exist or which could not evidence  income
    for "the good reasons" given by the claimant. She  considered  that  an
    enquiry of the claimant would have clarified matters for the  Secretary
    of State.

13. In relation to the evidential  requirement  in  para  7(g),  the  judge
    accepted the claimant's evidence that on 15 April 2014, he had sent the
    Secretary of State a letter by recorded delivery  with  proof  of  N.I.
    payments, evidenced by a receipt numbered SF113841470GB issued at 16:37
    on 15 April 2014. She noted that the decision letter  did  not  mention
    receipt of this letter and that the decision letter  did  not  indicate
    that the document posted on 15 April 2014 had been considered. She said
    she was satisfied that the letter had been sent by the claimant, as  he
    claimed. She accepted that "it is likely  that  it  included  the  N.I.
    evidence he is likely to have known would be required" ([20]). At [21],
    the judge said, inter alia, as follows:

         "The [Secretary of State's] Decision clearly did not  take  account
         of the evidence I am satisfied was provided to her on 15.4.14.  Had
         she not lost or mislaid this evidence, I  am  satisfied  she  would
         have looked at the evidence as a whole in  a  different  light  and
         appreciated that it might well be that the only additional evidence
         she would normally have wished to see was  evidence  that  did  not
         exist and could not be provided for the good reasons set out  above
         ..."

14. The judge therefore allowed the appeal under the IRs but  she  did  not
    state whether she was doing so in relation to the decision under the 5-
    year route or the decision under the 10-year route.  The  latter  would
    have required consideration  of  whether  the  claimant  satisfied  the
    requirements of para EX.1 which the judge did not consider. It  follows
    that she must have allowed the appeal on the ground that  the  claimant
    satisfied the requirements for leave under the 5-year route.

15. At [22], the judge said she had also addressed Article 8 for  the  sake
    of completeness. This paragraph reads:

         "For the sake of completeness I address Article 8.  The  [Secretary
         of State] has accepted  that  the  [claimant]  has  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship with his wife and it  is  clear  that  they
         have a baby and, indeed, had one at  the  time  the  [Secretary  of
         State] concluded that the [claimant] had no children in the UK. His
         wife has always lived in the UK and  she  has  proved  she  has  an
         income adequate for the three of them. This, I find,  is  the  case
         whether or not I am right in law in concluding on  the  facts  that
         the [claimant] meets the requirements of the Rules. His child is  a
         British citizen who, like his mother, has a right to  live  in  the
         United Kingdom where they were both born. The [claimant] would  not
         appear to have a poor immigration history or  criminal  convictions
         and it is very difficult to see what proper purpose would be served
         by requiring two British citizens to move  to  another  country  in
         which neither has ever lived if they wish  to  continue  meaningful
         family life with the [claimant].  In  a  case  where  I  find  that
         neither income nor  adverse  factors  are  in  issue,  it  would  I
         conclude be unreasonable and disproportionate to expect  them  both
         to move to Pakistan."

16. It is plain from [22] of the determination that the judge was  informed
    that a child had been born to the couple, as she took  this  fact  into
    account in assessing the Article 8 claim outside the IRs. However,  she
    assessed the evidential requirements of para 7(f) on the basis that the
    applicable income threshold remained at �18,600.  The final sentence of
    [22] shows that her  assessment  of  proportionality  outside  the  IRs
    relied upon her own view  of  what   amounted  to  adequate  income  in
    substitution  for  the  view  of  Parliament  in  setting  the   income
    thresholds.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal in SSHD v SS  (Congo)  &  others  [2015]
EWCA Civ 387

17. About a month after the determination of the judge, on  23  April  2015
    and after the Secretary of State had filed her grounds on 1 April 2015,
    the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment in SSHD v SS  (Congo).  At
    the  hearing  before  us,  Mr  Miah  accepted  that  Sultana  has  been
    superseded by SS (Congo) which we must apply.

18. In SS  (Congo),  the  Court  of  Appeal  held,  inter  alia,  that  the
    evidential requirements in Appendix FM-SE  must  be  satisfied  for  an
    application  to  succeed  under  the  IRs,   because   the   evidential
    requirements have the same general objective as the substantive rule to
    which it relates ([52]) and because enforcement of the  evidence  rules
    ensures that everyone applying for leave to enter  (LTE)  or  leave  to
    remain  (LTR)  is  treated  equally  and  fairly  in  relation  to  the
    evidential requirements they must satisfy. Good reason would need to be
    shown why a particular applicant  was  entitled  to  more  preferential
    treatment with respect to evidence than other applicants  would  expect
    to receive under the IRs ([53]). Compelling circumstances would have to
    apply  to  justify  a  grant  of  LTE  or  LTR  where  the   evidential
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE were not satisfied ([51]).

The Secretary of State's grounds

19. The grounds contend, in  summary,  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  as
    follows:

    i)     The judge erred in concluding that the claimant  satisfied  para
         7(f) of Appendix FM-SE, given that the claimant had  not  submitted
         personal bank statements covering the period  covered  by  the  tax
         return. The judge erred in implying that  the  Secretary  of  State
         would have disapplied  the  evidential  requirement  in  para  7(f)
         because the claimant's wife had chosen not to pay any  income  into
         her personal bank account. The grounds  contend  that  the  obvious
         possibility is that the income in question was not earned.

    ii)    The judge erred in concluding that the claimant  satisfied  para
         7(g) of Appendix FM-SE, in that, she made assumptions of  what  the
         Secretary of State might have done had evidence  of  Class  2  N.I.
         payments been before her and how the Secretary of State might  have
         viewed the remainder of the evidence.

    iii)   In relation to the Article 8 assessment  outside  the  IRs,  the
         grounds contend that the judge erred in law as follows:

         a. she applied an incorrect standard of proof, given that  at  [14]
             she stated that the standard of proof was whether there was  a
             real risk of a breach arising.

         b. she had assumed that the requirements of the IRs were  satisfied
             when they were not.

         c. she failed to properly apply section 117B  of  the  Nationality,
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002 Act").

20. Given the judgment of the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo), we raised  the
    question whether the judge also erred in law in her assessment  of  the
    Article 8 claim outside the IRs by failing to  consider  whether  there
    were compelling circumstances which justify the grant  of  LTE  or  LTR
    where the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE were not  satisfied
    (SS (Congo) at [51]).

Assessment

21. At the end of the hearing, the issue arose as to whether the  specified
    documents to satisfy the evidential requirements in Appendix FM-SE  had
    to be submitted with an individual's application to  the  Secretary  of
    State or whether further evidence submitted to the FtT could be  relied
    upon. Neither party was able to address us on this issue.  Accordingly,
    we  gave  directions  for  the  parties   to   submit   their   written
    representations on this discrete issue.

22. In her written representations, Ms Isherwood referred us to s.85(4)  of
    the 2002 Act which provides:

         "On an appeal under  section  82(1),  83(2)  or  83A(2)  against  a
         decision the Tribunal may consider evidence about any matter  which
         it thinks relevant to the  substance  of  the  decision,  including
         evidence which concerns a matter arising  after  the  date  of  the
         decision."

23. Ms Isherwood submitted that the "substance  of  the  decision"  in  the
    instant case was that the requirements of the IRs had not been  met  by
    the provision of the specified  evidence.  Accordingly,  she  submitted
    that  the  claimant  could  not  rely  upon  providing  such   evidence
    subsequently, to the FtT.

24.  It  follows  that  the  Secretary  of  State's   position   is   that,
    notwithstanding the words "including evidence which concerns  a  matter
    arising after the date of the decision", specified evidence to  satisfy
    the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE must  be  submitted  with
    the application for leave.

25. It is not clear whether the written representations  submitted  on  the
    claimant's behalf  were  settled  by  Mr  Miah  or  by  the  claimant's
    solicitors. In the written representations, it  was  submitted  on  his
    behalf that the Tribunal had considered identical arguments in LS (post-
    decision evidence, Direction,  Appealability)  [2005]  UKAIT  85.   The
    Upper Tribunal was requested to re-list the mater for oral hearing.

26. We have not considered it necessary to re-convene the hearing,  as  our
    decision  in  the  instant  appeal  is  the  same  whatever  the   true
    interpretation of s.85(4), for the following reasons:

    i)     Mr Miah accepted that the claimant had not submitted to the  FtT
         bank statements to cover the period from 7  January  2014  until  2
         February 2014. Accordingly, Mr Miah  accepted  that,  even  on  the
         evidence before the judge, the personal bank  statements  submitted
         by the claimant did not cover the full period that was  covered  by
         the tax return (6 April 2013 to 5 April 2014). Accordingly, even if
         s.85(4) permitted the claimant to rely upon evidence not  submitted
         to the Secretary of State in his appeal before the FtT, he did  not
         satisfy para 7(f) of Appendix FM-SE  on  the  evidence  before  the
         judge.

    ii)    Accordingly, whatever the true interpretation of s.85(4), it  is
         plain that the judge erred in law in concluding that  the  claimant
         satisfied para 7(f) of Appendix FM-SE.

    iii)   This error, taken on  its  own,  was  plainly  material  to  the
         judge's decision to allow the appeal under the  IRs,  whatever  the
         position in relation to para 7(g). This  is  because  the  claimant
         could only satisfy the  substantive  financial  requirements  under
         Appendix FM by satisfying all of the relevant requirements in  para
         7 of Appendix FM-SE. Failure to satisfy para 7(f) of Appendix FM-SE
         was therefore fatal to his application  under  the  5-year,  route,
         whatever may be said about para 7(g) of Appendix FM-SE.

    iv)    Accordingly,  the  judge's  decision  to  allow  the  appeal  on
         immigration grounds cannot stand.

    v)     Whatever  the  true  interpretation  of  s.85(4),  it  makes  no
         difference to the re-making  of  the  decision  on  the  claimant's
         appeal on immigration grounds, for the reasons given  at  [32]  and
         [33] below.

    vi)    Accordingly, the Secretary of State is not prejudiced by our not
         reconvening the hearing.  Nor  is  the  claimant  since  he  cannot
         succeed whatever the true interpretation of s.85(4).

    vii)   In her assessment of the Article 8 claim outside  the  IRs,  the
         judge did not have the benefit of the guidance in SS (Congo).   She
         therefore failed to consider (through no fault of her own)  whether
         there were compelling circumstances which justify the grant of  LTR
         where the  evidential  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  were  not
         satisfied. She therefore materially erred in her  approach  to  the
         Article 8 claim. Furthermore, as we said above, the final  sentence
         of [22] shows that her assessment of  proportionality  outside  the
         IRs relied upon her own view of what  amounted to  adequate  income
         in substitution for the view of Parliament in  setting  the  income
         thresholds, which it was not open to her to do.

    viii)  Accordingly, we set aside the judge's decision. Given the errors
         found,  the  scope  of  the  re-making  extends  to   all   grounds
         (immigration and human rights grounds). This conclusion is  reached
         irrespective of the true interpretation of s.85(4).

    ix)    On re-making the decision,  the  claimant's  assessment  of  the
         Article 8 claim is not dependent  on  the  representations  of  the
         parties concerning s.85(4).

27. In relation to para 7(g) of Appendix FM-SE, the judge  had  before  her
    the following evidence which was not  submitted  to  the  Secretary  of
    State with the application for leave:

    i)     (at page 9 of the appellant's bundle) a bank statement  for  the
         period from 1 October 2014 to  30  November  2014  which  showed  a
         payment on 14 November 2014  of  �74.25  described  as  "HMRC  N.I.
         Contributi";

    ii)    (at page 11 of the same bundle) a document issued by HM  Revenue
         and Customs (HMRC) dated 4 October  2014  entitled:  "Self-employed
         Class 2 National Insurance contributions (NICs) due"  addressed  to
         the claimant's wife stating that her total liability for  N.I.  for
         the period from "00-04-2014" to 11 October 2014 was �74.25.

28. At the hearing, Ms Isherwood accepted that the evidence set  out  above
    was evidence of "on-going self-employment through evidence  of  payment
    of class 2 N.I contributions" because it was evidence which showed that
    N.I. contributions were paid following the end of the period  to  which
    the tax return submitted relates. Thus, at the  hearing,  she  accepted
    that  it  was  irrelevant  that  the  judge  had  speculated  or   made
    assumptions about whether the respondent had received evidence of  N.I.
    payments with a letter said to have been posted on 15  April  2014  and
    about the contents of that letter.

29. However, in her written representations, Ms  Isherwood  strayed  beyond
    the issue upon which we invited written representations. She  submitted
    that no great significance should be attached to the word "on-going" in
    para 7(g) of Appendix FM-SE, given that consideration by the  Secretary
    of State is restricted to documents provided with  the  application  or
    subsequently requested in limited  circumstances  pursuant  part  D  of
    Appendix FM-SE.  In  the  written  representations  on  behalf  of  the
    claimant, there was no  response  to  this  aspect  of  Ms  Isherwood's
    written representations.

30. We are inclined to think  that  there  may  be  some  validity  in  the
    Secretary of State's position in this  respect,  i.e.  that  "on-going"
    evidence  of  self-employment  "through  evidence  of  payment  of  the
    determination [N.I.] contributions" must relate  to  the  date  of  the
    Secretary of State's decision.  We  are  inclined  to  think  that  the
    substance of the decision in relation to para  7(g)  is  proof  of  the
    payment of N.I. contributions as at the date of the decision,  although
    this would not preclude reliance at  the  hearing  of  an  appeal  upon
    evidence not submitted to the Secretary  of  State  to  show  that  the
    requirement was met as at that date of the decision. However, it is not
    necessary for us to reach a  concluded  view  about  this,  nor  is  it
    necessary for us reconvene the hearing on this issue. This  is  because
    the judge materially erred in law for the reasons given at [26]  above.
    The outcome of the decision on the re-making is the same, whatever  the
    meaning of "on-going", for the reasons given at [32] and [33] below.

Re-making of the decision on the appeal

31. We proceeded to hear Mr Miah on the re-making of the  decision  on  the
    appeal. The parties were sent directions with the  Notice  of  Hearing,
    para 2 of which informed the parties that they  must  prepare  for  the
    hearing on the basis that, if the Upper Tribunal decides to  set  aside
    the  determination  of  the  FtT,  any  further   evidence,   including
    supplementary oral evidence,  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  may  need  to
    consider if it decides to re-make the decision, can  be  considered  at
    the hearing. Para 5 of the directions directed the parties to serve  on
    the Upper Tribunal and the other party no later than 21 days after  the
    directions were sent an indexed and paginated  bundle,  containing  all
    documentary evidence upon which it was intended to rely at the hearing.
    No further evidence was filed.

32. Mr Miah only addressed us on the Article 8 claim outside  the  IRs.  He
    did not request us to re-make the decision on the  appeal  against  the
    decision to refuse the application  under  the  5-year  route.  In  any
    event, the claimant's appeal against this aspect of the decision cannot
    succeed, for the following reasons:

    i)     There were gaps in the  bank  statements  at  the  date  of  the
         decision and as at the date of the hearing  before  the  judge.  No
         further bank statements have been  submitted  since.  Whatever  the
         true interpretation of s.85(4), the claimant  cannot  satisfy  para
         7(f) of Appendix FM-SE.

    ii)    The correct income threshold is �22,400. No  evidence  has  been
         produced to bridge the gap between the income threshold applied  by
         the Secretary of  State  and  the  judge  and  the  correct  income
         threshold. For this reason too, the claimant  cannot  satisfy  para
         7(f)  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  whatever  the  true  interpretation  of
         s.85(4).

33. Nor did Mr Miah request us  to  re-make  the  decision  on  the  appeal
    against the decision to refuse the application under the 10-year route.
    In any event, the claimant's appeal against this aspect of the decision
    cannot succeed, for the following reasons:

    i)     In order to qualify for  leave  under  the  10-year  route,  the
         claimant  has  to  show,  inter  alia,  that   he   satisfies   the
         requirements in Ex.1 of Appendix FM. Mr Miah informed us  that  the
         claimant does not argue that there are insurmountable obstacles  to
         family life being enjoyed in Pakistan. He informed  us  that  there
         are no illnesses in the  family  and  that  there  are  no  special
         circumstances beyond the fact that the claimant and his wife have a
         British citizen minor child.

    ii)    However, the mere fact that their child is a British citizen  is
         insufficient. There is no evidence that it  would  be  unreasonable
         for the infant child to leave the U.K. It cannot therefore be  said
         that EX.1 is satisfied. Accordingly, Appendix FM is not satisfied.

34. Mr Miah relied upon Article 8 outside the IRs. He asked us to  bear  in
    mind that we may be able  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that  the
    claimant and his wife now have a child, on which basis he submitted the
    claimant now satisfies the requirements for  leave  under  the  10-year
    route.

35. We are not persuaded that it is open to us to consider  the  Article  8
    claim outside the IRs on a basis that was entirely different  from  the
    application for leave considered by the respondent. What  the  claimant
    seeks to do, by  relying  upon  an  assertion  that  he  satisfies  the
    requirements for leave under  the  10-year  route  in  support  of  his
    Article 8 claim outside the IRs is to use Article 8 to avoid having  to
    make a paid-for application under the IRs. In our view, this would  not
    be appropriate. If he contends that he satisfies  the  requirements  of
    the IRs on a different basis than that advanced  to  the  Secretary  of
    State in his application of 30 January 2014, the appropriate course  of
    action is for him to make a paid-for application on that basis.

36. However, even if we are wrong in this regard, the reality is  that  the
    assertion that the claimant satisfies  the  relevant  requirements  for
    leave under the 10-year route is not supported by any evidence,  as  we
    have said above.

37. This means that the only factors relied upon in relation to the Article
    8 claim outside the IRs are that the claimant and his wife now  have  a
    child. The child is a British citizen as is the  claimant's  wife.  The
    child is an infant. No evidence has been  adduced  to  explain  why  it
    would be unreasonable to expect family life to be enjoyed  in  Pakistan
    notwithstanding that the wife has lived all her life in the UK  and  is
    employed here. There are no illnesses in the family. The fact that  the
    wife and child are British citizens  is  not  enough.  In  all  of  the
    circumstances, we find that there are no compelling circumstances which
    justify the grant of LTR given  that  the  evidential  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE are not satisfied (SS (Congo) at [51]). We find that the
    decision to refuse the application for leave on the basis of Article  8
    outside the IRs is proportionate.

38. Given the limited extent of the  argument  before  us  in  relation  to
    Article 8 outside the IRs, we have not found it necessary to assess the
    Article 8 claim by reference to the  five-step  approach  explained  at
    paragraph 17 of the judgment in R (Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27.

    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law such that it fell to be set aside. We set  it  aside.
    We re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal under the  Immigration
    Rules and on human rights grounds (Article 8).
