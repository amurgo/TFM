For the Respondent:    Ms Emma Savage, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Peru born on 20th May 1981.  She  appeals
    against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Myers sitting at
    Bradford Hearing Centre on 30th January 2015.  The Judge dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal against a decision of the Respondent dated 17th June
    2014 which was to refuse to issue entry clearance to the Appellant as a
    dependant extended family member of an  EEA  national.   The  Appellant
    wished to  join  her  sister  Ms  Judith  Gamboa  a  citizen  of  Spain
    exercising treaty rights in this country ("the Sponsor").

2.   In order to satisfy Regulation 8 of the Immigration (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") the  Appellant  had  to
    show that she was  an  extended  family  member  of  the  Sponsor  and,
    assuming the relationship this meant she  had  to  show  that  she  was
    dependent upon the Sponsor  (Regulation  8(2)  ibid).   The  Respondent
    refused the application as he was not satisfied  on  this  point.   The
    decision was reviewed by the Entry Clearance Manager on  25th  November
    2014 who conceded the family relationship between the Appellant and the
    Sponsor but nevertheless upheld the  refusal  on  grounds  of  lack  of
    dependency.

The Decision at First Instance

3.   The matter came before the Judge on the  papers  who  directed  herself
    that the only issue she had to  consider  in  deciding  dependency  was
    whether the Appellant needed financial support from the Sponsor to meet
    the Appellant's essential needs (paragraph 8 of the determination).

4.   At paragraph 9 the Judge gave  her  reasons  for  finding  against  the
    Appellant on this point stating:

         "The Appellant has submitted that she has been  a  freelance  human
         resources generalist since 2010  and  has  no  fixed  income.   She
         states that her EEA national relative, her sister  is  required  to
         transfer significant sums of money in order to support her and  her
         parents.  Her father is terminally ill and her mother  is  a  full-
         time carer for him and her sister has had to transfer money to  pay
         for accommodation and to meet family debts.   She  has  provided  a
         monthly budget which shows the monthly expenses of the household in
         Peruvian soles for housing, utilities  and  living  expenses  total
         4,798 Pen.  The Appellant has also included a sum for debts which I
         have not included as I do not regard these payments as amounting to
         essential needs.  She receives freelance income of 1,604, financial
         support from her sister of 2,481.30,  money  from  her  brother  of
         1,750 and support from other relatives in  the  sum  of  500.   Her
         appeal bundle shows evidence of regular money  transfers  from  her
         sister.  The Appellant lives with her parents and therefore  in  my
         judgment the money sent by her sister is needed for  all  three  of
         them and the Appellant's essential needs equate to a third  of  the
         monthly living expenses for the household i.e. 1,599 Pen.   As  her
         freelance income exceeds this amount,  I  find  that  she  has  not
         established dependency on her EEA national family member and I must
         therefore dismiss the appeal."

The Onward Appeal

5.   The Appellant appealed against that  decision  in  lengthy  grounds  of
    onward appeal which set out Regulation 8 of the  2006  Regulations  and
    the guidance to decision makers  issued  to  Entry  Clearance  Officers
    (which had also been  quoted  by  the  Judge  at  paragraph  7  of  her
    determination).  The Appellant's case  was  that  although  she  worked
    independently as a human resources generalist the income from this work
    was not enough  for  basic  maintenance  which  included  the  cost  of
    housing, utilities and living expenses.  It was for  this  reason  that
    the Sponsor had had to transfer money to support the Appellant  and  to
    cover  the  Appellant's  basic  needs.    Such   transfers   could   be
    corroborated by deposits made by the Sponsor.  The Appellant received a
    freelance income of 1,600 Pen (at 5 Pen to the � = �320),  evidence  of
    that attached, an amount which  was  insufficient  to  pay  for  rental
    housing which itself amounted to 1,900 Pen (�380) comprising 1,700  Pen
    (�340) for rent and 200 Pen (�40) for light and water bills per  month.
    Evidence of that was attached.  This evidence had not been contradicted
    by the Tribunal and the effect was that the rent and utilities exceeded
    the freelance income by 300 Pen (360).

6.   There was a deficit to be met. The father  of  the  Appellant  and  the
    Sponsor was terminally ill which generated a  significant  increase  in
    expenditure not only by the family as a whole but specifically  by  the
    Appellant who gave her meagre revenue to cover her father's expenses as
    shown in her claim.

7.   The second point made in the grounds was that the First-tier Judge  was
    wrong to consider  that  payment  of  debts  by  the  Sponsor  did  not
    constitute dependence by  the  Appellant  upon  her.   The  debts  were
    incurred because of the need to pay for  expenses  which  exceeded  the
    purchasing power of the Appellant.  The debts  included  loans  to  pay
    taxes and health costs for the father's care.  The  Appellant's  salary
    could not cover these debts.

8.   The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Page on  28th  April  2015.   Refusing
    permission to appeal he noted that the application  for  permission  to
    appeal was out of time  by  some  six  days.   No  application  for  an
    extension of time had been made and therefore permission to appeal  was
    refused.  Judge Page did not consider the merits of the  permission  to
    appeal  application.   The  Appellant  renewed  her   application   for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal arguing that her application
    for permission was in  time.  It  was  submitted  by  email  after  the
    decision was received on 25th February  and  thus  only  fourteen  days
    after receipt of the determination not more than 28.

9.   The renewed application  for  permission  came  before  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Grubb on 16th July 2015.  In granting  permission  to  appeal  he
    acknowledged that the application was out of  time  and  time  was  not
    extended but permission had been  refused  under  the  2014  First-tier
    Procedure Rules. Rule 21(7) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules  2008  now  applied  and  he  was  thus  able  to  consider   the
    application.  He granted permission stating at paragraph 2:

         "It is arguable that the Judge has wrongly assessed the Appellant's
         'needs' and therefore whether she is dependent upon her  sister  in
         the UK:

         (1)  by assuming that her share of  the  family's  household  costs
             should be taken as one third of the total; and

         (2)  by wrongly excluding debts paid  to  cover,  it  is  arguable,
             costs of the Appellant."

    The Respondent replied to the grant of permission by letter dated  17th
    August  2015  stating   that   Judge   Myers   had   directed   herself
    appropriately.

The Hearing before Me

10.  In consequence the matter came before me  to  determine  whether  there
    was an error of law in the First-tier decision such that it fell to  be
    set aside.  If there was not  the  decision  at  first  instance  would
    remain. The Sponsor attended on behalf of the  Appellant  but  was  not
    legally represented.  She indicated that she relied  upon  the  grounds
    for permission to appeal (which I have summarised above).  In reply the
    Presenting Officer indicated that what was in issue was a narrow point,
    the issue of dependency under Regulation 8  of  the  2006  Regulations.
    The Tribunal had set out the relevant test whether the Appellant needed
    financial support from the Sponsor to meet  the  Appellant's  essential
    needs.  (See Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT 00314 (IAC) which
    held that: "Whether  a  person  qualifies  as  a  dependent  under  the
    Regulations is to be determined at the date of decision on the basis of
    evidence produced to the Respondent or, on appeal, the date of  hearing
    on the basis of evidence produced to the tribunal".

11.  The Presenting Officer argued that the  Judge  had  found  that  family
    debts could not constitute essential needs which were confined to  food
    and accommodation.  In any event the nature of the debts  was  unclear,
    they were labelled as family debts.  The Judge correctly found that she
    could not take into account the  expenses  of  the  whole  family  when
    considering the essential needs of the Appellant.   The  needs  of  the
    whole family unit were not relevant; it was only the  Appellant's  that
    mattered.  The  Tribunal  was  correct  to  calculate  what  proportion
    related to the Appellant  and  to  find  that  the  Appellant's  income
    exceeded her own essential needs.  The evidence did not show  that  the
    Sponsor's money transfers were used solely for the Appellant's needs as
    opposed to the needs  of  the  whole  family.   The  evidence  had  not
    demonstrated that the requirements of Regulation 8  were  met  and  the
    determination should stand.

12.  In response the Sponsor acknowledged that she sent money to her  family
    in Peru and that her sister the Appellant was working.  The parents  of
    the Appellant and Sponsor did not work and one of  them,  their  father
    had a terminal illness.  Everything the Appellant earned was given  for
    that and she and the Appellant had to pay debts for a  lot  of  medical
    expenses.  The idea of the Appellant coming to join the Sponsor in  the
    United Kingdom would be that the Appellant would be  able  to  work  in
    this country and it would be financially easier for both the  Appellant
    and the Sponsor to then  send  money  back  to  Peru  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  The Appellant was having  problems  in  Peru  earning  enough
    money to cover all of the debts.

Findings

13.  In order to establish dependency and thereby satisfy Regulation  8  the
    Appellant had to show that her essential needs were being  met  by  the
    EEA citizen, her sister.  What was clear from the evidence was that the
    Appellant was working but her  income  was  not  enough  to  cover  the
    expenses of having to look after her parents including a terminally ill
    father.  The Sponsor was sending money to the family as a whole and the
    Appellant was using that money to pay both the medical  costs  of  care
    for her father, the living accommodation and food and  utilities  costs
    of her parents and  her  own  costs  insofar  as  her  own  income  was
    insufficient.

14.  In those circumstances given that what effectively was happening was  a
    pooling of resources in order to pay for the costs of all three  family
    members the Judge had to find a method for calculating separately  what
    the essential needs of the Appellant would be.  It was not possible  to
    simply take the  financial  needs  of  the  whole  family;  apart  from
    anything else the parents of the Appellant and  the  Sponsor  were  not
    applying to join the Sponsor in  the  United  Kingdom.  They  were  not
    parties to the case and  whatever  was  paid  for  them  could  not  be
    classified as payment for essential needs.

15.  One point overlooked in the grant of permission was that the Judge  had
    found that the money was not coming simply  from  the  Sponsor  in  the
    United  Kingdom  but  a  number  of  other  family  members  were  also
    contributing to the costs of the Appellant and the Appellant's parents.
     The other family members do not appear to be qualified persons  within
    the meaning of the  2006  Regulations  and  the  extent  to  which  the
    Appellant is reliant upon funds from other family members  would  as  a
    matter of law reduce any dependency she might have on  the  Sponsor  in
    the United Kingdom.

16.  Overall it is difficult to see how taking the  Appellant  in  isolation
    from the rest of her family she can be said to be  dependent  upon  the
    Sponsor for her essential needs.  The debts were not as Judge Grubb was
    under the impression, debts incurred by the Appellant for her  own  use
    but rather debts incurred mainly for the medical  expenses  of  looking
    after the father of the Appellant and the Sponsor.  Such was  the  cost
    of accommodation, food and utilities for the family  as  a  whole  that
    other debts may have been incurred to meet those costs as  the  grounds
    for permission to appeal indicated but they would still  not  be  debts
    which could be solely laid at the door of the Appellant.

17.  The Judge had to find a way through that difficulty as  it  would  have
    been wrong in law if  she  had  taken  the  debts  and  other  expenses
    incurred by the  Appellant's  parents  into  account  in  deciding  the
    Appellant's dependency.  I do not accept that there was  any  error  of
    law in relation to point 1 raised by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Grubb  at
    paragraph 2 of his decision to grant permission to appeal.  In relation
    to the second point, as I have indicated the debts were not in the main
    expenses of the Appellant but of her parents.  The Judge dealt with the
    matter in a straightforward way to look at the fact that the  Appellant
    was working and to consider whether her income from employment met  her
    essential needs.  If one strips out that part  of  the  expenditure  on
    rent etc. which is for the benefit of the parents, it is clear that the
    Judge was right in her conclusion that  the  income  of  the  Appellant
    exceeded the Appellant's basic needs.  The expenses of the parents were
    not an essential need of the Appellant and  could  not  be  taken  into
    account in assessing the Appellant's  claim  for  dependency  upon  the
    Sponsor.   Overall  there  was  no  material  error  of  law   in   the
    determination and I dismiss the appeal.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I uphold the decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

Appeal dismissed

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so  doing.
