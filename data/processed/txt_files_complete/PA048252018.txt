For the Appellant:     Mr R O'Ryan, Counsel instructed by Kirklees Law

                    Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    Judge Thorne, promulgated on the 31st May 2018,  to  allow  the  appeal
    against refusal of the appellant's Protection Claim.

 2. I extend the anonymity  direction  that  was  made  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellant claimed to hail from Dubz in the  Kirkuk  governorate  of
    Iraq where he lived with his parents. In 2015, a  man  called  'Sirwan'
    offered him money to undertake work that would "send him to  Paradise".
    Whilst the appellant did not realise the implications of this offer  at
    the time, his mother informed a neighbour ('Karim') who  was  a  police
    officer. This in turn led to Sirwan's arrest and a consequent attack by
    Sirwan's friends on the family home. The appellant therefore  left  the
    family home and, following a night in the police  station,  fled  Iraq.
    His case is and was that he fears being targeted by Sirwan's friends on
    return to Iraq who he suspects are terrorists.

 4. The respondent accepted that the appellant hailed from Dubz and was  an
    Iraqi national. He did not however accept that the appellant had  given
    a credible account of his  reasons  for  leaving  Iraq.  The  principle
    reason for this was that the appellant had initially claimed  that  the
    events triggering his departure from Iraq had occurred in  2017  rather
    than 2015, only admitting to lying as to his whereabouts in  2017  when
    he was confronted with conclusive proof that he had been  fingerprinted
    in Sweden in November 2015. Moreover, given recent  background  country
    information  showing  a  significant  improvement   in   the   security
    situation, it would now be safe for the appellant to return to his home
    area.  Alternatively,  as  a  male  of  Kurdish  ethnicity,  he   could
    reasonably be expected to relocate to Erbil in the KDP.

 5. The judge accepted the appellant's explanation for lying, namely,  that
    he was a naï¿½ve and impressionable youth at that  time  and  had  simply
    said what the agent had told him  to  say  [46].  The  judge  therefore
    accepted that there was reasonable degree of likelihood that  the  core
    of the appellant's account was true [44]. The judge  further  concluded
    that there was insufficiently clear and cogent evidence for him to find
    that the appellant's  home  area  was  no  longer  contested  [52].  He
    therefore found that the appellant continued to face  a  real  risk  of
    suffering serious harm due indiscriminate violence on  return  to  that
    area [53]. He also found that the appellant was without family,  social
    or cultural ties to Baghdad and thus faced a real risk  of  destitution
    on return to that city, "as a lone child with no experience  of  living
    in Baghdad" [54, 55].

Discussion

 6. There are three grounds of appeal, which I shall take in turn.

 7. The first ground is that the judge  erred  in  his  assessment  of  the
    background country information concerning the safety of return  to  the
    appellant's home area and/or failed to provide adequate reasons for his
    conclusion in that regard. The information upon  which  the  respondent
    relied is summarised at paragraphs 78 to 84 of  the  letter  explaining
    the respondent's reasons for refusing the appellant's Protection Claim.
    It is taken from the  relevant  Country  Policy  and  Information  Note
    (CPIN) and states that (a) Daesh have lost territory in Iraq, (b) Iraqi
    government and associated forces have regained control of  some  areas,
    (d) the level of violence has declined, and  (e)  internally  displaced
    persons (IDPs) are now returning to their home  areas.  Return  to  the
    Kirkuk governorate is therefore said to be now generally possible  with
    the exception of those parts in and around Hawija.

 8. The judge dealt extremely briefly  with  the  evidence  concerning  the
    security situation in Iraq at paragraph 52 -

         I have considered all the most up to date information submitted  by
         the parties and conclude that there is inadequate cogent and  clear
         evidence before me so as to allow me to  depart  from  the  general
         country guidance in the case of AA v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 944.

 9. Mr O'Ryan was hard pressed to claim that the above adequately explained
    why the judge felt that the  evidence  in  the  CPIN  did  not  justify
    departing from the decision in AA v SSHD.   He  nevertheless  submitted
    that any failing in that regard was immaterial given that (a) the  onus
    of establishing that the Tribunal should depart from the findings in AA
    (in which it was found that the entirety of the Kirkuk governate was  a
    'contested area') rested upon the  Secretary  of  State,  and  (b)  the
    evidence in the CPIN was contradictory and did not in any event support
    the claims made by the respondent as to the risk on return. In  support
    of the latter submission, he pointed  out  that  (a)  the  parties  had
    agreed in the more recent decision of BB (Returns to  Iraq)  CG  [2017]
    UKUT 00018 (IAC) that the security situation outside Baghdad  continued
    to be extremely fluid,  (b)  there  was  a  contradiction  between  the
    assertion in the CPIN that there were  no  areas  in  Iraq  under  ISIS
    control and its acceptance that there were some areas of continued risk
    of serious harm due to ISIS control, and (c)  the  number  of  security
    incident had increased by December 2016 when compared with  April  2015
    and, likewise, there had been an increase in  the  number  of  civilian
    fatalities between April 2015 and January 2017. I agree. I  would  also
    point out that given that the respondent accepted there were some areas
    of the Kirkuk governorate (in and around Hawija) that continued  to  be
    contested, it was  incumbent  on  the  Secretary  of  State  to  adduce
    evidence that the appellant's home in Dubz was not within such areas if
    he was to make good his argument. There was in fact  no  such  evidence
    before the Tribunal. I therefore conclude that this  ground  of  appeal
    has not been made out.

10. The second ground of appeal  is  that  the  appellant's  youth  was  an
    insufficient reason for the Tribunal to accept his explanation that  he
    had been simply following his agent's instructions in falsely  claiming
    that he had left Iraq in 2017 rather than 2015 (see paragraphs 4 and 5,
    above). It may well be that many if not most judges would have found it
    to be something of a stretch to accept this  as  being  a  satisfactory
    explanation  for  the  substantial  discrepancy  in   the   appellant's
    timeline. It was nevertheless reasonably open to the judge to accept it
    on the evidence that was before him. The claim to the contrary  is  not
    in my judgement even arguable.

11. The third ground is that in finding that the appellant would be  unable
    to secure the means to fly from Baghdad (to which the respondent  would
    return  him)  to  Erbil,  the  judge  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
    availability of financial  assistance  from  the  Secretary  of  State.
    However, as Mr O'Ryan rightly pointed out, it had never been  suggested
    to the judge that such funding would be available for this purpose.  It
    is therefore difficult to see how the judge can be criticised  for  not
    having regard had to it. Moreover, even if it were the case  (which  it
    is not) that the judge could be criticised for  failing  to  appreciate
    that funding would be available to get the appellant to  the  KDP,  the
    judge gave additional sustainable reasons (at  paragraph  57)  for  why
    relocation would not be a reasonable option -

         Moreover, bearing  in  mind  that  he  is  a  lone  child  with  no
         experience of living in the  IKR,  has  no  family  or  friends  to
         support him in the IKR, and  is  unlikely  to  be  able  to  obtain
         employment there, I conclude that A cannot reasonably  be  expected
         to  avoid  any  potential  undue  harshness  in  Baghdad  city   by
         travelling to the IKR.

12. I therefore conclude that none of the Secretary of State's  grounds  of
    appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal are made out.
