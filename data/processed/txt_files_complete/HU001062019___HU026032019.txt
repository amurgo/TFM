                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The Secretary of State for the Home Department (appellant)  appeals
         against the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Easterman
         (the judge), promulgated  on  21  June  2019,  allowing  the  joint
         appeals of Mr Asghar and Mrs Maryum (the respondents)  against  the
         appellant's decision dated 10 December 2018  refusing  their  human
         rights claims.

   Background

      2. The respondents are both nationals of Pakistan. The 1st  respondent
         was born on 20 July 1980 and the 2nd respondent was born on 9 April
         1989. They are married. At the  date  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         decision they had a 4-year-old child and a one-month old child. The
         1st respondent entered the UK  in  2007  and  was  granted  further
         periods of leave, the last period  being  valid  until  11  October
         2016. The 2nd respondent entered the UK in 2014 after  having  been
         granted leave as a PBS dependent spouse. The 1st respondent made an
         application on 23 September 2016 for further leave to remain  as  a
         Tier 1 (General) Migrant, and this was varied on 23 August 2017  to
         an application for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) based  on  long
         residence. The 2nd respondent made an application as a dependent of
         the 1st respondent. It was agreed before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         that the position of the 2nd respondent was dependent  on  that  of
         the 1st respondent. There was no issue taken with this approach  by
         the Presenting Officer at the 'error of  law'  hearing  before  the
         Upper Tribunal.

      3. The appellant refused the  ILR  application  based  on  disparities
         between the figures supplied by the 1st respondent relating to  his
         dividend income from his company  RWA  Software  Development  &  IT
         Consultancy Services Ltd (the company). In 2011 the 1st  respondent
         made an application for further leave to remain on the basis, inter
         alia, that he earned �26,000 as a dividend income from his  company
         between the period 9 February 2010 to 10  February  2011.  Although
         the Secretary of State refused his application, the 1st  respondent
         successfully appealed that decision before Judge of the  First-tier
         Tribunal Fletcher-Hill later that year. Judge  Fletcher-Hill  found
         that the 1st respondent was a credible  witness  and  that  he  had
         earned a dividend income of �26,000. No tax return was filed by the
         1st respondent  for  the  years  2009/2010.  The  1st  respondent's
         2010/2011 tax return showing a dividend income of �25,555  was  not
         filed until 15 October 2015. As  a  result  of  the  late  declared
         dividend  income  the  1st   respondent   was   required   to   pay
         approximately �575 tax plus interest. The appellant considered that
         the 1st respondent  had  acted  in  a  dishonest  manner  by  under
         declaring his income to HMRC and  exercised  her  discretion  under
         paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules to refuse his application
         for ILR on the basis that it was  undesirable  to  permit  the  1st
         respondent to remain  in  the  UK  in  light  of  his  conduct  and
         character. As the 1st respondent's application was refused, the 2nd
         respondent's application also felt to be refused.  The  respondents
         each appealed the appellant's decision  pursuant  to  s.82  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      4.  The  judge  heard  oral  evidence  from  the  1st  respondent  and
         considered a bundle  of  documents  provided  on  the  respondents'
         behalf. From [16] to [38] of his decision the  judge  set  out  the
         respondents' case and arguments, including the  evidence  given  by
         the 1st respondent at the hearing. From [39] to [47] the judge  set
         out the appellant's case and arguments. The respondent's case  was,
         in essence, that whilst he had been careless in his tax affairs, he
         had not been dishonest. He relied on an accountant to  prepare  his
         tax returns for the relevant years and had not appreciated that his
         dividend income had not been disclosed. He did not  have  knowledge
         of the UK taxation system at the time and  put  his  trust  in  his
         accountant. His father died in November 2011 and the 1st respondent
         went to Pakistan and he may have missed the dividend income in  his
         tax return as a result.  The  1st  respondent's  company  had  paid
         �6,000 in corporation tax at the relevant time and there  had  been
         no other issue raised in respect of any of his other tax returns.

      5. In the section of his  decision  entitled  'Findings  of  Fact  and
         Conclusions'  the  judge  engaged  with  concerns  raised  by   the
         Presenting Officer relating to whether the 1st respondent's use  of
         other accountants and the email address provided by the  accountant
         who lodged his tax returns. The judge expressed some concern as  to
         what had caused the 1st respondent or his accountant to realise  in
         2015 that there had been a previous under  declaration  of  income,
         and referred to  concerns  raised  by  the  Presenting  Officer  in
         respect of the death of the  1st  respondent's  father.  The  judge
         found it troubling that the 1st respondent had signed off his under
         declared tax return a relatively short  while  after  the  previous
         First-tier Tribunal hearing in which he had to prove his income. At
         [61] the judge noted however that  the  appellant  had  been  found
         credible by Judge Fletcher-Hill, and the judge  accepted  Counsel's
         comments that the 1st  respondent  had  consistently  declared  the
         correct amounts paid tax in respect of all his other tax years.  At
         [62] the judge reminded himself  that  the  burden  rested  on  the
         appellant to show on balance  that  the  1st  respondent  had  been
         dishonest. The judge noted that, although  the  Presenting  Officer
         had raised a number of perfectly fair points, overall, when looking
         at the points made on both sides, he was not satisfied that the 1st
         respondent was dishonest, although it was "a very close-one thing."
         The appeals were both allowed.

The challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's decision

      6. The short grounds contend that it was "odd" for the judge  to  have
         relied on a previous judicial finding that the 1st  respondent  was
         credible given the problems he identified with the 1st respondent's
         evidence. The grounds stated,

             "It is respectively submitted that although the Tribunals were
             looking at the same evidence, in  the  same  circumstances  we
             didn't know about the  evidence  at  that  point  of  the  1st
             hearing.  Therefore  the  information  was  not  available  to
             previous Judge [sic]. Therefore different credibility findings
             on the 1st hearing would not have been made. It  is  submitted
             on that basis the FTTJ has misapplied Devaseelan. Which is  an
             error in law."

      7. The grounds are poorly phrased and difficult  to  understand.  They
         suggest that the judge adopted the Devaseelan v SSHD  [2002]  UKIAT
         00702 principles and  approached  the  earlier  decision  by  Judge
         Fletcher-Hill as his starting point. This is despite the fact  that
         the judge made no mention of Devaseelan or that he  approached  the
         decision of Judge Fletcher-Hill as his starting point, and that the
         issue before  Judge  Fletcher-Hill  was  whether  he  received  his
         dividend income and not whether disclosed his income to HMRC.

      8. The grant of permission was nevertheless made on the basis that  it
         was arguable that Devaseelan had not been applied correctly by  the
         judge. There was no application  by  the  appellant  to  amend  her
         grounds at any stage.

      9. At the 'error of law' decision the appellant was  ably  represented
         by Ms Everett. Ms Everett at once appreciated the difficulties with
         the basis upon which the appellant sought  to  appeal  the  judge's
         decision. Both the grounds of appeal and the grant of permission to
         appeal  were  erroneously  premised  on  the  judge  regarding  the
         decision of Judge Fletcher-Hill,  including  Judge  Fletcher-Hill's
         credibility findings as his starting point in accordance  with  the
         Devaseelan principles. In these circumstances Ms  Everett  did  not
         advance any further argument in support of the grounds. I indicated
         that I did not need to hear  from  Mr  Slatter  and  that  I  would
         dismiss the appeal.

Discussion

     10. It is readily apparent from the judge's decision that  he  did  not
         feel himself bound by the positive credibility  findings  of  Judge
         Fletcher-Hill in the sense that he had to approach  those  findings
         as his starting point by reference to the principles established in
         Devaseelan. At no point does the judge refer to Devaseelan  or  the
         principles  established  by  that  case.  Nor  can  it   be   said,
         considering the judge's decision in a holistic manner, that he has,
         by necessary implication, approached the earlier judicial  decision
         on  Devaseelan  principles.  The  judge  carefully  considered  the
         arguments advanced by the Presenting Officer and accepted that some
         of the points were fairly made but was ultimately unconvinced  that
         the 1st respondent had been dishonest. In reaching this  conclusion
         the judge took into account, as one relevant factor, the fact  that
         a previous judge found the 1st respondent to be credible. The judge
         was rationally entitled to take this into  account  as  a  relevant
         factor. The judge did not regard the previous  credibility  finding
         as  being  determinative  in   any   way,   nor   did   he   attach
         disproportionate weight to the previous credibility finding. It was
         simply one of the factors upon which the judge relied in concluding
         that the appellant failed to discharge the burden incumbent on  her
         to demonstrate that the 1st  respondent  had  been  dishonest.  The
         judge additionally took into account, inter alia, the fact that the
         appellant had otherwise consistently declared the  correct  amounts
         owed to HMRC and paid tax thereon. The judge had  also  noted  that
         the 1st respondent's  company  had,  at  the  relevant  time,  paid
         corporation tax of �6000. The judge properly  directed  himself  in
         accordance with the appropriate standard and burden of  proof.  His
         decision, whilst on one view generous, was  supported  by  adequate
         reasoning and was one rationally open to him on the evidence before
         him.

     11. For the reasons given above I am not satisfied that the  judge  has
         erred on a point of law such as to require his decision to  be  set
         aside.
