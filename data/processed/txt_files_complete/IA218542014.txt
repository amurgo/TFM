Representation:
Appellant   Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent  Mr Chimpango (Legal Repreentative)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.


 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who arrived in the United Kingdom
    in July 2013. He applied on November 28, 2013 for leave  to  remain  on
    the basis of family and private life for ten years but  the  respondent
    rejected this appeal on February  25,  2014.  On  April  17,  2014  the
    appellant sought a derivative residence card under the Zambrano  ruling
    but the respondent refused this on May 9, 2014.

 3. The appellant appealed on May 22, 2014,  under  section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and Regulation 26  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 4.  The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Somal
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on November 13, 2014 and  in  a
    decision promulgated on November 18, 2014 he allowed his  appeal  under
    the EEA Regulations 2006.

 5. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on November 21, 2014 submitting
    the FtTJ had reached a perverse decision. She  submitted  that  as  the
    FtTJ accepted they shared the job of bringing up their children and his
    spouse was British he was unable to benefit from the 2006 Regulations.

 6. On January 6,  2015  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Tiffen  gave
    permission  to  appeal  finding  the  FtTJ  had  reached   a   perverse
    conclusion.

 7. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as set out above. The appellant was in attendance with  his
    wife.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

 8. Although this was a respondent appeal I pointed  out  to  Mr  Chimpango
    that the respondent's grounds of appeal appeared to have merit.


 9. I referred the parties to  Regulation  15A(7),  which  states  that  "a
    person, P, is to be regarded as a "primary carer" of another person  if
    (a) P is a direct relative or a legal guardian of that person; and  (b)
    P either (i) is the person who  has  primary  responsibility  for  that
    person's care; or (ii)  shares  equally  the  responsibility  for  that
    person's care with one other person who is not an exempt person.

10. Regulation 15A(6)(c)(ii) states an exempt person includes a person  who
    has a right of abode in the UK by virtue of section 2 of the  1971  Act
    and section 2 of the 1971 Act includes a British citizen.

11. I asked Mr Chimpango how the appellant  could  possibly  succeed  under
    Regulation 15A in those circumstances and he accepted  there  was  some
    uncertainty in the FtTJ's decision.

12. I pointed out that it was not so much uncertainty in his decision but a
    perverse decision as the application was wholly misconceived  in  light
    of the fact both the children and his wife were  British  citizens.  Mr
    Chimpango conceded the FtTJ was wrong to have allowed the appeal  under
    the 2006 Regulations.

13. Mr Chimpango then invited me to consider a  cross  appeal  because  the
    FtTJ had not dealt with article 8  ECHR  despite  his  application  and
    subsequent grounds of appeal raising the same. I pointed  out  to  that
    the appellant had not cross-appealed  the  decision  and  he  therefore
    invited the Tribunal to grant him leave to make the appeal.

14. I reminded myself of the decision of EG and NG (UT rule 17, withdrawal;
    rule 24; scope) [2013] UKUT 143 (IAC) and in particular the contents of
    paragraph [46] which makes it clear that a Rule 24  response  does  not
    create a right of appeal. There had been no Rule 24  response  in  this
    appeal but even if there had been such a document filed  this  did  not
    create a right of appeal.

15. Even if there had been a right of appeal  within  these  proceedings  I
    would have had regard to the decision of  Sanade  and  others  (British
    children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC) in which the  the
    Tribunal stated that where in the context of Article 8 one parent ("the
    remaining parent") of a British citizen child is also a British citizen
    (or cannot be removed as a family member or in their  own  right),  the
    removal of the other parent does not mean that either the child or  the
    remaining parent will be required  to  leave,  thereby  infringing  the
    Zambrano principle (Murat Dereci [2011] EUECJ C-256/11).  The  critical
    question is whether the child is dependent on the parent being  removed
    for the exercise of his Union right of residence and whether removal of
    that parent will  deprive  the  child  of  the  effective  exercise  of
    residence in the United Kingdom  or  elsewhere  in  the  Union.  I  was
    satisfied that the removal of the appellant would not  deprive  any  of
    the children of their effective exercise of  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom or elsewhere in the Union.

16. I therefore found that  the  appellant  had  not  appealed  the  FtTJ's
    decision even when he became aware of the respondent's permission and I
    was not prepared to entertain an application at this time.

    DECISION


17. There was a material error. The original decision is set  aside  and  I
    dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.


18. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction pursuant to
    Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and I see
    no reason to alter that order.
