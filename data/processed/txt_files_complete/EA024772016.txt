For the Appellant:     Ms S Pinder of Counsel instructed by York Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Saffer
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 13 June 2017.

 2.  Judge Saffer dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision  of
    the respondent, dated 11 February 2016, to refuse to grant him  an  EEA
    residence card.

 3. Judge Saffer followed the Upper Tribunal decision in Sala (EFM's  right
    of appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 and held that the First-tier Tribunal  had
    no jurisdiction to hear  the  appeal  which  the  appellant  sought  to
    pursue.

 4. In the light of Khan v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1775 both parties agreed that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was wrong in law to conclude that it does not have jurisdiction to hear
    the appeal.

 5. It was also agreed that the correct course was for a  remittal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The decision of Judge Saffer is set  aside.   The
    appeal is remitted to be heard before a judge other than  Judge  Saffer
    at Hatton Cross at a date to be notified.

 6. It would appear that the appellant's wife, reference EA026102016,  made
    the same application as that of her husband. It was refused in  similar
    terms by Judge Lawrence on 11 March 2016.  It is  not  clear  from  the
    Tribunal's file what  has  happened  to  that  decision  however  if  a
    challenge has been made it is clearly in the interests of  justice  for
    the two appeals to be linked.

No anonymity direction is made.
