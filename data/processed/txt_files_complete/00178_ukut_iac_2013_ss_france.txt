For the Appellant/SSHD:             Mr D Hayes, Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondents/Claimants:  Mr S Techakounte (fourth Claimant) in
person




(1)  It is clear that income from illegal  employment  in  the  host  Member
State on the part of a parent of a "Chen" child (Case c-200/02  Chen  [2004]
ECR I-9925) cannot create self-sufficiency for that child (W (China)  and  X
(China) [2006] EWCA Civ 1494).

(2)  The proposition in MA & Others (EU national:  self-sufficiency;  lawful
employment) [2006] UKAIT  00090  and  ER  and  Others  (EU  national;  self-
sufficiency;  illegal  employment)  [2006]  UKAIT  00096  that  even  lawful
employment cannot create such  self-sufficiency,  where  the  parent  is  on
limited leave or temporary admission, must be regarded as doubtful,  in  the
light of Metock and Others [2008] EUECJ C-127/08 and  Liu  and  Ors  v  SSHD
[2007] EWCA Civ 1275.

(3)  It  is,  however,  part  of  the  binding  ratio  in  Liu  that  lawful
employment undertaken by a  parent  whose  leave  has  been  extended  under
section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 cannot create  self  sufficiency  for
the "Chen" child.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The subject of this appeal is the determination by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Omotosho dated 7 November 2011 allowing the appeals of  the  four
    respondents (hereafter claimants) against the decision of the appellant
    (hereafter the SSHD) made on  23  June  2011  refusing  to  grant  them
    residence documents as confirmation of their right of  residence  under
    European Union law. This followed the application  for  such  documents
    made on their behalf by their then solicitors on 21 December 2010 and 5
    February 2011.

 2. It is not in dispute that the first claimant was born in  January  2006
    and is a French national and that the other three claimants, his mother
    (born in August 1976), his half-sibling (born in November 2008) and his
    step father (born in February 1974), are  nationals  of  Cameroon.  The
    first claimant was the issue of a relationship between his mother and a
    French national, which broke down some time after his birth. The second
    claimant  subsequently  met  the  fourth  claimant  and  they  began  a
    relationship. They have not married but it is not in dispute that  they
    are in a stable family  relationship.   The  third  claimant,  born  in
    November 2008, is their issue. The second claimant first entered the UK
    in November 2006 as a missionary and at the  date  of  application  she
    still had limited leave to remain in the UK as a missionary. The fourth
    claimant's date of arrival in the UK is unclear but he has been  unable
    to show he has ever had lawful status in the UK.

 3. In a decision sent on 11 April 2012 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Peter  Lane
    found that the First-tier Tribunal judge had materially  erred  in  law
    and that her decision was to be set-aside: see  Annex.   By  virtue  of
    that set aside our task in this appeal is to re-make the decisions  and
    in that context we have  to  decide  whether  the  claimants  meet  the
    requirements of the  relevant  legal  provisions  as  at  the  date  of
    hearing.

4.   We should mention one procedural  matter.   On  22  December  2012  the
    claimants wrote requesting an adjournment. They  said  they  needed  to
    instruct new representatives.

5.   On 28 December 2012 an Upper Tribunal Judge  refused  that  request  in
    writing.  On the day of the hearing before us only the fourth  claimant
    was in attendance.  He confirmed  that  although  the  claimants  still
    desired an adjournment he was ready to proceed with the case and to  do
    so on behalf of all four claimants.  In the  light  of  the  fact  that
    notice of hearing was sent to the parties on 5 December  2012  and  the
    claimants had left it until a very few days before the listed date,  we
    considered that it remained the case that no good reason had been given
    why this matter should be further adjourned.

6.   We made clear to the fourth claimant that  we  would  do  our  best  to
    assist him in presenting his case, particularly  bearing  in  mind  the
    legal complexities of some of the issues it raised.  We are grateful to
    Mr Hayes in assisting with this process, by being prepared  to  respond
    to a number of  questions  we  put  to  him  as  to  matters  of  legal
    interpretation.  We do not propose to set out a summary of  either  his
    submissions or those of the  fourth  claimant,  as  we  have  found  it
    possible to draw on them where relevant in the course of our subsequent
    analysis set out below.


Principal issues

7.   These appeals are all about the  ambit  of  the  Chen  case  (C-200/02)
    [2004] ECR I-9925 in the light of subsequent UK  case  law.  There  are
    many strands to this case but after having heard from Mr  Hayes  it  is
    clear the SSHD accepts that if the first claimant is a  self-sufficient
    person within the meaning of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 (the 2006 EEA Regulations), then both his  appeal  and
    that of his mother (the second claimant) and his half-sister (the third
    claimant) must succeed.

8.   Whilst Mr Hayes' submission in respect of the fourth claimant was  that
    he did not have a right of appeal, Mr Hayes accepted that in  practical
    terms there was no question  that,  if  the  SSHD  accepted  the  first
    claimant was a self-sufficient person, she would proceed  to  recognise
    that the fourth claimant also had a right of residence.  In addition to
    the issue of whether the fourth claimant had  a  right  of  appeal,  we
    would observe that there is also the apparent difficulty in  him  being
    able to bring himself within the relevant legal  provisions:  the  fact
    that he is not the natural father of the first claimant would appear to
    preclude him from the benefit of regulation 15A (see 15A(7) of the 2006
    EEA  Regulations,  although  it  is  arguable  that  Court  of  Justice
    jurisprudence would not exclude a de facto parent from the  benefit  of
    the principles established in the Chen case just because he was  not  a
    natural parent or in a married relationship with the  second  claimant:
    see O, S and L C-357/11, 6 December 2012). For reasons that will become
    apparent, we do not need to resolve these issues but will  proceed  for
    convenience only to continue to describe Mr Techakounte as  the  fourth
    claimant.

9.   Whilst all hinges, therefore, on whether the first claimant is a  self-
    sufficient person, it is convenient to set out why, if he  is,  he  and
    the second and third claimants must succeed in their appeals.   And  to
    do that it will assist understanding if we identify the relevant  legal
    provisions. The provisions of the 2006 EEA Regulations are  as  amended
    with effect from 16 July 2012 by  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Amendment Regulations 2012.

Legal Framework

10.  Article 7 of Directive 2004/38/EEC provides that:

    "All Union citizens shall have the right of residence on the  territory
    of another Member State for a period of longer  than  three  months  if
    they:

    ....

    (b) have sufficient resources for themselves and their  family  members
    not to become a burden on the social  assistance  system  of  the  host
    Member State during their period of residence  and  have  comprehensive
    sickness insurance cover in the host Member State; ..."


11.  So far as is relevant  to  these  appeals,  the  2006  EEA  Regulations
    contain the following provisions:

         "4.-
         (1) In these Regulations -
          ...
         (c) "self-sufficient person" means a person who has-
         (i) sufficient resources not to  become  a  burden  on  the  social
             assistance system of the United Kingdom during his  period  of
             residence; and
         (ii) comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the United Kingdom;
         ...
         (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), where family  members  of
         the person concerned reside in the United Kingdom and  their  right
         to reside is dependent upon their  being  family  members  of  that
         person-
         (a) the requirement for that person to  have  sufficient  resources
         not to become a burden on  the  social  assistance  system  of  the
         United Kingdom  during  his  period  of  residence  shall  only  be
         satisfied if his resources and those  of  the  family  members  are
         sufficient to avoid him and the  family  members  becoming  such  a
         burden;
         (b) the requirement for that person to have comprehensive  sickness
         insurance cover in the United Kingdom shall only be satisfied if he
         and his family members have such cover.
         (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), where family  members  of
         the person concerned reside in the United Kingdom and  their  right
         to reside is dependent upon their  being  family  members  of  that
         person, the requirement for that person to assure the Secretary  of
         State that he has sufficient resources not to become  a  burden  on
         the social assistance system  of  the  United  Kingdom  during  his
         period of residence shall only  be  satisfied  if  he  assures  the
         Secretary of State that his  resources  and  those  of  the  family
         members are sufficient to avoid
         him and the family members becoming such a burden.
         (4) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(c) and  (d)  and  paragraphs
         (2) and (3), the resources  of  the  person  concerned  and,  where
         applicable, any family members, are to be regarded as sufficient if
         -
         (a) they exceed the maximum  level  of  resources  which  a  United
         Kingdom national and his family members may possess  if  he  is  to
         become eligible for social  assistance  under  the  United  Kingdom
         benefit system; or
         (b) paragraph (a) does not  apply  but,  taking  into  account  the
         personal situation of the person concerned and,  where  applicable,
         any family members, it appears  to  the  decision  maker  that  the
         resources of the person or persons concerned should be regarded  as
         sufficient.
         ...
         6.-
         (1) In these Regulations "qualified person" means a person  who  is
         an EEA national and in the United Kingdom as-
         ...(d) a self-sufficient person"


         ...
         7.-
         (1) Subject to paragraph (2), for the purposes of these Regulations
         the following persons shall be treated as  the  family  members  of
         another person-
         ...
         (c) depending direct relatives in his ascending line or that of his
         spouse or his civil partner
         ...
         15A.-
         (1) A person ("P") who is not entitled  to  reside  in  the  United
         Kingdom as a result of any other provision of these Regulations and
         who satisfies the criteria in paragraph (2), (3),  (4)  or  (5)  of
         this regulation is entitled to a derivative right to reside in  the
         United Kingdom for as long as P satisfies the relevant criteria.
         (2) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-
         (a) P is the primary carer of an EEA national  ("the  relevant  EEA
         national"); and
         (b) the relevant EEA national-
         (i) is under the age of 18;
         (ii) is residing in the United Kingdom as a self-sufficient person;
         and
         (iii) would be unable to remain in the United  Kingdom  if  P  were
         required to leave.
         ...
         (5) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-
         (a) P is under the age of 18;
         (b) P's primary carer is entitled to a derivative right to reside
         in the United Kingdom by virtue of paragraph (2) or (4);
         (c) P does not have leave to enter, or remain in, the United
         Kingdom; and
         (d) requiring P to leave the United Kingdom would prevent P's
         primary carer from residing in the United Kingdom
         ...
         (7) P is to be regarded as a "primary carer" of another person if
         (a) P is a direct relative or a legal guardian of that person; and
         (b) P-
         (i) is the person who has primary responsibility for that person's
         care; or
         (ii) shares equally the responsibility for that person's care with
         one other person who is not entitled to reside in the United
         Kingdom as a result of any other provision of these Regulations and
         who does not have leave to enter or remain.
         (8) P will not be regarded as having responsibility for a person's
         care for the purpose of paragraph (7) on the sole basis of a
         financial contribution towards that person's care...."

12.  The new provision in regulation 15A(2) gives effect to the position  as
    analysed by the Upper Tribunal in M (Chen parents:  source  of  rights)
    Ivory Coast [2010] UKUT 277 (IAC). The Explanatory  Memorandum  to  the
    2012 Amendment Regulations states that:

         "Paragraphs (1) and (2) of new regulation 15A  (which  is  inserted
         into the 2006 Regulations by paragraph  9  of  Schedule  1  to  the
         Regulations) specifies that a derivative right of residence  arises
         for the primary carer of a self-sufficient EEA national child where
         the denial of such a right would prevent the child from  exercising
         their own right of residence. This regulation gives effect  to  the
         ECJ judgment in Chen.  The  UK  Border  Agency  has  to  date  been
         operationally compliant with this judgment by virtue  of  paragraph
         257  of  the  Immigration  Rules  which  will  now  be  deleted  on
         commencement of this amending regulation."

13.  However, by apparent oversight, paragraph 257 remained in  force  until
    it was deleted by HC1039 with effect from 5 April 2013.[1].

14.  As adumbrated earlier, the principal Court of Justice case is  Case  C-
    200/02 Chen. Chen concerned an EU national child living in the  UK  who
    had Irish citizenship as a result of being born  in  Northern  Ireland.
    She lived with her parents  who  were  Chinese  nationals.  Because  of
    income derived from her parents' business in China, the child's  mother
    had sufficient resources to support herself and the  child.  They  also
    had comprehensive health insurance. The Court of Justice held that  the
    child had a right of residence as a self-sufficient person by virtue of
    Article 18  of  the  EC  treaty  (now  Article  21  of  Treaty  on  the
    Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)(  and  (the  then  applicable)
    Directive 90/364. It  was  not  necessary  that  she  should  have  the
    resources personally.  It  was  sufficient  that  there  were  adequate
    resources available  to  her  from  her  mother  that  made  her  self-
    sufficient. In respect of her mother (who was her primary  carer),  the
    Court recognised that she was also entitled to  reside  in  the  UK  in
    order to permit the child to exercise or enjoy its  own  EU  right.  At
    [45] the Court said:
         "... a refusal to allow the parent, whether a national of a  Member
         State or a national of anon-member country, who is the carer  of  a
         child to whom Article 18 EC and Directive 90/364 grant a  right  of
         residence, to reside with that child in the host Member State would
         deprive the child's right of residence of any useful effect. It  is
         clear that enjoyment by a young  child  of  a  right  of  residence
         necessarily implies that the child is entitled to be accompanied by
         the person who is his or her primary carer and accordingly that the
         carer must be in a position to reside with the child  in  the  host
         Member State for the duration of such residence ... ."
15.  In W (China) and X (China) [2006] EWCA Civ 1494  the  Court  of  Appeal
    had to decide, applying Chen, the case of two nationals of China  whose
    child had acquired  Irish  citizenship  and,  therefore,  EU  or  Union
    citizenship.  They had come to the UK in 2002 and sought to rely on  an
    EU right of residence based on their  illegal  employment  here.   They
    contended that their savings from  this  employment  meant  that  their
    child, Q, was a self-sufficient person  under  Article  18  of  the  EC
    treaty and Directive 90/364.  In the subsequent case of Liu (see below)
    at [12] Buxton LJ summarised the conclusions of the Court in W  (China)
    as follows:
         "i)  Applying paragraph 45 of Chen, the right  of  residence  of  a
             minor could only be effectively asserted with the presence and
             support of a carer or guardian, and that, if the  requirements
             of the Directives are  fulfilled,  creates  a  right  for  the
             parent to reside with the child, (W (China) [6]);
         ii)  All of the minor EU citizen and his non-EU citizen carers have
             to  fulfil  the  Directive  requirements   of   (a)   sickness
             insurance; (b) sufficiency of means: (W (China) [8]);
         iii)     Those conditions are pre-conditions to  the  existence  of
             the article 18 right in any given case,  and  thus  the  right
             does not  exist  until  those  conditions  are  fulfilled:  (W
             (China) [16]);
         iv)  The pre-condition of sufficiency of means cannot be  fulfilled
             by funds derived from employment that is precarious because it
             is unlawful: (W (China) [14]);
         v)   The member state is under no obligation to adjust its domestic
             law in order to make available to  the  EU  citizen  resources
             that will enable  him  to  fulfil  the  pre-condition  to  the
             existence of the Article 18 right: (W (China) [16])."
16.  Concerning (ii)(a) above,  the  Court  held  that  the  requirement  of
    sickness insurance  is  not  automatically  fulfilled  because  of  the
    availability of free health care under  the  NHS  [9-13]).   Concerning
    (ii)(b), the Court stated that in assessing  whether  a  Union  citizen
    child is self-sufficient it is necessary for the accompanying parent or
    parents themselves to have health insurance and sufficient resources to
    ensure that neither they nor the child becomes a burden on  the  social
    assistance system of the host  member  State  during  their  period  of
    residence [6]-[8].  (Put another way, a holistic  approach  looking  at
    the resources of the family unit overall has to be taken to  assessment
    of self-sufficiency.)


17.  In analysing whether earnings from employment undertaken  by  a  parent
    or parents in the host Member State could  make  the  EU/Union  citizen
    child self-sufficient  the  Court  held  that  resources  derived  from
    employment of the Union citizen  child's  parent  or  parents  that  is
    illegal cannot create self-sufficiency of the child.  It is contrary to
    conditions which the host member State is permitted to  impose  on  the
    entry and residence of third-country nationals; and, because in the  UK
    such  employment  exposes  the  parent(s)  (and  their  employer(s)  to
    criminal sanctions it is unstable, insecure/precarious and ephemeral in
    nature ([14-23]; [27] (per Sedley LJ)).  It quoted with  approval  what
    the IAT had  to say about the father's employment:

         "It appears that [it] exposes both  himself  and  his  employer  to
         criminal sanctions.  In any event as a  matter  of  fact,  in  such
         circumstances, the employment and the funds deriving from it cannot
         be  regarded  as  anything  other  than  of  an  ephemeral  nature.
         Employment which has no proper or  lawful  prospect  of  permanence
         cannot be  regarded  as  providing  sufficient  resources  for  the
         maintenance either  of  (the  child)  alone,  or  of  her  and  the
         appellants."

18.  The case of W (China) was first considered by the UKAIT in MA &  Others
    (EU national: self-sufficiency; lawful  employment)  Bangladesh  [2006]
    UKAIT 00090. The Tribunal concluded that self-sufficiency could not  be
    established by reliance upon  income  derived  from  either  lawful  or
    illegal lawful employment in the UK by the parent of an EU child  where
    the parent was in the UK on limited leave for a temporary  or  specific
    purpose or temporary admission in situations and where that  parent  or
    parents seek themselves to  derive  an  EU  right  of  residence  as  a
    consequence.  At [42]-[46] and [48] the Tribunal stated:
         "42.     First, the presence of the child's parents in  the  UK  is
             not only necessary for her to exercise her right of  residence
             but also to establish it. This is so whether one looks at  the
             income derived from their current employment or, if  permitted
             despite the Immigration Rules, in the future.  The  underlying
             purpose of recognising the derivative rights of family members
             to accompany or join an EU national exercising  Treaty  rights
             in another EU country is not engaged here anymore than it  was
             in GM and AM. In our view, the EU  national's  right  must  be
             established  independently  of  the  presence  of  the  family
             members in the UK before they may derive any  rights  from  EU
             law themselves. This, it may be said, is because the right  is
             the right of the EU national. It is an individual right, not a
             family right (although it has consequences  for  the  family);
             and it must be established on  an  individual,  not  a  family
             basis.
         43.  Second, we do not see  any  basis  for  deciding  that  income
             derived  from  the  first  and  second   appellants'   current
             employment can establish their daughter's right to reside. The
             circularity in establishing the child's rights  and  then  the
             parents' rights is no less apparent in  these  appeals.  Here,
             the child's self-sufficiency is  dependent  upon  her  parents
             working. They only have a temporary basis for doing so for  so
             long as they have limited leave and  are  permitted  to  work.
             Once that leave runs out, there would be no lawful  basis  for
             working. Indeed, it seems to us that it  is  only  because  of
             these applications and subsequent appeals that the  leave  did
             not terminate in December 2005 but was continued under s.3C of
             the Immigration Act 1971. The only basis for  their  right  to
             work would then have to be derived from  EU  law.  The  moment
             that occurred and they derived a right  to  reside  and  -  it
             would have to be said -  to  continue  working,  the  position
             would be  indistinguishable  from  that  in  GM  and  AM.  The
             circularity would be complete - their right to work would  now
             sustain the child's right and through her  their  own  derived
             right would continue.
         44.  Third, our conclusion accords with a proper  understanding  of
             the notion of 'self-sufficiency' and the  distinction  between
             free movement in reliance upon  economic  and,  alternatively,
             non-economic rights.
         45.  An EU  national  who  claims  to  be  self-sufficient  is  not
             asserting a right to enter and reside in another EU  state  on
             the basis of economic activity in that country. If he were, he
             would be seeking to enter, for example, as a worker  or  self-
             employed person. Rather, he relies upon  his  resources  which
             exist independently of  any  economic  activity  in  the  host
             Member state. Once that is  established,  his  family  members
             have a derivative right to accompany or join him. If they  did
             not, the  EU  national's  right  of  free  movement  might  be
             inhibited or effectively  denied  to  him.  In  addition,  the
             central EU legislative instruments give family members a right
             to work in that the host Member state.  But,  their  right  to
             work is not a recognition of the right to engage  in  economic
             activity per se. Rather, it is  simply  a  reflection  of  the
             underlying principle of EU law  because  otherwise  they  (and
             hence the EU national) might be inhibited from  moving  within
             the EU if family members were not allowed to  carry  on,  what
             for them, is an important aspect of their everyday lives.  The
             economic activity of the family members does not  establish  -
             nor could it in the context of an EU national worker or  self-
             employed person - the  EU  national's  right.  That  arises  a
             priori and independently of any economic activity  by  the  EU
             national or his family in the host EU country.
         46.  By contrast, in the Chen-type case the EU  national  can  only
             establish his right by reliance upon economic activity in  the
             host Member  state,  not,  of  course,  economic  activity  by
             himself but rather by his family members. We see no reason  to
             distort the usual situation simply because the EU national  is
             a  child  and  is  dependent  upon  others  for  support  and,
             unusually, is already present in the host EU country with  his
             family members rather than seeking to enter it with is family.
             Here  too,  the  right  of  free  movement  based  upon  self-
             sufficiency  cannot  depend  upon   resources   derived   from
             employment engaged in by the EU national or his family members
             in the UK.
             ...
         48.  In the result, therefore, the reasoning of the Tribunal in  GM
             and AM  is  applicable  where  an  EU  national  child  places
             reliance upon income derived from a parent lawfully working in
             the UK during a period  of  limited  leave  restricted  for  a
             specific purpose or,  which  is  not  this  case,  who  is  on
             temporary admission and not prohibited from working.  In  such
             circumstances, a Member State  is  entitled  to  restrict  the
             rights of employment of non-EU  nationals,  in  particular  to
             limit the duration of their permission to work just as  it  is
             entitled effectively to prohibit their ability to work (see, W
             (China) and X (China)).  When  it  does  so,  that  individual
             cannot derive a right to reside as a "family member" of an  EU
             national because that income cannot be taken into  account  in
             order to establish the EU national's right of residence  on  a
             self-sufficient basis. "
19.  The next main consideration by the AIT came very shortly after,  in  ER
    and Others (EU national; self-sufficiency; illegal employment)  Ireland
    [2006] UKAIT 00096.  This concerned two nationals  of  the  Philippines
    and their two children, one of whom (the third appellant) was an  Irish
    national and hence an  EU/Union  citizen.   The  first  appellant,  the
    mother, was issued with a work permit in Manila on 23 July 2002 to take
    up work as a senior care assistant with a private  nursing  home.   For
    some reason she did not apply for an extension and her leave  and  work
    permit were not renewed.  From  July  2004  she  and  her  husband  had
    remained in the UK  without  leave,  both  working  illegally.   Having
    decided it was required to consider the situation of the appellants  as
    at the date of hearing, the Tribunal chose to  deal  head-on  with  the
    issue of whether the appellants had met the requirements  of  the  2006
    EEA Regulations during the period when the first  appellant  still  had
    lawful permission to work. The decision drew on W (China), Ali  v  SSHD
    [2006] EWCA Civ 484 and several AIT cases, most notably MA and  others.
    Citing  in  full  [42]-[46]  and  [48]  of  the  latter,  the  Tribunal
    commented:


         "42.     We  agree  with  and  adopt  as  our  own  the  Tribunal's
             reasoning and conclusion in MA and  others.  Nothing  we  have
             heard in argument before us leads us to take a different view.
             Self-sufficiency cannot be established by  reliance  upon  the
             income of family members of  an  EU  national  child  who  are
             lawfully employed or in business in the UK during a period  of
             limited leave restricted  to  a  specific  purpose  where  the
             effect of that will be to create rights of residence in EU law
             not just for the EU national but also derivatively  for  those
             family members themselves. In this way, the decision in MA  is
             a complete answer to  Mr  Cox's  reliance  upon  the  parents'
             income up to the end of July 2004. The latter income could not
             establish that the  third  appellant  (their  son)  was  self-
             sufficient and thus neither he, nor the other appellants,  can
             thereby derive any right to reside in the UK. "


20.  The Tribunal thus  held  that  an  EU/Union  citizen  child  could  not
    establish that he or she was a self-sufficient person based on even the
    lawful employment of  his  or  her  parent(s).   If  he  were  able  to
    establish this, an EU right would be founded on a circularity,  whereby
    a non-self-sufficient EU/Union citizen child would be able to confer  a
    derivative EU right of residence on the basis of their employment.

21.  The Court of Appeal also dealt with the Chen child issues  in  2007  in
    Liu and Ors v SSHD [2007] EWCA 1275 albeit it did not refer to  any  of
    the Tribunal case law.

22.  Liu concerned three conjoined cases, all three featuring  third-country
    national parents of an EU/Union citizen child. The third  appeal,  that
    by Mouloungui, concerned a mother who was in the UK illegally.  In  the
    first appeal (concerning the appellant and  mother  Wang)  and  in  the
    second appeal (concerning two parents Mr and  Mrs  Ahmed)  the  parents
    applied for an extension of leave on a Chen basis within the period  of
    their limited leave to remain, but  Buxton  LJ's  analysis  appears  to
    proceed on the basis that they were (or were at least  due  to  become)
    overstayers: see [21]. Buxton LJ addressed submissions that appeared in
    part to challenge the precedent status of W  (China)  by  reference  to
    superior Court of Justice authority and in part to distinguish it.  His
    lordship rejected them both on the basis that W (China) was binding and
    also on the basis of their faulty logic. At [15] he stated:


          "15. It was  principally  argued  that  this  case  differed  from
             W (China).  In that case all of the adults' presence  in  the
             United Kingdom had  been  unlawful,  hence  they  were  not
             permitted to work, so such income as they had was  precarious.
             Here, all of Wang, Mr Ahmed and Mrs Ahmed had been and still
             were  working  lawfully.  But  that  permission  to  work  was
             originally granted  in  relation  to  limited  permissions  to
             remain that had now expired; and the  present  condition  only
             existed because of, and is only valid until the  end  of,  the
             present proceedings. The temporary income  that  has  resulted
             cannot possibly be characterised as  sufficient  resources  to
             support  an  application  for  residence  after  the   present
             proceedings have been resolved, which is what  the  applicants
             seek in each case. And that objection has nothing to  do  with
             whether the Directives  require  the  self-sufficiency  to  be
             fulfilled throughout the foreseen period of  residence  (which
             in view of the ages of the children may be very lengthy).  The
             present ability to work, on which the  appellants  rely,  does
             not even enable the children and their parents to commence the
             period of residency  that  they  seek,  because  that  ability
             expires at the start of that period of residency."

23.  In the course of addressing three further aspects  of  the  appellants'
    main submissions, his Lordship said this about the first:
         "16.     ...First, in placing a limit  on  the  parents'  right  to
             work, and in  not  continuing  that  right  once  the  present
             Section 3C right expired, the Secretary of State was enforcing
             domestic immigration law. It was submitted that that was not a
             permissible limitation to place upon, or a permissible  source
             from which  to  draw  limitations  upon,  the  exercise  of  a
             fundamental Community right such as  the  Community  citizen's
             right of residence in another member state. As stated  in  the
             Directives, the national government is permitted by  Community
             law to protect the national social security system, but it  is
             not permitted by Community law to protect the national  labour
             market: which was a significant objective of immigration law.
          1. This argument was very forcibly put, but it  is  based  on  an
             incorrect reading of the Community legislation. The Article 18
             right is not absolute, for it depends  for  its  existence  on
             fulfilment of the conditions stipulated by the Directives: see
             sub-paragraph 12(iii) above. The parents in question, who are
             not EU citizens, have no right in  EU  law  to  work  in  this
             country unless, as Miss Webber indeed argued that it was, that
             right is derived from their EU  citizen  children's  right  to
             reside here. But the children do not have that  right  at  all
             without the contribution of resources  from  the  parent.  The
             parents' immigration position is not, therefore, being used as
             a basis for taking away from an EU citizen a right that  would
             otherwise exist; but as a factual  reason,  one  amongst  what
             might be many others, for instance if a  carer  was  disabled,
             why the resources requirement was not fulfilled.  It  will  be
             recalled from paragraph 16 of W (China) that the appellants in
             that case disclaimed any argument that the national state in a
             case of incapacity would have to provide  disablement  benefit
             in order to create a right of residence for  the  EU  national
             child, and it was not suggested before us that  that  position
             had been incorrect. I do not  see  why  Community  law  should
             nonetheless  require  the  national   state   to   alter   its
             immigration law when it is not required to  alter  its  social
             security law.
          1. If the present argument were correct, it  would  lead  to  the
             conclusion that W (China) was wrongly decided. However, I do
             not reject the argument on grounds of precedent,  but  on  the
             basis of logic as set  out  in  paragraph 17  above.  Another
             approach to the authority of W (China) was  to  say,  as  did
             Miss Webber, that the case had been correctly decided, in that
             it excluded employment that was unlawful at the time at  which
             the application had been made; but that could not apply  to  a
             case such as the present, where  the  employment  was  lawful,
             under a temporary right to  work,  when  the  application  was
             made. That concession, if it was such, shows the difficulty of
             the present argument. Quite apart from it turning  on  whether
             Ms Wang happened to apply to stay in this country  before  or
             after her eighteenth birthday, immigration law was applied  in
             W (China)   just   as   much   as    it    was    by    the
             Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in the present cases. In the
             one case it rendered the  actual  or  hypothetical  employment
             unlawful now; in the other, unlawful at  the  point  when  the
             employment would matter, on the first day  after  the  present
             permission expired."
24.  Buxton LJ, who also gave the main judgment in W  (China),  then  turned
    to the third submissions:
          1. The third submission affects all of the appellants, but it  is
             of  particular  relevance  to  the  Mouloungui  appeal:  which
             because of the continual unlawfulness of the presence  in  the
             United Kingdom of Mr Mouloungui would fail in any  event  if
             W (China) were applied to it. This submission  was  that  the
             court should indeed look to the future, during the  period  of
             long-term residence, and ask whether, if granted permission to
             remain on Article 18 grounds, the adult claiming  to  provide
             the resources would  indeed  be  able  to  do  so,  by  taking
             employment if so permitted. The past experience  was  relevant
             to that question. Wang and Mr and Mrs Ahmed continue in their
             present employment;  and  Mr Mouloungui,  although  currently
             forbidden to work, had a "job  offer".  Permission  to  remain
             must therefore be provided in order  to  enable  a  parent  to
             fulfil the resources requirement of the  Directive,  and  thus
             make a reality of the child's right  of  residence  as  an  EU
             citizen.
          1. This approach fails for the reasons that have already been set
             out.   By  a  combination  of  Article 18  read   with   the
             requirements of the  Directives,  the  right  to  reside  only
             exists once the requirements of the directives are  fulfilled:
             see paragraph 12(iii) above.  The member state  therefore  is
             not obliged to adjust its domestic law to create  for  the  EU
             citizen the resources that he needs in  order  to  create  his
             right to reside: see sub-paragraph 12(v) above. In the present
             cases, Mr Mouloungui as a failed asylum seeker; and  Ms  Wang
             and Mr and Mrs Ahmed as overstayers; are forbidden to  work
             save for the quirk provided by their  participation  in  these
             proceedings; and there is no reason at all to think that  that
             position will change. But the present applications demand that
             the United Kingdom creates for them a right to  work  outside
             the normal  rules  in  order  to  provide  resources  for  the
             respective children.
          1. To refuse to take that course, as the Court of Appeal refused
             to do in W (China), is not in any way inconsistent with Chen.
             In that case Mrs Chen's resources were proved, extant, and not
             in any way dependent on her taking employment. The  case  said
             absolutely nothing about conferring any rights on  the  parent
             in order to enable her to create the required resources; and I
             venture to think  that  the  ECJ  would  have  been  extremely
             surprised if told that it had opened  the  door  to  any  such
             obligation. Nor is it right  to  argue  that  to  prevent  the
             adults  from  working  renders  the   children's   EU   rights
             meaningless. The EU right is not unlimited, but is subject  to
             the conditions contained in the Directives.  Those  conditions
             include  the  resources  condition,  which  was  fulfilled  in
             Chen, but which is not fulfilled in the particular cases such
             as the present.
          1. I therefore conclude that there is no obligation on the member
             state to adjust its laws, whether its immigration law  or  any
             other part of the national legal order, to enable accompanying
             adults to work in order to provide resources for an EU citizen
             wishing to reside in that member state.  All  of  the  appeals
             fail on that point."
 Our Assessment

25.  We turn to consider the position of  the  claimants  in  light  of  the
    relevant legal provisions and principles. It is useful to set out  what
    would be their position if the first claimant is able to show  that  he
    is a self-sufficient person. It would follow that:

         The first claimant

      a) the first claimant himself would be a qualified person  within  the
         meaning of regulation 4(1)(c) of the  2006  Regulations  and  would
         thus be entitled to a registration certificate under regulation 16.


         The second claimant


      b) the second claimant would have  a  derivative  right  of  residence
         under regulation 15A(1)  and  (2)  and  a  consequent  right  to  a
         derivative residence card under regulation 18A.  Her derived  right
         could only be under regulation 15A(1) and (2) as she  is  precluded
         from relying on status  under  regulation  7(1)(c)  as  the  direct
         family member in the ascending line of an EEA  national  exercising
         Treaty rights, by virtue of the fact that she is not a dependant of
         the first claimant; rather it is the reverse; he  is  her  and  the
         fourth claimant's dependant.


    (b)  the  second  claimant  would  have  such  a  derivative  right  of
         residence under regulation 15A(1) and (2)  because  it  is  not  in
         dispute that she is the first claimant's primary carer;  the  first
         claimant is under the age of 18: the first claimant is assumed  for
         the moment to  be  residing  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  self-
         sufficient person and he would be unable to remain here if she were
         required to leave.




         The third claimant


    (c)   the  third  claimant  would  have  a  right  of  residence  under
         regulation 15A(5) of the 2006 Regulations (and consequently a right
         to a derivate residence card) by virtue of her being under the  age
         of 18, having a primary carer entitled to  a  derivative  right  of
         residence in the UK by virtue of 15A(2); her not  having  leave  to
         enter or remain  in  the  UK;  and  because  it  is  conceded  that
         requiring her to leave the United Kingdom would prevent the  second
         claimant (her primary carer) from residing in the United Kingdom.


         The fourth claimant


    (d)  even assuming he has a right of appeal, the fourth claimant  could
         not qualify under the 2006 Regulations on the  same  basis  as  the
         second claimant because, whilst he may  share  some  responsibility
         for the first claimant, he is not the latter's direct relative or a
         legal guardian (see regulation 15A(7)).

Zambrano

26.  Before proceeding further we should address another possible  basis  in
    EU law on which the claimants might be entitled to succeed,  namely  on
    Zambrano principles.  This point was not raised by the claimants but as
    they were not represented we thought it fair to raise it at the hearing
    and to receive Mr Hayes' and the fourth claimant's submissions  in  it.
    It will suffice to say that we are wholly satisfied that Zambrano  Case
    C-34/09 principles cannot avail this family in the UK.  Such principles
    might conceivably avail them if they moved to France  where  the  first
    claimant is a national, but clearly his rights as a  Union  citizen  in
    the UK would not be disrupted by moving to France and it has  not  been
    demonstrated that the family would not be able to gain admission to and
    reside in France: see Ahmed (Amos; Zambrano;  reg  15A(3)(c)  2006  EEA
    Regs) [2013] UKUT 00089 (IAC).

Self-sufficient Person

27.  We turn then to the critical issue on which  the  first  three  appeals
    hinge: is the first claimant a self-sufficient person  under  the  2006
    EEA Regulations?

Sufficiency of Resources

28.  It may assist if we break this question down  by  addressing  first  of
    all whether, assuming the first claimant can rely in  this  regard   on
    the  resources  of  his  mother  and  stepfather,  his  resources   are
    sufficient.

29.  Drawing on our earlier summary of basic propositions of case  law  (and
    leaving  aside  for  the  moment  the  issue  of  whether  income  from
    employment can assist in such cases), we consider  that  this  requires
    assessing the overall income of the first claimant's family unit  after
    taking into account expenditure: see para 19 above.

30.  In this regard the  FtT  Judge  found  that  the  second  claimant  was
    lawfully employed in the UK as a missionary and that she had savings in
    excess of �4,000.  The FtT judge did  not  specify  the  level  of  her
    earnings but at para 6 noted that the pay slips confirmed her earnings.
    As a result of a direction sent by us post-hearing the second  claimant
    submitted payslips confirming that at  the  date  of  hearing  she  was
    earning �1344.75 net per month. In addition, the fourth claimant's  pay
    slips  showed  he  was  employed  as  a   building   service   engineer
    (electrical) with take home  pay  of  �1,881.26  per  month.   We  also
    received further evidence from the fourth claimant which Mr  Hayes  did
    not seek to challenge,  that  both  adult  claimants  continued  to  be
    employed in the same capacities without any significant change in their
    pattern of income and expenditure.  We do not have a  full  picture  of
    their family income and  expenditure  although  we  do  know  from  the
    documents they produced that the family had to  pay  �76  a  month  for
    their health insurance and council tax of �115 a month.

31.  There is the important issue as to  immigration  permission  for  their
    employment, but leaving that to one side for a moment we consider that,
    even  though  lacking  precise  particulars  of  the  family  resources
    overall, the combined resources of her  and  her  partner  (the  fourth
    claimant), living in the same household, were more than  sufficient  to
    ensure, as required by regulation 4(1)(c) of the 2006 Regulations  that
    they had "sufficient resources not to become a  burden  on  the  social
    assistance  system  of  the  United  Kingdom  during  his   period   of
    residence."

Comprehensive Sickness Cover

32.   The  next  requirement  on  which  we  can  make  a  finding  concerns
    comprehensive  sickness  cover  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  fourth
    claimant was able to assist the  Tribunal  by  producing  documentation
    relating to private medical insurance  cover  with  the  Health-on-Line
    company.  This confirmed that the position continued to be  as  it  had
    been at the time of the First-tier Tribunal hearing,  namely  that  all
    four had such insurance.  Mr Hayes helpfully confirmed  that  the  SSHD
    accepted that this requirement was met for all four claimants.

Lawfulness of Second Claimant's Employment

33.  Another requirement on  which  we  can  make  a  finding  concerns  the
    lawfulness of the second claimant's employment.  As Mr Hayes  accepted,
    the evidence establishes (1) that the second claimant was granted entry
    clearance as a missionary, valid from 20 November 2006 to 20 November
    2008, and was then granted further leave in the same capacity until  16
    February 2011.  She and the other claimants applied for  EEA  residence
    documentation on 5 February 2011, on a date, that is to say, within her
    permitted period of leave.  Since then her leave has been  extended  by
    operation of s.3C of the Immigration  Act  1971.   Accordingly  we  are
    satisfied and Mr Hayes accepts in any event, that the  second  claimant
    meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules and that her employment
    has been lawful (and continues to be lawful  albeit  on  a  s.3C  basis
    only).

Lawfulness of Fourth Claimant's Employment

34.  By contrast, in the application  made  by  the  claimants  in  December
    2010, the fourth claimant submitted a passport  which  had  expired  in
    2006 and there was no evidence he had valid leave to remain in  the  UK
    or permission to take employment or engage in business. The  respondent
    thus considered that as a result any employment he had  undertaken  was
    illegal and the funds from it illegally obtained. The  fourth  claimant
    has not sought to adduce any evidence to counter that assessment and we
    consider it accurate.

Self-sufficiency of the Child

35.  Peeling off the above requirements, it can be seen we have now  reached
    the one that is at the core of this  case.   It  concerns  whether  the
    first claimant can qualify as a self-sufficient person on the basis  of
    his mother's/family unit's resources.

36.  In our view there are  two  insuperable  difficulties  in  the  way  of
    accepting that he can.

37.  First the first claimant can only show sufficient  resources  in  order
    to be self-sufficient on the basis of the family's combined  resources.
    Their main income derives from the fourth claimant: he  earning  around
    �445 a week net; whereas the second claimant earns around �336  a  week
    net. The potential for the second claimant's income to  be  taken  into
    consideration  is  itself  problematic:  see  paragraph  38.   But   in
    connection  with  the  fourth   claimant,   the   position   is   quite
    straightforward. He has never had lawful permission to be in the UK nor
    any lawful permission to work. Thus any employment  he  had  undertaken
    was correctly considered by the respondent to be illegal and the  funds
    from it illegally obtained. The Court of Appeal judgment in  W  (China)
    prevents reliance on illegal employment.

38.   Second, whilst the ratio of the Court  of  Appeal  in  W  (China)  can
    possibly be construed as rejecting only illegal employment as a  source
    of Chen rights, in  the  subsequent  case  of  Liu  the  Court  clearly
    rejected lawful employment as such a source, at least  in  the  context
    with which we are concerned  in  these  appeals,  namely  persons  with
    limited leave to remain under national immigration law (i)  who  within
    the currency of their leave, apply for a right of residence as  a  Chen
    parent; and (ii) whose leave to remain  has  expired  by  the  date  of
    decision but is extended by s.3C of the 1971 Act. Just  like  Mrs  Wang
    and the Ahmed parents, the relevant claimant in this case,  the  second
    claimant, was in the UK with lawful permission to work as a  missionary
    and made an application as a  Chen  parent  prior  to  expiry  of  that
    permission; and is only in possession of s.3C leave upon appeal. We are
    bound by the ratio of Liu to  find  that  in  such  circumstances  even
    lawful employment on the part of second claimant  cannot  create  self-
    sufficiency so as to enable the first claimant to qualify  as  a  self-
    sufficient person.  In consequence we do not need  to  examine  whether
    her income was sufficient to create sufficiency  of  resources  on  the
    part of the family unit and for the first claimant in particular.

39.  We have considered whether there would be any basis  for  us  departing
    from the binding  authority  of  W  (China)  and  Liu.  We  are  wholly
    satisfied there is none. In Liu Buxton LJ did not rule out that in  the
    context of cases governed by EU law a binding domestic precedent  could
    be overset:

         "9.  The jurisprudence that has to be applied to these applications
             was set out by the  Court of Appeal, in terms that bind this
             court,    in    W (China) v    The     Secretary     of
             State for the Home Department [2007] 1 WLR 1514.  That
             authority causes significant difficulties for the  appellants.
             It may in principle be possible, under the domestic  rules  of
             precedent, to undermine a binding authority by showing that it
             is clearly incompatible with the authority  of  the  ECJ  (see
             paragraph 171 of the judgment of the Master of the Rolls in
             R (Countryside             Alliance              v
             The Attorney General) [2007] QB 305)."
40.  He went on  to  observe  that  in  the  cases  before  him  "[n]o  such
    sustained argument was  made  to  us,  though  one  of  the  arguments,
    referred to below, could not be maintained unless W (China) was wrongly
    decided. Rather, the main thrust of the submissions was that W (China)
    was distinguishable."
41.  However, it is clear  from  R  (Countryside  Alliance  v  The  Attorney
    General) that even for such a step to be in contemplation it  would  be
    necessary to identify either a superior norm of  EU  legislation  or  a
    ruling of the  Court  of  Justice.  In  this  case  there  is  no  such
    authority. Further, as noted by Buxton  LJ  in  Liu  in  respect  of  W
    (China):
       "Envoi
       1. When refusing permission to appeal in W (China) the
          House of Lords said this:
          "The correct application of community law is so obvious as to
          leave no scope for any reasonable doubt."
       1. It is to be hoped that the professions, and the Legal Services
          Commission, will take good note of that observation, and that
          these appeals will be the last occasion on which the AIT, and
          this court, is troubled with these issues."
42.  Solely to assist in the context of future cases (and taking a cue  from
    Buxton LJ in Liu in considering the issue purely in terms of  "logic"),
    we would accept that there is a strong argument for saying that neither
    the case law of the Court of Justice nor that of the  Court  of  Appeal
    excludes the possibility that employment undertaken by parents  in  the
    host Member State may create self-sufficiency in the child, at least in
    some circumstances.  The following seem to us relevant considerations:

43.  First, whilst there is nothing said in the Court of Justice  ruling  in
    Chen or in any subsequent cases to indicate that employment  undertaken
    by parents in the host Member State can create self-sufficiency in  the
    child, equally the Court does not appear to attach any conditions  that
    attach to the ability of a  Chen  child  to  prove  his  or  her  self-
    sufficiency on the strength of his or her parent's resources.

44.  Second, the case law could be said to lack clarity  and  to  reflect  a
    degree of tension between two positions.

45.  On the one hand there is the position that  asserts  that  income  from
    employment undertaken in the host Member  State  can  never  qualify  a
    Union citizen child as self-sufficient. This position is based  on  the
    view that where the third-country national parents do  not  qualify  as
    workers in their own right, it would be illogical and circular  to  say
    that they derive rights through a Union citizen child  by  working.  As
    expressed in MA and others at [42], "[i]n our view, the  EU  national's
    right must be established independently of the presence of  the  family
    members in the UK before  they  may  derive  any  rights  from  EU  law
    themselves...the right of the EU national...is an individual right, not
    a family right...." The offending circularity was described in [43]  as
    being a situation where the parent's right to work  would  sustain  the
    child's  right  and  "through  her,  their  own  derived  right   would
    continue". The EU national child's right must be  based  on  "resources
    which exist independently of any economic activity in the  host  Member
    State".

46.  On the other hand, there is the position  that  does  not  exclude  the
    possibility that lawful employment on the part of the  parent(s)  could
    in certain circumstances create self-sufficiency in  the  child.   This
    position draws on the idea that, in Buxton LJ's words in Liu  at  [17],
    the immigration position  of  the  parents  is  a  disqualifier  simply
    because it is a "factual reason" why the resources  requirement  cannot
    be fulfilled. A Member State is not (in  Buxton  LJ's  words  at  [21])
    "obliged to adjust its domestic law to create for the  EU  citizen  the
    resources that he needs in order to create his right to reside", but if
    as a matter of fact her domestic law permits  lawful  employment,  then
    there would appear to be no further  technical  barrier  to  the  child
    being regarded as self-sufficient.

47.  This alternative position would not  appear  to  be  inconsistent  with
    W(China) or Liu. The proposition that employment  in  the  host  Member
    States on the part of parents of a Union citizen child cannot make  the
    latter self-sufficient is not an evident part of the ratio of W(China),
    not at least according to the summary given of its ratio by  Buxton  LJ
    in Liu (see above). That summary only proscribes illegal employment.

48. Against the first position, some of the justifications given for it, at
    least in the AIT case law give pause for thought. It is very  difficult
    to see that the first position can be justified on the basis  that  the
    right of residence  flowing  from  self-sufficiency  is  an  individual
    right. We have in mind here that the individuality of the right was one
    justification given by the AIT in MA & Others at [42]: see  above  para
    17. It is very difficult because, if the Chen right was as these  cases
    assert purely an individual right, then  the  Court  of  Justice  could
    never have concluded that Chen's parents had a  derived  right.   If  a
    child could only be self-sufficient in his or her own individual right,
    without regard to the resources of his carers, then the  derived  right
    of residence  established  by  Chen  would  only  have  application  in
    extremely rare cases (e.g. if he had inherited wealth).  The  Court  of
    Justice in Chen clearly considered that the Chen right could be created
    indirectly through the resources of an EU child's carers/ parents.

49. Another justification given by the AIT in ER and  Others  for  adopting
    the first position was that it considered it was bound to do so by  the
    terms in which the Court of Justice had decided the  case  of   SSHD  v
    Akrich, (Case C-109/01) [2004] INLR 36 as well as by several  cases  on
    based on the doctrine of abuse of  rights  in  the  form  of  entry  by
    deception, most notably R v SSHD  ex  parte  Kondova  (Case  C-239/99).
    However, Akrich was disapproved in Metock and Others (Area of  Freedom,
    Security and Justice) [2008] EUECJ C-127/08 and in that and  subsequent
    cases the Court of Justice has made clear that the doctrine of abuse of
    rights is to be narrowly construed.  As  such  it  is  not  a  doctrine
    obviously to be applied purely because applicants seek to create  self-
    sufficiency by artificial but not abusive means.

50. A further argument against the first position is that, at least in  the
    ER & others case the Secretary of State appeared  ready  to  adopt  the
    second position. At [39] the Tribunal recorded that:


         "We understand Mr Payne' submissions [on behalf of the Secretary of
         State} -which he also made in another reconsideration listed before
         us on the same day - to entail an acceptance by  the  Secretary  of
         State  that  reliance  may  be  placed  upon  income  derived  from
         employment pursuant to an independent right under national  law  to
         remain and work in the UK."

51.  It seems to us that the preponderance of argument does not exclude  the
    second position being consistent with either Court of Justice or  Court
    of Appeal authority. However, we do not need in this  case  to  resolve
    definitively which of the two positions described above is correct.  As
    already explained, even  assuming  that  the  second  position  is  the
    correct one under EU law, the claimants in this case  could  still  not
    establish their case. Under  the  second  position  there  remains  the
    question of what type of employment could be considered to  demonstrate
    such self-sufficiency in the Union citizen child. Whilst in our opinion
    the case law of the Court of Justice  and  Court  of  Appeal  does  not
    exclude employment on the part of a  parent  or  parents  in  the  host
    Member State being able to  create  self-sufficiency  for  their  Union
    citizen child in some circumstances, it clearly does exclude employment
    that is illegal employment as well as employment that is lawful  purely
    in the sense that the relevant parent has section 3C leave. That is why
    the appellants Mrs Wang and Mr and Mrs Ahmed lost in Liu  and  why  the
    claimants cannot succeed in the appeal before us.


52.  For the above reasons:

     The First-tier Tribunal materially erred in law and  its  decision  has
    been set aside.

     The decision we re-make is to dismiss the claimants' appeals.

ANNEX

ERROR OF LAW DECISION BY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE P LANE:

CASE NOS:  IA/24623/24617/24620/24621/2011


DATE OF INITIAL HEARING IN UPPER TRIBUNAL:  11 APRIL 2012


BEFORE: UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE PETER LANE


Representation:

For the Appellant:  Ms. C. Gough, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:  Mr A Jaffar, instructed by Cardinal Solicitors (Luton)


   REASONS FOR FINDING THAT FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL MADE AN ERROR OF LAW, SUCH
                   THAT ITS DECISION FALLS TO BE SET ASIDE

1.  At the hearing on 11 April 2012, by consent, I  found  that  there  were
errors of law in the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  judge,  such
that I should set her determination aside. The judge was plainly not  helped
in this difficult and unusual case by the absence of a  presenting  officer.
Nevertheless,  she  erred  in  not  making  clear  findings  regarding   the
insurance position of the respondents and in ignoring the  fact  that,  even
if the second, third and fourth respondents fell within regulation 8 of  the
Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006,  the  Secretary  of
State  has  a  discretion  under  regulation  17(4),  which  had  not   been
exercised.

2.  Although the determination of the First-tier Tribunal judge fell  to  be
set aside, the findings of fact made by the  judge,  including  the  finding
regarding the relationship between the second and fourth respondents,  shall
stand, not having been the subject of challenge in the grounds.

3.  The fact that Mr Jaffar had been instructed only on the afternoon of  11
April, together with  the  nature  of  the  issues,  meant  that  the  Upper
Tribunal could not proceed forthwith to hear evidence  and  submissions  for
the purpose of re-making the decisions in the appeals.  I  accordingly  made
the following directions.







                                 DIRECTIONS

1.  Not later than 14 days before the forthcoming hearing the parties  shall
serve on the Upper Tribunal and each other skeleton arguments dealing with:-


             (a)  the status of the first respondent as a qualified person;


        (b) the applicability or otherwise  of  the  Immigration  (European
        Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  in  relation  to  each  of  the
        respondents; and


        (c)  the applicability or otherwise of the case of Chen [2004]  ECR
        I - 9925, if the 2006 Regulations are not relevant to one  or  more
        of the respondents.


2.  The skeleton arguments shall be accompanied by copies of  all  case  law
relied on, or which is otherwise considered to be relevant.

3.  Any documentary evidence (including witness statements)  upon  which  it
is intended to rely shall be served on the Tribunal and the other party  not
later than 14 days before the forthcoming hearing.

4.  All materials to be served on the Secretary of State must  be  addressed
to Ms C. Gough,  Specialist  Appeals  Team,  Building  2,  Angel  Square,  1
Torrens Street, London EC1V 1NY.

-----------------------
[1] The Explanatory Memorandum to HC1039 at 7.23 states that "following  the
European Court of Justice case in Chen...the UK  created  paragraphs  257C-E
of the Immigration Rules to provide for entry as the carer  or  relative  of
an EEA national child in the UK. In the  Upper  Tribunal  case  of  M  (Chen
parent: source of rights)...the domestic  court  confirmed  that  a  primary
carer of a self-sufficient EEA national child  had  a  directly  enforceable
right to enter and reside in the host state to facilitate the  child's  free
movement rights. This EU right is not subject to  any  restrictions  imposed
by  the  Immigration  Rules  regime.  As  a  consequence  it  is  no  longer
appropriate to deal with this category of case within the Rules".
