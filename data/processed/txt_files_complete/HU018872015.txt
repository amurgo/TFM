                     ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, Islamabad

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr C McGinley, of Gray & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on  5  August  1990.   She
    married Amir Qamar on 11 June 2012.  He is also a citizen of  Pakistan,
    with indefinite leave to remain in the UK.  She and the appellant  have
    a daughter, born since these proceedings began, on 1 February 2016.

 2. In a decision dated 29 June  2015,  the  ECO  refused  the  appellant's
    application for entry clearance as  a  partner.   The  ECO  gave  these
    reasons:

      (i) inadequate evidence of a genuine and subsisting relationship;

      (ii) absence or  prescribed  evidence  under  appendix  FM-SE  of  the
      immigration rules - bank statements not corresponding with salary from
      the sponsor's two claimed employments; and

      (iii) no disproportionate interference with family  and  private  life
      under article 8 of the ECHR.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge D C Clapham  SSC  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal by decision promulgated on 9 September 2016.

 4. The judge found in favour of the appellant on the  genuineness  of  her
    relationship with the sponsor, and that is no longer in issue.

 5. However, the judge explained at ï¿½17 - 18 that  the  financial  evidence
    did not comply with the requirements of the rules.  While  the  sponsor
    appeared to earn more than the minimum income, and total credits on his
    bank account exceeded that amount, he had two jobs.   He  was  paid  in
    cash for both and not directly into his bank account.  Deposits did not
    correspond with his payslips.  He said at the hearing that some credits
    represented repayment to him of a loan he had made  to  a  third  party
    (not either of his employers).  The judge found that he could not allow
    the appeal under the rules.

 6. The case was dismissed also under article  8,  on  the  view  that  the
    outcome was not disproportionate, particularly as there was the  option
    of a fresh application, with apparent prospects of success.

 7. The first ground of appeal to the  UT  submits  that  the  net  amounts
    deposited by the sponsor were more than required to  meet  the  minimum
    income requirement, and the  evidence  should  have  been  held  to  be
    satisfactory, particularly as there was also  produced  a  letter  from
    HMRC to confirm income and tax paid thereon.

 8. The second ground disputes the outcome under article 8.

 9. Permission was refused by the FtT, but granted by the UT  on  the  view
    that the judge had not referred to the evidence from HMRC showing  more
    than required income, and so  arguably  failed  to  refer  to  all  the
    relevant evidence.

10. The grant of permission does not  refer  to  ground  2.   Mr  McGinley,
    realistically, accepted that the  appeal  could  not  succeed  on  that
    basis.

11. Mr McGinley said that while credits could not be itemised, and  it  was
    accepted that not all  earnings  were  deposited,  it  was  plain  from
    letters from employers, wage slips, and the letter from HMRC  that  the
    sponsor's earnings reached  the  minimum  income  requirement,  and  an
    outcome adverse to the appellant bordered on the perverse.

12. The HMRC document is, unfortunately for the appellant and the  sponsor,
    not among the prescribed documentation for  purposes  of  the  relevant
    rules.  Mr Matthews observed that forms P60 are accepted, but that  the
    appellant had not produced  such  forms  from  either  employment.   He
    pointed out that the appellant accepted that he did not deposit all his
    earnings paid in cash, and had not attempted to relate the credits into
    his account to either of his employments or  to  loan  repayments.   He
    submitted that although the outcome might appear harsh, it could not be
    otherwise in terms of the rules.

13. I reserved my decision.

14. As I indicated at the hearing, I have some sympathy for  the  appellant
    and the sponsor; but I also indicated that it was difficult to see  any
    legal basis on which the outcome of the case  might  be  reversed.   On
    full consideration, I am unable to reach any such resolution.

15. The scheme set up under appendices FM and FM-SE is highly prescriptive;
    deliberately so.  Strictly specified evidence  must  be  produced  with
    applications, otherwise they fail.  With few if any exceptions, matters
    cannot be put right by producing  further  evidence  in  course  of  an
    appeal, or by showing that the substance of rules such as  the  minimum
    income requirement has been met, although  the  letter  of  documentary
    proof has not been complied with.

16. The appellant is unable to refer to any  provisions  in  the  rules  by
    which her appeal might properly have been allowed.

17. The only remedy for her and the sponsor is to  begin  again  under  the
    rules (it  is  to  be  hoped  that  the  necessary  evidence  has  been
    assembled).

18. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

19. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
