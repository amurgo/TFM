                      ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, Pretoria

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Maguire,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The  appellant  has  permission  to  appeal  against  the  decision  of
    Designated  FtT  Judge  Murray,  promulgated  on  20   November   2017,
    dismissing his appeal against refusal of entry clearance as a spouse.

 2. The ECO's decision dated 17 May 2016 refused the  application  for  (i)
    inadequate evidence of relationship and  (ii)  shortfall  in  financial
    requirements.   In  a  review  by  an  Entry  Clearance  manager,   the
    relationship was accepted, and that has not since been in issue.

 3. The FtT took account of MM (Lebanon) [2017] 1  WLR  771.   At  [25]  it
    found that third party support was  not  reliable,  and  the  terms  of
    appendix FM of the immigration rules could not be satisfied.

 4. At [26], the FtT declined  to  allow  the  appeal  outside  the  rules,
    because the financial requirements  would  soon  be  satisfied,  and  a
    further application could be made.

 5. The appellant's grounds of appeal to the UT, set out in his application
    filed with the UT on 25 April 2018, say  at  [3(i)  -  (ii)]  that  the
    reasons given at [25] are flawed, and at  [4  (i)  -  (iii)]  that  the
    outcome is disproportionate, even if  a  future  application  could  be
    made.

 6. The grounds and submissions for the appellant showed that  the  reasons
    given at [25] are not sustainable.

 7. It was of negligible (if any) significance that the sponsor's son  (the
    third-party source) had  not  previously  supported  his  mother.   His
    payment of her legal bills was positive rather than negative.  It might
    be that �800 a month after outgoings was "not a lot", but it was enough
    to cover the shortfall (�350 a month at  most;  it  appeared  that  the
    calculation  at  [11],  on  all  information  available,  might  be  an
    overestimate).  The fact that he was giving support precisely in  order
    to bring earnings up to the required level was not  adverse;  it  might
    have  been  taken  as  positive.   The  reasons  did  not  support  the
    conclusion  that  this  was  "not  a  reliable  source  of  third-party
    support".

 8. Although at the time of the FtT hearing the issue was governed  by  MM,
    the SSHD later modified the rules in response.  Representatives  agreed
    that the rules, as they stand now, apply to remaking of  the  decision.



 9. The sponsor's  income  is  likely  to  remain  short  of  requirements,
    although by hundreds not thousands of pounds.  The  additional  sources
    which may be considered in a suitable case are  set  out  at  paragraph
    21A(2) of appendix FM-SE of the rules.  Taking account of the sponsor's
    earnings together with the support offered by  her  son,  there  is  no
    difficulty in finding that the financial requirement would be met.   Mr
    Govan did not resist that conclusion.

10. The financial requirement could be met even without a  finding  on  the
    prospect of the appellant finding employment, which is  also  permitted
    by paragraph 21A(2).  That has not been much explored in evidence,  but
    appears likely.

11. The rules at GEN.3.1.(1) set up a gateway to considering  such  further
    evidence.  It must be "... evident from the information provided by the
    applicant that there are exceptional circumstances which  could  render
    refusal of entry clearance a breach  of  article  8  ...  because  such
    refusal could  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for  the
    applicant [or] their partner ... "

12. Mr Govan submitted that the case disclosed no  such  consequences,  but
    only separation, which was a matter  of  choice  and  of  the  ordinary
    operation of the rules; and that the exception is not intended  to  let
    in a "near miss".

13. I was not referred to and am not aware of any discussion in case law of
    the criterion in GEN.3.1.(1).

14. The ECO's decision has consequences.   Are  they  harsh?   The  sponsor
    lived most of her adult life in South Africa, and returned  here  about
    three years ago.  It would not be impossible for her to live  again  in
    South Africa, but the reasons for her  preference  are  understandable.
    If the decision is maintained, the appellant and  sponsor  must  choose
    whether to continue to live separately (apart from visits), or for  her
    to return.

15.  There  is  professional  evidence  of  the  sponsor   suffering   some
    psychological distress, which is readily comprehensible.

16. Harshness is a matter of ordinary language,  not  a  specialised  legal
    concept (as it might be in some  other  legal  contexts).   The  Oxford
    dictionary offers "unpleasantly rough", "cruel or  severe",  "grim  and
    unpalatable", and "having an undesirably strong  effect".   The  choice
    before the appellant and sponsor lies  within  the  spectrum  of  those
    definitions.  The decision has harsh consequences.

17. The decisive question is whether those consequences  are  unjustifiably
    harsh.

18. The rules use similar terms elsewhere.  For example, in  a  deportation
    case it is "unduly harsh" for someone to live in another  country  only
    if there are "compelling circumstances over and above" an already  high
    threshold (paragraph 399).  This case involves no such high thresholds.

19. The justification must come from the ECO's side.   The  maintenance  of
    effective immigration controls is in the  public  interest:  2002  Act,
    section 117B(1).  The rules are  designed  to  be  as  prescriptive  as
    possible.  The public interest  includes  provision  of  certainty  and
    consistency (even if through a bewildering labyrinth  of  detail).   No
    other aspect of the public interest  has  been  suggested  as  weighing
    against the appellant.  The rules provide for sources of income  to  be
    widened, if the consequences of not doing  so  would  be  unjustifiably
    harsh.

20. Justification for refusing entry to the appellant, on the facts of this
    case, is lacking.   Those facts meet the requirements  of  GEN.3.1.(1),
    from which success follows on article 8 grounds.

21. The decision of the FtT is set aside, and  the  following  decision  is
    substituted: the appeal, as originally brought to the FtT, is allowed.

22. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
