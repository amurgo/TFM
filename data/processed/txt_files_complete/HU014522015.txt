                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Mrs Shahnaz is a national of Iran born in 1952.  On  the  3rd  February
    2017 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge A.K. Simpson) allowed her appeal on
    human rights grounds. The subject of the appeal was the decision of the
    Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) to refuse  to  grant  Mrs  Shahnaz  entry
    clearance as a visitor, in order that she might visit her  daughter  in
    the United Kingdom. Mrs Shahnaz argued that this was  a  decision  that
    infringed the Article 8 ECHR rights of herself and her daughter;  Judge
    Simpson agreed. The ECO has now sought, and been granted, permission to
    appeal against that decision.






    Background and Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


 2. The following facts are not in contention.


 3. Mrs Shahnaz lives in Gorgan, a town  in  northern  Iran  close  to  the
    Caspian Sea. She has lived in her  own  property  there  for  the  past
    thirty years. She is a widow and until 2016 she lived with her  son,  a
    consultant anaesthetist. She retains close contact with him and his new
    wife, also an anaesthetist, and when they are in Gorgan they stay  with
    her. Mrs Shahnaz has five sisters living nearby and  she  sees  one  or
    more of them on a daily basis. Her income derives from several sources.
    She has her own teacher's pension from the Ministry of  Education,  her
    late husband's pension from Bank Mellat and additional 'bonus' payments
    from various  dividends  and  bonds.  Her  regular  monthly  income  is
    approximately ï¿½750 plus  additional  ad  hoc  payments.    She  travels
    widely.  In the past ten  years  she  has  holidayed  in  Turkey  (five
    trips), Malaysia, the UAE, Thailand and Georgia. She has visited the UK
    twice, once with her late husband and most recently in 2012.


 4. The Sponsor Mr Nezam was born in the UK. He is a  dual  British-Iranian
    national. He is married to  the  Appellant's  daughter,  Pooneh  Nezam.
    Pooneh was very close to her mother prior to her marriage in  2011  and
    even after she moved to the UK in 2012 they continued  to  speak  on  a
    daily basis by telephone and using internet video calls.


 5. In her application form dated 13th May  2015  Mrs  Shahnaz  had  sought
    entry clearance as a visitor, stating that  she  wished  to  spend  two
    months in the UK in order to be with her daughter. She  explained  that
    there was a particular reason for the trip at  this  time:  Pooneh  was
    heavily pregnant and wanted her mother to be with her at  the  time  of
    the birth.   She had lost her first child and they  were  both  worried
    about the outcome of this pregnancy.


 6. The ECO refused the application on the 4th June 2015.  The reason given
    was that the ECO had identified  transactions  in  Mrs  Shahnaz's  bank
    account  the  origins  of  which  were  "unclear"  and  which  did  not
    correspond to her stated monthly income. The ECO was not, in  light  of
    these findings, satisfied that she was a genuine visitor  who  intended
    to leave the UK at the end of her trip. Although the ECO states that he
    has considered the "compassionate circumstances" surrounding the  trip,
    the decision does not expressly address  human  rights.   In  a  review
    dated 3rd December 2015 an Entry Clearance  Manager  (ECM)  upheld  the
    refusal.


 7. The appeal came before Judge Simpson on the 5th August 2016. She  heard
    oral evidence from the Sponsors Mr and Mrs Nezam and had regard to  the
    documentary evidence that was presented  in  respect  of  Mrs  Shahnaz.
    Judge Simpson found the Sponsors to be credible witnesses. Indeed there
    is  no  indication  on  the  face  of  the  determination  that   their
    credibility was challenged by the HOPO on the  day.  Having  considered
    all of that evidence Judge Simpson found as follows:


              i) Mrs Shahnaz meets all of the requirements to be given leave
                 to enter as a visitor. In particular it was found that  she
                 is a genuine visitor who intends to leave the UK at the end
                 of her trip. The facts underpinning that finding  are:  Mrs
                 Shahnaz enjoys a regular income, has close  family  members
                 in Iran, that she has travelled out of Iran  several  times
                 in recent years, including to the UK, and when she has done
                 so has complied with the terms of her visa.


             ii) The ability of Mrs Shahnaz to finance the trip was  not  in
                 issue since it was Mr Nezam who would pay  for  the  entire
                 thing; he was well able to do so.


            iii) Mrs Shahnaz is particularly close to her  daughter  Pooneh.
                 They were "inseparable" prior to Pooneh's marriage and they
                 continue to have daily contact. Pooneh has  looked  to  her
                 mother for especial emotional support  during  a  difficult
                 time in her life. She had suffered a  miscarriage  in  2013
                 and at the time of the application for entry clearance  was
                 heavily pregnant. By the time that the appeal  came  before
                 Judge Simpson that pregnancy  had  ended  tragically,  with
                 Pooneh's second child  being  still-born  at  term.   These
                 facts were, in accordance with the guidance in  Kugathas  v
                 ECO [2003] EWCA Civ 31, capable of engaging Article 8.


             iv) In all of the exceptional compelling circumstances of  this
                 case the decision was disproportionate and the  appeal  was
                 allowed.




    The ECO's Challenge


 8. There are two grounds of appeal:


              i) Following amendments made by the Immigration Act 2014 there
                 are now only three decisions that may attract  a  right  of
                 appeal under s82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
                 Act 2002. One of these is a decision  to  'refuse  a  human
                 rights claim'. There can  only  have  been  a  decision  to
                 'refuse a human rights claim' where a  human  rights  claim
                 has been made. It is submitted that no human  rights  claim
                 was made in the application for entry clearance,  and  that
                 there has been  no  decision  to  refuse  on  human  rights
                 grounds. There was therefore no jurisdiction for the First-
                 tier Tribunal to hear the appeal  and  the  decision  is  a
                 nullity.


             ii) In any event the decision is wrong. Family life  exists  at
                 present via video chat and telephone, and the decision does
                 not interfere  with  that.  The  Judge  does  not  consider
                 whether it would be possible for the two women to have  met
                 in a third country.




    Discussion and Findings


 9. There is no merit in ground (i). As Mr Harrison agrees, the drafter  of
    the  grounds  appears  to  have  overlooked  the  assertions   in   the
    application form in respect of human rights:


         "also please take into consideration that my  daughter  had  a  bad
         experience as I explained before, I therefore request  you  on  the
         basis of human rights allow me to be by the side  of  my  daughter"
         [at Q67]


    And the decision of the ECM:


         "I have considered the appellant's rights under Article 8  of  ECHR
         however  I  am  not  satisfied  there   are   any   compelling   or
         compassionate circumstances".


10. It is now accepted before me that Mrs Shahnaz did make a  human  rights
    claim in the  course  of  her  application  for  entry  clearance,  and
    although that was ignored by the ECO, it was dealt  with  by  the  ECM.
    There was therefore a decision to refuse on human rights  grounds,  and
    it is against that that the appeal to Judge Simpson lay. Ground (i)  is
    therefore dismissed.


11. Ground (ii) takes issue with the substantive findings. Mr Nezam  argues
    that the points made in  this  section  of  the  grounds  amount  to  a
    disagreement with the findings of the Judge, and that the ECO has  here
    failed to identify any error of  law.    At  paragraph  9  the  grounds
    state:


         "in any event it is the ECO's view that the refusal does not amount
         to a  disproportionate  interference  with  the  Appellant's  human
         rights"


    It does not need to be said, but the ECO's "view" was not determinative
    of this matter: Judge Simpson is entitled, by the statutory scheme,  to
    take her own "view".  Mr Nezam is correct to characterise  this  as  an
    argument with the outcome, rather than a point of law.


12. See further at paragraph 10 of the grounds:


         "the Judge errs in finding there  to  be  compelling  circumstances
         such as to justify the granting of entry clearance".


    The grounds do not explain what the error might be.   Before me  Pooneh
    Nezam pointed out that the entire basis of the application had been the
    difficult circumstances that she found herself  in.   She  had  already
    lost a child and at the time of the application was  extremely  worried
    about losing a second. This had been made clear  on  the  face  of  the
    application.  That is why she wanted her mother to be with her. By  the
    time that the appeal had come before Judge Simpson Mr and Mrs Nezam had
    lost a second child - and Mrs Shahnaz a second grandchild.   I need not
    elaborate on why the appellant and sponsors might have  advanced  those
    circumstances  to  be  "compelling":   Judge  Simpson  was   rationally
    entitled to find that they were and Mr Harrison accepted that to be the
    case when he declined to pursue that ground.


13.  The  grounds  raise  two  specific  points  that  do   merit   further
    consideration. First, the ECO emphasises that family life is  currently
    maintained by 'VoIP' and can continue to be so. Secondly, the  Tribunal
    has failed to consider whether Mrs Shahnaz and Pooneh Nezam could  meet
    in a third country.


14. The latter point can be dealt with briefly. It is not a matter that was
    raised in the refusal. Nor, as far as I can see from the  determination
    and the record of proceedings, was it a submission made by the HOPO  on
    the day.   It is therefore hardly surprising that Judge Simpson did not
    deal with it.   If that was an omission amounting to an error of law it
    is one that is immaterial.  At the date of both the ECO's decision  and
    the appeal before Judge Simpson, Pooneh Nezam was in an advanced  state
    of pregnancy and relied on medical advice to the effect that these were
    "high risk" pregnancies and that she should not  therefore  travel.  If
    the two women were to see each other in person, at those points in time
    at least it would have to be in this country.


15. As to the matter of whether there was an interference with family  life
    as it is presently  constituted,  I  have  had  regard  to  the  recent
    decisions of ECO (Sierra Leone)  v  Kopoi  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1511  and
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v Onuorah  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
    1757, both appeals in which  the  Court  of  Appeal  considered  'human
    rights appeals' involving applications for visit visas[1].  Two  points
    arise that may be relevant to the ECO's instant appeal.


16. The first is the restatement of the  Kugathas  principles.   The  Court
    underlined that in  cases  of  adult  relatives  (other  than  spouses)
    decision-makers must look to  the  substance  of  the  family  life  in
    question to determine whether there  exist  ties  over  and  above  the
    normal bonds of affection that  would  normally  subsist  between,  for
    instance, siblings.  Some form of dependency would normally be required
    to for Article 8 to be engaged.  In Onuorah  the  relationship  between
    appellant and sponsor was sibling; in Kopoi the parties  were  cousins.
    In  both  cases  the  Tribunal  had  accepted  there  to  be  ties   of
    significance and affection, but not the extent  that  Article  8  could
    rationally be said to be engaged.  The second  point  raised  in  these
    cases is whether there can be said to be a 'lack of respect' for family
    life where by definition, the visit is likely to be  relatively  short.
    That is, on my reading, another way of putting the  argument  expressed
    in the grounds, that a short visit is demonstrably  not  necessary  for
    these two women to conduct the relationship that they currently enjoy.


17. I have given consideration to whether, had the  guidance  in  Kopoi  or
    Onuorah been available to Judge Simpson, her decision would  have  been
    any different.


18. In respect of the Kugathas question I am satisfied that  Judge  Simpson
    understood the test to be applied: she sets it out herself at paragraph
    18 of her decision.  She sets out in some  detail  the  nature  of  the
    relationship in the  past,  accepting  the  evidence  that  mother  and
    daughter were exceptionally close and that prior to  Pooneh's  marriage
    they were "inseparable". She considers the evidence that  since  Pooneh
    married and moved to the UK the very close nature of that  relationship
    has continued, with the two women speaking on a daily  basis.    Pooneh
    had described to Judge Simpson that "the  emotional  support  that  she
    receives from her mother is different to that that  she  receives  from
    her husband" [at ï¿½10]. She has  not  made  any  meaningful  friendships
    since her arrival in the UK.    Importantly  Judge  Simpson  emphasises
    that this is a relationship that must be assessed  in  the  context  of
    Pooneh going through what she, not unreasonably, described in court  as
    being "the worst time of my life". At the date of the  application  she
    had already lost one child; by the date of the appeal she  had  lost  a
    second.   She was frightened and grief stricken and wanted  her  mother
    to be with her.  There was a  strong  emotional  dependency  such  that
    Article 8 was engaged.


19. These (unchallenged) facts bring me to the matter of interference.  The
    ECO is correct to point out that this is a 'family life' that has  thus
    far been enjoyed, since 2012 at least, by  video  chat  and  telephone.
    That it could continue in that way was not in issue. The point that was
    here being made however, was that there were particular  circumstances,
    arising from this family's multiple bereavements,  that  meant  that  a
    personal meeting became hugely important. Both mother  and  grandmother
    had suffered that loss.   Whilst Pooneh Nezam has attended court to  be
    able to explain her anguish in person, and how essential it was to  her
    to have her mother here, it was evident from the facts (and indeed  the
    way that she expressed herself in her  application)  that  Mrs  Shahnaz
    desperately wanted to be here to be able to  console  her  daughter  in
    person.


20. At paragraph 30 of Kopoi Lord Justice Sales said the following:
         "In my view, the shortness of the proposed  visit  in  the  present
         case is a yet further indication that the refusal of leave to enter
         did not involve any want of respect for anyone's  family  life  for
         the purposes of Article 8. A three week visit would not  involve  a
         significant contribution to 'family life' in  the  sense  in  which
         that term is used in Article 8. Of course, it would often  be  nice
         for family members to meet up and visit in this way.  But  a  short
         visit of this kind will not establish a relationship between any of
         the individuals concerned of support going beyond normal  emotional
         ties, even if there were a  positive  obligation  under  Article  8
         (which there is not) to allow a person to enter the UK  to  try  to
         develop a 'family life' which does not currently exist."
21. To my mind this passage illustrates how far removed this case  is  from
    the facts in Kopoi. This was a case  where  the  short  proposed  visit
    would make a very significant contribution  to  'family  life'  in  the
    sense that in which the term is used in Article 8.    Mrs  Shahnaz  did
    not seek entry clearance because it would be  "nice"  to  meet  up  and
    visit her daughter  and  son-in-law  in  this  way.  She  sought  entry
    clearance to visit because of the  particular  circumstances  that  had
    arisen: her daughter was emotionally dependent upon her and  they  were
    unable to see each other anywhere other than the UK.


22. Having considered all of the above I am  satisfied  that  the  ECO  has
    failed to identify any arguable error of law in the decision  of  Judge
    Simpson.


    In the Alternative


23. I would ask the ECM to note that none of the positive findings of  fact
    in Judge Simpson's decision have  been  challenged.    I  have  had  an
    opportunity to hear directly from Mr and Mrs Nezam and I entirely agree
    with the finding that on the balance of probabilities Mrs Shahnaz is  a
    genuine visitor who intends to leave the UK at the end of her trip. The
    sole reason for refusal was that there was some additional money in her
    bank account that did not appear to be accounted  for  by  her  pension
    payments. Those transactions were satisfactorily explained  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal with reference to documentary evidence of bonds and
    bonuses in the pension schemes. The trip was to be paid for by Mr Nezam
    who had produced bank  statements  showing  in  excess  of  ï¿½75,000  in
    available funds. Mrs Shahnaz had amply  demonstrated  an  incentive  to
    leave the UK at the end of her visit: she has lived in her own home for
    three decades; she has a close relationship with her five  sisters  who
    all live close by; her son and daughter-in-law remain living  in  Iran;
    she is financially independent and absent fundamental  changes  to  the
    law in Iran, will be until she dies, in receipt of two  pensions.   Any
    future applications for entry clearance as a  visitor  by  Mrs  Shahnaz
    should therefore be assessed in light of these findings.




    Decisions and Directions


24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law and it
    is upheld.


25. There is no order for anonymity.

grounds were drafted and so I considered whether they would have a bearing
on the ECO's appeal.
