Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr T Lawrence, Southwark Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr S Ouseley, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW


1.   The appellants are citizens of Jamaica.  They are a mother born  on  20
    December 1970, a son born 15 January 1991 and a daughter born on 24 May
    1997.  The appellants  sought  confirmation  of  their  entitlement  to
    remain in the United Kingdom based on the 2006  EEA  Regulations.   The
    respondent refused their applications on 9 January 2012.  Their appeals
    against the respondent's decision were dismissed by First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Buckwell under the 2006 EEA Regulations  and  Article  8  of  the
    ECHR.

2.   The appellants were granted permission to appeal the  judge's  decision
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Warr on 1 August 2012 for the  reasons  set  in
    paragraph 1 of Mr Lawrence's document entitled  "Submissions  for  24th
    May 2013 For Mention Hearing".  Paragraphs 2 and  3  of  Mr  Lawrence's
    submissions set  out  the  error  of  law  that  was  conceded  by  the
    respondent and my decision to remit the matter for  re-hearing  by  the
    First Tier Tribunal following the decision by  the  European  Court  of
    Justice in response to the reference made  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Alarape and Tijani Case C-529/11.  That decision has now been delivered
    and the decision has been summarised by Mr Lawrence in paragraph  4  of
    his submissions.

3.   Mr Ouseley accepted that the two issues identified in  paragraph  5  of
    Mr Lawrence's submissions are the issues that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    needs  to  re-determine.   They  are  whether  each,  if  any,  of  the
    appellants enjoys a right of  residence  in  European  Union  law  from
    Article 14 of Regulation EU (No.492/2011) and secondly Article 8 of the
    ECHR.  The further issue which needs to be determined  is  whether  the
    first appellant's marriage to Mr. Christian Tchamande, an EEA  national
    was genuine.

4.   In accordance with Practice Direction 7.2(b) I remit  this  matter  for
    re-hearing by a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than Judge Buckwell.
