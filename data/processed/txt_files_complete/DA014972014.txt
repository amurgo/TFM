For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Dearden
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 15th January 2015.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Burundi  born  on  8th  April  1985.   He
    entered the UK on 9th March 2003 and shortly thereafter claimed asylum.
     The application was refused and his subsequent appeal  was  dismissed.
    He became appeal rights exhausted on 27th May 2005.

 3. On 18th October 2007 he pleaded guilty at Kingston Crown Court to being
    knowingly involved in the supply of a controlled drug and was sentenced
    to fifteen months' imprisonment.  He was served with a decision to make
    a deportation order against him and his appeal was dismissed.  He again
    became appeal rights exhausted on 1st August  2008.   He  made  further
    submissions but, on 4th December 2009 the deportation order was signed.

 4. On 23rd March 2010 an application was made to  revoke  the  deportation
    order.  Further  representations  were  made  on  10th  December  2010.
    Eventually, on 4th July 2014 the Secretary of State refused  to  revoke
    the existing order and it was the appeal against  that  decision  which
    was before Judge Dearden.

 5. Judge Dearden set out in detail the evidence, the representations,  his
    findings and his conclusions and dismissed the appeal.

 6. He recorded that the appellant's representative asked  him  to  adjourn
    the appeal in order to allow the social  worker  who  had  provided  an
    independent report to the Tribunal to give oral  evidence.   The  Judge
    refused the application, observing that the social worker's report  had
    not actually been served until the day before the hearing was fixed and
    there had been plenty of time for her  to  have  been  called  to  give
    evidence if the solicitor had thought it sensible to do so.   The  fact
    that Counsel might have taken a different view to those who  instructed
    him was not a good reason to adjourn, because if the  papers  had  been
    prepared in adequate time  a  conference  could  have  taken  place  to
    discuss decisions of this type.

The Grounds of Application

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the Judge
    had erred in law in refusing the adjournment  application,  failing  to
    understand  that  the  oral  evidence  was  highly  material  since  it
    illuminated the negative impact upon the children.  The children  ought
    to have been given the chance to put their case to the Tribunal at  its
    absolute highest (ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC  4).   They  were  in  this
    position through no fault of their own and ought to have been  afforded
    more latitude. The judge had said that he was unable to understand what
    the social worker meant by significant and long term  impact  upon  the
    children's mental health and yet had  not  allowed  an  adjournment  to
    enable her to provide live evidence.

 8. Second, the assessment under Section 55 was inadequate since the  Judge
    had made no personal assessment of the children.  The Judge referred to
    "many other children in the UK who are without both  parents"  but  did
    not focus his attention on the personal assessment of these children as
    he was required to do.

 9. It was also argued in the grounds that the respondent had not made  any
    sustainable  Section  55  assessment  in  the   decision   letter   and
    accordingly the decision was not in accordance with  the  law,  but  Mr
    Hussain did not pursue this ground in his submissions.

10. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Landes for  the  reasons  set
    out in the decision.

11. On 25th February 2015 the  respondent  served  a  reply  defending  the
    determination and in particular the decision of the  Judge  to  proceed
    with the appeal and refused the adjournment request.

Consideration of Whether there is a Material Error of Law

12. In Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 418 the President held:

         "If the Tribunal refuses to accede to an adjournment  request  such
         decision  could  in  principle  be  erroneous  in  law  in  several
         respects: these include a failure to take into account all material
         considerations; permitting immaterial  considerations  to  intrude;
         denying the party concerned of a fair hearing; failing to apply the
         correct test and acting irrationally.  In practice  in  most  cases
         the question will be whether  the  refusal  deprived  the  effected
         party of his to a fair hearing.  Where an  adjournment  refusal  is
         challenged on fairness grounds it is important  to  recognise  that
         the question for the Upper Tribunal is not whether  the  FtT  acted
         reasonably.  Rather the test to be applied is that of fairness: was
         there any depravation of the  affected  party's  right  to  a  fair
         hearing?" See SH (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 1284.

13. I have some sympathy with the Judge's reasoning when he considered  the
    adjournment request, since as he pointed out, the appeal had  been  the
    subject of a Case Management Review hearing and had been adjourned on a
    previous occasion. However, the problem is that,  when   analysing  the
    social worker's report he said  that he did  not  understand  what  she
    meant by some of the terms which she used and did not have an answer to
    the question of how long it would take for the children to get over the
    upset of the appellant's departure and whether they would in due course
    recover assisted by electronic communication.   I  was  told  that  the
    representative had asked for the appeal to  go  part-heard  and  to  be
    reconvened in order to allow the social worker to give  evidence  which
    could have been a way out of the difficulties.  As  it  is  the  Judge,
    having said that, in effect, he did not need the  expert  to  tell  him
    what he already knew, then raised questions to which he  did  not  have
    the answer.

14. There is a further difficulty. It is quite clear from the  decision  in
    MAB (paragraph 399 unduly harsh USA [2015] UKUT 00435 that the focus of
    the determination should be upon an evaluation of the consequences  and
    the impact upon the individual concerned.  It is clear from the Judge's
    reasoning that he did not make a personal assessment of the  effect  on
    these particular children when he observed that they would  not  be  in
    any worse condition than many other children in the UK or indeed, as he
    said, much different from some of the children in their schools.   That
    is the wrong approach.

15. Finally the Judge recorded that within the appellant's bundle there was
    a report prepared by the independent  social  worker  Christine  Brown.
    The Judge said that there had been a decision of the Vice-President  of
    the Upper Tribunal in which he had made  some  uncomplimentary  remarks
    about Ms Brown's independence and bearing that in mind and the  age  of
    the report (which was dated 16th April 2010) he decided to place little
    weight upon its contents. Whilst the Judge was quite  entitled  to  say
    that, since the report was prepared some four years ago he would  place
    little weight upon it, in fact he made no reference to it  at  all  and
    therefore  in   effect   discounted   potentially   relevant   evidence
    altogether.

16.  Accordingly,  cumulatively,  there  are  errors   of   law   in   this
    determination, such that it should be set aside.

The Resumed Hearing

17. I heard oral evidence from the appellant  Abu  Adam  Ali,  his  partner
    Natasha Dukes and from the independent social worker Diana Rodgers.

18. There are no credibility issues in this appeal.  Broadly  speaking  the
    evidence was entirely consistent and Mrs  Pettersen  properly  did  not
    seek to submit that any of the witnesses had been untruthful.

19. Mr Ali confirmed that the contents of his two statements were true  and
    correct.

20. He came to the UK when he was 17 years old, 11 years ago.  He has  been
    in a relationship with his partner for all of that time and  they  have
    lived together for the last 10 years.  They have 3 children, the eldest
    10, the second 9 and the last 1.  They are all British  citizens.   His
    partner has lived in the UK all her life and British by birth.

21. The appellant is the primary carer of  the  children  whilst  his  wife
    works full-time. His wife works as a care assistant.  At  the  time  of
    the last hearing she was on maternity leave and when she went  back  to
    work it was to a different care home.  She  works  full-time,  but  the
    hours vary and are not in any regular pattern.  She normally does a  38
    hour week. Ms Dukes suffered from depression during the course of  last
    year and was on antidepressants from May to October 2014.

22. The children are all doing well in school and are happily settled here.



23. Ms Dukes has her mother and three sisters all relatively nearby and the
    children stay with their grandparents about once  a  month.   They  see
    their cousins on a regular basis.

24. Diana Rogers confirmed that  the  contents  of  her  two  reports  were
    accurate and she stood by them.   In  her  report  she  said  that  the
    appellant and his partner present as a warm loving couple  who  have  a
    close and mutually supportive relationship.  That was entirely apparent
    from the oral evidence given by them both.  She said that  she  had  no
    reason to believe that they would not  remain  a  strong  and  balanced
    couple who would  do  everything  that  they  could  to  provide  their
    children with the right environment.  All three children  presented  as
    clean  and  well  looked  after.   There  were  no  concerns  with  the
    children's  attendance,  academic  attainment  or  presentation.    She
    recorded that the headmistress described the  family  as  "lovely"  and
    where very involved in school life.   She  herself  observed  that  the
    children were relaxed, happy, polite and articulate who enjoyed a  warm
    and comfortable relationship with their parents.

25. In her oral evidence she said that the children would be devastated  if
    the appellant were deported.  The family have decided not to share  the
    anxieties about the potential deportation with the children, a decision
    which she supported.

26. Ms Rogers said that the loss of their father would be a bereavement  to
    the children.  In the  short  term  they  would  experience  confusion,
    despair and anger.  He has been at their home 24 hours  a  day.   There
    would be a huge emotional impact particularly upon the  older  children
    who were approaching adolescence and would struggle to  understand  the
    loss of their father.

27. Ms Rogers acknowledged that children were resilient and many  do  adapt
    and survive.  However children were not always fine and the  impact  on
    these children was frankly unknowable.  In her professional opinion  it
    could lead to significant problems particularly  for  the  older  girl.
    Girls often turn in on themselves in such situations which  could  lead
    to self-harm, depression and poor life choices.   Whilst  other  family
    members would no doubt rally round they could not replace their father.
    He was the dominant factor in their lives in  providing  a  secure  and
    loving home.

28. Mrs Pettersen asked Ms Rogers whether the loss could  be  mitigated  by
    the use of Skype and Facebook.  Ms Rogers said that that  was  not  how
    children communicate.  They talk when they choose and not at particular
    times.  It could even add to their distress.  When  asked  whether  age
    appropriate explanations could be given to them she said that,  so  far
    as the children were  concerned,  the  decision  would  appear  grossly
    unfair.  Their father had done something wrong and  had  been  punished
    and  had  since  become  a  model  citizen.   The  children  would  not
    cognitively understand the decision, because of their age, and for  the
    older two  children  there  would  be  an  emotional  reaction  to  the
    deportation of their father which would impact on their development and
    they would suffer significant harm.

29. There would also be an impact on his partner.  She  would  struggle  to
    cope with her own feelings and  be  less  able  to  support  them.   At
    present the children were living in an environment which was safe, they
    were loved and valued  and  boundaries  were  set.   The  parents  were
    providing everything necessary to bring the children to adulthood.   If
    that was taken away there would be a  real  impact  on  the  children's
    ability to develop into full members of society. The appellant  was  an
    integral part of his children's developing identity.   They  are  mixed
    race, in a white area, and the rest of their extended family are  white
    British.

30. In her addendum to her report she concluded:

         "I am aware that many children are brought up without their fathers
         but would also add that the majority of families with whom  I  have
         worked have been single parent families.  I  also  understand  that
         the maintenance of effective immigration control is in  the  public
         interest.  However in my opinion breaking up what is  a  happy  and
         secure family has the potential for significant harm  to  Mr  Ali's
         three children and such harm would also impact on the wider society
         in which they live."

31. Ms Rogers is a State registered nurse and children and families  social
    worker with mental health training and has worked for over 20 years  in
    the field.

32. Also in the bundle is a report from another independent social  worker,
    Christine Brown who has been qualified since 1986 and employed  by  the
    authorities in Trafford, Thameside and Manchester.  The report confirms
    the excellent parenting which the appellant and his partner provide  to
    the children and also concludes that Mr Ali's deportation would  result
    in them responding with anger confusion and deep distress.

The Respondent's Case

33. The  respondent  accepts  that  the  appellant  is  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with his children, who  are  British  citizens,
    and with his partner Ms Dukes.

34. Judge Dearden recorded that it was the Secretary  of  State's  position
    that it was the appellant who should go to Burundi leaving his wife and
    children behind.  Mrs Pettersen confirmed that it was not her case that
    the family should accompany the appellant to  Burundi.   The  issue  in
    this case is the effect on the children if they were left behind here.

35. So far as  the  partner  was  concerned,  the  effect  on  her  of  the
    deportation would not be unduly harsh.  There was  some  evidence  that
    she had been depressed but she only took medication for six months  and
    if there were further difficulties she could  seek  medical  attention.
    She had her sisters and mother who lived in the same area with whom she
    had good relationships and there were support networks available to her
    not only from the immediate family but also from the State.

36. She observed that deportation would not involve loss of all contact and
    whilst she would agree that no contact at all would be devastating  for
    the children, the ability to Skype would ameliorate the situation.  The
    family  had  known  since  2008  that  the  appellant  was  liable   to
    deportation.   The  appellant  would  not  vanish  overnight  and   the
    situation could be managed.

37. In her submission the effect on the children as described by Ms  Rogers
    was speculative but she left in my hands the decision as to whether the
    effect on them would be unduly harsh.

38. Mr Hussain drew my attention to the sentencing remarks  of  the  Judge.
    Although the appellant had been involved in a serious offence he was at
    the lower end of  the  offending.   There  was  only  one  incident  in
    relation to one offence and there was no other  evidence  against  him.
    He received a sentence of fifteen months for the supply of  a  wrap  of
    cocaine worth �20. This was a one-off event in October 2007. There  had
    been no reoffending.  He relied on the evidence from the social  worker
    who had observed the family at first hand.

Findings and Conclusions

39. The relevant requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  are  set  out  in
    paragraphs 398 and 399.

40. The appellant falls within paragraph 398B since he has  been  sentenced
    to a period of imprisonment of fifteen months.

41. Paragraph 398B states that the deportation of the person from the UK is
    conducive to the public good and in the public  interest  because  they
    have been convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced to
    a period of imprisonment of less than four years but  at  least  twelve
    months.

42. The Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider  whether
    paragraph 399 or 399A applies and if it does not the public interest in
    deportation will only be outweighed by other factors  where  there  are
    very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described  in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A.

43. The relevant sections of paragraph 399 are where:

      a) The person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with
         a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK; and

          i) the child is a British citizen; or

         ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for  at  least  the
             seven years immediately preceding the date of the  immigration
             decision; and in either case

               a) it would be unduly harsh for the  child  to  live  in  the
                  country to which the person is to be deported;

               b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK
                  without the person who is to be deported; or

      b) the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner
         who is in the UK and is a British citizen or settled in the UK; and

          i) the  relationship  was  formed  at  a  time  when  the  person
             (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration status
             was not precarious; and

         ii) it would be unduly harsh for  that  partner  to  live  in  the
             country to which the person  is  to  be  deported  because  of
             compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
             paragraph EX.2 of Appendix FM; and

        iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain in the  UK
             without the person who is to be deported.

44. The statutory framework for the Rules is set out in Section 117 of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Under  Section  117C(v),
    Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
    with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of C's deportation
    on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

45. Mr Hussain did not put his case on the basis of the  relationship  with
    Ms Dukes.  That is quite right since the relationship was  formed  when
    the appellant was a failed  asylum  seeker.   His  appeal  against  the
    refusal was dismissed in November 2003 and he began  to  live  with  Ms
    Dukes in 2004.  Moreover the couple have known since June 2008 that his
    appeal against deportation had been dismissed.  Whereas there  is  some
    evidence that Ms Dukes' mental health suffered during 2014  she  is  no
    longer on any medication and does have  significant  support  from  her
    immediate family.

46. The real issue in this appeal is whether it would be unduly  harsh  for
    the children to remain in the UK without their father.

47. There has been a divergence of view in the Upper  Tribunal  as  to  how
    this question should be approached.  Both  MAB  (paragraph  399  unduly
    harsh) USA [2015] UKUT 00435 and KMO (Section 117 unduly harsh) Nigeria
    [2015] UKUT 00543 were promulgated after the Judge's decision and there
    is therefore no criticism of  him  that  he  did  not  take  them  into
    account.  Nevertheless they set out  the  approach  to  be  applied  in
    deportation cases.

48. In MAB it was held that the phrase  unduly  harsh  does  not  import  a
    balancing exercise requiring the public interest to be weighed  against
    the circumstances of the individual whether child  or  partner  of  the
    deportee.  Focus is solely upon an evaluation of the  consequences  and
    impact upon the individual concerned.

49. By contrast in KMO the Upper Tribunal held that where an assessment  is
    required to be made as to whether a person meets  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules, as that comprises an assessment
    of that person's claim under Article 8 of the ECHR it is  necessary  to
    have regard in making that assessment  to  the  matters  to  which  the
    Tribunal must have regard as a consequence of the provisions of Section
    117C.  In particular those include that, the more serious  the  offence
    committed, the greater is the public interest  in  deportation  of  the
    foreign criminal.  Therefore the word unduly in the phrase unduly harsh
    requires consideration of whether, in the light of the  seriousness  of
    the offence committed by the foreign criminal and the  public  interest
    considerations that come into play, the impact on the  child,  children
    or partner of the foreign criminal being deported  is  inordinately  or
    excessively harsh.

50. There was no disagreement in KMO with the definition of unduly harsh as
    set out in MAB which is as follows:

         "Whether the consequences of deportation will be unduly  harsh  for
         the individual  involves  more  than  uncomfortable,  inconvenient,
         undesirable,  unwelcome  or  merely   difficult   and   challenging
         consequences and imposes a considerably  more  elevated  or  higher
         threshold.  The consequences for an individual  will  be  harsh  if
         they are severe or bleak and they will be unduly  so  if  they  are
         inordinately or excessively harsh taking into account  all  of  the
         circumstances of the individual."

51. In this case I am not  required  to  decide  which  of  the  two  Upper
    Tribunal cases should be followed since in both  scenarios  the  answer
    will be the same.

52. So far as the offence itself is concerned, the supply of  a  controlled
    drug is inevitably a serious offence.   Those  who  consume  controlled
    drugs often commit offences which lead to further adverse  consequences
    for society generally.  I do not for one minute seek  to  minimise  its
    seriousness.

53. On the other hand, it is clear from the Judge's sentencing remarks that
    the appellant pleaded guilty, that he was  at  the  lower  end  of  the
    offending, that there was no other evidence against him  save  for  the
    one offence, and the others who were more heavily involved received far
    longer sentences.  The appellant acknowledges in his statement that  he
    was young and stupid and fell into the  wrong  crowd.   The  amount  of
    drugs he supplied was clearly very modest, being one  wrap  of  cocaine
    worth �20.  He has no other criminal record  and  for  the  last  eight
    years has contributed to his local community through voluntary work for
    the whole Afro-Caribbean Association working with youths  aged  between
    14 and 19.

54. By contrast  the  appellant  in  KMO  had  been  at  the  centre  of  a
    considerable fraudulent activity.  188 accounts had been manipulated or
    used to produce some �98,000 worth of transactions either completed  or
    attempted.  The conspiracy was a professionally planned operation  over
    a significant period with multiple frauds.  The appellant  in  MAB  was
    sentenced to three years' imprisonment on a number of counts for sexual
    offences involving children under the age  of  13.   There  is  clearly
    therefore a significant distinction to be made between the offences  in
    those cases and in this. Moreover, in that case the children  were  20,
    17 and 13 years old respectively.  There was  no  evidence  that  there
    would be any immigration difficulty in their visiting their  father  in
    the USA and the evidence did not establish that visits to America would
    be prohibitively expensive in the foreseeable future.  The relationship
    with the wife had broken down and the  family  were  no  longer  living
    together as a unit.

55. Furthermore in KMO the preserved findings from the first  hearing  were
    that it would not be unduly harsh to require the elder children to live
    in Nigeria; there was no evidence to suggest that it  would  be  unduly
    harsh for the younger two  children  to  live  in  Nigeria  with  their
    parents. Again that is a significant distinction from this  case  where
    the respondent is not arguing that the  children  could  accompany  the
    appellant to Burundi.

56. The defining factor in this case is that the  appellant  is  the  prime
    carer of the children.

57. There is no basis upon which to reject the evidence from Ms Rogers  who
    has observed the family at first hand and who has  over  twenty  years'
    experience as a local authority, social worker and manager all  in  the
    field of children and families.  She managed a team dealing with  child
    protection issues, completing assessments of parents where  the  issues
    of concern included  neglect,  substance  and  alcohol  misuse,  mental
    health problems, domestic violence, learning difficulties and or  where
    previous children have been removed from their parents' care.

58. I was impressed by her as a witness. She did not  seek  to  exaggerate.
    When asked about the detriment to the children, an open  question,  she
    instantly acknowledged the resilience of children and their ability  to
    adapt and survive.  She  said  that  her  principal  concern  was  that
    children were not always fine and that the long term  effect  on  these
    children would be unknown.  There can be no quarrel with  her  evidence
    that they would not be fine in the short term.  Neither  can  there  be
    any concern that in the longer term the effect, particularly  upon  the
    older girl, could be a  serious  impact  on  her  self-esteem  and  her
    ability to cope with the loss of their primary carer who is  absolutely
    dominant to their lives.  At present  these  children  are  set  to  be
    functioning members of society, in her view, living in a secure, loving
    home with parents who set a good example  to  them.   Her  evidence  is
    entirely supported by the head teacher.

59. There can be no issue with her conclusion that if that was  taken  away
    there would be a considerable impact on their ability to  develop  into
    full members of society.

60.  Although  Mrs  Pettersen  sought  to  argue  that  her  evidence   was
    speculative, it is the evidence of an experienced  professional  and  I
    find no proper basis for not relying on it. She did not seek  to  argue
    that, if Ms Rogers' conclusions were reliable that the  effect  on  the
    children did not amount to being unduly harsh.

61. She did submit that the loss could be ameliorated via Skype.  That  may
    well be so for children who have less contact with their father, or who
    perhaps are older.  However to suggest  that  Skype  calls  to  Burundi
    could properly compensate in any way for  the  loss  of  their  primary
    carer is simply unrealistic.

62. In R (on the application of Mansoor) v SSHD  [2011]  EWHC  832  (Admin)
    Blake J at paragraph 16 said:

         "Third, the reference  to  continued  contact  and  can  visit  and
         communicate and maintain family  ties  seems  to  again  have  been
         generic assessments as between husband and wife, husband and  minor
         children, claimant wife and minor children as well as  the  parents
         and their older children who were now over the age of 18 using  the
         ages given at the outset of this judgment.  If members of a  family
         enjoy family life in an interdependent household  of  partners  and
         minor and dependent children it is no comfort to say that they  can
         continue to enjoy that  family  life  by  telephoning  each  other,
         emailing, video conferencing  or  any  other  forms  of  electronic
         technology that may be in existence.  Lord Bingham  was  indicating
         this in the landmark case  of  Huang  v  SSHD  [2007]  UKHL  11  at
         paragraph 20 but more recently and I appreciate  not  available  to
         the IJ at the time the Upper Tribunal has made  the  point  in  the
         case of EM (Zimbabwe) [2010] UKUT 98 (IAC).  If the IJ thought that
         there will be no interference with the family life enjoyed  between
         husband and wife and parents  and  minor  children  if  they  could
         communicate from abroad he was again mistaken."

63. I have no hesitation  in  concluding  that  the  consequences  for  the
    children would be inordinately  severe  and  accordingly  unduly  harsh
    (MAB). The reality of deportation would be the extinguishment of family
    life as it has been known and indeed possibly at all.  The  ability  of
    the  appellant  to  communicate  effectively  from  Burundi  is   quite
    unknowable.  He has no family there who would be able to help him.

64. In the alternative, taking the approach of KMO, and  including  in  the
    assessment of proportionality the appellant's  offending  history,  the
    conclusion will be the same.  Undoubtedly the offence was serious, with
    public interest considerations going beyond the offence itself.  On the
    other hand the amounts involved  were  very  small,  it  was  a  single
    occasion and there has been no reoffending.

Notice of Decision

The original Judge erred in law.   His  decision  is  set  aside.   This  is
remade as follows.  The appellant's appeal is allowed under the  Immigration
Rules.
