Officer

(No anonymity order requested or made.)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 6 June 1977.  He  entered
   the UK on a student visa valid from 20 January 2011 to 6  May  2012.   He
   was arrested on 27 March 2013 as a suspected  immigration  offender.   He
   sought asylum on 3 April 2013.  He claimed to be at  risk  on  return  to
   Pakistan from a person who lent  him  money  to  come  the  UK  to  study
   English.  The loan had  not  been  repaid.   The  lender  threatened  and
   assaulted the appellant's  relatives.   The  police  declined  to  become
   involved due to the lender's political connections.

2) The  respondent  refused  the  claim  by  letter  dated  16  April  2013,
   explaining at paragraphs 47-70 why the account was not found credible; at
   paragraphs 71-75, why  it  was  considered  that  even  if  he  had  been
   threatened by a lender, legal sufficiency of  protection  was  available;
   and at paragraphs 76-84, why it was considered that in any event he could
   relocate.

3) First-tier Tribunal Judge Clough dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  for
   reasons explained in her determination promulgated on 18 September  2013.



4) The appellant sought permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  on
   these grounds:

    2. ... the Immigration Judge has erred in law in  holding  that  on  an
       assessment  of  the   evidence   of   the   appellant's   individual
       circumstances  and  taking  into  account   the   decision   in   AW
       (Sufficiency of Protection) Pakistan (2011) UKUT 31  (IAC)  it  "...
       cannot be said there is an  insufficiency  of  state  protection  in
       Pakistan ..." (paragraph 29, second sentence)  ...  It  is  accepted
       that the client cannot succeed under  the  Refugee  Convention  (for
       reasons stated by the Immigration Judge at  paragraph  27),  but  he
       maintains his appeal in respect of Articles 2 and 3 ECHR.


    3.  Decision in AW: in that case, the Upper Tribunal held that  it  was
       correct to hold that there was  a  sufficiency  of  protection  only
       after proper assessment of an appellant's  individual  circumstances
       (see Headnote 2 and paragraphs 23 and 24 in the case,  referring  to
       paragraph 55  (15)  in  Bagdanavicius).   In  particular  the  Upper
       Tribunal  stated  that  a  fact  finding  judge"   ...   must   look
       notwithstanding a general sufficiency of protection in a country, to
       the individual circumstances of the appellant ..." (paragraph 24).

    4. Error in assessment of the appellant's individual circumstances:  in
       paragraph 29 of her decision the Immigration Judge states  that  the
       appellant's individual circumstances are that he would return  as  a
       failed asylum seeker  "...  owing  money,  half  of   which  he  has
       available to repay his lender (emphasis  added).   She  has  made  a
       mistake: the appellant does not have " ...  half  ...  available  to
       repay ..."  Money he had previously saved to do this was confiscated
       (see paragraph 22, last sentence).  An error of fact can  amount  to
       an error in law if it is sufficiently important.  Having  regard  to
       the importance the Immigration Judge  (rightly  -  according  to  AW
       (supra, and also referred to by the Immigration Judge) placed on the
       appellant's individual circumstances, she has erred in law in making
       an error in fact when assessing these circumstances for the purposes
       of applying the test in AW.

    5. ... it cannot be said that this error in fact is irrelevant since it
       goes to a core/crucial aspect of the Article 2, 3, ECHR claim.

5) First-tier Tribunal Judge Pedro refused permission to appeal by  decision
   dated 3 October 2013.

6) The appellant applied for permission to the Upper Tribunal:

          2. The appellant repeats the Grounds of Appeal before the FTT  ...
             and with reference to the decision of the FTT dated  3  October
             2013 submits:


          3. Although clear from the decision of the Immigration Judge  that
             his claim does not engage  the  Refugee  Convention  (paragraph
             27), his claim was always restricted to a human rights one,  in
             particular Article 3 (see paragraph 3 in the Immigration  Judge
             decision).  It is not  clear  from  the  decision  whether  she
             accepts or rejects as a fact his assertions  that  he  will  if
             returned suffer treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR.

          4. This is why the  focus  on  sufficiency  of  protection  is  so
             important.  At paragraph 3 of the decision of the FTT  dated  3
             October 2013, the judge erred in holding that  the  Immigration
             Judge was entitled to find that the issue the appellant  feared
             amounted to "a civil matter over an unpaid debt  ..."   In  the
             absence of any findings in fact it is unclear whether (1)  that
             is all the fear amounts to or whether (2) he  would  be  harmed
             (as he alleges his parents were - see  paragraphs  13-16).   If
             (1)  it  is  accepted  that  there  would  be  sufficiency   of
             protection but if (2) more is required to  be  stated  for  the
             reasons in AW.

7) Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley granted permission on 22 October 2013.

8) Ms Watson relied upon the grounds and referred to  paragraph  24  of  AW.
   She submitted that  the  appellant's  individual  circumstances  were  in
   evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, in particular  at  paragraphs  6
   and 52 of his witness statement.  In his asylum interview at Q/A  126  he
   mentioned the money in  his  possession  when  detained  for  immigration
   offending (�3,000).  The judge at paragraph 29  took  that  into  account
   regarding his individual circumstances under reference to  AW,  but  that
   erred in fact, because the money had been confiscated by  the  respondent
   and would not be returned.  (The Presenting Officer confirmed  that  such
   would be the case.) That amounted to error of law, because it was crucial
   that there would not be funds to evade (or reduce) the risk  by  repaying
   half the loan.  The judge had not reasoned adequately whether sufficiency
   of protection was available to the appellant, and  that  correlated  with
   the internal relocation issue.  The determination should be set aside and
   the case sent for fresh hearing of the oral evidence  in  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

9) The Presenting Officer dealt firstly with the last point raised  for  the
   appellant.  He said that no rehearing would be needed,  because  even  if
   there were error, the case should be resolved  on  the  evidence  already
   led.  At its  best,  the  case  was  plainly  defeated  by  the  internal
   relocation alternative.  The risk of which the appellant  complained  was
   personal and local, there being no evidence that his lender had political
   clout so as to trace or pursue him throughout the country.

10) The Presenting Officer made his primary submission  that  there  was  no
   error of law such as to require the determination to be set  aside.   The
   judge did go wrong in thinking  that  the  appellant  would  have  �3,000
   returned to him, but whether he had half the money needed  to  repay  his
   lender was  not  relevant  to  whether  there  is  legal  sufficiency  of
   protection in Pakistan.  Such further reasoning as the judge gave on  the
   sufficiency of protection issue was brief but adequate.  This is a  civil
   matter of an unpaid debt.  The alleged political link, if there ever  was
   any, has receded, because the government in Pakistan has changed.  AW was
   a very different case on  its  facts.   Here,  there  are  no  individual
   circumstances such as to suggest that  legal  sufficiency  of  protection
   would not apply.  As to internal relocation, there was no reason why  the
   appellant could not work and support himself in Pakistan and no  evidence
   of any risk likely to effect him away from his home area.

11) I reserved my determination.

12) The determination does not appear to include an  express  resolution  of
   credibility, but to proceed upon the basis that the appellant's claim may
   be taken largely  at  face  value.   It  then  turns  to  sufficiency  of
   protection at paragraph 29.  There is an error of supposing that half the
   money  to  repay  the  debt  would  be  available.   However,  a  general
   sufficiency of protection in Pakistan is supported by AW, by the analysis
   in the respondent's refusal letter, and by the judge's other findings  at
   paragraph 29.   The  judge  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  there  was
   sufficiency of protection for the appellant over a "civil matter over  an
   unpaid debt".  No more needed to be said.

13) I also accept the submission that, in the alternative, this is  a  claim
   defeated by the availability of  internal  relocation.   The  proposition
   that the lender has a relative in the former governing  party  so  as  to
   extend risk throughout such a vast and populous country  as  Pakistan  is
   far-fetched.  There is no evidence of risk to  the  appellant  throughout
   the country, and there would be nothing unreasonable in expecting him  to
   establish himself elsewhere.  (Incidentally, and  without  condoning  any
   violent  efforts  to  extract  payment,  there  appears  to  be   nothing
   unreasonable about expecting him to repay his debt.)

14) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal has not been shown  to  err
   in law in any respect such as to require it to be set aside, and it shall
   stand.
