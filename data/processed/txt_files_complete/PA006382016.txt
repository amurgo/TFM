                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant before the Upper Tribunal is the Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department.  For the sake of convenience, I will refer  to  OE
    as the claimant herein.

 2. The claimant is a national of Nigeria,  born  in  September  1987.   He
    entered the United Kingdom on 19 November 2013 with a  lawfully  issued
    visit visa - leave to enter being conferred until 24  April  2014.   He
    remained in the United Kingdom unlawfully thereafter.

 3. The claimant was arrested in relation to a criminal matter  on  4  July
    2015 and served with a notice of liability to removal as an overstayer.
     On 28 July 2015 he made an asylum claim.  That application was refused
    by the Secretary of State on 11 January 2016.  In  a  lengthy  decision
    letter  of  the  same  date  the  SSHD  also  gave   consideration   to
    humanitarian protection and articles 2, 3 and 8 ECHR grounds.

 4. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and, in a decision  of
    5  August  2016,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lingam   dismissed   the
    claimant's appeal on asylum and  humanitarian  protection  grounds  but
    allowed it, "under the Partner Route under the Rules and Art  8  ground
    outside the Rules".

Grounds of Challenge

 5. The Secretary of State appeals the  aforementioned  decision  with  the
    permission of First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes, granted on 5  September
    2016.  The pleaded grounds of challenge can be summarised thus:

      i) The First-tier Tribunal erred in  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal
         under the partner  route  of  the  Immigration  Rules  because  the
         claimant is not a partner as defined therein - a  matter  that  the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge did not address;

     ii) In any event, the  claimant  is  a  registered  sex  offender  and,
         consequently,  his  conduct   falls   foul   of   the   suitability
         requirements of the Rules, and in particular S-LTR1.6.  The  First-
         tier  Tribunal  erred  in  failing  to  have  any  regard  to  such
         requirement;

    iii) The FtT's  conclusion  that  the  claimant  is  in  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship with SL, and  in  a  parental  relationship
         with EA, is inadequately reasoned and consequently unlawful;

     iv) The FtT erred in its consideration outwith the Rules -  failing  to
         pay regard to the fact that the claimant's immigration  status  was
         at all times precarious;

      v) The FtT erred in  its  consideration  of  section  117B(6)  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 by failing to consider
         all relevant  factors  in  determining  thereunder  whether  it  is
         reasonable for the child (EA) to leave the United Kingdom  (see  MA
         (Pakistan) and Others [2016] EWCA Civ 705);

     vi) The First-tier Tribunal failed to  engage  in  a  consideration  of
         whether the claimant should return to his homeland and  seek  entry
         clearance (R (on the  application  of  Chen)  v  SSHD  [2015]  UKUT
         00189).

Discussion and Decision

Immigration Rules

 6. At the outset of the hearing  Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  properly  withdrew
    reliance on ground (ii) above.  The Secretary of State  considered  the
    issue of suitability in her decision letter and concluded therein  that
    the claimant did not fall foul of any of the requirements of S-LTR (see
    paragraph 68 thereof).  No point to the contrary was taken  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Consequently, it is  plain  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not err in failing to  find  against  the  claimant  on  a
    matter that was specifically conceded in the decision  letter  and  was
    not taken by the Secretary of State before the Tribunal.

 7. Moving on, challenges are made by the SSHD to the First-tier Tribunal's
    conclusion in relation to the "Partner Route" of the Immigration  Rules
    (paragraph E-LTRP of Appendix FM).

 8. First, it is said that the First-tier Tribunal erred in its  conclusion
    that the claimant and SL are in a genuine and subsisting  relationship.
    Without hesitation, I reject this ground.   The  First-tier  Tribunal's
    analysis of the nature of the relationship between the claimant and  SL
    is comprehensive and, in my conclusion, it was  entirely  open  to  the
    Tribunal to conclude as it did.

 9. Nevertheless, the decision  under  the  Immigration  Rules  is  cleared
    flawed by legal error. In order for the claimant to be  the  considered
    as the 'partner' of SL for the purposes of Appendix FM,  he  must  meet
    the requirements of GEN 1.2 thereof. He does not.

10. It is not asserted that he is the spouse, civil partner  or  fiancï¿½  of
    SL.  Consequently, the claimant was required to demonstrate that he  is
    "a person who  has  been  living  together  with  the  applicant  in  a
    relationship akin to marriage or civil partnership  for  at  least  two
    years prior to the date of application...".

11. Although it is clear on the evidence that the  claimant  has  now  been
    living with SL for more than  two  years  in  a  relationship  akin  to
    marriage and, indeed, that was also the case as  of  the  date  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision, the claimant had not been  living  with
    SL for two years as of the date of his application.  The  couple  began
    living together in May 2014. The 'application', which ever of  possible
    alternative dates is chosen as being the  relevant  date,  was  made  a
    significant period of time prior to May 2016.

12. The claimant is not a partner for the  purposes  of  Appendix  FM  and,
    therefore, the First-tier Tribunal erred in allowing his appeal on  the
    basis that he is.

Article 8 ECHR outside of the Rules

13. Ms Brocklesby-Weller accepted that the error identified above does  not
    infiltrate the First-tier Tribunal's decision on Article 8 ECHR outside
    of the Rules, such decision being made on a truly alternative basis.

14. Nevertheless, a key feature of the decision made  in  relation  to  the
    claimant's Article 8 rights outside of the Rules was a consideration of
    the application of section 117B(6) of  the  2002  Act  -  the  claimant
    having a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying
    (British citizen) child (EA).

15. At paragraph 91  of  its  decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal  properly
    directed itself that it must consider whether it would be  unreasonable
    for EA to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  (and  live  in  Nigeria).   The
    reasoning thereafter on this issue belies a  flawed  approach  to  that
    consideration.

16. As of the date of its decision the First-tier Tribunal were required to
    follow  the  approach  identified  in  the  Presidential  decision   of
    Treebhawon and Others (Section 117B(6)) [2015] UKUT 00674.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal did exactly  that,  directing  itself  to  Treebhawon  at
    paragraph 97 of its decision.

17. However, subsequent to the FtT's  decision  the  Court  of  Appeal  has
    further clarified the law (as it always was)  in  its  decision  in  MA
    (Pakistan). The approach identified by  the  Court  of  Appeal  is  not
    consistent with that set  out  in  Treebhawon,  the  latter  unlawfully
    restricting  the  matters  a  Tribunal  must  take  into  account  when
    considering section 117B(6).

18. The consideration of the issue of whether it is unreasonable for SL  to
    leave the United Kingdom ought to have included within it  features  of
    the general circumstances of the child's  family  and  public  interest
    matters.  These were matters which were not taken into account  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal, for reasons which I have already identified.

19. I observe in particular that the First-tier Tribunal did not  weigh  in
    the balance the fact of the claimant's criminal  conviction,  a  matter
    which the Secretary of State did not rely upon under Appendix  FM  but,
    nevertheless, is a relevant consideration outwith the  Rules.  Nor  did
    the First-tier Tribunal take account of  the  fact  that  the  claimant
    deceitfully pursued his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection  -
    both before the Secretary of State and before the First-tier  Tribunal.
      A further factor that is relevant,  but  not  explicitly  taken  into
    account by the FtT, is the claimant's immigration history.

20. In my conclusion the failure of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  take  the
    correct approach in its consideration of section 117B(6) amounts to  an
    error of law capable of impacting on the outcome of the appeal and,  as
    a consequence, I set the First-tier Tribunal's decision aside.

21. Having expressed the  above  decision  at  the  hearing,  both  parties
    submitted that the appropriate course was for the matter to be remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal for further consideration.  I concur for the
    following reasons.  There needs to  be  a  complete  re-making  of  the
    Article 8 ground outside of the Rules, albeit on  the  basis  that  the
    claimant,  SL  (and  AE)  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  (parental)
    relationship.  This will require a considerable amount of fact finding.



22. The circumstances of the family as a whole, and the impact on AE of the
    decision to remove the claimant, will be of some significance.   Before
    me the claimant indicated that Social Services had produced a report on
    the family; however, his former lawyers advised that this report should
    not be placed before the First-tier Tribunal and he did not have a copy
    of that report at the hearing before the Upper Tribunal.  The report is
    clearly of relevance and must be produced to the FtT and  the  SSHD  in
    good time for the next hearing.  In addition, the  Secretary  of  State
    wishes to obtain further information  in  relation  to  the  claimant's
    criminal conviction, a matter which was not dealt with  in  any  detail
    before the First-tier Tribunal on the last occasion.

23. The matter will be remitted to the FtT for consideration of the Article
    8 ECHR claim outside the Rules.  The  decisions  of  the  FtT  made  in
    relation to the Refugee Convention, Humanitarian Protection, Article  2
    and Article 3 ECHR claims have not been appealed by  the  claimant  and
    there has been no indication as to the availability of  any  additional
    evidence which ought to lead to the scope of the re-making  to  include
    such grounds.  The claimant does not meet the requirements of  Appendix
    FM, for the reasons set out above.

Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision is set aside.

The appeal is remitted to the  FtT  for  the  reasons,  and  on  the  basis,
identified above.
