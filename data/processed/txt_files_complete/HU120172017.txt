For the Respondent:    Mr S Vokes, counsel instructed by D&A Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and the Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant a national of Iraq date of  birth  10  November  1985  was
    subject to a deportation order made  on  13  March  2014  and  appealed
    against that decision.  The Secretary of State's decision to  refuse  a
    human rights based claim was made on 8 August 2017.His  appeal  against
    that decision was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Aziz,  (the
    Judge) on 25 April 2018.Permission to appeal was given on 16 May 2018.

3.   The Claimant  had  entered  the  United  Kingdom  clandestinely  on  11
    September 2002 and claimed asylum about one  week  later.   His  asylum
    claim was refused and he was served with removal directions which  lead
    to an appeal which was dismissed and he became appeal rights exhausted.
     He was convicted at  Worcester  Crown  Court  on  23  March  2005  and
    sentenced  to  twelve  months'  imprisonment  in  a  youth   offender's
    institution.   There  was  no  appeal  against  either  conviction   or
    sentence.

4.   The Claimant applied for indefinite leave to  remain  in  January  2007
    which was refused in 2007 and  he  became  an  absconder.   Deportation
    documentation was sent and on 11 November 2011 the Claimant  responded.
    Ultimately the decision was made  after  appeals  and  the  deportation
    order was signed on  13  March  2014.   The  Claimant  sought  Assisted
    Voluntary Return in May 2014  but  that  was  rejected.   The  Claimant
    applied for voluntary return and the application was similarly rejected
    in 2015.  Further representations were made during 2016  and  2017  but
    the Claimant has at all material times remained in the United Kingdom.

5.   The basis of his human  rights  based  application  was  his  claim  to
    family life with children and a stepchild in the United  Kingdom.   His
    circumstances were extensively reviewed in the decision  of  the  Judge
    his appeal and allowed it on Article 8 ECHR grounds on the  basis  that
    it would be disproportionate for the Claimant to be separated from  his
    family particularly the two British national children (RA and RI)  with
    whom he and his British national partner/wife, Ms [M],  lived.  It  was
    not argued that it would be reasonable for the family  to  relocate  to
    Iraq. The judge had concluded that it would be unduly harsh to  do  so.
    There was a third child X who did  not  feature  significantly  in  the
    appeal or its outcome.

6.   Essentially the Secretary of State's complaint was that the  Judge  had
    failed to carry out the assessment of the Claimant's claim by reference
    to the Claimant's conduct in the United Kingdom and  its  relevance  to
    the assessment of the circumstances which  might  be  characterised  or
    were characterised as unduly harsh consequences.  Mr Jarvis argued that
    quite simply the  Judge  had  failed  to  set  the  Claimant's  history
    properly as the context bearing in mind the deportation  decision.   Mr
    Vokes argued that in fact by reference to the Judge's decision  he  had
    done as much as needed to be done to  properly  assess  the  Claimant's
    claim and had properly applied the law in relation to the decision.

7.   I reached the view that  the  Judge  had  failed  to  properly  set  in
    context the public interest in the Claimant's removal.   In  particular
    the Judge seems to have become fixed on the point that following  those
    earlier decisions  set  out  in  the  immigration   history   when  the
    Claimant was appeal rights exhausted that the Secretary of State should
    have removed him and  that  the  failure  to  remove  him  enabled  the
    Claimant to diminish the significance of the public interest.

8.   Mr Vokes argued that the impact  of  the  Claimant  being  required  to
    leave in terms of its impact on the Claimant's partner  a  UK  national
    and the two UK national children was so significant that it showed  the
    Judge was right in concluding  that  separation  and  its  consequences
    would have unduly harsh impacts on the Claimant's partner and  all  his
    children.  It was accepted by the Secretary of State that it would  not
    be reasonable and it would be unduly harsh for the  Claimant's  partner
    and children, RA and  RI,  to  move  to  Iraq.   Mr  Vokes  argued,  by
    reference to the decision, as much as needed to be  done  was  done  in
    terms of assessing the impact of the interference in  family  life  and
    its effects upon the best interests of RA and RI.  The child X  also  a
    British national fathered by the Claimant from a previous  relationship
    did not feature largely because of the limited contact that  was  being
    exercised between the Claimant and X.  The Judge concluded that insofar
    as X was concerned the  Judge  did  not  find  that  the  unduly  harsh
    considerations were met.

9.   It seemed to me that  read  as  a  whole,  on  the  evidence  that  was
    advanced, that there were deficiencies in the Judge's decision  and  in
    his analysis but that on the evidence the Claimant's position were  the
    matter to be looked at by another Tribunal  would  essentially  be  the
    same and the outcome was reasonably likely to be  the  same.   I  agree
    with Mr Jarvis that the Judge understated  whilst  addressing  it,  the
    public interest and in the light of the case of RLP [2017]  UKUT  00330
    (IAC) the Tribunal President Mr Justice  McCloskey  in  the  head  note
    summarised the position as follows:

         "In all cases where the public interest favouring deportation of an
         immigrant is potent and pressing, even  egregious  and  unjustified
         delay on the part of the  Secretary  of  State  in  the  underlying
         decision making processes in unlikely to tip  the  balance  in  the
         immigrant's favour in the proportionality  exercise  under  Article
         8(2) ECHR."

10.  I concluded that it remains a fact sensitive and  specific  matter  and
    the decision also relied upon of  Shou  Lin  Xu,  an  unreported  Upper
    Tribunal decision from 2014, is of some interest because Upper Tribunal
    Judge Gill said

         "It also follows that, in  the  event  that  consideration  of  the
         relevant Immigration Rule and guidance produced a negative  answer,
         the rationale of the Supreme Court ...  in  Patel  v  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 72 applies, that is,  the
         Secretary of State is entitled to proceed on the basis  that  those
         unlawfully in the UK will leave of their own  accord;  she  is  not
         obliged to remove an individual or issue a removal direction."

11.  It seems to me that was entirely  correct  and  that  diminished  to  a
    degree the consequences for the Claimant of his overstaying  by  choice
    and his continued  flouting  of  UK  immigration  controls.   This  was
    plainly applicable to himself but it does not diminish the impact  that
    his removal may have in terms of its effect upon his children.  To what
    extent his partner was in  knowledge  of  his  immigration  status  and
    circumstances perhaps to that point matters not but plainly once  again
    it is not an absolute position.

12.  I conclude therefore that the Judge's decision had contained errors  of
    law but that I do not find them material and that  any  other  Tribunal
    properly  considering  the  same  findings  of  fact,  which  were  not
    substantively disputed, would  in  all  likelihood  come  to  the  same
    conclusion.
