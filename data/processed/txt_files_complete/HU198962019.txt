Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Jacobs, Counsel instructed by J McCarthy
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Afghanistan born  on  the  1st  January
    1975. On the 1st April 2020 the First-tier Tribunal  (Judges  Easterman
    and Robinson) allowed his appeal on human rights grounds. The Secretary
    of State now has permission to appeal against that decision.


 2. The Respondent has lived in the United Kingdom since at least  February
    2003 when he first came to the attention of the immigration authorities
    by claiming asylum. He was then  28  and  he  used  the  name  Sabawoon
    Alikhel. He was refused asylum but remained here. No effort having been
    made to remove him the Secretary of State finally recognised  that  for
    pragmatic reasons he should  be  permitted  to  stay.  He  was  granted
    Indefinite Leave to  Remain  (ILR)  under  what  became  known  as  the
    'legacy' scheme in 2010.   He settled in London and  found  work  as  a
    butcher.   He paid taxes and has never claimed any state benefits.


 3. In February 2015 the Respondent applied for what is described as a  'No
    Time Limit' endorsement on his passport. When he did so,  he  gave  the
    name Mohammad Naeem Alikhel.  The Home Office responded by revoking his
    ILR on the grounds that he had used deception  when  he  obtained  that
    leave in the  name  Sabawoon  Alikhel.   The  Respondent  attempted  to
    regularise his position - apparently at  the  suggestion  of  the  Home
    Office - by making an application for leave to remain on  human  rights
    grounds, but this too was refused,  and  certified  with  reference  to
    s94(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The effect of that
    certificate is that the Respondent was deprived of a right  of  appeal.
    He sought judicial review, proceedings which were settled by consent.

 4. That was how this matter  came  before  the  panel  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in March of this year.   The Judges heard the evidence of  the
    Respondent and four additional  witnesses  before  hearing  submissions
    from the parties. Having done so they  reached  the  following  factual
    conclusions:

              i) That the Respondent was telling the truth when he described
                 Sabawoon as a nickname that he is commonly known by.


             ii) He had gained nothing from the use of the name, which he is
                 known by to this day.

            iii) There is nothing in law which prevents the Respondent  from
                 using the name Sabawoon.

             iv) Nor was there any lawful impediment to him using both names
                 if he wished to do so.

              v) The only reason that  the  Respondent  disclosed  the  name
                 Mohammad Naeem Alikhel in 2015 was because  he  wanted  his
                 official documents in this country to be  brought  in  line
                 with his official documents in Afghanistan, viz an identity
                 card that he had been issued with as a child.

             vi) In light of the above  it  has  not  been  shown  that  the
                 Respondent ever used deception.

 5. From these findings of fact the Tribunal proceeded to consider the case
    within the legal framework permitted to it in the context  of  a  human
    rights appeal. It first considered whether the Respondent qualified for
    leave  under  paragraph  276ADE(1).  He  didn't.  Then   the   Tribunal
    considered Appendix  FM.  He  didn't  qualify  for  leave  under  those
    provisions either. Turning to Article 8  'outside  of  the  rules'  the
    Tribunal noted that the Respondent's case appears to fall into a lacuna
    not envisaged by the drafters of the  rules.  Having  had  ILR  he  was
    wrongly deprived of it, exposing him to the risk of prosecution,  fines
    and imprisonment for remaining here with no status;  he  is  unable  to
    work, rent a home, claim benefits or receive NHS treatment. He  is  not
    even permitted to drive or have a bank account. Absent any  finding  of
    deception there was nothing on the Secretary of  State's  side  of  the
    scales to say that refusing leave would be  proportionate.  The  appeal
    was therefore allowed.


 6. The Secretary of State appeals on the ground that the  Tribunal  failed
    to articulate where  the  breach  of  Article  8  would  arise  if  the
    Respondent is refused leave, or indeed  removed  to  Afghanistan.   The
    Secretary of State further submits that since the Respondent failed  to
    meet the requirements of the rules it was incumbent upon  the  Tribunal
    to consider the public interest as articulated  in  s117B  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.



    Discussion and Findings

 7. Permission to appeal should never have been sought, or granted, in this
    case.


 8. The legal framework for the determination of Article 8 appeals in  this
    jurisdiction may appear to be complex but in fact it is  quite  simple.
    Decision makers must first assess whether the  claimant  can  meet  the
    requirements of any immigration rule.  That is the first port  of  call
    because the rules, or at least those rules expressly  framed  as  such,
    have been approved by parliament as being reflective of where,  in  the
    vast majority of cases, the balance between the Article 8(1) rights  of
    the individual and the Article 8(2) rights  of  the  state  are  to  be
    struck.  If the claimant cannot meet the relevant requirement, that  is
    not the end of the matter. The drafters of the rules cannot be expected
    to have legislated for each and every permutation of human life and its
    interaction with authority. There will always be cases where there is a
    good reason to conclude that a refusal of leave would  be  contrary  to
    the United Kingdom's obligations under the European Convention.

 9. In this case the Respondent could not hope to meet any of the  relevant
    rules. The Tribunal quite correctly identified, however,  that  on  the
    peculiar facts of his case, the rules were largely  irrelevant  because
    they simply did not address his situation. The Tribunal were  therefore
    required to assess the proportionality of the  situation  in  light  of
    that lacuna.

10. This was a man who had held ILR in the United Kingdom for  many  years.
    He had here an established private life and the legitimate  expectation
    that he would - absent some unforeseen event like  serious  criminality
    or a dramatic change in the law - be permitted to remain here  for  the
    rest of his life. All of that was taken away from him in 2018 when  the
    Secretary of State unilaterally revoked his ILR on the grounds that  he
    had exercised deception. But for that decision,  the  Respondent  would
    still be working as a butcher,  would still be entitled to the  various
    legal advantages that settled status brings, and would still  have  his
    ILR.     This was why the parties before the First-tier Tribunal agreed
    that the only matter in issue was whether the Respondent  had  in  fact
    exercised deception.   If he had then the public interest  in  refusing
    him leave would have been so substantial that it is  difficult  to  see
    how, on the facts, it could have been overcome. If on the other hand he
    had not, there was nothing at all weighing on the Secretary of  State's
    side of the scales.

11. The first ground of appeal is that the First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to
    identify how the decision to refuse leave might  have  interfered  with
    the Respondent's private life. This ground is without  any  foundation.
    The  Tribunal  sets  out  at  its  �57  why  this  decision  manifestly
    interfered with multiple facets of the life  that  the  Respondent  has
    established here for himself (see my �5 above).

12. The second ground is that the First-tier Tribunal failed to have regard
    to the public interest as codified in  s117B  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.   It is true that the Tribunal does not  expressly
    make findings on all of these matters.  Section 117B is however set out
    in its entirety earlier in the  decision,  and  I  have  no  reason  to
    believe  that  the   Tribunal   excluded   those   matters   from   its
    consideration. Furthermore the fact is that a comprehensive  evaluation
    of each of the public interest factors at s117B(1)-(5) could  not  have
    added anything to the Secretary of State's case. It is  in  the  public
    interest that immigration control is  maintained:  the  Respondent  was
    fully compliant with the terms of his grant of  leave.  It  is  in  the
    public interest that  claimants  are  financially  independent:  before
    being stripped of his status and being unable to work, he was. It is in
    the public interest that claimants can speak English: he can.   Finally
    little weight is to be attached to a private life established when  the
    Appellant was  here  unlawfully  or  when  status  is  precarious:  the
    Respondent places reliance on the  private  life  established  in  this
    country since he was granted indefinite leave  to  remain,  leave  that
    applying Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]
    UKSC 58 [at �44] cannot be described as  "precarious".   As  Mrs  Aboni
    rightly accepted, in those circumstances the First-tier Tribunal  could
    have done nothing but allow this appeal.


13.  I  therefore  dismiss  the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal.  The  only
    unsatisfactory thing about the First-tier Tribunal decision is the fact
    that its effect, insofar as the Respondent is concerned, is that he  is
    now entitled to 30 months' leave to remain. He will thereafter will  be
    placed on a '10 year route' back to settlement  which  will  involve  a
    number of applications and many  thousands  of  pounds  in  application
    fees. In light of the history of  this  matter,  and  the  unchallenged
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal, the Secretary  of  State  will  no
    doubt give anxious  consideration  at  a  high  level  to  whether  the
    Respondent  should  simply  have  his  indefinite   leave   to   remain
    reinstated, and any of the usual fees waived.     The  question  of  an
    apology, and any financial restitution for the losses suffered  by  the
    Respondent, is a matter to be resolved between the parties.



    Decisions


14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law and it
    is upheld.  The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.

15. There is no order for anonymity.
