(Cardiff)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly identify the  appellant.   This  direction
    applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and  a  failure  to
    comply with this direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

Introduction

 2. This determination sets out the decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  re-
    making the decision under Art  15(c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive
    (Council  Directive  2004/83/EC)  following  my  decision  sent  on  13
    September 2019 that the First-tier Tribunal (Judge L Murray) materially
    erred in law in dismissing the appellant's appeal under Art 15(c).

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq who comes from Kirkuk City.  He  was
    born on 25 September 1988.  He arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  6
    January 2009 and, the following day, he claimed asylum.  The  Secretary
    of State refused that claim on 28 July 2009 and his  subsequent  appeal
    was dismissed on 22 September 2009.

 4. The appellant made further submissions which were refused on 19 January
    2011 and 27 May 2016.  His application for judicial review, in relation
    to the latter decision, was rejected on  6  January  2017.   A  further
    refusal followed on 8 March 2017 and again his application for judicial
    review, challenging that decision, was rejected on 18 October 2017.

 5. The appellant again made further submissions which were refused  on  19
    December  2017.   The  appellant  appealed  that  decision  which   was
    dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal in a decision  sent  on  22  March
    2018.  That decision was, however, set aside by the Upper Tribunal on 8
    November 2018 and the appeal was remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for a rehearing.

 6. The hearing in the remitted appeal took place before Judge L Murray  on
    11 February 2019.  In her determination, sent on 12 March  2019,  Judge
    Murray dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds.

 7. The appellant sought and was granted permission to appeal to the  Upper
    Tribunal by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Pedro) on 15 April 2019.

The Appeal in the Upper Tribunal

 8. The appeal was initially heard by me in the Upper Tribunal on 1  August
    2019.  In my decision sent on 12 September 2019, I concluded  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal had erred in  law  in  dismissing  the  appellant's
    appeal under Art 15(c).  Indeed, that was conceded by the Secretary  of
    State at the hearing.  The decision to dismiss  the  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds stood.  The appeal was adjourned for a further hearing  to  re-
    make the decision in respect of Art 15(c).

 9. The appeal was eventually relisted at the Cardiff Civil Justice  Centre
    on 29 October 2020.  As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, the appeal was
    heard remotely by Skype for Business.  I was based in the Cardiff Civil
    Justice Centre and Ms Gunn,  who  represented  the  appellant,  and  Mr
    Howells, who represented the Secretary of  State,  joined  the  hearing
    remotely by Skype for Business.

10. In addition, the appellant and his sister  ("SN")  gave  oral  evidence
    remotely via Skype.   The  appellant's  evidence  was  given  with  the
    assistance of an interpreter who also joined the hearing remotely.

11. I heard oral submissions from both representatives and Ms  Gunn  relied
    upon a detailed skeleton argument.

12. In addition, the appellant relied upon an up-to-date bundle of evidence
    including a psychiatric report from Dr Battersby dated 10 February 2020
    and an expert report on Iraq by  Professor  Christoph  Bluth  dated  27
    October 2020.  Mr Howells did  not  object  to  the  admission  of  the
    additional evidence in the bundle which had previously not been  before
    the First-tier Tribunal and I admitted that evidence under rule  15(2A)
    of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

The Appellant's Case

13. The appellant relied exclusively upon Art 15(c).   Ms  Gunn  placed  no
    reliance upon Art 8 of the ECHR.

14. In  essence,  Ms  Gunn  submitted  that  applying  the  'sliding-scale'
    applicable to Art 15(c) and the country  guidance  decision  of  SMO  &
    Others (Article 15(c); identity documents)  Iraq  CG  [2019]  UKUT  400
    (IAC) ("SMO and Others") the appellant had established a real  risk  of
    serious harm arising  from  indiscriminate  violence  contrary  to  Art
    15(c).  She relied upon:

      1) the security situation in Kirkuk City;

      2) the psychiatric evidence concerning the appellant's  mental  health
         and his diagnosis of moderate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
         and moderate depressive disorder;

      3) the lack of availability of medical treatment for mental health  on
         return to Kirkuk City; and

      4) the appellant having no support from family in Kirkuk City,  as  he
         had lost contact with his mother.

    Further, Ms Gunn contended that  the  appellant  could  not  internally
    relocate to Baghdad (no other place of internal relocation  was  relied
    upon by Mr Howells) because he  had  no  support  there,  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect him to live in Baghdad given  his  circumstances
    and as a non-Arab (Kurd).

    It was accepted before me that the  appellant  has  a  CSID  and  would
    return with that document such that no risk  arises  in  Iraq  due  its
    absence.

The Law

15. In relation to the appellant's humanitarian protection claim under  Art
    15(c) of the Qualification Directive, the appellant must establish that
    there are substantial grounds for believing that he is at real risk  of
    serious harm as a result of a serious and individual threat to his life
    by reason of indiscriminate violence.

16. Paragraph 339O of the  Immigration  Rules  (reflecting  Art  8  of  the
    Qualification Directive) is as follows:

         "339O    (i)  The Secretary of State will not make:


                  (a)  a grant of refugee status if in part of the country
                  of origin a person would not have a well founded fear of
                  being persecuted, and the person can reasonably be
                  expected to stay in that part of the country; or


                  (b)  a grant of humanitarian protection if in part of the
                  country of return a person would not face a real risk of
                  suffering serious harm, and the person can reasonably be
                  expected to stay in that part of the country.


              (ii)    In examining whether a part of the country of origin
              or country of return meets the requirements in (i) the
              Secretary of State, when making a decision on whether to
              grant asylum or humanitarian protection, will have regard to
              the general circumstances prevailing in that part of the
              country and to the personal circumstances of the person.


              (iii)   (i) applies notwithstanding technical obstacles to
              return to the country of origin or country of return."


17. There are two limbs:

      a) will the appellant be exposed to a real risk of serious harm in the
         place of proposed internal relocation (here Baghdad)?; and

      b) if not, will it be reasonable (or unduly harsh) for  the  appellant
         to live in the place of proposed relocation (here Baghdad)?

18. The approach to 'reasonableness' and 'undue harshness' was analysed  by
    the House of Lords in Januzi v SSHD [2006] UKHL 5 and AH (Sudan) v SSHD
    [2006] UKHL 49.  The Court of Appeal provided a helpful summary of  the
    law, drawing together the earlier cases, in  AS  (Afghanistan)  v  SSHD
    [2019] EWCA Civ 873.  At [61] Underhill LJ (with whom  King  and  Singh
    LJJ agreed) said:

         "61. I start  by  summarising  the  essential  points,  so  far  as
         relevant to this appeal, established by the authorities  about  the
         nature of the exercise required by article 8 of  the  Directive.  I
         emphasise that this is not intended as a comprehensive analysis  of
         all the issues raised by the authorities to which I have referred.


             (1)  By way of preliminary, internal relocation  is  obviously
             not an alternative  where  there  is  a  real  risk  that  the
             applicant for asylum will suffer persecution, or serious  harm
             within the meaning of  article  15  of  the  Directive  (which
             includes treatment which would be contrary to article 3 of the
             ECHR), in the putative safe haven. We are concerned with cases
             where there is no such risk.


             (2)  The ultimate question is whether in such a  case  "taking
             account  of  all  relevant  circumstances  pertaining  to  the
             claimant and his country of origin, ... it  is  reasonable  to
             expect the claimant to relocate or whether it would be  unduly
             harsh to expect him to do so". That is the formulation of Lord
             Bingham in Januzi, repeated in AH (Sudan).  It  pre-dates  the
             Directive and is not identically worded:  in  particular,  the
             reference to whether relocation would be "unduly harsh" is not
             present  in  article  8  but  derives  from  the  UNHCR   2003
             Guidelines (see Januzi, para. 20). But it  was  common  ground
             before us that it states the test required by  article  8  [of
             the Qualification Directive]. When in  doubt  it  is  to  that
             question that tribunals should return.


             (3)  The test so stated is one of great generality (save  only
             that it excludes any comparison of the  conditions,  including
             the  degree  of  respect  for  human  rights,  between   those
             obtaining in the safe haven and those of the country of refuge
             - this being the ratio of Januzi). It  requires  consideration
             of all matters relevant to the reasonableness  of  relocation,
             none having inherent priority over  the  others  (AH  (Sudan),
             para. 13). This is the same as Lady Hale's description of  the
             necessary assessment as "holistic" (AH (Sudan) paras. 27-28).


             (4)  One way of approaching that assessment is to ask  whether
             in the safe haven the applicant can lead "a relatively  normal
             life without facing undue hardship ... in the context  of  the
             country concerned".  That  language  derives  from  the  UNHCR
             Guidelines and is quoted by  Lord  Bingham  with  approval  in
             Januzi (para. 20) and also used by Lord Hope (para.  47);  but
             it does not appear in  the  Directive  or  in  Lord  Bingham's
             formulation of the test, and it should not  be  treated  as  a
             substitute for the latter. Rather, it is  a  valuable  way  of
             approaching the reasonableness analysis - "one touchstone", as
             Lord Brown puts it (AH (Sudan) para. 42). Its value is because
             if a person is able to lead in the safe haven a life which  is
             relatively normal for people in the context of his or her  own
             country, it will be reasonable to expect them  to  stay  there
             (AH (Sudan), para. 47).


             (5)  It may be reasonable, and not unduly harsh, to  expect  a
             refugee to relocate even if conditions in the safe haven  are,
             by the standards of the country of refuge, very bad.  That  is
             part of what is decided by Januzi  itself,  and  the  passages
             quoted at paras. 34 and 35 above  reinforce  it.  It  is  also
             vividly illustrated by the outcome of AH  (Sudan),  where  the
             House of Lords upheld the decision of  the  AIT  that  it  was
             reasonable for Darfuri refugees to be expected to relocate  to
             the camps  or  squatter  slums  of  Khartoum.  That  may  seem
             inconsistent with the suggested approach of asking whether the
             applicant would be able lead a "relatively normal life" in the
             safe haven; but the reconciliation lies in  the  qualification
             "in the context of the country concerned".


             (6)  Point (5) does not mean that it will be reasonable for  a
             person to relocate to a safe haven, however bad the conditions
             they will face there, as long as such conditions are normal in
             their country.  Conditions  may  be  normal  but  nevertheless
             unduly harsh: this is the point emphasised by Lady Hale in  AH
             (Sudan) and is exemplified by AA (Uganda).


             (7)  The UNHCR Guidelines contain a full discussion of factors
             relevant to the reasonableness analysis. These  are  described
             by Lord Bingham as "valuable" and partly quoted by him (Januzi
             para. 20); and at para. 20 of her opinion in AH  (Sudan)  Lady
             Hale endorses a submission made in that case  by  UNHCR  which
             summarises the factors  in  question.  A  decision-maker  must
             consider those factors, so  far  as  material,  in  each  case
             (though it  does  not  follow  that  everything  said  in  the
             detailed discussion in the Guidelines is authoritative).


             (8)   The  assessment  must  in  each  case  be  conducted  by
             reference  to  the  reasonableness  of  relocation   for   the
             particular individual."


Preserved Findings

19. A number of findings made by Judge Murray are preserved.

      1) The appellant's father, who worked as a chef within an oil  company
         where many Americans worked in Kirkuk City, was killed as part of a
         terrorist attack either directly targeted at him or as an  innocent
         bystander.

      2) The appellant was present when that attack took place  but  it  was
         not established that the terrorists who caused his father's  death,
         despite  the  appellant's  genuine  fear,  had  any   interest   in
         persecuting him  on  return.   A  death  threat  addressed  to  the
         appellant, which had been found in the garden of a  friend  of  the
         appellant's mother, was found not to be a reliable document.

      3) The appellant's mother  has  remained  in  Kirkuk  City  since  the
         appellant's departure.

20. It was on the basis of those findings that Judge Murray  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal on asylum grounds which was unchallenged.

The Oral Evidence

    The Appellant

21.  At  the  hearing,  the  appellant  gave  oral  evidence   through   an
    interpreter.  Before Judge Murray, the appellant had been accepted as a
    vulnerable witness.  Although that issue was not specifically drawn  to
    my attention, I was conscious during  the  course  of  the  appellant's
    evidence that he was a vulnerable witness (on the basis of  the  mental
    health evidence) and I sought to give the appellant  opportunities  for
    breaks if he needed them.  In fact, he did not wish to have any breaks.
     I am, nevertheless,  acutely  aware  that  during  his  evidence,  the
    appellant often had difficulty appreciating what was being asked of him
    and, in many of his answers, simply replied that he did not know,  what
    was being asked of him was a long time ago and he did not remember.   I
    formed the clear impression that this style of answer was  genuine  and
    not an attempt  to  prevaricate  or  avoid  answering  a  difficult  or
    unwanted question.

22. In his evidence, the appellant adopted his  statement  of  27  February
    2020.  In that statement, at para 12, he said:

         "I have no contact with my mum.  She is old  now  and  has  hearing
         problems.  The last I knew she was living with friends as  she  did
         not want to live alone after I left Iraq".

23. Ms Gunn asked the appellant about that evidence and when  he  had  last
    had contact with his mother.  He replied that he did not  remember,  it
    was many, many years ago.

24. In cross-examination, the appellant was asked questions about a  number
    of issues concerning his circumstances.

25. He confirmed that the family home was  in  the  city  of  Kirkuk.   The
    appellant said that his mother had sold the family home  after  he  had
    left Iraq.  She had moved in with  a  friend.   He  did  not  know  the
    friend's name or address.  It was in a different area  in  Kirkuk  City
    and he could not remember the exact address.  He was asked  about  when
    he last had contact with his mother, he said that he could not remember
    but it was a long time ago.  He said contact had been by phone.  It was
    a long time ago and he did not know anything about her now.  He said he
    could not remember whether he rang her or she  rang  him.   When  asked
    whether his sister was in contact with their mother, he said he did not
    know.  When asked whether he had asked his sister about this,  he  said
    "not really, no".  He said that he thought his sister had lost  contact
    with his mother.  He was asked why he should be believed given that the
    judge had previously not found the  document  relied  upon  by  him  as
    showing a terrorist threat to  be  reliable.   The  appellant  said  he
    should be believed because we (meaning he and his sister) do  not  have
    contact with his mother.

26. He was asked about his maternal uncle in Baghdad  who  had  funded  his
    journey to the UK.  It was pointed out that in  his  interview  he  had
    said that an agent had been paid $10,000.  The appellant said that  "to
    be honest, I don't remember exactly how much he gave".   He  was  asked
    when he last had contact with his uncle and he said that he had not had
    contact with him since he had left Iraq.  He  was  asked  why,  if  his
    uncle had been so concerned about him previously,  there  had  been  no
    contact.  The appellant said that when  he  left  he  don't  know  what
    happened to him.  He said that he had had no contact since he  came  to
    the UK.  It was put to him that the truth was that he had contact  with
    both his mother and his uncle but the appellant replied that he did not
    have any contact with them.  He said he would like to contact them  but
    his uncle has disappeared, what can he do.

27. The appellant was asked questions about work both in Iraq and  the  UK.
    As regards work in Iraq, he agreed that he had helped his father  as  a
    chef.  In the UK, his attention was drawn to a number of letters in the
    bundle which, it was put to him, said he was doing voluntary work as  a
    barber.  The letters are at G1 and H1 of the respondent's bundle.   The
    appellant said that he was not working in a job or  as  a  professional
    barber.  Rather he was helping out at a church where he cut  hair.   He
    said that he had not been a barber in Iraq, the church had  taught  him
    how to cook and cut hair and if it was  being  suggested  that  he  was
    working as a barber, then that was a mistake.

28. The appellant was also asked about what languages he  spoke.   He  said
    that Kurdish was his mother tongue but he had learnt Arabic in  school.
    He was asked whether he had translated from Arabic in the UK.  He  said
    that he had not.  In church he had helped Kurdish people  with  English
    with such things as dates of birth, names, things like that.   When  he
    was asked why in the letter at H1 it was said that he had assisted  the
    writer in her advocacy work and had "regularly translated  from  Sorani
    or Arabic", the appellant said that he had translated small things  but
    no more.

29. The appellant was asked about his mental health and said  that  he  was
    currently taking  his  medication.   He  said  that  he  used  to  have
    counselling and therapy but that had finished.  He could  not  remember
    when he last had counselling or therapy.

30. The appellant was asked whether his sister was in contact  with  anyone
    in Iraq and he said he did not know.  He said  he  had  not  asked  her
    about that.  He said that he thought she  had  been  back  to  Iraq  on
    holiday since she first came to the UK in 2004 but he did not know.  He
    did not know where she had gone and did not know whether she saw family
    or friends.  He was asked whether, if he returned to Iraq,  his  sister
    would send him money and he said he did not think so.  She had children
    and her own family in the UK and she could not cope  with  funding  his
    life.  He said she helped him in the UK but not with  much  money,  she
    did buy him clothes and tickets and she came to see him.

31. As regards his uncle in Baghdad, he did  not  accept  that  he  was  in
    contact with his uncle and that he could not  go  to  live  in  Baghdad
    where the situation was bad and that he had lived in the UK for  twelve
    years.

32. There was no re-examination.

    The Appellant's Sister - "SN"

33. The appellant's sister, SN, gave oral evidence in which she adopted her
    statement of 27 October 2020.

34. In cross-examination, SN was asked about her mother in Kirkuk Cty.  She
    was asked whether it was her evidence that her mother had moved out  of
    the house in Kirkuk but that she did not know what had happened to her.
     SN replied that she did not know, she did not have  any  family  there
    and she did not know what had happened to her mother.   She  was  asked
    whether she was in contact with her mother and she  said  she  had  not
    been in contact for two years.  It was put to SN that the appellant had
    said that the family home had been sold, SN replied that  it  had  been
    sold when her father had died.  Her mother had sold  it  and  had  told
    them that she had done so.  It was put to SN that  in  para  9  of  her
    witness statement, she had said that she did not know what had happened
    to the house; in response she said she did not  know  "to  be  honest".
    She said she did not know whether her mother had left the  family  home
    in Kirkuk.  She said she had last been in contact with  her  two  years
    ago.  She had kept calling her but the phone did not  ring.   When  she
    was last in contact, SN said, that her mother was in  a  friend's  home
    and she gave the name of that friend but she did not know the  address.
    It was in the city but she did not write it down.   She  said  she  had
    tried a few times to phone her mother, on her mobile, but  it  did  not
    ring so she had stopped.

35. SN was asked about an email (at U10 of the bundle)  in  which  she  had
    said it was very hard to keep in contact with her mother; it  was  very
    hard to talk to her.  Why had she not said that she had  last  been  in
    contact with her mother  sometime  before.   (In  answer  to  my  later
    question, SN confirmed that she had written this email prior to the  UT
    hearing in 2019).  SN replied that she had no contact with her  mother,
    the phone did not ring.

36. SN also confirmed that she  was  not  in  contact  with  her  uncle  in
    Baghdad.  She also said that the appellant  was  not  in  contact  with
    their uncle.  She had not been in contact with her uncle since she  had
    been in the UK.  She said that she was not in contact  with  anyone  in
    Iraq.

37. SN said that she had a British passport and she had come to the  UK  in
    2004.  She said that she had been  back  to  Iraq  since  she  got  her
    British passport.  Initially, when asked how many times, she  said  she
    could not remember and when she was asked roughly how many  times,  she
    said she did not want to give the wrong answer but maybe  three  times.
    The last time was last summer when she went to Erbil.   She  said  that
    she had been to Erbil on the previous occasions, she had gone there for
    a visit, for tourism.  She said she did not have family there.

38. SN was asked whether she financially supported her brother and she said
    that she did.  She said she  could  continue  to  do  so.   When  asked
    whether she could continue to do that if he returned to Iraq, she  said
    she could not send money, she did not know how.  It was easy for her in
    the UK but how was she going to support him there.  It was suggested to
    her that it could be done through transfer agencies but she replied she
    did not know.  She said she supported him in the UK emotionally  as  he
    was alone.  When it was put  to  her  that  she  would  not  allow  the
    appellant to be destitute in Iraq, she replied that she could not  help
    him if he was there.

39. There was no re-examination.

The Submissions

    The Respondent

40. Mr Howells invited me to make a  number  of  further  factual  findings
    based upon the evidence I had heard.

41. Mr Howells invited me to find that the appellant would have  a  support
    network on return, in the sense that he had not established he had lost
    contact with his mother or uncle.  He relied on  the  fact  that  Judge
    Murray had made some adverse findings against the appellant,  including
    the reliability of a letter left in the  garden  of  a  friend  of  his
    mother's threatening him.  He submitted that if there was  no  specific
    threat from ISIS, the appellant's mother had no reason to move from her
    home although, Mr Howells accepted, that for cultural reasons she might
    have moved to live with a friend following the death  of  her  husband,
    the appellant's father.

42. Mr Howells relied on a number of credibility issues  arising  from  the
    oral evidence.  First, he said that the appellant  had  said  that  his
    mother had sold the family home after he left; he had  said  that  both
    before Judge Murray and  in  his  evidence  before  me.   However,  the
    appellant's sister said in her evidence that it was not sold (at  least
    initially) and then she had said it was sold.  There was  a  change  in
    her evidence.   Secondly,  the  appellant's  sister  also  changed  her
    evidence about contact with their mother.  In her  oral  evidence,  she
    had said that she had not had contact with her  mother  for  about  two
    years but in the email, sent prior to the August 2019 hearing (at  U10)
    she did not mention that.  The  letter  seemed  to  suggest  there  was
    contact but difficulties in maintaining it.  Thirdly, the  evidence  of
    the appellant and his sister about contact with their mother was  vague
    and lacking in detail.

43. He invited me to find that neither the appellant  or  his  sister  were
    telling the truth that they had lost contact  with  their  mother.   In
    relation to their uncle, Mr Howells submitted that the uncle  had  paid
    $10,000 but the appellant also said he had  had  no  contact  with  him
    since he left Iraq.  That, Mr Howells submitted, was most unlikely.

44. As regards support, Mr Howells  submitted  that  if  the  evidence  was
    correct that the appellant's mother had sold the family home, there was
    a possibility of other sources of income beyond the  pension  which  it
    was said she received.  Likewise, the appellant's sister was  currently
    financially supporting him in the UK and she had given no cogent reason
    why that support could not continue if  he  returned  to  Iraq.   Also,
    given that his uncle in Iraq had spent $10,000 to pay for his  trip  to
    the UK, he was likely to be relatively well-to-do.  Mr Howells  invited
    me to find that the appellant would have the emotional support  of  his
    mother (in Kirkuk City) and his uncle (in Baghdad) and  also  financial
    support from them and his sister in the UK.

45. Whilst accepting that the  appellant  has  health  problems,  PTSD  and
    depressive disorder of moderate severity, and  that  the  provision  of
    mental health facilities was limited in Iraq, Mr Howells submitted that
    there was nevertheless some mental health provision available;  it  was
    not completely absent.  Mr Howells pointed out that it did  not  appear
    to be part of the claim that his current medication was  not  available
    and Professor Bluth in his expert report, did not make  such  a  claim.
    There was also no claim that the appellant was a suicide risk.

46. Mr Howells submitted that the appellant would not be a person returning
    with no skills or job.  He had  studied  classics  at  school,  he  had
    worked as a chef with his father in Iraq and, although he disputed  it,
    two letters said that he  had  done  some  voluntary  work  in  the  UK
    including as a barber.  He spoke Kurdish and had been taught in Arabic,
    and had acquired a competence in English whilst in the UK.

47. Mr Howells submitted that following SMO & Others, there was no  general
    Art 15(c) risk in Kirkuk City.  He referred me to the evidence at [25]-
    [50] and the analysis of the UT at [251]-[257].

48. Mr  Howells  submitted  that,  on  the  basis  of  the  'sliding-scale'
    assessment the appellant was relying upon  the  security  situation  in
    Kirkuk, and his personal characteristics,  namely  his  mental  health,
    that he had a disability and no support network.  Mr Howells invited me
    to find on the basis of  the  evidence  that  these  factors  were  not
    established and did not  demonstrate  a  real  risk  of  indiscriminate
    violence to the appellant.

49. Mr Howells submitted there was no issue concerning any risk arising  on
    return for the appellant due to a lack of a CSID  as  it  was  accepted
    that he had a CSID which had been provided to the Home Office.

50. Finally, in relation to internal relocation, Mr Howells  accepted  that
    the only option relied on was return to Baghdad.  He submitted that the
    appellant had an uncle in Baghdad, he was competent  in  Arabic  having
    been taught in Arabic at school and had done some  translation  in  the
    UK.  He referred me to [425(48)] of SMO & Others and invited me to find
    that the appellant had external support in the form of a maternal uncle
    and that it would be reasonable for him to live in Baghdad.

    The Appellant

51. Ms Gunn relied upon her skeleton argument which she developed,  in  the
    light of the evidence, in her oral submissions.

52. First, she relied upon SMO & Others and, in particular,  the  'sliding-
    scale' assessment identified as applicable to an  Art  15(c)  claim  in
    Iraq.  She relied upon the security situation in Kirkuk set out in  the
    evidence in SMO & Others at [252] and onwards.  In addition, she relied
    upon the report of Professor Bluth and, in particular, two passages  in
    his report where he said that: "It remains the case  that  violence  in
    Kirkuk is endemic" (W21), and also where he commented that the security
    situation in Kirkuk was compounded by escalating  political  unrest  in
    Baghdad (in late 2011) which  was  preventing  the  federal  government
    taking steps to improve security in Kirkuk (W24).

53. Further, Ms Gunn relied upon a report of the  Iraq  Humanitarian  Fund,
    "iMMAP - Iraq Humanitarian Response: ISIS Sleeper Cells Activities amid
    the COVID-19 Pandemic" (at V216) noting that:

         "From January to August 2020,  ISIS  caused  292  incidents  taking
         place mainly in Diyala, followed by Anbar,  Kirkuk,  Salah  al-Din,
         Mosul,  Erbil,  and  Baghdad,  which  experienced  fewer  incidents
         compared to other provinces".

54. She also relied on an article from the Middle East  Institute,  "ISIS's
    dramatic escalation in Syria and Iraq" noting an increase by:

         "At least 69 percent in April 2020 (171 attacks), a marked increase
         that  comes  amid  US  military   withdrawals   from   remote   but
         strategically key posts in Iraq, the arrival and  challenges  posed
         by COVID-19 to the region, and continuing political  stagnation  in
         Baghdad".

55. And, further (at V222) that :

         "The most dramatic recent escalation in ISIS activity has  come  in
         Iraq, where the group has especially increased  attacks  in  Kirkuk
         (by as much as 200 percent) and Diyala (with near-daily  attacks)".



56. Further, Ms Gunn relied upon  the  'personal  characteristics'  of  the
    appellant.  She relied on the  medical/psychiatric  evidence  that  the
    appellant suffered  from  PTSD  and  depressive  disorder  of  moderate
    severity as reported by Dr Battersby (at U33).  There was  no  evidence
    that health facilities were available to  the  appellant.   She  relied
    upon  Dr  Battersby's  opinion  that  the  appellant's   antidepressant
    medication should be increased and that  he  would  require  about  six
    months of therapy.  She also relied upon Dr Battersby's  concerns  that
    there would be an impact upon the appellant's mental health if he  were
    returned to Iraq and was unable to see his  sister  and  her  children.
    She relied upon Dr Battersby's view that it was  "highly  likely"  that
    "without her support the severity of his mental health  problems  would
    increase" (U41).

57. In relation to availability of mental health treatment, Ms Gunn  relied
    upon a number of background documents which she set out at para  56  of
    her skeleton argument: the Report of  the  Special  Rapporteur  on  the
    human rights of internally displaced persons, "visit to Iraq"  (13  May
    2020) (at V45) noting the lack of access to  healthcare  at  specialist
    mental health and psycho-social support services  for  those  who  have
    experienced traumatic events was "mostly  absent".   In  addition,  she
    relied on the EASO, "Country guidance: Iraq Guidance  Note  and  Common
    Analysis" (June 2019) (at V148 and V147) where it is reported:

         "With regard to mental health, it has been reported that there  are
         huge needs and the available  services  do  not  meet  the  demand.
         Challenges to the mental health system in Iraq include the lack  of
         funding  and  infrastructure,  limited  number  of  mental   health
         professionals, location of services, and they  are  often  too  far
         away for people to travel, as well as stigma".

58. The report also states (at V147) that:

         "Persons  with  disabilities  face   a   wide   array   of   social
         discrimination.  The prevailing perception among the public  is  to
         treat persons with disabilities as charity.   According  to  UNAMI,
         persons  with  disabilities  'face  common  experiences  of   often
         multiple, intersecting and  aggravated  forms   of   discrimination
         which  hinder,  prevent  or  impair   their   full   enjoyment   of
         their  rights  and  their  full  and  equal  participation  in  all
          aspects  of  society'.  ... Adults and children with  disabilities
         are at a higher risk of violence than non-disabled, and those  with
         mental illnesses could be particularly vulnerable".

59. Ms Gunn also relied  upon  the  CPIN,  "Iraq:  Medical  and  healthcare
    issues" (May 2019) which, in summary, concluded that there  were  "very
    limited psycho-social support services" and  that  these  were  "mostly
    offered by private institutes, although at a cost that  is  prohibitive
    for most families" (see para 15.1.1).  Further, the CPIN said  that  in
    2007 there were only "80 practicing psychologists  in  Iraq  and  Iraqi
    Kurdistan" (see para 15.1.3).

60. Ms Gunn also relied upon the report of  Professor  Bluth  that  "health
    infrastructure in Iraq  is  at  a  very  low  level  even  by  regional
    standards" (at W5), noting the current level of psychiatrists was  four
    per million residents (W10); that there is  a  stigma  associated  with
    mental illness (W12); a shortage of health services particularly  as  a
    result of the COVID-19 crisis (W12) and that (at W19):

         "The appellant is highly unlikely to receive the  consistent  long-
         term treatment required for his condition and is  at  serious  risk
         that  is  further  aggravated  by  the  lack  of  support  for  and
         discrimination towards people with disabilities in his home  region
         as well as the high level of violence that is  still  prevalent  in
         North Iraq".

61. Ms Gunn invited me to make a factual finding, based on the  appellant's
    evidence and that of his sister, that he would have no  family  support
    network if he returned to Iraq.   She  invited  me  to  find  that  the
    appellant had lost contact with his mother but that, even if that  were
    not the case, his mother, given her age and circumstances, was not in a
    position to provide support.  She pointed out that, whilst Judge Murray
    had not accepted everything  that  the  appellant  had  said,  she  had
    accepted his underlying claim.  She submitted that  the  appellant  and
    his sister's evidence was consistent  on  a  number  of  aspects.   His
    sister had not changed her evidence on whether  the  family  house  had
    been sold, but she had been asked what had happened to the family home,
    the general question, and had only said it has been sold  when  it  was
    specifically put to her that that was  what  the  appellant  had  said.
    There was nothing inconsistent between the appellant and his sister  on
    this issue.

62. Further, as regards the evidence  of  SN  concerning  her  having  lost
    contact with their mother, there was nothing inconsistent in her  email
    (at U10) dating from a period prior to the August 2019 hearing, and her
    oral evidence, that she had lost contact  with  her  mother  two  years
    earlier.  She had simply been saying that it was difficult  to  contact
    her mother in the email which was the case.

63. Ms  Gunn  submitted  that  both  the  appellant  and  his  sister  were
    consistent in stating that they had had no contact with their uncle  in
    Baghdad.

64. Further, in assessing the appellant's evidence, Ms Gunn invited  me  to
    take into account the medical evidence and that it was clearly the case
    that he had trouble answering specific questions.

65. Ms Gunn invited me to find that there was no evidence  to  support  the
    availability of the proceeds of  the  family  house  being  sold  being
    available to support the appellant on return.  Ms Gunn pointed out that
    the appellant's mother was elderly and lived with family  friends.   As
    regards support  from  the  appellant's  sister  in  the  UK,  Ms  Gunn
    submitted that she had given a credible reason why  she  could  not  do
    this.

66. In relation to the appellant being able to work, Ms Gunn submitted that
    the appellant's evidence of his work in the UK was entirely consistent,
    namely that he had volunteered at a  church  and  had  cut  hair.   The
    documentary  evidence  did  not  suggest  that  he   had   professional
    experience as a barber and that was all that the appellant  was  saying
    in his oral evidence.  The documentary evidence was that he was helping
    out, rather than engaged professionally as a barber.   Ms  Gunn  relied
    upon the medical evidence that the appellant would not be able to  work
    in Iraq and would have no support network.

67. Ms Gunn submitted that taking all these matters  into  account  on  the
    'sliding-scale', including the psychiatric evidence that he was  unable
    to cope with day-to-day life, the appellant had established that  there
    would be an Art 15(c) risk to him on return to Kirkuk city.

68. In  relation  to  internal  relocation,  Ms  Gunn  submitted  that  the
    appellant could not reasonably and without undue  harshness  internally
    relocate to Baghdad.  She relied upon para (19) of the headnote in  SMO
    & Others that  those  of  Kurdish  ethnicity  were  likely  to  require
    external support, i.e. a support network of members  of  their  family,
    who would be willing and able to  provide  genuine  support.   Ms  Gunn
    submitted that I should accept the evidence that the appellant  has  no
    contact with his uncle who would be able to provide a  support  network
    for him.

Discussion and Conclusions

69. As I have already said, the appellant's claim  rests  solely  upon  Art
    15(c) of the Qualification Directive.

70. In SMO & Others, the UT recognised that there was no  general  risk  of
    serious  harm  arising  from  indiscriminate  violence  in  the  Kirkuk
    governorate merely by an individual's presence there (see [425(30)].

71. Ms Gunn relied upon the 'sliding-scale' adopted in SMO &  Others  based
    upon the CJEU's decisions in Elgafaji v Staatssecretaris  van  Jutsitie
    (C-465/07) [2009] 2 CMLR 45 at [39] and Diakite v  Commissaire  g�n�ral
    aux r�fugi�s et aux apatrides (C-285/12) [2014] 1  WLR  2477  at  [31].
    The UT said this (at [32]):

         "At [31] the Court [in Diakite] reaffirmed the view it expressed in
         Elgafaji at [39] that Article 15(c) also contains (what  UNHCR  has
         termed) a "sliding scale" such that "the more the applicant is able
         to show that he is  specifically  affected  by  reason  of  factors
         particular to his personal circumstances, the lower  the  level  of
         indiscriminate  violence  required  for  him  to  be  eligible  for
         subsidiary protection."  The Court thereby recognised that a person
         may still be accorded protection even when  the  general  level  of
         violence is not very high if they are able to show that  there  are
         specific reasons, over and above them  being  mere  civilians,  for
         being affected by the indiscriminate violence.   In  this  way  the
         Article 15(c) inquiry is two-pronged: (a) it asks whether the level
         of violence is so  high  that  there  is  a  general  risk  to  all
         civilians; (b) it asks that even if there is  not  such  a  general
         risk, there  is  a  specific  risk  based  on  the  "sliding-scale"
         notion."


72. The UT went on in [250(32)] to identify the 'sliding-scale'  assessment
    as follows:

         "The situation in the Formerly Contested Areas (the governorates of
         Anbar, Diyala,  Kirkuk,  Ninewah  and  Salah  Al-Din)  is  complex,
         encompassing ethnic, political and humanitarian issues which differ
         by region.  Whether the return of an individual  to  such  an  area
         would be contrary  to  Article  15(c)  requires  a  fact-sensitive,
         'sliding-scale' assessment  to  which  the  following  matters  are
         relevant."

73. At [425(33)] and [425(34)] the UT identified the  relevant  matters  or
    personal characteristics  which  were  to  be  taken  into  account  in
    applying the 'sliding-scale' assessment.  The only one relied  upon  in
    this  appeal  was  the  final  bullet  point  in  [425(34)]  which  was
    "individuals with disabilities".

74. The UT explained the basis for this factor in [312] as follows:

         "The inclusion of category (xvi) - persons with disabilities  -  is
         justifiably premised on a section of the EASO Report which  records
         that  there  is  sadly  discrimination,  inadequate  provision   of
         healthcare and a higher  risk  of  violence,  particularly  against
         those with mental illness".

75. Ms Gunn placed reliance upon the EASO Report in her  skeleton  argument
    (at V147 and V148) as follows:

         "Persons  with  disabilities  face  a  wide   array   of   societal
         discrimination. The prevailing perception among the  public  is  to
         treat persons with disabilities as  charity.  According  to  UNAMI,
         persons  with  disabilities  'face  common  experiences  of   often
         multiple, intersecting and aggravated forms of discrimination which
         hinder, prevent or impair their full enjoyment of their rights  and
         their full and equal participation in all aspects of society'. This
         often  leads  to  isolation  of  persons  with   disabilities   and
         exacerbates negative psychological  effects.  Adults  and  children
         with disabilities are at  a  higher  risk  of  violence  than  non-
         disabled, and those with mental  illnesses  could  be  particularly
         vulnerable."

    And:

         "With regard to mental health, it has been reported that there  are
         huge needs and the available  services  do  not  meet  the  demand.
         Challenges to the mental health system in Iraq include the lack  of
         funding  and  infrastructure,  limited  number  of  mental   health
         professionals, location of services, as they are often too far away
         for people to travel, as well as stigma."

76. Ms Gunn also relied upon the Report of the  Special  Rapporteur  noting
    the lack of healthcare particularly in relation to  mental  health  and
    psycho-social support services which were "mostly absent"  and  finally
    the CPIN Report of May 2019  stating  that  there  were  "very  limited
    psycho-social support services"  and  these  were  "mostly  offered  by
    private institutions although at a cost that is  prohibitive  for  most
    families".  The evidence also  shows  that  the  level  of  psychiatric
    support is very low: including only four psychiatrists per one  million
    residents and that a stigma is  associated  with  mental  illness  (see
    Professor Bluth's report at W10 and W12  respectively).   The  position
    would appear to have worsened since the  COVID-19  pandemic  (see  W12)
    and,  in  Professor  Bluth's  opinion,  long-term  treatment  for   the
    appellant is "highly unlikely" (see W19).

77. I did not  understand  Mr  Howells  to  dispute  the  medical  evidence
    concerning the appellant's mental health.  Dr Battersby's report, which
    I accept, is helpful in this regard.  She diagnoses  the  appellant  as
    suffering from moderate PTSD and  moderate  depressive  disorder.   She
    reports that he is receiving antidepressants and  that  his  treatment,
    together with other therapies, should continue,  indeed  antidepressant
    treatment should increase.   She  notes  that  the  appellant's  mental
    health is "currently poor despite having a lot of support  in  the  UK"
    (see U42).  She points out that  he  has  difficulties  coping  and  is
    "relatively poorly just in terms of basic everyday functioning  in  the
    UK" (see U42).  She comments that on being returned to Iraq, given  his
    PTSD, that is likely to have a  "significant  negative  impact  on  his
    mental health and highly likely to significantly increase the  severity
    of his disorder" (see U43).  It must, of course, be borne in mind  that
    although Judge Murray did not  accept  that  the  appellant  was  being
    targeted by terrorists, his father  was  killed  by  terrorists  either
    because he was targeted or an  innocent  bystander  and  the  appellant
    witnessed  those  events.   There  is  no  reason  to  disbelieve   the
    appellant's subjective fear, perhaps supported  by  his  PTSD,  arising
    from that very real event which happened to him in Iraq.  He would,  of
    course, be returning to Kirkuk  City  -  the  place  where  that  event
    occurred.  Dr Battersby notes (at U36) that the appellant

         "struggles with everyday tasks such as self-care, eating, shopping,
         being in busy places, having to leave if a place is busy/noisy.  He
         describes  sleeping  very  poorly   and   looks   exhausted.    His
         concentration is objectively very poor and he struggles  to  answer
         even quite simple questions  e.g.  about  the  rough  ages  of  his
         sister's children".

78. Dr Battersby also notes that his prognosis for "further improvement  is
    poor" because of the persistence of his  disorder  and  any  additional
    stresses "would be likely to increase the  severity  of  his  symptoms"
    (see U36).  My own assessment of the appellant  whilst  he  was  giving
    evidence was that, entirely genuinely, he was unable to  fully  address
    questions precisely the way Dr Battersby comments in her report.

79. Ms Gunn invited me to accept the appellant's evidence, and that of  his
    sister, that they have lost contact with their mother in  Kirkuk  City.
    I accept that evidence.  The appellant's evidence was  consistent  that
    he had lost contact with his mother and that was also the oral evidence
    of  the  appellant's  sister.   I  do  not  read  the  email  from  the
    appellant's sister, written before the August 2019 hearing,  so  as  to
    undermine the genuineness of her evidence.  Whilst it is true that  she
    does not say that she has lost contact with her mother, she  identifies
    the very factors which, in her oral evidence,  supported  her  evidence
    that she had lost contact with her mother.   Those  were  that  it  was
    difficult to contact her because she did not answer her phone or it did
    not ring.

80. I  accept  Ms  Gunn's  submissions  that  their  evidence  was  largely
    internally consistent and consistent between them in relation  to  such
    matters as what, if any, contact  they  continue  to  have  with  their
    mother or their uncle in Iraq.

81. I do not accept Mr Howells' submission that it was "most unlikely" that
    the appellant would lose contact with his uncle simply because  he  had
    been able to pay for his trip to the UK.  That was, after  all,  twelve
    years ago in any event.

82. I accept Ms Gunn's submission that the  appellant's  sister's  evidence
    concerning whether the family home was sold  in  Kirkuk  city  was,  in
    itself, suspicious and from which I  should  infer  that  she  was  not
    telling me the truth.   It  was,  after  all,  always  the  appellant's
    evidence that the house had been sold.  Having heard  his  sister  give
    evidence, I am satisfied that although she did not  initially  say  the
    house had been sold, when the question was clarified for  her  (on  the
    basis of what the appellant had said) she answered that the  house  had
    been sold.  At least, that is the thrust of her evidence.  It is, as Mr
    Howells accepted, at least plausible that the appellant's mother  would
    not live alone in Kirkuk city after  the  death  of  her  husband  (the
    appellant's father) and that it is entirely plausible  that  she  would
    leave the family home and, as both the appellant and his sister say  in
    evidence, go to live with a friend in Kirkuk city.

83. I also accept the evidence of the appellant's sister that she  provides
    some financial support for the appellant in the UK and, on the basis of
    her oral evidence, that at present she does  not  know  how  she  would
    provide that support if he returned to Iraq.  However, it may  well  be
    that faced with the reality of the appellant in Iraq,  the  appellant's
    sister would find  the  means  (for  example,  through  money  transfer
    agencies) to support him in Iraq at least to the same extent  that  she
    provides financial support in the UK.

84. As regards the appellant's ability  to  work,  I  accept  his  evidence
    (which is not inconsistent with what was said  in  the  letters  relied
    upon by Mr Howells) that he has voluntarily worked as a barber  in  the
    UK and, of course, he worked with his father who was a chef  in  Kirkuk
    before his father was killed.  However, the appellant's ability to work
    will, in my judgment, be affected by his mental health problems.  As Dr
    Battersby recognises in her evidence, the  appellant  has  problems  in
    this country of coping with everyday tasks which  would  include  work.
    Working to support himself is not the same as  the  voluntary  work  he
    provides at his church.  As she notes, the appellant's mental health is
    likely to decline (rather than get better) in Iraq  and  so  the  issue
    will only become more problematic.

85. I accept the evidence, such that it is before me, that  there  is  very
    limited treatment available for mental health in Iraq.  I have  set  it
    out above.  Mr Howells accepted it was limited but not that there was a
    complete absence.  The evidence is that facilities  and  personnel  are
    very thin on the ground indeed.  Professor Bluth's  evidence  was  that
    there are only currently "four psychiatrists per a  million  residents"
    (see W10).  Further, "even fewer people  are  trained  in  the  related
    mental health professions  including  psychological  counselling"  (see
    W10).  The evidence of Dr Battersby is that the appellant requires both
    treatment and therapy or counselling.  I accept that  evidence  despite
    the fact  that  the  appellant's  therapy  and  counselling,  which  he
    previously received in the UK, has currently ceased.

86. Therefore, applying the 'sliding-scale' assessment I make the following
    findings.

87. I accept that there is some evidence postdating SMO & Others concerning
    an increased level of indiscriminate violence  in  Iraq,  including  in
    Kirkuk (see paras 53-55 above).  I note the evidence of Professor Bluth
    and the background evidence relied upon by Ms Gunn at paras 49  and  50
    of her skeleton argument.  It may well be that it is an  over-statement
    for Professor Bluth to say that "violence in Kirkuk is endemic".   That
    was certainly not the view of the Upper Tribunal in SMO & Others at the
    end of 2019.  The up-to-date evidence identifies that ISIS caused  "292
    incidents" across a number of governorates in Iraq.   The  Middle  East
    Institute Report refers to an increase by ISIS of armed  activities  by
    at least 69 percent in April 2020 or  171  attacks.   That  appears  to
    relate to the whole of Iraq.  The  report  also  refers  to  "increased
    attacks in Kirkuk (by as much as 200 percent)".  I did  not  understand
    Ms Gunn to suggest that this evidence would entitle me to  depart  from
    SMO & Others as to the general risk to civilians per se.  In itself, it
    comes nowhere close to providing  "very  strong  grounds  supported  by
    cogent evidence" (see SG (Iraq) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ  940  at  [47]).
    There is, in my judgment, no Art  15(c)  in  general  to  civilians  in
    Kirkuk City.

88. I have, however, to take into account the appellant's relevant personal
    characteristics relied upon.

89. I carry forward  my  findings  above  based  on  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant and SN, the expert reports and the background  documents.   I
    accept that the appellant suffers from mental health problems including
    PTSD and  depressive  disorder  of  moderate  severity.   I  accept  Dr
    Battersby's opinion that the appellant requires medication in the  form
    of antidepressants and therapy and  counselling.   I  also  accept  her
    evidence that, even in the UK, he is unable to cope with basic everyday
    functioning.  I accept her opinion that  his  condition  is  likely  to
    deteriorate in Iraq when he will not have the  support  of  his  sister
    and, of course, he will return to the place where the attack and  death
    of his father (which he witnessed) occurred.   Further,  I  accept  the
    evidence of the appellant and, indeed, his sister that they  have  lost
    contact with their mother.  I accept that she has left the family home,
    probably having sold it, and moved to a friend's home in  Kirkuk  city.
    I do not accept, however, that on return the  appellant  would  not  be
    able to reconnect with his mother.  His sister knows the  name  of  the
    friend and, it is at least possible, that the appellant would  be  able
    to find his mother in Kirkuk City.  However, even if he  were  to  find
    her, I accept that he would not have living accommodation with her,  as
    the family home has probably been sold, and as regards support  she  is
    herself elderly and is likely to be unable to give sustained  emotional
    and other support that the appellant requires given his  mental  health
    problems in particular.  I accept that the  appellant  will  have  real
    difficulties in financially supporting himself in Kirkuk City  because,
    despite his skills as a barber or chef (both of which he has done), his
    mental  health  problems,  deteriorating  as  they  would  do   in   Dr
    Battersby's opinion, will make it unlikely that he could hold down  any
    work.  However, I do accept that the appellant's  sister  would  likely
    find the means to send some financial support to him as she provides to
    him in the UK.  Although she may not know how to  do  that  now,  I  am
    satisfied she would be able to find the mechanism for sending money  to
    Iraq if he were to return.

90. I bear in mind what was said by the Upper Tribunal in SMO &  Others  at
    [312],  referring  to  the  EASO   Report,   that   there   is   "sadly
    discrimination, inadequate provision of healthcare and a higher risk of
    violence, particularly against those with mental illness".  That is, in
    my judgment, the position in which the appellant would find himself  in
    Kirkuk City if he returned there and  even  if  he  was  able  to  make
    contact with his mother.  The limited  availability  of  treatment  and
    therapy for his mental health condition is  likely  to  exacerbate  his
    PTSD and depressive disorder from which he suffers in the  UK.   In  my
    judgment, his mental illness is likely to lead to  discrimination  and,
    as the Upper Tribunal accepted on the basis of the evidence,  a  higher
    risk of violence towards him.

91. Taking those matters into account together, there is an increased  risk
    of the appellant being targeted because of his condition.

92.  Applying  the  'sliding-scale',  having  regard  to  the   appellant's
    circumstances in Kirkuk City, the implications for his mental health on
    return and the problems he would face in supporting  and  accommodating
    himself (even if his mother can be traced and some money send from  the
    UK by his sister), I am satisfied that the appellant has established  a
    real risk of serious harm contrary to Art 15(c) on his return to Kirkuk
    City.

93. That then leaves the issue of whether the  appellant  could  internally
    relocate to Baghdad.  At [425(48)], the UT in SMO & Others said this in
    relation to relocation to Baghdad:

         "Relocation to Baghdad.  Baghdad is  generally  safe  for  ordinary
         civilians but whether it is safe for a  particular  returnee  is  a
         question of fact in the individual case.   There  are  no  on-entry
         sponsorship requirements for  Baghdad  but  there  are  sponsorship
         requirements for residency.  A documented individual of working age
         is likely to be able to satisfy those requirements.  Relocation  to
         Baghdad is likely to be reasonable for Arab Shia and Sunni  single,
         able-bodied men and married couples of working age without children
         and without specific vulnerabilities.  Other individuals are likely
         to require external support, ie a support network of members of his
         or her family, extended family or tribe, who are willing  and  able
         to provide genuine support.  Whether  such  a  support  network  is
         available is to be considered with reference  to  the  collectivist
         nature of Iraqi society, as considered in AAH (Iraq)."

94. The appellant, of course, will continue to suffer  from  mental  health
    difficulties. Again, I carry forward my earlier findings in relation to
    the appellant's mental health and  other  personal  circumstances.   He
    will be a single non-Arab of Kurdish ethnicity in  Baghdad.   I  accept
    that  he  does  speak  some  Arabic  which  will  be   of   assistance.
    Nevertheless, his ability to support himself, given his  mental  health
    problems, remains a problem having regard to Dr Battersby's  view  that
    his mental health creates problems for him dealing with everyday  tasks
    in the UK and that that situation can only become worse on return.   He
    is, in my judgment, a person  who  has  "specific  vulnerabilities"  on
    return.  In my judgment, he will have no family support in Baghdad.   I
    accept his evidence and that of  his  sister  -  which  was  consistent
    throughout  on  this  issue  -  that  neither  has  contact  with   the
    appellant's maternal uncle in Baghdad.  The appellant said he  has  had
    no contact since he came to the UK twelve years ago and his sister  has
    had no contact since she came to the UK in 2004.  I find that there  is
    likely that he lost contact with, and will not be able  to  contact  on
    return, his uncle in Baghdad.  Financial support from  the  appellant's
    sister will, of course, provide some  material  support.   However,  he
    will be without any emotional or other social support in Baghdad, given
    his vulnerabilities and what is said in [425(48)] of SMO & Others, I am
    satisfied that it would be unreasonable or  unduly  harsh  for  him  to
    relocate and live in Baghdad.

95. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the appellant has established  a
    real risk of serious harm contrary  to  Art  15(c)  in  his  home  area
    (namely Kirkuk City) and that it would not be reasonable (and would  be
    unduly harsh) for him internally to relocate to Baghdad.  The appellant
    has established that his return to Iraq would breach Art 15(c)  of  the
    Qualification  Directive  and  that  he  is  entitled  to  humanitarian
    protection.

Decision

96. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under Art 15(c)  was  set  aside  by  my  decision  sent  on  13
    September 2019.

97. I re-make the decision allowing the appellant's appeal under Art  15(c)
    of the Qualification Directive.

98. Judge Murray's decision to dismiss the  appellant's  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds stands.

99. No reliance was placed upon Art 8.
