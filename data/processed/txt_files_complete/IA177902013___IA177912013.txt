For the Appellants:    Mr Z Jafferji, of Counsel instructed by Fitzpatrick
ad Co.
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The first appellant is a citizen of Germany born on 6 March 1967.   The
    second appellant is his wife, a citizen of  Nigeria  born  on  6  April
    1979.  They appeal against  a  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Nightingale who in a  determination  dated  24  February  2014
    dismissed their appeals against a decision of the Secretary of State to
    refuse to issue them with  a  permanent  registration  certificate  and
    permanent residence card respectively as persons who had resided in the
    United Kingdom in accordance with  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006 for a continuous period of five years.

2.   The first appellant had claimed that he had  entered  Britain  in  2007
    and had sought work here until 2009 when he became  a  student  between
    2009 and 2011, and that thereafter he had entered self-employment.

3.   The judge considered the evidence and the submissions and,  having  set
    out the applicable law in paragraph 19 gave her findings and reasons in
    paragraph 20 onwards of the determination.  She found that  given  that
    the appellant had been paid jobseeker's allowance  rather  than  income
    support she  was  prepared  to  accept  that  he  might  have  been  in
    employment for a short period of time in Britain and concluded that  it
    was therefore not the case that he had entered Britain in order to seek
    employment as his evidence had  been  that  he  had  come  to  take  up
    employment.  However, no evidence of the employment had  been  produced
    and "since the appellant was not entirely clear how long,  exactly,  he
    had worked for," the judge said that she could not find that the period
    in question had been established on balance to be a period during which
    he had exercised Treaty rights as a worker.  She said that taken at its
    highest the appellant might have  worked  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    exercised Treaty rights as a worker but he had not established  on  the
    evidence before her on balance that he had done so.

4.   In paragraph 21 she went on to write:-

         "However, if I am to accept that the appellant went from employment
         to involuntary unemployment in 2009, he is not, in the  definitions
         found within the Regulations, to be regarded as a jobseeker  during
         this period  of  time,  but  must  make  out  the  requirements  of
         Regulation 6(2).  I accept that the first  appellant  was  in  duly
         recorded involuntary  unemployment  for  a  two  year  period  and,
         indeed, that he had registered as a  jobseeker  with  the  relevant
         employment office.  However, he has not  established  that  he  was
         employed for one year or more before becoming unemployed.  Also, it
         appears that he was unemployed for more than six months  since  his
         claim, in fact, relates to a two year period.  There is no evidence
         that during this period of unemployment he had a genuine chance  of
         being engaged.  Given that he was  unemployed  for  two  years  and
         then, subsequently, entered education for two years realising  that
         he needed further qualifications in order to secure  some  kind  of
         employment, the evidence points in the other  direction.   Even  if
         this period should, in fact, be treated as a period during which he
         was a jobseeker, I cannot find that the definition of  a  qualified
         person found at Regulation 6(4) is made out on the evidence  before
         me.  Even following two years unemployment, and two  year  back  at
         college, it appears that he was not able to secure employment  and,
         in fact, had to start his own business in order  to  try  and  earn
         some income.  I cannot, therefore, find that the two years that the
         appellant spent as a  Jobseeker's  Allowance  claimant  amounts  to
         qualifying activity under Regulation 6(2)(b) or 6(4).  I  therefore
         find that the first period for which qualifying residence has  been
         established is, in fact, his time at the  University  of  Greenwich
         which, I accept , does amount to a period of study."


    Turning to the period  between 2009 and 2011 the judge  stated that she
    did not find on balance that  the  lack  of  private  arrangements  for
    sickness cover rendered the appellant's  period  of  residence  between
    2009 and 2011, not in accordance with the Regulations and she  accepted
    that  the  appellant  had  been  a  student  in  accordance  with   the
    Regulations during that period.

5.   The judge then turned to the appellant's claim that he had set  up  his
    own business some time around August or  September  2011  but  had  not
    started trading until the end of December 2011.  She stated  there  was
    no indication of what he had been doing between July and December  2011
    other than taking steps to register  a  business  by  way  of  economic
    activity or any other  qualifying  activity.   She  stated  that  there
    appeared to be a period of around five months when the first  appellant
    was not exercising any kind of Treaty rights at all.

6.   The judge then considered the evidence  that  had  been  produced  with
    regard to the self-employment.  She noted that two tax returns had been
    made but stated:-

         "There is not one  invoice,  letter,  bank  statement,  or  indeed,
         anything else which established  that  his  business  is  genuinely
         trading.  There  are  no  letters  from  his  clients  or,  indeed,
         anything other than the mere fact of his NI  registration  and  the
         two tax returns.  There is nothing shown in the bank statements  of
         the first appellant referred to  as  being  a  result  of  business
         income.  The majority of the payments into the bank account  appear
         to emanate, in fact, from the second appellant.  There  are  other,
         unspecified, payments into his bank account, but there  is  nothing
         to link these with business activity."

7.   At paragraphs 25 onwards the judge set out her conclusions as follows:-



         "25. I therefore considered the evidence before me  in  the  round.
             The first appellant is registered as  self-employed,  and  has
             made two tax returns in the sum of around ï¿½3,000 per year.  He
             has  made,  and  continues   to   make,   national   insurance
             contributions as a self-employed person.  Taking the  evidence
             before me at the highest, I find it had been established  that
             the first appellant might be doing  some  self-employed  work,
             but  it  has  not  been  established   on   the   balance   of
             probabilities that he  is,  in  fact,  self-employed  for  the
             purposes  of   Regulation   6   of   the   2006   Regulations.
             Consequently, I do not find that it has  been  established  on
             balance  that  he  has  completed  two  years'  residence   in
             accordance with the EEA Regulations 2006  as  a  self-employed
             individual.


         26.  I find that it has not been established on  balance  that  the
             appellants have resided in the United  Kingdom  in  accordance
             with the Regulations for a continuous period  of  five  years.
             The appeals must, therefore, fail on this basis.   It  is,  of
             course, open to the appellants to  make  a  fresh  application
             with the appropriate documentary evidence to  establish  their
             claimed rights.  However, on the evidence which is  before  me
             they  have  not  discharged   the   burden   of   proof   and,
             consequently, these appeals must fail.


         27.  These appeals are against the decision of  the  respondent  to
             refuse to issue permanent residence cards to  the  appellants.
             There is no removal decision and, also, no Section 120  notice
             has been served.  (Schedule 1, regulation 20(4)(8) applies  to
             the issuing of section 120 notice in an EEA appeal.)  There is
             presently no requirement for  the  appellants  to  depart  the
             United Kingdom as a result of the refusal to issue  them  with
             permanent residence cards.   Following  the  decision  of  the
             Court of Appeal in Lamichhane, only the subject matter of  the
             decision appealed is, therefore justiciable in the absence  of
             a  Section  120  notice.   Article  8   is   not,   therefore,
             considered."

8.   The Appellant appealed arguing that the judge had failed to  deal  with
    a ground of appeal which argued that even if  the  appellants  did  not
    qualify for permanent residence they ought to be granted a further five
    years residence card.  The grounds asserted that in  paragraph  25  the
    judge had accepted that the first appellant had been exercising  Treaty
    rights as a self-employed person from 2011 to date.  They  also  argued
    that the judge had erred in her consideration of  whether  or  not  the
    appellant was a jobseeker and saying that there was lack of  sufficient
    credibility findings in respect of the oral testimony.  Proper  reasons
    had not been given.  The third ground of appeal argued  that  the  five
    year period ought to have been considered from the date of  the  appeal
    hearing, that is from 2014 back to 2009.

9.   Although permission to appeal was refused on  those  grounds  asserting
    that the judge should have considered the five years back from the date
    of hearing under the provisions of Section 85(4) of the 2002 Act  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Taylor stated that there was merit in the  argument  the
    judge had erred in failing to determine a ground of appeal (I  consider
    that she  was  referring  to  the  First-tier  Judge  who  had  refused
    permission) and stated that all grounds could be argued.

10.  At the hearing of the appeal before me  Mr  Jaffarji  argued  that  the
    primary ground on which he wished to rely was that the  judge  had  not
    determined the issue of whether or not the first appellant was entitled
    to residence in any event even if he  did  not  qualify  for  permanent
    residence.  While he accepted that that application had not  been  made
    he stated that it was for the judge to have determined whether  or  not
    the first appellant was self-employed but in any event as his  children
    were EU nationals he and his wife would have a right  of  residence  in
    any  event.   In  support  of  that  argument  he   referred   to   the
    determination of the Tribunal in MDB & Others (Article  12,  16  12/68)
    Italy [2010] UKUT 161 (IAC) although he did not put  the  determination
    before me.  He stated that that determination meant that any rights  of
    the appellant should be  considered  when  leave  was  refused  and  he
    referred to Section 109(iii) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002 which stated that the Regulations could make provision for  an
    appeal against an immigration decision taken in respect of a person who
    has or claims to have a right under any of the Community  treaties  and
    that immigration decision was defined  as  a  person's  entitlement  to
    enter or remain in the United Kingdom or their removal from the  United
    Kingdom.

11.  Mr Jaffarji went on to state that the judge had erred in not  accepting
    that  the  appellant  had  exercised  Treaty  rights  for  five  years.
    Moreover he stated that as the appellants had children here who were in
    education they were on that basis alone entitled to remain.

12.  In reply Mr Melvin pointed out that he had not been served with a  copy
    of MDB and so therefore could not comment thereon but in any  event  he
    asked me  to  accept  there  was  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination.  The judge had been entitled to find that the  appellant
    had not been exercising Treaty rights here at any  time  and  therefore
    the other points fell away.  The judge was correct not to be  satisfied
    that the appellant had worked in 2007 and  there  was  nothing  in  the
    appellant's evidence to show that he had ever been  self-sufficient  or
    that he had started a business which was genuinely trading.

13.  He emphasised that it had never been argued that because the  appellant
    had children in education here the appellants were entitled to right to
    remain.

14.  In reply Mr Jaffarji stated that it was evident from  paragraph  25  of
    the determination the judge had accepted that when the first  appellant
    had entered Britain he had entered as a  worker  and  that  this  would
    impact on the rights of the appellants to  remain  as  the  parents  of
    children in education.  They had a right  to  remain  as  long  as  the
    children attended school.  Moreover he emphasised  that  there  was  an
    error in regard to the extended right of residence.

Discussion

15.  The appellants applied  for  documentation  to  show   that  they  were
    entitled to permanent residence here.  The decision was made to  refuse
    that and the grounds of appeal  before  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal dealt solely with that point.  The grounds  merely assert that
    the appellant was a jobseeker between 2007 and 2009, a student for  the
    following two years and a self-employed person thereafter.

16.  That was the issue that was considered by the Judge.

17.  Although I consider that the judge's conclusions in paragraph  25  were
    somewhat unclear regarding  whether  or  not  the  appellant  had  been
    exercising Treaty rights until 2007 as a jobseeker it appears to be the
    case that the  judge  found  that  the  appellant  was  not.   Moreover
    although the judge accepted that  the  first  appellant  had  exercised
    Treaty rights as a student between 2009 and  2011  the  judge  did  not
    accept  that  the  first  appellant  was   exercising   Treaty   rights
    thereafter.

18.  The judge's findings of fact on  those  issues  were  unequivocal.   In
    effect the judge found that the first appellant had not been exercising
    Treaty rights since the end of his studies in  2011.   That  being  the
    case the judge was entitled to find that the first  appellant  was  not
    entitled to permanent residence in Britain  nor  the  second  appellant
    entitled to the appropriate residence card.

19.  The grounds of appeal raised a matter  not  before  the  judge  in  the
    First-tier - and therefore it is arguable that it was not an  error  of
    law for the judge not to have dealt with it but that issue was  whether
    or not the appellant was entitled to a right of residence in any event.
     Given the  judge's  findings  of  fact  that  the  appellant  was  not
    exercising Treaty rights because he was not working as a  self-employed
    person in the period after his studies here the judge  could  not  have
    found that the appellant was therefore entitled to  a  residence  card.
    The reality is that the first appellant did not, at the date of hearing
    nor indeed at the date of application nor date of decision qualify  for
    a residence card as it had not been accepted  that  he  was  exercising
    Treaty rights in Britain.  Therefore although that might well have been
    an issue on which the judge should have adjudicated the only conclusion
    could have been that the appellants were not so entitled.

20.  Similarly with regard to the position of the appellants as the  parents
    of EU nationals who were studying here the reality is that there was no
    evidence placed before the judge or indeed  before  me  that  when  the
    appellant's children were in education here  the  first  appellant  was
    exercising Treaty rights.

21.  For these reasons I consider that the decision of the judge to  dismiss
    this appeal on immigration grounds  shall  stand  and  the  appellants'
    appeals are hereby dismissed.
