Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
An anonymity order was not made by the First-tier  Tribunal.   No  anonymity
order  was  sought  by  the  Appellant.   However,  this  decision  contains
sensitive,  detailed  information  about  the  medical  condition   of   the
Appellant's partner and  identification  of  the  Appellant  could  lead  to
identification of his partner.   For  that  reason,  I  have  considered  it
appropriate to make an anonymity order of my own motion.  Unless  and  until
a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the Appellant is  granted  anonymity.
No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or
any member of his family. This direction applies, amongst  others,  to  both
parties. Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt  of
court proceedings.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND

    1. By a decision promulgated on 15 February 2019, I found an  error  of
       law in the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  NMK  Lawrence
       promulgated on 4 October 2018.  I therefore set aside that decision.
        There were two appeals before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   In
       relation to the first, an appeal  under  the  Immigration  (European
       Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA appeal"),  I  re-made  the
       decision in the Appellant's favour.  I will need to return  to  that
       below.

    2. In relation to the second, I  found  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge had erred in his conclusion that there  was  no  valid  appeal
       before him.  I therefore  gave  directions  for  a  resumed  hearing
       before me in order to determine the appeal. This appeal is therefore
       against the Respondent's decision dated 28 June  2018  refusing  the
       Appellant's human rights claim and application for leave  to  remain
       as the husband of a British citizen.

    3. In relation to the EEA appeal, the Respondent was the losing  party.
       The Respondent sought permission to appeal my decision  in  the  EEA
       appeal which application I refused on 18 March 2019.  The Respondent
       has renewed that application to the Court of Appeal.

    4. On 29 March 2019, the Appellant  requested  an  adjournment  of  the
       hearing in this appeal.  He  did  so  on  the  basis  that,  if  the
       Respondent's application for permission to appeal my decision in the
       EEA appeal fails,  this  appeal  would  be  academic  and  would  be
       withdrawn.   It  could  not  be   withdrawn   however   whilst   the
       Respondent's application was ongoing.  Furthermore, the letter  drew
       attention to the Appellant's  intention  to  apply  for  pre-settled
       status under Appendix EU to  the  Immigration  Rules  ("the  Rules")
       which was expected to be fully in force from  30  March  2019.   The
       Appellant, as the family member  of  a  qualifying  British  citizen
       under that appendix, would be entitled to make an application  which
       would be likely to succeed.  Once again, it was pointed out that, if
       the Appellant obtained recognition of his status in that  way,  this
       appeal would become academic.

    5. I refused the adjournment by decision dated 5 April 2019.  A copy of
       that decision is annexed hereto for ease of reference.  I did so  on
       the basis that it was not clear at that stage whether the Respondent
       intended to seek permission to appeal my decision in the EEA  appeal
       and  the  application  was  therefore   premature.    Further,   the
       application under Appendix EU would be a "new matter" and could have
       no relevance to this appeal, not least because  the  Respondent  has
       yet to make a decision on any such application.

    6. At the outset of the  hearing  before  me,  Mr  Berry  repeated  the
       Appellant's application for an adjournment  on  the  same  basis  as
       previously  but  relying  on  the  updated  information   that   the
       Respondent has now renewed his application for permission to  appeal
       my decision in the  EEA  appeal.   He  also  informed  me  that  the
       Appellant could not yet make the application under  Appendix  EU  as
       the necessary forms are not yet  available.   Although  he  accepted
       that this would be a new matter and not directly  relevant  to  this
       appeal, he said that the Appellant's entitlement to rely on  EU  law
       rights (which remains disputed by the Respondent) is relevant to the
       Article 8 ECHR issues at play in this appeal.   The  Appellant  says
       that he is lawfully entitled to be in the UK in reliance on  his  EU
       law rights.  He may not be entitled to rely on those rights directly
       when the case is considered under Appendix FM to the Rules  but  his
       entitlement to reside in the UK is relevant to Article 8  ECHR  when
       that is considered outside the Rules and particularly in relation to
       the Respondent's case that  the  Appellant  and  his  husband  could
       return to Spain together in order for the Appellant  to  seek  entry
       clearance or the Appellant could return to  Pakistan  for  the  same
       purpose.    The  application  for  an  adjournment  was  made  on  a
       pragmatic basis to avoid the waste of the Tribunal's time.

    7. Whilst the Appellant's desire to avoid wasting the  Tribunal's  time
       is to be commended, I indicated to  Mr  Berry  that  I  intended  to
       refuse the adjournment because I could not understand how  it  could
       be said to be in the Appellant's or his husband's interests  to  put
       the appeal off to another day.  The Respondent is unlikely  to  give
       the Appellant a residence permit until the Respondent's  application
       to the Court of Appeal is resolved.  That could take some time.  The
       timing of an application under Appendix EU  is  similarly  uncertain
       whereas, if I were to decide this appeal in the  Appellant's  favour
       it may give him a swifter resolution of his right to remain  in  the
       UK.  I therefore refused the adjournment and the hearing proceeded.

    ISSUES

    8. The Respondent does not take  issue  with  the  genuineness  of  the
       Appellant's relationship with his British citizen husband, [PN].  It
       was also common ground before me that the minimum  income  threshold
       under Appendix FM to the Rules does not apply  because  [PN]  is  in
       receipt of disability benefits.  It was  accepted  though  that  the
       Appellant cannot meet the eligibility requirements of Appendix FM to
       the Rules because of his  immigration  status.   Although  Mr  Tufan
       submitted that there was an insufficiency of documentary evidence to
       meet Appendix FM-SE to the Rules (so that the  Appellant  could  not
       succeed on the five-year' route), the issue between the parties is a
       narrow  one  in  relation  to  the  eligibility  requirements  under
       Appendix FM, namely whether paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM is met.
        That turns on  whether  there  are  "insurmountable  obstacles"  to
       family life between the Appellant and [PN]  continuing  outside  the
       UK.  That in turn focusses  on  whether  they  could  continue  that
       family life in Spain where they lived previously, it being  accepted
       that, as a gay couple, they could not continue that family  life  in
       Pakistan.

    9. Outside the Rules, the Respondent's position is that  the  Appellant
       could return to Pakistan and obtain entry  clearance  to  return  as
       [PN]'s husband and that it would not be disproportionate for him  to
       do so.  Similarly, the Appellant and [PN] could return to Spain  and
       obtain entry clearance for the Appellant from there.

    EVIDENCE

   10. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant  and  [PN].   I  also  have
       before me a bundle of documentary evidence  from  the  Appellant  to
       which I refer below as [AB/xx].  Mr Berry also handed in  a  medical
       report  dated  4  September  2018  in  relation  to  [PN]'s  medical
       condition which had been omitted from the bundle.  Mr Tufan did  not
       object to the admission of that evidence.

    The Appellant's Evidence

   11. The Appellant has provided a written  statement  dated  4  September
       2018 ([AB/3-8].  He adopted that statement in evidence.

   12. The Appellant met [PN] in January 2015 through an online website for
       gay men.  They met up in China where the Appellant was  studying  at
       that time.  After he completed his degree, the  Appellant  moved  to
       Spain where [PN] was then living.  They married  there  on  22  July
       2016.  The Appellant came to the UK with [PN] on  15  January  2017,
       but they did not remain long  term  and  returned  to  Spain.   [PN]
       returned to the UK in  about  April  or  May  2017.   The  Appellant
       arrived here to join him on 9 May 2017.

   13. [PN] has various medical complaints which I set out in  more  detail
       below.  He attended the  hearing  in  a  wheelchair.  The  Appellant
       provides [PN] with emotional and physical support.  He also supports
       the couple financially because he has found work in the housekeeping
       department of a hotel in Chelsea and [PN] is  unable  to  work.   In
       terms of caring for [PN], the Appellant prepares food and  medicines
       for him before the Appellant goes to work.  He also helps [PN]  with
       showering.  When the Appellant is not working, he  takes  [PN]  out.
       The Appellant also accompanies [PN]  to  medical  appointments.   He
       checks on [PN] regularly throughout the day by phone  and,  if  [PN]
       does not answer, he goes  straight  home  to  ensure  that  [PN]  is
       alright.

   14. When asked about obstacles to their family life continuing in Spain,
       the Appellant said that they could not do  so  due  to  [PN]'s  ill-
       health.  Although those problems existed when the  couple  lived  in
       Spain, the problems had got worse. Although healthcare was available
       in Spain it was not to the same standard as in the UK.  In Spain,  a
       doctor would attend, prescribe medication and then leave.  [PN]  was
       now receiving appropriate care.  The Appellant was  also  unable  to
       find work in Spain and, since [PN] was unable to  work,  the  couple
       were  struggling  financially.   The  Appellant  confirmed  that  he
       continues to hold a residence card as  [PN]'s  family  member  which
       would allow him to work in Spain.  That expires in 2021.

   15. When asked why he  could  not  return  to  Pakistan  to  seek  entry
       clearance as [PN]'s spouse under the Rules, the Appellant said  that
       he could not leave [PN] even for one day.  Amongst other conditions,
       [PN] has type 1 diabetes.  He is prone to having "hypo" attacks  and
       if the Appellant were not there to check on him, [PN] could go  into
       a coma.   The  Appellant  also  thought  that,  if  he  returned  to
       Pakistan, his family  in  Pakistan  might  try  to  force  him  into
       marriage with a girl which he did not want.

    [PN]'s Evidence

   16. [PN] has provided a written statement dated 4 September 2018 ([AB/9-
       12]).  He adopted that statement in evidence.

   17. Before he met the Appellant, [PN] had been married to a  woman  when
       he was young, but they were divorced.  He then had a long-term  male
       partner for twelve years, but  he  had  died.   [PN]  confirmed  the
       circumstances in which the Appellant says they met (see above).

   18. [PN] went to Spain to live in  1995.   He  had  permanent  residence
       there.  He left Spain in either April or May 2017.  He was unable to
       recall the precise date.  [PN] confirmed that he could probably have
       applied for citizenship in Spain but had not done so.  He  continues
       to own a property in Spain which he is  renting  out  subject  to  a
       twelve months' lease.

   19. Rather than summarising [PN]'s medical complaints, I refer  to  what
       he says in his statement about those as follows:


           "[7]  We [he and the  Appellant]  were  happy  together  but  my
           health was starting to deteriorate in Spain.  Not only had I had
           a heart attack, but I was having  increasing  problems  with  my
           feet.  This had been going on for the last six years.  I had  to
           stop work in 2012 because I could no longer drive anymore and  I
           worked in the car business.
           [8]   My family (two brothers and sister) were urging me to come
           home because of my failing health.   It  was  clear  I  was  not
           getting the treatment I needed and they thought it was essential
           that I came back to the United Kingdom.  I tried to stick it out
           but I eventually realised that they were right and I  needed  to
           come back to the United Kingdom.  Things were going from bad  to
           worse especially with my feet.
           [9]   When I arrived in the United Kingdom, I went  to  see  the
           doctor and was quickly admitted to hospital.  It became clear to
           them that my health was very poor and that action was needed.
           [10]  In May 2018, I had two amputations.  They  also  diagnosed
           me with chronic kidney disease (this had been mentioned in Spain
           but nothing had been done).  They have stated that they are  now
           dealing with my kidneys.
           [11]  In July 2018, I had two  more  amputations  and  had  four
           stents put in my leg.
           [12]  My heart disease continues but is not causing me  any  new
           difficulties at present.
           [13]  I have to continually deal, though, with my  diabetes.   I
           frequently have "hypos" as I call them which is  when  my  blood
           sugar goes very low.
           [14]  Since I have been back to the United Kingdom, I have had I
           think approximately 12 admissions to hospital.   In  fact,  when
           our solicitor kindly agreed to take on our case free to help  us
           in a very difficult time, he had  to  come  and  see  me  in  St
           Thomas' Hospital because I was there at the time."

       [PN] confirmed in  oral  evidence  that  his  medical  treatment  is
       ongoing.  He is due to have his right foot amputated and is  waiting
       for an appointment letter which he expects soon.

   20. [PN] confirmed the Appellant's evidence  about  what  the  Appellant
       does for him.  Although [PN] has siblings in the UK,  they  live  in
       the West Midlands and have their own families.  He could not  expect
       them to provide the  sort  of  care  which  the  Appellant  provides
       presently.

   21. In his statement, [PN] sets out what he says are  the  obstacles  to
       the couple continuing their family life in Spain as follows:

           "[22] I do not know how we would survive  at  present  in  Spain
           because [IA] does not speak Spanish and has never been  able  to
           find work there despite the fact that we lived  there  for  some
           time.  It would be the same again if we were in Spain.  The most
           important thing, though, is that I need the NHS.  They are doing
           everything they can for me and I am grateful.  I need to  remain
           in the UK for this reason and need [IA] with  me  as  he  is  my
           support.  The health system in Spain could not support me.  When
           I first started to have problems in 2007 related to my diabetes,
           the service was not as good as the UK but it  was  okay.   Since
           then, as the problems with my health mounted,  and  the  service
           has deteriorated and my health  problems  were  not  dealt  with
           properly in Spain.  It is because it became so desperate that we
           came back to the UK, my home country.  As I  explain  above,  as
           soon as I got here the NHS has started to deal  with  my  health
           issues.  The combination of my very poor  health,  the  lack  of
           proper assistance in Spain and [IA]'s inability  to  find  work,
           meant that it is necessary for us to be in the UK."

      Other Evidence

   22. There is no other witness evidence on which  the  Appellant  relies.
       Dealing first with [PN]'s medical condition,  there  are  two  short
       letters in the bundle at [AB/86-87] and [AB/88-89] from  St  Thomas'
       Hospital and [PN]'s GP respectively which  confirm  what  [PN]  says
       about his various medical conditions (see above).   I  have  already
       referred to the further letter admitted in evidence which is written
       by Dr Piya Sen Gupta, Consultant at St Thomas' hospital.  That  sets
       out [PN]'s various medical conditions as follows:


              "  Type 1 diabetes 1974
               . Recurrent hypoglycaemia
               . Ischaemic heart disease with  previous  myocardial  infarct
                 and coronary artery stents 2009
               . Peripheral vascular disease with recurrent foot infections,
                 osteomyelitis:
                          o Right transmetatarsal amputation 2011
                          o Left 5th toe amputation 2015
                          o Left 2nd and 3rd toe  amputation  on  16th  May
                            2018
                          o Non-displaced fracture of left  3rd  metatarsal

                 nephrotic syndrome - Aug 2018 active

                 hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury relating  to  sepsis,

               . Iron deficiency anaemia
               . Previous alcohol excess
               . Smoker."

   23. The letter goes on to refer to the extent  of  the  treatment  which
       [PN] has received since returning to the UK as follows:


           "[PN] has had multiple frequent (generally once to twice a week)
           outpatient visits since April 2017 to the  Diabetes  Centre  for
           foot health reviews.  There have been 70  such  appointments  to
           the  Diabetes  Centre  and  additionally  there  have   been   6
           appointments with  surgical  appliances  for  special  footwear,
           appointments with 5 additional appointments to cardiology, chest
           and endoscopy departments.  He has also had multiple  admissions
           including the following:
               . 18th  to  20th  April  2017  with  a  foot  infection  that
                 responded to antibiotic treatment
               . 13th June 2017 with hypoglycaemia
               . 17th to 18th July 2017 for  angiogram  and  angioplasty  of
                 left leg with stents to the superficial femoral artery  and
                 anterior tibial artery
               .  24th  to  26th  August  2017  with  renal  impairment  and
                 hyperkalaemia
               . 15th to 16th January 2018 with angioplasty to left anterior
                 tibial artery
               . 19th to 20th April 2018 with a foot infection treated  with
                 antibiotics
               . 14th to 25th May 2018 with wet gangrene of  the  left  foot
                 including toe amputations of the left 2nd and 3rd toes
               . 21st June 2018  to  12th  July  2018  it  was  during  this
                 admission that I had met [PN].   I  reviewed  him  on  ward
                 rounds including on 9th July 2018.  He  underwent  2nd  and
                 3rd toe amputation on 1st July 2018.  It  was  also  during
                 this admission I had met [PN]'s partner, [IA]  on  some  of
                 these ward rounds
               . 23rd July to 25th July 2018"

   24. Dr Gupta provides the following summary and prognosis in relation to
       [PN]'s medical condition:


           "Summary
           [PN] is a 61 year old man with  longstanding  diabetes  that  is
           insulin treated  with  a  significant  vascular  disease  burden
           including coronary heart disease and ischaemic heart disease  as
           well  as  the  multiple  co-morbities   listed   with   multiple
           medications  also.    Unstable   glycaemic   control   including
           hypoglycaemia is also an on-going issue.  He has had a difficult
           to  treat  left  foot  infection  requiring  multiple   surgical
           procedures including amputation but his foot and leg continue to
           be at risk given persisting oedema, likely as a result of  renal
           disease but under investigation.  Since 2017, his  mobility  has
           declined.
           He is independent in walking slowly with a stick but this is for
           short  distances.   He  uses  a  wheelchair  outside  his   home
           sometimes.  He reports needing assistance with getting  dressed,
           showered and with cleaning - he is likely to need this given his
           postural hypotension and ongoing foot issues.  He says it is his
           partner [IA] who has been assisting him.
           Management plan:
           He needs continued regular  multidisciplinary  foot  team  input
           including  diabetes  and  podiatry  care  and,  unless  the  leg
           swelling improves, it will be difficult to fully heal  his  left
           foot, which continues to be at risk.  His prognosis is difficult
           to predict but he already has a significant burden  of  vascular
           disease  along  with  longstanding  type  1  diabetes,  unstable
           glycaemic control and renal dysfunction, this will likely impact
           on his overall morbidity  and  mortality,  particularly  in  the
           context of an active and recurrent foot infection."

   25. The Appellant's bundle includes some documentation  in  relation  to
       his and [PN]'s income.  Those  show  that  [PN]  is  in  receipt  of
       �145.35 per week, personal independence payment from 9  April  2018.
       He is also in receipt of �127.15 per week,  employment  and  support
       allowance from 13 April 2018.  The Appellant's P60 for the tax  year
       2017/18 shows that he earned a total of �5084 but it  is  not  clear
       when he began employment in that year.  The most recent payslips  in
       the bundle date from April to July 2018 and show fluctuating  weekly
       earnings ranging from �181.29 to �461.20.

    SUBMISSIONS

   26. Mr Tufan pointed out the high threshold which applies  to  paragraph
       EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  to  the  Rules.   The  term  "insurmountable
       obstacles" is defined at  EX.2  as  meaning  "the  very  significant
       difficulties which would be faced by the applicant or their  partner
       in continuing their family life together outside the  UK  and  which
       could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for  the
       applicant  or  their  partner."   Mr  Tufan   submitted   that   the
       difficulties of the couple  living  in  Spain  as  they  had  before
       returning to the UK were insufficient to reach that threshold.

   27. Outside the Rules, Mr Tufan drew attention to what was said  by  the
       Supreme  Court  in  Agyarko  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department [2017] UKSC 11 about the test to be met in order to  show
       that removal would be disproportionate.  The impact  on  a  person's
       family life must be unjustifiably harsh.  Again, he  submitted  that
       the evidence did not show that this test was met.

   28. Mr Tufan also submitted that the  Appellant  could  be  expected  to
       return Pakistan  in  order  to  obtain  entry  clearance  as  [PN]'s
       husband.  He drew attention to the Tribunal's  decision  in  R  (oao
       Chen) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Appendix  FM  -
       Chikwamba temporary separation-  proportionality)  IJR  [2015]  UKUT
       00189 (IAC) and the guidance there given as follows:


           "(i) Appendix FM does not include consideration of the  question
           whether it would be disproportionate to expect an individual  to
           return  to  his  home  country  to  make  an   entry   clearance
           application to re-join family members in the U.K. There  may  be
           cases in which there are no insurmountable obstacles  to  family
           life  being  enjoyed  outside  the  U.K.  but  where   temporary
           separation to enable an individual to make  an  application  for
           entry clearance may be disproportionate. In all cases,  it  will
           be for the individual to place before  the  Secretary  of  State
           evidence  that  such   temporary   separation   will   interfere
           disproportionately with protected rights. It will not be  enough
           to rely solely upon the case-law  concerning  Chikwamba  v  SSHD
           [2008] UKHL 40.


           (ii)  Lord Brown was not  laying  down  a  legal  test  when  he
           suggested in Chikwamba that requiring  a  claimant  to  make  an
           application  for  entry  clearance  would  only   "comparatively
           rarely" be proportionate  in  a  case  involving  children  (per
           Burnett J, as he then was, in R (Kotecha and Das v  SSHD  [2011]
           EWHC 2070 (Admin)).


           (iii) In an application for leave on the basis of an  Article  8
           claim, the Secretary of State is not obliged to consider whether
           an application for entry clearance (if one were to be made) will
           be successful. Accordingly, her silence on this issue  does  not
           mean that  it  is  accepted  that  the  requirements  for  entry
           clearance to be granted are satisfied."

   29. Mr Tufan did not dispute the medical evidence and accepted that this
       showed that [PN] suffers from a  number  of  complaints.   Mr  Tufan
       submitted that it was clear that [PN] has family in the UK with whom
       he is in contact and who could support him whilst the Appellant  was
       out of the UK.  [PN]'s evidence  about  this  amounted  only  to  an
       assertion that he did not wish to unduly burden his family.  In  any
       event, if needs be, [PN] could rely on help from social services who
       would be under an obligation to assist as [PN] is a British citizen.

   30. Mr Berry submitted that the  couple  were  only  able  to  have  the
       quality of life they have presently because they are in the UK.  The
       evidence was that the standard of treatment in Spain is not as  good
       as in the UK.  That was the reason they had moved to  the  UK.   The
       healthcare which [PN] is receiving in the UK would be disrupted by a
       move even if that were only temporary (if the couple were to  return
       to Spain for the Appellant to apply for entry clearance  -  assuming
       he could do so from there).

   31. This submission gave rise to further discussion whether  the  couple
       could return to Spain in any event.  The evidence is that [PN]  left
       Spain in either April or May 2017.   [PN]  could  not  remember  the
       precise date.  However, he was in receipt of  medical  treatment  in
       the UK in April 2017.  It is not clear whether the Appellant entered
       with [PN] or came after he had entered.   At  the  latest,  however,
       [PN] came back to the UK  on  9  May  2017.   The  couple  have  not
       returned to Spain since.  As Mr Berry pointed out, [PN]  would  lose
       his entitlement to permanent residence on, at the latest, 9 May 2019
       by reason of a two year' absence.  Although the Appellant still  has
       a valid residence permit for Spain, he would only be able to  return
       to work there as [PN]'s family member and  therefore  only  if  [PN]
       remained a qualified person.  [PN] is unable to work any longer.

   32. Furthermore, as Mr Berry pointed out, there are other  obstacles  to
       the Appellant working in Spain as there were when the  couple  lived
       there before.  The Appellant does not speak Spanish and  was  unable
       to find a job.

   33. Mr Berry therefore submitted that paragraph EX.1(b) of  Appendix  FM
       is met.  There are very significant difficulties  to  relocation  to
       Spain whether permanently or temporarily.  The suggestion  that  the
       Appellant could return to Pakistan to get entry  clearance  is  even
       more fanciful. Clearly, [PN] would be unable to accompany him there.
        There would be disruption to [PN]'s health if  the  Appellant  were
       required to go back to his home country alone in order to get  entry
       clearance.

   34. When considering the "public interest question" outside  the  Rules,
       as Mr Berry pointed out, Section 117B Nationality,  Immigration  and
       Asylum Act 2002 ("Section 117B") is relevant.  He submitted that the
       Appellant does not have an adverse immigration history.  He  entered
       with a valid EEA residence card. I have accepted (as did the  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge) that the Appellant is entitled to  a  residence
       card under the  EEA  Regulations  also  in  the  UK.  As  such,  the
       Appellant is lawfully present in the UK. Although Mr Berry  accepted
       that other factors in Section 117B were neutral, he pointed out that
       the Appellant speaks English (he gave his evidence in English and is
       fluent) and that the couple does not have recourse to public  funds.
       [PN] is in receipt of benefits to which he is entitled by reason  of
       his disability.  The  Appellant  is  working  in  order  to  provide
       further financial support.

   35. In any event, the interference with the couple's family  life  could
       not be justified due to what Mr Berry described  as  the  "egregious
       consequences" in particular for [PN].  Mr Berry submitted that  this
       is one of those rare cases where  there  would  be  a  violation  of
       Article 8 ECHR even if the Appellant cannot meet the Rules.

    DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

   36. As I have already explained, the  only  issue  for  me  to  consider
       within the Rules is whether there are "insurmountable obstacles"  to
       family life continuing outside the UK.  The Respondent accepts  that
       this could not be continued in Pakistan. Given the position for  gay
       men in that country, that concession is  obviously  correctly  made.
       The question is therefore whether there would be such  obstacles  to
       family life continuing in Spain.

   37. I accept of course that the couple were living in Spain before  they
       returned to the UK.  They did so between 2016 and  2017.   [PN]  had
       lived there for two decades previously.  Although the Appellant  was
       unable to find work in Spain, that could not in and of itself amount
       to a very significant obstacle sufficient to meet the  threshold.  I
       also accept that [PN] owns a property in Spain.  That is said to  be
       rented out but, if that were the only obstacle, I would not find the
       threshold to be met.

   38. However, in this case there is the more important factor  of  [PN]'s
       health condition.  Again, I accept that the evidence shows that [PN]
       was receiving treatment in Spain. However, the  evidence  before  me
       shows that [PN]'s condition is deteriorating, and  he  is  suffering
       from even more health problems than  at  the  time  of  his  return.
       Treatment in Spain was said to be of a lower standard  than  in  the
       UK. It is clear from  the  medical  evidence  that  [PN]  is  highly
       dependent on the care which he receives from the NHS in the UK.   It
       is not reasonable to expect him to return to Spain.  He is a British
       citizen and entitled to look to the NHS for his care.

   39. I recognise that the threshold for "insurmountable obstacles"  is  a
       very high one.  However,  having  regard  in  particular  to  [PN]'s
       multiple health problems and the care which he needs and receives in
       the UK, I am satisfied that the threshold is met in this case.  I do
       not repeat the medical evidence which I have  set  out  above.  That
       evidence is the foundation for my conclusion in this regard.

   40. Moreover, there is an additional problem in this case concerning the
       status of [PN] and the Appellant in Spain.  As I have set out above,
       [PN] left Spain on 9 May 2017 at the very latest.  Although  I  have
       to look at the situation at the date of the hearing which  may  have
       been less than two years after [PN] left Spain (although  the  exact
       date is unclear), it is unrealistic to leave  out  of  account  that
       [PN] would not automatically be entitled to return to Spain  relying
       on his permanent residence.  He would lose that entitlement after  9
       May 2019 (and therefore at the date when this decision is  written).
       Although the Appellant still has a valid residence permit, he  would
       only be entitled to re-enter Spain in reliance on that permit as the
       family member of [PN] who would once again have to show that he is a
       qualified person.  Since [PN] is unable to work and therefore is not
       economically active, [PN] would not satisfy that definition  and  it
       is therefore unlikely that the Appellant would be entitled to enter.
        That is not a decisive point in itself.  My conclusion  that  there
       are insurmountable obstacles  is  for  the  reasons  already  given.
       However, it is an additional obstacle to family life  continuing  in
       Spain.

   41. In light of my finding that EX.1(b) of Appendix FM is met, I do  not
       strictly need to go on to consider the position outside  the  Rules.
       It follows from the foregoing reasons  that  I  consider  it  to  be
       unjustifiably harsh for the Appellant and [PN] to  live  permanently
       outside the UK.  On  a  temporary  basis,  the  Appellant  could  be
       expected to return to Pakistan to obtain entry clearance.  He  would
       have to do so alone.  [PN] could not be expected to go with him.   I
       accept that there is limited evidence about [PN]'s  family.   It  is
       not suggested that he  is  estranged  from  his  siblings  and  they
       obviously care about him as it was their influence  which  persuaded
       [PN] that he ought to come back to the UK.  [PN]'s evidence was that
       he would not wish to burden them with his care.  It may be  that  he
       would have to go to live with them whilst the Appellant was  out  of
       the UK because of the need for around the clock care.  The  evidence
       is not that they could not care for him.

   42. However, I am persuaded by Mr Berry's submission that it would still
       be disproportionate to require the Appellant to follow that  course.
       As Mr Berry submitted, and I accept, the Appellant is not in the  UK
       unlawfully.  He has a residence permit given to him by  the  Spanish
       authorities as the family  member  of  a  British  citizen  who  had
       permanent  residence  in  Spain.   The   Respondent   disputes   the
       Appellant's  entitlement  to  remain  in  the  UK  under   the   EEA
       Regulations but I and the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  both  decided
       that the Respondent was wrong in his argument.   As  Mr  Berry  also
       submitted, and I accept, it appears that, once the settlement scheme
       under Appendix EU to the Rules is brought into force, the  Appellant
       will be able to succeed under that scheme because the regulation  on
       which the Respondent relies in his argument in the EEA Appeal is not
       required to be met for that scheme.

   43. Accordingly, when Article 8 ECHR is considered  outside  the  Rules,
       the maintenance of effective immigration control does not  weigh  in
       the balance against the Appellant.  Neither can it be said that  the
       Appellant's family life has been formed whilst here unlawfully which
       is also relevant to the weight to be given to  the  public  interest
       when balanced against  the  interference  to  the  Appellant's  (and
       [PN]'s)  family  life  which  would  arise  from  even  a  temporary
       interference with that family life by  requiring  the  Appellant  to
       return to Pakistan to obtain entry  clearance.  There  is  no  other
       public  interest  requiring  the  Appellant's  removal.   He  speaks
       English.  The couple will not be relying on public funds other  than
       those to which [PN] is entitled  in  any  event  by  reason  of  his
       disability.  Those matters are neutral but do not weigh against  the
       Appellant in this case.

   44. For those reasons, I would also have  found  that  the  interference
       with  the  Appellant's  family  life  occasioned   by   removal   is
       disproportionate when that is considered outside the Rules. However,
       my primary finding is that the Appellant is able to  meet  paragraph
       EX.1(b) of Appendix FM to the Rules and entitled to succeed on  that
       basis.

   45. Accordingly, I find that the Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  the
       Appellant   leave   to   remain   constitutes   a   disproportionate
       interference with the  Appellant's  family  life  and  is  therefore
       unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  I  therefore
       allow the appeal against the refusal of the human rights claim.


    DECISION
    The appeal is allowed.  The Respondent's  decision  is  unlawful  under
    section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            ADJOURNMENT DECISION

    1. The Appellant has applied by  letter  dated  3  April  2019  for  an
       adjournment of a hearing before me on  25  April  2019  which  is  a
       resumed hearing in order to re-make a decision  on  the  Appellant's
       appeal against the refusal of a human rights  claim  dated  28  June
       2018 ("the Human  Rights  Appeal).   The  Human  Rights  Appeal  was
       dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge NMK  Lawrence  on  the  basis
       that there was no valid appeal.  At [9]  and  [10]  of  my  decision
       promulgated on 13 February 2019 ("the Decision") I found there to be
       an error of law in that regard and gave directions including  as  to
       whether the Appellant wished  to  continue  with  the  Human  Rights
       Appeal.   The  reason  for  those  directions  is  because,  by  the
       Decision, I also found no error of law in the First-tier  Tribunal's
       decision allowing a separate appeal against the refusal to  issue  a
       residence card (EA/00402/2018)  ("the  EEA  Appeal").   I  therefore
       upheld the First-tier Tribunal decision in relation to that appeal.


    2. The Appellant accepts that if he succeeds in the EEA  Appeal,  there
       would be little point in pursuing the Human Rights Appeal.  However,
       the Respondent has sought permission  to  appeal  to  the  Court  of
       Appeal against the Decision  in  relation  to  the  EEA  Appeal.   I
       refused permission to appeal by a decision sent on  18  March  2019.
       The Appellant asks for an adjournment of the  hearing  on  25  April
       2019 to await a decision by the  Respondent  whether  to  apply  for
       permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the Decision  in
       the EEA Appeal.  The Respondent's deadline in this regard is  on  or
       about 15 April 2019 and therefore at least a week before the hearing
       before me.  The Respondent's position should  therefore  be  evident
       before the hearing is to take place.


    3. In any event, I do not agree that this has any bearing on the  Human
       Rights Appeal.  Although the human rights claim is predicated on the
       same relationship as the application for a residence card,  and  the
       grounds in this  regard  include  that  to  require  the  couple  to
       relocate to Spain offends  EU  law,  otherwise  the  two  cases  are
       separate and relate to separate appeals.  Although I accept that  to
       proceed with the Human Rights Appeal might ultimately  be  pointless
       if the Respondent fails in his appeal against the Decision  relating
       to the EEA Appeal, that is not good reason to adjourn the hearing.


    4. The Appellant also seeks to adjourn on the basis  that  he  has  now
       made or is now making an application under the EU Settlement Scheme.
        However, that can have no bearing on the Human Rights Appeal.   Any
       application  does  not  give  rise  to  a  right  of  appeal   until
       determined.  Further, it is  unquestionably  a  "new  matter"  which
       would therefore require the Respondent's consent to be  pursued.   I
       doubt such consent would be forthcoming in  circumstances  where  an
       application remained pending but, in  any  event,  a  hearing  would
       probably be required  to  canvas  this  with  the  Respondent.   The
       hearing on 25 April could be used for such purpose if appropriate.


    5. For those reasons, I refuse the application for an adjournment.  The
       hearing on 25 April 2019 will proceed as listed.
    Signed             [pic]           Dated:  5 April 2019
