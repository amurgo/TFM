	DECISION AND REMITTAL

	On 21 June 2018, I wrote to the parties as follows:



“Permission to appeal to this Tribunal has been granted.  The Respondent has filed a notice under rule 24 as follows:



“The Respondent … invites the Upper Tribunal to remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (FTT), without the need for a hearing before the Upper Tribunal, in order to save costs for all parties to the appeal.”



I therefore propose without more ado to set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error of law, and remit the appeal for re-determination by the First-tier Tribunal.  Any submissions to the contrary will be considered if received within 14 days of the date of this letter.”



	There has been no response adverse or otherwise.

	For the reasons given above I now set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error of law.  I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for the re-determination by a different judge. 





C. M. G. OCKELTON
