For the Appellant:     Mr. G Davidson, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr. T Wilding, HOPO


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka, born on 2 July 1988.  He
    entered the UK on a student visa in January 2011.  He claimed asylum on
    26 July 2011.  The SoS refused his application on 24 July 2011.  The
    appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision was dismissed by
    Immigration Judge CM Phillips in a determination promulgated 21
    November 2011.  The Judge's decision was set aside by UTJ Lane.  On 21
    May 2012 a DUTJ held that the judge materially erred in law and her
    decision could not stand.  The appellant's appeal was again dismissed
    by UTJ Martin in September 2012.  Her decision was quashed by the Court
    of Appeal as disclosing an error of law for the reasons set out in the
    Statement of Reasons.

2.   The parties have agreed that the error of law identified in the
    Statement of Reasons has infected the whole of the UTJ's credibility
    findings.  Therefore the appellant's case has to be heard de novo.

3.   The appellant's appeal is remitted to the FtT at Hatton Cross to be
    heard afresh by a judge other than Judge Phillips.

DIRECTIONS
