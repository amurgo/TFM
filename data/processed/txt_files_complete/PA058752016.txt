                               ALI HAMID TUTU
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:       Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr K Forrest, Advocate, instructed by Livingstone
Brown, Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as above, but for continuity and ease of reference, the
    rest of this decision refers to them as they were in the FtT.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Sudan.  The basis of his protection claim
    is set out in the respondent's refusal letter dated  25  May  2016,  in
    terms which he does not dispute.

 3. The respondent's reasons for refusing the claim are also to be found in
    that letter.

 4. The appellant appealed to the FtT by  notice  dated  7  June  2016,  on
    generalised grounds, raising no specific issues.

 5. FtT Judge Kempton heard the appeal on 23 May 2017  and  allowed  it  in
    terms of her decision promulgated on 6 July 2017.

 6. The SSHD's grounds of appeal are based on the country guidance case  of
    IM and AI [2016] UKUT 188, which was not cited in any of the  foregoing
    or at the hearing, and of which the FtT's decision  takes  no  account.
    IM and AI was promulgated on 14 April 2016 and published  on  the  UT's
    website list of CG cases on 22 June 2016.

 7. Mr Matthews referred to the Practice Directions of the Immigration  and
    Asylum Chambers of the FtT and the UT:

      12.4 Because of the principle that like cases  should  be  treated  in
      like manner, any failure to  follow  a  clear,  apparently  applicable
      country guidance case or to show why it does not apply to the case  in
      question is likely to be regarded as grounds for appeal on a point  of
      law.

 8. He referred also to R (Iran &  Others)  v  SSHD  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  983
    (citing a previous practice direction, which was in similar terms):

      27. It will have been noticed that Ouseley J said that any failure  to
      apply a CG decision unless there was good reason,  explicitly  stated,
      for not doing so would constitute an error of law in that  a  material
      consideration had been ignored or legally inadequate reasons  for  the
      decision had been given.  This suggestion has now  been  repeated  and
      adopted in para 18.4 of  the  AIT  Practice  Direction.   We  have  no
      hesitation in endorsing that approach.  It would represent  a  failure
      to take a material matter into account, which  is  the  third  of  the
      generic errors of law we have identified in para 9 above.

 9. AM and CI is headnoted thus:


     1. In order for a person to be at risk on return to Sudan  there  must
        be evidence known to the Sudanese authorities which implicates  the
        claimant in activity  which  they  are  likely  to  perceive  as  a
        potential threat to the regime to the extent  that,  on  return  to
        Khartoum there is a risk to the claimant that he will  be  targeted
        by the authorities.  The task of the decision maker is to  identify
        such a person and this requires as comprehensive an  assessment  as
        possible about the individual concerned.


     2. The evidence draws  a  clear  distinction  between  those  who  are
        arrested,  detained  for  a  short  period,  questioned,   probably
        intimidated, possibly rough handled  without  having  suffered  (or
        being at risk of suffering) serious harm and  those  who  face  the
        much graver risk of serious harm.  The distinction does not  depend
        upon the individual being classified, for example, as a teacher  or
        a journalist (relevant as these matters are) but is the result of a
        finely  balanced  fact-finding  exercise   encompassing   all   the
        information that can be gleaned about him.  The decision  maker  is
        required to place the individual in the airport on return  or  back
        home in his community and assess how the authorities are likely  to
        re-act on the strength of the information known to them about him.


     3. Distinctions must be drawn with those whose political  activity  is
        not particularly great or who do not have great influence.   Whilst
        it does not take much for the NISS to open a file,  the  very  fact
        that  so  many  are  identified  as  potential  targets  inevitably
        requires NISS to distinguish between those whom they view as a real
        threat and those whom they do not.


     4. It will not be enough to make out  a  risk  that  the  authorities'
        interest will be limited to  the  extremely  common  phenomenon  of
        arrest and detention which though intimidating (and designed to  be
        intimidating) does not cross the threshold into persecution.


     5. The purpose of the targeting is likely to be obtaining  information
        about the claimant's  own  activities  or  the  activities  of  his
        friends and associates.


     6. The evidence establishes the targeting is not random but the result
        of suspicion based upon information in the authorities' possession,
        although it may be limited.


     7. Caution should be exercised when the claim is  based  on  a  single
        incident.   Statistically,  a  single  incident  must  reduce   the
        likelihood of the Sudanese authorities  becoming  aware  of  it  or
        treating the claimant as of significant interest.


     8. Where the claim is based on events in Sudan in which  the  claimant
        has come to the attention of the authorities,  the  nature  of  the
        claimant's involvement, the likelihood of this being  perceived  as
        in opposition to the government, his treatment  in  detention,  the
        length of detention and any relevant surrounding circumstances  and
        the likelihood of the event or the detention being made the subject
        of a record are all likely to be material factors.


     9. Where the claim is based on events outside Sudan, the  evidence  of
        the claimant having come to the attention of Sudanese  intelligence
        is bound to be more difficult to establish.  However  it  is  clear
        that the Sudanese  authorities  place  reliance  upon  information-
        gathering about the activities of members  of  the  diaspora  which
        includes  covert  surveillance.   The  nature  and  extent  of  the
        claimant's activities, when and where,  will  inform  the  decision
        maker when he comes to decide whether it is likely those activities
        will attract the attention of the authorities, bearing in mind  the
        likelihood that the authorities will have to distinguish amongst  a
        potentially large group of  individuals  between  those  who  merit
        being targeted and those that do not.


    10. The decision maker must seek to build up as comprehensive a picture
        as possible of  the  claimant  taking  into  account  all  relevant
        material including that which may not have been established even to
        the lower standard of proof.


    11. Once a composite assessment of the evidence has been made, it  will
        be for the decision maker to determine whether there is a real risk
        that the claimant will come to the attention of the authorities  on
        return  in  such  a  way  as  amounts  to  more  than  the  routine
        commonplace detention but meets the threshold of  a  real  risk  of
        serious harm.

    12. Where a claimant has not been  believed  in  all  or  part  of  his
        evidence, the decision maker will have to assess how  this  impacts
        on the requirement to establish that a Convention  claim  has  been
        made out.  He will not have the comprehensive, composite picture he
        would otherwise have had.  There are likely to be shortfalls in the
        evidence that the decision maker is unable to speculate upon.   The
        final analysis will remain the same: has the  claimant  established
        there is a real risk that  he,  the  claimant,  will  come  to  the
        attention of the authorities on return in such a way as amounts  to
        more than the routine commonplace detention and release  but  meets
        the threshold of serious harm.

10. Mr Matthews submitted that applying the guidance to the facts as  found
    by the FtT, the decision fell to be reversed.

11. Mr Forrest relied upon a rule 24 note  in  response  to  the  grant  of
    permission, and  further  sought  valiantly  to  maintain  the  judge's
    decision along these lines:

      i) The principle of the country guidance (ï¿½203 - 206 in particular) is
         to require a rounded assessment of all material  factors  that  may
         place a person at risk in Sudan.

     ii) The judge made such  an  assessment,  and  while  not  specifically
         finding the appellant to be a  member  of  JEM,  she  accepted  the
         evidence of the witness Mr Sharaffedin and had regard to additional
         evidence from the expert witness Mr  Verney,  which  had  not  been
         before a previous judge.

    iii) The decision was safe, because although  unwittingly,  it  followed
         the path established by the country guidance.

     iv) The expert evidence, given orally and in reports of 2013  and  2017
         (the latter postdating the  country  guidance),  provided  the  key
         ingredient to justify the outcome.

12. Alternatively, if error was established, Mr Forrest sought a  remit  to
    the FtT.

13. Mr Matthews replied thus:

      i) The decision could not be read as effectively  compliant  with  the
         guidance.

     ii) The FtT made no findings which could  bring  the  appellant  within
         point (1) of the guidance.

    iii) The decision contained no equivalent of the finely  balanced  fact-
         finding exercise required by point (2), nor  findings  which  might
         trigger such an exercise.  It indicated that the appellant was  not
         known to the authorities.

     iv) There were no findings to cross the threshold at point (4).

      v) The appellant was bound to fail the final analysis at  point  (12).
         He had not established anything to take him beyond the routine  and
         the commonplace to the threshold of serious harm.

     vi) The CG case at ï¿½222 recorded that there was no suggestion  from  Mr
         Verney to the effect that involuntary returnees would  be  at  risk
         for that reason alone.  The UT also considered that had that been a
         general practice, information would have filtered out.  When giving
         evidence to the panel which decided the CG case, Mr Verney had  not
         adhered to what he said in his 2013 report in this  case;  yet  his
         supplementary report of 2017 was in the  same  terms  as  his  2013
         report.

    vii) There was no basis for  deciding  on  the  basis  that  involuntary
         returnees were at risk, rather than on the guidance.

   viii) The FtT's findings at ï¿½34 - 36 were based on no more  than  lengthy
         absence from the country and return on a  travel  document  (rather
         than on a passport).  That outcome could not be sustained once  the
         guidance was applied.

14. I reserved my decision.

15. Parties are equally to blame for failing to draw the  country  guidance
    to the FtT's attention; but the absence of reference to a  relevant  CG
    case is an unmistakable error of  law,  even  in  the  absence  of  any
    relevant submission.

16. There may well be cases where without being aware of country guidance a
    judge reaches a decision along similar lines, and so makes no  material
    error; but this is not such a case.

17. Mr Forrest accepted that it  would  have  been  for  the  appellant  to
    establish that he would have no alternative but to return on  a  travel
    document marking him out as a failed asylum  seeker,  and  he  had  not
    sought to do so. However, his case would fail, even if  he  had  proved
    that point.

18. There was, rightly, no argument that the FtT might have  been  entitled
    on the evidence to go beyond the guidance, or that the UT  in  remaking
    the decision might be entitled to do so.

19. The case is straightforward.  On the findings  made  by  the  FtT,  the
    appellant is not known to the Sudanese authorities for activities which
    they are likely to perceive as a threat.  Even if he may be subject  to
    routine commonplace detention, that does not  reach  the  threshold  of
    serious harm.  His length of absence from  Sudan,  even  together  with
    possible return on a travel document, does not in terms of the guidance
    qualify for protection.

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside.   The  following
    decision is  substituted:  the  appeal,  as  brought  to  the  FtT,  is
    dismissed.

21. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
