For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin of the Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondents:   Ms Victor-Mazeli of Counsel instructed by
     Middlesex Law Chambers

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondents

 1. The Respondents, Zahoor Ahmed and his wife Ghafoora  Khanum  and  their
    daughter Irfah Ahmed are all citizens of Pakistan.   They  are  husband
    and wife and their child born in 2009.  They have another child born in
    2012 whose appeal against the decision of the Appellant (the  SSHD)  of
    23 January 2014 has been found invalid.

 2. On 14 May 2004 the husband was granted leave to  enter  as  a  student.
    Further leave as a student was granted on a number of occasions.  On 23
    January 2014 the SSHD refused the  husband's  application  for  further
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

 3. On 18 March 2006 the wife entered as a dependant of the husband and was
    granted a series of further leaves in line  with  her  husband.   On  6
    August 2010 their elder child was granted leave to enter as a dependant
    and has been granted further leave in line.

 4. The two children of the husband and wife were both born in  London  and
    are minors.

Background to the Application Leading to the Decision under Appeal

 5. On 31 August 2012 the SSHD gave notice to the husband that with  effect
    from 30 October 2012 his leave would be curtailed.  Despite  a  Freedom
    of Information Act (FOI) request, there does not appear to be a copy of
    this notice in the Tribunal file.

 6. On 9 October the husband, wife and  their  two  children  made  further
    applications for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant
    and dependants which in January 2013 were rejected by the Respondent as
    invalid because the requisite fees had not been paid.

 7. On 19 February 2013 they re-submitted their applications  which  on  23
    January 2014 the SSHD refused on the basis  that  they  had  failed  to
    supply bank statements for a period ending  within  one  month  of  the
    applications which constituted a failure to meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix C of the Immigration Rules.  It is noted the statements  would
    have covered the  relevant  period  of  time  if  the  9  October  2012
    applications had been accepted as valid.

 8. On 10 February 2014  the  applicants  lodged  notice  of  appeal.   The
    grounds are brief and formulaic.

 9. On 2 July 2014 they made another application, this time, for indefinite
    leave on the basis of the husband's claimed ten years' lawful residence
    upon which it would appear the SSHD has not made a  separate  decision.



Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

10. By a decision promulgated on 20 October 2015 Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Kennedy allowed the appeals, relying on the  jurisprudence  in
    Basnet (validity of application - Respondent) [2012] UKUT 113 (IAC) and
    found that the applications of 9 October 2012 were  valid  and  allowed
    the appeals.  In relation to the ten years' lawful residence claim  the
    Judge found as a fact that the husband had not accumulated  ten  years'
    lawful residence before the date of the decision under appeal and  that
    this additional ground in fact was in effect a new application based on
    events occurring after the date of the decision to refuse further leave
    as a student and dependants.

11. The SSHD challenged the Judge's treatment of the 9 October applications
    as valid, noting that subsequent to the hearing before  the  Judge  and
    the signing of the decision  but  before  its  promulgation  the  Upper
    Tribunal had reported its  decision  in  Mitchell  (Basnet  re-visited)
    [2015] UKUT 00562 (IAC).

12. On 14 April 2016 Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Macdonald
    granted the SSHD permission to appeal because whereas Basnet had placed
    the burden of proof on the SSHD, Mitchell had recognised that the  SSHD
    may not have access to the reasons why a payment had been declined  and
    a more nuanced approach to the burden of proof might be needed.

Proceedings in the Upper Tribunal

13. The husband was present at the hearing.  I explained  the  purpose  and
    procedure to be followed in an error of law hearing.  He confirmed  his
    address as recorded in the Tribunal file.

14. Both parties agreed the  sole  issue  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  was
    whether the Judge's treatment of the  issue  of  the  payment  of  fees
    disclosed a material error of law.  Ms Victor-Mazeli opened by  stating
    that although the decision under appeal was of the  second  application
    made on 19 February 2013  that  application  was  a  variation  of  the
    previously and wrongly rejected October 2012 application.

Submissions for the SSHD

15. Mr Melvin referred to  pages  426  and  430  of  the  bundle  disclosed
    pursuant to the FOI request.  These  noted  that  the  application  was
    invalid because payment of the required fee of �969 had been  declined.
    The jurisprudence in Mitchell was applicable because Mitchell had  been
    reported  before  the  Judge's  decision  had  been  promulgated.   The
    consequence was that the Judge should  be  considered  as  having  mis-
    directed himself and the SSHD should be entitled to the benefit of  the
    decision in Mitchell reported before promulgation.

Submissions for the Applicants

16. Ms Victor-Mazeli noted that the decision in Mitchell had been  reported
    some two and a half months after the Judge heard the  appeal.   At  the
    time the relevant law was that referred to in Basnet and the Judge  had
    correctly directed himself so there was no material error of law in his
    decision.  In any event, if the  Judge  had  considered  Mitchell,  she
    submitted, he would have  come  to  the  same  decision.   The  October
    application was on its face good and the burden was on the SSHD to show
    the fees had not been paid.  Further, the decision in Mitchell could be
    distinguished because in Mitchell's case the appellant  had  failed  to
    sign the mandate for payment of fees of her first application.

17. The Judge had considered the evidence for the SSHD and had referred  at
    paragraph 32 to the relevant pages in the FOI request bundle.   On  the
    evidence he was entitled to reach to his conclusions.  She pointed  out
    the FOI request bundle showed that the 19 February 2013 application the
    SSHD had mislaid the fees and submitted that if this  had  happened  on
    the second application it was possible there had been a similar  mishap
    with the fees for the 9 October 2012 application.  It was of note  that
    the SSHD had been unrepresented at the hearing before the Judge.

Response for the SSHD

18. Mr Melvin reiterated that the decision in Mitchell  had  been  reported
    before the Judge's decision had been promulgated.

Consideration and Conclusion

19. In a closely focused and well-constructed decision the  Judge  properly
    applied the law as explained in Basnet.  Through no fault of the Judge,
    the law was subsequently explained  in  Mitchell  reported  before  the
    Tribunal administration had promulgated the decision  which  the  Judge
    had signed  before  Mitchell  was  reported.   Mitchell  explained  the
    existing law and so is applicable to the circumstances of this  appeal.
    It is therefore with considerable reluctance that I find  the  decision
    contains a material error of law.

20. Although  both  parties  agreed  that  I  might  determine  the  appeal
    substantively without further submissions, I have on reviewing the file
    come to the conclusion that this is not practicable for  reasons  which
    follow.

21. There is no explanation from the Respondent of the expression  at  page
    420 in the FOI bundle of the wording: "The application  is  potentially
    in-valid due to  �  -  fee  declined"  recorded  on  19  October  2012.
    Similarly there is no explanation  of  the  meaning  of  "(symbol)  PUK
    Payment Error" at page 430 of the bundle recorded for 17 October  2012.
    On the other hand, the husband and wife have failed to identify clearly
    the means of payment tendered for the application of 9 October 2012 and
    to supply sufficient evidence to show  that  the  relevant  account  or
    accounts were in funds for the period 9-18 October  2012.   The  credit
    card payment records which have so far been  submitted  are  incomplete
    for the relevant period and there is an issue  as  to  the  appropriate
    credit card number which Ms Victor-Mazeli  sought  to  explain  at  the
    hearing by stating that  the  card  issued  on  the  account  had  been
    replaced by a new card with a different number.  Additionally, the bank
    statements for the same period which have so  far  been  submitted  are
    incomplete or missing.  For these reasons, the matter must be  remitted
    for a further hearing which having regard to Practice Statement 7.2  of
    November 2014 should be in the First-tier Tribunal before a Judge other
    than Judge Kennedy.

22. The facts as found by the Judge at paragraphs 32 and 33 of his decision
    shall stand but will need to be considered in  conjunction  with  other
    evidence, some of which I have already identified, through the prism of
    Mitchell.

Anonymity

23. There was no request for an anonymity order and I  find  that  none  is
    warranted.

Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law and is set aside to the limited extent for the issue  whether  fees
    on the 9 October 2012 application were paid to be remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal for consideration afresh.

DIRECTIONS

By no later than ten working days before the next hearing  the  parties  are
to file and serve as appropriate the respective explanations  and  documents
referred to in paragraph 21 above.
