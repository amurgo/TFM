Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr V Makol (Maalik & Co)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of  State  but  for  convenience  I
    will refer to the original appellant, a citizen of Pakistan born on  28
    March 1980, as the appellant herein.

2.   The appellant arrived as a student on 10 October 2006 and  was  granted
    extensions of stay as a student until 2011 and  subsequently  until  21
    March 2013 under Tier 1 (Post-Study).

3.   On 2 March 2013 the appellant applied for leave to remain as a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) but this application was refused on 17 June  2013.   The
    respondent was not satisfied that the appellant genuinely  intended  to
    establish the business or that he  genuinely  intended  to  invest  the
    money required under table 4 of Appendix A in the business nor that  it
    was genuinely  available  to  him.   Among  the  points  taken  by  the
    respondent was that the name of the appellant's company did not feature
    in a Companies House search and the respondent referred  to  what  were
    claimed to be errors  and  inconsistencies  in  the  agreement  reached
    raising concerns as to whether there was genuine evidence  of  trading.
    The respondent noted that the appellant's sister had made a third party
    declaration in which she stated that she would make  �50,000  available
    to the appellant to invest in his business and this was supported by  a
    letter  from  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan.   The  respondent  was
    concerned as to whether the  funds  were  genuinely  available  to  the
    appellant.

4.   The respondent raised other concerns about  whether  the  business  was
    viable, noting the appellant had no real business experience and he had
    not apparently used his period of current leave  to  undertake  genuine
    and credible steps to prepare, plan, develop and launch  his  business.
    There were concerns that the appellant wished to extend  his  stay  for
    economic reasons and about  his  intentions.   The  appellant  did  not
    accordingly score the required number of points.

5.   The matter came before a First-tier Judge on 2 January  2014  when  the
    appellant was represented, as he is now, by Mr Makol.  Having  set  out
    the evidence the judge's decision concluded as follows:

         "13. In oral evidence the appellant stated that he had only  issued
             one invoice so far in the sum of �500 and was awaiting receipt
             of �50,000 from his sister who would not have  any  shared  in
             the company.  The appellant had made it very clear that he had
             only signed one contract which  he  had  referred  to  in  his
             application.  He accepted that he  did  not  have  a  business
             account and had maintained turnover of  approximately  �2,000.
             He was hoping to concentrate  on  resolving  the  visa  appeal
             issue first before seeking injection of funds from his sister.


         14.  At the conclusion  of  the  oral  evidence,  I  heard  helpful
             submissions from both representatives which I have  considered
             and noted in the record of proceedings.


         15.  For reasons that follow  I  find  that  this  appeal  must  be
             allowed.


         16.  I accept that the concern of the respondent  could  have  been
             clarified in relation to the status of Precision  Repairs  Ltd
             by further enquiry, as there was in existence a  firm  with  a
             similar name, but this was not undertaken.


         17.  I also accept that it is not  necessary  for  the  appellant's
             sister Mr Jarved to make  an  initial  investment  of  �50,000
             prior to granting of the Entrepreneur visa.  I accept that  if
             a visa is granted, and the funds  are  not  forthcoming,  then
             such a visa will be subject to curtailment provisions.


         18.  I am therefore not concerned as to whether these  funds  would
             be genuinely available.   I  accept  that  the  appellant  has
             supplied a contract but I do not find that the  appellant  has
             sought to suggest the creation of  a  website  which  I  agree
             entirely is a separate business, but rather  that  he  was  at
             pains  to  suggest   that   he   would   include   contractual
             arrangements in his website.  I also accept that the appellant
             does  have  relevant  business  academic  studies   which   is
             acknowledged in the refusal decision itself.


         19.  Nor do I make any adverse findings by virtue of the fact  that
             the business  does  not  require  mandatory  accreditation  or
             registration.  I also find it credible that the appellant  may
             wish to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  the  economy  is
             presently stable and that he had credible  reasons  for  doing
             so.  There is no adverse immigration known in relation to  the
             appellant which I must weigh in his favour.  "

6.   Accordingly the judge allowed the appeal.

7.   Permission to appeal was applied for by the Secretary of State  arguing
    that the judge had dealt with the issues raised in the  refusal  letter
    briefly and inadequately in the paragraphs which I have recited  above.
    It was noted that checks  had  been  conducted  about  the  appellant's
    company and there had been no  company  called  Precision  Repairs  and
    Company Limited.  No findings had been made as  to  how  the  appellant
    satisfied Appendix A and there was  insufficient  evidence  as  to  the
    appellant's access to the purportedly  available  funds  and  that  the
    funds were disposable in the United Kingdom.  It was not clear how  the
    judge had arrived at a  conclusion  that  the  appellant  was  able  to
    satisfy the requirements of the Rules.

8.   Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Judge  Holmes  on  22
    January 2014 commenting that the judge had  failed  to  deal  with  the
    issue about whether the funds relied upon in  Pakistan  were  genuinely
    available to the appellant.  It was suggested that the judge had  quite
    simply misread the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  There was no
    finding that the appellant genuinely intended to establish  a  business
    in the UK.

9.   Mr Tarlow  relied  on  the  grounds  and  submitted  that  the  judge's
    reasoning was inadequate and in particular he was in error to state  in
    paragraph 18 that he was not concerned as to whether the funds would be
    genuinely available.  The judge had failed to come to  grips  with  the
    detailed reasons in the refusal letter.  There were no  findings  about
    whether the appellant genuinely intended to finance a business and  the
    findings were indeed so lacking that the appeal should be remitted  for
    a fresh hearing.

10.  Mr Makol submitted that the Rules relating  to  entrepreneurs  had  not
    received effective parliamentary  scrutiny  having  been  presented  to
    Parliament on 30 January 2013 and brought  into  force  on  31  January
    2013.

11.  I told Mr Makol I had no power to declare the Rules to be ultra  vires.
     I note this does not appear to have been a point that featured in  the
    initial grounds of appeal and if it were raised the judge did not  deal
    with it.  The Court of Appeal in Ishtiaq v Secretary  of  State  [2007]
    EWCA Civ 386 made the position perfectly clear at paragraph 58  -  even
    if a Rule was ultra vires the Tribunal must  give  it  full  force  and
    effect and had no power to declare it to be ultra vires.  Even  in  the
    Upper Tribunal's new jurisdiction of judicial review  the  Tribunal  is
    not permitted to entertain a challenge to the validity  of  Immigration
    Rules under the direction of the Lord Chief Justice of 21 August 2013.

12.  Mr Makol submitted that the findings  were  adequate  and  reminded  me
    that he was present at the hearing and while the wording  of  paragraph
    18 of the determination was unfortunate when read as a whole, the judge
    had not erred in law.

13.  Both parties were agreed that  the  material  part  of  the  applicable
    version of the Rules relating to entrepreneurs is as set out below.

14.  I told the parties that the judge had clearly  erred  in  paragraph  18
    and that in the light of the  points  made  by  Mr  Tarlow  and  having
    listened to the submissions of Mr Makol this was a case which had to be
    remitted for a fresh hearing.

15.  The Rules require that an applicant genuinely  intends  to  invest  the
    money referred to in  table  4  of  Appendix  A  in  the  business  and
    paragraph 245DD(iii) provides:

     "that the money referred to in table  4  of  Appendix  A  is  genuinely
    available to the applicant, and will remain available to him until such
    time as it is spent by his business or businesses.  "Available to  him"
    means that the funds are:

    (1)  in his own possession,


    (2)  in the financial accounts of a UK incorporated business  of  which
         he is a director, or


    (3)  available from the third party or parties named in the application
         under the terms of the declaration(s) referred to in paragraph  41-
         SD(b) of Appendix A;...".


    It does appear, with respect, that  the  judge  did  misinterpret  this
    Rule.  The money must be genuinely available to the applicant  -  these
    words are not qualified by what follows.   It  appears  that  Mr  Makol
    accepted that the judge had misdirected himself  in  this  respect  but
    submitted that when the determination  was  read  as  a  whole  it  was
    sustainable.


16.  I am unable to  accept  that  this  is  the  case.   The  reasoning  in
    inadequate as Mr Tarlow points out and it  is  impossible  to  overlook
    what is stated in paragraph 18 when this was a clear misdirection.  The
    judge was indeed concerned with whether the funds  would  be  genuinely
    available and wrong to find otherwise.

17.  For the reasons I have given, this appeal must be remitted for  hearing
    afresh before a different First-tier Judge with none of the findings to
    stand.





Signed                                  Date 7 March 2014
