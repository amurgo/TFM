For the Respondent:    Mrs Obomi Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

      1. I have considered whether any parties require the protection of  an
         anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in
         respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the  circumstances
         and evidence I do not consider it necessary to  make  an  anonymity
         direction.

      2. The Appellant was born on 10 February 1969 and  is  a  national  of
         Iran.

      3. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred  to  as  they
         were in the First-tier Tribunal.

      4. The Appellant appealed against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of
         State dated 8 September 2016 to refuse to grant an application  for
         protection status. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Malik  dismissed  the
         appeal and the  Appellant  now  appeals  with  permission  to  this
         Tribunal.

      5. The Appellant did not attend. Mrs Obomi produced a screenshot  from
         the Respondents database to show that the  Appellant  had  departed
         the UK voluntarily on 5 March 2018 from Heathrow.

    The Law

      6. The Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 s92(8) provides  as
         follows:

         "(8)     Where an appellant brings an appeal from within the United
         Kingdom but leaves the United Kingdom before the appeal is  finally
         determined, the appeal is to be treated  as  abandoned  unless  the
         claim to which the appeal relates has been certified under  section
         94(1) or (7) or section 94B."

      7. Section104 (2) provides:

         "(2)     An appeal under section 82(1) is  not  finally  determined
         for the purpose of subsection (1)(b) while -

             (a) an application for permission to appeal under  section  11
             or 13 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007  could
             be made or is awaiting determination,

             (b) permission to appeal under either of  those  sections  has
             been granted and the appeal is awaiting determination."

    CONCLUSION

      8. I am satisfied that by his voluntary  departure  from  the  UK  the
         Appellant has abandoned his undetermined appeal.

      9. No further action is required by the Tribunal.

    DECISION

     10. The appeal is abandoned
