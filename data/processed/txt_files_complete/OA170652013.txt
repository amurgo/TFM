                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr J Nicholson, instructed by Watson Ramsbottom
Partnership
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Mohamed Abdulla Hansrot,  date  of  birth  1.6.59,  is  a
    citizen of India.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Agnew promulgated  31.3.14,  allowing  the
    claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  respondent,  dated
    15.8.13, to refuse his application for revocation  of  the  deportation
    order made against him on  15.1.02.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    19.3.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Lewis refused to extend time  for  permission
    to appeal on 20.8.14. However, when  renewed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman granted permission to appeal.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.1.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. At the outset of the hearing Mr Nicholson took  the  preliminary  point
    that the appeal was out  of  time  and  time  had  not  been  extended.
    Although Judge Macleman did not spell it out,  I  take  the  view  that
    properly read it can be readily inferred that Judge  Macleman  extended
    time, and found the grounds of appeal arguable, stating that "It  might
    be thought that the conclusion reached at �25  does  not  readily  flow
    from the consideration at �19-24." I thus proceed  on  the  basis  that
    time has been extended.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Agnew should be set aside.

 7. The relevant background is that the claimant was deported in 2002, as a
    result of his commission of an offence of indecent assault on a  female
    whilst in a position of trust as a minister of religion  and  when  the
    victim was a girl with physical  hardships  including  being  deaf  and
    having mild to moderate learning difficulties. He was  sentenced  to  a
    term of 6 months imprisonment.

 8. A previous application to revoke the deportation order was refused  and
    the appeal against refusal dismissed in 2011.

 9. Judge Agnew allowed the appeal,

10.  Ms  Johnstone  relied  on  the  drafted  grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal which in essence are that the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge failed to provide adequate reasons for the conclusion at �25 that
    the order should be revoked. At �25 the judge stated "In light  of  all
    the circumstances I find that the deportation order should be revoked."
    However,  it  is  not  clear  at  all  from  the   determination   what
    circumstances the judge has taken into account in order to  reach  this
    conclusion. Reading the decision, the matters set out  in  �19  through
    �24 all mitigate against revocation. For  example,  at  �21  the  judge
    found that the claimant "has seriously unrepresented the actual offence
    he committed and his reprehensible behaviour thereafter  in  attempting
    to deny it." The  claimant  continues  to  deny  that  he  intended  to
    indecently assault the vulnerable victim, which the judge  rejected  as
    not true, stating, "It is of concern that the appellant still  has  not
    had the courage or integrity to reveal the full details of his offence,
    and admit full responsibility for it. Without this, it is difficult  to
    believe he shows remorse over and above what effect  the  sentence  and
    consequences has had on his family."

11. At �23, in respect of the separation of the claimant from his family in
    the UK, the judge noted the findings of the previous  judge  that  this
    was a deliberate choice on the part of the claimant and his  wife.  The
    family had the opportunity to follow him to India, but chose not to  do
    so, preferring to remain in the UK  in  the  "best  interests"  of  the
    family. At �24 the judge did not  consider  the  claimant's  interests,
    given that he has been working and living in South Africa  for  several
    years leaving his family in the UK by choice, so adversely affected  as
    to on that basis alone justify the revocation of the deportation order.



12. One is left to wonder on what basis the judge  reached  the  conclusion
    that the deportation order should be revoked. It is not  necessary  for
    the judge to rehearse every detail or issue, but he/she must explain at
    least in brief and clear terms why he/she reached the  decision  he/she
    did, so that the parties can understand why  they  have  won  or  lost:
    Budhathaki (reasons for decision) [2014] UKUT 00341.  The  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal fails to meet that standard.

13. What may have persuaded the judge  to  conclude  that  the  deportation
    order should be revoked, though it is far from clear, is  an  erroneous
    interpretation  of  paragraph  391(a),  which  provides  that,   "..the
    continuation of a deportation order against that  person  will  be  the
    proper course: (a) in the case of a conviction for an offence for which
    the person was sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  less  than  4
    years unless 10 years have elapsed since the making of the  deportation
    order.." However, this only indicates that it will be the proper course
    if 10 years have not elapsed. It does not follow that if 10 years  have
    elapsed revocation is the proper course. The elapse of time is only one
    consideration, and other considerations including  those  in  paragraph
    390 have to be taken into account.

14. At �15 of the decision, which  is  difficult  to  decipher,  the  judge
    stated in the first sentence that, "As I read paragraph 391(a),  as  10
    years have elapse and the sentence of imprisonment was of less  than  4
    years, the continuation of  a  deportation  order  is  not  the  proper
    course." That is a misstatement of the provision and a misdirection  in
    law, which Mr Nicholson was at a loss to explain to me. I  accept  that
    the judge went on to observe in the same paragraph that 391(a) is to be
    read in the light of 390,"Otherwise, a deportation order  would  always
    be revoked after 10 years and that does not appear to be the  intention
    of the respondent in the drafting of the relevant Rules," but that does
    not explain the error in the first sentence.

15. It is impossible to be satisfied from the  above  that  the  judge  has
    correctly understood paragraph 391(a), and if there was such  an  error
    of law, as there may well have been, it necessarily  adversely  affects
    the weight the judge accorded to other relevant factors, some of  which
    were those submitted by the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  at  the
    hearing and noted at �17 of the decision.

16. In the circumstances and for the reasons stated, I find that there  was
    such error of law in the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  that  it
    cannot stand and must be set aside and remade.

17. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the  facts  or  findings  are
    unclear on a crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in
    this case, effectively there has not  been  a  valid  determination  of
    those issues. The errors of the First-tier Tribunal vitiates all  other
    findings of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has
    not been a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

18. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusion & Decision:

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be decided afresh.

Consequential Directions

20. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Bradford;

21. No findings of fact are preserved and the appeal is to  be  a  de  novo
    hearing;

22. The time estimate is 2 hours;

23. If an interpreter was required at the hearing on  19.3.14,  one  should
    also be allocated in the same language;

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
