                          Determination and Reasons

Background

 1.   This matter first came before me on 2 October  2014.  Following  that
    hearing I decided that First-tier Tribunal Judge Powell who had allowed
    the appeal on Article 8 grounds had made an error  of  law  and  I  set
    aside his determination. My reasons are set out in my decision dated 14
    October. I now deal with the resumed hearing.

 2.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on  22  August  1977.  She
    last entered the UK as a visitor on 20 April 2012 and four  days  later
    applied for indefinite leave to remain as the  mother  of  two  British
    children. Her partner, also of Nigerian origin but a British  national,
    was present in the UK. The application was refused on 4  July  2013  on
    the basis that she did not meet the requirements  of  Appendix  FM,  R-
    LTRP.1.1 (d), E-LTRP.2.1, E-LTRPT.2.2-2.4 or 3.1 and could not  benefit
    from EX.1. Her case was considered under  paragraph  276ADE  but  those
    requirements were not met either and the Secretary of  State  took  the
    view that her circumstances did not warrant consideration  outside  the
    rules. A decision to remove her was made.

The hearing

 3.   I heard oral evidence from  the  appellant  and  her  partner,  Lanre
    Bhadmus. The appellant gave evidence first. She relied upon her witness
    statement and confirmed it was accurate. She said she  lived  with  her
    partner and children. They had been together for eight years. They  had
    lived in Nigeria until she came here with  the  children  on  20  April
    2012. The children were aged 8 and 6. They were at school. Her  partner
    had travelled before her and she joined him using  a  visit  visa.  She
    then applied to remain because her  husband  was  in  poor  health.  He
    suffered from diabetes and was partially  blind.  She  stated  she  had
    never worked in Nigeria and was supported by her partner. If she had to
    return to Nigeria she would not be able to support herself so it  would
    be inconvenient. Further, if the children remained, her  partner  would
    be unable to look after them. If they accompanied her, their  education
    would be affected.

 4.   In cross examination the appellant said that she  had  no  family  in
    Nigeria. Her parents were dead and she had a sister in Dublin. She  had
    no uncles, aunts or cousins.

 5.   She stated that that her husband had suffered a stroke in 2011 whilst
    in the UK. He then returned to Nigeria in October  2011.  He  then  saw
    some neighbours had died after strokes so he decided to come to the UK.
     He re-entered the UK in January 2012, returned to Nigeria in March and
    then back again to the UK at the end of March 2012. She had remained in
    Nigeria with the children until 20 April 2012. He  had  been  regularly
    visiting the UK throughout their married life,  not  just  for  medical
    treatment. When he left in March, she did not expect him to return. She
    travelled to join him but had planned to go back to Nigeria  with  him.
    However when she arrived, he told her the same  day  that  he  did  not
    intend to return to Nigeria.  She then made her application because  he
    was feeling down and she thought it would affect the  children  if  she
    went and left them.

 6.   The appellant stated that her partner worked full time at night as  a
    security officer. They did not receive any benefits. His  income  would
    be insufficient to support her if she returned to Nigeria. It was  more
    expensive in Nigeria than in the UK. She had no idea what a hotel would
    cost.  She denied that they had already planned that  they  would  stay
    here before she had come. She said that  he  had  two  brothers  and  a
    sister in Nigeria. It would not be convenient to stay with them as they
    all lived in one roomed accommodation.

 7.   In re-examination the appellant confirmed that her partner  had  told
    her of his plans to stay here on the day she arrived. He had said  that
    he had been to the hospital and that  his  health  was  not  good.  Her
    partner's monthly income was �1000 or �1100 net.

 8.    In response to questions I then put for clarification, the appellant
    stated that she  had  been  in  contact  with  her  partner  after  his
    departure. They had last spoken a few days before her arrival.  He  met
    them at the airport. He had been in  hospital  a  few  days  after  his
    arrival here. He had been here about 3  weeks  prior  to  her  arrival.
    Prior to that he used to visit the UK every 3-4  months  for  around  2
    weeks at a time. Once a year or so, she would accompany him. She agreed
    that the children were used to separations from him. The appellant said
    that they had lived in rented accommodation in  Nigeria  and  had  just
    left it when they came here. They also left their belongings. She  then
    said they gave them away. Her partner went back in October 2012 to sort
    it all out. He stayed away for two weeks and  then  returned  again  in
    October 2013 for a week. She was not sure about the cost of a ticket to
    Nigeria but thought it was about �400. She said they paid �400 in  rent
    a month. His salary of  �1000  was  before  taking  rental  costs  into
    account. They had no savings and no credit card debts. When  asked  how
    they were able to afford trips to Nigeria, she said that they  received
    child benefit. They had made enquiries  about  the  waiting  times  for
    visas and had been told that this was 3-6  months.   When  her  partner
    visited Nigeria, he stayed  with  friends.  Those  were  my  questions.
    Neither party had any questions arising.

 9.   I then heard from Mr Bhadmus. He relied on his witness statement  and
    confirmed he lived with his partner and children. He said  he  suffered
    from high blood pressure and diabetes. In 2011 he had a stroke and lost
    30% of his vision. He did not drive as  a  result.  He  relied  on  the
    appellant to take care of the children. Due to his employment, he could
    not do things with the children.  He  stated  that  the  appellant  had
    intended to return when she came here but the situation  changed.  When
    asked what had changed, he said that he had decided to  stay  with  the
    children because of his health. He had had a stroke in 2011 and so when
    he came here on 2 April 2012, he decided to remain. He stated he  would
    not be able to cope with caring fro the children because  his  daughter
    relied on her mum. His partner did all the cooking.  He  said  he  took
    medication for diabetes, high blood pressure and for the stroke. If the
    appellant returned to Nigeria, he would lose his job and his house.  He
    paid �400 a month for the mortgage but from January that would fall  to
    �324. His income was �950 per month net but he received �730 per  month
    in tax credits and also received child benefit. The children could  not
    accompany the appellant to Nigeria as there was  no  means  of  support
    there, it was unsafe and the children were settled at school. They  had
    friends here and he would miss them if they  left.  Mr  Bhadmus  stated
    that if the children left, all the benefits he  received  would  cease.
    When asked whether he had made enquiries about that, he conceded he had
    not. He said that they had sold their property in Nigeria in  order  to
    buy the house here.

10.   The witness was then cross examined. He said that he was  advised  to
    reduce his stress and as he had felt less stressed here, he decided  to
    remain. He was asked whether he had received any medical advice or been
    to any appointment as a result of which he had decided  to  remain.  He
    said that he was meant to see the consultant in May. He had also had an
    appointment in February 2012 and had travelled here for  that.  He  had
    been told that February that he should reduce his stress. He could  not
    recall if he had told the appellant about this. He said that he decided
    to remain here on 10 April. He then changed this to 21 April  and  then
    changed his evidence again and said he had decided before the appellant
    came here. He told her when she arrived. He denied she had known  prior
    to her entry. She had  a  multiple  visit  entry  clearance.  He  could
    provide no explanation for why he had not told  the  appellant  of  his
    plans before she came here. He said he had no  excuse  but  thought  he
    would show her his doctor's appointment letter.   He confirmed that the
    appellant had continued to live in their house until her departure.  He
    could not explain why she would have said it was rented.  He  said  the
    house had been put up for sale prior to his departure and was  sold  in
    July 2012. He told her the house was up for sale when she  arrived.  He
    made no response when he was twice asked to confirm that he had put the
    house up for sale before the appellant arrived here.  He  said  he  had
    received �85,000 from the sale of the house. He bought a house here for
    �180,000. He had had savings of �40,000 but now these amounted to �600.
    He  had  just  one  brother  and  some  uncles  in  Nigeria.  When  the
    appellant's evidence was put to him, he said his sister was married and
    he did not speak to his other  brother.  His  siblings  all  had  small
    flats. He had not checked the costs of hotel accommodation  in  Nigeria
    but did not believe he would be able to afford it from what he used  to
    know. He had no spare money. That completed cross examination.

11.   In re-examination Mr Bhadmus  said  that  he  had  waited  until  the
    appellant's arrival to tell her of his plans because he wanted  her  to
    be here physically and to see the reasons he did not want to return.

12.   I asked him for her reaction to this information.  He  said  she  had
    mixed feelings. I asked what his plans had been  prior  to  his  health
    problems. He stated that he had intended to  return  before  his  son's
    sixth birthday. When the children arrived here, his son was 5. He  said
    that he worked 48 hours a week from 10 pm until 6 or 8 am but sometimes
    he would work until 10 and sometimes he started work earlier. He  would
    see the children before they went to school on the days he finished  at
    6 and then he slept until 2 when he would wake up until 4; he then went
    back to sleep. He worked five nights a  week.  Neither  party  had  any
    questions arising and that completed the oral evidence.

13.   I then heard submissions from both sides. These are fully set out  in
    my Record of Proceedings. In summary, Mr Jarvis relied on his  skeleton
    argument and submitted that the rules prevented visitors from switching
    and so  the  appellant  could  not  bring  herself  within  the  rules.
    Following Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1 not free standing) [2014]  UKUT  63
    (IAC), EX.1 could not apply. It  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  entry
    clearance control if visitors were permitted to switch. He acknowledged
    that the Act recognised the weight to be attached to relationships with
    children and accepted that family life existed  but  pointed  out  that
    other factors had to be considered too. The  prohibition  on  switching
    was a serious matter which weighed heavily against the  appellant.  The
    evidence made it obvious that circumstances did not  evolve  after  the
    appellant's entry. There had been a clear  and  deliberate  attempt  to
    break the law. The appellant had no intention of leaving when  she  had
    entered. It was not credible that she would not have  known  about  the
    sale of the house. This was a deliberate  attempt  to  queue  jump  and
    showed a disregard for the rules and of those  others  who  waited  and
    applied in the proper way. It was not disproportionate for the children
    to accompany their mother to Nigeria for a short time; this  would  not
    be a permanent separation and not unusual given their father's  regular
    travel history.  I  was  asked  to  reject  the  account  of  financial
    difficulties as the truth had not been told and the true  circumstances
    of the appellant were not known. The appellant's family life had always
    been precarious as she had known she was here  on  a  temporary  basis.
    There were no compelling circumstances which were required where  there
    was a failure to meet the rules.

14.   Ms Hannan adopted her skeleton argument and relied on the documentary
    evidence.  She  submitted  that  EX.1  should  apply.  Removal  of  the
    appellant would cause great difficulties friend the  family  given  the
    sponsor's hours of work and the age of the children. If the rules  were
    not met then they qualified under Article 8.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had found there was family life. There was no property to  return
    to in  Nigeria.  Relatives  there  had  inadequate  accommodation.  The
    sponsor was not in a position to  cover  the  costs  if  the  appellant
    returned. There would be financial consequences  and  also  a  physical
    impact on the sponsor's health. There was no concrete evidence to prove
    deception by the appellant. This was not the first time  she  had  been
    here. Her partner told her of his decision to  remain  here  after  her
    arrival because he wanted to explain his  decision  on  a  one  to  one
    basis. It would be disproportionate for the children to leave the UK as
    their education would be disrupted. It was not in the  children's  best
    interests to disturb their lives. Moving to Nigeria would affect  their
    development.

Findings and conclusions

15.   I have carefully considered  all  the  evidence  before  me  and  the
    submissions that have been made by both parties. I assess the  evidence
    in the round and applying the lower standard of proof. I am aware  that
    as I am re-making the decision I am required to consider section 117 of
    the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.  Section  117A(2)
    requires that the Tribunal must in particular have regard  to  all  the
    considerations in 117B. These are :


         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
         public interest.


         (2) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
         (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
         (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (3) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-
         (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
         (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (4) Little weight should be given to-
         (a) a private life, or
         (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.


         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.


         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-
         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
         with a qualifying child, and
         (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom.


16.   I accept the finding of the First-tier Tribunal Judge with regard  to
    there being family life between the  appellant  and  her  children  and
    partner. That has not been challenged by the respondent and  indeed  in
    his submissions Mr Jarvis agreed that family life had been established.



17.   It is not disputed that the appellant arrived here on  a  visit  visa
    and that she then sought discretionary leave to  remain  on  Article  8
    grounds. Although Ms Hannan's initial submission to  me  was  that  the
    appellant met the requirements of the rules, she did not seek to expand
    on that submission and did not address the fact that the appellant only
    made an application to remain outside the rules.

18.   I concur with the respondent who maintains that the appellant  cannot
    bring herself within the rules because of the prohibition  on  visitors
    to 'switch' and because EX.1 is not free standing: Sabir (Appendix FM -
    EX.1 not free standing) [2014] UKUT 63 (IAC). It was  not  argued  that
    she could and I therefore proceed on the basis that this appeal  arises
    from the respondent's refusal  to  grant  discretionary  leave  to  the
    appellant.

19.   The Immigration Rules now in force are to be  read  as  incorporating
    article 8 but of course there may be matters which are not  covered  by
    Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE. If the appellant can show  that  there
    are non standard elements in her circumstances which  would  warrant  a
    grant of leave outside the rules, then a full Razgar  style  assessment
    shall be undertaken. However, in the absence of such circumstances  are
    established, there is no necessity to do so as all the  factors  relied
    upon will have been covered under the rules.

20.   The appellant's skeleton argument in Bundle 1 attempts to argue  that
    the factors set out at paragraph 10 are "overwhelming and exceptional".
    These are that: the appellant has two UK born  British  children  under
    ten, she lives with them and  their  father,  he  is  British,  she  is
    lawfully in the UK (by virtue of her application and  her  entry  as  a
    visitor), she is the primary carer for the children, they depend on her
    financially, physically and emotionally and  they  lived  with  her  in
    Nigeria before their entry in April 2012. I do not dispute these  facts
    apart from the place of birth of the younger child, the  contention  of
    financial dependence and the appellant's lawful presence in the UK. The
    first because the child's birth certificate and passport show that  she
    was born in Nigeria, the second because the  appellant's  own  evidence
    was that her partner was the one who financially supported  the  family
    and the third because it is the respondent's case that she gained entry
    by deception using a visit visa when her intention was to remain.  I do
    not however consider these factors can be described as overwhelming  or
    exceptional. They are quite commonplace in cases before these courts.

21.   I deal firstly with the  appellant's  entry  as  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control is in the public interest. In his undated
    witness statement (at pp. 21-24 Bundle  1),  Mr  Bhadmus  when  talking
    about his stroke in September 2011 states: "On my return to Nigeria  in
    October 2011, I witnessed two of my neighbours both are of the same age
    group with me suffered the same fate and they died  before  they  could
    get to the hospital. It was at this point that  I  took  the  pragmatic
    decision on the 1 April 2012 to return back to the UK  after  which  my
    family joined me on 21 April 2012. This is because I realised that  the
    environmental stress and threats to my life in  Nigeria  contributed  a
    great deal to my having a stroke" (at p. 22).

22.   In his statement of 1 November 2014 (pp 9-11, Bundle  2)  he  states:
    "We were advised and informed prior to our arrival in the  UK  that  we
    can switch  my  partner's  visiting  visa  to  leave  to  remain  on  a
    compassionate ground" (at p.9).

23.   It is plain to me from this evidence and the evidence at the  hearing
    where Mr Bhadmus stated that the house in Nigeria had been put  up  for
    sale before the appellant and the children came to  the  UK,  that  the
    decision to remain here permanently was made before 20  April  2012.  I
    was asked to believe that the appellant had no idea about her partner's
    plans but it is simply absurd to maintain that the appellant would  not
    have known that the house she was living in  was  on  the  market.  Her
    evidence that her partner had made his decision following admission  to
    hospital before she arrived was contradicted by his evidence.  He  made
    no reference to hospital admission or indeed any  medical  appointment,
    when questioned by Mr Jarvis and he referred to earlier advice given to
    him when he had his stroke some years ago and again in  February  2012.
    He also stated in evidence that he had decided to  stay  when  he  came
    here on 2 April.  Additionally he admitted that the plan  had  been  to
    reside here permanently before his eldest child turned six and  had  to
    be educated; the child was five when he last entered the  UK.  For  all
    these reasons I conclude that both the appellant and her  partner  knew
    full well that they planned to relocate permanently to the UK and  that
    they made a deliberate decision for the appellant to  enter  using  her
    visit visa so as  to  avoid  the  inconvenience  of  applying  for  the
    appropriate  entry  clearance.  It  follows   that   the   respondent's
    conclusion that she entered using deception is  justified.  The  public
    interest requires immigration control to be effectively maintained  and
    clearly rewarding people who set out to abuse the  immigration  law  is
    not to be encouraged.

24.   I accept that the appellant speaks English although of course she has
    not adduced the required language test certificate that  she  would  be
    required to produce if an entry clearance application were to have been
    made and I cannot make findings as to her competence. I accept that she
    is financially supported by her  partner  who  is  in  full  time  work
    notwithstanding his various ailments. Whilst I do not dispute  that  he
    has impaired vision following his stroke a few years ago, that has  not
    prevented him from continuing to carry on  with  a  normal  life,  from
    frequent intercontinental travel and from holding down a job  involving
    long hours. I do not accept that  the  presence  of  the  appellant  is
    crucial to his care.

25.   The appellant plainly has family life  with  her  partner  and  their
    children. No separate submissions were made as to a private life  here.
    The appellant's family life was however established here at a time when
    she knew that her status was precarious. Both she and her partner  were
    aware that as a visitor she was not entitled to remain permanently  and
    instead of abiding by the rules and applying for the appropriate  entry
    clearance, the appellant chose to  disregard  the  law  and  remain  in
    defiance of it. The statute requires me to  give  little  weight  to  a
    family life built up in such circumstances.

26.   I am, however, also required to take account of  the  fact  that  the
    public interest does not require the removal of a parent where it would
    be unreasonable for the children to leave  the  UK.  I  agree  with  Mr
    Jarvis that this sub section does not operate as  an  amnesty  for  all
    those here with children. It is a consideration that is to be  afforded
    weight and is to be considered with all the other relevant factors. The
    children are British but  they  are  also  young  and  have  spent  the
    majority of their lives in Nigeria where they lives until April 2012. I
    do not consider that it would be unreasonable to expect them  to  leave
    the UK for a temporary period with their mother whilst she  regularises
    her stay. They would be returning to a familiar environment and despite
    what Mr Bhadmus stated about their  education,  a  short  absence  from
    school at their ages would not  cause  any  lasting  damage.  There  is
    certainly nothing in the evidence to  support  Ms  Hannan's  submission
    that it would affect their  development.    Alternatively,  they  could
    remain here and arrangements for childcare could be made.

27.   Financial difficulties are pleaded but given the untruths  that  have
    been told, I am not satisfied that I can rely on the oral  evidence  of
    either the appellant or her partner in this respect. They appear to  be
    in a comfortable position where according to the documentary  evidence,
    75% of the purchase price of their  UK  house  (in  October  2012)  was
    funded by funds from abroad leaving it necessary to obtain  a  mortgage
    for just the remaining 25% (�31,790 in October 2014) over a term  of  8
    yrs and 11 months as at April 2014 and with modest  monthly  repayments
    of �362.  The family also benefit from work and child tax  credits  and
    child benefit which amount to close to �1000  per  month.  Although  Mr
    Bhadmus claimed these would cease if the children left, he conceded  no
    enquiries had been made as to whether a temporary absence from  the  UK
    would have the result he claimed.  Whilst  initially  claiming  he  had
    �40,000 in savings, he then changed this to �600. Yet plainly there  is
    sufficient money to fund regular trips abroad with several having  been
    undertaken since  Mr  Bhadmus  came  here  in  2012.  Mr  Bhadmus  also
    initially attempted to conceal the presence of two siblings in Nigeria.
    I am therefore not satisfied that the truth has been told  with  regard
    to the family circumstances there.
28.   A claim is made in written evidence that it would not be safe for the
    children in Nigeria. There is no evidence to support  such  a  sweeping
    claim and indeed it is difficult to give it credence  when  the  family
    chose to base themselves in  Nigeria  for  several  years  despite  the
    option of relocating to the UK. There has  never  been  any  suggestion
    that they encountered any problems there.

29.   The appellant has placed herself in this position because of  choices
    she made. She came here as a visitor knowing that she was not permitted
    to settle and then made an  application  to  remain  within  four  days
    rather than applying to enter as a spouse. It is in the public interest
    to ensure that visitors do not seek settlement through  the  back  door
    without any assessment of their ability to meet the language and  other
    requirements. The presence of children, though a weighty factor, is not
    a trump card and they are not being forced to leave.   The  prohibition
    on switching is there for a reason. Those who abuse the rules ought not
    to be rewarded  unless  there  is  something  compelling  otherwise  it
    promotes abuse of the system.  Having  considered  all  the  factors  I
    therefore conclude that the factors pleaded for the appellant  are  not
    compelling enough to warrant a grant of leave outside the rules.

30.   Essentially, as I stated before when setting aside  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge, this is a run of the  mill  case  of  an
    appellant with a partner and children who seeks to bypass the rules and
    to stay knowing  that  her  visa  did  not  entitled  her  to  make  an
    application within the rules. Even acknowledging that in some cases the
    public  interest  does  not  require  a  parent  to  be  removed,   the
    circumstances do not disclose that this is a special case.

Decision

31.   I set aside and re-make  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge. The appeal is dismissed on all grounds.
