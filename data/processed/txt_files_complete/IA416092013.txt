Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: In person

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant in these proceeding is the Secretary of  State.  However,
    for convenience I refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. Thus, the appellant is a citizen of China who  was  born
    on 15th April 1991.

 2. On 21st August 2013 she made an in-time application for  further  leave
    to remain as a Tier 4 Student Migrant. The course for which she  sought
    further leave was an  MA  in  International  Business  and  English  at
    Portsmouth University.

 3. In order to succeed  in  her  application  she  needed,  amongst  other
    things, to show evidence of  sufficient  funds.   The  funds  that  she
    needed to show amounted to �10,400 which consisted of  course  fees  of
    �8,800 and maintenance of �1,600,  making  a  total  of  �10,400.   Her
    application was refused and  her  appeal  against  that  decision  came
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley who dealt with the appeal  'on
    the papers' on 3rd February 2014, and whereby she allowed the appeal.

 4. Judge Ransley referred to the requirements of the immigration rules  in
    terms of funds and she was aware that  the  appellant  needed  to  show
    funds of �10,400, although she miscalculated the amount of  outstanding
    course fees stating at [14] of the determination  that  it  was  �8,000
    that was needed.  However,  that  slip  is  not  material.   The  judge
    referred to the restriction on post-application evidence  contained  in
    Section 85A(3) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    ("the 2002 Act").  The effect of that provision is that the evidence to
    show sufficient funds or maintenance is  evidence  that  needed  to  be
    submitted at the time of making the application.  Post-application, and
    certainly post-decision evidence, was not admissible and the judge  was
    not entitled  to  take  it  into  account.   In  the  appellant's  bank
    statements she did not show, certainly in terms of  the  evidence  that
    was submitted to the Secretary of State, that  she  had  the  necessary
    funds of �10,400.  She had two accounts. One is described as  an  "easy
    saver" account with Lloyds  TSB,  and  the  other  is  described  as  a
    "classic" account.

 5. Some time before the application, on 19th July 2013, a sum  of  �17,000
    was transferred from her classic account into the easy  saver  account.
    The effect of that was that the funds in the classic account which  was
    the account that was submitted in support of the  application  did  not
    show the requisite funds.  That  only  showed  funds  no  greater  than
    �4025.20 during the relevant period.   On appeal the judge was provided
    with evidence that showed that the reality was that at the time of  the
    application the appellant did have sufficient funds,  albeit  that  she
    did not evidence them in the account used to support  the  application.
    The immigration rules require her to have evidenced those funds at  the
    time of the application, which she did not do.  Judge  Ransley  allowed
    the appeal on the basis that the appellant had  sufficient  funds,  but
    ignoring the restriction in Section 85A(3) of the 2002 Act.

 6. I am satisfied that in  taking  into  account  evidence  that  was  not
    submitted in support of the application, the First-tier Judge erred  in
    law, and that that error of law is such as to require the  decision  to
    be set aside to be re-made.  No purpose  is  served  in  remitting  the
    appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  when  no  further  fact-finding  is
    required.

 7. In re-making the decision I am bound to conclude that the appellant has
    not established that she met the requirements of the Rules  as  at  the
    date of application or decision,  because  she  did  not  evidence  the
    necessary funds in support of the application, although I  accept  that
    the reality was  that  she  did  in  fact  have  the  necessary  funds.
    Nevertheless, the appeal under the immigration rules must be dismissed.

 8. Judge Ransley did not consider Article 8 of the European Convention  on
    Human Rights (ECHR) but this was understandable because she allowed the
    appeal under the immigration rules.   In  the  grounds  of  appeal  the
    appellant does not refer directly to Article 8 of  the  ECHR,  but  she
    does refer to matters which I think could  be  interpreted  as  raising
    that as an issue, namely the amount of money that  has  been  spent  on
    pursuing her education and her wish to complete the course.

 9. In considering Article 8 I adopt the structured  approach  set  out  in
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  I accept that the appellant has private life in
    the UK, albeit that her private life is  limited:  it  seems  that  she
    arrived in July 2012.  It is probably just possible  to  say  that  the
    respondent's decision amounts to an interference with that private life
    and that that interference will have consequence  of  such  gravity  as
    potentially to engage the operation of Article 8. The interference does
    nevertheless pursue a legitimate aim and it is in accordance  with  the
    law.

10. Next for consideration is the issue of proportionality.  I am unable to
    conclude that the decision is a disproportionate interference with  the
    appellant's private life.  Apart from anything else, there is  precious
    little evidence in relation to her private life, although I accept that
    she has private life here, probably limited to the studies that she has
    undertaken and her engagement with the course.  She probably does  have
    friends here and she probably has a social life, but on  the  basis  of
    her wish to complete her education, even though she has embarked on the
    course, I am unable to find that the decision of the  respondent  is  a
    disproportionate interference with that private  life.   The  appellant
    told me that she took her exams in May of this year.   She  is  waiting
    for the results.  She also told me  that  she  has  a  dissertation  to
    complete before the end of the course  and  the  course  ends  on  30th
    September 2014.  I asked the appellant whether she was able to continue
    the course from China but she did not know.

11. There is also no evidence before me in relation to whether she would be
    able or permitted by the university to continue her  dissertation  even
    if, as a result of her appeal  being  dismissed,  she  has  no  further
    leave. Even if not, that does not render the decision disproportionate.



12. There is a removal decision under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.  It is of course up to the Secretary of State
    what steps are taken, if any, to enforce removal before the appellant's
    course is completed.  That again is not a matter over which I can  have
    any control.  It may well be that the Secretary of State will  bear  in
    mind the fact that the appellant did have the necessary  funds,  albeit
    that she did not comply with the immigration rules in evidencing  those
    funds. Nevertheless, this is not a case where the appellant is short of
    funds for the completion of her course.

13. In summary, I am satisfied that the respondent's decision to refuse  to
    vary leave to remain and to remove under section 47 of the 2006 Act  is
    a proportionate response to the legitimate aim pursued,  and  does  not
    amount to a disproportionate interference with the appellant's right to
    private life.

14. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law.  I set aside the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and re-make the decision by dismissing  the  appeal
    under the immigration rules and under Article 8 of the ECHR.
