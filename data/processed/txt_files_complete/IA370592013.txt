For the Appellant: Mr Smart - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent: her sponsor Mr Lamb.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination
        of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ghani promulgated on 17  January  2014
        in which he allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules  against
        the decision of the Secretary of State dated 23 September  2013  to
        refuse to grant leave to enter under paragraph 43 of the Rules.


     2. Ms Lemieux is a Canadian national who was born on  the  20  January
        1978. She sought leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  as  a  family
        visitor for a period of one to two years to join  her  partner,  Mr
        Lamb, whilst waiting for the Canadian authorities  to  approve  his
        application for residency in Canada.


     3. Ms Lemieux and Mr Lamb met in  New  Zealand  in  2004.   They  have
        maintained their relationship and on 26  November  2010  had  their
        first child. Their second child  was  born  on  26  June  2013.   A
        conscious decision was made to relocate to Canada as a  family  and
        so they sold  their  business  in  New  Zealand.   Whilst  awaiting
        authorisation from the Canadian authorities they travelled  to  the
        United Kingdom to spend time with Mr Lamb's parents.


     4. The notice of refusal of leave to enter contains the following:


     " You have asked for leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  as  a  family
   visitor    for one to two years to join  your  partner  Anthony  McKenzie
   Lamb (GBR)     whilst your await the Canadian authorities to approve  his
   application for     residency in Canada. You have sought admission for  a
   period in excess of     six  months.  As  a  Canadian  national  you  are
   required to hold entry  clearance for a period of six months or more  and
   you have no entry   clearance. I therefore refuse leave  under  paragraph
   43 (1a) of HC 395."


     5. Removal directions were set in  the  same  document  to  remove  Ms
        Lemieux and the children, who had been refused permission in  line,
        to Montrï¿½al.  The Judge checked in the hearing whether  there  were
        separate appeals by the children but the  only  appeal  before  the
        First-tier Tribunal was  that  lodged  by  their  mother.   In  the
        children's removal notices it is stated that they are  New  Zealand
        nationals.


     6. A limited right of appeal was granted on the basis the decision was
        taken on the grounds Ms Lemieux did not  have  an  entry  clearance
        valid for the purpose for which her application for leave to  enter
        was made.


     7. An appeal was lodged challenging the  factual  basis  on  which  is
        stated Ms Lemieux was alleged to have sought  entry  clearance  for
        the  period  stated,  and  raising  human  rights  issues.   On  28
        September 2013 the Home Office wrote to her  solicitors  certifying
        the human rights claim as being clearly unfounded under section  94
        of the 2002 Act, the effect of which is that  Ms  Lemieux  is  only
        able to exercise a right of appeal once she has left the UK against
        this decision.


     8. Having considered the evidence the Judge made a number of  findings
        which can be summarised as follows:


     i.   Although it was claimed that the two children were also appellants
              there was only one  appeal  pending  which  was  that  of  the
   appellant           herself [8].


     ii.   Under  rule  16  (1)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
     (Procedure) Rules 2005 , if the Secretary of State  or  an  immigration
     officer issues a certificate under section 97 or 98  of  the  2002  Act
          which relates to a pending appeal, he must file a  notice  of  the
           certification  on  the  Tribunal.  The  Judge  noted   from   the
     documentation that the notice of appeal  is  dated  27  September  2013
     whereas the letter certifying the claim is 28 September 2013.  As  this
     post dates the notice of appeal the Judge found he was unable  to  hear
     the substantive appeal [9].


     iii. The appellant is a Canadian national and does not require  a  visa
     prior to entry to the UK providing she does not intend to  remain  here
     for more than six months. Material on the Secretary of State's  website
          regarding long-term visas valid for one to five years states  that
   if  a            long-term  visa  is  granted  an  applicant  is  allowed
   unlimited entry to           the UK at the time the visa  is  valid,  but
   for a maximum of  six  months            on  each  visit.  The  appellant
   genuinely believed she could apply for a            period  of  up  to  2
   years. Correspondence received from Mr Lamb and              his  parents
   made  it  difficult  to   conclude   that   the   appellant's   intention
   in her own right was to remain for two  years.  The  letters  from  third
     parties reflected their desire. There had  to  be  distinction  between
     wish and  intention.  The  appellant  said  she  told  the  immigration
   officer that if she is granted six months and that is all she is  allowed
          that would be  "okay".  The  record  of  interview  has  not  been
   produced            and  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  is  given  to  the
   appellant on the basis           there was a genuine misunderstanding  of
   the information relating to            family  visitors  and  immigration
   officers should therefore have                exercised discretion in the
   appellant's favour and granted six months              leave  on  arrival
   at the airport [11].




     9. The Secretary of State sought permission  to  appeal  alleging  the
        Judge had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal as Ms Lemieux did  not
        have an in country right of appeal on the ground that the  decision
        was not in accordance  with  the  immigration  rules.  It  is  also
        alleged the judge  erred  in  finding  he  could  hear  the  appeal
        substantively on the basis of the certification.



Preliminary issue


    10. A preliminary issue arose relating  to  whether  the  Secretary  of
        State's application was in time or not. Permission had been granted
        by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley but it is not clear  from  the
        decision whether the time point was taken and, if  the  application
        is out of time, such a grant can  only  operate  as  a  conditional
        grant.


    11. The Secretary  of  State's  application  of  permission  to  appeal
        omitted the portion of the form providing an  explanation  for  why
        the application was one day late. Mr Smart  accepted  that  receipt
        was governed by the procedure rules and that  having  received  the
        determination the Secretary of State did all she could  to  process
        it efficiently, but it was not  faxed  to  the  Tribunal  until  28
        January 2014 whereas it should have been sent on the 27th.  Mr Lamb
        opposed any extension claiming that the Secretary of State had  had
        sufficient time and that it would be unfair  to  extend  time  now,
        especially in light of a  further  intervening  event  in  that  Ms
        Lemieux left the United Kingdom voluntarily to return to Canada.


    12. I considered the explanation for the delay and Mr Lamb's  objection
        and have followed  the  guidance  provided  in  BO  (Nigeria)  when
        considering applications  of  this  nature.   I  find  in  all  the
        circumstances, including the overriding objectives,  the  interests
        of justice, and  fairness,  that  it  is  appropriate  in  all  the
        circumstances to extend the time in which the  Secretary  of  State
        may file her challenge the First-tier Tribunal decision.




Error of law finding


    13. I find the Judge has erred in law  in  a  manner  material  to  his
        decision to allow the appeal and now give my reasons.


    14. Although the Judge cannot be faulted  for  giving  Ms  Lemieux  the
        benefit of the doubt in the absence of the record  of  interview  I
        have now seen that document, which is  admitted,  and  which  shows
        that she clearly stated to the Immigration Officer that she  wished
        to remain in the United Kingdom for a period of one to  two  years.
        This is the period it was  believed  it  would  take  the  Canadian
        authorities to process Mr Lamb's application to enable  the  family
        to settle there.


    15. The notice of refusal of leave to enter  specifically  states  that
        any right of appeal was limited under section 88 of the  20002  Act
        because the decision was taken on the basis Ms Lemieux did not have
        entry clearance valid for the purpose for which her application for
        leave to enter was made. Section 88 specifically prevents a  person
        appealing under section 82  (1)  against  an  immigration  decision
        taken on the grounds that he or she is seeking to be in the  United
        Kingdom for a period greater than that permitted in his or her case
        by the Immigration Rules (88 (2) (c)) or is  seeking  to  enter  or
        remain for a purpose other than one for which entry is permitted in
        accordance with the Rules (88 (2) (d)). Whilst  subsection  2  does
        not prevent an appeal being bought on any of the  grounds  referred
        to in section 84 (1) (b) (c) and (g), which includes an  appeal  on
        human rights grounds, this element was certified  by  the  decision
        maker as being 'clearly unfounded' under section  94  of  the  2002
        Act.


    16. There was no challenge to the decision by way  of  judicial  review
        and I find that section 88 specifically prevented  the  Judge  from
        considering the merits of the appeal under the Rules  and  that  in
        doing so he made a material misdirection of law.


    17. In relation to the human rights appeal, the Judge refers to rule 16
        of the 2005 Procedure Rules but that is not correct  as  this  rule
        relates to claims certified under section 97 and 98 of the 2002 Act
        whereas Ms Lemieux's human rights claim is certified under  section
        94.   This  is  a   'clearly   unfounded'   certification   not   a
        certification on grounds of national security or other  grounds  of
        public good. There was no challenge to the certification by way  of
        judicial review and the effect of such certification  is  that  any
        right of appeal has to be exercised out of country.


    18. The error  in  relation  to  the  certification  is,  however,  not
        material as the judge concluded that he  was  unable  to  hear  the
        substantive appeal which is legally correct for  at  that  time  Ms
        Lemieux was still in the United Kingdom.


    19. I set aside  the  decision  of  Judge  Ghani.   Only  the  findings
        regarding the family relationship and immigration history shall  be
        preserved.




Discussion



    20. In moving on to remake the decision it is necessary to  consider  a
        further material development, namely the fact Ms  Lemieux  has  now
        left the United Kingdom and returned to Canada.  If she had a valid
        in country right of appeal this would be lost as a  result  of  the
        effects of section 104 (4) on the grounds of statutory abandonment,
        but  she  does  not.   There  was  some  discussion  regarding  the
        consequences of her leaving in respect of this appeal which relates
        to the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.


    21. In relation to the in country appeal lodged, which  is  the  appeal
        that is being reconsidered and in respect of which the decision  is
        being remade, this was filed when  Ms  Lemieux  was  still  in  the
        United Kingdom.   Accordingly  I  find  that  the  appeal  must  be
        dismissed for want of jurisdiction on the grounds that  section  88
        prevents an appeal against the substantive decision under the Rules
        and because the human rights claim has been certified under section
        94 only providing her with a right of appeal  exercisable  'out  of
        country'.


    22. As Ms Lemieux has left  the United Kingdom it is  open  to  her  to
        lodge such an appeal, if she wishes to  still  pursue  this  avenue
        against the refusal of her claim on human rights  grounds  although
        she may need to make an application for permission to appeal to  be
        admitted out of time. In such an event the fact she is  a  litigant
        in person who has acted without evidence of malice or an attempt to
        circumvent the immigration rules for  fraudulent  purposes  and  to
        have pursued an appeal which lacked jurisdiction as a result  of  a
        lack of understanding of the relevant law may be issues  that  need
        to be drawn to the attention of the tribunal in the section of  the
        application which allows an individual  to  explain  why  they  are
        seeking permission to appeal out of time.


    23. In relation to the children,  they  are  said  to  be  New  Zealand
        nationals although they  have  been  born  to  a  British  national
        father.  It may be open to them to apply  for  British  nationality
        or, possibly joint British/Canadian nationality  if  this  is  what
        their parents wish.  I make this comment as an observation  and  no
        more without having researched in any  depth  the  nationality  law
        relating to Canada and the UK and whether such dual nationality  is
        permitted. If the children have British citizenship there can be no
        requirement for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  so  far  as
        they are concerned. If this avenue is  to  be  pursued  it  may  be
        advisable for proper legal advice to be taken.


Decision

    24. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. There is nothing extant before the Upper Tribunal for want
        of jurisdiction.


   Anonymity.


    25. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.


   Fee Award.


   Note: this is not part of the determination.


    26. In light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
        finding there is not jurisdiction to consider the  appeal,  I  have
        considered whether to make a fee award (rule  23A  (costs)  of  the
        Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and  section
        12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007). I have
        had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note: Fee  Awards  in
        Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


          I make no fee award as Ms Lemieux never had an in country right of
   appeal.
