Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Schwenk of Counsel instructed by Powell Spencer &
Partners
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant entered the  United  Kingdom  on  January  26,  2018  and
    claimed asylum the same day. The respondent refused his application for
    protection under paragraphs 336 and 339M/339F HC 395 on July 25, 2018.

 2. The appellant appealed this decision on August 9,  2018  under  section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  arguing  he
    would be detained and tortured by the authorities if  returned  to  the
    Democratic Republic of Congo.

 3. The appellant's appeal was heard by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Foudy on November 15, 2018 and in a decision  promulgated  on  November
    22, 2018 the Judge dismissed his appeal on protection and human  rights
    grounds.

 4. Permission to appeal was sought on December 6, 2018 and  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Hodgkinson found it was arguable there had been  an
    error in law because (a) the Judge failed to demonstrate that  she  had
    had regard to a communication purporting to be from a  lawyer;  (b)  it
    was unclear what inconsistency the Judge relied upon in relation to his
    account of his escape and (c) the Judge also mistakenly concluded  that
    Fran�ois actually  paid  for  the  appellant's  travel  to  the  United
    Kingdom.

 5. No anonymity direction is made.

    Submissions

 6. Mr Schwenk adopted the grounds of appeal and submitted that  there  had
    been an error in law. The circumstances at the  original  hearing  were
    unusual  in  that  the  appellant  had  not  obtained  translations  of
    documents that he  sought  to  rely  on.  The  Judge  had  allowed  the
    appellant to read two documents in  French  and  the  interpreter  then
    translated what he said. Mr Schwenk submitted the Judge failed to  take
    into account an email that was purported to have come  from  a  lawyer,
    Robert Makiese, in the DRC. He further submitted that the inconsistency
    referred to in  paragraph  16  of  the  Judge's  decision  was  not  an
    inconsistency  as  the  appellant  was  simply   providing   additional
    information. Finally, the Judge had wrongly  found  that  Fran�ois  had
    paid for the appellant's travel to the United Kingdom. The  grounds  of
    appeal also highlighted gender and spelling errors which taken together
    amounted to an error in law.

 7. Mr Tan  submitted  there  was  no  error  in  law.  The  situation  was
    unsatisfactory at the original hearing because the appellant had failed
    to have documentation translated prior to the hearing but to avoid  any
    injustice or delay the Judge had allowed the appellant to read out what
    was in the documents and the interpreter had translated what  he  said.
    Whilst the Judge did not make reference to the email, he submitted that
    that email took the case no further and there was  no  material  error.
    The Judge assessed other documents in paragraph 18 of her decision  and
    made findings open to her.  With  regard  to  inconsistencies,  Mr  Tan
    submitted that the account given in his interview  was  different  from
    the account the appellant had subsequently relied  on.  The  Judge  had
    made a number of unchallenged findings in paragraph 16 of her decision.
    Whilst he accepted that Fran�ois had  never  stated  he  paid  for  the
    appellant to come to the United Kingdom he submitted this error,  along
    with spelling and gender mistakes, did not amount to an error in law.

 8. Mr Schwenk made the point that the appellant had been unable to  obtain
    translations because he could not find a legal aid solicitor willing to
    take his case. There had been a direct challenge to paragraph 18 of the
    Judge's decision on the basis the  reasoning  was  inadequate,  and  he
    reiterated the Judge had made no reference to  the  letters  that  were
    contained  in  the  appellant's  bundle  or  the  fact  Robert  Makiese
    confirmed there were outstanding warrants.

 9. I reserved my decision.

    Findings

10. The appellant filed his own grounds of appeal in which  he  took  issue
    with the Judge's findings about his case. Whilst Mr Tan  accepts  there
    were errors he submitted that none of the errors were material  to  the
    overall decision.

11. Unusually at the hearing the Judge allowed the interpreter to translate
    documents that  appeared  before  her  untranslated.  The  Tribunal  in
    Thevaras [2002] UKIAT 06146 suggested that the documents should not  be
    translated by the interpreter unless  they  were  short  enough  to  be
    translated on the spot and important enough to require  translation  in
    the interests of justice and unless an acceptable explanation for  late
    production and lack of service had been provided.

12. On checking the Court record, I note that the Judge made  it  clear  to
    the appellant that it was not the role of the interpreter to  translate
    a document, and seemingly without objection from either party,  allowed
    the interpreter to translate the appellant's spoken words.

13. The document at page B11, translated in  the  manner  described  above,
    referred to the appellant's name and stated that if he  was  discovered
    or seen he had to be brought to the police. The  interpreter  confirmed
    the words in the document made no  reference  to  it  being  an  arrest
    warrant but translated as an invitation to attend at the police station
    to answer questions.

14. The email that had been sent by Robert Makiese on November 12, 2018 had
    also been translated  in  a  similar  manner.  The  Judge's  record  of
    proceedings recorded that the email  was  not  directed  at  anyone  in
    particular and invited an unnamed person to attend to answer questions.
    In other words, the email confirmed very little and did not confirm the
    authenticity of the document at B11 or  suggest  there  was  an  arrest
    warrant out for the appellant.

15. The Judge went on to consider the letter provided  by  the  appellant's
    sister but  again  this  had  not  been  translated  by  an  authorised
    translator albeit  there  was  a  "google  translate"  translation.  At
    paragraph 18 of her decision, the Judge pointed out that  the  document
    had not been independently translated and that  therefore  reduced  the
    weight she can attach to it  and  made  a  finding  that  the  document
    referred to by the appellant's sister was not an arrest warrant despite
    the fact the appellant was supposedly a fugitive  from  Makala  prison.
    The Judge did not find credible that the authorities would simply issue
    a letter asking to him to be taken to a police  station  if  he  was  a
    fugitive. Such a finding was open to her.

16. The Judge considered the evidence regarding his escape from prison  and
    at paragraph 16 the Judge made a  number  of  findings  which  included
    findings of incredulity that the chief at the prison would do what  was
    claimed or that Fran�ois would risk his family, career and life to help
    a stranger escape from prison. Although  there  was  no  evidence  that
    Fran�ois had paid for either the  appellant's  false  passport  or  his
    travel tickets nevertheless the evidence presented by the appellant was
    that  Fran�ois  had  sorted  everything.  When  assessed  against   the
    background of the appellant's account I am satisfied the  finding  that
    Fran�ois paid for everything was not a material error.

17. With regard to the submission that the Judge failed to have  regard  to
    the email, I find that the Judge was aware of the email.  I  accept  Mr
    Tan's submission that the email added little to the evidence because it
    did not contain important information and was simply  a  document  that
    referred to other documents. I am satisfied that the failure to make  a
    finding on the document was not an error in law  because  the  evidence
    contained within the document would not  have  impacted  on  the  other
    evidence.

18.  When  considering  the  appellant's  escape.  the   Judge   identified
    differences in the evidence, and she assessed his whole  account  about
    his escape and found the claim lacked credibility and she gave numerous
    reasons for that conclusion.  Despite  Mr  Schwenk's  best  efforts  to
    suggest otherwise the grounds of appeal did not challenge other adverse
    findings.

19. Taking all the matters into account I do not find  there  has  been  an
    error in law.
