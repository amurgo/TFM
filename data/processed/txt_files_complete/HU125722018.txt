For the Respondent:    Ms Jones, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of Mr Hardeep Singh, a national of India born on  15
    March 1982.  His appeal came before the Upper Tribunal for an error  of
    law hearing on 3 May 2019.  In a decision and reasons promulgated on 20
    May 2019, I found an error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and adjourned the appeal for a resumed hearing with directions
    that the appeal be confined to consideration  of  whether  or  not  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules and Appendix FM-SE were
    met.

     Hearing

 2. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, Mr  Raza  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant submitted a skeleton argument and  also  printouts  from  the
    Sponsor's savings account. In  respect  of  the  current  balance,  the
    Santander account  showed  a  current  balance  of  �4,969.76  and  the
    Barclay's ISA account showed a balance of �10,124.53.

 3. The Sponsor gave evidence and adopted her statement signed by  her  and
    dated 28 June 2019, in which she  refers  to  the  fact  that  she  has
    changed employment and now  works  for  SSV  Logistics  Limited  as  an
    administrator receiving a monthly gross salary of  �1,650.00  which  is
    paid directly into her bank account.   She  was  cross-examined  by  Ms
    Jones on behalf of the Secretary of State.  I  then  heard  submissions
    from both parties as to the ability of the Sponsor to meet the Rules.

     Findings and Reasons

 4. It was ultimately agreed by the parties  that  the  material  Rule  was
    Appendix FM-SE(n).  This provides as follows:

         "(m) Cash income on which the correct tax  has  been  paid  may  be
             counted as income under this Appendix, subject to the relevant
             evidential requirements of this Appendix.

         (n)  The gross amount of any cash income may be counted  where  the
             person's specified bank statements show the net  amount  which
             relates to the gross amount shown on their pay  slips  (or  in
             the relevant specified evidence provided in  addition  to  the
             specified  bank  statements  in  relation  to   non-employment
             income).  Otherwise only the net amount shown on the specified
             bank statements may be counted."

 5. Ms Jones submitted that the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE  were  not
    met, thus the Appellant was unable to meet the financial requirement of
    the Rules and consequently the appeal fell to be dismissed.   She  drew
    attention to the fact that  the  schedule  of  income  which  had  been
    prepared by the Appellant's solicitors at page 16 of the updated bundle
    was inaccurate, in that it was claimed in respect of November 2018 that
    �1,350.00 had been deposited, but this was not reflected  by  the  bank
    statement relating to that time period and the Sponsor's  evidence  was
    that she had gone to India  that  month  and  that  her  employers  had
    instead provided her with �1,200.00 in cash which she  had  taken  with
    her in order to help support her father-in-law in India who was ill  at
    that time.

 6. The second discrepancy relates to  March  2019  where  the  Appellant's
    income for that month was �1,200.04.  However it  was  claimed  in  the
    schedule that �1,400.00 was deposited whereas the bank  statements  and
    the pay slips show instead that  �1,200.04  was  deposited.   Thus  the
    schedule of income is incorrect.

 7. Ms Jones also drew attention to the  fact  that,  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant's new employment, pay slips in respect of which are  set  out
    at pages 22 and 23, the taxable gross pay does not seem to reflect  the
    amounts that the Appellant has actually been paid, i.e. for  the  first
    working month of March 2019 the Appellant was paid �1,200.04,  but  her
    taxable gross pay was �1,350.00.  The following month in April 2019 she
    was paid �1,416.00, her total payment being �1,650.00,  but  for  May's
    pay slip her total payment was �1,575.00, but her taxable gross pay was
    �3,225.00.  However it seems in respect of this  calculation  that  the
    taxable gross pay has been calculated from the beginning of April  thus
    I do not consider that that is discrepant, having looked at the figures
    that have been provided.

 8. In his submissions, Mr Raza accepted ultimately that  the  requirements
    of Appendix FM-SE were not strictly complied with, but in substance the
    requirements of the Rules in terms of the  minimum  income  requirement
    are met,  particularly  when  one  takes  into  account  the  Sponsor's
    savings.  Mr Raza submitted that the relevant period began  on  5  June
    2018, when the Sponsor had her previous employment.  Evidence  of  that
    is at page 17 onwards of the bundle and it ends with the pay  slips  at
    page 23, ending on 31 May 2019.  He submitted that the gross total  for
    that period amounts to �19,425.00 taken from the pay slips. In  respect
    of the Sponsor's previous employment with PR Distributions Limited,  he
    accepted that there was no deposit of salary in November 2018 and  thus
    there was a small shortfall based on the pay slips.  Mr Raza  submitted
    that subparagraph (n) of Appendix  FM-SE  is  discretionary.   The  pay
    slips for PR Distributions show that the Sponsor was paid in cash, that
    there was no dispute that this employment was genuine  and  the  reason
    for the shortfall was the Sponsor's visit to India  in  November  2018.
    He invited  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  read  the  Immigration  Rules  in
    conjunction with the judgment of the  Supreme  Court  in  MM  (Lebanon)
    [2017] UKSC 10 at [99] to [100] cited  in  his  skeleton  argument  and
    which provides as follows:

         "99. Operation of the same restrictive approach outside  the  rules
             is a different matter and in our view is much  more  difficult
             to  justify  under  the  HRA.   This  is  not  because   'less
             intrusive' methods might be devised (as Blake J  attempted  to
             do: para  147),  but  because  it  is  inconsistent  with  the
             character of evaluation which article 8 requires.  As has been
             seen, avoiding a financial burden on the state can be relevant
             to the  fair  balance  required  by  the  article.   But  that
             judgment cannot properly be constrained by a rigid restriction
             in  the  rules.   Certainly,  nothing  that  is  said  in  the
             instructions to case officers  can  prevent  the  tribunal  on
             appeal from looking at the matter more broadly.  These are not
             matters of policy on which special weight has to  be  accorded
             to the judgment of the Secretary of State.  There  is  nothing
             to prevent the tribunal, in the context  of  the  HRA  appeal,
             from judging for itself the  reliability  of  any  alternative
             sources of finance in the light of the evidence before it.  In
             doing so, it will no doubt take account of such considerations
             as those discussed by Lord  Brown  and  Lord  Kerr  in  Mahad,
             including  the  difficulties  of  proof  highlighted  in   the
             quotation from Collins J.  That being the position before  the
             tribunal, it would make little sense  for  decision-makers  at
             the earlier stages to be forced to take  a  narrower  approach
             which they might be unable to defend on appeal.


         100. As already explained, we do not see this as an issue going  to
             the legality of the rules as such.  What is necessary is  that
             the guidance to officers should make  clear  that,  where  the
             circumstances give rise to a positive article 8  duty  in  the
             sense  explained  in  Jeunesse,  a  broader  approach  may  be
             required  in  drawing  the  'fair  balance'  required  by  the
             Strasbourg court.  They are entitled to take  account  of  the
             Secretary of State's policy objectives, but in judging whether
             they are met, they are not precluded from  taking  account  of
             other reliable sources of earnings or finance.  It is open  to
             the  Secretary  of  State  to  indicate  criteria   by   which
             reliability of such sources may be judged, but not to  exclude
             them altogether."

     Decision

 9. I have concluded in light of the evidence and the submissions  of  both
    parties, that the Sponsor is not able to meet the specific requirements
    of Appendix FM-SE due to her visit to India in November  2018  and  the
    absence of her salary being deposited that  month.  However,  following
    the judgment of the Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon) when one looks at the
    matter in the round and in particular take  account  not  only  of  the
    Sponsor's payslips but also her Barclay's ISA account and the Santander
    savings account, that the minimum income requirement of  the  Rules  is
    met. It follows that the appeal falls to be allowed cf.  TZ  (Pakistan)
    [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 at [34], that being the only  issue  that  was  in
    contention before the Upper Tribunal.
