For the Appellant:     Mr B Criggie, of Hamilton Burns WS
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Bannerman, promulgated on 6 September 2016, dismissing his appeal
    against deportation under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.

 2. Ground 1 says that  the  judge  made  important  findings  without  the
    appropriate evidence being available. It was raised "as  a  preliminary
    issue" that medical records requested by the appellant from the GP  had
    not yet been provided, and that an adjournment to give time to  produce
    them had previously been granted.  It was  an  important  part  of  the
    appellant's case that brain surgery in 2009 badly affected his  memory.
    The judge  accepted  that  he  had  such  surgery  but  not  that  this
    difficulty was the cause of poor memory and depression. The judge  went
    on to make adverse credibility  findings  but  provided  "virtually  no
    reasoning", and referred to the lack of medical evidence  and  lack  of
    evidence about residence in the UK,  in  spite  of  evidence  that  the
    appellant's former landlords disposed of his belongings while he was in
    custody.  The  judge  did  not  explain  why  this   was   "incredible"
    (paragraphs 50 and 51). In dismissing the appellant's evidence  despite
    accepting that he underwent brain surgery the judge "acted unreasonably
    and has not provided adequate reasoning".

 3. Ground 2 says that the judge failed to apply the "appropriate test". It
    was argued that the appellant had been in the  UK  for  over  10  years
    (since 2004) and so his deportation was to be justified on "imperative"
    grounds of  public  security  or  public  policy,  "an  extremely  high
    threshold". The judge found that the appellant had been resident  since
    2006, and not for 10 years.  The  judge  should  have  found  that  the
    appellant had acquired a right of permanent residence, by virtue of the
    fact that he had certainly been resident for over  5  years.  The  test
    would then have been whether there were  "serious"  grounds  of  public
    policy or public security, to which the  judge  had  been  referred  in
    submissions (paragraph 32). The judge  appeared  to  simply  apply  the
    "base" test laid down in regulation 21, and so "erred fundamentally".

 4. Ground 3 says that as an adjunct to the error set out in ground  2  the
    judge failed appropriately to address  the  issue  of  proportionality.
    While the appellant had a number  of  convictions,  only  latterly  had
    these  resulted  in  custodial  sentences.  They  were  all  linked  to
    relatively minor offences and cumulatively earned only short  custodial
    sentences, mostly related to failure to obtemper bail conditions or  to
    attend court. The judge made much of a  further  conviction  under  the
    Misuse of Drugs Act, but the court dealt with this by way  of  a  small
    fine (ï¿½80) and it related  to  an  offence  committed  over  12  months
    previously. Against this background, there was  insufficient  reasoning
    to satisfy the assertion that  the  appellant  represented  a  "genuine
    present and sufficiently serious threat  to  the  interests  of  public
    policy", and the proportionality issue was inadequately reasoned.

 5.  Ground  4  is  that  the  judge  failed  adequately  to  consider  the
    appellant's private life in the UK. It was accepted that the  appellant
    could not show extensive family  life  but  the  tribunal  should  have
    considered his private life over a period of over 10 years. In  failing
    to take proper account of the strength of the appellant's private life,
    the judge erred in law.

 6. The submissions by Mr Criggie were along  the  lines  of  the  grounds.
    Ground 1 overlapped with ground 2. Although the  appellant  might  have
    fallen short of showing 10 years' residence, there ought to have been a
    finding of 5 years' residence, bringing in the  higher  threshold.  The
    judge failed to make his findings  in  relation  to  that  intermediate
    standard. (The respondent's decision had been made at "base" level.) If
    the higher level had been applied, the appeal would have succeeded. The
    appellant's last conviction was on 9 August  2016,  but  the  offending
    took place long before then. The offending had to be put in context  of
    the medical background.  The  appellant  had  difficulty  in  attending
    regularly as  required  at  court  and  to  comply  with  non-custodial
    sentences (and in keeping appointments with his solicitors), which  led
    into a spiral of convictions. Ground 4 was perhaps the weakest  of  the
    grounds, but an assessment was absent. The nub of  the  appeal  was  in
    ground 2, on the basis of which the outcome should be reversed.

 7. Mrs O'Brien submitted that it was unclear what was intended  by  ground
    1.  The  first-tier  tribunal  had  not  been  asked  for   a   further
    adjournment. On ground 2, there was evidence  that  the  appellant  had
    been in the UK for 5 years or more, but no evidence that  he  had  been
    here as a qualified person in accordance with the regulations  so  that
    his residence counted for these purposes. There was no evidence of  the
    capacity in which he had been here. It was plain that he had not been a
    qualified person at least since 2009, having  been  reliant  on  public
    assistance. His own evidence had been found thoroughly  unreliable,  so
    there was no basis on which findings might be made  in  his  favour  in
    respect  of  qualifying  residence.  The  judge  applied  the   correct
    threshold. The findings were all properly explained.  The  judge  might
    not have explicitly stated which threshold was to be applied, but there
    was no evidence to suggest that it should have been at  anything  above
    the "base" level, as there was no evidence the appellant  had  been  in
    the UK as a worker, as a student, or in any qualifying capacity.  There
    was therefore no error, and the decision should stand.

 8. Mr Craigie in reply said that the  evidence  before  the  judge  showed
    receipt of  benefits  only  from  2011.  Looked  at  holistically,  the
    evidence was that he had been in the UK for 11 years up to the date  of
    the hearing, and within that period  he  might  well  have  achieved  5
    years' residence in accordance with the regulations, such that his case
    should have been decided on the basis of serious grounds.

 9. I reserved my decision.

10. The appellant did not ask  for  a  further  adjournment.  No  error  is
    disclosed in respect of proceeding  without  further  medical  evidence
    being available. The judge correctly reached his  conclusions  on  such
    evidence as was placed before him.

11. In any event, it is not shown that if an adjournment been requested, it
    ought to have been granted; or that if  granted,  any  further  medical
    evidence would have emerged which might have improved the case.

12. The criticism in the grounds of paragraphs 50 and 51 of the decision is
    somewhat misleading. The judge did not  find  it  incredible  that  the
    appellant's former landlords might have  disposed  of  his  belongings.
    What the judge did find was that there was no evidence "apart from  the
    incredible and extremely vague evidence of the appellant" that  he  had
    been in the UK since 2004, and that apart from  claiming  he  had  done
    some work in the UK, it was far from clear what that work  was  and  no
    documentation, despite the lengthy period  of  time  available  to  the
    appellant to produce it, of a medical or employment nature to assist in
    understanding his movements [or activities] in the UK since arrival.

13. That is a simply a sensible finding, based on the evidence, or lack  of
    evidence, before the judge, that the appellant failed to establish  his
    case.

14. In any event, disposal of  the  appellant's  papers  while  he  was  in
    custody did not mean that he had no other way of proving  he  had  been
    employed.  He might, for example, have asked for records from employers
    or from HMRC.

15.  Ground 2 is also apt to mislead, by suggesting that the appellant  had
    only to establish residence  for  over  5  years  to  qualify  for  the
    "serious" test. As the  Presenting  Officer  pointed  out,  he  had  to
    establish also that his residence  had  been  in  accordance  with  the
    regulations.

16. Ground 3 seeks to put the best possible gloss on the appellant's series
    of convictions, and disagrees with the judge's assessment in  terms  of
    the  regulations  and   of   proportionality   assessment.   Ground   4
    optimistically suggests that there might have been a  different  result
    based on private life only. Neither  of  these  grounds  discloses  any
    error of law.

17. Neither representative took me to the evidence as to  when  receipt  of
    public benefits was first disclosed; but whether that was  in  2009  or
    2011 is neither here nor there.

18. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

19. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
