Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs Heybrook, Counsel, instructed by Carmelite
      Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Saunders (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, born June 15,  1990,  is  a  citizen  of  Mauritius.  In
    October 2005 he entered the United Kingdom as a dependant  child  under
    the Legacy programme. He was granted leave to remain  until  March  31,
    2007. On April 14, 2008 his  application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a
    dependant under the legacy programme was granted enabling him to remain
    in the United Kingdom until June 30, 2009. Further applications on June
    27 and July 16, 2009 to remain as a dependant over the age of  18  were
    rejected and on August 13,  2009  the  appellant  submitted  a  further
    application to remain as a dependant but this was rejected on  November
    22, 2010. The appellant appealed this decision on December 8, 2010  but
    a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal rejected his appeal on  February  4,
    2011. His appeal rights were exhausted on April 14, 2011.  On  May  12,
    2012 the appellant submitted an application under article  8  but  this
    was rejected on July 19, 2013 without a right of appeal. The  appellant
    applied for reconsideration of that decision and on September 11,  2013
    his application to remain on human rights grounds was reconsidered  but
    rejected and a decision to remove him as an illegal entrant was  served
    the same day.

 2. On September 24, 2013 the appellant appealed under section 82(1) of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The matter came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Sullivan
    (hereinafter referred to as "the FtTJ") on February 7, 2014  and  in  a
    determination promulgated on February 26, 2014 she dismissed his appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

 4. The appellant appealed that decision on March 7,  2014.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Garratt  on  the
    basis the FtTJ might not  have  followed  the  approach  laid  down  in
    Gulshan (Article 8-  New  Rules-Correct  Approach)  [2013]  UKUT  00640
    (IAC).

 5. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response dated May 8, 2014 arguing  that
    whilst the FtTJ did not set out the terms of the new Rules it was clear
    the FtTJ had had regard to the relevant points.

 6. The matter was listed before me on the above date and the appellant was
    in attendance.

    SUBMISSIONS

 7. Mrs Heybrook adopted the grounds of appeal and when challenged accepted
    the appellant was unable to meet the requirements of either Appendix FM
    or paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules. She submitted this was an
    exceptional case and the FtTJ had failed to give sufficient  weight  to
    the arguments put forward on his  behalf  and  had  attached  too  much
    weight to the importance of immigration  control.  In  particular,  she
    failed to attach sufficient weight  to  the  level  of  dependency  the
    appellant had on his family and  the  fact  he  would  be  returned  to
    Mauritius at a time when his whole family  were  still  living  in  the
    United Kingdom.

 8. Mr Saunders submitted the FtTJ had effectively overlooked the dictum of
    Gulshan and had immediately gone on to consider the  appellant's  claim
    under article 8 ECHR. Mrs Heybrook's arguments on "exceptionality" were
    irrelevant  in  this  appeal  because  the  FtTJ  had  considered   the
    appellant's appeal in light of Razgar [2004] UKHL 00027.  At  paragraph
    [34] the FtTJ accepted the appellant had family life and  that  removal
    would interfere with that right. At paragraph [36] the FtTJ  considered
    "legitimate purpose" and identified the public interest. At  paragraphs
    [37]  and  [38]  he  considered  proportionality   and   rejected   the
    appellant's claim. The appellant's argument today is  that  his  mother
    has leave to  remain  as  Tier  2  migrant  until  September  2014  and
    insufficient weight has been attached to that fact.  The  FtTJ  clearly
    considered this issue and found that as she only had limited  leave  to
    remain and she was a Mauritian national she could return  to  Mauritius
    with him if she wanted to. The appellant's  father  has  no  leave  and
    whilst he had an appeal listed on Monday at Taylor House Hearing Centre
    this was a fact known to  the  FtTJ  when  the  appeal  was  originally
    considered. The appeal should be dismissed.

    ERROR OF LAW FINDING

 9. The appellant's immigration history is long and has involved  a  number
    of applications. All those applications failed and on February 4,  2011
    the First-tier Tribunal rejected his appeal under the Immigration Rules
    and human rights. Permission to appeal was refused.


10. The appellant then submitted an application to remain on  private  life
    grounds. The application  was  submitted  after  the  Immigration  Rule
    changes  in  2012  and  the  respondent  considered  the  appeal  under
    paragraph 276ADE on July 19, 2013. Initially, no right  of  appeal  was
    offered but following further submissions the respondent  reviewed  the
    matter and found  there  were  no  exceptional  circumstances  meriting
    consideration of the claim outside of the  Immigration  Rules  be  that
    Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE.

11. The FtTJ considered the case on  the  basis  the  appellant  wished  to
    remain in the United Kingdom to be with his mother and  girlfriend  and
    because he had been here for almost  8  �  years.  In  considering  the
    submissions the FtTJ was aware of the following factors:

     a. The appellant claimed his ties to  his  parents  were  closer  than
        normal emotional ties.
     b. He intended to marry his girlfriend in the "not too distant future"
        and if he was removed his girlfriend  believed  their  relationship
        would break down.
     c. His mother had leave to remain until September 2014 and his  father
        had  an  appeal  in  June  2014.  His  mother  supported  him  both
        financially and emotionally.
     d. He had been here 8 � years.
     e. Reasonable likelihood his family would have to return to  Mauritius
        in the not too distant future. This was a more reasonable  solution
        to the appellant's situation.
     f. Unclear what his living conditions would be in Mauritius.

12. The FtTJ made a number of significant findings-


     a. Between paragraphs [21] and [33] the FtTJ considered the  facts  of
        the case.
     b. She noted in  paragraph  [22]  that  the  appellant  had  know  his
        immigration status had been precarious  since  June  30,  2009  (19
        years old) and since April 14, 2011 (20 � year old) he knew he  had
        no right to remain and was expected to leave.
     c. At paragraph [23] the FtTJ noted how long he had  lived  both  here
        and in Mauritius and that he had enjoyed a good education  and  had
        been able to work for three years in the United Kingdom.
     d. At paragraph [25] she noted he was in good health and she concluded
        there was no evidence he was incapable of living independently.
     e. At paragraph [26] she accepted  the  appellant  was  close  to  his
        mother and was financially dependent on her but she  was  satisfied
        his  financial  dependency,  in  particular,  was  because  of  his
        immigration status.
     f. At paragraph [27] she found there was no  such  dependency  on  his
        father.
     g. At paragraphs [28] and [29] she made  negative  findings  regarding
        the truthfulness of both the appellant's mother and the appellant.
     h. At paragraph [30] the FtTJ assessed  the  appellant's  relationship
        with his girlfriend and she  concluded  they  had  not  established
        family life.
     i. At paragraph [31] she found there was  nothing  adverse  about  his
        character, conduct or associations for the  purposes  of  paragraph
        353B HC 395.


13. I am satisfied the FtTJ carried out a full assessment of  the  evidence
    before her and made findings open to her. The FtTJ did not consider the
    appellant's appeal under either Appendix FM or  paragraph  276ADE.  Mrs
    Heybrook made it clear that she was not suggesting the appellant  could
    satisfy either Rule. In giving permission to appeal Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal  questioned  whether  the  FtTJ  should  have  considered
    whether the appellant's ties to  Mauritius  had  been  severed  because
    under paragraph 276ADE (1)(vi) he could be granted permission  to  stay
    if  "has  lived  continuously  in  the  UK  for  less  than  20   years
    (discounting any period of imprisonment) but  has  no  ties  (including
    social, cultural or family) with the country to which he would have  to
    go if required to leave the UK."


14. Mrs Heybrook did not seek to persuade me that this was the case and  it
    therefore follows from that the appellant could not demonstrate this.

15. Mrs Heybrook agreed that as  she  was  not  seeking  to  argue  he  met
    paragraph 276ADE then the  only  basis  of  challenge  was  the  FtTJ's
    approach to article 8 ECHR and in particular proportionality.

16. For the avoidance of doubt I  find  the  FtTJ  did  follow  the  Razgar
    approach and I therefore need only now consider whether the FtTJ  erred
    in her approach to proportionality.

17. As stated above the FtTJ made findings that were clearly  open  to  her
    between paragraphs [21] and [33]. Her assessment under article 8 should
    only have taken place if there  was  something  exceptional  about  the
    case. The FtTJ jumped straight to  her  article  8  assessment  without
    considering what  the  Tribunal  said  in  Gulshan.  For  the  sake  of
    completeness I remind the parties what the Tribunal has recently stated
    about the approach.

18. The Tribunal in Gulshan at paragraph [24]-

        "Drawing the threads together, and not without some difficulty,  we
        conclude that on the current state of the authorities:


        (a) ... ;


        (b) after applying the requirements of the rules, only if there may
        arguably be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  them
        is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether
        there are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised
        under them: Nagre;


        (c) the term  "insurmountable  obstacles"  in  provisions  such  as
        Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount: MF
        (Nigeria); they concern the practical possibilities of  relocation.
        In the absence of such insurmountable obstacles, if removal  is  to
        be disproportionate it is necessary to show other non-standard  and
        particular   features   demonstrating   that   removal   will    be
        unjustifiably harsh: Nagre."

19. The Tribunal stated in Shahzad (Article 8: legitimate aim) [2014]  UKUT
    00085 (IAC) at paragraph [31] :

         "Where an  area  of  the  rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)  ([29]-[31]  in  particular
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements
         of the rules, only if  there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
         purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them."

20. I do not revisit whether the FtTJ was correct to find the circumstances
    exceptional because the challenge now is  whether  having  reached  the
    stage she did she erred in her proportionality assessment. There was no
    cross appeal about her approach in any event.


21. Against this background the FtTJ considered the  article  8  claim  and
    made findings between paragraphs [34] and [38]. These findings have  to
    be read alongside the earlier findings she made. She made  findings  on
    the proportionality of removal that were clearly open to her  based  on
    her own findings. In particular, she had regard to what would happen if
    he were returned and she considered the financial and  emotional  ties.
    She did not find these ties sufficient to show "dependency" for article
    8 purposes.

22. The appellant, like his father, wishes to remain in the United Kingdom.
    His mother has leave until September 2014 and that may or  may  not  be
    extended. His father's appeal may succeed. These are factors that would
    be relevant to  the  appellant's  future  position  but  based  on  the
    evidence presented I am satisfied the FtTJ did not materially err.

    DECISION

23. There was no material error of law. The original decision stands.

24. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
