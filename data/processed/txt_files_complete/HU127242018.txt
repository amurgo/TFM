For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Ms Holmes (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is the appeal of Master  [MY],  a  citizen  of  Ghana  born  21
       December 2011, against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       (Judge Smith) of 15 January 2019  dismissing  his  appeal  on  human
       rights grounds, itself brought against  the  refusal  of  his  human
       rights claim of 10 May 2018.


    2. On 5 February 2018 the Appellant applied for leave to enter the UK as
       a child to join  his  father,  also  called  [MY],  in  the  UK.  The
       Appellant's mother is [LY]. The application was  made  on  the  basis
       that the Sponsor and his wife had decided to ease the pressure on the
       Sponsor's grandmother, [CN], who had been taking care of the  boy  in
       recent years but was getting older, suffered from a health condition,
       and found childcare increasingly difficult given that she worked. The
       application form stated "I need [M] to be with me is father  and  son
       bondage which we have not had since he was born - I only  see  him  3
       weeks in a year or two and also have  the  same  bond  with  his  big
       sister and baby brother as a father I need all my kinds to be one and
       ensure none of them get advantage over the others ..."

    3. The application was refused because there  was  no  evidence  of  the
       Sponsor's involvement in his son's  life  beyond  providing  for  him
       financially:  this  was  not  enough  to  demonstrate   either   sole
       responsibility or serious and compelling reasons rendering the  boy's
       exclusion undesirable.

    4. The Appellant wrote a further letter by way of a reply to  the  Entry
       Clearance Manager's refusal stating that his mother  was  ageing  and
       diabetic. She worked exceptionally long hours, from 5am, leaving  [M]
       alone until he started school at 7:45am; he had had reports that  his
       son rode motorbikes without a helmet, which made  him  fear  for  the
       possibility of losing his child. He always visited his  son's  school
       during his visits to Ghana to keep their bond alive, and paid  termly
       fees. He would take his son shopping, play with him, watch television
       together and play games. He worried about the boy  being  bullied  at
       school (including by the teachers: he had made arrangements to change
       his school after a teacher hit him with a book) and about his welfare
       generally. The prospective husband of [M]'s mother did  not  want  to
       foster him and he had sent his son  to  his  grandmother  because  he
       feared for his welfare.

    5. The  First-tier  Tribunal  remarked  upon  the  paucity  of  material
       supporting the appeal. The evidence showed that the  Appellant  lived
       in Ghana with his paternal grandmother. The  Sponsor  had  two  other
       children, born in the UK on 11 August 2010 and 14 November 2015.  The
       Sponsor had written a letter to the Tribunal in December 2018 stating
       that he had spent 3 weeks in Ghana with his son each year  since  the
       boy had been born.  A  statutory  declaration  from  the  Appellant's
       mother consented to him travelling to the UK.

    6. The First-tier Tribunal found that there were  discrepancies  in  the
       evidence:

      a) The statements that the Sponsor visited his son annually (in the
         letter to the Tribunal) and "3 weeks in a year or two" (in the
         application form) were inconsistent;


      b) The claim to have regularly travelled to visit his son was
         inconsistent with the Sponsor's statement that there was a lack of
         a solid bond between him and his son.

    7. Furthermore a letter from Southeastern Montessori School of  November
       2018 referred to the school fees being paid but did not  identify  by
       whom (a bill for  school  fees  of  September  2018);  there  was  no
       reference to any involvement by the  Sponsor  with  the  school.  The
       Appellant's mother's letter did not reference any involvement by  the
       Sponsor in his son's upbringing. Accordingly the First-tier  Tribunal
       rejected the Sponsor's claim that he had sole responsibility for  his
       son's upbringing; it also  found  that  there  were  no  serious  and
       compelling circumstances evinced that  would  require  the  grant  of
       entry clearance. Accordingly the refusal  of  the  Appellant's  entry
       clearance application was a  lawful  reaction  to  the  human  rights
       issues that it raised.


    8. The Sponsor drafted grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal, via  the
       First-tier Tribunal, arguing that he had  intended  to  say  that  he
       sometimes spent two weeks and sometimes three weeks with his son.  He
       would be able to produce further evidence of paying the  school  fees
       himself if required; he believed that schools in Ghana did not have a
       developed system for issuing receipts, but would nevertheless  revert
       to the school. His mother was not able to pay for  the  boy's  school
       fees or upkeep.

    9. Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  21
       February 2019 on the basis that the  "exceptionally  brief"  findings
       were arguably legally inadequate and that the  Judge  may  well  have
       erred in finding an inconsistency where in truth the evidence did not
       disclose any such thing.

   10. The Appellant did not appear before me. A letter apologised  for  his
       absence, which was said to be on account of his visiting his  son  in
       Ghana, but no adjournment application  was  made.  I  note  that  the
       appeal  was  previously  determined  without  a  hearing.  In   these
       circumstances I consider that the interests of justice  required  the
       appeal to  be  determined  in  the  Appellant's  absence.  Ms  Holmes
       submitted that there was inadequate evidence available  to  establish
       that the mother had truly relinquished parental  responsibility,  and
       that the facts underlying the application were simply too unclear for
       the Appellant's case to prevail.

  Findings and reasons

   11. I do not accept that there  was  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal for the following reasons.


   12. It is true, as the  Judge  granting  permission  remarked,  that  the
       reasons provided by the First-tier  Tribunal  are  relatively  brief.
       However, the adequacy of reasons must be assessed by reference to the
       material before the Judge. This is an appeal where there  was  little
       by way of supporting evidence. I accept that the finding as to  there
       being a discrepancy in  the  evidence  was  rather  tough  given  the
       Appellant  was  unrepresented  and  that  the  evidence  was  broadly
       consistent. However, had he opted for an oral hearing below he  would
       have had the chance to explain himself more fully, and to that extent
       he is the author of his own misfortune. It is not for  the  Judge  to
       reach the  most  favourable  possible  conclusion  on  the  available
       evidence to one side or another; their job is to  make  reasoned  and
       rational findings on the material before them. It  may  be  the  true
       circumstances can be adequately explained by clearer evidence in  the
       future, but I do not consider that this finding was irrational  given
       the available material.

   13. The admission of the Appellant is governed by immigration  rule  297,
       which so far as relevant to the issues in dispute provides:

         "The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite leave to
         enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents or a
         relative present and settled or being admitted for settlement in
         the United Kingdom are that he:
         (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a parent,
         parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:
         ...
           (e) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
           being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had
           sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or
           (f) one parent or a relative is present and settled in the
           United Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion for
           settlement and there are serious and compelling family or other
           considerations which make exclusion of the child undesirable and
           suitable arrangements have been made for the child's care;"


   14. So there were two routes potentially available for the Appellant  and
       Sponsor  here,  sole  responsibility  and  serious   reasons   making
       exclusion undesirable. The latter route represents a relatively  high
       threshold, and can usefully be assessed by reference to the Secretary
       of State's statement of policy in SET 7.9 set out  in  SG  (child  of
       polygamous marriage) Nepal [2012] UKUT 265 (IAC) which sets out these
       relevant considerations:

         "The ECO should consider all the evidence as a whole, deciding each
         application on its merits:
         �   Are the circumstances surrounding the child exceptional in
         relation to those of other children living in that same country?
         �   Are there emotional/physical factors relating to the sponsoring
         parent in the United Kingdom?
         �   Are there mental/physical factors relating to the non-
         sponsoring parent? Where the physical/mental incapability of the
         non-sponsoring parent has been established, an entry clearance
         should normally be granted.
         But not considered acceptable as a serious and compelling reason
         under this provision:
         �   that the UK offered a higher standard of living than in the
         child's own country".


   15. The First-tier Tribunal did not refer to this limb  of  the  relevant
       Rules, which was indubitably an error of law. However, it was  not  a
       material one, for there was virtually no evidence before  the  First-
       tier Tribunal to make out a viable claim based on the  undesirability
       of the Appellant's exclusion: there was no  detailed  explanation  of
       his present living  arrangements  and  nor  was  there  any  detailed
       explanation as to the reasons why his non-sponsoring parent could not
       assist with his care.


   16. As to sole responsibility, as noted by the  Deputy  President  in  TD
       Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049:

           "13. A central part of the notion of "sole responsibility" for a
           child's upbringing is the UK-based parent's continuing interest
           and involvement in the child's life, including making or being
           consulted about and approving important decisions about the
           child's upbringing." Referring to Nmaju [2001] INLR 26, the TD
           Yemen Tribunal went on to state at [30]: "The Court of Appeal
           saw "sole responsibility" as a practical (rather than
           exclusively legal) exercise of "control" by the UK-based parent
           over the child's upbringing and whether what is done by the
           carer is done "under the direction" of that parent.

   17. The Deputy President went on to discuss relevant considerations  when
       assessing sole responsibility applications:

           "iv. Wherever the parents are, if both parents are involved in
           the upbringing of the child, it will be exceptional that one of
           them will have sole responsibility.
           v. If it is said that both are not involved in the child's
           upbringing, one of the indicators for that will be that the
           other has abandoned or abdicated his responsibility. In such
           cases, it may well be justified to find that that parent no
           longer has responsibility for the child.
           vi. However, the issue of sole responsibility is not just a
           matter between the parents. So even if there is only one parent
           involved in the child's upbringing, that parent may not have
           sole responsibility.
           vii. In the circumstances likely to arise, day-to-day
           responsibility (or decision-making) for the child's welfare may
           necessarily be shared with others (such as relatives or friends)
           because of the geographical separation between the parent and
           child.
           viii. That, however, does not prevent the parent having sole
           responsibility within the meaning of the Rules.
           ix. The test is, not whether anyone else has day-to-day
           responsibility, but whether the parent has continuing control
           and direction of the child's upbringing including making all the
           important decisions in the child's life. If not, responsibility
           is shared and so not "sole"."

   18. Again, there was very little evidence available to the  Judge  below.
       There is an issue regarding the  availability  of  the  mother  as  a
       source of care. She consented to the Appellant's travel  to  the  UK,
       indicating that she has some role by way of parental  responsibility.
       Where the non-sponsoring parent is alive and in theory  available  to
       care for a child, a "sole responsibility" case is rather difficult to
       make out. Cogent evidence is required to show that a parent who is in
       the background has no responsibility for their child's care,  whether
       or not they live with  the  child.  It  is  not  for  the  First-tier
       Tribunal to speculate as to the family background.


   19. Appeals to the Upper Tribunal  are  wholly  limited  (when  assessing
       whether the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law)  to  the
       evidence that was before the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  Appellant's
       grounds of appeal, understandably  given  he  is  not  professionally
       represented,  essentially  make  assertions  that  amount  to   fresh
       evidence. They do not assist in showing that the Judge below erred in
       his treatment of the evidence that was before him.

   20. For these reasons I consider that the appeal must be dismissed.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
