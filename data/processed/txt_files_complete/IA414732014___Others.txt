For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr M Iqbal, Counsel, instructed by Britain
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal brought by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.  However, for clarity I refer to the parties as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  The Respondent appeals  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Coutts dated
    6 November 2015 following a hearing at Richmond (Hatton  Cross)  on  21
    October 2015.  The judge was considering appeals brought by  the  first
    and second Appellants against refusal to vary their  leave  to  remain.
    The third Appellant is a dependant of the second Appellant.

2.   On or around 10 June 2014 the  first  and  second  Appellants  made  an
    application as an entrepreneurial team for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) under the points-based system.  They had incorporated  a
    company entitled IV Solutions (UK) Ltd, which is said to be  a  company
    providing management consultancy services.  The  application  was  made
    under paragraph 245DD of the Immigration Rules.

3.   As part of that application the Respondent  decided  to  interview  the
    Appellants in relation to their application.  That interview took place
    on 15 July 2014.  The Respondent made decisions dated 27  October  2014
    refusing to vary their leave.

4.   The  reasons  for  the  refusals  were  that  the  Respondent  was  not
    satisfied in relation to the first and second Appellants that:


         "you genuinely intend or are able to establish, take over or become
         a director of one or more businesses within the  next  six  months;
         and


         you genuinely intend to invest the money referred to in Table 4  of
         Appendix  A  in  the  Immigration  Rules  in   your   business   or
         businesses."


5.   The reasons for coming to that conclusion were set out in  the  refusal
    letters for both Appellants, which do not materially  differ  in  their
    content.  First of  all  it  was  suggested  that  the  Appellants  had
    provided no evidence to suggest that they  had  been  developing  their
    business during the course of their earlier period of leave  to  remain
    and there was no evidence to demonstrate the creation of  the  business
    before 3 March 2014, the date of the certificate of incorporation of  a
    private company.  It was said that the limited and recent nature of the
    evidence provided raised concerns over the genuineness of the business.

6.   Secondly, concerns were raised over  a  business  contract  with  Atlas
    Driving School in London on which the Appellants relied in  support  of
    their application.  The contract lists management consultancy  services
    that would be provided for a fee of �4,000 broken down into six monthly
    instalments from 28 May 2014 until  20  October  2014.   Atlas  Driving
    School is a franchise that provides support to driving instructors.

7.    It  was  suggested  in  the  refusal  letters  that  the  answers  the
    Appellants had given in relation  to  the  training  they  intended  to
    provide to Atlas was unclear apart  from  some  basic  and  generalised
    advice which would not require any expert knowledge or skill.   It  was
    considered not credible  that  a  business  would  pay  for  management
    consultancy services for such basic training.

8.   A further issue was raised as to whether (i)  the  Appellants  intended
    to provide workshops to  Atlas  Driving  School  or  (ii)  had  already
    provided such workshops.  It was  further  alleged  that  there  was  a
    discrepancy in the Appellants' answers at interview as to whether   two
    of the six monthly instalments of the �4,000 fee had already been paid,
    or whether, as the  first  Appellant  was  attributed  as  saying,  "we
    haven't charged".  It was also not considered feasible that  a  driving
    school would require the Appellants to provide consultancy services and
    training on a 24/7 basis as the Appellants alleged they could.

9.   The Appellants had provided  information  in  their  interviews  as  to
    commission arrangements such that the Appellants' company would receive
    a fee if the client company's turnover increased as a result  of  their
    services.  However, the Respondent asserted that those percentage rates
    and commission charges were not set out in  the  contract  between  the
    parties which merely referred to a receipt of fees of �4,000.   It  was
    said to be questionable as to whether the contract that the  Appellants
    had provided was genuine as  it  gave  the  appearance  of  being  non-
    genuine.

10.  A further issue was  raised  as  to  the  business  premises  that  the
    Appellants intended to  operate  from,  being  72  West  Hill  Road  in
    Wandsworth, London.  They  were  asked  about  that  address  in  their
    interview.  The Respondent suggested that the sublandlord would not  be
    in a position to grant the Appellants a lease and the  Respondent  also
    conducted research  which  demonstrated  that  Wandsworth  Council  had
    received a planning application for those premises to be demolished.

11.  The Respondent also considered the business plans and  market  research
    that had been prepared by the Appellants.  The business plan forecasted
    for sales of �57,000 in year 1 but the Respondent noted that  from  the
    time that the company was incorporated on 3 March 2014 to the  date  of
    interview on 15 July 2014, a period of over four months, the Appellants
    had only claimed to have earned about �1,300.  This was not  consistent
    with the projected  net  profit/sales  of  30.85%  and  the  Respondent
    observed that the Appellants had paid more in office rent than they had
    earned from sales.

12.  The Respondent also asserted that the Appellants' answers in  interview
    about what market research they had done, "was very basic  in  nature",
    and appeared to be saying that the Appellants' only findings were  that
    management consultancy was a growth industry.  It  was  suggested  that
    the Appellants had undertaken little or no market research.

13.  The Respondent concluded that  the  Appellants  were  not  operating  a
    business or had intention to do so  and  there  were  serious  concerns
    regarding the viability and credibility  of  the  Appellants'  business
    plans and market research.

14.  Another issue was  raised  in  relation  to  the  Appellants'  previous
    educational and business experience.  The first Appellant was noted  to
    have been awarded an MA in marketing and information  from  the  Anglia
    Ruskin University in July 2012 and he had stated that he had since been
    working for Fairdeal Construction Ltd as a management  consultant.   It
    was stated to be unclear why Fairdeal Construction Ltd would employ the
    first  Appellant  as  a  management  consultant  rather  than  a  human
    resources or office administrator, given that the Appellant had  stated
    on his CV that  he  worked  for  their  marketing  team,  designed  and
    executed a human  resource  database  and  was  promoted  to  projected
    leadership.

15.  In relation to the second Appellant the Respondent noted  that  he  had
    been awarded an MBA from Coventry University in November 2012  and  had
    been employed by SBA Limited as a business consultant.  The  Respondent
    confirmed the existence of such a company but stated that it was  based
    in Leicester and its business was non-specialised wholesale trade.

16.  As a result of the Respondent  refusing  the  Appellants'  applications
    because they had not satisfactorily demonstrated that they were genuine
    entrepreneurs the Respondent also refused to  award  any  points  under
    Appendix A for  attributes  for  access  to  funds,  funds  held  in  a
    regulated financial institution, or  funds  disposable  in  the  United
    Kingdom, on the following basis:

         "For the reasons stated earlier in this letter, under  the  heading
         'Non-Points Scoring Reasons for Refusal', the Secretary of State is
         not satisfied as to the genuineness of  your  application  and,  in
         accordance with paragraph 245DD of the Immigration Rules, no points
         have been awarded in this area."


    Points were awarded for English language and maintenance.


17.  The Appellants appealed to the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal.   The
    judge had before him a bundle of documents  comprising  thirteen  items
    over 101 pages.  This bundle has been resubmitted to the Upper Tribunal
    for the purposes  of  this  hearing.   That  bundle  contained  witness
    statements of the  Appellants.   In  those  statements  the  Appellants
    describe their immigration history and assert that  they  had  provided
    all the required evidence in accordance with the Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)
    policy guidance and the Immigration  Rules;  confirmed  that  the  Home
    Office  had  never  asked  them  during  the  consideration  of   their
    applications to provide any further or corrected evidence or  document;
    and asserted that they had viable and  credible  information,  business
    contract,  contract  of  business  premises,  business   plan,   market
    research, previous educational and business experience etc.

18.  Paragraph 7 in each of the statements provided as follows:

         "7.  That I have now provided  further  documents  which  ...  does
             confirm that the assumptions of the SSHD are totally wrong and
             my business is genuine and credible."


    Nothing further material is contained in the witness statements.


19.  Appearing before me, Mr Iqbal confirms that much  of  the  contents  of
    the Appellants' bundle submitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  contained
    documents which postdate the application and were not contained  within
    it.  He accepted that none of that material was relevant to the success
    or otherwise of the Appellants' appeals.  Rather, Mr  Iqbal  encouraged
    me  to  consider  the  Respondent's  bundles  in  these  matters  which
    contained the copies of the material submitted with the application.

20.  The way that the First-tier Judge dealt with the  appeal  was  to  hear
    oral evidence from the Appellants and to hear submissions.  The judge's
    decision  is  short.   Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Goldstein  in   granting
    permission to appeal against  the  judge's  decision  on  18  May  2016
    recognised that brevity has its place in the writing of  determinations
    but that this could never be at  the  expense  of  clear  and  adequate
    reasoning.

21.  The judge directed himself in law at paragraphs 6 to  8  and  confirmed
    that under Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002 he could only consider evidence which was submitted in support  of
    the application under the points-based system  at  the  time  that  the
    application was made unless the additional evidence was being  provided
    to prove that a document that was submitted was genuine or valid.

22.  The judge's findings and reasons were  contained  in  short  paragraphs
    between 9 and 14 in the decision:

         "9.  I found the  first  and  second  Appellants  to  be  open  and
             straightforward with their oral evidence.  It was  subject  to
             detailed cross-examination by the Respondent and I found it to
             be credible.


         10.  It is important to put these  applications  in  context.   The
             first and second Appellants have set  up  and  are  running  a
             small business and  therefore  the  scale  and  the  way  they
             operate are linked to their  size  and  the  fact  that  their
             business is in a formative period.


         11.  I am satisfied from their  oral  evidence  together  with  the
             documentation provided with their applications that  they  set
             up and were running their business from 3 March 2014 being the
             required  three  months  before  their  application   to   the
             Respondent.  I also see no reason to  doubt  their  employment
             history prior to that date and the experience they  gained  by
             it.


         12.  I do  not  find  it  significant  that  they  originally  took
             business premises on a periodic monthly lease  or  that  those
             premises were earmarked for demolition.  It is plausible  that
             the Appellants would take  low  cost  business  premises  when
             starting out and it is likely that a building that was planned
             for demolition would provide a reasonable  cost  solution  for
             them.  It is also credible that they were not provided with or
             saw the head lease to the premises that they were renting.  It
             is accepted conveyancing practice for sublessees to  be  bound
             by the terms of a head lease and it is also not uncommon for a
             head lessor to not disclose a head lease.


         13.   The  commission  arrangements  that  the  first  and   second
             Appellants have are plausible given that they are  a  start-up
             business with the payment structure therefore  being  tailored
             towards business increasing.  It is also plausible  that  they
             would offer a 24-hour service to clients: they were  frank  in
             their evidence that they did not intend to work at weekends or
             unsocial hours if they could avoid it,  rather  they  saw  the
             offering of that service as a marketing ploy designed to  give
             them a business edge.


         14.  It follows from  the  above  that  I  am  satisfied  that  the
             Appellants  meet  all  the  relevant   requirements   of   the
             Immigration Rules.  The Appellants are entitled to the further
             leave to remain sought and the Respondent was wrong to  refuse
             their applications."


23.  Permission to appeal was sought  by  the  Respondent  initially  on  10
    November 2015 on the following grounds:

         "Ground 1


         The Secretary of State  considers  that  the  judge  has  erred  in
         failing  to  give  adequate  reasons  for  the  finding  that   the
         Appellants' business was genuine.  In  reaching  his  findings  the
         judge has failed to adequately engage with the issues raised in the
         refusal letter.  Some of the issues not addressed are as follows:


       . Discrepancies between the partners' accounts of their contract with
         Atlas, what they had actually done and how they were to be paid.


       . Lack of proper research into the business in terms  of  a  business
         plan and a major difference  between  their  first  year  projected
         earnings and what they had actually earned.

         Ground 2


         The refusal makes it clear that because of the  genuineness  issues
         arising in the case no separate assessment had been conducted under
         Appendix A.  Specifically access to funds, funds held in  regulated
         financial institutions and funds disposable in the United  Kingdom.
         The Secretary of State considers that the judge has erred in law in
         allowing  the  appeal  outright  without  either  addressing  these
         requirements of the Rules himself or sending the case back  to  the
         Secretary of State to address."


24.  Permission to appeal was initially refused by Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Chambers on 20 April 2016 but upon the Respondent renewing its
    application, Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein granted  permission  on  18
    May 2016, stating as follows:

         "3.  The renewed grounds submit with arguable merit, that the First-
             tier Tribunal Judge may have made an error of law  in  failing
             to give adequate reasons for his findings on material  matters
             and raises arguable issues as to whether he  was  entitled  in
             law to reach the conclusions  that  he  did  for  the  reasons
             given.


         4.   I am in the circumstances persuaded that all  of  the  grounds
             may be argued."


25.  At the outset of the hearing I  drew  to  the  parties'  attention  the
    reported case of Ahmed and Another (PBS:  admissible  evidence)  [2014]
    UKUT 365 (IAC).  In that decision of  the  Vice  President  and  Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge Phillips, the Tribunal stated as  follows  in  its
    head note:

         "1.  Where a provision of the Rules (such as that in para 245DD(k))
             provides that points will not be awarded if the decision-maker
             is not satisfied as to another (non-points-scoring) aspect  of
             the Rule, the non-points-scoring aspect  and  the  requirement
             for points are inextricably linked.


         2.   As a result, the prohibition on new evidence in  s  85A(4)  of
             the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  applies  to
             the non-points-scoring aspect of the Rule: the prohibition  is
             in relation to new  evidence  that  goes  to  the  scoring  of
             points."

26.  I raised this authority because it seemed at least  potentially  to  be
    the case that  as  the  Appellants  themselves  had  in  their  witness
    statements referred to documents that were not before the Secretary  of
    State at the time of the application, and because the judge  repeatedly
    referred to the Appellants' oral evidence,  that  there  was  potential
    that the judge may have impermissibly taken into account evidence  that
    was not submitted with the application. I  provided  the  parties  with
    some time to consider that point before oral submissions commenced.

27.  For the Respondent Mr Avery addressed me by  arguing  that  the  First-
    tier Judge had failed to adequately deal with  the  genuineness  issues
    raised in the decision letter.  The decision was  lacking  in  reasons.
    The principal issue dealt with was  the  location  of  the  Appellants'
    business premises.  Mr Avery asserted that most  of  the  other  issues
    raised by the Respondent in the refusal letter were not dealt with.

28.  The second ground of appeal was that the judge failed to  consider  the
    evidence submitted with  the  application  as  to  the  acquisition  of
    points.  In paragraph 14,  in  which  the  judge  stated  that  he  was
    satisfied that the Appellants met all the relevant requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules, the judge had not stated how he  was  so  satisfied.
    Even if the reasoning as to the genuineness of the Appellants' business
    was sufficient Mr Avery asserted that the  appeal  should  merely  have
    been allowed  to  the  extent  that  the  decision-making  process  was
    incomplete and that the matter therefore  remained  extant  before  the
    Secretary of State in order for her to make findings in relation to the
    other points-based elements of the application.

29.  The judge had  not  identified  satisfactorily  what  elements  of  the
    Appellants' evidence had been found acceptable or had been  taken  into
    account by the judge.  The judge  does  not  differentiate  within  the
    decision between the documents submitted with the application  and  the
    documents submitted in support of the appeal much  of  which  postdated
    the application.

30.  Mr Iqbal for the Appellants addressed me on the authority of Ahmed  and
    Another.  His  view  was  that  this  authority  did  not  support  the
    proposition that  no  oral  evidence  could  be  heard  by  a  Tribunal
    considering a genuineness issue or other non-points-based  issue  in  a
    points-based  system  appeal.   It  did  prohibit   the   reliance   on
    documentary evidence which was not submitted with the application,  but
    does not prohibit the taking into account of oral evidence.

31.  It was clear through paragraph  245AA(k)  that  the  Respondent  had  a
    power to call applicants for an interview and Mr  Iqbal  accepted  that
    any evidence acquired at such an interview was capable of  being  taken
    into account for the purposes of making a decision.

32.  Further Mr Iqbal argued that at paragraph 11 of the decision the  judge
    had stated that "I am satisfied from their oral evidence together  with
    the documentation provided with their applications that they set up and
    were running their business from 3 March 2014 ..." and  this  indicated
    that the judge had taken into account only documentary  evidence  which
    was submitted with the application and had not acted  impermissibly  by
    taking into  account  any  documentary  evidence  which  postdated  the
    application.

33.  The ultimate  submission  of  Mr  Iqbal  was  that  the  judge  in  his
    paragraphs 9 to 14 had found the Appellants to be impressive  witnesses
    who had through their documentation and oral evidence (which  Mr  Iqbal
    asserted the judge was entitled to take into account) satisfied him  of
    the genuineness of their proposed  business.   It  was  not,  Mr  Iqbal
    argued, a duty on the judge to address each and every minute  criticism
    made by the Respondent in the decision letters.

34.  Mr Iqbal averred that in relation to the issues raised in  the  refusal
    letter, the point about the duration of the operation of  the  business
    was dealt with at paragraph 11, where the judge was satisfied that  the
    Appellants had been operating their business for the  relevant  minimum
    three month period prior to the date of application.  Mr  Iqbal  argued
    that if that minimum period were satisfied there was no  need  for  the
    Respondent to look for any longer period and the judge's  dealing  with
    that issue at his paragraph 11 was adequate.

35.  Secondly, in relation to the Appellants' business contract with  Atlas,
    Mr Iqbal argued that the judge had satisfactorily dealt  with  this  at
    his paragraph 13 in finding that the commission arrangements  that  the
    first and second Appellants had were plausible given they were a start-
    up business.  That was an assessment that the  judge  was  entitled  to
    make.  He was  entitled  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  to  take  a
    different approach to the caseworker making the Respondent's  decision.
    It was to be noted that whilst a variety  of  issues  could  have  been
    taken by the Secretary of State in  relation  to  any  application  for
    leave  to  remain  as  an  entrepreneur  only  issues  under  paragraph
    245DD(h)(iii) and (iv) of the  Immigration  Rules  were  raised,  those
    being:

         "(iii)   the viability and credibility of the applicant's  business
             plans and market research into their chosen  business  sector;
             and


         (iv) the applicant's previous educational and  business  experience
             (or lack thereof)."


    Mr Iqbal asserted that the Appellants had met the Respondent's concerns
    on those issues to the satisfaction of the judge.

36.  In relation to ground 2 of the  grounds  of  appeal  (the  awarding  of
    points) Mr Iqbal accepted, having been the  advocate  appearing  before
    the First-tier Judge, that he did not make specific submissions to  the
    judge as to how those points should be awarded.  Mr  Iqbal  pointed  to
    the wording of the Respondent's decisions in this case  which  included
    the following passage:

         "In line with paragraph 245DD(l) of the Immigration Rules  we  have
         not carried out an assessment as detailed in paragraph 245DD(h)  of
         the Immigration Rules as your application  has  been  refused.   We
         reserve the right to carry out this assessment in any challenge  of
         this decision or in future applications for Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)."


37.  The first Appellant's decision also continues:

         "Please note, on  this  occasion  we  have  not  carried  out  full
         verification  checks  on  the  documents  you  submitted   or   the
         statements that you have made on your  application  form,  as  your
         application falls for refusal on other grounds as outlined above."


38.  Mr Iqbal argued that if the judge had been entitled to  find  that  the
    Appellants' business was genuine then he need say  no  more  about  the
    acquisition of  points.   It  was  argued  that  the  passages  in  the
    Appellants' refusal letters above  demonstrated  that  it  is  entirely
    discretionary on the part of the Respondent as to  whether  or  not  to
    carry out full verification checks  on  the  documents  that  had  been
    submitted with the application: not mandatory.   The  judge's  decision
    was therefore complete.  It was not necessary, if the Respondent was so
    arguing, for the judge to have  declared  the  decision-making  process
    incomplete or to declare that the matter  remained  outstanding  before
    the Secretary of State.  The decision to allow the appeal outright  was
    sustainable argued Mr Iqbal.

Discussion

39.  With respect to the judge,  and  acknowledging  that  brevity  has  its
    place  in  decision-making,  I  find  I  am  in  agreement  with  Judge
    Goldstein, who suggested that brevity can never be at  the  expense  of
    clear and adequate reasoning.  I find that the judge's  decision  fails
    to provide adequate consideration or resolution of the following issues
    which were raised by the Respondent in the decision letters:

    (1)  That it was unclear  what  training  the  Appellants  intended  to
         provide to the client company.


    (2)  The apparent discrepancy as to  whether  providing  workshops  had
         been done or was to be done.


    (3)  The apparent discrepancy as to whether  the  Appellants  had  been
         paid two instalments towards their �4,000 fee on the one  hand,  or
         whether they had not charged for services was not resolved.


    (4)  The  Respondent's  concern  that  the  business  plan  and  market
         research was inadequate and did not appear to be realistic;  raised
         at page 3 of 7 of the second Appellant's decision letter  in  which
         it was noted that within a four month  period  the  Appellants  had
         earned only �1,300, whereas they had spent more than that on office
         rent.


40.   Although  the  judge  had  resolved  certain  other  issues   in   the
    Appellants' favour such as the fact that he understood  the  commission
    arrangements  described  in  the  Appellants'  interviews  and  saw  no
    difficulty with the Appellants having taken a sublease on premises  for
    a temporary period even though they were earmarked for demolition,  the
    above points do not seem to me to have been adequately resolved.

41.  Mr Iqbal's submission that it is not incumbent on a judge  to  make  an
    explicit finding on each and every allegation made in a decision  which
    is appealed against, has its limits.  I find  in  particular  that  the
    Respondent had very serious concerns about the adequacy of the business
    plan and the forecast and sales figures, and the  judge  did  not  deal
    with that.  These  were  matters  which  in  my  view  required  to  be
    specifically addressed by the judge.

42.  I do not find it necessary to come to a concluded view  as  to  whether
    or not the authority of Ahmed and Another precludes the receipt of oral
    testimony by Appellants challenging a decision of the Respondent as  to
    the genuineness  of  their  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  application.   The
    decision I reach in this matter is that I find that there are  material
    errors of law in the judge's decision, ie a failure to provide adequate
    reasons in support of his decision, and  failing  to  address  relevant
    issues as highlighted in the Respondent's decision letter.

43.  I set aside the judge's decision.   I  find  that  the  facts  of  this
    appeal need to be  found  afresh.   The  extent  of  that  fact-finding
    process is such that I find that it is appropriate to remit this appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal.  The only recommendation that I would  make
    as to how the matter be dealt  with  in  the  First-tier  is  that  the
    Appellants make a very clear distinction  in  any  materials  that  are
    submitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  between  documents  which  were
    submitted with the original application and any  other  evidence.   The
    Appellants  should  identify  explicitly  the  purpose  for  which  any
    documents that were not submitted with the original application are now
    being relied upon.  I would similarly encourage any Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal to state explicitly  what  documentation  the  judge  has
    taken into account in determining the appeal so that it is clear to the
    reader that they have not erroneously taken into account evidence which
    was not submitted with the application.

    Notice of Decision

    For those reasons the appeal brought  by  the  Secretary  of  State  is
    allowed and the appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.


    No anonymity direction is made.
