Representation:

For the claimant: Mr D Balroop, instructed by Asghar & Co
For the appellant:     Mr Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Wadih Hannah Chouery, date of birth 13.3.69, is a citizen
    of Lebanon.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Wyman, who allowed the  claimant's  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent, dated 6.11.13,  to  refuse  his
    application made on 4.4.13 for indefinite leave to remain  (ILR)  under
    the long residence criteria of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge  heard
    the appeal on 12.2.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Foudy  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    12.3.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 15.4.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal. I found an error of law in the making of the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and set it  aside,  reserving  the  making  of  the
    decision to myself. I gave leave to the  parties  to  lodge  and  serve
    further evidence in relation to any claimed private life under  article
    8 ECHR, in particular to bring matters up to date.   I  also  preserved
    the factual findings of the First-tier Tribunal, with the exception  of
    �57 and those in relation to article 8.

 5. The continuation hearing was then listed before me for the 29.5.14.  By
    letter  dated  16.5.14  the   claimant's   representative   sought   an
    adjournment on the basis that a subject access request had been made of
    the Home Office and a pre-action protocol letter issued  regarding  the
    status of his Legacy application. It was submitted that without further
    information on the Legacy application the appeal could  not  be  justly
    determined.

 6. Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun considered but refused the  application,  on
    the basis that  the  case  could  be  determined  without  the  further
    information.

 7. The claimant's representative then submitted an application  to  add  a
    further ground of appeal in relation to a Legacy  claim.  The  relevant
    chronology is that it is said that the claimant made an application  on
    10.10.07 for his case to be  considered  under  the  Legacy  programme,
    chased by further letters and representations including  in  March  and
    April 2012 seeking ILR on the basis of  14  years  long  residence.  In
    response, it is said, on 21.1.13 the Secretary  of  State  forwarded  a
    SET(O) application form, which was completed and  submitted,  resulting
    in the decision which is the subject of this appeal.

 8. Based on the recent authority of Edgehill & Anor v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ
    402, Mr Balroop intended to  argue  that  as  there  was  an  effective
    application  for  consideration  under  the  14-year   long   residence
    provisions, made prior to the  wholesale  changes  in  the  Immigration
    Rules of 9.7.12 introducing Appendix FM and 276ADE, with a 20-year long
    residence requirement, the transitional provisions state that  the  new
    Rules would not apply to applications for leave to remain made prior to
    that date.

 9. That  argument  was  made  more  complicated  by  the  recent  case  of
    Halemuddin [2014] EWCA Civ 558, which appears  to  contradict  Edgehill
    and suggests that the Rules must be applied at the date of decision.

10. These issues impinge on the existing appeal and  the  remaking  of  the
    decision. I accept the submission of both Mr Jarvis and Mr Balroop that
    it would make no sense not to resolve the Legacy/14-year long residence
    argument in the Upper Tribunal, leaving the matter  to  be  pursued  by
    Judicial Review. However, Mr Jarvis was taken somewhat by  surprise  in
    Mr Balroop's new argument, supported by his  skeleton  argument  served
    only today.

11. In the circumstances, I agreed with both parties that the Secretary  of
    State should have the opportunity to consider and respond to this newly
    raised issue and consider her position in relation to the Legacy claim.
    I therefore adjourned the hearing and issued further directions.

12. I did not grant leave to add the further ground of appeal,  wishing  to
    first hear from the Secretary of State  on  the  matter.  However,  the
    Secretary of State should be prepared to deal with the ground if  I  do
    give leave at the continuation hearing.

13. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    claimant first came to the UK on 10.4.97 on the  basis  of  a  multiple
    entry visit visa. During the currency of his leave he applied  for  but
    was refused further leave to remain. His appeal against  that  decision
    was dismissed on 8.6.00. However, the claimant did not  leave  and  was
    thus an overstayer in the UK. He made his present application  to  vary
    leave on 18.2.13, on the basis of the long residence provisions of  the
    Immigration Rules.

14. The application was  refused  on  1.11.13  following  consideration  of
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules. The claimant  was  in  the  UK
    without valid leave from 2.10.97. In the  circumstances  he  could  not
    demonstrate compliance with paragraph 276B(v).

15. His application also failed  under  paragraph  276ADE  in  relation  to
    private life and there was no evidence of a partner or child in the  UK
    in order to found a family life claim.

16. At �62 of the determination Judge Wyman found that the  claimant  could
    not meet the requirements for long residence under paragraph 276B.  The
    judge also found that as the claimant still had ties with Lebanon, with
    a large number of siblings there, he did not meet the  requirements  of
    paragraph  276ADE.  Those  findings  were  entirely  justified  on  the
    evidence and have been preserved.

17. There is no merit in the Legacy claim aspect  of  the  appeal.  As  the
    Court of Appeal held in RN [2014] EWCA Civ 938, legacy cases were those
    where applications were made before 5.3.07 but  not  resolved  by  July
    2011. The alleged application made on 10.10.07 could  not  properly  be
    considered a legacy case. In any  event,  the  Legacy  Scheme  did  not
    confer any additional substantive rights on  the  Legacy  cohort;  it's
    purpose was administrative and organisational and bore  no  resemblance
    to an amnesty. A legacy case confers no particular entitlement  on  the
    claimant and he cannot build a claim of entitlement on that  basis.  In
    Jaku v SSHD [2014] EWHC 605 (Admin) Ouseley J stated, " At the heart of
    much of the litigation over the  years  have  been  eventually  largely
    fruitless and in my judgement misconceived  attempts  by  claimants  to
    show that there was a special and more favourable policy  which  should
    be applied to those in the Legacy programme, devised from a  target  or
    aim as to the date by which decisions would be made. Their  target  was
    then elevated into a legitimate expectation; arising  it  was  said  to
    create unlawful delay such as to create an historic injustice,  leading
    to arguments that the particular forms of leave should be granted, that
    policies should be  treated  as  frozen,  that  particular  periods  of
    residence should be given great weight, all deriving from a  misreading
    of policy..."

18. The reality is that even if this  were  a  legacy  case,  all  that  it
    implied is that the Secretary of State would consider  the  application
    on the basis of the Rules in force at the time of consideration.


19. For the reasons set out below, I also reject the  submission  that  the
    'Old Rules' apply and that the claimant should be judged on  the  basis
    of a 14-year residence requirement.


20. Paragraph 276ADE containing the 20-year long residence requirement  was
    brought into force under HC194 with effect from  9.7.12.  However,  the
    statement of  changes  provided  that  "if  an  application  for  entry
    clearance, leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain has been  made
    before 9 July 2012 and the application has not been decided, it will be
    decided in accordance with the rules in force on 8 July 2012."


21. The  Statement  of  Changes  HC760,  brought  into  force  on  13.12.12
    "provided that those changes to the Rules on family  and  private  life
    were to take effect on 13 December 2012 and that if  an  applicant  had
    made an application for entry clearance or  leave  before  13  December
    2012 and the application had not been  decided  before  that  date,  it
    would be decided in accordance with the Rules in force on  12  December
    2012." However, the Statement of Changes HC  820  came  into  force  on
    13.12.12.  The  policy  statement  within  the  Statement  of   Changes
    explained that whilst transitional provisions  continued  to  apply  to
    family member applications under Part 8  of  the  Rules,  "Where  other
    applications made before, on or after 9 July 2012 raise issues relating
    to family or private life, those issues will be  decided  according  to
    the Immigration Rules in force at the date of decision."


22. The decision in this case was made on  6.11.13  and  the  Secretary  of
    State applied the  Immigration  Rules  in  respect  of  the  claimant's
    private life claim, namely paragraph 276ADE, and was correct to do  so,
    regardless of when the application can be said to have been made.


23. Although Mr Balroop relied on Edgehill, it is clear  when  reading  the
    judgement of the Court of Appeal that it was based on the  transitional
    provision in existence at the date of decision in relation  to  276ADE.
    In the case of JE, the application was made on 22.8.11 and  refused  on
    7.3.12. The error was in the Upper Tribunal's reliance on 276ADE on the
    basis of determining an article 8 claim on the basis of  the  Rules  in
    force at the date of hearing, i.e. 276ADE rather than applying.  It  is
    not clear when the application of HB, the other claimant, was  decided,
    but as neither 14 nor  20  years  had  been  achieved  the  appeal  was
    dismissed. Edgehill did not consider  at  all  the  situation  in  this
    appeal, that the transitional provisions for 276ADE  had  been  removed
    prior to the decision of the Secretary of State.

24. In Haleemudeen, the claimant's application under 276B on 28.2.12, prior
    to the 'New Rules,' was refused on 1.10.12.  Again,  I  note  that  the
    refusal decision was before the removal of the  transitional  provision
    for 276ADE.  The  refusal  in  Haleemudeen  was  based  on  a  criminal
    conviction, which was a bar to 276B, and the error of the Tribunal  was
    to consider that there had  been  a  break  in  the  continuous  lawful
    residence and thus miscalculated the period. The claimant  did  not  in
    fact meet the requirements of the Rules and the question at issue was a
    proportionality assessment outside  the  Rules.  Haleemudeen  does  not
    assist the claimant in the appeal before me.

25. Having heard the submissions of the representatives and considered both
    the evidence and case law, I reject the  argument  that  there  was  an
    effective  application  in  2007  under  the  14-year  long   residence
    provisions and that notwithstanding  the  changes  in  the  Rules  from
    9.7.12 the claimant is entitled to leave to remain. The  only  relevant
    application was the one made on 4.4.13. The communications in 2007  was
    not an application and the assertion that it was accepted as such is  a
    red herring in this case. In any event, on the evidence I do not accept
    that the claimant was ever accepted under the scheme. Even if  he  was,
    all that entailed was that his application  would  be  decided  on  the
    basis of the Immigration Rules applicable at the date of decision.

26. I also reject Mr Baldroop's argument based  on  an  extrapolation  from
    Kishver (limited leave: meaning) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 410  (IAC),  that
    on the basis that the Secretary of State had dealt with the case as  if
    there had been a valid application was an implicit acceptance  that  it
    was valid. He relied on regulation 17  of  the  Immigration  (Leave  to
    remain)  (prescribed  forms  and  procedures)  Regulation  2007.  Those
    regulations do not apply to the claimant's representations  as  to  14-
    year long residence in correspondence sent in 2012. Rule 34 as  amended
    was in force at that time. This requires an application to be  made  on
    the  specified  form.  Rule  34A  provides  that  any  application  not
    complying will be invalid and not considered. The  Secretary  of  State
    rejected those letters (A57 & 61), and sent the  claimant  the  correct
    specified form in January 2013 and rejected his application as  invalid
    in the Home Office letter of 16.3.13. It was not until 18.2.13 that the
    claimant made what could be considered as a valid application.

27. There is no merit in a 'near miss'  argument,  to  the  effect  had  an
    appropriate application been made in 2012 he may well have been granted
    leave to remain on the then-prevailing long residence requirement of 14
    years.

28. The claimant's application  was  properly  considered  under  paragraph
    276ADE. This makes provision for the situation where an applicant  does
    not meet the 20-year long residence  requirement  but  can  demonstrate
    that he has no ties, including social, cultural  and  family  with  the
    country to which he would have to go if removed. I have  preserved  the
    findings of Judge Wyman, including those at �67 that the claimant  does
    still have ties with Lebanon, "as he has a large number of siblings who
    remain living there. Even though the claimant has not seen them for the
    past seventeen years, he clearly shares family and cultural ties."  His
    appeal thus failed under 276ADE. Mr Baldroop has not  sought  to  argue
    that the claimant meets the requirements of 276ADE. Instead, he  relies
    on consideration of private and family life  outside  the  Rules  under
    article 8 ECHR.

29. I reject Mr Baldroop's argument that there is no provision in  Appendix
    FM for a person in the claimant's circumstances and that thus there are
    exceptional circumstances justifying consideration outside  the  Rules.
    Section R-ILRDR provides a reasoned approach to a claim  for  leave  to
    remain as an adult dependent relative. It is also of note  and relevant
    to any article 8 proportionality assessment that there is a  route  for
    entry clearance for such a dependant relative. He fails to qualify  for
    indefinite leave to remain because he is  not  in  the  UK  with  valid
    leave. However, he could return to Lebanon and make  application  under
    section E-ECDR, provided he can demonstrate that he  meets  E-ECDR  2.4
    and 2.5, to the effect that he  requires  long-term  personal  care  to
    perform everyday tasks, and unable to obtain the required level of care
    in the country in which he is living because either it is not available
    or not affordable. In any event the claimant has  not  demonstrated  on
    the present evidence that he meets such criteria relating to  long-term
    personal care needs, so that it is not clear that such  an  application
    would succeed. This must be highly relevant  to  whether  it  would  be
    proportionate to allow him to remain, when he  cannot  meet  the  Rules
    provided for such a person.

30. Although Judge Wyman went on to consider private and family life  under
    article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration Rules, on the basis  of  current
    case law, there is no need to consider article  8  outside  the  Rules,
    unless there are compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised  in
    the Immigration Rules which would justify, exceptionally, allowing  the
    application under article 8 on the basis that the decision  produced  a
    result that was unjustifiably harsh.

31. Before I could consider the claimant's private and  family  law  rights
    outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  I  would  have  to  find  compelling
    circumstances insufficiently recognised in the Rules so as to  justify,
    exceptionally, allowing the appeal outside the Rules  under  article  8
    ECHR on the basis that the decision is  unjustifiably  harsh.  Although
    the case law continues to develop, the current position is perhaps best
    expressed in paragraph 135 of  R(MM (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    985:

         "135.  Where the relevant group of IRs  [immigration  rules],  upon
         their proper construction provide a  "complete  code"  for  dealing
         with a person's Convention rights in the context of a particular IR
         or statutory provision, such as in the case of "foreign criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with  that  code,  although  reference  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality exercise.  But if the relevant group of IRs is  not
         such a "complete code" then the proportionality test will  be  more
         at large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and  UK  and  Strasbourg
         case law."


32. However,  I  am  satisfied  that  on  the  facts  of  this  appeal  the
    Immigration Rules do fully and adequately address  the  claims  of  the
    claimant's private life by the considerations required under  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules and amount to a complete code, involves
    a reasonableness or proportionality assessment, such that there  is  no
    need to consider article 8 outside the Rules. I  find  no  sufficiently
    compelling circumstances  on  the  facts  of  this  case  and  thus  no
    justification for considering article 8 private life outside the Rules,
    contrary to the way in which Judge Wyman determined the appeal  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal.


33. Even if I am wrong and consideration of private life  under  article  8
    ECHR is justified outside  the  Rules,  I  am  satisfied  that  on  the
    application of the Razgar  5  steps  that  the  interference  with  any
    private life acquired in the  UK  whilst  the  claimant  was  illegally
    present is insufficiently grave to engage article 8.

34. Even if  article  8  is  engaged,  in  conducting  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise between on the one hand the right of the claimant to
    respect for his private life  and  on  the  other  the  legitimate  and
    necessary aim to protect the economic well-being of the UK through  the
    objective application of immigration control, the  balance  would  come
    firmly and clearly down in favour of the Secretary of State's  decision
    to remove him from the UK. In reaching that conclusion,  the  following
    factors,  amongst  others,  have  been  taken  into  consideration.   I
    specifically did not preserve the findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    in relation to the article 8 assessment. Mr  Baldroop's  submission  in
    his skeleton argument that I did is mistaken. However, in  addition  to
    all those matters urged upon me by Mr  Baldroop  and  set  out  in  the
    claimant's bundle, the following relevant  factors  would  need  to  be
    considered  in  any  article  8  proportionality  assessment.  I   have
    carefully considered all the evidence together in the round, even if  I
    do no specifically mention it below, I have given anxious consideration
    to all those matters and factors on the alternative consideration basis
    that there is not a complete code and that the circumstances do justify
    assessment of proportionality outside  the  Immigration  Rules  on  the
    basis of article 8 private and family life.

35. The claimant, who is single and with no children,  claims  family  life
    with his brothers Camil and Joseph Chouery, which is really  an  aspect
    of his private life. He has lived with them for approximately 17 years.
    He has now been found to have Down's Syndrome. He is evidently a  close
    part of the family of his brothers and I accept that there is  a  close
    and supportive relationship. On this claimant's circumstances and  with
    his disabilities that may go beyond the normal  emotional  ties  to  be
    expected between adult siblings, but that is  only  one  factor  to  be
    considered in the round with all other relevant  factors  in  assessing
    proportionality.

36. Whilst I take into account the lengthy residence of the claimant in the
    UK, and the argument that there has been some delay on the part of  the
    Secretary of State in reaching her decision, which is not the fault  of
    the claimant, there are other more significant factors weighing against
    the length of residence and delay. I also take the view  that  some  of
    the responsibility for that delay lies at the claimant's door.

37. The claimant had overstayed his permitted leave and he knew  throughout
    his time here that his status in the UK was  unlawful  and  precarious,
    and that he was at risk of being required to leave. The evidence of his
    family members has to be taken cautiously not  only  because  they  may
    well have a natural tendency to exaggerate his conditions, because they
    want him  to  stay,  but  also  because  they  must  have  deliberately
    encouraged and facilitated his illegal stay in the UK over many  years.
    Any private life accrued during such  circumstances  can  carry  little
    weight in the balancing exercise. Deception was practised in that there
    was no real intention for him to return to Lebanon when he came. In  ZS
    (Jamaica) & Anr [2012] EWCA Civ 1639, Lord Justice Davis held  that  on
    any view such behaviour is a serious  matter  and  should  be  accorded
    commensurate seriousness as a countervailing factor  in  the  balancing
    exercise in any proportionality assessment.

38. Also  considered  is  that  the  claimant  has  mild/moderate  learning
    disabilities now diagnosed as Down's Syndrome, and had been  abused  in
    Lebanon and it is alleged he would face abuse on return. I note that at
    p164 of the 1998 report in the claimant's bundle, Ms Nash is quoted and
    relied on. She envisaged that at some point the claimant  would  return
    to Lebanon to live with his family at some point  in  the  future,  but
    with a far greater repetoire of skills, and greater confidence  in  his
    abilities than he had previously shown, acquired during his  stay  with
    Ms Nash. "She hopes that his greater independence will be  acknowledged
    by his family  who  will  continue  to  support  him  in  his  personal
    development upon his return." Surprisingly, given her role in assisting
    him, Ms Nash was not called to give evidence on the claimant's  behalf.
    It  is  also  surprising  that  there  is  not  more  evidence  as   to
    circumstances in Lebanon and particularly from  the  claimant's  family
    there.

39. I take into account the country expert Dr  Fatah's  report  of  14.5.14
    suggesting in the headnote at section 6 that there is a stigma attached
    to mental illness in the general population. However,  the  source  for
    the opinion appears, at least in part, to  be  a  2011  report  in  the
    Lancet, which in fact reports positive improvements  in  mental  health
    care in Lebanon, including the provision of MSF clinics and training to
    practitioners  and  mid-level  staff  on   mental   disorders.   Having
    considered that report,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  it  significantly
    advances the claimant's case by the generality of the discussion.

40. I take into account Dr Shah's report  of  1.5.14  that  the  claimant's
    removal to an  unfamiliar  environment  after  16  years  absence  that
    environment may affect his psychological and emotional  functioning.  I
    have also considered the psychology report of Dr  Nias  but  find  that
    it's objectivity is skewed by the reliance that had to be made  on  not
    only the questionable use  of  interpretation  through  the  claimant's
    brother but the acceptance of the family's assertions at p227 that  the
    long, drawn-out process has seriously affected his  mental  well-being,
    and reliance on letters from friends  of  the  claimant.  Much  of  the
    assessment seems to be about the stress of awaiting the outcome of  the
    appeal process, all of which will be resolved  one  way  or  the  other
    before removal. The report notes that  there  is  considerable  support
    from his brothers, and that it appears far from certain that  help  and
    other support anywhere near this level could  be  offered  in  Lebanon.
    This is not expert evidence but rather a reflection of the  absence  of
    evidence rather than of positive evidence. The report does not in  fact
    conclude that he cannot return and seems  primarily  concerned  with  a
    resolution to the present uncertainty.

41. However, these medical and health concerns do not cross the  article  3
    threshold. Whilst he has been in the UK since 1997, the claimant  spent
    the majority of his life in Lebanon, including his youth and  formative
    years and education. He still speaks the language and has  some  family
    there, including siblings, although his parents have passed away.  Even
    though he may not have spoken with some of his family for some time, he
    would be familiar with the culture and customs and there is  no  reason
    why he could not re-establish contact with his family and be  supported
    by them. Any medical problems he has he also suffered  from  whilst  in
    Lebanon, where he can  obtain  appropriate  treatment.  He  could  also
    receive financial assistance from his family in  the  UK  and  maintain
    contact and  emotional  support  with  them  through  modern  means  of
    communication.

42. I take into account that the claimant has been fully supported  by  his
    brothers in the UK and that the claimant's wishes are to remain in  the
    UK. However, there was no cogent evidence that  the  claimant's  family
    could or would not continue to support him  in  Lebanon.  I  note  that
    there is  a  paucity  of  reliable  and  satisfactory  evidence  as  to
    circumstances  in  Lebanon  and  in  particular  social  attitudes  the
    claimant may face because of his disability. I also note  that  on  the
    limited evidence available the claimant has failed to demonstrate  that
    he would even meet the requirements for entry  clearance  as  an  adult
    dependent relative, which  must  be  relevant  to  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise.

43. Weighing all the evidence together in the round, I am satisfied for the
    reasons set out above that in any proportionality  balancing  exercise,
    on the facts of this case  the  balance  falls  clearly  in  favour  of
    removal.

Conclusions:

44. For the reasons set out above, I find that he claimant  has  failed  to
    demonstrate that he meets either the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules for leave to remain or that his circumstances are such that leave
    should be granted outside the Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed on all grounds.
