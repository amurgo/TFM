                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator  (Mr  JD  Atkinson),
   sitting at Epsom on 13 November 2003, allowing on article 8 grounds only
   an asylum and human rights appeal by a citizen of  Pakistan.  Permission
   to appeal was given on the basis that the Tribunal  needed  to  consider
   the general point as to "... whether the limited  British  visa  service
   now available in Pakistan raises an "insurmountable obstacle" to  family
   reunion here by that route".

2. Shortly after permission was given, that same question was considered by
   another panel (Warr VP and lay members) in a  reported  decision  [2004]
   UKIAT 00034 A (Pakistan). As will become clear, we fully agree with  the
   decision in 34 A, and have only a little to add, in the same  direction.
   However, the present panel was set up to  deal  with  this  point  in  a
   country guidance decision, which it is expected  that  all  adjudicators
   (and other panels of the Tribunal) will follow.


3. The background evidence filed by Mr Amarasinha shows the visa facilities
   remain as they were when 34 A was heard: see � 12.

   We have, however, looked at the  document  setting  out  the  facilities
   available in Pakistan for the processing of  visas.   The  visa  section
   Islamabad is not able to accept visa applications direct from  customers
   but offers a limited service and a dedicated UK visa  telephone  enquiry
   call centre operates from Karachi. A visa service  is  provided  through
   Gerry's/FedEx offices. Among those who are able to avail  themselves  of
   the service are those who are making settlement applications  providing,
   in the case of spouses, that the spouse in the United Kingdom is settled
   and aged eighteen and over.  There is a  proviso  to  which  Mr  Hussein
   referred.  If the applicant has been refused a visa for the  UK  or  for
   any other country, or been refused entry to the UK or any other  country
   or failed to comply with conditions of entry to  the  UK  or  sought  an
   extension of stay in the UK 'then we may not be  able  to  resolve  your
   application and it may be returned to you'.   It is  suggested  that  in
   complex cases an interview may be necessary  and  that  will  cause  the
   appellant difficulties. The British High Commission document appears  to
   suggest that facilities are available for interview - see page 5 'If  an
   interview is necessary, you will be contacted and given details.'  There
   is a further reference later on in the document about an aim to  make  a
   decision without calling applicants  for  interview  whenever  possible.
   Processing times for settlement applications is given as three months.



4. The only point of difference between this case and 34 A is a  technical,
   rather than substantial one. In 34 A the adjudicator had found in favour
   of the Home Office on the question of whether the claimant could in fact
   make his application for a family reunion visa from  Pakistan;  so  that
   point was not directly in issue on the  Home  Office  appeal  from  him.
   However the Tribunal at � 11 saw no reason to disturb that finding.

5. The adjudicator in the present case was - as so often in ones which  get
   this far - let down by the Home Office, who not only failed to  field  a
   presenting officer, but also to put in any details of their current visa
   arrangements. Quite enterprisingly the claimant's representative put  in
   a print-out of their web-site, which showed that  there  was  a  limited
   service available in Islamabad. Exactly why the adjudicator then went on
   to decide that there was a real risk that the claimant would not be able
   to make a visa application at all is far from clear; but on the evidence
   put in before us for the claimant, he was obviously wrong on that.

6. The adjudicator found in favour of the claimant, even if the finding  we
   have just dealt with were wrong, on the basis that there was in any case
   a real risk that the granting  of  entry  clearance  would  be  severely
   delayed. Again the factual basis for that finding is not at  all  clear,
   and we see none for it in the information before  us.  The  "real  risk"
   test (applied in Kacaj [01/TH/00632] to questions arising on asylum  and
   article 3 grounds, and approved on this point by the Court of Appeal) is
   in our view equally inappropriate to article 8  considerations  of  this
   kind. The correct approach is to be found in Edore [2003] EWCA Civ 716.

7. Even if that alternative  finding  were  tenable,  however,  we  see  no
   warrant for the conclusion that the adjudicator drew  from  it,  to  the
   effect that the young age of the claimant's  children  would  make  that
   delay an  exceptional  circumstance,  amounting  to  an  "insurmountable
   obstacle" to family reunion here. That test was quite clearly set by the
   Court of Appeal in Amjad Mahmood [2002] Imm AR 229; and  the  Master  of
   the Rolls went so far as to say (at � 65) that not even  the  fact  that
   such an application might not in the  end  succeed  was  any  reason  to
   excuse the claimant  from  making  a  family  reunion  application  from
   outside this country.

8. In 34 A, as well as older children of the claimant's wife by a  previous
   marriage, there was a child of the present marriage on the  way.  As  in
   that case, both the present claimant and his wife must  have  been  well
   aware of the claimant's precarious immigration status when they married;
   and indeed when the children (born 2 February 2002 and 3 November  2003)
   were conceived. We need not repeat what the Tribunal (Ouseley P, Moulden
   and Lane VPP) said in [2004] UKIAT 00024 M* (Croatia) at  ��  33  &  36,
   about families started in those circumstances.

9. The Tribunal in 34 A found no exceptional circumstances in the effect of
   the current visa facilities in Pakistan on the claimant's family life to
   justify not following the approach in Mahmood; and neither do we in this
   case. We cannot at present  imagine  any  circumstances,  short  of  the
   imminent death of one of the family members involved,  why  the  current
   visa facilities in Pakistan should lead to not following Mahmood.

10. So far as this decision may be of any help in dealing with lack of  such
   facilities in other countries, we should go on to recommend adjudicators
   to pay close attention to the phrase "insurmountable obstacles" used  by
   the Court of Appeal in Mahmood. There is no reason to suppose the  Court
   of Appeal did not mean what they  said;  and  nothing  to  suggest  that
   either having to apply by post, where a postal  service  exists,  or  in
   person in a third country, which there is nothing  to  show  one  cannot
   reach, may amount to such an obstacle.
