Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Hoshi, instructed by Migrant Legal Project
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
      2008 (SI 2008/269) we make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
      Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of these  proceedings
      shall directly or indirectly identify the Appellant.   This  direction
      applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and a  failure  to
      comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to   Contempt   of   Court
      proceedings.

Introduction

   2. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq who was born on 11 March 1976.  The
      appellant initially left Iraq and  travelled  to  Holland  in  January
      2006.  He claimed asylum and was granted a five year residence  permit
      valid  until  2  April  2012.   However,  that  residence  permit  was
      withdrawn and subsequent appeals  by  the  appellant  dismissed.   The
      appellant was, as a consequence, returned to Iraq on 16 August 2011.

   3. The appellant left Iraq for a second time  on  24  November  2011  and
      travelled to the United Kingdom.  He  claimed  asylum  on  2  December
      2011.   On  17  April  2013,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused   the
      appellant's application for asylum  and  humanitarian  protection  and
      under Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the ECHR. On 21 April 2013, the Secretary
      of State made a decision to remove the appellant to  Iraq  by  way  of
      directions.

The First-tier Tribunal Decision

   4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a determination
      promulgated on 12 June 2013, Judge  Troup  dismissed  the  appellant's
      appeal on all grounds.  Before the First-tier Tribunal, the  appellant
      claimed that he would face a real risk of persecution or serious  ill-
      treatment in Iraq on four bases:

              i) imputed political opinion because of his association with a
                 friend "BY"  a  political  journalist  who  was  unlawfully
                 killed in 2010;

             ii) his religious belief, namely  his  (imputed)  Shi'a  Muslim
                 faith;

            iii) his membership of a particular social  group  (PSG)  and/or
                 his imputed political opinion, namely  as  a  'westernised'
                 returnee; and

             iv) his membership of PSG, namely homosexual men in Iraq.

   5. As regards each of these claims, Judge Troup did not accept  that  the
      appellant  was  at  risk  on  return.   The  Judge  made  an   adverse
      credibility finding and rejected the appellant's account that  he  had
      come to  the  attention  of  the  Asaab-Ahal-Alalhq,  an  organisation
      violently opposed to the UN Assistance Mission  in  Iraq  through  his
      association with a childhood friend, "BY" who was a journalist and who
      had written articles critical of the organisation.  Further, the Judge
      found, having regard  to  the  background  evidence  and  the  country
      guidance decision of HM and Others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT
      00409 (IAC) that the appellant had not shown that he would be at  risk
      because of his Shi'a faith or on the basis of his being "westernised".
       Finally, the Judge did not accept the appellant's  evidence  that  he
      was gay and at risk on return on as a result.





Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

   6. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  (UT).
      On 4 July 2013, the  First-tier  Tribunal  (DJ  Garratt)  granted  the
      appellant permission to  appeal.   The  appeal  was  initially  listed
      before the UT (UTJ Grubb) on 9 October 2013.  Following that  hearing,
      in a decision dated 25 October 2013 the UT concluded that Judge  Troup
      had not made an error of  law  in  reaching  his  adverse  credibility
      findings and that his decision to dismiss the  appellant's  appeal  on
      the bases set out above in paragraph 4(i)-(iii) stood.

   7. However, the UT concluded that Judge Troup had erred in law in finding
      that the appellant was not at risk on return to Iraq on the  basis  of
      his sexual orientation - as set out in paragraph 4(iv) above.

   8. The Judge's decision to dismiss the appeal on humanitarian grounds and
      under Article 8 was not challenged and those decisions stood.

   9. Consequently, the UT directed that the appeal should be relisted for a
      resumed hearing in order to remake the  decision  in  respect  of  the
      appellant's claim to be a refugee on the basis that he was gay and  at
      risk of persecution because of his sexual  orientation  on  return  to
      Iraq.

  10. The appeal was listed for a resumed hearing on 19 December 2013 before
      the present constitution of the Upper Tribunal.  At that hearing,  the
      appellant was represented by Mr Hoshi and the Secretary of  State  was
      represented by Mr Richards.

The Issues

  11. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Richards did not seek to argue
      that the appellant could be returned to Iraq if he established that he
      was gay.  We did not, therefore, hear  any  argument  based  upon  the
      background material in relation to the risk, if any, on return to Iraq
      of a gay man.  The sole issue upon which we  were  addressed  was  the
      appellant's credibility and whether we  accepted  his  claimed  sexual
      orientation.   Given  our  adverse  conclusion  on   the   appellant's
      credibility, we do not express any  view  on  the  correctness  of  Mr
      Richards' concession.

The Law

  12. The burden of proof is upon the appellant to establish that there is a
      real risk that he will be persecuted for a Convention  reason,  namely
      as a member of a PSG (gay men in Iraq) or will be subjected to serious
      ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR.

  13. In reaching our findings and conclusions in this appeal, we have taken
      into account all the evidence both oral and documentary that  was  put
      before us.

The Evidence

  14. Without objection from  Mr  Richards,  we  admitted  into  evidence  a
      supplementary bundle of documents from the appellant under rule 15(2A)
      of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/2698).
      That bundle contained, inter alia, a supplementary  witness  statement
      from the appellant dated 2 December 2013; an expert report prepared by
      Sheri Laizer dated 27  November  2013;  and  a  number  of  background
      documents and policy documents relating to refugee claims  based  upon
      sexual orientation.  On behalf of the appellant, Mr Hoshi  put  before
      us a helpful skeleton argument.

  15. The appellant gave oral evidence in which he adopted his supplementary
      witness statement dated 2 December  2013.  The  appellant  was  cross-
      examined by Mr Richards and asked a number of  questions,  by  way  of
      clarification of his evidence, by the Tribunal.  During the course  of
      the appellant's evidence, the Tribunal raised a concern as to  whether
      the interpreter might,  perhaps,  be  encountering  difficulties  when
      interpreting  the  appellant's  evidence  given  that  it  related  to
      sensitive matters concerning the appellant's sexual orientation or for
      some other reason.  In  order  that  enquiry  could  be  made  of  the
      interpreter,  the  Tribunal  asked  the  appellant  (though  not   his
      representative) to leave  the  hearing  room  briefly.   The  Tribunal
      indicated  to  Mr  Hoshi  that  he  could  explain  to  the  appellant
      subsequently why he had been asked to  leave  the  hearing  room.   Mr
      Hoshi did not demur.  Having made  enquiry  of  the  interpreter,  the
      Tribunal was satisfied that the interpreter was able  to  perform  his
      function fully.  The Appellant remained outside the hearing  room  for
      at most five minutes.

  16. It was not disputed that the appellant lived  in  Iraq  until  January
      2006 when he left and travelled to Holland.  He lived there  until  he
      was removed to Iraq on 16 August 2011.  He left Iraq and came  to  the
      UK on 24 November 2011.

      Witness Statements

  17. The evidence concerning the appellant's claim to be gay and at risk on
      return to Iraq is set out in his two  statements  dated  22  May  2013
      (pages  A1-A5  FtT  bundle)  and  2   December   2013   (pages   A1-A3
      supplementary bundle).

  18. In his statement  of  22  May  2013,  at  paras  10-11  the  appellant
      described his "first relationship with another  man".   This  occurred
      whilst he was in Holland between 2006 and  2011.   He  says  that  the
      man's name was  "Jan"  and  lasted  for  8  months.   The  appellant's
      evidence is as follows:

           "10.  It was in Holland that I had my  first  relationship  with
                 another man.  I realised a long time ago that I like to  be
                 with men and not  women,  however,  this  is  something  we
                 cannot say in Iraqi society.  Every time I had a girlfriend
                 I would stay with her for a few weeks  and  then  we  would
                 separate.  I could not be open about this in  Iraq  because
                 people could kill you.  I have  never  told  anyone  before
                 because I am ashamed, and even  in  Holland  I  kept  it  a
                 secret.  I don't like even to talk about it.  But I  cannot
                 hide it any longer and need to talk about it in the  court.
                 I am really frightened to tell people  about  these  things
                 because I think they won't like me anymore  and  they  will
                 try to get away from me and avoid me.

           11.   In Holland I used to go to the gay pubs and bars.   I  was
                 in a relationship with a Dutch guy called Jan for 8  months
                 but neither of us wanted  to  make  it  public  so  it  was
                 secret.  I used to have friends in Holland  from  Iraq  and
                 other countries - there is a bigger gay  scene  in  Holland
                 than in the UK."

  19. That statement makes no reference  to  any  relationship  with  a  man
      whilst the appellant was living in Iraq.

  20. In his more recent statement dated 2 December 2013, the appellant does
      refer to his time whilst he lived in Iraq and, in particular, that  he
      had a boyfriend for about a year whilst doing  his  military  service.
      At paras 4-5, the appellant says this:

           "4.   When I was 16-17 years old I had a couple of  friends  who
                 were like me and we used to  meet  up  with  some  slightly
                 younger effeminate boys and practice sex  with  them  about
                 once or twice a week.  20 years ago the situation was  much
                 better.  Now, if they find out about any type of activities
                 like that they will kill both of you without question.

           5.    It was easier then because when we were in school we  were
                 together all the time  and  would  mix  together.   When  I
                 finished school and did military service things became more
                 difficult. I used to have a boyfriend  at  that  time,  for
                 about a year.  It was a secret relationship.  He was also a
                 soldier, but he was working in the kitchen cooking for  the
                 officers."

  21. At paragraph 7, the appellant also states:

           "7.   There were rumours of my sexuality back in  my  home  area
                 and when I finished my military service I tried to  rent  a
                 room away from my family.  I left Iraq in 1999 and went  to
                 live in Jordan because I found life difficult  to  live  in
                 Iraq, for everything, including my sexuality."

  22. As regards his time in Holland, the appellant says at para 8:

           "8.   Even in Holland I considered my sexuality a secret.  There
                 were a lot of Middle Eastern and Arabic people there.  Also
                 it is my private life so I didn't like people to know about
                 it - I didn't talk about  these  things.   In  general  the
                 Europeans  are  nice  people  and  respect  other  people's
                 rights, and they don't judge you  harshly  like  Iraqis  or
                 other Middle Eastern communities."

  23. In his statement of 2  December  2013,  the  appellant  describes  his
      situation in the UK at paragraphs 11-13:

           "11.  It is very hard to describe the feelings, but I have  felt
                 shame and isolation as a result of my  sexuality,  both  in
                 Iraq and in Europe.  The problem is even here I don't  have
                 the freedom because I cannot work and I cannot move out  of
                 Plymouth so it is very difficult for me  to  feel  like  an
                 ordinary human being capable of forming  relationships  and
                 being open about it.  Plymouth is a small city with a small
                 community of Arabs and Muslims.  There is  a  small  asylum
                 seeker and refugee community that  I  am  associated  with;
                 everybody knows each other and people gossip.   I  live  in
                 NASS accommodation with other asylum seekers, some of  whom
                 are Arabic and their other friends come over and  it  would
                 spread very quickly  if  I  ever  invited  a  boyfriend  or
                 potential boyfriend back to my place.

             12. I am not in a relationship at  the  moment.   I  am  always
                 optimistic and think maybe next week I will  meet  someone.
                 I have been to a local gay community group twice but I find
                 they are all younger than me and it is  very  difficult  to
                 understand each  other,  for  both  language  and  cultural
                 reasons.  They are a bit closed and I think they prefer  to
                 have relationships  amongst  each  other  and  not  with  a
                 foreigner.  There is a stigma attached to being  an  asylum
                 seeker.

             13. I don't like the other Arabic people in  Plymouth  to  know
                 about my sexuality. I don't have much friendship with those
                 people because they talk about religion  and  politics  and
                 these things do not interest me.   I  want  to  move  to  a
                 bigger city where I can meet more  people  like  me.   It's
                 very depressing for me here in Plymouth. "

  24. This statement makes no reference to a  relationship  with  a  man  in
      Plymouth which the appellant told us about in his oral evidence.

  25. It is not a matter of dispute that the appellant did not disclose  (or
      rely upon) his sexual orientation to the authorities in Holland  prior
      to his removal in August 2011 and that he raised it for the first time
      in his evidence submitted to the First-tier Tribunal.   The  appellant
      made no reference to it in his screening or  asylum  interviews  on  2
      December 2011 and 13 December 2011 respectively.  At para  14  of  his
      statement dated 2 December 2013, the appellant explains why he did not
      disclose this aspect of his asylum claim sooner as follows:

           "14.  I did not disclose my sexuality as part of my asylum claim
                 sooner because I was ashamed and scared to disclose it.   I
                 have heard stories of what has happened to people  in  Iraq
                 when people find out they are  gay.   I  could  never  come
                 clean even in the UK because I  would  be  shunned  by  the
                 group of people I know from the Arab and  Muslim  community
                 in Plymouth. I have never liked to talk about it -  I  have
                 always tried to hide it.  I have never felt  like  I  could
                 ever talk to anyone about it.  The reason I disclosed it to
                 my solicitor before my hearing was because I was  tired  of
                 fighting it.  I felt a lot of pressure on me I just decided
                 to tell my solicitor the truth.  I wanted somewhere safe to
                 live."

      Oral Evidence

  26. In his oral  evidence  to  this  Tribunal,  the  appellant  was  asked
      questions about any gay relationship that he had in Holland.   In  his
      evidence, he explained that he had had a relationship with a man  name
      "Jack".  He was Dutch and came from Rotterdam.  He said  that  he  met
      "Jack" when "Jack" worked for an organisation  helping  refugees.   He
      said that they had a relationship for about 2� to 3 months.  In answer
      to questions put to the appellant by the Tribunal, the appellant  said
      that he could not remember the full name of "Jack".  He said that  the
      relationship had been in 2007 and "Jack" had given him  a  home  after
      which they lived together for 2� months or thereabouts.    When  asked
      what interests they  shared,  the  appellant  said  that  they  talked
      together, sometimes they drank together  and  sometimes  he  expressed
      sympathy and he gave love to him.  He said that they spoke together in
      the Dutch language - "a little bit not  much".    The  appellant  said
      that the relationship came to an end when "Jack" left  the  appellant.
      He had last spoken to "Jack" in 2007.

  27. In re-examination, the appellant was asked why he had given  the  name
      of the man with whom he had had a  relationship  in  Holland  as  both
      "Jan" and "Jack".  The appellant replied that the  European  name  was
      different from the Arabic name and he could not remember.

  28. In his oral evidence, the  appellant  said  that  he  had  had  a  gay
      relationship with a man in the UK.   The  relationship  had  been  for
      about one week in 2012.  The appellant said that it was with a man who
      had come from Newcastle as a tourist to Plymouth.   They met in a bar.
       The appellant said that he could not remember the man's name - he had
      given three names and the appellant did not  remember  which  was  the
      truth.  The appellant said that the man was staying in a hotel but had
      told the appellant not to come there; he would come to the  appellant.
      The appellant confirmed that the man had visited him where  he  lived.
      When asked whether they  had  lived  together  for  the  week  of  the
      holiday, the appellant replied "three days".  The appellant said  that
      after the man returned to Newcastle he had been in touch with him  but
      the appellant had lost  his  mobile  phone  which  contained  all  his
      telephone numbers.

  29. In answer to questions from the  Tribunal,  the  appellant  said  that
      although  the  man  from  Newcastle  had  visited  him  at  his   NASS
      accommodation  in  Plymouth  he  had  not  slept  there.    When   the
      appellant's attention was drawn to a sentence in paragraph 11  of  his
      second statement that "it would spread very quickly if I ever  invited
      a boyfriend or potential boyfriend back to my  place",  the  appellant
      said that he did not wish to add anything.

  30. In re-examination, the appellant was asked why,  if  he  had  concerns
      about other people seeing him, he had invited the man  from  Newcastle
      back to his accommodation.  The  appellant  said  that  the  time  was
      suitable and there was nobody at the house.  He  said  that  he  would
      like to have had sex with the man, that was why he called him  to  the
      house, but they did not have sex.  The appellant said that  the  three
      Iranians in the house went to school to study English.

  31. In his oral evidence, the appellant said that he  had  first  realised
      that he was gay when he was in Iraq as a child. He said  that  he  was
      more attracted to men than women. He said that  he  was  approximately
      fourteen years old.  When it was put to the appellant that  Dr  George
      in his report of 23 May  2013  states,  in  his  narrative,  that  the
      appellant had said that it was "while in Holland that he became  aware
      that he was homosexual" (see para 111 of Dr George's report at A45  of
      the FtT bundle), the appellant said that he could not remember talking
      about this to Dr George. He said that he  had  a  mental  problem  and
      couldn't sleep for long and that he took tablets to make him sleep.

  32. In his oral evidence, the appellant was asked whether he had had a gay
      relationship before he went to Holland in Iraq.  He  replied  that  he
      had whilst he was in the army.

  33. When asked about para 8 of his statement where he said that in Holland
      he considered "my sexuality a secret", the appellant said that he  was
      very serious about keeping it secret.  People didn't like it.  He said
      that he knew that the police would protect him but he had to  keep  it
      secret.  His sexuality was not acceptable in  his  culture  and  there
      were many Arabs around in Holland.

  34. The appellant was asked why he had not claimed asylum  in  Holland  on
      the basis of his sexual orientation before his removal  in  2011.   He
      said that it would be a  stigma  for  him  to  announce  that  he  was
      homosexual.  He was scared of people in Holland.   They had put him in
      prison and he would rather go to Iraq.  When he was asked  whether  he
      would have preferred to go to Iraq, he said "No".  He  added  that  he
      could not claim asylum on the basis of his sexuality  because  it  was
      "so shameful for me".   When asked why he was able to claim asylum  on
      that basis now, he said that his "mentality is becoming very bad"  and
      that he did not feel well and that is why he  has  had  to  say  these
      things to protect himself.

  35. In answer to questions from the Tribunal, the appellant said  that  he
      was now prepared to talk about these matters because when he went back
      to Iraq his condition became worse and worse.  He said that he had not
      had time to speak about his health condition at  the  first  Tribunal.
      He said that he had told  his  solicitor  about  his  health  and  his
      solicitor had had all the papers  about  his  health  condition.   The
      appellant gave evidence about how he  had,  since  2011,  been  taking
      medicines prescribed by his doctor in Plymouth.  He took the medicines
      for about nine months but he became tired and he stopped  taking  them
      about one year ago.  He explained that he had had a  problem  sleeping
      but that had improved when he stopped taking the medicine after  about
      one year.  Then, the appellant said, he had developed a  problem  with
      his neck.

The Submissions

  36. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Hoshi  invited  us  to  find  that  the
      appellant was credible. He  accepted  that  there  were  a  number  of
      adverse credibility findings made by Judge Troup which had been upheld
      by the UT on  appeal.   Nevertheless,  Mr  Hoshi  submitted  that  the
      appellant was credible on his sexual orientation.  He  submitted  that
      the appellant had grown up in a culture where being gay was  bordering
      on being seen as abhorrent and would result in serious  ill-treatment.
      It was only now, Mr Hoshi submitted, that the appellant  was  able  to
      give details because he felt sufficiently comfortable to  do  so.   Mr
      Hoshi said that although the appellant had been given the  opportunity
      to give details at the FtT's hearing, he had explained credibly why he
      had failed to do so.  Mr Hoshi submitted  that  we  should  not  count
      against the appellant that he  had  made  a  piecemeal  revelation  of
      matters relating to his sexual identity.  It was only now that it  was
      necessary for the appellant to reveal all in order to remain safe.

  37. Mr Hoshi referred us to a number of documents set out at  paras  21-24
      of his skeleton argument which  emphasised  the  difficulty  faced  by
      asylum seekers in revealing sensitive matters  such  as  their  sexual
      orientation.  Mr Hoshi invited us to take into account  the  views  of
      Sheri Laizer in  her  report  dated  27  November  2013  that  it  was
      plausible that the appellant would become engaged or married in  order
      not to draw attention to his sexual orientation.

  38. Mr Hoshi invited us to find the appellant credible and find that he is
      gay and, as a result of Mr Richards position on the objective risk  to
      a gay man in Iraq, to find that  the  appellant  had  established  his
      claim.

  39. Mr Richards submitted that the FtT Judge had found that the  appellant
      was someone who told lies.   At  para  41  of  the  determination,  Mr
      Richards pointed out that the Judge had said that the appellant  "lied
      and attempted to duck and dive in an effort to bolster his case".   Mr
      Richards pointed out that the appellant had raised the  issue  of  his
      sexual orientation only as part of the FtT's proceedings.  He had  not
      raised it before his removal from Holland  in  2011  and  he  had  not
      raised it in any of his interviews with the Home Office.  Mr  Richards
      pointed out that the appellant still maintained, in  his  more  recent
      statement, the fiction that he was not married despite the finding  of
      Judge Troup (which stood) that he was, in fact, married.

  40. Mr Richards  pointed  out  that  there  were  inconsistencies  in  the
      appellant's   evidence,   in   particular   concerning   his   claimed
      relationship in Holland with a man he called either  "Jan"  or  "Jack"
      and there were discrepancies as to the length  of  that  relationship.
      Mr Richards also pointed out that in his first witness  statement  the
      appellant said that he went to gay pubs and bars and yet, in his  more
      recent statement, he says that in Holland "I considered my sexuality a
      secret".  Mr  Richards  pointed  out  that  there  was  no  supporting
      evidence from anyone in the UK as to the appellant's sexuality.   That
      was a relevant matter to be taken into account.  Mr  Richards  invited
      us to look at the whole of the  evidence  and  to  conclude  that  the
      appellant was not to be believed.

Discussion and Findings

  41. In reaching our assessment of credibility, we do so in the context  of
      the background material and expert report on the cultural  and  social
      attitudes to homosexuality in Iraq.  We bear in mind what Sheri Laizer
      says in her report at para 3(viii):

           "Today there  is  no  place  for  open  homosexuality  in  Iraq.
           Various militant Islamic groups consider homosexuality  a  grave
           sin and would take it upon themselves to kill the offender.  Gay
           men cannot now risk 'coming out' at all and there can be no open
           gay scene....any acts between men would place them in  the  most
           grave danger."

  42. We also bear in mind what Ms Laizer says at para 4(i) that:

           An Iraqi male would be taking  a  grave  risk  to  claim  to  be
           homosexual even outside Iraq any way in the Diaspora aware  that
           his  countrymen,  if  aware,   will   report   back   to   their
           neighbourhood and those that know the person concerned.  If, and
           when, that person returns to their family or social circle  word
           would likely have preceded him..."

  43. We also bear in mind the policy guidance documents to which  Mr  Hoshi
      referred us in  paras  21-24  of  his  skeleton  argument  (see,  'The
      Protection of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Asylum-
      Seekers and Refugees', UNHCR 22 September 2013, Supp bundle pages  C1-
      C18; 'Missing the Mark: Decision-making on  LGBT  Asylum  Claims',  UK
      Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, September 2013, Supp  bundle  pages
      C19-C48); 'Guidelines on Claims to  Refugee  Status  based  on  Sexual
      Orientation and/or Gender Identity within the context of Article 1A(2)
      of the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol relating to the Status
      of Refugees', UNHCR Supp bundle pages C49-C65, especially C65-C67; 'No
      Going Back: Lesbian and Gay people and the Asylum  System',  Stonewall
      May 2010, Supp bundle pages C66-C101).

  44. Those documents point out that many asylum seekers may have difficulty
      in revealing  their  true  sexual  orientation  whether  because  they
      frequently keep those aspects of their lives secret whether out  of  a
      sense of shame or stigma that would  be  attached  to  them  if  their
      sexual orientation became known.  That  is,  perhaps,  a  strengthened
      reluctance when an  individual  comes  from  a  culture  such  as  the
      appellant's  where  religious,  cultural  and  societal   norms   view
      homosexuality as abhorrent or worse.

  45. Nevertheless, for the following reasons, we are not satisfied  on  the
      evidence that the appellant is credible and we find that  he  has  not
      established that he is gay.

  46. First, the appellant has been found by the  FtT  to  have  lied  about
      virtually all aspects of his asylum claim.   Judge  Troup  stated,  at
      para 41 of his determination that:

           "[the appellant] has lied and attempted to duck and dive  in  an
           effort to bolster his case."

  47. Judge Troup concluded that the appellant had fabricated his account of
      being at risk in Iraq as a result of his association with a journalist
      who had written articles critical of an organisation violently opposed
      to the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq.  Before the FtT,  Mr  Hoshi  did
      not  rely  upon  four  documents  submitted  by  the  appellant.   The
      appellant's own  expert,  Dr  George  considered  that  two  of  these
      documents were "highly likely to be counterfeit" and a third "may well
      be counterfeit too".  The appellant has demonstrably lied  about  much
      of his claim.

  48. The Judge also found that the appellant, contrary to his claim at  the
      hearing, had in fact married an Iraqi woman in Syria in  2009.   Judge
      Troup's findings, which stands as a result of this Tribunal's  initial
      decision, was made despite the appellant's claim that he had, in fact,
      only been engaged to the woman.  That  is  a  false  claim  which  the
      appellant continues to advance, even in  the  face  of  that  judicial
      finding, in his witness statement of 2 December 2013.

  49. Secondly, whilst we accept that an asylum seeker might be reluctant to
      disclose the sensitive information concerning his sexual  orientation,
      the appellant has had a number of opportunities to do  so  since  2010
      when his residence permit to live in Holland was  withdrawn.   Despite
      the threat of removal to Iraq, the appellant did not mention (or  rely
      upon) his claimed sexual orientation to the Dutch  authorities  or  in
      the ensuing judicial proceedings at any  time  after  his  arrival  in
      Holland in January 2006 and before his  removal  on  16  August  2011.
      Despite the fear of being killed on return to Iraq, the appellant made
      no mention of any aspect  of  his  claim  (as  now  made  before  this
      Tribunal) based upon his being gay.   He  made  no  reference  to  any
      relationship, whilst he lived in Iraq, with a soldier  whilst  he  was
      doing his national service.  He made no mention  of  his  relationship
      with a man in Holland or of his fear  which,  he  now  claims  in  his
      supplementary statement, caused him to leave Iraq in 1999  and  go  to
      live in Jordan because there were rumours of his sexuality in his home
      area, making him fear serious harm if he returned.

  50. Thirdly, the appellant made no mention of his sexual  orientation  nor
      placed any reliance upon it when  he  claimed  asylum  in  the  UK  in
      December 2011.  It was raised for  the  first  time  in  his  evidence
      presented to the FtT at its hearing on 4  June  2013  in  his  witness
      statement dated 22 May 2013 at paras 10-11.

  51. We do not accept the appellant's evidence that  he  did  not  disclose
      this basis for his claim until, in effect, the  appeal  proceeding  in
      the UK out of shame or because his  mental  health  had  deteriorated.
      Although there is evidence that  the  appellant  suffered  from  sleep
      difficulties and, perhaps, some mental health issues, the  appellant's
      own evidence was that he stopped taking  any  medication  (apart  from
      problems concerned with pain in his neck) about 12 months ago.  We  do
      not accept that the appellant's condition deteriorated in  the  window
      of time prior to the FtT's hearing such that, for the first time,  the
      appellant felt compelled to reveal (for fear of return to  Iraq)  that
      he was gay.  It is wholly implausible, in our judgement, that  if  the
      appellant's account were true he would not have mentioned it  earlier,
      in particular in the course of the Dutch proceedings given that he was
      at risk of return to  Iraq  and,  in  fact,  that  is  precisely  what
      happened.

  52. Fourthly, in a number of respects we  find  the  appellant's  evidence
      highly unsatisfactory.  His evidence about his relationship with a man
      in Holland is confused.  In his first statement he refers  to  him  as
      "Jan" but in his evidence before us he  referred  to  him  as  "Jack".
      Despite claiming that they lived together, during their  relationship,
      the appellant used different names for his  claimed  partner  and  was
      unaware of his surname.  The appellant's evidence is also inconsistent
      on the length of the relationship.  In his first  statement,  he  says
      the relationship was for 8 months (see para 11) whilst in his evidence
      before us he said that the relationship was between 2� and  3  months.
      The alleged abrupt loss of contact between the two persons is  another
      telling factor. The vagueness and inconsistencies in  the  appellant's
      evidence in respect of his claimed relationship in Holland lead us  to
      reject  his  evidence  in  that  respect.    Likewise,  self-evidently
      contradictory, he claimed to keep his sexual orientation a "secret" in
      Holland and yet he says he attended gay bars and clubs.

  53. In addition, the appellant claims in his statement of 25 May 2013 that
      the relationship with "Jan" was "my first  relationship  with  another
      man".  Yet in his more recent statement and evidence  before  us,  the
      appellant claims that he had had a relationship with another  man  for
      about one year whilst he was doing his military service in  Iraq.   No
      mention of that is made in his earlier  statement  and  it  is  wholly
      inconsistent with his evidence in that statement that it was not until
      he was in Holland that he had his "first  relationship"  with  another
      man.

  54. Likewise Dr George  notes  in  his  report  (at  para  111)  that  the
      appellant told him that:

           "He had always been confused about his sexuality, and that while
           in Holland he became aware that he was homosexual."

  55. In his evidence, the appellant claimed that he could not recall saying
      this to Dr George.  There is no reason to doubt Dr George's  statement
      of what the appellant told him.  Now, of course, the appellant  claims
      that he had a "boyfriend" for about one  year  in  Iraq  whilst  doing
      military service.  That cannot  be  reconciled  with  the  appellant's
      statement to Dr George that he only became aware of his  homosexuality
      subsequently when in Holland.

  56. As regards his time in the United  Kingdom,  the  appellant  makes  no
      mention whatsoever either in his statement of 22 May 2013 or that of 2
      December 2013 of his claimed relationship (albeit brief)  with  a  man
      from Newcastle in 2012.  Whilst that relationship  may  not  have  yet
      occurred when the appellant made his  first  statement  in  May  2013,
      there is no suggestion that it occurred subsequent to his statement on
      2 December 2013.  Yet, in his oral evidence the  appellant  said  that
      such a relationship had occurred for a brief period  during  the  week
      that the man was a tourist in Plymouth where the appellant lived.

  57. We found wholly unpersuasive the appellant's  evidence  that,  despite
      saying in his written statement that it was not possible to  invite  a
      boyfriend back to his NASS accommodation, he had been able  to  invite
      this man back because the other residents were out studying.   In  any
      event, the appellant's evidence about this  claimed  relationship  was
      entirely vague. He was unable  to  name  the  man  concerned  who,  he
      claimed, came from Newcastle, simply saying that  he  had  been  given
      three names and did not know which  one  was  the  truth.   We  reject
      outright his claims to have had a relationship in the United Kingdom.

  58. Fifthly, despite living in the UK for 2 years, the appellant  was  not
      in a position to call a single witness to support his claim that he is
      gay (see TK (Burundi) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 40 at [16]).

  59. Sixthly, even since the appellant has  disclosed  his  claimed  sexual
      orientation he has sought to enhance his  evidence  adding  to  it  in
      piecemeal fashion  so  as  to  bolster  his  claim  for  international
      protection. When pressed on the  detail  of  his  story  in  his  oral
      evidence, the appellant's evidence was sometimes vague  and  sometimes
      inconsistent with what he had previously said (see above).

  60. We do not accept that, despite the sensitivity of the information, the
      appellant, if genuine, would not have raised as  part  of  his  asylum
      claim and in the appeals process in Holland that he feared  return  to
      Iraq on the basis of his sexual orientation.  Further, having  already
      been returned to Iraq, we do not accept that the appellant  would  not
      raise the issue of his sexual orientation until immediately  prior  to
      the FtT's  hearing.

  61. For all these reasons, looking at the evidence in the round and in the
      context of the background material, we find that the appellant is  not
      a credible witness.  The appellant is not a  person  of  credit  whose
      evidence can be relied upon.  We reject the  appellant's  evidence  of
      his sexual orientation.  In our judgment, the appellant has fabricated
      this account to seek, as a last ditch effort, to remain in the UK.  He
      has failed  to  establish  that  he  is  gay  as  claimed  and,  as  a
      consequence, is at risk on return to Iraq.

Decision

  62. Consequently, the appellant has failed to establish that he is at risk
      of persecution as a member of a PSG or  of  serious  ill-treatment  or
      harm contrary to Art 3 of the ECHR.

  63. The appellant's appeal is dismissed on all grounds.
