Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss. Petterson, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Mr. R. Solomon, Counsel.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. No application has been made previously for an anonymity order in these
    proceedings and there is no reason why such  an  order  should  now  be
    made.

 2. The appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.  However, for the sake of clarity I shall use the titles by
    which the parties were known before the First-tier Tribunal,  with  the
    Secretary of State referred to as "the respondent" and Mrs Pathmanathan
    as "the appellant".

 3. The appellant was born on 30 November 1983 is a citizen of  Sri  Lanka.
    She appealed against a decision of the respondent dated 28 October 2013
    to refuse her application for entry clearance as a  partner  under  the
    provisions of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  In giving  reasons
    for his decision the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  drew  attention  to  a
    perceived lack  of  documentation  demonstrating  contact  between  the
    appellant and her husband and reached the conclusion that  he  was  not
    satisfied that she and her husband were in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  therefore  refused  the
    appellant's  application  by  reference  to  paragraph  EC-P.1.1(d)  of
    Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as  amended).   The
    respondent went on to consider the appellant's position in relation  to
    the financial requirements of Appendix FM and noted  that  the  sponsor
    had a full-time job with Silk Motor Fuels and a part-time job with  VSR
    Services.  The ECO noted that one payment of  salary  from  Silk  Motor
    Fuels during the relevant period was not  evidenced  in  the  sponsor's
    bank account and that there was no evidence of receipt of  salary  from
    VSR Services in the bank statements.  The ECO therefore considered that
    he was unable to take into account the sponsor's second  salary  toward
    the income threshold.  Nevertheless he made no final  determination  in
    that regard pending the Secretary of State's appeal in  relation  to  a
    legal challenge to the income threshold requirement.

 4. The appellant lodged notice  of  appeal  supported  by  a  considerable
    amount of documentary evidence.  There was firstly a substantial volume
    of evidence with regard to the contact between the parties.  As to  the
    financial requirement it was argued that the respondent had  failed  to
    consider all the documents that had been submitted and that the sponsor
    did in fact meet the requirements of  the  gross  income  threshold  of
    �18,600.

 5. The Entry Clearance Manager reviewed the application in  light  of  the
    new material.  Having regard to the evidence of  contact  he  confirmed
    that he was prepared to accept that the appellant and  her  UK  sponsor
    did enter into a genuine  marriage  and  that  their  relationship  was
    subsisting.  As to the financial requirements he confirmed that he  had
    verified that the payment for June 2013 from Silk Motor Fuels had  been
    credited to the sponsor's bank account.  Nevertheless he was still  not
    prepared to take into account the earnings from  VSR  Services  because
    there was an apparent discrepancy between the earnings mentioned in the
    P60 and none of the payslips prior to May 2013 were  reflected  in  the
    sponsor's bank statements.

 6. The appellant's appeal was heard at Hatton Cross on 23 October 2014 and
    in a decision promulgated on 7 November 2014 Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Blandy allowed the appellant's appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 7. The respondent sought permission to appeal  and  this  was  granted  by
    Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Garratt in a decision on  5
    January 2015.  His reasons for so doing were:

         "1.   The  respondent  applies  in  time  to  appeal  against   the
             determination of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Blandy  in
             which he allowed  the  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
             respondent  to  refuse  entry  clearance  as  a   partner   in
             accordance with the provisions of Appendices FM and  FM-SE  of
             the Immigration Rules.

         2.   The grounds contend that the judge was wrong to conclude  that
             the respondent  should  have  exercised  discretion  when  the
             specific requirements of Appendix FM  and  Appendix  FM-SE  in
             relation to income for the appellant and sponsor had not  been
             complied with.  In particular  the  appellant  had  failed  to
             provide payslips covering the six month period  required  and,
             in relation to second employment, no  bank  statements  showed
             income from that source as required by Appendix FM-SE.

         3.    The  grounds  are  arguable.   In  circumstances  where   the
             appellant  and  sponsor  had  failed  to  meet  the   specific
             requirements of the Rules it is arguable that  the  judge  was
             wrong to allow the appeal despite that failure.

         4.   Permission is granted."

 8. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 9. Miss Petterson, in  making  her  submissions,  relied  on  the  grounds
    submitted to the Tribunal.  She firstly contended that the  Immigration
    Rules relating to specified evidence are  comprehensively  set  out  in
    Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration  Rules.   In  dealing
    with this appeal the judge has  wrongly  ignored  the  requirements  in
    coming to the findings that  he  did.   The  appellant  had  failed  to
    provide payslips covering the entire six month period as required under
    Appendix FM-SE in relation to his second part-time job,  with  payslips
    missing.  Further prior to May 2013 nothing  had  been  paid  into  the
    sponsor's account from this second part-time employment  and  therefore
    as six months of income at least could not be shown the appellant could
    not seek to rely on this employment when attempting to demonstrate  the
    financial requirements were met.  For  this  employment  to  have  been
    taken into account it had to be demonstrated that it had  been  ongoing
    for at least six months and as he had failed to do so it meant that  no
    income from the second part-time job could be taken  into  account  for
    the purposes of the financial requirements calculation.

10. Where a sponsor is paid in cash for the gross income to be  taken  into
    account all of  the  monies  received  from  employment  must  be  paid
    directly into the bank.  This is a mandatory requirement.   Where  only
    part of the money is deposited then only the net amount  deposited  can
    be counted when calculating the income for the purposes of meeting  the
    financial requirements.  The respondent asserts that the  judge  failed
    to properly explore this  and  that  there  was  a  lack  of  specified
    evidence submitted to substantiate the  claimed  income  based  on  the
    operating principles of Appendix  FM-SE.   This  is  an  appellant  who
    cannot meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE for the six month period
    prior to the date of application.  It is a  mandatory  requirement  and
    therefore the appeal should have been dismissed under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

11. Mr Solomon argued that the judge had  not  erred  as  asserted  by  the
    respondent.  The decision date is 28 October 2013 and it was  incumbent
    upon the judge to apply the Immigration Rules as they stood at the date
    of that decision.  In seeking permission to appeal the  respondent  has
    relied on an Immigration Rule that was not inserted until 6 April 2014.
     The appeal should have been allowed.

12. I likewise find  that  the  judge  has  not  erred  in  coming  to  the
    conclusions that he did.  They are cogent and reasoned.  He found  that
    the average gross monthly salary from Silk  Motor  Fuels  for  the  six
    month period prior to the submission of the application  was  �1,302.48
    resulting in an annual gross income from that company of  twelve  times
    that figure, making a total of �15,629.76.  The judge acknowledged that
    that fell short of the requirement of �18,600  and  so  turned  to  the
    issue of the earnings from VSR Services.   The  judge  found  that  the
    appellant submitted  a  document  that  did  not  contain  all  of  the
    specified information, namely the sponsor's bank statements  which  did
    not contain corroboration of his earnings from  VSR  Services  for  the
    month of January 2013 to May  2013  inclusive.   However  that  missing
    information was verifiable from  other  documents  submitted  with  the
    application which the judge found to be genuine.  The judge  also  took
    into account the fact that some of the payments were made in  cash  and
    ultimately concluded at paragraph 18 of his decision that  this  was  a
    case in which the respondent should have exercised discretion in favour
    of the appellant.  It was clear that the great majority of  the  income
    requirement  of  the  sponsor  was  properly  documented  but  only   a
    relatively small proportion of the income required did not have all the
    proper documentation.  It is plain that the more onerous demands of the
    Immigration Rules were not inserted until 6 April  2014  and  therefore
    contrary to the respondent's arguments did not bite on  the  individual
    facts of this appeal.  In applying the Immigration Rules as at the date
    of decision the judge has correctly come to conclusions that were  open
    to be made on the totality of the  evidence  and  allowing  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

The appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
