                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The appellant, a citizen of Algeria, appeals against the determination
      of an Adjudicator (Mr Malcolm Rothwell) dismissing his appeal  against
      the refusal of the Secretary of State to  grant  his  application  for
      asylum.

   2.  The  appellant  was  represented  by  Miss  P  Mansoor,  of  Counsel,
      instructed by Ahmed & Co, Solicitors, while Mr I Graham,  Home  Office
      Presenting Officer, represented the Secretary of State.

   3. Leave to appeal to the Tribunal was granted by the Tribunal  (Mr  M  W
      Rapinet, Vice President) on 1 July 2002.

   4. In granting leave to appeal, the Tribunal stated as follows:

      "It is arguable that  having  accepted  that  20  of  the  applicant's
      colleagues had been murdered, the Adjudicator erred in  rejecting  the
      applicant's claim that he was in  danger.   Whether  such  risk  still
      subsists in Algeria now is a matter which the  Tribunal  may  wish  to
      consider, notwithstanding the consideration given to  this  aspect  by
      the Adjudicator."

   5. When the appeal opened before the Tribunal, on 30  August  2002,  Miss
      Mansoor put in a number  of  documents  including  the  chronology  of
      events, among which were the US State Department report, a  number  of
      extracts from various publications, relating to the  situation  facing
      journalists in Algeria in recent times, and the CIPU report  of  April
      2002, from which she quoted pertinent  passages  and  submitted  that,
      even though the appellant had been a journalist between 1993 and 1999,
      before he had left Algeria, the situation in Algeria  was  as  serious
      now as it was then and was even more serious,  having  regard  to  the
      fact that, on  27  June  2001  the  Government  enacted  a  series  of
      amendments to the Penal Code that gave  the  government  authority  to
      impose high fines and harsh jail sentences in cases in which reporters
      "defame, insult or injure" government officials, and, where,  although
      no journalists had been charged under the new law, the Government  had
      brought several defamation cases against journalists during  the  year
      under the old provisions of the Penal Code.

   6. She drew our attention to an  extract  from  "World  News"  which  had
      stated that 70 journalists, photographers  and  associated  staff  had
      lost their lives in Algeria since May 1993, that  their  killers  were
      armed Islamic groups, who had won an election in 1991,  but  had  been
      forbidden from taking power by the secular military backed regimes and
      that journalists had often been critical of both  sides,  with  deadly
      results.  She  submitted  a  report  of  26  February  2002,  entitled
      "CPJ2002 Protest Letter", and where a report was made with  regard  to
      journalists who had been charged with defaming the army in an  article
      on  11  December,  by  accusing  the  military  police  of   financial
      misconduct and that, a week  earlier,  prosecutors  had  attempted  to
      reinstate a 1997 judgment against another journalist by  the  name  of
      Belhouchet, that resulted from statements he had made  to  the  French
      media asserting that government officials may  have  been  responsible
      for the murders  of  some  journalists  during  Algeria's  brutal  war
      between 1992 and 1995.  She submitted  that  Belhouchet,  in  November
      1997, had received a one year suspended sentence and appealed  against
      that decision and that although the Supreme Court did  not  allow  his
      appeal, it would appear that the suspension had  been  taken  off  the
      sentence and he had to undergo the imprisonment.

   7. She submitted that, as stated in Amnesty International  in  a  report,
      dated 19 April 2002, although little international attention  is  paid
      to the ongoing suffering of the Algerians, the bleak reality is that a
      human rights crisis continues to blight Algeria  with  the  number  of
      people killed each month by the security forces, State-armed  militias
      and armed combatants of the armed conflict,  remains  shockingly  high
      and that reports of torture and ill-treatment by the security  forces,
      including that of women and children as young as 15,  continue  to  be
      numerous and widespread.

   8. She submitted that even the CIPU  report,  itself,  stated  in  August
      1999, that President Bouteflika had stated  that  journalists  working
      for public radio and television should  serve  the  interests  of  the
      State and that the state of emergency gave the government broad rights
      to restrict freedom of speech.  She  submitted  that  the  documentary
      evidence  indicated  that  the   government   not   alone   persecuted
      journalists for recently written  articles,  but  persecuted  them  in
      respect of articles which had been written in the past.

   9. The main thrust of Miss Mansoor's submissions was that the  appellant,
      as a journalist, who had defamed the military in writing  the  article
      in a widely circulated daily newspaper in Algeria  and  who  had  been
      visited by unknown persons, and had  received  telephone  calls  which
      caused him to be in fear, sufficiently to make him leave  Algeria,  in
      view of the fact  that  a  number  of  his  colleagues  had  similarly
      received telephone calls and had been murdered, in all  circumstances,
      and in view of the fact that the  government  was  proceeding  against
      journalists who had written articles some years back,  he  would  face
      prosecution on that account and  that,  in  those  circumstances,  the
      Adjudicator was wrong to have found  otherwise  and  that  the  appeal
      should be allowed.

  10. We heard Mr Graham, in reply, and his submission was that although the
      citations from the objective evidence were  impressive,  nevertheless,
      one had to look at the subjective evidence  where  the  appellant  was
      concerned.   He  submitted  that,  while  the  appellant  had  been  a
      journalist between 1993 and 1997, on weekly newspapers in Algeria,  he
      wrote, mainly, on  social  issues  and  had  written  one  article  in
      November 1996, criticising the army for importing beer when  hospitals
      were short of supplies and that, in the following month, December, two
      men had come to his offices when he was out asking to see him, he  had
      been told that they were very aggressive and that he feared  who  they
      might be, but, although he claimed to have received numerous telephone
      calls, from people claiming that they wanted him to  help  them  write
      articles, they did not identify themselves, there was nothing  in  his
      evidence to indicate of whom he was in fear, and that  his  assumption
      was that it was the army, but there is no evidence whatsoever of that.



  11. He submitted that the Adjudicator had clearly considered  all  of  the
      evidence and he drew our attention to what he had found, at  paragraph
      4.10 of his determination, where he stated that although the appellant
      claimed to have a specific fear  as  a  journalist,  nevertheless  the
      Canada Report at page 17 stated that "it is striking to see how openly
      critical of government the Algerian press can be" and that in the USSD
      Report, at page 94 of the appellant's  bundle,  it  recorded  that  "A
      large number of independent press publications reported  regularly  on
      security matters without penalty", and at page 89, in the same report,
      it reported that  journalists  can  and  have  faced  prosecution  for
      defaming the government but there was no report of any assassination.

  12. He submitted that even the documents produced today, by Miss  Mansoor,
      indicated that the only punishment which any journalist would face, or
      had faced, was a fine or imprisonment for up to one year  and  a  fine
      which would not amount to persecution, and that it was clear from  the
      reports that journalists had the opportunity of recourse to the Courts
      for appeal.

  13. The gist of Mr Graham's submissions was that the Adjudicator had  come
      to the right decision on the evidence both subjective  and  objective,
      and that despite the wealth  of  extracts  from  journals  which  Miss
      Mansoor had put forward, and taking account of the  reason  given  for
      the grant of leave to  appeal,  although  twenty  of  the  appellant's
      colleagues had been murdered, it would not necessarily mean  that  the
      appellant was in danger  as,  in  his  particular  case,  he  had  not
      established a reason why he should be targeted either by the  military
      or by any terrorist group.  He submitted that  the  appeal  should  be
      dismissed.

  14. We then heard Miss Mansoor, in reply, and she drew our attention to  a
      number of extracts from her bundle,  to  the  effect  that  the  human
      rights situation in Algeria remained generally poor and  that  serious
      problems persisted, including the excessive use  of  force,  increased
      restrictions on freedom of expression and failure to account for  past
      disappearances.  She submitted that it was  stated  in  the  US  State
      Department report for 2001,  published  on  4  March  2002,  that  the
      security forces committed extra-judicial killings, tortured,  beat  or
      otherwise abused detainees and arbitrarily arrested  and  detained  or
      held individuals  incommunicado.   She  submitted  that  the  security
      forces continued to torture detainees who are suspected of involvement
      with, or with knowledge of,  the  armed  groups,  according  to  human
      rights lawyers, and that journalists were convicted in absentia.

  15. She submitted that the situation which the appellant would face if  he
      were returned, as a journalist, who,  in  the  past  had  defamed  the
      military, was such that he would face persecution on return both under
      the Refugee Convention and under the ECHR.

  16. We then reserved  our  determination,  carefully  considered  all  the
      evidence and the submissions made to us and  directed  ourselves  that
      the burden of proof lay upon the appellant and that  the  standard  of
      proof is that laid down by the House of Lords in Sivakumaran and  more
      recent decisions of the Courts and the Tribunal.

  17. The basis of the appellant's claim  for  asylum  in  this  appeal  is,
      briefly, that, as a journalist in  Algeria,  between  1993  and  1997,
      when, due to the political  situation  in  Algeria  a  number  of  the
      appellant's journalistic colleagues had been murdered, he had  written
      articles, in the Chorrouk newspaper and, in November 1996, had written
      a particular article in the same newspaper, under his own name,  which
      criticised the army for importing beer when hospitals  were  short  of
      supplies, that, in December 1996, two men came looking for  him,  that
      when he later saw them, he assumed they were  from  the  military  and
      that he had then received anonymous  telephone  calls,  all  of  which
      scared him, and, having gone to a remote town, where he  worked  as  a
      journalist  for  a  year,  before   becoming   a   teacher   and   had
      unsuccessfully tried to obtain a visa to  various  different  European
      countries, finally obtained a visa to go to France and left Algeria in
      November 2000,  for France from where he went to  the  United  Kingdom
      and sought asylum.

  18. When the appellant appealed against the refusal of his application for
      asylum in the  United  Kingdom,  the  Adjudicator,  having  heard  his
      evidence, and having considered the objective evidence  placed  before
      him, set out his reasons for not believing the appellant's story.   At
      paragraph 4.7 of his determination, the Adjudicator, on the subjective
      aspect, found as follows:

      "Moreover, there is some confusion in his interview about this at  C3.
      He said that in 1999, in addition to the 1996 incident, people came to
      his work whom he thought could be police or terrorists.   Furthermore,
      he said on the same page that "I was scared to death".   Yet  when  he
      was challenged  about  attributing  the  article  to  himself  in  the
      newspaper despite the prevailing climate of fear  for  journalists  he
      boldly said that he loved his job, he was not going to  stop  being  a
      journalist (which he did in 1999) and that "I insisted on  putting  my
      name to it even if I  was  going  to  die".   I  do  not  believe  the
      appellant.   That  completely  contradicts  his  claim  to  have  been
      mortally afraid and it makes no sense when it would have been possible
      to use a pseudonym or even no name at all.  He said that  in  response
      to this "threat" he changed his work  patterns  so  he  could  not  be
      found.  However, I do not find it credible that if he were  a  serious
      target for assassination he could  not  have  been  found  by  whoever
      wanted him, and that he would have continued  to  work  for  over  two
      years."

  19.  At  paragraph  4.8  and  paragraph  4.9  of  his  determination,  the
      Adjudicator, on the objective aspect, found as follows:

      "48 His own objective material undermines his story.  In  the  article
      referred to earlier starting at page 63 of the appellant's bundle, the
      writer states that as a result of these deaths and death threats "many
      journalists use pseudonyms".  At the end of that article on page 68 of
      the bundle it states that at that time (August 1998) "there  has  been
      an improvement in the security situation of late,  no  journalist  has
      been killed this year" and that "the majority remain wary".  The basis
      of their fears was apparently  fundamentalist  Muslim  groups.   Thus,
      even before the appellant  left  Algeria  there  was  a  reduction  in
      violence  against  journalists,  he  has  no  evidence  of  any  other
      instances to suggest there was any basis for  a  continuing  fear  (if
      there ever was) for him specifically, and he continued to  work  as  a
      journalist.  Even in evidence he could not assert that there  was  any
      group still interested in him, saying "they came once to get me.  They
      will get me because I haven't stopped working as a journalist and I am
      not going to".  Of course he did stop, which both supports  his  claim
      to fear and shows that he can avoid it.  At C4 of his interview he was
      extremely vague about his fears, saying he  had  "been  treated  in  a
      hostile way from the police who guarded buildings", but he  could  not
      remember when.  He gave no further specifics in his evidence  of  whom
      he feared or why.


      4.9. As for the objective evidence, it confirms that the worst of  the
      terrorist violence was between 1992 and 1997 (Canada Report  page  7).
      CIPU in Section B (page 18) notes that human rights abuse by  security
      forces continued to decline in 2000.  At B13  CIPU  states  that  most
      terrorist incidents took place in the countryside  because  the  large
      towns have been made safe, including Algiers, a  comment  repeated  at
      A6.  In the CIPU Bulletin at page 2 it states that "There is no  group
      that is persecuted in Algeria today";  but anyone who  challenged  the
      authorities "on a sensitive security issue" could be at risk.  Also on
      that  page  it  is  said  that  failed  returned  asylum  seekers  are
      considered to be safe and to  have  no  fear  of  repercussions.   The
      Canada Report also confirms at page 9 that no group is  persecuted  in
      Algeria today."

  20. The Adjudicator, then, at paragraph 4.12, found that the appellant had
      not established that he had a well-founded fear of persecution  for  a
      Convention Reason and went on to dismiss his appeal.

  21. The Adjudicator dealt with the human rights aspect and, relying on the
      decisions in R v  Secretary  of  State  ex-parte  Sarbjit  Singh,  and
      Ireland v United Kingdom, found that the appellant had not established
      past or prospective ill treatment such as to constitute  a  breach  of
      Articles 2, 3, 5, 8 and 10 of the ECHR.

  22. In view of the fact that, in granting leave to  appeal,  the  Tribunal
      had stated that it was arguable that the Adjudicator, having  accepted
      that twenty of the appellant's colleagues had been  murdered,  he  had
      erred in rejecting the appellant's claim that he  was  in  danger,  we
      were  addressed  at  length  by  Miss  Mansoor  on  the  situation  of
      journalists in Algeria, and she laid particular emphasis on what would
      face the appellant, as a journalist who had criticised the military in
      the past, if he were returned, now, to Algeria.

  23. We have, therefore, paid close attention to the subjective evidence of
      the appellant's activities as a journalist, before  he  left  Algeria,
      and the objective evidence of the situation, at present,  in  Algeria,
      where journalists are concerned, and on the  human  rights'  situation
      generally.

  24.  In  particular,  we  note,  and  in  the  course  of  Miss  Mansoor's
      submissions, we raised the point with her, that  the  appellant,  even
      though he practised journalism during  the  period  between  1993  and
      1997, when the fundamentalist terrorist groups were  at  their  worst,
      did not express any  fear  of  violence  or  death  from  them.   Miss
      Mansoor, although she based her case on the article by  the  appellant
      which was critical of the military, stated that he also had a fear  of
      the fundamentalists, but, we are not satisfied that that  is  so.   As
      far as the evidence goes, the appellant has, throughout,  stated  that
      he did not write articles on terrorist matters, because he was  not  a
      specialist in that field, but wrote on matters of social interest.  In
      our considered opinion, while we, as the Adjudicator did, accept  that
      journalist colleagues of the appellant had been murdered, we find that
      there was no reason for  the  appellant  to  fear  that  he  would  be
      murdered;  the only fear he has expressed is the fear that two unknown
      persons, whom he thought might be part of the military, were enquiring
      about him, and that he had received anonymous telephone calls.

  25. In our opinion, if it were members of the military who wished to  take
      action against the appellant on account of the article  which  he  had
      written in November 1996, it is difficult to see why they should  have
      had to resort to sending two people to speak to the appellant when, at
      the height of the terrorist disturbances going on at that  time,  they
      could have taken much more drastic action against the  appellant  and,
      if necessary, have blamed any such action on the terrorist groups.  We
      find that the appellant's story of the two men does not  stand  up  to
      any scrutiny, and we find it not to be true.

  26. In our considered opinion, while we accept that he wrote  the  article
      in question, we are not satisfied that  it  caused  him  to  fear  any
      persecution  by  anyone,  be  it  the   military   or   even   Islamic
      fundamentalists  We  are  satisfied  that  the  Adjudicator,  for  the
      detailed reasons he set out in his determination, came to the  correct
      conclusion in dismissing the appellant's appeal in paragraph  4.12  of
      the determination.

  27. And, in so concluding, we find  that,  while  20  of  the  appellant's
      journalistic colleagues  may  have  been  murdered,  they  were  in  a
      different  category  to  the  appellant,  and   wrote   on   terrorist
      activities, while the appellant, on his own evidence,  wrote  only  on
      social matters, and thus, would not have brought himself to the notice
      of  any  terrorist  fundamentalist  groups,  and  would  have  had  no
      reasonable degree of likelihood of being killed by them.

  28. On the question of what the appellant would be likely to face  on  his
      return to Algeria, we have taken note of the extracts from the various
      sources cited to us by Miss Mansoor.  As we  see  that  evidence,  and
      have considered it in the light of the fact that no  action  was  ever
      established to have been taken by the military against  the  appellant
      before he left Algeria in 1999, when the military could have done  so,
      we find that, even though the new legislation brought  into  force  in
      Algeria in June 2001, gave the government  authority  to  impose  high
      fines and harsh jail sentences  in  cases  where  reporters  "defamed,
      insulted or injured" government officials,  the  sentence  for  anyone
      defaming the President is only one of imprisonment  of  between  three
      and twelve months, and a fine of between 15,000 dinars and 250  dinars
      (approximately between �500 and  �2,500),  and  for  defamation  of  a
      Judge,  civil  servant  or  a  person  responsible  for  public  order
      (including, most likely, the military) the  sentence  is  imprisonment
      for between two and 24 months and a fine  between  10,000  dinars  and
      500,000 dinars.

  29. Further, it is stated in the US State Department report for 2001, that
      no journalist had been charged under the new law by the end  of  2001,
      although actions for defamation had  been  taken  against  journalists
      during the year under the old provisions.  However, even  when  action
      for defamation had been taken it would appear that any sentence passed
      did not exceed one year, and was usually suspended, as in the case  of
      the managing editor of the French language daily "l'Authentique" on 11
      July 2001, who, having failed to appear in  Court,  although  properly
      notified, was sentenced to a six month suspended sentence and  a  fine
      only.

  30. In these circumstances, and in view of what is reported in  the  Human
      Rights Watch World Report for 2002, namely that, although the  amended
      provisions of the Penal  Code  threatened  press  freedom,  newspapers
      continued  to  criticise  President  Bouteflika,  daily,  we  are  not
      satisfied that  the  appellant,  who  had  written  only  one  article
      critical of the military, in November 1996, and had  not  suffered  in
      any way as a result,  before  leaving  Algeria  in  1999,  would  face
      persecution on that account if he were now to return to Algeria,  and,
      even if he were to face any charge, or  to  be  sued  for  defamation,
      which we are satisfied that he would not,  any  sanction  or  sentence
      would be so low  as  not  to  amount  to  persecution  or  inhuman  or
      degrading treatment;  and, in any event, he would have recourse to the
      Courts for redress if he found the sentence or fine to be too harsh.

  31. Taking all the  evidence  into  account,  and  having  considered  the
      subjective and  the  objective  aspects,  we  find  that  we  are  not
      satisfied that the appellant  has  established  that  the  Adjudicator
      erred in dismissing his appeal under either Refugee Convention or ECHR
      grounds.  We find that the appellant has not established his  case  to
      the appropriate standard, set out earlier in this  determination,  and
      we dismiss this appeal.

  32. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
