Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr J Nicholson, instructed by GMIAU
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, MI, date of birth 1.1.57, is a citizen of Sudan.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Malik promulgated  13.2.15,  dismissing  on  all  grounds   his  appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  1.12.14,  to
    refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims, and
    to remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 29.1.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Robertson refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    11.3.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan granted permission to appeal  on
    3.6.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 18.12.15 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was an error  of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  the
    determination of Judge Malik should be set aside.

 6. The grounds of  appeal  seek  to  challenge  some  of  the  credibility
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, on the basis that the  judge
    failed to take into account matters that  were  material  to  a  proper
    assessment of the credibility of the appellant's account.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Canavan considered it at  least
    arguable that the judge may  have  placed  too  much  emphasis  on  the
    plausibility of various aspects of the evidence, some of which were not
    on the face of it inherently implausible. "For example, the finding  in
    relation to the relatively short delay of two weeks  before  an  arrest
    warrant was issued [60] was made without reference  to  any  background
    evidence as to what the procedures might  be  in  Sudan.  The  Tribunal
    should be cautious not to place undue weight on plausibility in  coming
    to adverse credibility findings: see HK v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 037  and
    Y v SSHD [2006] EWCA CIv 1223."

 8. For the most part I am not satisfied that these and similar  criticisms
    made of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  in  the  grounds  and
    reflected in the grant of  permission  are  well-founded.  Judge  Malik
    clearly made a careful and detailed assessment of all of  the  evidence
    and the reasons are cogently reasoned. I do not accept that  the  judge
    placed too much emphasis on the plausibility of various aspects of  the
    appellant's account.  The  various  inconsistencies  and  discrepancies
    highlighted by the judge were open to the Tribunal. As noted  by  Judge
    Robertson in refusing permission to appeal by the First-tier  Tribunal,
    the appellant did not claim  that  corrupt  officials  facilitated  his
    escape from detention; rather it was due to lax security. It  was  open
    to  the  judge  to  find  against  the  appellant  in  the  context  of
    inconsistencies and discrepancies between his evidence and that of  his
    witnesses, as set out at �55-64 of the decision. Other than the  matter
    set out below, I find that the findings were open to the judge and this
    part of the grounds does no more than  disagree  with  the  conclusions
    reached.

 9. At �55 of the decision Judge Malik was satisfied that the appellant was
    a member of the UNP, a registered opposition political party, with some
    2 million members. At �59 the  judge  did  not  accept  that  had  been
    extensively involved in a senior position in  the  party,  as  claimed.
    However, at �68 the judge repeated that it was accepted that he  was  a
    party member and that he may very well have  had  some  involvement  in
    party activities. "I also accept, as a member of an  opposition  party,
    this may have caused him to come to the attention  of  the  authorities
    and to be questioned by them." The  judge  found,  however,  that  this
    would not meet the threshold required to engage article 2  and  3,  but
    found that his account of having been detained  and  tortured  was  not
    credible.

10. The difficulty is that the OGN for  Sudan  at  section  3.11.16,  which
    appears at A63 in the appellant's bundle, states "Members of opposition
    groups  and   perceived   government   critics,   including   students,
    journalists and human rights defenders  are  subjected  to  harassment,
    intimidation, arbitrary arrest, incommunicado  detention,  and  are  at
    risk of ill-treatment and persecution. Each case should  be  considered
    on its individual merits, but claimants who fall into this category and
    can  show  that  they  have  come  to  the  adverse  attention  of  the
    authorities, or are reasonably likely to do so, are likely  to  qualify
    for asylum."

11. It does not appear that Judge Malik took  account  of  this  background
    material, which Mr McVeety confirms is still current.

12. At �3 of the grant of permission Judge Canavan  noted,  "The  appellant
    gave a detailed account of his political activities in Sudan, which was
    broadly supported by the evidence produced in support  of  the  appeal.
    Whilst the judge  noted  some  discrepancies  between  the  appellant's
    evidence and that given  by  other  witnesses  the  appellant  provided
    explanations for those discrepancies. The discrepancies,  taken  alone,
    were only likely to undermine one of the  claimed  detentions  but  not
    necessarily the other two periods of detention. The judge accepted that
    the appellant was an active member of the UNP [55] but at no pint  does
    he appear to assess the credibility of the  account  in  light  of  the
    background evidence relating to Sudan, which indicates  that  political
    opponents can be subject to detention without charge and may be at risk
    of serious ill-treatment if detained."

13. Unfortunately this criticism is well-founded and it  does  appear  that
    the judge failed to take into account matters that were highly material
    to a proper assessment of the overall credibility  of  the  appellant's
    account and the risk on return.

14. Despite the otherwise careful and detailed assessment of the  evidence,
    I am satisfied that the judge erred in part of the  assessment  of  the
    evidence and the credibility of the appellant in  failing  to  consider
    the risk on return of  serious  ill-treatment,  in  the  light  of  the
    acceptance that he is a party member and may  well  have  come  to  the
    adverse attention of the authorities. The credibility  of  the  account
    was not considered in the light of the OGN, as Mr McVeety accepts,  and
    I  thus  find  that  the  risk  of  ill-treatment  was  not  adequately
    addressed.

15. In the circumstances, this amounts  to  such  error  of  law  that  the
    decision must be regarded as flawed and cannot stand.

16. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of those issues.

17. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so, on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh, with no findings preserved.

Conclusions:

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the decision in the appeal to be remade  in  the
                    First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

19. The appeal is to be relisted in the First-tier Tribunal at  Manchester,
    with a time estimate of 4 hours;

20. No findings of fact are preserved and the appeal is to be heard afresh;

21. The appeal may be listed before any First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  except
    Judge Malik;

22.  An  interpreter  in  Arabic  will   be   required.   The   appellant's
    representative is to confirm in writing the need for an interpreter, as
    well as the language and dialect;

23. The appellant must serve not later than 14  days  before  the  relisted
    appeal a single, paginated and indexed bundle  of  all  subjective  and
    objective material relied on, together with any skeleton argument.  The
    Tribunal is unlikely to accept any late  served  material  or  skeleton
    argument.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  consider  it
appropriate to make anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee  award.
I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
