                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Ivory Coast who was born on  16th  of
    November 1984.

The appellant's immigration application

 2. The appellant applied for an EEA family permit on 28 March 2017. It  is
    an unfortunate feature of this appeal that the parties appear unable to
    agree  what  version  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
    Regulations (EEA Regulations) apply. That application was considered by
    the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) who, in a decision dated 12 May 2017,
    refused entry clearance to the UK. He referred to Regulations 7  and  8
    of the 2016 EEA Regulations. It appears from Halsbury's Statute Citator
    that the 2016 EEA Regulations came into force on 1st February 2017  and
    therefore that the ECO correctly considered the application  under  the
    2016 EEA Regulations. On 8 June 2017 the appellant appealed  the  ECO's
    refusal which triggered a review by the entry clearance  manager  (ECM)
    on 21 December 2017. The ECM considered whether the appellant qualified
    for an EEA family permit under  the  EEA  Regulations  2006  (correctly
    referred to in the earlier ECO's decision as the 2016 EEA Regulations).
    The  ECO  having  been  furnished  with  additional  evidence  was  not
    satisfied as to the appellant's relationship with the EEA  national  in
    question, his sister [OK], a French national who was born  on  27th  of
    July 1984 who lived in Beckenham, London (the  sponsor).  In  addition,
    the ECM did not  consider  the  appellant  to  be  "wholly  financially
    dependent" within the meaning of those regulations. The refusal was  on
    the grounds that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    regulation 8  (2)  of  the  2006  Regulations  (fortunately,  the  same
    regulation numbers apply in relation to both sets  of  regulations)  in
    that he was not a person who is dependent upon an  EEA  national  or  a
    member of his household the purposes  of  regulation  8  (2)  (b).  The
    refusal was under regulation 12 which requires the respondent to  issue
    a family permit to a family member of an EEA national who  is  residing
    in the UK in accordance with the 2016 EEA Regulations.  The  ECM  noted
    that insufficient evidence had been  supplied  to  show  the  financial
    dependency for the purposes of the regulations, nor  was  he  satisfied
    that the other conditions or regulation 12  were  met.  The  respondent
    also considered  the  application  under  article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) but noted that  the  EEA  Regulations
    fully catered for the private or family life between members of the EEA
    and non-member family members.

The hearing

 3. The appellant claims the decision of the FTT  was  not  one  reasonably
    open to it since dependency had been  established  by  producing  money
    remit remittance slips, call logs, email correspondence (admittedly  in
    French) and details of visits by the sponsor to the Ivory Coast.

 4. I heard submissions by both representatives. Both parties  referred  to
    the case of Moneke [2011] UKUT 00341 and 00341 (IAC).  Mr  TUFFAN  farm
    also relied on the case of the Lim [2011] EWCA CIV 1383. It was pointed
    out at the hearing that the relationship between the appellant and  the
    sponsor were now accepted and there have been DNA evidence  to  support
    this. Miss Clarke pointed out that although there was  a  reference  to
    "parents" on the document page 252 in the appeal bundle used by the FTT
    this had been incorrect as  one  of  the  parents  is  referred  to  as
    "deceased" at page 158. This was the father. It was  pointed  out  that
    the money that the sponsor sent back to Ivory Coast either went to  the
    appellant or the father but since the father was no longer  alive  that
    was obviously impossible. It was  pointed  out  that  the  sponsor  was
    sending approximately ï¿½200 per month  and  this  was  verified  by  the
    document at page 159 - a letter to me  we  may  concern.  She  produced
    substantial evidence to verify the documents  from  Western  Union.  Ms
    Clarke complained the judge had not  considered  adequately  dependency
    within the terms of the regulations and bearing in  mind  the  numerous
    remittances via Western Union (for example at page 69 et seq) there was
    no reason to doubt the dependency here. I was also  referred  to  pages
    108, 112, 117, 163 (a  bank  statement  confirming  a  payment  to  the
    Western Union), 165, 196, 197, 207, 228 - 229 and 231 - 232.

 5. As far as the emails were concerned, this Clarke acknowledged that they
    were in French but said  that  they  verified  the  close  relationship
    between them and the frequent level of communication  between  brothers
    and sister.

 6. The judge was specifically criticised in relation to  his  findings  at
    paragraph 17 of  the  decision,  where  he  referred  to  the  lack  of
    objective evidence to show any great difficulty in obtaining employment
    in the Ivory Coast and the immigration judge was  also  criticised  for
    drawing attention to the sponsor's modest income  as  compared  to  her
    substantial expenditure alleged on the appellant.  I  was  referred  to
    paragraph 32 of the case of Lim where the Court of Appeal  pointed  out
    that it is clear beyond doubt that the fact that the  sponsoring  party
    is able to make substantial  sacrifices  did  not  mean  there  was  no
    dependency the critical question was whether the claimant was  in  fact
    in a position to support himself and the dependent person.

 7. Mr Tuffan, on the other hand, relied on paragraph 5 of the headnote  in
    Moneke where the President contrasted the "membership of  a  household"
    for  the  purposes  of  the  Directive  which  gave  rise  to  the  EEA
    Regulations and "dependency" on the EEA national for  the  purposes  of
    the EEA Regulation. The latter can be  based  on  material  remittances
    sent by the EEA national to the family member, who may live in  another
    country. Mr Tuffan said that the email correspondence was all in French
    and was rightly rejected by the judge. He also referred to page 341 and
    the headnote paragraph 21K. Overall he said that the  decision  of  the
    FTT was sound.

 8. Miss Clarke made  lengthy  submissions  in  reply  later  in  the  day,
    essentially arguing that it was permissible  for  a  dependency  to  be
    based on historical events.

 9. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Discussion

10. The key issue is whether the finding that the appellant had established
    on a balance of probabilities that he was dependent on the sponsor. The
    judge concluded that he was not. Was this conclusion justified  on  the
    evidence?

11. The respondent says that the reasons the judge gave for  rejecting  the
    appellant's evidence were cogent.

12. The appellant says the evidence was sufficient to show a  dependency  -
    the evidence being the form of money remittance  slips,  call  logs,  e
    mail correspondence and visits to the Ivory Coast by the  sponsor.  The
    judge was criticised  for  giving  "jumbled  reasons"  and  it  is  now
    necessary  to  consider  whether,  in  so  far  as  that  criticism  is
    justified, the decision was nevertheless one that was open to him.

13. I find that the decision was open to him for the following reasons:

      i) The judge did not find the sponsor to be  credible  for  the  clear
         reasons given. In particular:

           .  He pointed to a number of inconsistencies in paragraph 16  of
             his decision.  There is no trail to indicate that  remittances
             by the appellant clearly ended up being paid to the  appellant
             as opposed to the appellant's father.

           . He pointed to the lack of a clear reason why the sponsor would
             wish to pay for her adult brother.

           . There was inadequate documentation to support  the  fact  that
             the payments had actually been made.

           . The financial circumstances of the sponsor and her husband did
             not warrant such expenditure. There was no way the Immigration
             Judge thought, such expenditure could have been afforded.

     ii) The issue of what weight to give to one piece of evidence and  what
         to another were matters for the judge having heard the evidence and
         weighed up the documents produced.

    iii) The judge was not  bound  to  attach  any  weight  to  untranslated
         documents and was entitled to reject them.

     iv) The above findings  led  the  judge  to  the  conclusion  that  the
         appellant was not dependent on the sponsor as claimed.

14. There is no dispute that the sponsor is in  the  UK  exercising  treaty
    rights or that she is related as claimed to the appellant, but  on  the
    key finding of lack of dependency, the appeal  failed  for  the  proper
    reasons identified.

Conclusion

15. The decision of the FTT does not contain any material error of law. The
    decision of the FTT therefore stands.

Notice of Decision
