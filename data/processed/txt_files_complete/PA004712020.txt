   1. Both subparagraphs of rule 40(3)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) apply to this decision.
   2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge P B Conrath)  sent  out
      on 13 January 2021 is erroneous in law.  I set it aside.
   3. The appeal is remitted to be determined by the First-tier Tribunal  de
      novo at an oral hearing before a judge other than Judge Conrath.


                               Signed
