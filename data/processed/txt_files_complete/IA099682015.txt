               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N. Garrod, instructed on behalf of the Appellant
For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals, with permission, against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Macdonald) (hereinafter referred to  as  the
    "FtTJ") promulgated on the  3rd  August  2018  in  which  the  Tribunal
    dismissed the appeal of OC against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State made on the 12th March 2015.

 2. I make a direction regarding anonymity under Rule 14  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal Rules) Rules 2008.  Unless and until a  court
    directs otherwise the Appellant is granted anonymity as  the  facts  of
    the appeal also concerns minor children. No report of these proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly affect him or members of his family.  This
    direction applies both to the Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure
    to  comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to  contempt  of  court
    proceedings.

 3. There is a long litigation history to this appeal. I therefore set  out
    the chronology of events to set the appeal in  context.  The  appellant
    claims to have entered the United Kingdom in or about September 2000 as
    an EEA national. He came to the attention  of  the  authorities  on  27
    October 2001 and between December of that year and  September  2011  he
    had six convictions for a number of criminal  offences.  As  a  result,
    deportation action was pursued against him and his appeal against  this
    decision was allowed by  the  FtT  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  17
    February 2011.

 4. On  23  September  2011  the  appellant  was  sentenced  to  60  months
    imprisonment for handling stolen goods. A further deportation order was
    made on 4 May 2012 which resulted in his removal from the UK on the  23
    May 2012. The appellant waived his  rights  of  appeal.  Thereafter  he
    sought admission to enter on 1 February 2014 but was returned to France
    and was then encountered in the UK in June 2014,  arrested  and  served
    with form IS151 A (EEA) and  simultaneously  he  came  to  the  adverse
    attention for criminal offences committed between  September  2011  and
    May  2012  and  was  therefore  sentenced  to  a  further   period   of
    imprisonment in July 2014. In February 2015 further correspondence  was
    sent by  the  appellant  solicitors  setting  out  further  submissions
    relating to his family and private life in  the  United  Kingdom  which
    resulted in the decision under challenge in  this  appeal  made  on  12
    March 2015 (and before other judges, both in the FtT and the UT).

 5. The appellant appealed the refusal of the  human  rights  claim  on  13
    March 2015 and was removed on 16 March 2015. On  28  May  2015  he  was
    encountered at Belfast and was arrested and released on bail.

 6. His appeal was heard in May 2016 before  the  FtT  and  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 24 June 2016  his  appeal  was  allowed.  Permission  to
    appeal that decision was sought by the respondent  and  permission  was
    granted on 11 October 2016. As a result of that grant of permission,  a
    deputy judge of the Upper Tribunal  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    decision of the FtT involved the making of an error of a point  of  law
    and remitted the appeal to the FtT for a further hearing. It  was  then
    heard by the FtT for a second time on  17  July  2018.  In  a  decision
    promulgated on 3 August 2018 the FtT dismissed his  appeal.  Permission
    was sought to appeal that decision and it was  granted  on  10  October
    2018.

 7. It is not necessary to set out the previous decisions in any detail  as
    both parties are in agreement that the decision of the FtTJ involve the
    making of an error on a point of law and that the  decision  should  be
    set aside for the reasons set out below  and  I  therefore  record  the
    agreement reached.

 8. The respondent had filed a  skeleton  argument  shortly  prior  to  the
    hearing in which it was  agreed  that  the  relevant  statutory  appeal
    scheme is the "old, pre-Immigration Act 2014 and that by reason of  the
    transitional provisions (that is the  saving  provisions),  applied  in
    this case and therefore the appellant would  have  had,  by  virtue  of
    receiving a decision to remove taken  under  the  EEA  regulations,  an
    appeal against that decision and schedule 1  of  the  Regulations  read
    with limited interaction with part 5 of the NIAA 2002 (see paragraph  6
    of the skeleton argument).

 9. It is further agreed and accepted by the parties  that  under  the  old
    scheme the appellant could raise other grounds of appeal under  Section
    84, including Section 84 (1) (c) that the decision is not in accordance
    with Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (as set out in paragraph  7
    of the respondent's  skeleton  argument  dated  18/1/19).  It  is  also
    further agreed by both parties that the Upper Tribunal has the power to
    apply the former provision at Section 84 (1) (e) that the decision made
    (that is the decision under appeal of the 12  March  2015)  is  not  in
    accordance with the law for the mistaken application of  Regulation  24
    AA (see paragraphs 5 and 8).

10. In the context of this appeal it is agreed between the  advocates  that
    the decision made on 12 March 2015 is not in accordance  with  the  law
    and therefore they invite the Tribunal to make the decision by  consent
    to set aside the decision of the  FtT  and  to  remake  the  appeal  by
    allowing the  appeal  on  this  ground,  namely  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State made on 12 March 2015 is not in accordance with  the
    law and consequently a lawful decision remains outstanding.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does demonstrate the  making  of  an
error on a point of law.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  shall  be
set aside.

The appeal is remade: the appeal is allowed on the basis that  the  decision
made on the 12th March 2015 was not in  accordance  with  the  law  and  the
decision remains outstanding on the application made by the appellant.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
