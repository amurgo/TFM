Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Balroop, counsel, instructed by M A Consultants
(London)
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. These appeals come before me by  way  of  an  agreed  consent  order
       issued by the Court  of  Appeal  allowing  the  Appellants'  appeals
       against the  decision  of  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Woodcraft
       without consideration of the merits. The terms of the consent order,
       dated 09 February 2016 and supported by a statement of reasons,  set
       aside the Deputy Judge's decision promulgated on 22 June 2015 which,
       in turn, dismissed the appeals brought by the Appellants  against  a
       decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Wooley, promulgated  on
       02 February 2015, who, in turn, dismissed  the  Appellants'  appeals
       against decisions dated 07 September  2014  refusing  to  grant  the
       Appellants  further  leave  to  remain  as  Tier  1   (Entrepreneur)
       Migrants.  The Appellants appeals were remitted back  to  the  Upper
       Tribunal for a full hearing.

Background

    2. The Appellants are brothers  of  Pakistani  nationality.  They  were
       granted leave to enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  Tier  4  (General)
       Students and their leave was subsequently extended following in-time
       applications.  On  21  July  2014  both  Appellants   made   in-time
       applications for further leave to remain as team members  under  the
       Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  category.  Their  applications  were
       based on the establishment of R.HF Consultants  Limited,  a  company
       offering professional marketing and business development services.


    3. These applications were refused by the Respondent on the basis that

       i) the Appellants failed to demonstrate access to �50,000 on any one
          day;


      ii) that they did  not  own  the  domain  name  of  their  business's
          website; and

     iii) that they did not provide any documentation from HMRC to  confirm
          their business was registered for corporation tax.

Decision of the First-tier Judge

    4. The Appellants appealed the Respondent's decision and  their  appeal
       was heard by the First-tier Tribunal on 23 January 2015. The  First-
       tier Tribunal judge dismissed the appeal upholding the  Respondent's
       decision in respect of all points from (i) to (iii).

Decision of the Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge

    5.  Aggrieved  with  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   the
       Appellants sought, and were granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the
       Upper Tribunal. In a decision promulgated on 22 June 2015 the Deputy
       Judge accepted that the First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  apply  the
       immigration rules in existence  at  the  date  of  the  Respondent's
       decision and applied instead the rules as they were at the  date  of
       the appeal hearing. This made a material difference  in  respect  of
       (i)  above.  The  Deputy  Judge  found  that  the   Appellants   did
       demonstrate that they had access to �50,000 in accordance  with  the
       immigration rules as they were at the  date  of  the  decision.  The
       Respondent has not challenged this  aspect  of  the  Deputy  Judge's
       conclusion.


    6. The Deputy Judge found that the requirement to demonstrate ownership
       of the domain name  of  the  Appellants'  business  website  was  an
       alternative and, as the company was not trading online,  the  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge fell into legal error in requiring  evidence  of
       such ownership. The Deputy Judge was not however satisfied that  the
       Appellants provided marketing or  advertising  material  covering  a
       continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014 up  to  no  earlier
       than 3 months before the date of their application, as  required  by
       paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii)  of  Appendix  A.  This  issue  remains  the
       central area of dispute in the appeals before me.

    7. With respect to (iii) the Deputy  Judge  found  that,  although  the
       Appellants had not provided evidence to show that their company  was
       registered for corporation tax, this was not a  requirement  in  the
       immigration rules as they were  at  the  date  of  the  Respondent's
       decisions. Ms Isherwood indicated  at  the  outset  of  the  hearing
       before me that this issue remained live.

    8. Given that the Deputy Judge was not satisfied  that  the  Appellants
       met the requirements of paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)  he  dismissed  the
       appeals. However, in so doing  the  Deputy  Judge  had  not  invited
       submissions from the Appellants representative  in  respect  of  the
       merits of the case. In the Statement  of  Reasons  accompanying  the
       Consent Order the Respondent agreed that the failure  to  allow  the
       Appellants any opportunity to make submissions deprived them of  the
       right to a fair hearing and amounted to a breach of natural justice.



Submissions from the parties

    9.  At the outset of the  rehearing  I  sought  confirmation  from  the
       parties as to the focus of the appeal. Mr Isherwood did not seek  to
       challenge the conclusion of the Deputy Judge that the Appellants did
       have access to �50,000. She did however submit that  the  Appellants
       failed to provide  the  required  Companies  House  documents  under
       paragraph 41-SD(b), a point  not  previously  raised.  Ms  Isherwood
       indicated however that the principle focus of her submissions  would
       be with respect to the requirements of paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii).


   10. Mr Balroop made brief submissions in respect of the Companies  House
       documents and then focused his attention on paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii).
       He referred me to flyers at pages  19  and  20  of  the  Appellants'
       bundle that  were  provided  to  the  Respondent  with  the  Tier  1
       application. He accepted  that  the  Appellants'  business  was  not
       trading online. He submitted that the provision of  the  advertising
       flyers  with  the  applications  was  sufficient  to   satisfy   the
       advertising and marketing requirements in  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii).
       Mr Balroop confirmed that there was no evidence  before  the  First-
       tier Tribunal, or  indeed  the  Respondent,  that  the  flyers  were
       'published locally or nationally'. He submitted that, if the  flyers
       were accepted as advertising material, then a holistic approach must
       be adopted and the leaflets must be viewed as having been published.



   11. Mr Balroop submitted, in the alternative, that  the  Respondent  was
       obliged to exercise her discretion  under  paragraph  245AA  of  the
       immigration rules if not satisfied that the flyers contained all the
       'specified information'.  Further  to  this  submission  Mr  Balroop
       submitted that, had a request been made under  paragraph  245AA,  an
       invoice dated 08 July 2014 from ISB Design & Print would  have  been
       provided confirming  the  printing  of  the  flyers.  This,  it  was
       submitted, would have demonstrated compliance with  the  requirement
       that the advertising material covered a continuous period commencing
       before 11 July 2014. Mr  Balroop  submitted  that  the  invoice,  in
       conjunction with the flyers, made  it  clear  that  there  had  been
       advertising material published  in  accordance  with  paragraph  41-
       SD(e)(iii).

   12. Ms Isherwood submitted that the Appellants failed  to  provide  with
       their applications evidence of actual advertising. There was said to
       be no obligation  on  the  Respondent  to  exercise  her  discretion
       pursuant to paragraph 245AA as the  applications  were  refused  for
       other reasons as well. In any event, paragraph  245AA  required  the
       missing 'specified information' to be contained within the specified
       document itself and not an external document such as an invoice.

Discussion

   13. It was agreed by the parties that the principle issue in this appeal
       was whether the Appellants met the requirements of paragraph 41-
       SD(e)(iii)(1) of Appendix A to the immigration rules. This paragraph
       reads, in material part and at the date of the Respondent's
       decisions (07 September 2014):


       (e) If the applicant is applying under the provisions in (d) in Table
       4, he must also provide:

          (iii) one or more of the following specified documents covering
          (either together or individually) a continuous period commencing
          before 11 July 2014 up to no earlier than three months before the
          date of his application:


          1) advertising or marketing material, including printouts of
             online advertising, that has been published locally or
             nationally, showing the applicant's name (and the name of the
             business if applicable) together with the business activity or,
             where his business is trading online, confirmation of his
             ownership of the domain name of the business's website


   14. There was no dispute that the Appellants were applying under the
       provisions of (d) in Table 4 contained in Appendix A. As such, the
       specified documents provided by the Appellants had to cover a
       continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014. Furthermore, the
       advertising or marketing material had to have been 'published
       locally or nationally'.


   15. At pages 19 and 20 the Appellants produced a flyer that they
       maintained was provided to the Respondent with their Tier 1
       application. Ms Isherwood did not dispute this assertion. The flyer
       (or leaflet) described the Appellants' company and gave both their
       names and contact details. No reference was made to any website. As
       confirmed by Mr Balroop the Tier 1 application did not contain any
       other evidence of marketing or advertising.

   16. Mr Balroop submitted that the provision of the flyers was in itself
       sufficient to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii)(1)
       both in respect of the publication requirement and the period that
       the specified documents had to cover. I reject this submission. I am
       entirely satisfied that the term 'published locally or nationally'
       requires the advertising or marketing material to have actually been
       distributed or communicated to the public. There is a clear
       distinction between a document being 'printed' and 'published'.  I
       take the term 'published', in the context in which it is used in
       paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii), to mean that the advertising or marketing
       material must have been made available to the public. While flyers
       may have been printed with their 'publication' in mind, it is not
       necessarily the case that they would have been disseminated to the
       public.

   17.  The immigration rules require specified evidence that the
       advertising or marketing undertaken by an applicant has been
       genuine. It is clear that the rules have in mind marketing such as
       advertisements that have been inserted in newspapers or magazines
       which could then be produced with an application, or online
       advertising which can be printed showing the relevant date and
       details. The method of marketing is however left open and an
       applicant is fully entitled to show that their business has been
       marketed in another way provided that the marketing or advertising
       material has been 'published locally or nationally'.  If an
       individual chooses to advertise by publishing leaflets 'locally or
       nationally' he or she must provide satisfactory evidence with her
       application that the leaflets have actually been disseminated in
       some manner to the public. This could, for example, be by way of
       statements from individuals who distributed the leaflets on a
       particular day and location, or a series of photographs showing the
       distribution which contain the date and time when they were taken.

   18. No such evidence was provided with the Tier 1 applications. The
       existence of the flyers, by reference to the single example given in
       the Appellants' bundle, demonstrates that the flyers were printed.
       For the reasons given above I am not satisfied that they demonstrate
       publication locally or nationally.

   19. Mr Balroop submitted, in the alternative, that the Respondent should
       have exercised her discretion under paragraph 245AA of the
       immigration rules and requested from the Appellants further evidence
       of advertising.

   20. paragraph 245AA read, at the date of the decisions and in material
       part:

       245AA. Documents not submitted with applications

       (a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part 6A state
       that specified documents must be provided, the Entry Clearance
       Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State will only
       consider documents that have been submitted with the application,
       and will only consider documents submitted after the application
       where they are submitted in accordance with subparagraph (b).

       (b) If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:

           (i) Some of the documents in a sequence have been omitted (for
           example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);

           (ii) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if a letter
           is not on letterhead paper as specified); or

           (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or

           (iv) A document does not contain all of the specified
      information;


           the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the
           Secretary of State may contact the applicant or his
           representative in writing, and request the correct documents.
           The requested documents must be received at the address
           specified in the request within 7 working days of the date of
           the request.

      (c) Documents will not be requested where a specified document has not
      been submitted (for example an English language certificate is
      missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or
      the Secretary of State does not anticipate that addressing the
      omission or error referred to in subparagraph (b) will lead to a grant
      because the application will be refused for other reasons.

   21. Mr Balroop submitted that the flyers provided by the Appellants with
       their applications did not contain 'all of the specified
       information' and that the Respondent should have considered
       exercising her discretion. Paragraph 245AA(b)(iv) relates to a
       'document' that does not contain all the specified information. This
       suggests that the assessment as to whether the specified document
       contains all the specified information is an internal examination,
       i.e. one that is limited to the document itself. It is apparent from
       the terms of paragraph 245AA(b) that the exercise of discretion must
       result in a request for the 'correct documents'. It is therefore
       difficult to see how the provision of an entirely different type of
       document could correct an error in a specified document that does
       not contain all of the specified information. With respect to the
       instant appeals, it is difficult to imagine how any correction to
       the flyers themselves could remedy the defects relating to the need
       to demonstrate publication locally or nationally, or indeed the need
       for the specified documents to cover a continuous period commencing
       before 11 July 2014.


   22. Even were I to accept Mr Balroop's submission, and take into account
       the evidence provided after the application, I am not satisfied that
       the invoice date 08 July 2014 was capable of demonstrating that the
       leaflets were published locally or nationally. At the most the
       invoice shows that the leaflets were printed on 08 July 2014. For
       the reasons I have already given I find there is a distinction
       between a date on which a flyer was printed and the date on which it
       was published. I am therefore not satisfied that the leaflets were
       published locally or nationally. In these circumstances I find the
       Appellants could not have met the requirements of the immigration
       rules.

   23. For completeness I am satisfied that the Deputy Judge was correct in
       his assessment of the need to provide evidence of the company's
       registration for corporation tax.

          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law.


    I remake the decision and dismiss both appeals  under  the  immigration
    rules.
