                                DETERMINATION

 1. I refer to my decision and  directions  arising  out  of  the  previous
    listing of this appeal on 15 July 2014.  Once again, the Appellant  has
    failed to attend  to  prosecute  his  appeal  and  there  has  been  no
    communication from him.

 2. In the circumstances, I dismiss the appeal.

 3. Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is affirmed.

                                                                       [pic]
