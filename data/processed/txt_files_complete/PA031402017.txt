                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D McGlashan, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the UT against a decision by FtT  Judge  Mill,
    promulgated on 11 May 2017.  His grounds are stated in  the  attachment
    to his application for permission to appeal, dated 29 September 2017.

 2. The grounds at 2.1 say that the judge left out of account risk  at  the
    point of return and in onward travel.  On  this  point,  the  appellant
    seeks to have it both  ways,  saying  both  that  AT  [2014]  had  been
    superseded, and  that  there  is  an  additional  risk  factor  to  the
    appellant as identified in AT.  More significantly, the ground fails to
    go beyond vague disagreement.   It  specifies  no  evidence  which  was
    brought to the judge's attention by which he  might  have  decided  the
    case in the appellant's favour, based on this issue.

 3. The grounds at 2.2 are only a quibble  about  the  significance  to  be
    given to the timing of the protection claim.

 4. The point at 2.3  is  difficult  to  decipher,  and  not  shown  to  be
    material.

 5. The grounds at 2.4 says that each case has to be  decided  on  its  own
    facts, which is what the  judge  did,  and  that  the  judge  "has  not
    properly taken into account the significance of the appellant's  race",
    which is only a vague disagreement.

 6. Mr McGlashan submitted that the judge should have  allowed  the  appeal
    based on general risk, but he showed no error of  law  in  the  judge's
    conclusion at ï¿½37 to the contrary, based on the evidence before him.

 7. These proceedings have in all  probability  become  academic.   On  the
    authority of ZMM Libya CG [2017] UKUT 00263 the appellant is likely  on
    further  application  to  the  respondent  to  be  found  entitled   to
    protection, simply as a returning  civilian.   However,  the  appellant
    does not show that on the case law as it then stood and on the evidence
    and pleadings before him, the making of the  decision  by  Judge  Mills
    involved the making of any error on a point of law, such that it  ought
    to be set aside.

 8. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
