For the Appellant:     Mrs Chawdhery, Counsel instructed by Mellor &
                       Jackson Sols
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant  is  a  national  of  Pakistan,  born  in  1982.  He  has
    permission[1] to appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    (Judge Wedderspoon)  to  dismiss  his  appeal  with  reference  to  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ('the Regs').


 2. Mr Raza sought  a  residence  card  confirming  a  permanent  right  of
    residence under Regulation 15(1)(b) of the Regs.  The  only  matter  in
    issue before the First-tier Tribunal was whether he could establish  an
    entitlement to such a card by showing that his EEA  national  wife,  Ms
    Melinda Tarr, had been exercising treaty rights for a continuous period
    of five years.  The Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  had
    found there to be insufficient evidence that she had been  economically
    active throughout that period and so had refused to issue the card.

 3. The refusal letter was dated the  19th  October  2015.   The  Appellant
    exercised his right of appeal and on the 5th May  2016  the  First-tier
    Tribunal issued directions which inter alia stated:

         "The Appellant must send copies of all documents  to  the  Tribunal
         and to the other party a bundle of all documents you wish  to  rely
         on in support of the appeal...."

 4. On the 23rd May 2016 the parties were notified that the hearing was  to
    take place on the 19th July 2016.

 5. On the 19th July 2016 the Appellant and his wife  attended  the  First-
    tier Tribunal accompanied by their legal representative.  At  paragraph
    22 the determination reads as follows:

         "Towards the end of the submissions the Appellant  stated  that  he
         had further documents he wished the  Tribunal  to  consider.  These
         documents labelled exhibit A1 had not been disclosed  to  the  Home
         Office before now. Miss Johnstone [the  HOPO]  was  given  time  to
         consider these but submitted that they were introduced too late  in
         the day and she had not had the opportunity to check them out...."


    The determination continues, at paragraph 25:


         "I considered the directions in this case given on  5th  May  2016.
         This directed the Appellant to send copies of all documents  relied
         upon to the Tribunal  and  the  other  party.  This  had  not  been
         complied with. Further I had not heard any direct witness  evidence
         from the Appellant's spouse about this material. The Respondent had
         no time to check the documents now relied upon. Taking into account
         the overriding objective and balance of prejudice to the parties, I
         decided not to  consider  this  evidence  on  the  basis  that  the
         documents were available since the beginning  of  June  2016;  they
         were disclosed very late; there was no adequate explanation  as  to
         why the solicitor had not included the documents in  the  disclosed
         bundle; the respondent had inadequate time to check  its  veracity;
         no evidence had been called to  corroborate  it.   I  consider  the
         prejudice to the Respondent outweighed that of  the  Appellant  who
         could make a further application on the basis of this  material  if
         this appeal was unsuccessful".

 6. The  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appeal,  agreeing  with  the
    Secretary of State that there was insufficient evidence  that  Ms  Tarr
    had been economically active.

 7.  The  Appellant's  representatives  have  now  sought,  and   obtained,
    permission to appeal on his behalf on the grounds that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal acted unfairly  in  refusing  to  look  at  the  documents  in
    question. It is submitted that the documents  at  A1,  comprising  HMRC
    records  covering  the  whole  five-year  period,   would   have   been
    determinative of the appeal, and it was plainly unjust to exclude them.

 8. Mr Harrison for the Secretary  of  State  does  not  dispute  that  the
    documents were  capable  of  being  determinative  in  the  appeal.  He
    nevertheless resists the appeal before me. He submits that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal gave very good reasons for not  admitting  this  evidence
    and that there was no material error of law arising from its refusal to
    do so.



    My Findings

 9. I am bound to observe  that  I  find  it  to  be  surprising  that  the
    Appellant has pursued this appeal. He is the family member  of  an  EEA
    national who presently has a recognised right to reside in this country
    under Reg 7. He can make an application at any  time  under  Regulation
    15, and pay a minimal fee for doing so (Mr Harrison thought the fee  to
    be something in the region of ï¿½65).  I have been presented with  a  446
    page bundle of evidence all going to his wife's economic activity. This
    includes the material that the First-tier Tribunal refused to look  at.
    It seems to me that the more straightforward - and considerably cheaper
    - course of  action  would  have  been  for  Mr  Raza  to  make  a  new
    application, this time supported by this very great volume of evidence.




10. Turning to the merits of the appeal, the only ground pursued before  me
    was whether or not the First-tier Tribunal acted  irrationally/unfairly
    in refusing to admit the bundle marked 'exhibit A1'.

11. I find there to be no error of law in the approach taken.

12. First of all, it is clear from  the  chronology  that  the  Appellant's
    representatives knew the case against him since as long ago as  October
    2015.    Directions were given in  May  2016.  The  parties  had  eight
    weeks' notice in  advance  of  the  appeal.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination states that "no adequate explanation" was given for their
    very late appearance; as far as I can see no reason  at  all  has  been
    advanced. It is clear from the face of the documents themselves that Ms
    Tarr did not seek to obtain her tax records until the  8th  June  2016.
    The letter, and enclosures, that comprise exhibit A1 were sent  out  by
    HMRC that day.    They  could  therefore  have  been  supplied  to  the
    Respondent, and Tribunal, in compliance with  directions  and  in  good
    time for the hearing.    Not only were those  directions  ignored,  the
    Appellant's representative then apparently attempted to  introduce  the
    bundle during the course of submissions, when the evidence had  already
    been closed and the Home Office Presenting Officer had already made her
    case.  In these circumstances it can hardly be said that the  Appellant
    was prejudiced by the Tribunal's failings.

13. Secondly, the First-tier Tribunal has given a number of perfectly  good
    reasons why it took the decision that it did. Those  reasons,  set  out
    above, do not disclose any material error of law.

14. The appeal is therefore dismissed.


      Decisions


15. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error  of  law
    and it is upheld.


16. There is no order for anonymity.
