For the Respondent:    Miss S Rushforth, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The decision under challenge in this case is that of Judges Murray  and
    Dorrington  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  sent  on  1  October.   They
    considered the appeal of the appellant, a national of Iraq, against the
    decision made by the respondent on 10 July 2018 to refuse  his  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights  claim.   They  dismissed  his
    appeal on asylum and humanitarian protection  grounds  but  allowed  it
    under Article 3 ECHR.  Their  decision  comes  under  attack  from  two
    directions: the appellant challenges their refusal to allow the  appeal
    on humanitarian protection grounds; the respondent  taking  issue  with
    the judges' decision to allow it on  Article  3  grounds.   The  judges
    refused the  appellant's  appeal  on  humanitarian  protection  grounds
    because they considered he fell to be  excluded  as  a  result  of  his
    commission of a serious  crime,  namely  burglary,  for  which  he  was
    sentenced in October 2009 to  two  years  eight  months'  imprisonment.
    They allowed his Article 3 claim because they considered he  would  not
    be able to obtain a CSID.

2.   It is important to note that one of the issues before  the  judges  was
    whether the respondent was entitled to certify the  appellant's  asylum
    claim under s72 of the NIAA 2002.  The judges first of all  found  that
    "the presumption contained in s72(2) that the crime is  a  particularly
    serious one is made out".  They stated at paragraph 35 that:

         "35. The  presumption  that  the  Appellant  is  a  danger  to  the
             community is  rebuttable  by  the  Appellant  (s72  (6)).   We
             consider, firstly that the presumption contained  in  s72  (2)
             that the crime is a particularly serious one is made out.  The
             sentencing remarks  of  the  Judge  are  in  the  Respondent's
             bundle.  The Appellant committed  a  burglary  in  a  dwelling
             house and assaulted the householder who suffered some physical
             injuries namely cuts and bruises.  His wife  was  also  there.
             The judge noted that the Appellant had only  one  caution  and
             was a young  man  of  good  character  and  the  burglary  was
             opportunistic rather than planned.   Because  force  was  used
             against householders who  were  present  during  a  night-time
             burglary these were aggravating features.  Further, he  was  a
             young man according to the pre-sentence report who appeared to
             have little insight into the  seriousness  of  the  situation.
             Consequently,  he  was  sentenced  to  4  years  in  a   young
             offender's institution reduced on his plea  of  guilty  to  32
             months".

3.   In  the  first  sentence  of  paragraph  36  they  added  that:  "[t]he
    seriousness of the offence is reflected in the length of  sentence  and
    the  sentencing  remarks  of  the  judge".   Secondly,  however,   they
    considered that the s72  certificate  was  not  made  out  because  the
    appellant had rebutted the s72(6) presumption that he is  a  danger  to
    the community.  At paragraphs 39-40 they concluded:

         "39. The Respondent relies on section  72  in  the  refusal  letter
             dated January 2018 which is the subject of the current appeal.
              The Respondent also relies on the two previous determinations
             of the First-tier and Upper Tier Tribunal.  It is  clear  from
             the Upper Tribunal decision that the Upper Tribunal found that
             the  First-tier  Tribunal's  approach  to   section   72   was
             procedurally flawed but concluded that in  view  of  the  fact
             that this was not material when looking at the decision  as  a
             whole the decision of the First-tier Tribunal could stand.  It
             is now some nine years since the  Appellant's  conviction  and
             some  5ï¿½  years  since  he  was  released   from   immigration
             detention.


         40.  In that  time  there  has  been  no  suggestion  that  he  has
             committed a further offence or indeed that his  behaviour  has
             in any way constituted a danger to the community.   There  has
             been no repetition of his behaviour and there  is  no  current
             evidence which would tend to show that he posed a risk to  the
             community.  We consider that the effluxion  of  time  and  the
             absence of any repetition of the offending behaviour show that
             the Appellant does not demonstrate a real and  present  danger
             to the community.  It  follows  that  we  do  not  uphold  the
             section 72 certificate".

     Neither of these findings are disputed by the parties.

The Appellant's Grounds of Appeal

4.   The thrust of the appellant's grounds of appeal are  that  the  judges'
    treatment of the exclusion issue was married by  two  errors:  firstly,
    that they failed to apply the correct threshold (or standard of  proof)
    set out in paragraph 339D(i), namely "serious reasons for considering";
    and secondly, that they had deviated from higher court  guidance  which
    required the court  to  carry  out  a  close  examination  of  all  the
    circumstances  surrounding  an  appellant's  offending,  including   an
    assessment of the individual's responsibility (they cited in support AH
    (Algeria) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 395).  The focus of both limbs of this
    ground is what the judges said at paragraph 54:

         "54. It is not in  dispute  that  the  Appellant  has  committed  a
             serious crime having been sentenced for an offence to over  12
             months.  In LP (St Lucia) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
             Department [2010] EWCA  Civ  493,  the  Court  confirmed  that
             paragraph 339 D was not subject to the rebuttal provisions  in
             the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  in  the
             humanitarian protection  context  as  it  was  in  the  asylum
             context.   The  rule  in   paragraph   339D(i)   was   without
             qualification.  We conclude therefore that  the  Appellant  is
             excluded from humanitarian protection".

    I am not persuaded by either limb of the appellant's grounds.


5.   Dealing with the second limb first, it is clear that in  deciding  that
    the appellant had committed a serious crime the judges had carried  out
    a  close  examination  of  all  the   circumstances   surrounding   the
    appellant's  offending  including  an  assessment   of   his   personal
    responsibility.  They had done that at paragraph  35  when  considering
    whether the presumption that the appellant had committed a particularly
    serious crime was made out.  Their examination in that paragraph of the
    issue of whether there  was  a  "particularly  serious  crime"  clearly
    applied a fortiori to whether the same crime was "serious".

6.   Turning to the first limb, I would accept that  the  judges'  treatment
    of the issue in paragraph 54 fails to identify that  the  question  for
    them was not whether there was a serious crime but whether  there  were
    serious reasons for considering a serious  crime  had  been  committed.
    However, in the preceding paragraph they had set out the full  text  of
    paragraph 339D. Given their emphatic finding  that  the  appellant  had
    committed a serious crime, their  reasoning  can  safely  be  taken  to
    incorporate a finding that for so  considering  the  crime  as  serious
    there were serious  reasons.   Further,  as  I  observed  earlier,  the
    appellant's grounds do not challenge the judges'  conclusion  that  the
    appellant had committed a particularly  serious  crime  and  the  legal
    effect of that finding was that they were satisfied there were  serious
    reasons for considering the  appellant  had  committed  a  particularly
    serious crime. A particularly serious crime is a serious crime.  I  see
    no error in the judges' invocation of LP (St Lucia) [2010] EWCA Civ 493
    at paragraph 26, since Laws LJ clearly thought that where there was  no
    doubt that there had been commission  of  a  serious  crime,  paragraph
    339D(iv) was made out.  Just like the judges  in  this  case,  Laws  LJ
    clearly considered this threshold was plainly met where the  commission
    of a serious crime was not in doubt.

The Respondent's Grounds Challenging the Judges' Allowance of the Appeal  on
Article 3 Grounds

7.   The gravamen of the  respondent's  grounds  was  that  the  judges  had
    failed to give clear reasons (particularly bearing in mind his lack  of
    credibility) as to why the appellant would be unable to  locate  family
    and friends in Iraq who could then  assist  him  obtain  a  replacement
    CSID.  The grounds maintain that the judges should have recognised that
    the appellant had failed to show he had exhausted all possibilities  of
    obtaining a replacement document.

8.   I would  add  that  the  appellant's  grounds  appeared  to  argue  (at
    paragraph 12) that the fact that the appellant had been  found  not  to
    any longer be a danger to the community (although he had been so  found
    by a Tribunal in October 2012) should have been seen by the  judges  as
    relevant to the  issue  of  whether  there  were  serious  reasons  for
    considering that he had committed a serious crime.  With respect,  that
    contention is misconceived.  The test set out in paragraph 339D(iv)  is
    an historic one and post-commission behaviour is irrelevant to  whether
    when committed it was serious.

9.   In my judgment these grounds in their other aspects amount  to  a  mere
    disagreement with the judges'  findings  on  this  issue.   The  judges
    carefully directed themselves as to  the  contents  of  the  applicable
    country guidance AAH (Iraqi Kurds - internal relocation) Iraq  CG  UKUT
    00212, with reference to the Court of  Appeal  decision  in  AA  (Iraq)
    [2017] EWCA Civ 944 (which modified the country guidance  given  in  AA
    (Article 15c) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 544 (IAC). .  They noted at paragraph
    62 that there had been a finding in the previous Tribunal decision that
    he had at least one relative, his maternal  uncle,  in  his  home  area
    (Kirkuk).  At paragraph  63  they  found  that  the  appellant  had  no
    passport or CSID.  There was no evidence he had family in Erbil.   Then
    at paragraph 64 they stated:

         "64. Notwithstanding the previous adverse credibility  findings  in
             relation to the core of the Appellant's account which we  have
             adopted,  no  previous  findings  have  been  made  that   the
             Appellant remains in touch with his family in Iraq and he  has
             remained consistent in respect of this part  of  his  account.
             He was only 15 when he arrived in the UK and has now been here
             for 13 years.  Further, we find that it is not seen within the
             context of events in Kirkuk,  implausible  that  he  has  lost
             contact  since  2008.   The  recent   history  of  Kirkuk  was
             summarized in AAH and, even if there are now cogent reasons to
             depart from the country guidance in AA that it is a  contested
             area for the purposes of Article  15  (c)  (which  we  do  not
             determine at this point), it has until  recently  been  such".



10.  They concluded at paragraph 65 that:

         "65. Given the Appellant has been consistent in his account to have
             lost all contact with his relatives and  the  plausibility  of
             this given the internal displacement and the fact that it  has
             been a contested area, we accept that he has no  contact  with
             family members".

    They went on to find at paragraph  66  that  he  had  no  relatives  or
         friends in Baghdad:

         "66. The Appellant would be returned to Baghdad and is expected  to
             find his way to Kirkuk/the IKR by himself.  We accept, and the
             contrary has not been suggested, that  the  Appellant  has  no
             relatives or friends in Baghdad.  We have therefore considered
             whether he would be able to  obtain  a  CSID  because  in  the
             absence of such a document he is likely  to  face  significant
             difficulties in accessing housing, employment, healthcare  and
             other services which are likely  to  amount  to  a  breach  of
             Article 3.  In coming to our conclusions, we have  had  regard
             to the findings of the Upper Tribunal at paragraphs 100 to 107
             of AAH.  On the basis of our factual  findings  regarding  the
             absence of any friends or relatives in Iraq, we find that  the
             Appellant does not have the required documentation to obtain a
             CSID through the consular section  of  the  Iraqi  Embassy  in
             London nor is he able to obtain a power of  attorney  allowing
             someone in Iraq to obtain  the  CSID  from  the  Civil  Status
             Affairs Office in his own governorate".

    At paragraph 67 they concluded:

         "67. Taking the factors in AAH into account, the Appellant  has  no
             documentation which would be  of  assistance  in  tracing  his
             family records; no male family member who would be willing  to
             attend the civil registry (which in  any  event  would  be  in
             Kirkuk) and it is unclear whether the civil registry office in
             Kirkuk is operational as it is an area formerly held by ISIL".

11.  Having further analysed  at  paragraphs  70-73  whether  the  appellant
    could obtain a CSID in Baghdad or the IKR, the  Tribunal  concluded  at
    paragraph 74:

         "74. In view of those conclusions, and the Respondent's  concession
             set out above that a person who is unable replace  their  CSID
             and obtain support from family members or others is likely  to
             face  significant  difficulties  in  accessing  services   and
             humanitarian  conditions  which  are  likely  to   result   in
             destitution sufficient to amount to a breach of Article  3  of
             the ECHR, we find that the Appellant is likely to be  at  risk
             of treatment amounting to a breach of Article 3 if he  remains
             in Baghdad or tries to return to Kirkuk via  land.   In  those
             circumstances, we do not need to determine if Kirkuk remains a
             contested area or whether the  Appellant's  deportation  would
             breach his rights under Article 8 ECHR".

12.  Several observations are in order regarding the  judges'  treatment  of
    the CSID issue.  It was extremely methodical and detailed.  It  closely
    adhered to Tribunal and Court of Appeal guidance on  this  very  issue.
    When considering the factual issue of whether the appellant had  family
    or friends in Iraq, the judges took fully into account that he had been
    found to lack credibility in other material respects.   They  supported
    their finding with background  country  information  regarding  Kirkuk.
    Palpably there was no failure to give clear reasons.

13.  It is true that the judge did not specifically  address  the  issue  of
    whether the appellant had "exhausted all possibilities" of obtaining  a
    replacement document.  But  (leaving  aside  that  "exhaustion  of  all
    possibilities" constitutes far too high a standard  of  proof)  on  the
    basis of the country guidance, someone in the position of the appellant
    could not obtain a CSID by approaching the Iraqi Consulate  in  London.
    Paragraph 117 of AA refers to the fact that appellants can  give  power
    of attorney to friends/relatives in Iraq, but  that  presupposes  there
    are such identifiable persons.  The country guidance does  not  contain
    any qualifications making its application dependent on  the  making  of
    attempts via the Red Cross or Red Crescent to try and locate family.  I
    do not consider that the judges' treatment of this issue fell into  any
    legal error.

14.  For the above reasons, I conclude:

    The  appellant's  grounds  assailing  the  judges'  exclusion  of   the
    appellant from humanitarian protection are rejected.


    The respondent's grounds taking issue with the judges' allowance of the
    appellant's appeal on Article 3 grounds are also rejected.


    Accordingly, the decision of the FtT shall stand.


15.  An anonymity direction is made.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
