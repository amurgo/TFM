For the Appellant:     Miss F Robertson, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Albania born on 12th September 1998.  The
    Appellant applied on 16th  August  2016  for  asylum  and  humanitarian
    protection and to be recognised as  a  refugee  on  the  basis  of  her
    membership of a particular group, namely an Albanian woman who had been
    trafficked.  That application was refused by Notice  of  Refusal  dated
    20th September 2018.  Grounds of Appeal were lodged and the appeal came
    before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ross sitting at Taylor House on
    10th December 2018.  In a Decision  and  Reasons  promulgated  on  22nd
    February 2019 the Appellant's appeal was dismissed.

 2. On 6th March 2019 Grounds of Appeal were lodged at the Upper  Tribunal.
    On 29th March 2019 First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Grant-Hutchison  granted
    permission to appeal.  Judge Grant-Hutchison noted that it was arguable
    that the judge had erred in law by:-

      a) failing to consider the second limb of  the  Appellant's  claim  in
         that even if she was found not to be a  victim  of  trafficking  on
         return she would be considered  "kurva"  (a  whore)  as  being  the
         unmarried mother of a child; and

      b)  that  the  judge  had  failed  to  take  into   account   material
         considerations with regard to the Appellant's  movements  when  she
         travelled out of Albania.

 3. It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The Appellant  appears  by  her  instructed
    Counsel Miss Robertson.  The Secretary of State  appears  by  his  Home
    Office Presenting Officer, Mr Tarlow.

Submissions/Discussion

 4. In giving my judgment in this matter it  is  appropriate  in  order  to
    shorten the judgment but to still give a  full  analysis  of  what  has
    taken place to turn to the concession that is made by  Mr  Tarlow.   Mr
    Tarlow concedes that there are material errors of law in  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge which could have substantial influence
    on the findings in this matter, and in particular on the assessment  of
    the Appellant's credibility.  That concession is made at the conclusion
    of the submissions made by Miss Robertson.

 5. I have had  the  benefit  of  hearing  well  put  submissions  by  Miss
    Robertson and by the reference that she has made therein to the Grounds
    of Appeal.  She  has  pointed  out  that  the  judge  appears  to  have
    fundamentally misunderstood the second limb of  the  Appellant's  case,
    namely that if she was to be found to be a  victim  of  trafficking  on
    return she  would  be  considered  "kurva",  being  perceived  to  have
    dishonoured her family and herself and would thus be at risk  from  her
    family or traffickers.  The judge appears  to  have  misunderstood,  or
    ignored, the fact that the Appellant would be at risk solely due to the
    fact that she would be returning to Albania alone with an  illegitimate
    child, a fact that is not in dispute.  The failure to make a finding on
    this issue is in itself a material error of law.

 6. Further, the judge has, it is submitted by Miss Robertson, assessed the
    Appellant's credibility with flaws which  taint  the  judgment  in  its
    entirety.  She sets out four bases:-

      i) That the judge has found that the Appellant's account  of  how  the
         Appellant went to Paris lacks  credibility  and  the  judge's  sole
         reason appears to be, "from the answers which the Appellant gave in
         her asylum interview, it is clear that she had planned  in  advance
         to go to Italy with V on the pretence  of  joining  her  fianc�  in
         Paris."

         The  judge  has  presented  this,  she  submits,  as  if  it   were
         inconsistent with the Appellant's case, but in fact  this  was  the
         Appellant's case, and that the judge has failed both to engage with
         the background evidence and  to  explain  why  he  constructs  this
         aspect of the Appellant's claim as adverse to her credibility.

     ii) Secondly, the judge found that the Appellant's evidence  about  her
         fianc� was vague and confusing.  Miss Robertson  submits  that  the
         Appellant was not asked about her introduction to her fianc� in her
         asylum interview nor was she cross-examined on  the  issue  by  the
         Home Office Presenting Officer; nor did the judge ask any questions
         in this regard.  The judge in fact, she submits, made an  error  of
         fact in that the  Appellant's  asylum  interview  was  not  only  a
         clarification given by the Appellant, but the failure  to  consider
         this shows that the judge's findings were unsound.

    iii) Thirdly, she takes me to the Appellant's account  of  her  time  in
         Italy and the judge's submission that her account therein is  vague
         and lacks credibility.  She  submits  that  this  in  itself  is  a
         material error of law because the judge had  failed  to  take  into
         account additional evidence given by the Appellant, the context  in
         which she gave that information and the fact that the extent of the
         information provided by  the  Appellant  was  consistent  with  the
         knowledge  that  one  might  expect  a  trafficked  person  in  the
         situation she describes, i.e. effectively under  house  arrest  and
         confined in a guarded room.  Further, she submits the judge appears
         to have overlooked the fact that the Appellant moved from Padova to
         Savona at the end of March 2016.  She points out that the Appellant
         had in fact given specific details as to where she was staying  and
         also, so  far  as  her  geographical  surroundings  are  concerned,
         bearing in mind the house arrest to which she was subjected, it  is
         unreasonable to expect her to have gained any material knowledge of
         her surroundings.

     iv) Fourthly, the judge at paragraph 24 rejects the  Appellant's  claim
         that "a customer took pity on her  and  helped  her  escape".   The
         judge has given no reason for this finding and she submits that  it
         is consequently a material error of law.  Finally, so  far  as  the
         Appellant's pregnancy is concerned, the judge has  failed  to  take
         into  account   material   considerations   contending   that   the
         Appellant's account was vague.  She submits that that  is  not  the
         case and then proceeds to set out exact reasons as to why  that  is
         so.

The Law

 7.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

 8. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

 9. An assessment of credibility requires an analysis of the  evidence  and
    the plausibility of that evidence.  The judge has  failed  to  properly
    make such a consideration as is set out in detail  in  the  submissions
    made by Miss Robertson, both orally  and  in  her  written  Grounds  of
    Appeal.

10. In addition, having heard these submissions there is in this instance a
    concession made by Mr Tarlow on behalf of the Secretary of  State  that
    not only are there a number of errors of law in the judge's conclusions
    and lack of findings, but that they are material and that the  decision
    is consequently unsafe, particularly  so  far  as  it  relates  to  the
    Appellant's credibility.  I agree with Mr Tarlow's conclusions.

11. In such circumstances I am satisfied that there are material errors  of
    law throughout the decision that taint it and that the correct approach
    is to set aside the decision and to remit the matter back to the First-
    tier Tribunal for rehearing with none of the findings of fact to stand.



Notice of Decision and Directions

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law
    and the decision is set aside.  Directions are  given  hereinafter  for
    the rehearing of this matter:-

      1) On the finding that  there  are  material  errors  of  law  in  the
         decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge,  the  decision  is  set
         aside with none of the findings of fact to stand.

      2) The matter is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal  sitting  at
         Taylor House on the first available date 28 days hence with an  ELH
         of three hours.

      3) That the appeal is  to  be  before  any  Judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal other than Immigration Judge Ross.

      4) That there be leave to either party to file  and  serve  a  further
         bundle of such subjective and/or objective evidence upon which they
         seek to rely at least seven days prior to the restored hearing.

      5) That an Albanian interpreter do attend the restored hearing.

13. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  granted  the  Appellant  anonymity.   No
    application is made to vary that order and none is made.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

No application is made for a fee award and none is made.
