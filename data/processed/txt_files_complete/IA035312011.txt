Solicitors.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant in  these  proceedings  is  the  Secretary  of  State.
       However, for convenience I refer to the parties as they were  before
       the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. Thus, the appellant is a citizen of  Bulgaria,  born  on  14  August
       1968. He is said to have arrived in the UK illegally using  a  false
       passport in July 1999. He married a British citizen,  C,  in  August
       2000, and the appellant returned to Bulgaria from where  he  applied
       to join his wife in the UK; which application  was  granted.  On  20
       August 2001 he was granted indefinite leave to remain.

    3. On 18 June 2004 he was convicted of offences of conspiracy to import
       class A drugs (cocaine), possession of Class A drugs with intent  to
       supply (cocaine), possession of Class A drugs with intent to  supply
       (ecstasy), conspiracy to supply a Class A drug (cocaine) to a person
       outside the UK, and two counts of being knowingly concerned  in  the
       fraudulent  evasion  of  the  prohibition  or  restriction  on   the
       importation of goods. He received  a  total  sentence  of  18  years
       imprisonment, some of the sentences being concurrent  but  involving
       two sentences of 18 years.

    4. In terms of the offences of which he was convicted, I do not have  a
       copy of the indictment and the information as to the offences  comes
       from the certificate of conviction from the Central Criminal Court.

    5. On 19 January 2011 a decision was made to make a  deportation  order
       under the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006
       ("the EEA Regulations").   His  appeal  against  that  decision  was
       allowed  by  a  Panel  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  consisting  of
       Immigration Judge K. Henderson and non-legal member Mr D.R. Bremner,
       after a hearing on 10 May 2011.

    6. At a hearing on 13 January 2012,  a  Panel  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
       consisting of Mr C.M.G. Ockelton, Vice President, and Upper Tribunal
       Judge Dawson, found that the First-tier Tribunal had  erred  in  law
       and set the decision aside, to be re-made by the Upper Tribunal. The
       error  of  law  decision  is  reproduced  in  an   annex   to   this
       determination, with appropriate anonymisation.

    7. At the hearing before me the appellant gave oral  evidence  which  I
       have summarised.

   Oral evidence

    8. The appellant adopted  his  witness  statements  in  examination-in-
       chief. He said that he  understood  that  if  he  committed  another
       offence deportation proceedings would be taken which would be likely
       to be successful, but he would not commit another  offence.  He  had
       done everything to prove that he is not that kind of person anymore.



    9. He had moved from Doncaster to London as he  was  staying  with  his
       parents-in-law. He is now aged 45 and wants to show that he can look
       after himself and his son, S. There are  more  opportunities  to  do
       this in London. He had tried to find work in Doncaster but  that  is
       difficult enough to do for people from there. He had had to  explain
       that he had probation and immigration appointments. He was trying to
       help his brother-in-law who has a cleaning  business  in  Doncaster.
       His brother-in-law would give him cash at the weekends.  If  he  was
       going to work full time for his brother-in-law that would be in  the
       daytime until evening which would take away his time with  his  son.
       His brother-in-law knew that he could rely on him to do the cleaning
       jobs and then he would put S to bed.

   10. His brother-in-law did not have  sufficient  work  for  him  but  he
       worked when there was work available. He works full time  in  London
       and continues to support his son with the money that  he  earns.  He
       has a very, very close relationship with his son.

   11. In cross-examination he said that he went to the USA  from  Bulgaria
       in 1990 and left there in about October or  November  1998.  He  was
       married in the USA in 1994. It is true that when he met his wife  he
       was dealing drugs in Los Angeles. He worked for two and a half years
       before he started dealing drugs. He began drug dealing in 1993 until
       he was arrested. It is also true that he absconded from bail in  the
       USA to avoid being convicted, and he knows that absconding from bail
       is a criminal offence. He then returned to Bulgaria and then to  the
       UK in 1999 on a false passport which he knew was also illegal. It is
       also true that he was dealing in drugs in the UK before he  met  his
       second wife.

   12. In Bulgaria he has his parents  and  a  sister.  He  is  in  regular
       contact with them and they have visited him in the UK.  He  accepted
       that he was part of the drug gang involved in the offences for which
       he received a sentence of 18 years, although he does not know if  he
       was a full part of it. He had pleaded guilty  to  importation  of  a
       large quantity of cocaine.

   13. He was arrested in January 2002 and first had leave to  remain  from
       September 2000. It is correct that he only had leave  to  remain  in
       the UK for just over a year before he was arrested.

   14. He does consider that he is integrated into life in the UK.  He  has
       family and friends here, loves the  culture,  the  country  and  the
       people. He knows that he has done wrong but there  are  people  here
       who love him and whom he loves. He has been in the UK  a  very  long
       time with these people. He had however, taken a lot  of  things  for
       granted. He does wish that he had integrated better in the beginning
       in the USA and here, and wishes that he had taken a different path.

   15. He is now divorced from his wife, C. The divorce was about two years
       ago. The process started in 2011 when he was released. When  he  was
       released C and his son were living in Doncaster  at  his  mother-in-
       law's address which was not his bail address. It  is  true,  as  his
       witness statement says, that if his mother-in-law was not  receiving
       medical treatment they would be  living  together  as  a  family  in
       London. He and C have a very close relationship as  friends  and  in
       terms of looking after S but they are not in the process of thinking
       that they would live together. However, he thought that by coming to
       London they could all have a  better  life  and  opportunities.  The
       studio flat he lives in is in the same area as where he works. C was
       going to work there too, and eventually C and S would have had their
       own place.

   16. He supports S financially and agrees to pay a  certain  amount  from
       his wages. There is a direct transfer of �200 every two  weeks,  and
       on top of that he pays for things like travel, clothes and  sporting
       activities and when he comes to stay with him for  the  holidays.  C
       works in Doncaster.

   17. S is 11� and will be 12 at the end of August. They had not asked him
       to write a  letter  in  connection  with  the  appeal.  He  is  very
       sensitive and they had not explained to S  where  he  had  been.  He
       would think that he had done something wrong,  but  it  is  all  his
       fault and his own wrongdoing. He does know that the intention of the
       government is to send him to Bulgaria. His lawyers have advised  him
       that it could be beneficial to ask S to  write  in  support  of  the
       appeal but he does not want him to become involved in any  of  this.
       He and C both feel strongly that he does not  want  him  interviewed
       concerning their relationship.

   18. C and S come to visit him every  second  Friday.  They  go  back  at
       6.00pm on Sunday. The following  weekend  he  goes  there;  twice  a
       month. Sometimes he goes in the middle of the week  but  he  has  to
       "sign" on a Tuesday and  report  to  immigration  on  Wednesday.  On
       Monday and Thursday he works a double shift and Friday and  Saturday
       night are the busiest shifts. He goes Sunday morning and comes  back
       Sunday night or early Monday morning. S stays with  him  during  the
       school holidays.

   19. In answer to my questions he said that his relationship  with  C  is
       just as a friend. She does not  have  another  partner.  There  were
       extradition proceedings in relation to the USA offences but  he  was
       not extradited. This is because he had pleaded guilty here and  part
       of the conspiracy was in  the  UK,  so  the  Americans  dropped  the
       extradition proceedings.

   Submissions

   20. Both parties provided detailed and helpful skeleton arguments  which
       I have considered in full.

   21. On behalf of  the  respondent  Mr  Melvin  relied  on  the  skeleton
       argument and the reasons for deportation letter. Reference was  made
       to the appellant's evidence in relation to his drug  offending  both
       in the USA and in the UK. The appellant is only entitled to the most
       basic level of protection against deportation and would have to show
       that prior to his arrest and offending he had integrated  into  life
       in the UK. The nine years that he had spent in prison does not count
       towards integration. It was only in the last three years, since  May
       3013, whilst fighting removal, that he obtained employment. There is
       a letter from his employer but no-one had attended  the  hearing  to
       give evidence. There was no oral evidence from anyone  in  terms  of
       his integration and in terms of his private life.

   22. Having regard to the decisions  in  MG  [2014]  EUECJ  C-400/12  and
       Onukwere [2014] EUECJ C-378/12 the time spent in  prison  cannot  be
       counted in terms of his residence. His conduct clearly shows that he
       has no desire to integrate. The decision in Tsakouridis [2010] EUECJ
       C-145/09 was also relied on.

   23. There was a risk of reoffending.  The  'NOMS'  report  refers  to  a
       medium risk. The propensity to offend  is  linked  to  the  lack  of
       integration.

   24. There was very  little  evidence  to  support  the  claimed  contact
       between the appellant and his son,  and  little  evidence  of  money
       transferred for his upkeep. The whole appeal is based on family life
       with his son, but there is no evidence from him. It is accepted that
       his son is a British citizen but there has been limited contact with
       him in the time before his release and since. His  ex-wife  and  son
       live in Doncaster and he lives in London.

   25. On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that the seriousness  of
       the offence is not sufficient to justify removal. There  must  be  a
       risk of reoffending. In  the  case  of  this  appellant  the  expert
       evidence is that there is a very low risk. His conduct since release
       and when detained at Ford open prison is relevant.

   26. He has continuing contact with  his  son.  I  was  referred  to  the
       appellant's witness statement in terms of why  there  is  no  letter
       from his son or independent social work report. There  was  however,
       other evidence in terms of his relationship with S. The  appellant's
       explanation for why he did not want to involve his son puts his  son
       at the heart of the proceedings. There is nothing  to  suggest  that
       the low risk assessments cannot be accepted. The appellant is  aware
       that any offence would make him liable to deportation.

   My assessment

   27. Directive 2004/38/EC ("the Directive" or "Citizens'  Directive")  is
       transposed into UK domestic law by  the  EEA  Regulations.  The  EEA
       Regulations concerning exclusion and removal from the UK provide  as
       follows:

     "Exclusion and removal from the United Kingdom

     19.- ...

             (3) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), an EEA national who  has
             entered the United Kingdom or  the  family  member  of  such  a
             national who has entered the United Kingdom may be removed if-

             (a) that person does not have or ceases  to  have  a  right  to
             reside under these Regulations; or

             (b) the Secretary  of  State  has  decided  that  the  person's
             removal is  justified  on  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health in accordance with regulation 21.

             (4) A person must not be removed under  paragraph  (3)  as  the
             automatic  consequence  of  having  recourse  to   the   social
             assistance system of the United Kingdom.

             (5) A person must not be removed under paragraph (3) if he  has
             a right to remain in the United  Kingdom  by  virtue  of  leave
             granted under the 1971 Act unless his removal is  justified  on
             the grounds of public policy, public security or public  health
             in accordance with regulation 21.

             ...

             Decisions taken on public policy, public  security  and  public
             health grounds

             21.-(1) In this regulation a "relevant decision" means  an  EEA
             decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security
             or public health.

             (2) A relevant decision may not  be  taken  to  serve  economic
             ends.

             (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a person
             with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except
             on serious grounds of public policy or public security.

             (4) A relevant decision may not be taken except  on  imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

             (a) has resided in the United Kingdom for a  continuous  period
             of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or

             (b) is under the age of 18, unless  the  relevant  decision  is
             necessary in  his  best  interests,  as  provided  for  in  the
             Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted  by  the  General
             Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989(11).

             (5) Where a relevant decision is taken  on  grounds  of  public
             policy or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying
             with the preceding paragraphs of this regulation, be  taken  in
             accordance with the following principles-

             (a)  the  decision  must   comply   with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;

             (b) the decision must be  based  exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;

             (c) the personal conduct of the person concerned must represent
             a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting
             one of the fundamental interests of society;

             (d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case or  which
             relate to considerations of general prevention do  not  justify
             the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not   in
             themselves justify the decision.

             (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of  public
             policy or public security  in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
             resident in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take
             account of considerations such as the  age,  state  of  health,
             family and economic  situation  of  the  person,  the  person's
             length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's  social
             and cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent
             of the person's links with his country of origin."

   28. In order to set my conclusions in context, I set out in summary  the
       brief circumstances of the offences  for  which  the  appellant  was
       sentenced, on the basis of the information put before me, and  which
       led to the decision to deport him to Bulgaria.

   29. I have not been provided with the sentencing remarks  given  at  the
       time of the sentence of 18 years imprisonment. However, it is  clear
       enough from the extracts of  the  sentencing  remarks  in  the  NOMS
       report that the offences involved  involvement  in  a  sophisticated
       gang of international drug dealers, with the appellant operating the
       UK end of a "drugs ring" to make a "huge  profit  in  an  enterprise
       that causes misery to many lives". The report continues that on  two
       occasions deals involved 20 Kg of cocaine  at  100%  purity  with  a
       street value of just short of  "#1,000,000"  (sic).  Notwithstanding
       whatever encouragement he received  from  an  informant,  the  judge
       concluded that he willingly took part. He was given credit  for  his
       guilty pleas although the judge said  that  it  would  not  be  much
       credit as he knew all along that he was guilty. The  judge  assessed
       his role as a "significant participant".

   30. The appellant arrived in the UK in 1999 and has  therefore  been  in
       the UK for some 15 years. However, the  decision  of  the  Court  of
       Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") in Case C-400/12 MG states as
       follows:

           "31   ...when   interpreting   Article   16(2)   of    Directive
           2004/38,...the  fact  that  a  national  court  has  imposed   a
           custodial sentence is an indication that  the  person  concerned
           has not respected the values of the society of the  host  Member
           State,  as  reflected  in  its  criminal  law,  and   that,   in
           consequence,  the  taking  into  consideration  of  periods   of
           imprisonment for the purposes of the acquisition, by members  of
           the family of a Union citizen who are not nationals of a  Member
           State, of the right of permanent residence  as  referred  to  in
           Article 16(2) of Directive 2004/38 would clearly be contrary  to
           the aim pursued by that directive in establishing that right  of
           residence (Case C-378/12 Onuekwere [2014] ECR I-0000,  paragraph
           26).


           32 Since the degree of integration of the persons concerned is a
           vital consideration underpinning both  the  right  of  permanent
           residence  and  the  system  of  protection  against   expulsion
           measures established by Directive 2004/38, the reasons making it
           justifiable for periods of imprisonment not  to  be  taken  into
           consideration for the purposes of granting a right of  permanent
           residence or for such periods to be regarded as interrupting the
           continuity of the period of residence  needed  to  acquire  that
           right must also be  borne  in  mind  when  interpreting  Article
           28(3)(a) of that directive.

           33 It follows that periods of imprisonment cannot be taken  into
           account for the purposes of  granting  the  enhanced  protection
           provided for in Article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 and  that,
           in principle, such  periods  interrupt  the  continuity  of  the
           period of residence for the purposes of that provision."

   31. The effect of that decision in the case of this appellant is that he
       has not acquired protection against expulsion at a level other  than
       the lowest, or most basis level, that is to say on grounds of public
       policy, public security or public health. He received  his  sentence
       of imprisonment on 18 June 2004 by which time he had not been in the
       UK for five years. His period of imprisonment could not  be  counted
       as qualifying residence, and in any event his imprisonment broke the
       continuity of residence.

   32. Mr  Lewis  attempted  to  suggest,  if  I  understood  the  argument
       correctly, that the appellant's indefinite leave to remain  had  not
       been curtailed and  thus  he  has  permanent  residence  within  the
       meaning of the Directive. However, I am satisfied that the  combined
       effect of Regulation 24(3) of the EEA Regulations and  section  5(1)
       of the Immigration Act 1971 is that his indefinite leave  to  remain
       was revoked with the decision to remove him.  Mr  Lewis'  fall  back
       position in this regard was that in any  event  the  fact  that  the
       appellant had indefinite leave to remain was relevant to  the  issue
       of proportionality.

   33. Plainly a relevant, indeed vital, consideration  is  the  extent  to
       which the appellant could be said to present a risk of  reoffending.
       This is because, as set out in the EEA Regulations, under regulation
       21(5)(c)  "the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned   must
       represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious   threat
       affecting one of the fundamental interests of society".

   34. In addition, regulation 21(5)(d)  provides  that  "matters  isolated
       from the particulars of the case or which relate  to  considerations
       of general prevention do not justify the decision".

   35. In relation to risk of reoffending, the National Offender Management
       Service report ("NOMS") which appears to have been prepared in 2010,
       stated that there was a medium risk of  reconviction  and  a  medium
       risk of harm to others. A  report  by  a  probation  officer,  Peter
       Brown, dated 3 May 2011, assessed the appellant as at  that  time  a
       low risk of serious harm to the public  and  to  known  adults.  The
       further report from Peter Brown dated 14 May 2012 in the appellant's
       supplemental bundle gives the same assessment. A letter  from  Helen
       Thompson from the London Probation Trust, dated 18 March 2014,  also
       assessed the appellant as presenting a low risk of serious harm  and
       a low risk of reoffending.

   36. There are two  reports  from  Lisa  Davies,  a  Consultant  Forensic
       Psychologist. The first is dated 6 September 2012.  In  that  report
       the assessment is that the appellant was  at  low  risk  of  general
       reoffending, which I take to be equivalent to the same level of risk
       in terms of 'reconviction' (see 1.2 and  1.3  of  the  report).  The
       second report dated 28 March 2014 makes the assessments of "very low
       risk  of  general  reoffending"  and  "very  low  risk   range   for
       reconviction for general (non-violent) offences". At 12.10  it  also
       states that there was then a "very low risk of harm to others".

   37.  It is evident from all the  reports  which  consider  the  risk  of
       reoffending that the appellant has fully complied with the terms  of
       his  licence  and  has  demonstrated  a  positive  attitude  towards
       attending  appointments  with  his  probation   officer,   including
       engaging  well  during  supervision  sessions.  He   has   evidently
       demonstrated a good understanding of the effects of his offending on
       society in general and on him and his family. He  does  not  display
       any inclination towards further offending and appears to be  focused
       on legitimate employment. He has given an  account  to  Lisa  Davies
       which indicates a responsible attitude to society and to  his  plans
       for the future.

   38. I note however, what is written in the earlier report at  paragraphs
       5.1.2-5.1.4 in that on the Paulhus Deception  Scale  ('PDS')  he  is
       said to have scored a  "clinically  significant"  figure  for  'Self
       Deceptive Enhancement' which indicates "an unconscious favourability
       bias closely related to narcissism". High scores on that  scale  are
       said to indicate "a rigid over confidence". The report  goes  on  to
       state that a high score in that respect does  not  imply  deliberate
       intent to deceive others and is likely to be a result of a need  for
       approval of self esteem.  I assume however, that the score  in  this
       respect has been taken into account in Ms Davies assessment  of  the
       risk of reoffending.

   39. Ms Davies refers to a wide range of factors that she  considered  in
       making her assessment as to the risk of reoffending,  which  is  now
       said to be very low. These include, but are  not  limited  to,  past
       behaviour,  employment,  his  attitude  of  his  offences,  lack  of
       criminal associations, and identification with pro-social  and  non-
       criminal models. A further significant factor  in  this  respect  is
       said to be his relationship with his son  which  at  6.1.17  of  the
       September 2012 report is described as  "an  important  and  relevant
       motivational factor" for his avoiding future offending.

   40. I have considered all of the witness statements, in particular those
       of the appellant and what he says about his determination not to re-
       offend. In this connection the appellant particularly refers to  his
       relationship with his son. I accept that  they  have  a  very  close
       relationship and that the appellant wants to  maintain  and  develop
       their relationship.

   41. However, I do not accept that the appellant's risk of reoffending is
       low. At 6.1.1 of the first of her reports,  Ms  Davies  states  that
       past behaviour is invariably the best predictor of future behaviour,
       and that "This is very true  of  criminal  behaviour,  where  almost
       every research study in this country  and  abroad  has  demonstrated
       that  criminal  history  is  a  very  good   predictor   of   future
       reconviction".  Whilst  I  accept  that  Ms  Davies  refers  to  the
       appellant's history of drug related offences (paragraph 6.1.3 of the
       September 2012  report),  and  sets  out  the  appellant's  history,
       including in the USA, I am not satisfied that her  assessment  takes
       that history fully into account or gives it sufficient weight.

   42. The appellant's evidence before me was that he went to  the  USA  in
       1990 from Bulgaria and married in 1994. He said that when he met his
       wife he was already dealing in drugs in Los Angeles, having  started
       drug dealing in 1993. He was arrested in the USA  in  1998.  He  was
       arrested for the offences in the UK in January 2002. His involvement
       in serious drugs offending has therefore spanned a period  of  about
       nine years. Against that background, I do not consider that the fact
       that he has not committed any offences since his release from prison
       (in January or February 2011)  to  be  of  very  much  significance,
       particularly considering the fact that he is, and was, aware that he
       is facing deportation.

   43. In addition, notwithstanding that he was  arrested  in  the  USA  in
       1998, he absconded from bail and returned to  Bulgaria.  It  appears
       that apart from absconding from bail in the USA he left the  country
       without a passport (4.6.6 of Ms Davies first  report).  In  evidence
       before me he accepted that he then came to the UK illegally, using a
       false passport. Notwithstanding that there were matters  outstanding
       against him in the USA, and having  entered  the  UK  illegally,  he
       became involved in the offences which resulted in the total sentence
       of 18 years imprisonment. The NOMS report on page 7 states that  the
       offences took place between 1 December 1999 and 25 January 2002.  It
       would appear therefore, that he committed those  offences  not  long
       after he had arrived in the UK illegally.

   44. Although I accept what is said about  reoffending  being,  in  part,
       related to employment,  the  fact  is  that  the  appellant  was  in
       employment in the USA when he started his offending.   He  explained
       to Ms Davies that he had a stable upbringing in Bulgaria and a close
       relationship with his parents. That was  his  background  before  he
       went to the USA and committed drugs offences. When he married in the
       UK he was involved in the offences which resulted in the decision to
       make a deportation order.

   45. Whilst I accept that he has not previously had children, and in that
       sense his family circumstances are now very different, the  fact  is
       that in the past neither  employment,  marriage  nor  stable  family
       circumstances prevented him from offending and continuing to offend.
       I do not consider that the conclusion that he presents a very low or
       even low risk of reoffending has sufficient regard to those matters.
       I also bear in mind that both in the NOMS report at [11] and  in  Ms
       Davies first report  at  4.6.4,  the  appellant  explained  that  he
       enjoyed the  lifestyle  that  his  involvement  with  illicit  drugs
       afforded him.

   46. I have no doubt that the appellant well understands the  harm  posed
       to society, and to his family, by the sort of offences he  committed
       which resulted in the decision to make the deportation order. I also
       have no doubt that he has engaged well with supervision and does not
       display any inclination to reoffend, and that he does not  associate
       with those with whom he was involved in the offences which  resulted
       in his 18 year prison sentence. However,  for  the  reasons  I  have
       given I do not accept the assessment of the risk of offending as low
       or very low.

   47. In relation to whether he presents a  risk  of  'serious  harm'  the
       reports from Mr Brown, Ms Thompson and that from  Ms  Davies  use  a
       definition of serious harm which is described at 6.3.7 of Ms Davies'
       first report as the standard definition of the phrase. To quote from
       the report of Ms Thompson dated  18  March  2014,  serious  harm  is
       defined as "the likelihood of an event  which  is  life  threatening
       and/or traumatic, and  from  which  recovery,  whether  physical  or
       psychological, can be expected to be difficult or  impossible".  All
       of the authors of the reports note the seriousness of  the  offences
       for which the appellant was convicted  and  the  impact  of  serious
       drugs offending on the community. However, whilst that definition of
       serious harm may have  its  uses  in  some  contexts,  it  does  not
       adequately represent the very serious harm to individuals,  families
       and to society  generally,  from  the  introduction  and  subsequent
       distribution and use of Class A drugs.

   48. I have considered all the matters that are advanced on his behalf as
       indicating a low or very low risk of reoffending.  Relevant  factors
       include his stable employment, his relationship with  his  son,  his
       son's mother, and other family  members  in  the  UK,  the  lack  of
       further offences,  the  courses  he  has  undertaken,  his  positive
       response to supervision and his positive prison record in  terms  of
       adjudications or offences.

   49.  However,  in  my  judgment  the  risk  of   reoffending   is   more
       appropriately to be considered as a medium risk, as it was found  to
       be in the NOMS report in 2010, notwithstanding  that  the  appellant
       has not committed any offences since then  and  notwithstanding  his
       good behaviour whilst serving his sentence.

   50. I am  satisfied  that  the  appellant's  conduct  does  represent  a
       genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one  of
       the fundamental interests of society. This conclusion  follows  from
       the risk of his reoffending, and from the form that that reoffending
       is likely  to  take  in  terms  of  involvement  in  the  supply  or
       distribution of Class A drugs.

   51. The importation  and  distribution  of  Class  A  drugs  undoubtedly
       represents  a  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
       interests of society,  having  regard  to  the  almost  incalculable
       social and personal cost of the use of Class A drugs.

   52. Matters of general deterrence have no part to play in my  assessment
       of the decision to remove the appellant, and I  have  no  regard  to
       such considerations. I bear in mind the other principles set out  in
       regulation 21(5), including that the decision must comply  with  the
       principle of proportionality, and the matters set out in  regulation
       21(6).

   53. A particularly relevant  factor  in  proportionality  terms  is  the
       appellant's relationship with his son. As I have already  indicated,
       I am satisfied that he has a close relationship  with  his  son  and
       plays a significant part in his life, as the witness statements  and
       oral evidence demonstrate.  Notwithstanding  my  assessment  of  the
       appellant's propensity to reoffend, I am satisfied that it is in his
       son's best interests for the appellant to remain in the UK. For many
       obvious reasons it would not be reasonable to expect his son  to  go
       to Bulgaria to be with the appellant, however that may be achieved.

   54. I note  that  no  evidence  has  been  served  in  response  to  the
       Directions I made as long ago as 18 May  2012  in  terms  of  'third
       party' evidence in relation to the best interests of the appellant's
       son. I make that observation only to highlight the fact that no such
       evidence was put before me. I also  note  however,  the  appellant's
       evidence of his not having  wanted  to  involve  his  son  in  these
       proceedings.

   55. S is now only 11 years of age, nearly 12. Self evidently a child  of
       that age would need or benefit from the close contact and support of
       both parents. Furthermore, I have  no  doubt  that  the  appellant's
       removal to Bulgaria will have a significant emotional impact on  his
       son. If support were needed for that view, it is  contained  in  the
       letter dated 3 April 2014, from the  appellant's  former  mother-in-
       law, Mrs LS. She refers to  the  devastating  effect  on  S  of  the
       appellant's removal.

   56. The contact that the appellant and his son would be able to maintain
       from Bulgaria, by means of phone calls, letters, Skype, or visits to
       Bulgaria, would be no substitute for the  close  contact  that  they
       both presently enjoy.

   57. I also accept that even though the appellant and his  son's  mother,
       C, are no longer  in  a  relationship,  they  both  share  a  mutual
       interest in securing what is best for their son. The removal of  the
       appellant would  affect  C  in  that  respect.  On  the  appellant's
       evidence she and he maintain a close relationship. Although her most
       recent witness statement dated 6 April 2014 does not  refer  to  the
       affect on her directly of the appellant's removal, I accept that  it
       is likely that his removal would  also  affect  her  emotionally  in
       addition to in the way just described.

   58.   I   take   into   account   what   is   said   in    Essa    (EEA:
       rehabilitation/integration) [2013] UKUT 00316 (IAC) in  relation  to
       integration and rehabilitation. The appellant initially  arrived  in
       the UK in 1999, returned to Bulgaria and then married in the  UK  in
       2000. He  was  however,  arrested  in  January  2002  but  had  been
       committing the offences for which he was arrested well before  that.
       It seems that he was in prison from the time of his arrest until his
       release in January 2011. Although  he  has  not  committed  offences
       since his release, has been and is in employment, and has  developed
       his relationship with his son and others, this is not much  evidence
       of integration into UK society in the light  of  his  offending  and
       lengthy prison sentence. His offences demonstrate a significant lack
       of integration.  Furthermore, I do not consider that there are short
       or medium term prospects for rehabilitation, taking into account  my
       conclusion as to the risk of reoffending and the  reasons  for  that
       conclusion.

   59. Many of the matters to which I have already referred relate  to  the
       factors that must also be considered  under  regulation  21(6),  for
       example the extent of his social and cultural integration  into  the
       UK. I bear in mind that he was granted indefinite leave to remain in
       August 2001. As against that, he did not show much respect for  that
       status that was afforded to him.  He  is  aged  45,  almost  46.  He
       appears to be in good health. He has his parents  and  a  sister  in
       Bulgaria and he said that  he  is  in  regular  contact  with  them.
       Clearly he still has links with Bulgaria therefore. He has family in
       the UK in terms of his Son, his ex-wife,  C,  and  her  parents.  No
       doubt he also has friends in the UK.

   60. Having taken all relevant matters into consideration, I am satisfied
       that the appellant's deportation is  warranted  on  the  grounds  of
       public policy, as  well  as  public  security,  but  the  former  is
       sufficient. The element of public security is involved in  terms  of
       the appellant's propensity to offend in relation to Class A drugs, a
       matter considered in Tsakouridis [2010] EUECJ C-145/09.

   61. His removal does comply with the principle of proportionality and is
       based exclusively  on  his  personal  conduct.  The  appellant  does
       represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious   threat
       affecting one of the fundamental interests of society,  and  I  have
       taken into account the  factors  required  to  be  considered  under
       regulation 21(6).

   62. In the light of those conclusions, I do not consider  that  separate
       consideration under Article 8 of the ECHR would yield any  different
       result, notwithstanding the  detailed  submissions  in  relation  to
       Article 8 in the appellant's skeleton argument.

Decision

   63. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is
       set aside and the decision re-made dismissing the appeal  under  the
       EEA Regulations and under Article 8 of the ECHR.



Anonymity

Given that these proceedings include consideration of matters related  to  a
child, I make an order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal)  Rules  2008.  Consequently,  this  determination  identifies  the
appellant's  child  and  the  adults  associated  with  him,  including  the
appellant, by initials only in order  to  preserve  the  anonymity  of  that
child. No report of these proceedings may, directly or indirectly,  lead  to
the identification of that child. Failure  to  observe  the  terms  of  this
Order may result in proceedings for contempt of court.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and background

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal constituted by  Judge  Henderson  and  a  non-legal
    member, allowing the appeal of the appellant before them  (to  whom  we
    shall refer  as  the  'claimant')  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to make a deportation order against him.

 2. The claimant is a national of Bulgaria. He was born in 1968; he came to
    the United Kingdom in July 1999; he married a British citizen; he  left
    the United Kingdom then, apparently  voluntarily;  he  re-entered  with
    entry clearance and leave to enter as the spouse of a British  citizen.
    He was subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain.

 3. It appears that at the time of his entry to the United Kingdom, he  was
    in breach of conditions of bail imposed by a court in the United States
    of America in relation to charges of drug offences.  He was arrested on
    25 January 2002 in relation to  those  charges,  that  is  to  say  the
    American charges, and there were subsequently charges  in  relation  to
    drug offences in this country.   He  eventually  pleaded  guilty  to  a
    number of counts, six in all, and was sentenced to a total of 18  years
    imprisonment by His Honour Judge Stephens QC, at the  Central  Criminal
    Court in 2004.

 4. In imposing that sentence, the judge  indicated  that  the  charges  on
    which the longest  sentences  were  imposed  were  in  respect  of  the
    claimant's part in a sophisticated gang of international drug  dealers.
    He was operating part of the United Kingdom end of a drugs ring, making
    very substantial profits.  There were two deals involving 20  kilograms
    of cocaine of 100% purity with a street value just short of �1 million;
    there were other attempts to arrange deals on his own behalf.  Although
    the claimant had in  the  end,  pleaded  guilty,  he  had  undergone  a
    considerable series of hearings at which he had claimed to be  able  to
    meet the charges put to him.  The Judge gave very little credit to  the
    eventual guilty pleas on the basis that the  claimant  knew  all  along
    that he was guilty.  The sentences were concurrent.  There were two  of
    18 years, one of 10 years, one of 8 years and one of  4  years.   There
    was also a confiscation order.

 5. By the time the claimant was arrested in January  2002,  his  wife  was
    pregnant and she subsequently gave birth to  a  son.   The  birth  took
    place whilst the claimant was in  prison.   The  claimant  remained  in
    prison from his arrest in  2002  until  he  had  finished  serving  his
    sentence, which was on the usual basis, about nine years later, that is
    to say half of the eighteen years to which he was  sentenced.   He  was
    released on bail following a short period of immigration detention on 3
    February 2011.  So far as we are aware he remains subject to the  terms
    of a licence on his release at the end of the criminal sentence.

 6. The basis of the claimant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was  that
    he is married to a British citizen and that he has a son who  was  born
    in this  country  and  with  whom  he  maintains  a  strong  and  close
    relationship.  It was said that he poses a low risk of reoffending  and
    that his  removal  would  be  disproportionate,  bearing  in  mind  the
    protection from removal that citizens of the European  Union  enjoy  in
    other countries of the European Union.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal, as we have said,  allowed  his  appeal.   They
    dealt with the matters before them under two heads, dealing first  with
    the proportionality  of  the  claimant's  removal  (apparently  without
    taking into account his family life) and  secondly  Article  8  issues,
    dealing with family and private life.  The  Tribunal's  conclusion  was
    that each of those grounds, separately and  individually,  merited  the
    appeals being allowed.

 8. The Secretary of State appeals to this Tribunal on the grounds that, in
    making its decision, the First-tier Tribunal made errors of law.

Decision

 9. We are persuaded that the First-tier Tribunal's decision is  marred  by
    error of law and we shall set the determination aside.  We  propose  to
    give reasons for that conclusion, then make some general marks and give
    further directions.  Because the appeal will need  to  be  re-heard  we
    will  attempt  to  avoid  making  comments  in  the  course   of   this
    determination that may have any effect on any future findings  of  fact
    or credibility; and nothing we say in the course of this  determination
    should be taken as an indication of what  we  consider  should  be  the
    proper outcome of the appeal when it is re-heard.

Reasons

10. First then, the reasons why we  set  aside  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination. The determination, signed by both of the members of  the
    panel is 32 pages long; it consists of 93 paragraphs and, as  has  been
    pointed out, that is sufficient to show that a  substantial  number  of
    matters were taken into account in  producing  it.   It  sets  out  the
    respective cases of the claimant and the respondent, and  the  law  and
    then there is a section entitled 'The Hearing'.  'Findings of Fact'  is
    the final section; it  consists  of  paragraphs  58  to  93.   And  the
    Findings of Fact include as we have said, separate determinations  that
    the  claimant's  deportation  would  not  satisfy  the  requirement  of
    proportionality imposed by reg 21 of the Immigration (European Economic
    Area)  Regulations  2006,  and  that  taking  account  of  his   family
    circumstances his deportation would cause the United Kingdom to  be  in
    breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

11. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal as addressed by Ms Rackstraw
    before us raise a number of issues.  The  first,  and  it  is  probably
    right to characterise it as the overarching, ground is that  the  panel
    failed to take into account the seriousness of the  offences  of  which
    the claimant had been convicted and the public interest in deportation.
     In her submissions, Ms Rackstraw  described  that  failure  as  having
    skewed the panel's approach to  the  rest  of  the  issues  before  it.
    Secondly, Ms Rackstraw says that the panel failed  properly  to  assess
    the risk of the claimant's re-offending.  Thirdly, the panel failed  to
    assess  properly  the  credibility  of  the  evidence  before  it,   in
    particular  as  regards  the  relationships  between  family   members.
    Fourthly, if the interests of the claimant's child were  found  to  lie
    with the claimant being allowed to remain the panel failed  to  explain
    why those interests were not displaced on a proper  balancing  exercise
    by the public interest in having him deported.

12. In response, Mr Yeo reminds us that the  Reasons  for  Decision  letter
    issued by the Secretary of State  dealt  in  a  summary  way  with  the
    offence itself and extensively with the  liability  to  re-offend.   He
    points out that at a number of points in the determination,  the  panel
    refer to the offences being serious ones.  He  indicates,  if  we  have
    understood him correctly, that it was wrong to separate  the  issue  of
    proportionality under the European Economic Area Regulations 2006  from
    the issue of proportionality under Article 8, because it was  necessary
    in dealing with the first issue to deal with family matters in order to
    ensure that the question of  proportionality  was  properly  and  fully
    considered, but he says that that error, if it be one, is not  material
    because the panel in any event came to a conclusion in  favour  of  the
    claimant on each of those issues.   He  reminds  us  of  the  words  of
    Baroness Hale in particular, in the decision of the Supreme Court in ZH
    Tanzania [2011] UKSC 4.  He opposes Ms Rackstraw's suggestion that  the
    facts of the present case are materially different from ZH.  He reminds
    us that it is the principle that is of  importance:  the  principle  is
    that derived not only from s 55 of the  2009  Act  but  also  from  the
    United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It is  that  the
    best interests of the child are a primary consideration.  Insofar as he
    has to meet the points made by the Secretary of State  that  the  panel
    failed to deal properly with credibility matters, he  asks  us  to  say
    that it is apparent that the panel accepted all the evidence  that  was
    before them on the claimant's behalf.

13. Mr Yeo did his  very  best  to  save  this  determination  and  we  are
    confident that little more than he said  could  conceivably  have  been
    said in its favour.  He indicated that it would be unfortunate  if  the
    matter had to be gone through again at a fresh hearing.  We agree  with
    that last submission, but, as we  have  indicated,  we  find  ourselves
    unable to accept his other submissions.

14. It seems to us that all of the Secretary of State's  grounds  are  made
    out.  This was evidently a serious  case  requiring  the  most  careful
    consideration  of  any  factors  raised   against   deportation.    The
    determination itself has a  number  of  features  suggesting  that  the
    matter did not have the care it deserved.   There are many misprints in
    the determination.  Paragraph 16 of the determination reads as follows:-



        "16. The appellant's son  [S]  was  told  that  the  appellant  was
        working away from home and could not come  home  because  of  this.
        The appellant saved is monitored by [S] presents.   [S]  would  not
        open the presents in prison  waited  until  he  got  home  to  show
        everybody what his father had given him"


    We can make no sense at all of the middle sentence.   At  paragraph  31
    the panel writes as follows:

        "31. In completing the appellant's assessment the offender  manager
        found  the  appellant  poster  medium  risk  of  reoffending.    In
        assessing the appellant as a medium risk it  was  acknowledge  that
        there  were  identifiable  indicators  that  would  seek   him   to
        reoffend."

    We can understand  those  sentences  as  we  can  understand  the  last
    sentence of the determination which we set out later: but it  is  clear
    that the panel did not properly review what  was  being  written.   The
    same perhaps applies to the passage between  paragraph  79  and  83  in
    which  the  panel  departs  from  using  the  first  person  plural  in
    indicating its conclusions and moves  to  the  first  person  singular:
    whether or not that was because the judge used a passage which she  had
    drafted for occasions when she was  sitting  alone,  we  do  not  know.
    These are not of themselves important matters, but they  do  show  that
    the determination was not properly read  and  checked  and  they  count
    against  any  suggestion  that  one  should  have  confidence  in   the
    Tribunal's doing its task properly.

15. Another feature of the determination which is marked by  the  Secretary
    of State in her grounds is that the determination fails to indicate  in
    terms what evidence  was  given  at  the  hearing.   The  part  of  the
    determination headed 'The Hearing' runs from paragraph 44 to  paragraph
    57; it sets out questions asked of each of the witnesses.  We think  it
    is right to say that in not one case does it record an answer to any of
    the questions.  The result is that the evidence taken at the hearing is
    not recorded as such in the determination at all.  We do not of  course
    say that it is the function of a determination or a judgement to record
    evidence, but it is the function of a  determination  to  explain  what
    findings of fact and assessment of credibility are made and why.  As we
    have said Mr Yeo's submission was that  the  concluding  parts  of  the
    determination show  that  the  panel  found  all  the  evidence  to  be
    credible: but there is no indication in the determination as to how  it
    came to be the case that all the challenges to the evidence, apparently
    made in questions in cross-examination, as well as the challenges  made
    to various factors in the letter of refusal,  were  regarded  as  being
    without merit.  Nor is there any indication in the determination of how
    it came to be that differences between the official documents  and  the
    other evidence relating to re-offending was  dealt  with.   Nor  is  it
    clear how the panel took into account a matter which  we  have  already
    mentioned: the judge in his sentencing remarks appears to have taken  a
    very clear view about the claimant's honesty in maintaining an  account
    that he was not guilty when he knew that he was.

16. There are other factors in the assessment of important issues in  which
    the panel appear to us to err.  One factor which we  mentioned  at  the
    hearing was that one of the few clear  pieces  of  evidence  which  the
    panel do mention is that the claimant had been free  of  drugs  for  36
    months in prison.  That is of course something which is very  far  from
    being to his discredit, but nobody has suggested that he is a drug-user
    who is reformed.  He is a person who has been involved in the supply of
    drugs to others, not so far as we  are  aware,  a  user  himself.   The
    panel's citation of that particular piece  of  evidence  suggests  that
    they regarded it as of some importance.  Mr Yeo is of course  right  to
    point out that the panel did refer to the offences  as  being  serious,
    but reading the determination as we do, we are very far from  confident
    that the panel  took  into  account  properly  either  the  very  great
    seriousness  of  these  offences  or  the  public  interest  which   is
    particularly high  in  responding  to  the  most  serious  offences  by
    deportation.   The  latter  factor   is   hardly   mentioned   in   the
    determination, if at all.  So far as the former factor is concerned  it
    seems to us that paying lip service to the characterisation of offences
    of this sort as serious is simply not enough.  A  few  of  the  factors
    pointing to the seriousness of the offences  were  mentioned,  but  the
    panel's actual view of them is perhaps most clearly indicated by  their
    description of these offences  in  their  final  conclusion  as  "moral
    failures".  That does not seem to us to be a remotely adequate  way  of
    describing a  clearly  calculated  series  of  offences  involving  the
    international importation of the most serious drugs with  a  very  high
    street value and to which the response of the criminal  justice  system
    was a very long prison sentence.

17. It does not appear that the Tribunal was referred to  the  decision  of
    the CJEU in case C-145/09 Land Baden-W�rttenburg v  Tsakourides.   That
    decision might with advantage be considered when  this  appeal  is  re-
    heard.

18. Finally, in dealing with defects in the determination, we must look  at
    the way in which the best interests of the child  were  assessed.   The
    position is that the panel were persuaded that the relationship between
    the claimant and his child,  despite  the  difficulties  posed  by  the
    claimant's incarceration for a considerable period  since  the  child's
    birth, was nevertheless strong.  That was their finding of  fact.   The
    question whether the case nevertheless demanded deportation despite the
    best interest of the child was a question which  the  panel  needed  to
    answer.  Although Mr Yeo did his very best to show us  the  answer,  we
    cannot see it.  The panel identified the best interests  of  the  child
    and stopped there.  The  last  sentence  of  the  determination  is  as
    follows:

        "We consider that the interests of the child in this appeal are  of
        primary importance and that it is not in the interest of this child
        are not best served [sic] by the removal of his father with whom he
        has built up very close bonds."

19. That may well be the case; having reached that  conclusion,  the  panel
    needed to determine whether the seriousness of these offences  and  the
    public interest in deportation was  sufficient  to  outweigh  the  best
    interests of the child in this particular case.

20. For those reasons, we have concluded that  the  determination  errs  in
    law.  The matters are not matters which can be dealt with on the  basis
    of any simple corrections and we shall set aside the determination.





General Comments

21. We take this opportunity to make some general comments about  cases  of
    this nature.  We emphasise that we  do  not  intend  to  influence  the
    outcome of this particular appeal at all.

22. We are aware that cases in which  the  Tribunal  allows  a  deportation
    appeal in respect of a person who has committed serious offences  cause
    attention outside the Tribunal and more generally in the media.   These
    comments are not intended as a response to any such interest but merely
    to indicate the principles which the Upper  Tribunal  will  attempt  to
    apply in making a decision such as that which we make today.

23. Comments made outside Tribunal hearings are nearly always made  without
    any proper knowledge of the facts of the case.  In a  democracy  it  is
    for the judiciary to make decisions on  appeals,  taking  all  relevant
    facts into account. In that statement the word 'all' is crucial.  In  a
    case such as this,  the  starting  point  will  nearly  always  be  the
    sentencing  remarks  of  the  trial  judge.   Those  remarks   are   an
    authoritative statement both of the nature  of  the  offence,  and  its
    seriousness, and society's response to it through the criminal  justice
    system.  All of those factors are important.  Criminal judges are  able
    to see offences in the context of  the  system  which  they  administer
    every day.  When it is right to describe an offence as serious, they do
    so and impose a commensurate sentence.  When, on  the  other  hand,  an
    offence that may have had very serious consequences is  not  one  which
    (taking everything  into  account)  demands  a  serious  penalty,  they
    indicate that by the penalty that they impose. It is  not  for  anybody
    outside the process of criminal appeals to revisit that assessment.

24. Then, in an appeal against deportation, the  panel  will  be  taking  a
    large number of factors into account, not all  of  which  can  be  made
    wholly public; some of the factors to be taken into account are matters
    of particularly personal intimate relevance, other matters  may  relate
    to the welfare of children, or other people under a disability.  It  is
    not in the public interest for every such factor  to  be  disclosed  in
    detail. In such a case, those not involved in it can never have all the
    material the Tribunal considered.

25. A particular factor which may have to be taken into account is the  way
    in which the Secretary of State has dealt with  the  appellant  in  the
    past.  For many of the last fifteen years it has been the case that the
    Secretary of  State  has  often  done  little  or  nothing  to  enforce
    immigration decisions.  Whether that was  the  result  of  large  scale
    inefficiency or an undisclosed policy, or something  else,  we  do  not
    know.  But if time has passed after the offence,  after  completion  of
    the sentence, and after the exhaustion of  any  appeal,  in  which  the
    Secretary of State could deport a person but has not done so, it may be
    difficult at a later date for the Secretary of State to  say  that  the
    public interest now requires his removal. If it did not require removal
    then, why does it now?

26. The Tribunal in hearing  an  appeal  will  take  account  of  all  such
    matters.  It is the Tribunal's job to do so.  The issue is not  one  of
    discretion; it is not one of penaly;  it  is  not  one  of  whether  to
    exercise leniency or severity. It is a matter of assessment of evidence
    and the balancing of interests.  The interests are often competing, but
    when rights  are  identified  they  demand  respect;  and  it  must  be
    remembered that the purpose  of  the  evolution  of  the  Human  Rights
    jurisdiction is to ensure that the rights of individuals  are  properly
    recognised in individual decisions, and are not subsumed within general
    impressions, or left to the mercy of uninformed condemnation.

27. For these reasons the proper response in a  democratic  society  is  to
    accept the role of the judiciary in making judgements of this sort: but
    that acceptance must depend on evidence that judgments of  this  nature
    are being made properly, taking all the factors including  such  things
    as the seriousness of the offence and the public interest into account,
    as well as the individual matters raised by an appellant.

28. Tribunals dealing with  these  issues  need  to  be  aware  that  their
    decisions are in the public eye.  There may  often  be  decisions  that
    raise questions in the public mind.  There may be  public  disagreement
    expressed: but the aim  is  that  judicial  process  should  result  in
    acceptance of the result, even from those who may disagree with it, and
    that can only follow from confidence in the care and attention given by
    the Tribunal making the decision.  It must be seen to  make  clear  and
    justifiable findings of fact, to direct itself correctly  on  the  law,
    and in a properly structured decision apply the law to the facts.

29. We make these comments because of the features  in  this  determination
    that we have identified.  This was an example, a rare example we  hope,
    of a determination which on its face gives reason to doubt the  system.
    It is right that it should be set aside so that a new decision  can  be
    made, one which will  show  that  all  factors  have  been  taken  into
    account, and in which confidence can therefore properly be placed.

Directions

30. We make the following directions.

31. The appeal is to be re-heard in  full  in  the  Upper  Tribunal.   Time
    estimate one day.  The hearing is to be on  the  first  available  date
    after two months from today.   The Tribunal hearing the  appeal  is  to
    consist of two judges, at least one of whom is to be a full time  judge
    of the upper Tribunal
