                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal with permission granted by the Upper  Tribunal  against
   a decision by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Archer.   The  appeal  was
   brought before the First-tier Tribunal against a decision to refuse leave
   to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant and against a decision to
   remove the appellant under section 47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
   Nationality Act 2006.  The appeal was dismissed insofar as  it  concerned
   the refusal of leave to remain and allowed to the limited extent that the
   decision to remove the appellant under section 47 was unlawful.

2) The appellant entered  the  UK  as  a  student  in  November  2011.   His
   application for an extension of his leave was refused on 21 February 2013
   because the appellant had not submitted an  original  bank  statement  as
   evidence that he satisfied the  relevant  maintenance  requirement.   The
   appellant submitted a bank statement in the form of a printout, described
   by the respondent as an "ad-hoc printout bank statement",  but  this  was
   not in the form required by the  Immigration  Rules.   According  to  the
   respondent, the appellant  had  to  show  that  he  had  ï¿½3,500  to  meet
   maintenance and course fees.

3) Before making the refusal decision the respondent wrote to the  appellant
   on 4  February  2013  requesting  that  an  original  bank  statement  be
   submitted but, according to the respondent, the appellant  failed  to  do
   this.  According to the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant's
   case was that he had not been contacted by the respondent to request  any
   missing documents.  The appeal was considered  by  the  judge  without  a
   hearing and, apart from the grounds of appeal,  there  was  no  statement
   from the appellant before the judge.  Accordingly the  judge  found  that
   there  was  no  evidence  that  the  appellant  had  not   received   the
   respondent's letter of 4 February 2013 requesting the bank  statement  in
   the proper form.  The respondent's letter  had  been  sent  to  the  same
   address as the refusal letter.   The judge found that the  appellant  had
   not provided a bank statement which complied with the requirements of the
   Immigration Rules.

4) In the application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  it  is
   contended that the appellant had sufficient funds for maintenance in  the
   State Bank of India but evidence of this was delayed in the post  on  the
   way from India.  It was acknowledged that the respondent had  written  to
   the appellant on 4 February requesting the original bank  statement.  The
   appellant posted this to  the  respondent  at  the  wrong  address.   The
   statement was sent to UKBA Croydon instead of the  address  in  Sheffield
   from which  the  respondent's  enquiry  had  emanated.   It  was  further
   submitted that a bundle had been sent to the Tribunal for the purpose  of
   the appeal and the judge was wrong not to have had regard  to  this.   It
   was pointed out that  there  is  an  exception  to  section  85A  of  the
   Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which would have allowed the
   judge to consider the bank statement in the correct format even though it
   was not submitted with the application.  In the determination  the  judge
   had failed to have regard to this provision.

5) Reliance was also placed upon a breach of the  appellant's  human  rights
   and on the principle of fairness.

6) Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it was arguable  there
   had been a procedural irregularity in that the appellant had  replied  to
   the respondent's letter of 4 February 2013 but had  posted  the  original
   bank statement to the wrong address.  In addition, it was  arguable  that
   the documents on which the appellant sought to rely had  not  been  taken
   into account by the judge.

7) At the hearing before us there was no appearance by or on behalf  of  the
   appellant.  We noted that the notice of hearing had been sent to the last
   known address for the  appellant.   There  was  no  explanation  for  the
   appellant's absence.  Having  regard  to  the  interests  of  justice  we
   decided to proceed with the hearing.

8) In  considering  this  appeal  we  noted  that  the  appellant  has  made
   differing assertions regarding his alleged failure to submit the original
   bank statement.  In his grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal,  he
   stated that he did not receive the letter of 4  February  2013  from  the
   respondent requesting the original bank  statement.   The  Judge  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal decided the appeal with regard to these grounds  but,
   because of the absence of evidence from the appellant, was not  satisfied
   that the appellant had not received the respondent's letter.

9) By the time the appellant was making his application  for  permission  to
   appeal to the Upper Tribunal, his position  had  changed.   According  to
   paragraph 5 of the application, the appellant sent off the original  bank
   statement but to the wrong address, as already noted, namely UKBA Croydon
   rather than the address in Sheffield given on the respondent's letter  of
   4 February 2013.  It  is  not  wholly  clear  from  paragraph  5  of  the
   application whether the appellant submitted the bank statement on his own
   initiative prior to 4 February 2013 or whether he was indeed replying  to
   the respondent's letter of that date.   In  paragraph  12,  however,  the
   appellant accepts that he received the letter dated 4 February  2013  but
   again states that he posted his bank statement  to  a  different  address
   from the address given on the respondent's letter.

10) It is possible that neither the original grounds of appeal to the First-
   tier Tribunal nor the application to the Upper Tribunal were  drafted  by
   the  appellant  personally,  although   no   representative   is   named.
   Nevertheless, the grounds of appeal and the application for permission to
   appeal contain conflicting statements about whether or not the  appellant
   received the respondent's letter of 4 February  2013  and  submitted  his
   original bank statement in response to it.  The appellant did not  appear
   before us to clarify these apparently contradictory assertions.  For  the
   purpose of the  hearing  before  us,  the  appellant  lodged  a  document
   described as a Witness Statement.  It is not signed or dated.  It repeats
   the appellant's assertion that he sent the  original  bank  statement  to
   Croydon instead of to Sheffield.  There  is  no  evidence  before  us  to
   suggest that this statement  was  before  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal or indeed that a bundle of documentary evidence was submitted by
   the appellant to which the Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to
   have regard.

11) On the basis of the evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  we  are
   satisfied that the judge was entitled  to  reach  the  decision  made  in
   respect of the bank statement, namely that the  original  bank  statement
   was not submitted by  the  appellant  in  response  to  the  respondent's
   request and that, accordingly, the appellant did not meet the maintenance
   requirements of the Immigration Rules.  It was submitted on behalf of the
   appellant that the judge wrongly sought  to  exclude  the  original  bank
   statement under section 85A of the 2002 Act.  Although the judge referred
   at some length to section 85A and, as already noted, did not mention  the
   exception for evidence adduced to show that  a  document  is  genuine  or
   valid, on which the  appellant  might  have  relied,  the  basis  of  the
   decision is that the appellant failed to provide a bank statement in  the
   correct form, not that a bank statement in the correct form was  provided
   too late to be taken into consideration.  Accordingly, the judge did  not
   fail to apply the provisions of section  85A  correctly  by  excluding  a
   document which ought to have been admitted.

12) It was further submitted on behalf of the appellant  that  the  decision
   did not take account of fairness and did not take proper account  of  his
   Article 8 rights.  We note that the judge referred  to  the  decision  in
   Thakur [2011] UKUT 00151 on the principle of fairness and by  implication
   concluded that the  decision  was  not  unfair.   We  see  no  reason  to
   interfere with this aspect of the judge's decision.  The judge went on to
   consider the appellant's right to private life but found that the refusal
   decision was not disproportionate.  The judge's reasoning in this  regard
   is adequate and we see no basis for finding any error or law in  relation
   to it.

13) In conclusion, if there is any inadequacy in the  judge's  decision,  it
   is that the judge's analysis of the effect of section 85A of the 2002 Act
   was incomplete but, having found that the required bank statement was not
   produced, the judge did not make an error of law in dismissing the appeal
   under the Immigration Rules.

Conclusions

14) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error on a point of law.

15) We do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

16) The First-tier Tribunal did not make a direction for  anonymity  and  we
   see no reason for making an order to that effect.
