For the Appellant:     Ms Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer
For  the  Respondent:     Mr  Balroop  of  counsel,  instructed  by   Hattin
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For many years, nationals of certain countries have been required, when
    applying for UK entry clearance, to demonstrate that they pose no  risk
    of bringing Tuberculosis ("TB") into this country.  This is  the  first
    case I have ever seen in which an applicant has  fallen  foul  of  that
    requirement, not only on application to the Entry Clearance Officer but
    also on appeal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Dijbouti who  was  born  on  16  December
    1980.  He appeals, with permission  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Martin, against a decision which  was  issued  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Adio ("the judge") on 14 April 2020.  The  judge's  decision  was
    reached on the papers at the request of both  parties.    He  dismissed
    the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's  refusal  of   his
    application for entry clearance as a spouse.  The  judge  made  various
    findings of fact in the appellant's favour.  He accepted that there was
    a genuine and subsisting relationship between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor.  He also accepted that she was earning a salary of  more  than
    �18,600 per annum and that the Financial Requirements of Appendix FM of
    the Immigration Rules were met.   He  also  found,  however,  that  the
    appellant had failed to provide a TB certificate; that he  consequently
    fell foul of the suitability requirement in S-EC 1.6(d); and  that  his
    ongoing exclusion  was  a  proportionate  course  for  Article  8  ECHR
    purposes.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 3. The grounds of  appeal  raise  a  single  point,  contending  that  the
    appellant was not required to produce a TB certificate because he lived
    in Egypt, which was not a country where TB screening is required by the
    UK.  This point had been made in the grounds of appeal to the  FtT  and
    evidence had been adduced in support of it.  The judge  had  failed  to
    take this into account.

 4. The respondent issued a  short  response  to  the  grounds  of  appeal,
    contending that the evidence before the judge was insufficient to  show
    that the appellant was exempt from the TB certificate requirement as he
    had provided untranslated copies of what was said  to  be  a  residence
    document for Egypt.  He was in Egypt on a temporary basis in any event.



 5.  More  detailed  written  submissions  were  made  by  the  appellant's
    solicitors on 16 November 2020.  The submission that the appellant  was
    exempt from the TB screening requirement was developed.   It  was  also
    submitted that  the  judge  had  conducted  an  incomplete  or  legally
    inadequate assessment of Article 8 ECHR.

Submissions

 6. Mr Balroop submitted initially that the appellant was  demonstrably  in
    Egypt at the time that he made the application for entry clearance  and
    that he was consequently not required to provide a TB certificate.   At
    my request, Ms Isherwood clarified the stance of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer as regards the construction  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   She
    submitted that the appellant was required to establish on  the  balance
    of probabilities that he  had  not  been  in  a  country  in  which  TB
    screening was required for at least six months.

 7. I asked Mr Balroop whether he accepted that Ms Isherwood's construction
    of the Rules would operate as a more effective curb on the risk  of  TB
    being brought into the UK.  I suggested to him  that  his  construction
    would enable a person from a country in which TB was rife to leave  the
    country temporarily to make an  entry  clearance  application,  thereby
    avoiding the disease-prevention measures in the Rules.  On  reflection,
    Mr Balroop accepted that Ms Isherwood's construction of the  Rules  was
    correct and that what he was required to establish was indeed that  the
    applicant had been in Egypt (and therefore had not  been  in  Dijbouti)
    for six months.  He accepted that the respondent's policy was  in  line
    with the Immigration Rules in this regard.

 8. The correct approach to the Immigration Rules having  been  agreed,  Mr
    Balroop turned to the evidence which was said to discharge  the  burden
    on the appellant.  In this respect, Mr Balroop was in  difficulty.   He
    had been instructed very recently and the papers provided to  him  gave
    no clear indication of what had or had not been before the judge.

 9. I considered the contents of the Tribunal's file with  Mr  Balroop.   I
    explained that it contained a short respondent's bundle and a bundle of
    documents which were appended to the notice of appeal to the First-tier
    Tribunal.  The respondent's bundle contains copies of  the  application
    for entry clearance, dated 31 May 2019, and  the  notices  of  decision
    from the ECO and the Entry Clearance Manager, dated 27 August 2019  and
    26 November 2019 respectively.  It also contains  a  Foreign  Residence
    Card from the Arab Republic of Egypt.  That document was issued  on  19
    September 2020 and expired on 23 March 2020.  The  translation  of  the
    document gives an address in Giza as the appellant's address.   I  note
    that the appellant  also  stated  in  his  application  form  that  his
    residential address is in Giza.  The Residence Category is said  to  be
    tourism, and the appellant confirmed in  his  online  application  form
    that he was not a permanent resident of Egypt.  The appellant stated in
    his application form that he  lived  legally  in  Egypt  and  that  his
    residence permit was to expire on 3 July 2019.

10. The Foreign Residence Card also appears  in  the  bundle  of  documents
    which were appended to the notice of appeal. There are other  documents
    in  that  bundle  which  bear  primarily  on  the  genuineness  of  the
    relationship  and  the  sponsor's  ability  to  satisfy  the  Financial
    Requirements of the Immigration Rules, although I  note  that  a  money
    remittance  record  from  Dahabshiil  shows  that  the  appellant  last
    received money in Somaliland from the sponsor in the UK on  15  January
    2019 and the application  form  states  that  they  lived  together  in
    Somaliland for 14 days ending on 3  May  2019.   There  were  no  other
    documents which bore on the appellant's stay in Egypt before the FtT.

11. Mr Balroop had  been  sent  additional  documents  by  his  instructing
    solicitors.  Since these did not appear  in  the  file,  and  since  Ms
    Isherwood had no objection, Mr Balroop sent them to the Upper  Tribunal
    by email.  The  first  document  is  a  flight  ticket  from  Ethiopian
    Airways.  The copy is very poor but it shows the appellant's name and a
    date of travel which appears to be 20 October 2018.  The flight, number
    ET452, was from ADD to CAI, which I know to represent Addis  Ababa  and
    Cairo.  The appellant was apparently  in  seat  23A  for  the  journey.
    Beyond those details, it is very  difficult  to  decipher  any  further
    information.  Then there is another document which was  issued  by  the
    Egyptian authorities.  Much of it is in Arabic but it states in English
    that it is a 'Temporary Residence Permit for Touristic Purposes',  with
    a period of stay given as '03/07/2019'.

12. Mr Balroop readily accepted that  there  was  no  proper  basis  for  a
    submission that these documents had  been  before  the  FtT.   He  also
    accepted my observation that the date which appears  at  the  top  left
    hand corner of each of these documents (3/4/2021) rather  militates  in
    favour of a suggestion that they were copied (or photographed)  on  the
    day before the hearing.

13. In the circumstances, Mr Balroop accepted that he was not able to  show
    that there was evidence before the FtT to show that the  appellant  had
    been resident in Egypt for six months.  He did not develop any  further
    submissions.

14. I was able to indicate that the appeal would be dismissed  for  reasons
    which would follow in writing.

Analysis

15. Paragraph A39 of the  Immigration  Rules  has  at  all  material  times
    provided as follows:

         Any person making an application for entry clearance to come to the
         UK for more than six months or as a  fianc�(e)  or  proposed  civil
         partner applying for leave  to  enter  under  Section  EC-P:  Entry
         clearance as a partner under Appendix FM, having been present in  a
         country listed in Appendix T for more than six  months  immediately
         prior  to  their  application,  must  present,  at  the   time   of
         application, a  valid  medical  certificate  issued  by  a  medical
         practitioner approved by the Secretary of State for these purposes,
         as  listed  on  the  Gov.uk  website,  confirming  that  they  have
         undergone screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis and that this
         tuberculosis is not present in the applicant.

16. Dijbouti is a country listed in Appendix T of the Immigration Rules, as
    is Somalia.  (Somaliland is  obviously  a  part  of  Somalia,  and  not
    recognised as a country in its own right.)  Egypt is not listed.  On  a
    page entitled 'Tuberculosis tests  for  visa  applicants',  the  gov.uk
    website contains a link to Appendix T and states that an applicant will
    not be required to have a TB test if, amongst other things:

         you lived for at least 6 months in a country where TB screening  is
         not required by the UK, and you've been away from that country  for
         no more than 6 months.

17. The respondent's decision made reference to the relevant provisions  of
    the Immigration Rules.  The grounds of appeal to the FtT made reference
    to the respondent's policy.  It was clearly submitted  in  the  grounds
    that the appellant was in  Egypt  and  that  he  was  exempt  from  the
    requirement to undergo a TB test.  It is not clear why the judge failed
    to deal with the assertion or the limited evidence  which  was  adduced
    before him in support of it.  Whatever the reason, it is apparent  that
    the judge erred in law in concluding simply that the appellant had  not
    produced a valid TB certificate; it was the appellant's  case  that  he
    was not required to  do  so  and  the  judge  failed  to  address  that
    argument.

18. As Mr Balroop came to recognise during the course of his realistic  and
    measured submissions, however, it is impossible to see how this failure
    on the part of the judge could be said to have  been  material  to  the
    outcome of the appeal.  I have taken some care to  set  out  above  the
    evidence which was and was  not  before  the  FtT.   Even  taking  that
    evidence at its highest, it falls short by some margin of  establishing
    that the appellant had 'lived for at least 6 months in a country  where
    TB  screening  is  not  required'.   Mr  Balroop  accepted   that   the
    respondent's policy accurately represented the test in the  Immigration
    Rules in expressing it in that way.  He was undoubtedly correct  to  do
    so, since the construction  which  he  initially  favoured  would  have
    create an undesirable and plainly unintended risk to public health  for
    the reasons I canvassed with him during his submissions (my  [7]  above
    refers).

19. The evidence shows that the appellant was in Somaliland at the start of
    2019.  He lived with the appellant  there  in  April  and  May  and  he
    collected money from Dahabshiil there in January that year.  If he flew
    from Addis Ababa to Cairo in October 2018, as appears to  be  the  case
    from the Ethiopian Airways ticket, he must have returned to  Somaliland
    at a later stage in 2018 or in early 2018.  He gave his address as Giza
    in his application for entry clearance in May 2019 and it is clear that
    he was permitted to be in Egypt for 'touristic purposes', firstly until
    July 2019 and then from 23 March 2020 to 19 September  2020.   None  of
    this evidence - even including the evidence which was  not  before  the
    FtT - shows that the appellant has ever spent a  continuous  period  of
    six months living in Egypt, whether before the decision of the ECO, the
    decision of the FtT or even  the  hearing  before  me.   Permission  to
    reside in a country does  not  establish  residence  pursuant  to  that
    permission, and it would be wrong to assume residence pursuant to  that
    permission where, as here, the individual in question  plainly  travels
    in and out of the country as a tourist.

20. There was never any proper evidential foundation for the assertion that
    the appellant was exempt from the requirement to  undergo  a  TB  test.
    The appellant was not required by the Rules to show that he had been to
    Egypt, or that he was entitled to go there  as  a  tourist.   What  was
    required was evidence that he had resided there  for  six  months,  and
    that evidence was absent before the FtT just as it is absent before me.
     The appellant could not have succeeded under the Immigration Rules.

21. The grounds of appeal made no challenge to the judge's consideration of
    Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules.  In  the  further  submissions  which
    were settled by the appellant's solicitors in November 2020, there were
    separate submissions advanced on this  basis.   It  was  submitted,  in
    summary,  that  the  judge  had  failed  to   undertake   an   adequate
    proportionality assessment in light of the matters he had  resolved  in
    the appellant's favour and, secondly, that the judge had overlooked the
    best interests of the child.

22. No application was made to amend the  grounds  of  appeal,  whether  in
    writing or by Mr Balroop.  Mr  Balroop  in  fact  made  no  attempt  to
    develop any submissions about Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules.  He was
    correct to adopt that stance, for the following reasons.

23. Firstly, there is no proper  basis  to  permit  the  amendment  to  the
    grounds of appeal.  It appears that the appellant's  solicitors  merely
    decided to attempt to add an additional ground of appeal,  without  any
    attempt to explain why it had not been pleaded  before.   I  note  that
    their submissions also post-dated the respondent's reply to the grounds
    of  appeal,  thereby  placing  the  respondent  at  a  disadvantage  in
    procedural terms.

24. Secondly, it is difficult to see how the dismissal  of  the  appeal  on
    Article 8 ECHR grounds did not follow inexorably  from  the  conclusion
    that the appellant had failed to show that he was free of a  dangerous,
    communicable, respiratory disease.  I note that the papers were  placed
    before the judge of the FtT on the first  day  of  the  first  Covid-19
    'lockdown', at which point the imperative of public  health  protection
    may not have been uppermost in his mind.  With the benefit of  all  the
    wisdom gained during 2020, it is not easy to see  what  could  be  more
    important (and therefore more proportionate) than securing  the  health
    of the United Kingdom by excluding those who might  be  suffering  from
    communicable diseases.

25. Thirdly, insofar as it is said  that  the  judge  overlooked  the  best
    interests of the child, there was no adequate evidence to show that the
    decision under appeal had any impact on the best interests of a  child.
    The only mention of a child I have been able to find in the  papers  is
    at part 1.28 of the Appendix 2 form.   The  preceding  question,  "Does
    your sponsor have any children?" is answered in the affirmative but the
    name, nationality and date of birth of the child  is  left  blank.   At
    1.28, it is said that the sponsor  is  responsible  financially  for  a
    child who was born on 18 November 2014.  There is no further  reference
    to this child, or to his parentage, in any of the other evidence.

26. In the circumstances, although he reached the conclusion by  the  wrong
    route, the judge was correct to conclude that the appellant  could  not
    meet the Immigration Rules.  There  was  no  application  to  vary  the
    grounds to include a challenge to his Article 8 ECHR conclusions.   Had
    there been any such variation, I would  have  rejected  the  ground  of
    appeal for the reasons immediately above.

27. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
