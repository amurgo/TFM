                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead  to  contempt  of  court  proceedings.   This
direction applies because of the sensitive nature of the claim.

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Cuba  born  on  27th  June  1965  and  he
    appeals against the decision of the Secretary of State dated 14th March
    2019 refusing his asylum,  humanitarian  protection  and  human  rights
    claim under the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  ("ECHR").   He
    entered the United Kingdom on 5th May 2007 and claimed asylum which was
    refused, and his appeal was dismissed on 25th September 2007.  On  10th
    October 2017, HGV submitted further representations asserting  that  he
    no longer had the right to enter Cuba and as a result was stateless and
    a refugee.  The  respondent  considered  the  further  submissions  but
    refused his claims with an in country right of appeal.   The  appellant
    appealed under Section 82(1)(a) and (b) of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.

 2. His appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge N  M  K  Lawrence  who
    dismissed his appeal on 1st July  2019  (without  making  an  anonymity
    direction).  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set  aside  by
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge O'Ryan on 6th January  2020  on  the  basis
    that the judge had materially  erred  in  law  by  proceeding  under  a
    mistake of fact as  to  the  appellant's  oral  evidence,  specifically
    whether his relatives in Cuba would afford him any support on return to
    Cuba, and which was relevant to the issue of what avenues  may  or  may
    not be available to the appellant  to  seek  repatriation  to  Cuba  by
    obtaining sponsorship.  Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge O'Ryan  also  found
    that the respondent  had  taken  no  issue  at  any  stage  as  to  the
    reliability of any of the  documentation  that  were  provided  by  the
    appellant and said to emanate from the Cuban  Embassy  and,  therefore,
    the judge proceeded unfairly by treating a number  of  those  documents
    with significant caution, and thereby placing limited  weight  on  them
    for reasons which were not raised with the appellant in the hearing and
    which were only raised by  the  judge  in  his  written  decision.  The
    decision was set aside in its entirety and no  findings  of  fact  were
    preserved.

 3. The appeal came before us at a resumed 'face  to  face  hearing'.   The
    appellant appeared in person to adopt his written statement but was not
    called to give live evidence.  The appellant's representative confirmed
    that he did not require an interpreter.

 4. The appellant has twice previously had his international protection and
    ECHR claim considered,  first  by  Immigration  Judge  Chohan  on  24th
    September 2007 who dismissed the claim on all grounds, and secondly  by
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Telford  on  14th  October  2013  who  also
    dismissed the claims.

 5. Before First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan the appellant explained that he
    was a professional engineer and had a degree  in  gas  engineering  and
    that his  problems  began  in  Cuba  when  he  spoke  out  against  the
    authorities at his place of work; as a  result,  he  was  perceived  as
    being anti-government.  He stated, however, that he was never  detained
    nor ill-treated whilst in Cuba but would meet with  private  groups  to
    speak out against the regime in Cuba.  He did not wish to be  a  member
    of the Communist Party but was forced to attend meetings, otherwise  he
    would face punishment.  He claimed that his name was on a  list  as  an
    opponent of the regime and that he was denied an opportunity to advance
    his career.  He also wove a complicated web of travel  suggesting  that
    he had travelled to Russia, then Europe and on to  Mexico,  only  being
    returned to the United Kingdom where he had transited.  In evidence  he
    stated that in fact he had never been detained in Cuba but that  if  he
    were returned to Cuba, he would be considered  a  deserter  as  he  had
    rejected the Communist regime and would face imprisonment for a  period
    of four to five years including torture.  He  gave  evidence  that  all
    along he had been intending to go to America and the only way he  could
    get a visa was to go  to  Russia.   Judge  Chohan  made  the  following
    findings [with our underlining]:

         "It is quite clear from the reasons for  refusal  letter  that  the
         Appellant's credibility as a whole is not challenged.  However,  it
         is the Respondent's position that the Appellant faces no real  risk
         of persecution upon return to Cuba.  It is  the  Appellant's  claim
         that he has a degree in gas  engineering  and  was  employed  by  a
         company in Cuba.  The Appellant claims that he  spoke  out  against
         the Communist regime in Cuba and was involved  in  holding  private
         meetings with groups of four to five people.   It  is  further  the
         Appellant's claim that he did not wish to  attend  Communist  Party
         meetings but he was placed under pressure from the authorities  and
         in particular a committee called the CDR to attend meetings.  As  a
         result, the Appellant claims that he was  considered  to  be  anti-
         government.  I have no reason to disbelieve the Appellant's account
         but there is nothing to suggest that he has ever been persecuted or
         ill-treated or will be if returned to Cuba.  There is no doubt that
         the Appellant is disillusioned with the political  system  in  Cuba
         and it is apparent from his account that he does feel  that  he  is
         not valued as a professional individual.  The Appellant  has  never
         been arrested or detained by the authorities.  I do  find  that  if
         the Cuban authorities had  any  serious  adverse  interest  in  the
         Appellant then no doubt he would have been arrested and detained at
         some point.  Indeed, the Appellant was able to  obtain  a  visa  to
         travel to Russia although it is the Appellant's  argument  that  he
         was allowed to  do  so  because  Russia  is  a  Communist  country.
         Nevertheless, the Appellant travelled on his own  passport  without
         any difficulties from the Cuban authorities.  I  do  find  that  if
         they had any adverse interest in  him  then  they  would  not  have
         allowed him to leave the country".

 6. The judge noted that in practice the Cuban  government's  human  rights
    record remained poor and the government did not allow criticism of  the
    'Revolution' or its leaders.   The  judge  recorded  that  the  country
    report  on  Cuba  at  that  time  stated  that  "disseminating   'enemy
    propaganda', which included expressing opinions at odds with  those  of
    the government, was punishable by up to fourteen years'  imprisonment".
    That said, the judge found again at paragraph 17 of his determination:

         "There is nothing in the Appellant's account to suggest that he was
         ever persecuted or ill-treated.  Indeed, by his own account he  was
         never arrested or detained by the authorities.  The  Appellant  may
         well have faced  some  pressure  from  the  authorities  to  attend
         Communist Party meetings but other  than  that  he  experienced  no
         difficulties".

 7. In essence, the judge at paragraph 18 found:

         "In short, the Appellant travelled through  several  countries  and
         remained in one for over a year but did not  claim  asylum.   Those
         are not the actions of a genuine asylum seeker.  There is no  doubt
         in my mind that the Appellant is simply seeking  a  better  way  of
         life. ... [it] does not amount to persecution or ill treatment".

 8. The judge found he may be questioned regarding his departure but  there
    was no evidence that he would  be  persecuted  or  ill-treated  by  the
    authorities.

 9. On 14th October 2013 First-tier Tribunal Judge Telford  again  rejected
    the appellant's asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights appeal
    and found no risk to the appellant  owing  to  his  actual  or  imputed
    political activity in or outside Cuba.  Judge Telford  noted  that  the
    country guidance case law OM (Cuba  returning  dissident)  Cuba  [2004]
    UKAIT 00120, had been amended since Judge Chohan's decision (OM had not
    in fact been mentioned), but that the relevant country guidance was, by
    2013, to be found in  Fernandez  (Dissidents  and  defectors)  Cuba  CG
    [2011] UKUT 00343 (IAC).  The judge recorded at paragraph 5 that:

         "Counsel for  the  appellant  helpfully  stated  that  it  was  the
         appellant's case that the factual findings were accepted as per the
         determination and it was submitted by both parties that essentially
         there  was  no  dispute  over  the   facts   as   found   in   that
         determination".

10.  Nonetheless,  the  judge   detailed   that   although   the   previous
    determination was a starting point "it was not set  in  stone  that  it
    would be the same end point or that if it were, the same route would be
    travelled in getting there".  In particular, the  judge  detailed  that
    the appellant's claim was that now he had been absent from Cuba for six
    years and this period was in excess of the two  years  permitted  under
    the Cuban regime for their citizens.  The  appellant  asserted  he  had
    heard from his relatives who had been visited by the police or security
    in Cuba and his brother was now jailed.  The appellant had letters from
    the Cuban Embassy in the UK to confirm loss of his status in Cuba, [7].

11. The judge noted the documentary and other evidence  and  in  particular
    that an "expert country report by ARC"  had  been  provided,   a  study
    dated 19th February 2013  by  the  Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  of
    Canada, Cuba: Treatment by authorities of  failed  asylum  seekers  who
    have returned to Cuba, including the treatment of family  members  that
    remained in Cuba.

12. The judge's finding included the following at paragraph 19:

         "I found the appellant's core account of being  a  person  who  was
         unable to return to Cuba permanently and as  a  citizen  with  such
         rights of residence credible simply as he has no documentation  and
         had left Cuba for more than the 24 months permitted.  However  that
         does not mean he could not apply to return".

    A letter produced from the Cuban Embassy showed that the appellant  had
    been considered by  the  "Cuban  authorities  now  to  be  a  permanent
    resident of the UK".  He had left Cuba on 26th April 2007 with a permit
    from the Cuban government to travel to the UK but to return before 26th
    April 2008.  "He was therefore only entitled to travel  to  Cuba  as  a
    temporary visitor for up to 90 days (provided  he  had  a  valid  Cuban
    passport with an entry permit (habitation) and a visa for two years  or
    more from the UK where he resides)".

13. The judge proceeded as follows:

         "However, I do not find him credible in his core account of leaving
         his country for Russia as an asylum seeker in fear  of  persecution
         due to anti-regime political activity and having  travelled  around
         other European countries before arriving in the UK illegally.  This
         is because that is completely at odds with what the letter from the
         embassy clearly states that when he left Cuba on 26th  April  2007,
         he did so to travel direct to the UK  for  personal  reasons  on  a
         Cuban visa or permit".

    It was observed that evidence was inconsistent with the evidence before
    Judge Chohan and the judge found that the appellant would not have  had
    a permit to travel abroad to anywhere at  that  time  without  being  a
    person whom the Cuban authorities at that time could trust and thus was
    not in fear in persecution.

14. Further, the judge found that there was no  evidence,  other  than  the
    appellant's word, that his brother was in prison or his family had been
    visited and he would not have expected the appellant to have  contacted
    the family by telephone either directly at their home in Cuba or direct
    to the Cuban Embassy here in London.  The judge proceeded  to  find  as
    follows at paragraph 22:

         "This case to me turns on the way he puts his  case  in  regard  to
         what is stated in Fernandez at paragraph 57.  The  appellant  would
         of course return to a land where basic civil and  political  rights
         as we in the UK legally deem them are  denied  their  citizens  and
         where human rights are generally not respected by the state when it
         comes to dissidents.  Those who may be deemed dissidents are anyone
         who are regarded by the state of Cuba  as  engaging  in  activities
         contrary  to  its  political  agenda  and  engage  in  unauthorised
         opposition to the state political agenda.  However, we already know
         and Mr Chohan has found, that the appellant is not to  be  regarded
         as a dissident - either in  terms  of  the  guidance  under  OM  or
         Fernandez today as I find.  He is not a person whom  the  state  in
         Cuba has found unable to trust from his life in Cuba as they  would
         not have issued him with a direct visa to  the  UK  on  26th  April
         2007".

15. At paragraph 24 the judge found:

         "I am not satisfied even on the low  standard  that  a  person  who
         simply does not return is to be regarded  necessarily  or  in  this
         case as openly disloyal.  It was submitted quite skilfully with the
         limited material available that his conduct has put in the category
         or persons who would be or could be seen as disloyal.  That conduct
         is one of a person skilled and highly educated as  not  registered.
         I do not find that  the  regime  necessarily  knows  he  wished  to
         ultimately arrive in the USA.  There is no evidence  they  know  of
         this at all.  I do not find that  a  person  who  is  educated  has
         necessarily a higher chance of being considered a dissident  simply
         because they are higher educated".

16. With respect to the ARC Report the judge found it lacked any  finalised
    conclusion on the questions asked, and the judge had no way of  knowing
    if all the possible evidence with regard to  the  questions  asked  was
    considered or addressed or simply provided  information  as  "pointers"
    and thus the ARC Report was viewed as not entirely a reasoned  argument
    on  all the evidence.

17. Although the report was said to be of somewhat limited use,  the  judge
    stated at paragraph 29:

         "Question 5 appeared to be  answered  in  an  inconclusive  manner.
         Whilst it dealt with persons who had been  abroad  only  up  to  24
         months, that was not the case for the  appellant.   What  that  did
         point out and which the appellant relied on pari passu was that  if
         a person has not only applied for asylum and been  refused  it  but
         that they are known by the authorities to have  done  so  they  may
         sometimes  be  unable  to  access  full   services   and   may   be
         'blacklisted' and face difficulties for  employment  ...  Certainly
         there  was  no  evidence  before  me  that  he  was  known  by  the
         authorities in Cuba as a failed asylum seeker.  I find that  he  is
         not likely to inform them as such".

18. The judge went on to find that the appellant had  expressed  consistent
    and credible worry but that his concerns were misplaced and that he had
    not been "entirely credible in terms of when he left,  what  permission
    he  had  and  what  destination  he  had".   The  judge  found  he  had
    "overcooked" his case in terms of being only able to leave for  Russia,
    and the embassy evidence now undermined that account, such that he  was
    not found to be seen by the authorities from his  behaviour,  over  the
    years many years in Cuba, as a dissident or troublemaker or as a person
    who disagreed with the authorities and "even his criminal record  would
    have been known by the authorities and yet they  gave  him  a  visa  to
    leave for one month in 2007 direct to the UK.  They would not have done
    this if his account of being a political opponent were true".

    Documentation before the Upper Tribunal

19. For the resumed  hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the  appellant
    produced a bundle of evidence, A1 to A4, B1 to B4 and  C1  to  C98.   A
    supplementary bundle was produced, pages 1 to 186.  We  considered  all
    the material submitted.

20. The respondent  produced  a  two  page  skeleton  argument  dated  11th
    February 2020 and Mr Fripp produced an amended skeleton argument  dated
    December 2020, for reconsideration.

21. At the hearing the appellant adopted his statement of  8th  March  2020
    and was content as was his representative Mr Fripp  that  his  evidence
    was sufficient to understand the proceedings without an interpreter.

    Submissions

22. Mr Fripp told us that the appellant in 2014 filed  an  application  for
    leave to remain as a stateless person,  the  core  of  his  application
    being that the treatment he received was indicative of him, in reality,
    being stateless in the sense required by the Immigration Rules, HC  395
    but that application was refused on  14th  December  2015  because  the
    respondent viewed the appellant as remaining a Cuban citizen, albeit he
    faced obstacles to return.  The respondent argued  that  the  appellant
    could seek a "special permit" if there was any chance, he might  regain
    residency in Cuba and  he  was  a  Cuban  national  and  therefore  not
    stateless.   At the hearing before us Mr Fripp confirmed  that  it  was
    not being  argued  that  the  appellant  was  stateless  but  that  the
    treatment by the Cuban authorities in relation to the obstacles to  his
    return amounted to serious harm  because  of  the  deprivation  of  his
    rights.  The claimant would be seen as disloyal.  This in turn  founded
    the protection claim.  In support of his claim expert evidence was  put
    forward as well as evidence from the Cuban Embassy which had repeatedly
    confirmed that the appellant was a  citizen  of  Cuba  but  there  were
    obstacles to his return.  'Emigrado' status had been inflicted upon him
    entailing a loss of residency, loss of property and loss  of  right  to
    enter or to remain.

23. One of the primary tenets of international law was that the state  must
    admit its nationals when they  are  excluded  or  expelled  by  another
    state.  Article 13(2) of the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights
    provided that 'Everyone has the right to leave any  country,  including
    his own, and to return' and the International  Covenant  on  Civil  and
    Political Rights  1966  ("ICCPR"),  as  approved  by  UNHCR,  prohibits
    arbitrary exclusion, although Cuba is not a party  to  the  ICCPR.   Mr
    Fripp in his skeleton argument  also  referred  to  the  Inter-American
    Commission on Human Rights which concluded that the  position  on  Cuba
    towards restrictions on the rights  of  its  nationals'  residence  and
    movement represented a 'permanent  situation  of  violation'  of  those
    rights. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ("IACHR")  report
    of 2018 again confirmed that the restrictions on residence and movement
    were an impediment to and  improper  interference  with  its  citizen's
    rights and the IACHR report of 2020 confirmed that the impossibility of
    returning to one's own country prevented Cubans from enjoying effective
    nationality tantamount to persecution.  We  were  also  referred  to  a
    decision of the Refugee Appeal Division of the immigration and  Refugee
    Board  of  Canada  which  declared  that  Cuban's  policy  founded   an
    entitlement to refugee status.  We did point out to Mr Fripp that  this
    was  a  first  instance  Canadian  decision  from  a  court   with   no
    jurisdiction in English law.

24. We were referred to relevant sections of the Refugee Convention and the
    Qualification Directive. Mr Fripp also referred to Gashi and Nikshiqi v
    SSHD [1997] INLR 96 where the court (the  Immigration Appeal  Tribunal)
    largely  accepted  the  definition  of  Professor   J   Hathaway   that
    'persecution is most appropriately defined as the sustained or systemic
    failure of state protection in relation to one of the core entitlements
    which  has  been  recognised  by  the  international  community'.    He
    advanced that the House of Lords had endorsed this approach in  Horvath
    v SSHD [2000] UKHL 37, Sepet v SSHD [2003] UKHL  15  and  R  (Ullah)  v
    Special Adjudicator [2004] UKHL 26.

25. We were also referred to EB (Ethiopia) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 809 which
    decisively confirmed that arbitrary  deprivation  of  key  elements  of
    nationality would, in appropriate circumstances, amount to persecution.



26. MA (Ethiopia) [2009] EWCA 289 at paragraph 43 was relevant, as although
    the appeal here related to  deprivation  of  residency  and  associated
    rights, the deprivation of nationality was  analogous.   The  Court  of
    Appeal, in MA (Ethiopia), broadly  reiterated  EB  (Ethiopia)  and  was
    concerned with the means of gaining entry to the  country.  In  a  case
    where the ability to access the index country was a central part of the
    factual matrix it should be addressed.   The  Court  of  Appeal  in  MA
    (Ethiopia) identified that the  Tribunal,  however,  erred  by  eliding
    consideration of risk on the basis of contemplated presence in Ethiopia
    with consideration of whether there arose a  bar  to  return  precisely
    because of persecutory deprivation of rights relating  to  nationality.
    Where the right to return  was  part  of  the  persecution  itself  the
    Tribunal should engage with that question.  Further merely because  the
    appellant wished to remain in the United Kingdom  did  not  render  the
    refusal of access/rights by Cuba devoid of persecutory treatment.   Nor
    did the fact that Cuba acted in conformity  with  its  own  state  laws
    prevent its actions from being persecutory.   Mr Fripp relied on Danian
    v SSHD [1999] EWCA Civ 3000 and YB (Eritrea) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 360
    such that 'good faith' in sur place activities was  irrelevant  to  the
    question of entitlement to protection.

27. The appellant here was prevented  from  accessing  Cuba  through  means
    which  were  persecutory.  We  were  referred  to  the  official  Cuban
    documentation within the bundle and the references to Cuban  law.   The
    Communist Party of Cuba was  the  sole  political  party  permitted  to
    operate in Cuba and the dominant political power. Since the early years
    of rule, Cuba had required its  citizens  to  apply  for  and  maintain
    permission  to  leave  or  remain   outside   the   country   otherwise
    criminalising presence outside its territory.  In addition, Cubans  who
    remained outside Cuba without permission beyond a period  of  permitted
    absence, were termed "emigrados" and forfeited authorisation to return.
    Since the initial documentation from the Cuban Embassy on 27th May 2011
    the law had changed.  There was a liberalisation in  the  law  in  2013
    such that it was possible to repatriate but because the property of  an
    "emgirado" would have been confiscated by the State, a deed of  support
    is required for residence.

28.  The  correspondence  between  the  appellant  and  the  Cuban  Embassy
    confirmed that the appellant needed to apply though the Embassy with an
    affidavit of support.    That  was  a  prerequisite.   His  family  had
    confirmed that they did not wish to do so as demonstrated at C47 and  C
    48 of the bundle.    Correspondence from the Cuban Embassy in  relation
    to the appellant was submitted and the final  statement  of  the  Cuban
    Embassy dated 4th April 2019 from Lidice Vegueria Lopez, the councillor
    at the embassy in charge of  consular  affairs,  dated  27th  May  2011
    (could be located at C87 of the bundle which) again  repeated  that  to
    make an application the appellant must have an affidavit of support and
    evidence that he had leave to remain in the UK.

29. We were also referred to the Austrian Red  Cross  Accord  Report  dated
    August 2017 "Accord" report at H33.

30. The Cuban authorities now knew that the appellant was a  failed  asylum
    seeker in the UK because this information had been passed to the  Cuban
    Embassy when the appellant was seeking information on  the  formalities
    of his return. He had been outside Cuba for  13  years  and  he  had  a
    history that would have been recorded.  He had not  been  true  to  the
    expectations of the party  by  'repaying'  his  advanced  education  in
    working for the state.

31. The appellant was denied the ability to return and exercise his  rights
    as a citizen by reason of the application of unusual  laws  which  were
    politically motivated to punish dissenting behaviour, that is  not  co-
    operating with the Communist party of  Cuba.    The  appellant  had  no
    proof of legal residence in the UK and no proof of  support  and  could
    not get a decision from the authorities in Havana and  because  of  the
    operation of the legal scheme for re-entry  and  residence.   That  was
    persecutory for a convention reason and Contrary to Article 9(1)(a) and
    (b) of the Qualification Directive.

32. The experts, Mr Alpizar and Ms Diversent, who provided written  reports
    on behalf of HGV, were both qualified lawyers and the report reiterated
    the legal provisions of Cuba.

33. Albeit the appellant's  appeals  had  been  previously  dismissed,  the
    tribunal decisions, showed substantial acceptance  of  the  appellant's
    history prior to departure from Cuba and both tribunals  were  entirely
    concerned with how the appellant might be treated on return and assumed
    an ability to return. Neither tribunal had detailed  specific  evidence
    as to how refusal to participate in Communist  Party  of  Cuba  ("CPC")
    organs or unauthorised remaining outside the country would be seen,  as
    now provided in the reports from Mr Alpizar and  Ms  Diversent.   Those
    reports  supplemented  already  strong  findings  in  Fernandez,  which
    confirmed that the Cuban authorities are  intolerant  of  any  form  of
    unauthorised opposition to its political agenda and the law is used  to
    criminalise dissent and that engaging in  activities  regarded  by  the
    authorities as contrary to its political agenda even without membership
    in  any  organised  group  can  give  rise  to  characterisation  as  a
    dissident.

34. The effect of  withdrawal  of  the  right  to  return  in  relation  to
    international law was not raised in  2007  nor  2013  and  no  previous
    appeal hearing had  been  addressed  on  this  or  shown  the  relevant
    material in relation to deprivation of ability to  return  and  asylum.
    In this respect, past decisions did not  come  with  the  principle  of
    Devaseelan v SSHD [2002] UKIAT 00702.  The decisions of the respondent,
    however, retained some relevance on this point.

35. The respondent's decision of  14th  December  2015  accepted  that  the
    appellant was

         "potentially not admissible to Cuba however you do still hold Cuban
         citizenship" and that the appellant "would  have  to  apply  for  a
         special permit to return to Cuba be it for temporary visit  purpose
         or to resume residence"

    and that he

         "would not be allowed to return to Cuba without an endorsement  ...
         by the  Cuban  diplomatic  mission  abroad,  which  in  most  cases
         requires approval from the authorities in Cuba".

    The decision of 14th March  2019  presently  under  appeal  erroneously
    stated that the appellant was previously found to be able to repatriate
    himself and that being stateless was not a Convention reason  and  that
    he would not be at significant harm on return to Cuba.

36. Ultimately the case raised a single issue which is the  effect  of  the
    appellant's current position vis a vis the  Cuban  authorities  and  in
    particular whether he was today left unable or unwilling to  return  to
    Cuba by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution.

37. Applying EB (Ethiopia) and MA (Ethiopia) it could be shown, first, that
    the appellant is prevented from return by  well-documented  Cuban  laws
    which punish those who had overstayed their  permission  to  leave  and
    remain  outside  Cuba.   Secondly,  those  legal  provisions   are   of
    longstanding application and remained in effect.

38. Thirdly, there was  a  consistent  history  of  the  Cuban  authorities
    applying those rules to deny right of return and this  is  attested  by
    the documents from the Cuban authorities themselves.

39. Fourthly, the 'emigrado' provisions  breach  the  strong  international
    legal norms of protection for the right of individuals  to  re-enter  a
    country.

40. Fifthly, the expert and objective evidence confirmed Cuba's application
    of these politicised measures to the appellant was in material part  by
    reason of his actual or  attributed  anti-Communist  political  opinion
    and/or social  group  (emigrado/exile).   The  Tribunal's  own  country
    guidance in Fernandez (Dissidents and defectors) Cuba CG confirmed that



         "the  authorities  are  intolerant  of  any  form  of  unauthorised
         opposition  to  its  political  agenda  and  the  law  is  used  to
         criminalise dissent" (CG headnote (ii)).

     On a balanced assessment it is clear that the appellant  had  held  an
    anti-Communist or anti-CPC beliefs at the relevant times and  displayed
    this in Cuba by refusal to participate in CPC dominated structures  and
    again by seeking to depart Cuba permanently and claiming asylum.

41. Sixthly, even  without  his  actual  manifestation  of  his  views  the
    'emigrado' provisions effectively deemed those  overstaying  permission
    to be outside  Cuba  as  dissidents  from  CPC  rule.   The  'emigrado'
    measures themselves were  political  and  served  to  mark  and  punish
    disloyalty.  The previous Tribunals in each case concluded there  would
    be no persecution on return.  The phrase 'economic migrant' applied  to
    the appellant failed to appreciate that in the context of which  Cuba's
    poverty was closely linked to the political rule by the  CPC,  and  the
    desire to leave, highlighted that poverty and was in effect  political.



42. Seventh, the position of the Cuban authorities on the critical issue of
    exclusion was clear and that was evidenced by the  first  statement  of
    the Cuban Embassy.

43. Eighth, the Upper Tribunal  had,  contrary  to  the  previous  decision
    makers,  abundant  objective   evidence   concerning   the   'emigrado'
    provisions and further, the expert evidence  from  Mr  Alpizar  and  Ms
    Diversent both of whom clearly identified  the  politicised  nature  of
    Cuban laws restricting the freedom of movement and,  the  arbitrariness
    with which applications for permission to return are addressed both  in
    general and with regard to the instant case.

44. Ninth, an application had in any event been made to the relevant  Cuban
    authorities and Mr Lopez had in April 2019 made clear  that  to  return
    the appellant would have to prove UK residence valid for two  years  or
    more. It was clear that  the  appellant  could  not  comply  with  this
    requirement.  That was in essence a cover for arbitrary exclusion,  and
    nothing had changed on the  facts  since  that  assessment.   The  mere
    provision for an application to be made for a short period of temporary
    return, withholding the substance of Article 12(4) did not  remove  the
    glaring breach of international  standards  represented  by  the  Cuban
    'emigrado' law or the satisfaction of the refugee definition.







    The Secretary of State's submissions

45. The respondent's  written  submissions  were  set  out  in  a  skeleton
    argument submitted on 11th February 2020 and  in  turn  relied  on  the
    Secretary of State's refusal of the appellant's  claim  on  14th  March
    2019.  Reliance was also placed on the two previous tribunal  decisions
    with reference to Devaseelan.  The respondent  relied  on  the  Country
    Policy and Information Response of September 2017 which appeared to  be
    the most recent document in the respondent's  library  of  Country  and
    Policy Information documents relating to Cuba.   The  officer  drafting
    the grounds could not locate by electronic means the  evidence  adduced
    by the appellant at the hearing of November 2019 and noted the

         "officer drafting this  skeleton  is  reliant  on  the  information
         stored in R's computer systems which are not producing much by  way
         of assistance to him or the Tribunal".

46. At the outset of the hearing, we confirmed with Ms Cunha the  facts  in
    dispute and she focussed on the ability and the effect on the appellant
    to be able to return.  As set out in her oral submissions  it  was  the
    Secretary of State's case that the appellant could make an  application
    for return, albeit temporary.

47. Ms Cunha  submitted  that  the  Accord  Report  demonstrated  that  the
    appellant could  return  to  Cuba  under  Cuban  law,  but  this  would
    initially be on a visit visa basis and thereafter the  appellant  could
    apply for permanent residency.  In the meantime, she accepted he  would
    not be able to access employment,  accommodation,  pension  rights  and
    healthcare.  She could not help us on  the  length  of  time  that  she
    thought the appellant might have to  endure  the  inability  to  access
    social and economic assistance and she acknowledged that the family had
    denied that it could offer support.  That was not challenged.

48. She submitted there was a nexus between not being able to access rights
    on the basis of  being  an  emigrado  and  government  procedures,  but
    submitted that, neither on its own nor cumulatively, was sufficient  to
    amount to imputed political opinion and could not afford protection  to
    this appellant under the Refugee Convention.  There was no  pattern  of
    mistreatment.   She  accepted  that  the  Cuban  government  adopted  a
    position  which  had  a  discriminatory   effect,   and   which   could
    cumulatively amount to serious harm  but  that  the  approach  was  not
    consistently applied to a class of persons and thus the appellant could
    not fall within such a class.  This was not a case where the government
    actively pursued someone seen as a political dissident such as a  draft
    evader.   There  was  a  distinction  between  a  government   actively
    implementing a  policy  which  would  lead  to  persecution  over,  for
    example, past activity and a government on the other hand just applying
    rules to all those  who  departed  and  within  those  rules  having  a
    discretion to re-admit those who had  left.   There  was  a  difference
    between prosecuting someone and deciding  that  they  would  on  return
    would not be able to avail themselves of protection.

49. In response, Mr Fripp made  clear  that  his  case  was  not  based  on
    statelessness but on the deprivation of the essential  rights  attached
    to the appellant's Cuban  citizenship  and  the  consequences  of  that
    deprivation which amounted, according to Mr Fripp, to such a  violation
    that it  constituted  serious  harm.   He  added  the  deprivation  was
    politically motivated.

Analysis

50. Article 1A(2) of the Refugee  Convention  relating  to  the  Status  of
    Refugees 1951 provides the definition of refugee as:

         '2(c) 'refugee' means a third country national who, owing to a well
         founded fear of being persecuted for  reasons  of  race,  religion,
         nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social
         group, is outside the country of  nationality  and  is  unable  or,
         owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the
         protection of that country'.

51. In Lazarevic v SSHD [1997]  EWCA  Civ  1007  Hutchison  LJ  held,  that
    refusal to permit return (depending  on  a  convention  reason),  might
    constitute persecution and held as follows:

         'If a State arbitrarily  excludes  one  of  its  citizens,  thereby
         cutting him off from enjoyment of all  those  benefits  and  rights
         enjoyed by citizens and duties owed by a  State  to  its  citizens,
         there is in my view no difficulty in accepting  that  such  conduct
         can amount to persecution. Such a person may properly say both that
         he is being persecuted and that he fears [continued] persecution in
         the future. I see no reason, given the scope  and  objects  of  the
         Convention, not to accept Professor Hathaway's formulation;  and  I
         am encouraged to do so by the fact that Simon Brown L.J.  cited  it
         in terms which at least implied approval in Ravichandran [1996] Imm
         AR 97 at 107. However, even accepting that refusal to permit return
         can constitute persecution for a Convention  reason,  I  would  not
         myself accept that that would be so in the case of those who,  like
         these appellants, are anxious at all costs not to return:  how  can
         they be said to be harmed by such a refusal? I shall return to this
         in the context of the second of the questions raised by Mr. Lewis's
         submissions, to which I now turn'.

52. Under Regulation 5 of the Refugee or Person in  Need  of  International
    Protection (Qualification) Regulations 2006, as far as  relevant,  acts
    of persecution are defined as follows:

         5  (1)   In deciding whether a  person  is  a  refugee  an  act  of
         persecution must be:

              (a)      sufficiently serious by its nature or repetition as
              to constitute a severe violation of a basic human right, in
              particular a right from which derogation cannot be made under
              Article 15 of the Convention for the Protection of Human
              Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; or

              (b)      an accumulation of various measures, including a
              violation of a human right which is sufficiently severe as to
              affect an individual in a similar manner as specified in (a).

           (2)   An act of persecution may, for example, take the form of:

              (a)      an act of physical or mental violence, including an
              act of sexual violence;

              (b)      a legal, administrative, police, or judicial measure
              which in itself is discriminatory or which is implemented in
              a discriminatory manner;

              (c)      prosecution or punishment, which is disproportionate
              or discriminatory;

              (d)      denial of judicial redress resulting in a
              disproportionate or discriminatory punishment;

              ...

           (3)   An act of persecution must be committed for at  least  one
           of the reasons in Article 1(A) of the Geneva Convention

53.  The  headnote  to  the  Cuban  country  guidance  case  of   Fernandez
    (Dissidents and defectors) Cuba CG [2011] UKUT 00343 (IAC) reads,  with
    our underling for emphasis, as follows:

         "(i)     The human rights situation  in  Cuba  is  dismal  and  the
            government continues to  deny  its  citizens  basic  civil  and
            political rights.

         (ii)     The authorities are intolerant of any form of unauthorised
            opposition to its political agenda  and  the  law  is  used  to
            criminalise dissent.

         (iii)    The term 'dissident' in the context of Cuba does not refer
            to a homogenous  group  of  people  but  can  refer  to  anyone
            engaging in activities regarded by the authorities as  contrary
            to its political agenda.

         (iv)     The 'dangerousness'  law  is  used  as  a  political  tool
            against those seen as  dissidents  or  otherwise  opposing  the
            regime's political agenda

         (v)      Those regarded by  the  Cuban  authorities  as  opponents,
            dissidents  or  defectors  can  be  at  risk  of  treatment  of
            sufficient  severity  to  amount  to  persecution.   Whether  a
            particular individual will be at such  risk  depends  upon  his
            background and profile but in general terms an active political
            opponent who has come to the attention of  the  authorities  or
            someone who has been openly disloyal to the regime is likely to
            be at such risk.

         (vi)     This guidance replaces that given in  OM  (Cuba  returning
            dissident) Cuba [2004] UKAIT 00120 which is  no  longer  to  be
            regarded as providing country guidance".

54. The cases EB (Ethiopia) and MA (Ethiopia) relate to the deprivation  of
    nationality but both cases identify that the deprivation of nationality
    which has the effect of  removing  and  excluding  someone  from  their
    country of nationality is potentially a ground for refugee  protection.
    The Cuban provisions are indeed globally rare and can, as seen from the
    expert reports below,  operate  permanently  to  remove  from  a  Cuban
    national their access to the country.

55.   The consequences of remaining outside Cuba for an extended  time  can
    be particularly severe.   The  stipulations  regarding  return  can  be
    draconian, and, despite the relaxation for some  Cuban  nationals,  the
    conditions have plainly been long  standing,  sustained  and  systemic.
    The effective exclusion of a  national  in  such  an  institutionalised
    manner, we accept can be identified as incompatible  with  refugee  and
    international human rights law.  Secondly, Ms Cunha accepted that  even
    if the appellant could access Cuba, he would be denied access to social
    and economic rights which would include employment, housing, healthcare
    and pension rights. She could not tell us how long this state of denial
    would continue.   Owing  to  first  the  exclusion  and  secondly,  the
    character and possible indefinite nature of deprivation of  significant
    rights,  we  conclude  both  forms  of   treatment   would   constitute
    administrative and punitive measures for the  purposes  of  an  act  of
    persecution under Regulation 5(1) (cited above).

56. Cuban laws  are  inherently  discriminatory  when  those  laws  exclude
    nationals from returning, particularly those who  have  been  out  with
    Cuba for more than 24  months.   Those  laws  implement  a  politically
    motivated process for repatriation resulting in, for  those  unable  to
    comply, being condemned to exclusion.

57. Mr Alpinsar, a lawyer whose expertise was not challenged,  submitted  a
    written report and described Cuban  law  as  politically  motivated  as
    follows:

         "The status as �migr� is crystal clearly (sic) defined by the Cuban
         law: a national who continuously  have  stayed  for  more  than  24
         months without authorisation or have  settled  abroad  without  the
         relevant permit.  Any �migr� in the appellant's  position  will  be
         blacklisted in the highly politicised Cuban society"

58. The  operation  of  the  legal  scheme  appears  both  persecutory  and
    motivated for a Convention reason.  From  the  evidence  before  us  we
    accept that the bar from re-entry and adoption of civil  rights  within
    Cuba are for reasons which are political, that is, the application of a
    law directed towards punishing dissenting  behaviour  that  is  not  in
    conformity with the Communist Party of Cuba.

59. We accept that a Cuban citizen designated as an emigrado and  denied  a
    right to have a repatriation application considered  without  proof  of
    legal residence in the UK and proof of support from those in the UK can
    render 'emigrados' to fall into a "class of persons" that  is  separate
    and discrete.  Such 'emigrados' can be defined as a particular class by
    their exclusion and the deemed nature of their political dissidence.

60. It is no answer that the decision to bar the appellant merely  conforms
    with the wishes of the appellant as can be seen from paragraph 58 of MA
    (Ethiopia) or that that the bar conforms with the domestic laws of Cuba
    as can be seen from the ruling of Lady Justice Arden in R (Tientchu)  v
    IAT [2000] EWCA Civ 385.  The fact that someone can be punished in  the
    'same way as all other citizens'  does  not  respond  adequately  to  a
    complaint of persecution.

61. With regards the appellant our starting point is the findings  made  by
    the First-tier Tribunal Judges Chohan and Telford, and  we  agree  that
    the key issue of ability to return was not under the spotlight in those
    decisions rather the risk to the appellant once he had returned and was
    in Cuba.  The previous decisions are set out in detail above.

62. It is important to note that the appellant's credibility as a whole was
    not challenged in terms of his  activities  in  Cuba.   Indeed,  it  is
    accepted that he left Cuba in 2007 and travelled to the United  Kingdom
    and although Judge Chohan found that there was no adverse  interest  in
    the appellant or active ill-treatment, otherwise the Cuban  authorities
    would not have allowed him to leave the country, it did appear to  have
    been accepted that, as the appellant claimed, he was considered  to  be
    generally anti-government. Judge Chohan states quite  clearly  that  he
    had no reason to disbelieve the appellant's account, albeit  there  was
    nothing to suggest he had ever been persecuted or ill-treated or  would
    be if he were returned to Cuba for his activities in Cuba.

63. The second point to note is that, as Mr Fripp confirmed,  and  contrary
    to the  finding  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Telford,  whilst  the
    appellant has been attempting to establish communication with the Cuban
    authorities  and  obtain  information  on   his   return,   information
    transpired and was confirmed to those authorities, that  the  appellant
    is now a failed asylum seeker.  Additionally, there  was  no  anonymity
    direction given by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Lawrence's  decision
    albeit that it has now been set aside.  In terms of the  definition  of
    dissident, as Fernandez  held  this  can  include  anyone  engaging  in
    activities regarded by the authorities as  contrary  to  its  political
    agenda.  We are persuaded that the appellant's act of remaining outside
    Cuba, and his failed asylum claim, within the context of  his  previous
    accepted disaffection with the Cuban regime,  could  be  construed  and
    perceived by the Cubans as contrary to its own political agenda.  It is
    within this context that  the  appellant  would  now  have  to  make  a
    detailed application to the Cuban Embassy.  This is  not  an  appellant
    who would be returning and merely showing his passport  to  immigration
    officials on re-entry for re-admission to his country of origin.

64. Ms Cunha took us carefully through the Austrian Red Cross Accord Report
    dated August 2017 and which post-dated  both  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decisions of 2007 and 2013.  In particular,  she  referred  to  section
    1.3.2 entitled "Regaining residency rights" which referred to Decree No
    305  and  the  relevant  Article  47  to  Article  50  of   the   Cuban
    constitution.  This confirms that emigrated Cuban nationals are allowed
    temporary visits to Cuba of up to 90 days and those who  are  residents
    abroad are allowed visits to Cuba  of  up  to  180  days.   Article  48
    stipulates  that  "emigrated  Cuban  nationals  who  wish  to  take  up
    residence in the national territory have to submit an application at  a
    diplomatic  or  consular  representation  abroad  or  at  the  relevant
    department of the Ministry of Interior during their visit to Cuba".

65. Both parties relied on the Accord report and it makes clear that  there
    is an established procedure for processing applications  and  that  the
    Cuban representations and offices abroad forward  the  applications  to
    the Cuban Immigration and Foreign Affairs Department of the Ministry of
    the Interior in Cuba.  That department in turn imposes a  timeframe  of
    not exceeding 90 days to respond to applications referred to in Article
    48, that is for those who wish to take up  residence  in  the  national
    territory.  It would appear that application timeframe  relates  to  an
    application from within Cuba.  The  Accord  Report  also  refers  to  a
    procedure for a Cuban emigrant to reapply for residence  in  Cuba  from
    Cuban consulates abroad and that they must submit a request and a valid
    passport (Article 44).   The  report  underlines  that  "they  have  to
    indicate a reference person in  Cuba  who  is  committed  to  guarantee
    accommodation and upkeep, if applicable, until the  applicant  disposes
    of his own housing and income".  This application is  approved  by  the
    Cuban immigration authorities and allows the entry  into  the  national
    territory for a Cuban emigrant wanting to once again  permanently  take
    up residence in Cuba.  Again, the applications must be submitted to the
    consular offices by the interested parties.

66.  The  Accord  report  identifies  the  activist  Laritza  Diversent  as
    explaining in her article that the new migration law made  it  possible
    for Cuban emigrants  to  regain  their  residency  in  Cuba  and  which
    signified a substantial change compared with previous  legislation  but
    according to Ms Diversent the decision about  regaining  residence  lay
    with the  state  organ  equipped  with  discretionary  powers  and  the
    Ministry of Interior has made transparent that it was going  to  choose
    which emigrants could return and claim their  rights  and  which  could
    not.

67. The Accord report refers to the May 2017 report by  Landinfo  on  Cuban
    entry and exit procedures relating to those who have stayed abroad  for
    more than 24 months and recorded that those who had done so must  apply
    for repatriation and such an application  is  processed  by  the  Cuban
    diplomatic representations abroad and the authorities in  Cuba  make  a
    decision as to whether the  person  is  allowed  to  repatriate.   This
    identifies that:

         "The Cuban authorities must have all the information about why  the
         Cuban wants to repatriate.  The name of the family or guardians  in
         Cuba must be stated  and  a  financial  guarantee  from  family  or
         friends in Cuba must be submitted.  Property belonging  to  persons
         who have received the status of emigrado has been  expropriated  by
         the Cuban state.  Cubans who repatriate, therefore  basically  have
         nothing to return to.  According to information given by  a  source
         for  consular  affairs  in  May  2017,  an  economic  guarantee  is
         therefore necessary for repatriation".

68. At internal page 35 the Accord report identified that the process could
    take several years  but  now  went  much  faster  and  there  was  less
    documentation that had to be presented but identified that persons that
    are qualified as "terrorists or political enemies"  are  excluded  from
    repatriation and such persons were not even allowed to return  to  Cuba
    for a visit.  Nonetheless the procedures continued for repatriation  to
    take place at  diplomatic  representations  abroad.   The  report  also
    states

         "only those people facing legal problems with the  Cuban  state  or
         the state they reside in cannot apply.  All  other  Cuban  citizens
         residing outside the island can without objection apply for it" ...

            "The person [applicant] needs to travel to  Cuba  and  together
            with the relative who owns the property of the place where  the
            returnee is to reside  go  to  a  notary  who  will  officially
            register the applicant as living in that same household".

69. Although the Accord report under section 1.3.3 states that  repatriated
    Cubans are granted the same rights that  the  Constitution  grants  any
    other Cuban citizen  (political  rights,  the  right  to  vote,  social
    rights, healthcare, food distribution as well as the right to education
    if applicable and labour rights), this presupposes that  the  applicant
    would be able to enter and repatriate and gain residence.

70. There are a number of difficulties for this  appellant.   First,  there
    has been a finding that he was said to be anti-government, albeit  that
    he was not detained or persecuted whilst in Cuba.  Secondly,  the  fact
    that he has made an application for asylum has now been registered with
    the Cuban authorities and it is likely that that will be  construed  as
    anti-Communist.  It is in this context  that  he  would  be  making  an
    application to return.

71. Thirdly, there has  been  a  raft  of  correspondence  with  the  Cuban
    authorities in the United  Kingdom  in  an  attempt  to  establish  the
    possibility of re-entering Cuba from May 2011  to  10th  January  2018,
    outlining the difficulties the appellant faces in applying for  return.
    There was no challenge to this  Cuban  documentation  and  we  have  no
    reason to classify it as unreliable, indeed some of  it  emanates  from
    the Home Office.  The Cuban documentation reflects and  emphasises  the
    information cited in the reports above.

72. A letter from the Home Office  UK  Visas  and  Immigration  dated  10th
    January  2018  recorded  that  the  UK   Visa   Country   Liaison   and
    Documentation Unit confirmed they had a meeting in June 2017 with Cuban
    Embassy officials regarding returns to Cuba  and  identified  that  the
    appellant's relatives had sent a letter to the consulate  stating  they
    did not give him support to return to Cuba.

73. Further, a copy of the letter from the Embassy of Cuba  in  the  United
    Kingdom from Mr Lidice Lopez confirmed that this  particular  appellant
    had lost his permanent residence in Cuba and was considered a permanent
    resident of the United Kingdom and may travel on a visit visa  to  Cuba
    but must have a valid Cuban passport with an entry permit  (habitation)
    with a visa for two years or more from the country  where  he  resides.
    The letter quoted from the Migration Procedure Manual for  the  Foreign
    Service of the Republic of Cuba and confirmed that Cuban nationals  are
    permitted to travel abroad for a period of 24 months counting from  the
    day of departure but were required to obtain extensions, and those  who
    stayed without authorisation were considered as refusing "to return  to
    the country and are deemed as emigrants".  Such �migr�s who would  like
    to resettle needed to apply for  official  process  through  the  Cuban
    consular and there were specific requirements such that  the  applicant
    needed to make an official request, and  further  provide  a  "notarial
    deed in which the person of reference in Cuba  committed  to  guarantee
    accommodation and relevant allowance until the interested party is able
    to afford his own accommodation and self-sustenance".

74. All the requirements mentioned were compulsory and there was  no  other
    official procedure for a Cuban �migr� citizen to resettle in Cuba.  The
    conditions made clear in this letter included that the  appellant  must
    have a visa for two or more years from the country where the  appellant
    resides.

75. Quite apart from the accommodation and self-sustenance conditions,  the
    appellant has never had status in the United Kingdom and cannot  comply
    with this requirement; it is also  apparent  that  this  appellant  has
    'legal problems' with the state in  which  he  currently  resides,  the
    United Kingdom. He faces removal and thus he would not be  entitled  to
    even make a temporary visit to Cuba for up to 90 days.

76. The expert report of Mr Santiago Alpizar, which was not  challenged  by
    the respondent either by way of his  qualifications  to  give  such  an
    opinion or its  contents,  confirmed  that  for  entering  and  seeking
    permanent  residence  any  �migr�  must  request  repatriation  at  the
    corresponding Cuban Consulate abroad and the decision on the request is
    entirely at the discretion of the Directorate  of  Identification.   Mr
    Alpizar confirmed there was no right to repatriate but simply  a  right
    to request repatriation.  It is possible for a  non-repatriable  �migr�
    to return as a visitor for up to 90 days,  but  the  authorities  might
    grant an  extension  upon  request.   In  view  of  the  Cuban  Embassy
    correspondence, we consider this unlikely.

77. As Mr Alpizar observed, in response to a question of  the  attitude  of
    the Cuban authorities to failed Cuban national asylum  seekers  classed
    as �migr�s wishing to return to Cuba, was given as follows:

         "The inveterate attitude of the Cuban  authorities  towards  asylum
         seekers is to flatten their Cuban citizenship down to the level  of
         traitor.  Rather than �migr�s, they could be  considered  de  facto
         stateless individuals, since the Cuban government  won't  authorise
         them to return as repatriates.  Only if an inscrutable policy works
         in a mysterious way, a Cuban �migr� could return  as  a  repatriate
         after failing to get asylum".

78. The expert reflected the information given by the Cuban  Embassy,  that
    repatriation would only be granted if an �migr� had a  housing  sponsor
    and granted an affidavit in advance.   In  that  way  he  would  obtain
    mandatory ID and ration cards; housing availability was a sine qua  non
    condition for requesting repatriation.

79. Mr Alpizar wrote:

         "The appellant's current application for repatriation has no chance
         of success under the present circumstances"

    and:

         "A Cuban engineer who declined to join the Cuban Communist Party is
         automatically wrapped up in a cloud of suspicion.   'Worm'  is  the
         usual term  for  branding  people  reluctant  to  join  the  party.
         Abstaining from open dissent and behaving a normal citizen  prevent
         being victimise by the law and order apparatus but  the  repression
         turned into what Cubans dubbed  'administrative  execution':  being
         excluded from opportunities of professional development".

    and:

         "For the Cuban authorities HGV [the appellant] is just  a  traitor,
         despite his motivation for leaving his home country, and he is  not
         eligible for repatriation.  It is the typical Catch 22 of the Cuban
         immigration policy.  If you leave the  country  with  no  political
         reason but without permission, you won't be able to be accepted  as
         repatriate, since you will be deemed as a  political  opponent  and
         the repressive action is simply to degrade  you  at  the  level  of
         stateless person".

80. On this basis we consider that the appellant will be considered at  the
    outset generally antipathetic to the regime, not least because  of  the
    acceptance  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chohan  of  his  low-level
    antipathy towards communism whilst in Cuba  but  also  because  of  the
    considerable length of time, that is thirteen years,  outside the Cuban
    state and thirdly, the fact he has claimed  asylum.   Mr  Fripp  argued
    that the appellant's departure was  owing  to  the  politically  driven
    poverty in Cuba.  Previous tribunals found that the appellant  was  not
    actively mistreated in Cuba owing to convention reasons, but  time  has
    moved on.

81. We conclude that although there is legal process by which an individual
    outside Cuba and  rendered  an  'emigrado',  is  able  to  reapply  for
    repatriation and a  resumption  of  rights,  the  treatment  can  still
    constitute  persecution  under  The  Refugee  or  Person  in  Need   of
    International Protection (Qualification) Regulations  2006,  regulation
    5(2)(b) and (c), where the conditions applied effectively  discriminate
    such that the citizen is effectively denied the ability to  return  and
    exercise his rights as a citizen.  We  consider,  on  the  facts,  this
    appellant cannot fulfil the conditions of re-entry owing to his absence
    and the imputed (or indeed actual) political beliefs and is  reasonably
    likely to experience an effective denial  of  his  right  to  re-enter,
    which is a severe violation of his human  rights  through  a  legal  or
    administrative measure implemented  in  a  sufficiently  discriminatory
    manner.   It is also effectively a punishment for  having  been  absent
    from  the  country  for  so  long  which  is  also  defined  under  the
    Regulations as constituting persecution.

82. We considered the Home Office response to country of origin information
    (COI) request dated 12th January  2017  as  this  recorded  that  Cuban
    authorities  no  longer  stigmatize  Cuban  nationals  who  breach  and
    overstay their exit visas, provided 'they're not coming back  as  anti-
    government activists'.  The COI  request  response  included  that  the
    requirements for entry were  set  out  on  the  website  of  the  Cuban
    consulate in Canada. As we have seen, however, the  picture  is  rather
    more nuanced than that described in the request response.

83. HGV's deprivation of re-entry is a denial of his right as a citizen  of
    Cuba and although he has not been stripped of nationality and therefore
    cannot be classified as stateless de jure or de facto, and indeed  that
    was not claimed, the rights attendant on  that  citizenship  have  been
    deprived because of his deemed political opposition to the  government.
    Ms Cunha accepted that his treatment  such  as  denial  of  social  and
    economic  rights,  should  he  be  allowed  to  enter  Cuba  could   be
    indefinite.  The risk of such  denial,  even  if  the  appellant  could
    access Cuba, is likely to have severe consequences and such rights  are
    government controlled. We  consider  that  this  treatment  also  falls
    within the definition of persecution for a convention reason.

84. For the reasons given above we conclude that the appellant on the lower
    standard of proof has fulfilled the criteria for refugee protection and
    similarly protection on Article 3 ECHR grounds.

85. We therefore allow HGV's appeal on refugee  and  human  rights  grounds
    (Article 3).
