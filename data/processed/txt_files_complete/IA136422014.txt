Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Richardson (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant's appeal against decisions to refuse to  vary  his  leave
    and to remove him from the United Kingdom was dismissed  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Hanes ("the judge") in a  decision  promulgated  on  9th
    December 2014.  In refusing the application,  the  Secretary  of  State
    made adverse findings under paragraphs 322(5) and 322(1A) of the rules.
     The judge found that these grounds of refusal were not made out.   The
    Secretary of State also found that the appellant could not show that he
    met the requirements of paragraph 245ZX(a) and (d) and  Appendix  C  of
    the rules.  In this context, the judge found that the funds held in the
    appellant's bank account, shown in a statement  he  provided  with  his
    application for leave, fell below the required minimum for a period  of
    three days in December 2013.

2.    In  response  to  the  respondent's  adverse  finding,  the  appellant
    provided a Lloyds TSB statement showing that in an  account  held  with
    that bank, he held funds which more than made up the difference between
    what was shown in the statement which accompanied his leave application
    and the minimum required under the rules.   The  judge  held  that  she
    could not take this evidence into account, in the light of section  85A
    of the 2002 Act and that  paragraph  245AA  of  the  rules  was  of  no
    substantial assistance to the  appellant.   The  bank  statement  which
    accompanied the leave application was not one which could be  described
    as not containing specified information, so as to give rise to  further
    enquiry by the respondent.

3.   The judge did not hear submissions regarding human rights but  went  on
    to make an assessment,  finding  that  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE of the rules were not met and that there  was  nothing  to  show
    that the appellant enjoyed a family life in the  United  Kingdom.   She
    was not satisfied that he had no ties with Pakistan, given that he  had
    spent all of his life there before his arrival in the United Kingdom in
    2012.  The judge concluded that there were no good grounds for granting
    leave outside the rules and she reminded herself of guidance  given  in
    Nasim and others [2014] UKUT 25 and by the Supreme Court in Patel & Ors
    [2013] UKSC 72 regarding Article 8's limited utility  in  private  life
    cases removed from the core area of protection of an individual's moral
    and physical integrity.  She dismissed the appeal.

4.   In grounds seeking permission to appeal,  it  was  contended  that  the
    appellant had "now proved" that he had sufficient funds, that he had  a
    private life deserving of respect under Article 8 and  that  the  judge
    failed to properly identify the legitimate aim "served by punishing the
    appellant for a minor inadvertent breach of the rules".

5.   Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that an  error  may  have
    arisen in relation to Article 8.  In a rule 24 response, the  Secretary
    of State opposed the appeal on the basis that the  judge  had  provided
    sound reasons to support her findings and conclusions.  So far  as  the
    judge's Article 8 assessment was concerned, the  appellant  was  highly
    unlikely to succeed as he had only limited leave and a poor immigration
    history.

Submissions on Error of Law

6.   Mr Richardson said that there was no reason to disturb  the  favourable
    findings made by the judge with regard to paragraph 322(5) and  322(1A)
    of the rules.  At paragraph 5 of the decision, the judge summarised the
    evidence of the shortfall, amounting to �41.64 over a period  of  three
    days in December 2013.  On any view,  the  rules  had  operated  rather
    harshly, even though  the  appellant  had  a  possible  opportunity  to
    reapply for leave.  He sought to  rely  on  his  Lloyds  TSB  statement
    showing funds of over �3,500, meeting the requirements  of  the  rules.
    The appellant fell foul of the specified evidence rules.  The judge had
    explained why she could not look at the Lloyds  TSB  statement  in  the
    light of section 85A of the 2002 Act but this  provision  was  somewhat
    baffling to  appellants  themselves.   The  judge  did  not  accept  an
    argument based on paragraph 245AA and it followed from  that  that  the
    appellant could not succeed under the  rules  or  in  relation  to  any
    discretion contained in the rules.  No permission to  appeal  had  been
    given in relation to this aspect.

7.   Permission was given on Article 8 grounds.  The  judge  had  not  heard
    submissions from counsel who appeared before her.  She  identified  the
    starting point as Gulshan, considered recently by the Court  of  Appeal
    in Singh  and  Khalid.   It  appeared  that  the  fundamental  approach
    remained, requiring first an application of the rules and then arguably
    good grounds for making an assessment outside them.  At paragraph 16 of
    the decision, the judge found that there were no good  grounds  in  the
    present appeal.  She had in mind here Nasim  and  Patel  &  Ors,  cases
    bearing on the proper approach to private life.   This  was  where  the
    error of law might lie.  The judge ought to have considered  the  rules
    as operating harshly and thereby giving rise to compelling  reasons  to
    look outside the rules.  There was a failure to  consider  whether  the
    case might succeed on this basis, even though the requirements  of  the
    rules themselves were not met.

8.   Mr Tufan said  that  the  judge  had  made  positive  findings  in  the
    appellant's favour under paragraph 322 of the rules.  She had  in  mind
    the correct guidance, including paragraph 57 of the judgment in Patel &
    Ors.  In the present appeal, it might be said that Article 8 was simply
    not engaged, let alone requiring  a  two  stage  assessment.   Overall,
    there was clearly no material error.

9.   Mr Richardson said that he had nothing to add.

Conclusion on Error of Law

10.  It may be accepted, in the light of Mr  Richardson's  submission,  that
    the application of the  rules  might  appear  puzzling  to  appellants,
    including Mr Baber Mahmood.  After all, taking into account his  Lloyds
    TSB account, he  had  sufficient  funds  to  show  that  the  threshold
    required under the rules was met.  The difficulty  he  faced,  however,
    was that the specified evidence of funds  was  not  provided  with  his
    application.  The judge was entitled to conclude that  the  substantive
    requirements of paragraph 245ZX(a) and (d) and Appendix C were not  met
    and, similarly, that paragraph 245AA of the rules did  not  assist  the
    appellant by means of a possible approach or  further  enquiry  by  the
    Secretary of State which might have led to consideration of the  Lloyds
    TSB funds.

11.  The appellant does,  of  course,  have  the  positive  benefit  of  the
    judge's findings regarding paragraph 322(5) and 322(1A)  of  the  rules
    and he may, if he wishes, make a further application for leave.

12.  No submissions were made on the appellant's behalf  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge in relation to Article  8  and  this  is,  perhaps,
    unsurprising.  After all, he has been present in the United Kingdom for
    a relatively short period of time, having been given leave to enter  on
    20th August 2012 and he has had limited leave as a student.  There  was
    nothing to  show  any  family  life  ties  here.   The  judge  made  an
    assessment under the rules, concluding that  the  appellant  could  not
    bring himself within paragraph 276ADE and she  went  on  to  find  that
    there were no arguably good grounds  for  granting  leave  outside  the
    rules.  Paragraph 16 of the decision shows that she also  had  in  mind
    the important guidance given in Nasim and Patel & Ors.

13.  Mr Richardson made a careful submission that  an  error  was  shown  at
    this part of the assessment as the  judge  ought  to  have  taken  into
    account the apparent harshness of the rules, as  showing  a  compelling
    reason to look outside them.  With great respect, I do not accept  that
    an error has been shown here.  Indeed, the apparent harshness manifests
    itself in the form of a "near miss", where the adverse  consequence  of
    the appellant's failure to show the specified evidence looms large  and
    the margin of failure, the shortfall of �41.64 for a  period  of  three
    days, seems very small.  However, as is clear from Patel & Ors, even  a
    "near miss" of this sort does not, of  itself,  add  anything  of  real
    substance to a claimant's Article 8 case.  As Lord Carnwath  held,  the
    proper focus is on the family or private life ties (or both) claimed to
    have been established.  In this context, the decision  shows  that  the
    judge  had  clearly  in  mind  the  appellant's  immigration   history,
    including his relatively recent arrival  and  his  presence  here  with
    limited leave as a student.  A careful reading of paragraphs 15 and  16
    of the decision shows that the judge maintained her focus  properly  on
    the appellant's private life ties, such  as  they  were.   Taking  into
    account the guidance in Nasim particularly, even if the judge  did  err
    in failing to make an assessment outside the rules, there  was  nothing
    in the appellant's case showing that the public interest in maintaining
    immigration control (in pursuit of the economic wellbeing of the United
    Kingdom) was outweighed.  The requirements of the rules  were  not  met
    and  the  evidence  disclosed  only  very  modest  private  life   ties
    established here during the currency of his student leave.

14.  Overall, the judge was entitled to conclude that  the  appellant  could
    not succeed under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.
