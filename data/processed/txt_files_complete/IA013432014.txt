                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Somal promulgated on 18th March 2014, following a hearing on 7th  March
    2014.  In the determination, the judge allowed the appeal on Article  8
    ECHR grounds of Mr Karamagi Nkaijabuzima.  The Respondent Secretary  of
    State applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Uganda,  who  was  born  on  18th
    November 1966.  He appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 10th December 2013 to be allowed to remain  in
    the UK outside the Immigration Rules on compassionate grounds.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that, having entered the UK as  a  visitor  on
    27th April 2008, and having subsequently  been  granted  permission  to
    remain in the UK as  a  student  from  13th  January  2009  until  22nd
    September 2009, following which he was granted further leave for a post
    studies visa until 18th January 2013,  he  should  now  be  allowed  to
    remain in the UK in order to complete a three  month  course  with  RRC
    Consultants, for which he had already paid tuition fees.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge found that the Appellant could not meet the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE under the Immigration Rules.  However,  the  Appellant
    was embarked on studies.  In OA (Nigeria) [2008] the  Court  of  Appeal
    held that if there was some  evidence  that  forcing  an  Appellant  to
    return to Nigeria would impact upon his studies, then this  could  lead
    to Article 8 rights prevailing over immigration considerations.

 5. The judge held that,  "the  evidence  is  that  he  has  been  studying
    throughout and if anything working hard and achieving academic success"
    and that "he has never breached the Immigration Rules" and that "he has
    invested heavily in monetary terms in his education in the  UK  and  he
    has ample financial funds to complete his course, of  which  there  are
    only a few months left" (paragraph 15).

 6. Given this was the case, the judge found that  "on  balance"  that  "he
    should be allowed to complete the course he  is  undertaking  on  human
    rights grounds" (paragraph 15).  The appeal was allowed on the basis of
    Article 8 of the HRA 1998.

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the judge erred  in  law  because
    the strictures in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 and in Patel [2013] UKSC 72 had
    not been  followed  by  the  judge.   The  judge  could  only  consider
    freestanding Article 8 rights if there were "compelling  circumstances"
    that justified his going outside the Immigration Rules and entering the
    domain of freestanding Article 8  jurisprudence.   The  case  of  Patel
    [2013] UKSC 72 had emphasised (at paragraph 57)  that  the  Appellant's
    education when seen in isolation is insufficient to engage Article 8.

 8. On 30 April 2014, permission to appeal was granted by the Tribunal.

The Hearing

 9. At the hearing before me on 10th June 2014, Mr Whitwell  also  referred
    to the recent Tribunal judgment in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640, where the
    judgment of Cranston J emphasised even more the compartmentalisation of
    the Immigration Rules  separately  from  freestanding  Article  8  ECHR
    rights, when regard is had to an applicant's  private  or  family  life
    rights.  Mr Whitwell also drew my attention to the more recent Court of
    Appeal judgment in Haleemudeen where Beatson  LJ  emphasised  that  the
    Rules have a greater weight than merely as a  starting  point  for  the
    consideration of proportionality and that  an  explanation  had  to  be
    given for why Article 8 freestanding, when a  case  could  not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules (see paragraph 47).  My attention was  also
    drawn to the Upper Tribunal decision in Nasim [2014] UKUT 00025.

10. Finally, Mr Whitwell drew my attention  to  the  Respondent's  Rule  24
    response, which I have taken into account.

11. For his part, the Appellant himself relied upon a typed letter  to  the
    effect that he had provided evidence  of  his  employment  and  of  his
    studies and that he was simply seeking  more  time  to  be  allowed  to
    complete three months of his studies so that  he  does  not  become  an
    overstayer and fall foul of the law in this country.

12. He states in the letter that:

         "I have legally lived here and I have been compliant to Immigration
         Rules for over five years; and more so I  have  been  leveraged  to
         contribute towards state development in form of  hard  working  and
         paying taxes of which I contribute ï¿½620  in  the  form  of  monthly
         tax."

    The Appellant appeared  in  person  and  his  representations  did  not
    necessarily deal with the points in issue before this appeal in the way
    that they should have done.

No Error of Law

13. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside that decision.  My reasons  are
    as follows.

14. This is a case where there was never any question  that  the  Appellant
    could not succeed under the Immigration Rules.  Indeed,  the  Appellant
    did  not  make  an  application  under  the  Immigration  Rules.    His
    application was  to  be  allowed  to  remain  in  the  UK  outside  the
    Immigration Rules on compassionate grounds.   However,  the  judge  did
    consider paragraph 276ADE and  briskly  concluded  that  the  Appellant
    could not succeed under the Rules (paragraph 8).

15. It was only after this, that the judge went on to consider  Article  8.
    It is well-known that "exceptionality"  is  not  a  legal  test  to  be
    satisfied.  Lady Hale  has  made  it  clear  in  the  Genoa  case  that
    "exceptionality" is simply a prediction of the state of facts known  to
    exist or likely to exist.  In this case, the judge is clear  about  two
    matters.

16. First, that a disruption of a person's studies "in itself could not  be
    conclusive evidence of interference with private life"  (see  paragraph
    13).

17. Second, that "a student here on a temporary basis has no expectation or
    right to remain in order to further ...  ties  and  relationships  ..."
    (paragraph 14).

18. It was on the basis of these two fundamental considerations,  that  the
    judge then made a finding in two respects.

19. First, that the degree of disruption to the Appellant's ability to  get
    a degree and promote his future would engage Article 8 (paragraph  13).



20. Second, that the Appellant has not just been working in  this  country,
    and not just been achieving academic success but that "he has  invested
    heavily in monetary terms in his education"  and  that  "he  has  ample
    financial funds to complete his course".   But  more  importantly  even
    than this, was the fact  that  "there  are  only  a  few  months  left"
    (paragraph 15).

21. In this respect, the judge was entitled to conclude that the balance of
    considerations in a "proportionality" exercise fell in  favour  of  the
    Appellant on the facts of  this  case.   It  is  not  for  a  reviewing
    Tribunal to interfere with such findings unless they can be said to  be
    "perverse" or otherwise "irrational".

22. The judge gave careful and considered attention  to  the  facts  before
    her.  She considered in a manner that was entirely open to her.   There
    is no error of law.

Decision

23. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's  decision.   The
    determination shall stand.

24. No anonymity order is made.
