For the Respondent:    Mrs Alice Holmes, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh. He was granted permission to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal by Judge Brunnen, a  Judge  of  the  First
    Tier Tribunal against the decision of Judge Abebrese who had  dismissed
    his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State refusing  his
    application to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.  Permission  had  been
    granted on 18 August 2014.


 2. Upon the appeal coming before me the  representatives  of  the  parties
    agreed that there were material errors of law in the decision of  Judge
    Abebrese such as failure to realise that  the  appellant's  application
    had been made before the change in the Rules and  yet  he  had  applied
    paragraph 276ADE and given no consideration to  the  appellant's  claim
    under Article 8 outside the Rules. Mr Colman argued that the only  fair
    way of resolving the issues raised in the appellant's appeal  would  be
    to direct it to be heard afresh on all issues by a Judge at  the  First
    Tier Tribunal other than Judge Abebrese. Mrs Holmes agreed with that.

 3. Accordingly I directed that the appeal be allowed on the basis that  it
    be reheard on all issues by a Judge  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  as
    requested by the parties, having been satisfied that the  determination
    of Judge Abebrese was unsustainable for material errors in law.
