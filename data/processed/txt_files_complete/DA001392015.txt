Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Poland.  He was successful  in  obtaining
    a grant of permission to appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT) Judge Gibbs who, in a decision sent  on  22  June  2015,
    dismissed his appeal which challenges a decision made by the respondent
    on 24 February  2015  to  make  deportation  order  against  him  under
    Regulations 19 and 21  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.

2.   As he did before the FtT judge, the appellant has chosen  to  represent
    himself at this hearing and I took steps to ensure that he was able  to
    put his case properly.

3.   The appellant, who is aged 28, arrived in the  UK  on  28  March  2012.
    There is a European Arrest Warrant (EAW)  outstanding  against  him  in
    respect of convictions in Poland on 8 September  2006  and  28  October
    2008 for possession and supply of cannabis for which he  was  sentenced
    to one year's imprisonment and ten months, ten days respectively.  That
    warrant has not been activated but the  appellant  states  that  he  is
    ready to comply with it if and when served.

4.    The  appellant  first  came  to  the  adverse  attention  of  the   UK
    authorities in September 2012 when he was cautioned  for  battery.   He
    was again cautioned by the police on 13  August  2014  for  an  offence
    against a person.  In 2015 he was charged with assaulting a  member  of
    the public and a police officer.  At the date when the judge heard  the
    appellant's case these charges were still outstanding.  Although (being
    a post-decision fact) it is not relevant to my decision on whether  the
    judge erred in law, it is appropriate to note that on the 6 August 2015
    Willesden Magistrates Court found him not guilty of common assault  and
    assault on police.

5.   The judge heard evidence from the appellant.  At paragraphs 13  and  14
    the judge stated:

         "13. The appellant did not dispute  the  facts  relied  on  by  the
             respondent. His evidence is that when he came to the  UK.   He
             explained that his prison sentence in Poland was suspended but
             he decided to leave Poland so that he could get away from  the
             drugs (he was previously a drug addict) and that since he  has
             been in the UK he has been clean.  He  accepts  that  he  will
             have to return to Poland and has attended court regarding  the
             European Arrest Warrant but he does not want  to  be  deported
             because he hopes to be able to return to the UK in the future.
              He has always worked whilst he has been in the UK and has not
             claimed benefits.  He has a Polish girlfriend in the UK.

         14.  With regards to the caution in 2012  the  appellant  explained
             that people in his house had been plotting against him and  he
             accepts that his behaviour was over the top. With  regards  to
             the caution in 2014 the appellant stated that he is trying  to
             appeal against this. The charges against him brought  in  2015
             have not yet been resolved and he has pleaded  not  guilty  to
             these charges."

6.   At paragraph 15 the judge said he accepted that "the  appellant  was  a
    credible witness".

    He then set out his reasons for dismissing the appeal at paragraphs 16-
         19

         "16. The appellant has been in the UK for just over 3 years.  I  am
             satisfied that he has been self-supporting in  this  time  and
             speaks a limited degree of English, which is evidence of  some
             integration.  However, his own evidence is that his girlfriend
             is Polish and he did require the interpreter  for  the  appeal
             hearing.  I  place  weight  on  the  fact  that  neither   his
             girlfriend nor any friends  attended  the  appeal  hearing  to
             support him and that this is evidence of  limited  integration
             in the UK. In addition the appellant has only lived  here  for
             just over three years whilst he has spent the majority of  his
             life in Poland.  I am therefore satisfied that his deportation
             would be proportionate when balanced against the private  life
             that he has established in the UK, and when taken into account
             alongside his behaviour both in Poland and whilst here.

         17.  Despite being here for only three years he has  found  himself
             involved on 3 occasions with the police and although there  is
             no conviction /caution for the events in 2015 I  am  satisfied
             that there is evidence that he has displayed  violent  conduct
             whilst in the UK on at least 2 occasions.  Although  on  their
             own these incidents may not seem particularly  serious,  I  am
             satisfied that taken together with the fact that the appellant
             was drunk on at least  one  of  the  occasions  he  has  shown
             himself to be a violent person with a tendency to violence.  I
             am satisfied that a person with this  type  of  behaviour  and
             history  can  be  said  to  present  a  genuine,  present  and
             sufficiently serious threat affecting one of  the  fundamental
             interests of society (i.e. a peaceful and safe society).

         18.  Further, I also place weight on the fact  that  the  appellant
             knowingly left Poland when he should not have.  This in itself
             does not display a positive view  of  the  appellant  and  his
             attitude towards law and order.

         19.  I am therefore satisfied that in  accordance  with  Regulation
             19(3)(b) his removal is justified on grounds of public policy,
             public security or public health in accordance with Regulation
             21."

7.   The appellant's principal ground of  appeal  was  that  the  judge  had
    erred in finding that  he  was  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat to fundamental interests of society as (i) he had  never
    been convicted of a criminal offence in the UK; (ii) the  two  cautions
    were for relatively minor matters; and (iii) he  had  turned  his  life
    around (he now having a job and a steady girlfriend with  whom  he  has
    been cohabiting since July 2014).

8.   Mr Jarvis for the respondent  submitted  that  Regulation  21  did  not
    require a person to have been  convicted  of  crimes:  it  referred  to
    "personal conduct" that  posed  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat to fundamental interests of society and  the  judge  had
    been entirely justified to find the appellant's conduct to  cross  that
    threshold.  His personal conduct encompassed his  offences  in  Poland.
    Although they had been committed in 2006 and 2008 the fact  the  Polish
    authorities had issued an EAW against him when he left Poland in  early
    2012 demonstrated that he was now a fugitive from justice.  So  far  as
    concerns his personal conduct in the UK, he had demonstrated a  pattern
    of violent behaviour.  The appellant submitted that he had left  Poland
    to get away from bad company; he no longer  had  anything  to  do  with
    drugs; he had been given a suspended sentence and had not understood he
    should not have left  Poland;  he  was  young  at  the  time  of  those
    offences; they only involved cannabis.  In relation to the cautions  he
    had received in 2012 and 2014 he accepted his behaviour  was  over  the
    top but neither incident was serious as he understood what was meant by
    serious offences.

Error of law

9.   I am satisfied that the FtT judge erred in law. The judge concluded  at
    paragraph 76 that the incidents in  2012  and  2014  meant  that  "[the
    appellant] has shown himself to be a volatile person, with  a  tendency
    for violence.  I am satisfied that a person with this type of behaviour
    and history can be said to present a genuine, present and  sufficiently
    serious threat to the fundamental interests of society (i.e. a peaceful
    and safe society").

10. The fundamental flaw with this assessment is  that  the  appellant  had
    given evidence to the judge that he had turned his life around and that
    since July 2012 when he started living with his girlfriend he was  more
    stable and settled. The judge  said  that  he  found  the  appellant  a
    credible witness.  He was obliged, therefore, to explain why he did not
    accept that the appellant had rehabilitated.  He could not base himself
    on the two assault charges brought against the appellant in 2015 as  he
    himself specifically (and properly) ruled they were  still  outstanding
    and so he should confine himself to the two occasions in 2012 and 2014.
     He was entitled to treat as evidence of the appellant's poor  personal
    conduct the separate fact that he knowingly left Poland when he  should
    not have, but in the absence of any  engagement  with  the  appellant's
    explanations for his having done so, it cannot be said that  the  judge
    properly assessed the conditions set out in Regulation 21(5)(c).

Re-making of the decision

11.   Having  informed  the  parties  that  I  had  decided  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law, I asked the appellant if he wished to  proceed
    and whether he wished to give  and/or  call  evidence.   He  then  gave
    evidence. In summary he said that he  accepted  that  if  the  EAW  was
    activated he would return to Poland although he doubted  that  for  the
    offences concerned the Polish authorities would still  want  to  punish
    him.  He had committed those offences when 18 and he had changed a  lot
    since then.  He believed  that  since  he  has  been  living  with  his
    (Polish) girlfriend he is more settled.  In the 2014  incident  he  did
    not believe he was drunk although he had been for a drink.  In the 2012
    incident he accepted he had made a mistake.  He recognised that he  had
    been "na�ve and immature" (his aunt's words) and that he had a  problem
    with ABHD.  He was not addicted to alcohol and just drank occasionally.
     He did not believe he had a tendency to violence.

12.  I then heard from the appellant's girlfriend who  confirmed  that  they
    had  been  living  together  since  July  2014.   She  also  knew   the
    appellant's uncle and aunt who, like her, believed  the  appellant  was
    more settled now. She confirmed that the appellant drank a little  bit,
    but just normally.  She had never been in fear of  him.   She  had  not
    been able to come to the hearing before the FtT judge because  she  was
    working and covering for her manager who was on holiday.

13.  I then heard closing submissions from Mr Jarvis and the appellant.   Mr
    Jarvis said he accepted the appellant was integrated into the UK  in  a
    number  of  respects,  through  work  and  his  relationship  with  his
    girlfriend, but he was also someone with  continuing  close  ties  with
    Poland where his parents and sister lived.   Although  the  appellant's
    case was outside the paradigm of someone with criminal convictions, his
    personal conduct did disclose a pattern of violence and the  fact  that
    the  appellant  had  triggered  an  EAW  by  leaving  Poland  showed  a
    significant lack of respect for law and the interests of society.

14.  In remaking this decision I take into account the  record  of  evidence
    as recorded by the  FtT  judge  who  found  the  appellant  a  credible
    witness.  The respondent has not challenged this  finding  and  I  also
    found the appellant to be credible and straightforward.

15.  I also found the evidence of his girlfriend direct  and  convincing.  I
    must also have regard to the witness statements from the appellant, his
    girlfriend and two character statements from JW  and  AP.   I  have  no
    hesitation in allowing this appeal.  This is not to diminish  the  poor
    conduct of the appellant who since he arrived in March  2012  has  been
    the subject of two cautions and also the subject of an arrest in  2015.
     There is also the important matter of the EAW.  This is evidence  that
    he has come to the adverse attention  of  the  Polish  authorities  for
    failing to abide by conditions that  were  attached  to  his  suspended
    sentences for offences involving cannabis committed in 2006 - 2008.  By
    coming to the UK he has rendered himself a  fugitive  from  justice  in
    Poland and there is a  European  public  interest  in  fugitives  being
    brought to justice.

16.  The appellant accepts that he has  behaved  in  unacceptable  ways  and
    that his behaviour in one incident 2012 and another in 2014 resulted in
    the police taking action against him in.  Although he was acquitted  in
    August 2015 of charges of assault, it remains that it was his behaviour
    that brought him to the adverse attention of the police.

17.  However, the appellant is an EEA national.  It is not disputed that  he
    is in the UK exercising Treaty rights. Although he still retains strong
    links with family in Poland, he had succeeded in getting away from  bad
    influences in Poland, in getting work in the UK and in entering into  a
    durable relationship  with  his  girlfriend  who  is  a  fellow  Polish
    national also in  the  UK  exercising  Treaty  rights.   Being  an  EEA
    national exercising a right of residence  a  deportation  decision  can
    only be justified in  his  case  if  it  fulfils  the  requirements  of
    Regulation 21.  In particular the respondent has to show  his  personal
    conduct represents a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
    to one of the fundamental interests of society.  His history  of  being
    cautioned in the UK does show him to have behaved in a violent  way  on
    one occasion and an unruly way on another, but on neither occasion  was
    his behaviour seen by the police to  justify  a  criminal  prosecution.
    Although I concur with  Mr  Jarvis  that  Regulation  21(5)(c)  is  not
    restricted to personal conduct in the form of criminal acts, it  cannot
    be overlooked that all of his actions, although involving some level of
    violence, were at the low end of  the  spectrum,  below  the  level  of
    criminality.

18.  In addition, on the strength of the  appellant's  evidence,  which  has
    been accepted as credible, he has made objective changes to his pattern
    of living. He  is  no  longer  involved  with  drugs.   He  is  not  an
    alcoholic.  He has a stable relationship.  He has an aunt and uncle who
    watch out for him.  He has a job. Although he  still  lacks  full  self
    awareness of his past behaviour,  he  is  clearly  making  progress  to
    settling down into a  normal  life.   In  this  context  it  is  simply
    impossible to describe him  as  a  present  and  "sufficiency  serious"
    threat to the fundamental interests of society.

19.  I have already weighed in the balance against him the fact that  he  is
    a fugitive from Polish justice.  At the same time it  is  a  matter  of
    some importance that there is a  separate  mechanism  from  deportation
    that exists to achieve his removal from the UK,  by activation  of  the
    European  Arrest  Warrant.   It  appears  that  consideration  of   its
    activation was deferred  previously  because  of  the  charges  brought
    against him in 2015 by UK police.  Those charges have  now  lapsed,  he
    having been acquitted in a UK court.

20.  It is to the appellant's credit that he says he  will  not  resist  any
    execution of the EAW.   On the limited evidence before me, it  may  not
    necessarily be the case that the  Polish  authorities  will  choose  to
    execute the warrant, but in any event, if they do the appellant will be
    removed from the UK.

21.  If that warrant is executed and the appellant then  serves  a  sentence
    in Poland or receives punishment for having broken  conditions  imposed
    on him in Poland, then  the matter of his return to the UK  (should  he
    desire to return), will be for the respondent to consider  at  a  later
    date.  I would record my own view that the appellant's conduct  in  the
    UK up to this point is not such as should cause the respondent to apply
    the provisions of public policy or security against him, but that  must
    be a matter, in the first instance, for the respondent.

22.  For the above reasons

    The FtT judge materially erred in law and his decision  is  set  aside.
    The decision I remake it to allow the appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
