For the Appellant:     Mr. J A Trussler, instructed by Kinas Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal ("FtT")
    Judge Ruth promulgated on 23rd July 2018.  The FtT Judge dismissed the
    appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision of 15th September
    2017 refusing her application for leave to remain in the UK as the
    spouse of Ibrahim Pertek.


 2. Broadly stated, the respondent was not satisfied that the appellant was
    able to meet the financial requirements set out at paragraphs E-LTRP3.1
    to 3.4 of Appendix FM of the immigration rules.  That is, the
    requirement to provide specified evidence of a gross annual income of
    �18,600.  The appellant had claimed that the requirement was met
    through her partner's employed income, as a hairdresser, from two
    companies, Hair Bella Design and Hair Bella. The respondent noted that
    the appellant had provided payslips for her sponsor's earnings covering
    the period between October 2016 and January 2017 from Hair Bella
    Design, and for the period between October 2016 and March 2017 from
    Hair Bella.  The appellant had also provided letters from her sponsor's
    employers confirming that he is paid in cash, as he does not have a
    bank account.  In the absence of bank statements, the respondent
    concluded that it was not established that the appellant's sponsor
    actually received the funds detailed in the payslips.  As the income
    claimed could not be verified, the respondent was not satisfied that
    the minimum income requirement was met.  The respondent considered the
    application of paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM, but concluded that there
    was no evidence of any insurmountable obstacles to the family life
    established by the appellant and her partner, continuing outside the
    UK.


 3. In his decision, the FtT Judge noted, at paragraph [6], that the
    appellant appeals the respondent's decision asserting that it was
    contrary to her rights under Article 8 of the ECHR.  The appeal was
    dismissed by FtT Judge Ruth.


 4. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Dr H Storey on
    21st November 2018. The matter comes before me to consider whether or
    not the decision of FtT Judge Ruth involved the making of a material
    error of law, and if the decision is set aside, to re-make the
    decision.


 5. At the conclusion of the hearing before me, I reserved my decision.  I
    said that I would give my decision and the reasons for my decision in
    writing.  This I now do.





The decision of the FtT Judge


 6. The FtT Judge set out a summary of the issues in the appeal, and the
    evidence that was before the Tribunal at paragraphs [1] to [11] of the
    decision.   At paragraphs [12] to [14] of the decision, the Judge
    records the submissions made by the parties.  Importantly, at [13], the
    FtT Judge noted the submission made on behalf of the appellant that it
    was accepted that the appellant could not satisfy the requirements of
    the rules because of a shortfall in the sponsors salary. The Judge
    however goes on, in that paragraph, to record that he was nevertheless
    "asked to accept the sponsor's evidence that he receives around �3000
    per annum in tips, and that this takes his income over the financial
    threshold ...".  The appellant's case therefore, was that the minimum
    income requirement could be met, provided the Judge accepted the
    evidence of the 'tips' received by the appellant's sponsor.


 7. The Judge's findings and conclusions are set out at paragraphs [17] to
    [43] of the decision.  The Judge found, at [18], that he was in no
    doubt that both the appellant and the sponsor gave credible evidence
    and that they did their best to set out the circumstances as they
    genuinely believe them to be. At paragraph [19], the FtT Judge accepted
    the sponsor's formal earnings insofar as they could be established from
    the evidence before him. Although there remained some ambiguity about
    the sponsor's income, the Judge was prepared to accept that the sponsor
    earned somewhere between �16,380 and �17,100.72 per annum.  On any
    view, that finding in itself was insufficient to satisfy the minimum
    income requirement of �18,600.  It was only if the Judge accepted the
    submission advanced on the appellant's behalf, that the sponsor's
    evidence establishes that he receives around �3000 per annum in tips,
    that the minimum income requirement under the immigration rules could
    be met.


 8. To that end, the Judge found at paragraphs [20] to [22] of the decision
    as follows:


         "20. The difficulty with the evidence, however, is that even
         putting it at its highest the sponsor could not precisely state how
         much he earns in terms of tips and he was only able to estimate. He
         said he receives approximately �60 worth of tips each week and that
         this makes up around �3000 of tips each year.


         21.  These figures were approximate only and the appellant could
         not be more specific. Furthermore, there was absolutely no
         corroborative evidence whatsoever to support the figure of �3000
         per year in tips. It seems to me that the appellant has been on
         notice of the need to evidence his income since September last
         year, a period of around nine months. If he does receive such a
         significant amount in tips it would surely have been possible to
         provide some evidence of this, including a more detailed oral
         testimony not amounting mainly to guesswork and estimation. The
         appellant has not, for example, pointed to any particular deposits
         in the bank account opened in September 2017 to support his claim
         of significant tips and provides no supporting evidence from
         anybody else or in any other documentation.


         22.  On that basis, I conclude that although the sponsor has done
         his best to estimate the amount of tips he receives, this is too
         vague and uncertain to justify the conclusion he probably earns
         enough to take the income over the �18,600 threshold."


 9. The Judge then adopted the five-stage approach set out in Razgar [2004]
    2 AC 368.  The Judge was satisfied that the appellant enjoys a family
    life with her sponsor and that the decision to refuse leave to remain
    may have consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the
    operation of Article 8.  The Judge found that because the requirements
    of Appendix FM were not met by the appellant, the respondent has acted
    in accordance with the law.  The FtT Judge noted, at [30], that the
    real question is whether the decision is a proportionate response to
    the appellant's established family life, in the light of the public
    interest in immigration control.


10. The Judge noted that the appellant cannot satisfy the minimum income
    requirement of the rules, and that the specified evidence, including
    bank statements for the six months leading up to the date of the
    application, could not be provided.  The Judge accepted that there
    would certainly be 'serious obstacles', to return to Turkey,
    particularly for the appellant's sponsor, but concluded, at [35], that
    "those are not obstacles which could not be overcome or which would
    involve very serious hardship.".  At paragraphs [36] to [40], the FtT
    Judge concluded:


         "36. Both the appellant and the sponsor are nationals of Turkey and
         are intimately familiar with that country. The appellant has lived
         in Turkey for all of her life until 2014 and the sponsor has been
         travelling regularly to Turkey over the years, including quite
         recently. They both speak the language and although the appellant
         has diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure, there was
         no evidence before me to suggest she would not be able to receive
         treatment for those difficulties in Turkey.


         37.  The couple is now faced with the choice of either the
         appellant returning to Turkey to make an application to return when
         the sponsor's income reaches the relevant level, or moving to
         Turkey as a couple to carry on their family life together. While I
         accept it would be very disruptive indeed for the sponsor to be
         required to do this, this is not a matter which presents
         insuperable obstacles, cannot be done or which is a difficulty that
         cannot be overcome.


         38.  The sponsor has a long established professional skill as a
         hairdresser and works in the United Kingdom within the Turkish
         community. There is no reason on the evidence before me, why he
         could not establish himself as a hairdresser in Turkey if that is
         the choice he and his partner make. Furthermore, having satisfied
         the financial requirements at the point of entry clearance, there
         seems to me to be no reason why the sponsor cannot do so again in
         due course. When that becomes the case, if this is the choice the
         couple make, the appellant can make an application for entry as a
         spouse from Turkey.


         39.  In the final analysis Article 8 does not provide a free choice
         for individuals to decide where they exercise their family life and
         the financial threshold represents a bright line rule.


         40.  It is a matter of choice for the appellant and sponsor as to
         whether the appellant returns to Turkey to await the sponsor's
         increase in income or the couple decide to move together to Turkey.
         In either case, I conclude that this would not involve significant
         hardship or insurmountable obstacles.


11. At paragraph [43], the Judge concluded that the refusal of leave to
    remain would not be a disproportionate interference with the
    appellant's rights under Article 8 of the ECHR and it follows that her
    appeal was dismissed.


Error of Law


12. The appellant accepts that Appendix FM of the immigration rules
    requires an applicant to provide specified evidence of a gross annual
    income of at least �18,600.  It was uncontroversial that the relevant
    specified evidence referred to in Appendix FM-SE of the rules was not
    provided in support of the application.  It is accepted that the
    appellant had been unable to provide the corresponding bank statements
    covering a period of 6 months prior to the date of the application.  An
    explanation for this was provided.


13. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Trussler adopts the grounds of appeal
    and submits that having accepted the appellant and her sponsor to be
    credible witnesses, who had done their best to set out their
    circumstances without exaggerating their financial circumstances, the
    Judge erred in rejecting the evidence of the income received by the
    appellant's sponsor in the form of the tips received, of approximately
    �60 per week.  He submits that receiving income in the form of 'tips'
    is commonplace within 'hairdressing', and it was irrational of the
    Judge to conclude that the evidence was too vague and uncertain to
    justify the conclusion that the appellant's sponsor probably earns
    enough to take the income over the �18,600 threshold.  If the Judge had
    accepted that evidence as credible, as he should have done, the Judge
    would have been satisfied that the minimum income requirement was met,
    and absent any other countervailing factor weighing against the
    appellant, the appeal would have been allowed on Article 8 grounds.


14. Mr Trussler refers to the evidence of the appellant at paragraph [10]
    of her statement dated 30th June 2018, confirming that she is eager to
    find a suitable job and wishes to work and contribute to the family's
    income.  Her evidence before the FtT Judge was that she had received
    job offers but had been unable to start working because her leave to
    enter had expired, and her passport was with the respondent.  Mr
    Trussler submits that although the question of whether the minimum
    income requirement was met, was a relevant factor, it was not
    determinative of the human rights appeal in the way set out by the FtT
    Judge.  The appellant's sponsor has lived in the United Kingdom for a
    period in excess of 20 years and expecting the appellant and her
    sponsor to live in Turkey together, or apart, whilst an application for
    entry clearance is made by the appellant, is wholly disproportionate to
    the legitimate aim of immigration control.


DISCUSSION


15. The only ground of appeal available to the appellant was that the
    respondent's decision is unlawful under s6 of the Human Rights Act
    1998.  In considering whether the respondent's decision was unlawful
    under s6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 on Article 8 grounds, the FtT
    Judge adopted the step by step approach referred to by Lord Bingham in
    Razgar -v- SSHD [2004] UKHL 27.


16. The issue in this appeal, as is often the case, was whether the
    interference is proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be
    achieved.  I accept, as Mr. Trussler submits, that although the
    appellant's ability to satisfy the Immigration Rules was not the
    question to be determined by the FtT Judge, it was capable of being a
    weighty, though not determinative, factor when deciding whether such
    refusal is proportionate to the legitimate aim of enforcing immigration
    control.


17. Paragraph E-LTRP.3.1(a)(i) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules
    requires that the appellant must provide specified evidence of a gross
    annual income of at least �18,600.  Insofar as is relevant, Appendix FM-
    SE A1(2) provides as follows:


         'In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where
         paragraph 9 applies), all of the following evidence must be
         provided:


             (a)  Payslips covering:


                  (i)  a period of 6 months prior to the date of application
                  if the person has been employed by their current employer
                  for at least 6 months (and where paragraph 13(b) of this
                  Appendix does not apply); or


                  ...


             (b)  A letter from the employer(s) who issued the payslips at
             paragraph 2(a) confirming:


                  (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;


                  ...


             (c)  Personal bank statements corresponding to the same
             period(s) as the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the
             salary has been paid into an account in the name of the person
             or in the name of the person and their partner jointly.


             ...'


18. In SS (Congo) -v- SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387, the Court of Appeal
    considered the proper approach to applications for leave to enter the
    UK outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of ECHR Article 8
    following the Court of Appeal's decision in MM (Lebanon) -v- SSHD
    [2014] EWCA Civ 1985.  In each of the six conjoined cases, the
    applicants had applied for leave to enter as the family member of a
    British national or recognised refugee living in the UK. Each had been
    refused leave because the sponsor's income did not meet the minimum
    requirements in the Immigration Rules Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE.
    The Entry Clearance Officer rejected SS's application for leave to
    enter, on the grounds that her sponsor husband's income was below the
    �18,600 required, and that documents submitted in support of her
    application did not meet the requirements set out in Appendix FM-SE.
    At paragraphs [50] to [53] of his judgment, Lord Justice Richards
    considered the evidential requirements set out in Appendix FM-SE which
    stipulate the form of evidence required to substantiate claims that the
    substantive financial requirements under Appendix FM, have been met.
    He stated:


         "51. In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light of the
         Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as in respect of the
         substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM. In other words, the
         same general position applies, that compelling circumstances would
         have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or LTR where the evidence
         Rules are not complied with.


         52.  This is for two principal reasons. First, the evidence rules
         have the same general objective as the substantive rules, namely to
         limit the risk that someone is admitted into the United Kingdom and
         then becomes a burden on public resources, and the Secretary of
         State has the same primary function in relation to them, to assess
         the risk and put in place measures which are judged suitable to
         contain it within acceptable bounds. Similar weight should be given
         to her assessment of what the public interest requires in both
         contexts.


         53.  Secondly, enforcement of the evidence rules ensures that
         everyone applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally and fairly in
         relation to the evidential requirements they must satisfy. As well
         as keeping the costs of administration within reasonable bounds,
         application of standard rules is an important means of minimising
         the risk of arbitrary differences in treatment of cases arising
         across the wide range of officials, tribunals and courts which
         administer the system of immigration controls. In this regard, the
         evidence Rules (like the substantive Rules) serve as a safeguard in
         relation to rights of applicants and family members under Article
         14 to equal treatment within the scope of Article 8 : compare AJ
         (Angola) , above, at [40], and Huang , above, at [16] ("There will,
         in almost any case, be certain general considerations to bear in
         mind: the general administrative desirability of applying known
         rules if a system of immigration control is to be workable,
         predictable, consistent and fair as between one applicant and
         another; the damage to good administration and effective control if
         a system is perceived by applicants internationally to be unduly
         porous, unpredictable or perfunctory; ... the need to discourage
         fraud, deception and deliberate breaches of the law; and so on
         ..."). Good reason would need to be shown why a particular
         applicant was entitled to more preferential treatment with respect
         to evidence than other applicants would expect to receive under the
         Rules. Moreover, in relation to the proper administration of
         immigration controls, weight should also be given to the Secretary
         of State's assessment of the evidential requirements needed to
         ensure prompt and fair application of the substantive Rules:
         compare Stec v United Kingdom, cited at para. [15] above. Again, if
         an applicant says that they should be given more preferential
         treatment with respect to evidence than the Rules allow for, and
         more individualised consideration of their case, good reason should
         be put forward to justify that."


19. The specified evidence required in support of an application is there
    to establish an audit trail between what is earned by a sponsor as
    shown in wage slips, and what is credited into the bank account.  In
    respect of salaried employment, Appendix FM-SE requires an applicant to
    produce payslips, a letter from the employer and personal bank
    statements corresponding to the same period as the payslips showing
    that the salary has been paid into an account in the name of the
    applicant and their partner jointly.  The production of those documents
    in support of an application provides an audit trail that an applicant
    is employed as claimed, at a salary that meets the income threshold and
    that the payment of that salary is corroborated by the payments into
    the bank account.  I can well understand where, as here, an applicant
    or sponsor claims to be in receipt of a salary or income but there is a
    gap in the evidence such as a lack of bank statements demonstrating
    payment of that income into a bank account, some explanation is to be
    called for, supported wherever possible by some corroborative evidence.
     That is particularly so where, as here, the income is in cash and some
    of that income (the tips) is undocumented. One might for example expect
    to see evidence of that income having been declared to HMRC and the
    relevant tax liability upon that income having been met.  A Judge might
    legitimately in such a case conclude that he or she cannot be satisfied
    that the income claimed, is in fact derived from the employment.


20. Here, it is right to note that the Judge found both the appellant and
    his sponsor to be credible witnesses who did their best to set out the
    circumstances, as they genuinely believed them to be.  It does not
    however follow in my judgement, that the FtT Judge was therefore bound
    to accept the evidence of the appellant's sponsor, that in addition to
    the income supported by payslips, and HMRC documentation, he received
    'tips' of around �3000 each year.  At paragraphs [20] to [22] of his
    decision, the FtT Judge sets out the particular reasons why he was
    unable to accept the evidence that the tips received by the appellant's
    sponsor justify the conclusion that he probably earns enough to take
    the income over the minimum income requirement.  The FtT judge was
    entitled to find that on the evidence, the appellant has not
    established that the minimum income requirement could be met for the
    reasons given in the decision.


21. The judgments of the Supreme Court in Agyarko -v- SSHD [2017] UKSC 11
    and in MM (Lebanon) establish that the fact that the rules cannot be
    met, does not absolve decision makers from carrying out a full merits-
    based assessment outside the rules under Article 8, where the ultimate
    issue is whether a fair balance has been struck between the individual
    and public interest, giving due weight to the provisions of the Rules.


22. The immigration rules require the appellant to provide the specified
    evidence of a gross annual income of at least �18,600.  As Lord Justice
    Richards noted in SS (Congo), and the Supreme Court noted in MM
    (Lebanon), the evidence rules have the same general objective as the
    substantive rules, namely to limit the risk that someone is admitted
    into the United Kingdom and then becomes a burden on public resources.
    There is no doubt that avoiding a financial burden on the state is
    relevant to the fair balance required by Article 8.


23. In deciding whether the refusal is proportionate to the legitimate aim
    of enforcing immigration control, the FtT Judge refers, at [31], to
    s117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  In my
    judgment, the FtT Judge carefully considered whether the refusal of
    leave to remain is disproportionate to the legitimate aim of
    immigration control. I have carefully considered the criticisms made of
    the FtT Judge's assessment of proportionality. Here, it cannot be said
    that the Judge's analysis of the evidence is irrational or perverse.
    The Judge did not consider irrelevant factors, and the weight that he
    attached to the evidence either individually or cumulatively, was a
    matter for him.  It was in my judgment open to the FtT Judge to
    conclude that, weighed against the maintenance of firm immigration
    control, the decision is not disproportionate for the reasons set out
    at paragraphs [35] to [42] of the decision, in particular.


24. It was in my judgement open to the Judge to conclude in the end, for
    the reasons set out in his decision, that the decision would not be a
    disproportionate interference with the appellant's rights under Article
    8.


25. It follows that I dismiss the appeal.
