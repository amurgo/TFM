For the Appellant:     Miss N Patel, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Petterson, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe born on 3rd November 1981.   The
    Appellant claimed to have arrived in the United Kingdom by plane  using
    her own passport on 8th August 2002.  She claimed asylum on  12th  June
    2013.  On 2nd July 2013 the Appellant's claim for asylum and subsequent
    related applications were refused  by  the  Secretary  of  State.   The
    Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Immigration Judge Brunnen
    sitting at Manchester  on  21st  August  2013.   At  that  hearing  the
    Appellant  appeared  in  person.   The  Secretary  of  State  was   not
    represented purportedly due to staff shortages  as  set  out  in  their
    letter of 20th August 2013.  In a  determination  promulgated  on  29th
    August 2013 the Appellant's appeal was dismissed on all grounds.

 2. On 11th September 2013 following the instruction of solicitors  by  the
    Appellant Grounds of Appeal were lodged to the Upper  Tribunal.   Those
    grounds contended that

      i) that the Immigration Judge had committed or permitted a  procedural
         irregularity which made a material difference to the outcome of the
         fairness of the hearing and failed  to  address  the  issue  of  an
         adjournment at the commencement of the  hearing  and/or  failed  to
         grant an adjournment when requested;

     ii) the Immigration Judge had failed to consider significant  case  law
         and facts when assessing the Appellant's human rights  claim  under
         Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights; and

    iii) had failed  to  take  into  consideration  material  case  law,  in
         particular the authority of Beoku-Betts v the  Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 39 particularly with regard  to
         the purported failure by the First-tier Tribunal Judge to  consider
         the impact removal has on each  individual  family  member  of  the
         Appellant, including siblings and partner with whom the Immigration
         Judge had accepted the Appellant had an established relationship.

 3. On 30th September 2013 Designated Judge David Taylor granted permission
    to appeal.   In  granting  permission  he  noted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had been aware that the Appellant's leave to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a family visitor had expired in  March  2003  and
    she had remained here since then as an illegal  overstayer.   He  noted
    that she had made no attempt to regularise her  status  in  the  United
    Kingdom until more than ten years later when she claimed asylum in June
    2013.  He further noted that the first Ground of Appeal argued that the
    judge had erred in failing  to  grant  an  adjournment  to  enable  the
    Appellant to obtain legal representation.  He considered that there was
    no arguable merit in this and that the Tribunal was well accustomed  to
    dealing with unrepresented Appellants and there was no suggestion  that
    the Appellant was a vulnerable adult who might for that reason  require
    representation.

 4. However, he did note that the only other ground related to the  judge's
    decision under Article 8 (outside the  Immigration  Rules).   He  noted
    that bearing in mind the judge's  statement  at  paragraph  35  of  his
    determination  that  there  is  no  "insurmountable  obstacle"  to  the
    Appellant's partner - himself originally  from  Zimbabwe -  returning
    there with her, but the ground was arguable.  He  considered  that  the
    judge had arguably erred in applying the wrong test  which  is  one  of
    reasonableness and not one of insurmountable obstacles.

 5. On 14th October 2013 the Secretary of State responded to the Grounds of
    Appeal under Rule 24.  Within those grounds it is submitted that it was
    immaterial whether the judge used the  term  "insurmountable  obstacle"
    when it was contended that the term is interpreted to mean  whether  it
    is reasonable to expect someone  to  return.   The  Rule  24  statement
    stated that on the evidence before the judge it was clear that  whether
    considered  under  the   Rules   paragraph   (paragraph   35   of   the
    determination) or under  the  second  stage  test  as  approved  in  MF
    (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  (paragraphs  39  to   43   of   the
    determination) that the correct approach was taken for consideration of
    proportionality.  Further, it was submitted therein that  paragraph  42
    of the determination makes it clear that family life  could  reasonably
    be enjoyed elsewhere and that  the  correct  test  had  therefore  been
    applied.

 6. It was on that basis that the appeal first came before me in the  Upper
    Tribunal on 25th November 2013 to determine whether or not  there  had
    been a material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge.  At that hearing it was put to me that the only appeal that  was
    extant before me related  to  one  under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention of Human Rights.  I noted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    had considered Article 8 at paragraphs 32 to 43  of  his  determination
    and that he had at paragraph 35 analysed the requirements  of  Appendix
    FM and paragraph 276ADE and had  also  analysed  the  position  of  the
    Appellant's partner concluding the fact that now that he is settled  in
    the United Kingdom did  not  in  itself  constitute  an  insurmountable
    obstacle.  I found that it was  difficult  from  consideration  of  the
    determination to establish whether or not it was on  that  basis  alone
    that the judge looked at the position under Article 8 and whilst noting
    at paragraph 41 that he had referred to the reasonableness test,  there
    was nothing within the determination to show that he had  applied  that
    test and on that basis I found that there was a material error  of  law
    and that the decision should be set aside.

 7. However I qualified the basis upon which I found such  material  error.
    I noted that Sanade was good authority for  stating  that  once  it  is
    recognised there is only  one  family  life,  and  that,  assuming  the
    Appellant's proposed removal would be disproportionate looking  at  the
    family unit as a whole, then each affected family member is regarded as
    a victim, and that where a child or indeed the remaining  spouse  is  a
    British citizen, and therefore a citizen of the European Union,  it  is
    not possible to require them to relocate outside the European Union  or
    to submit that it would be reasonable for them to do so.  I noted  that
    that aspect had not been considered in any great detail  and  certainly
    had not been analysed alongside the observations of the Upper  Tribunal
    in MF (Nigeria).  In such circumstances I was satisfied that there were
    material  errors  of  law  in  the  determination  of  the   First-tier
    Tribunal's analysis under Article 8 and that the correct  approach  was
    for the matter to be reheard before me as a fresh appeal under  Article
    8 (not an appeal under the new Immigration Rules)  and  I  consequently
    set aside the decision on that basis alone and gave directions for  the
    rehearing of this matter.

 8. Those directions included a direction that there would be leave to  the
    Appellant by her solicitors to lodge an up-to-date bundle  the  content
    of such bundle to be served on the UK Border Agency and lodged at court
    at least seven days prehearing.  The bundle was to include  any  up-to-
    date witness statement relied upon, any  up-to-date  skeleton  argument
    relied upon, and authorities and relevant objective evidence limited to
    the issue of the appeal under Article 8 alone.

 9. It was on that basis that the appeal came back before me for  rehearing
    in April 2014.  The Appellant appeared by her instructed  Counsel  Miss
    Patel.  In support of the appeal I  was  provided  with  an  up-to-date
    bundle of evidence from the Appellant's  instructed  solicitors,  along
    with a supplemental bundle which consisted  of  skeleton  argument  and
    witness statements all of which  I  gave  due  consideration  to.   The
    Secretary of State appeared by her Home Office  Presenting  Officer  Mr
    Harrison.  Mr Harrison had previous experience of  this  matter  having
    appeared before me when the error of law was considered.

Evidence

10. The Appellant attended to give evidence.  She relied on two  documents,
    these being her original witness statement and her supplemental witness
    statement dated 18th April 2014.  She  confirmed  that  she  is  in  a
    relationship with Noel Chivavya and that she has been  cohabiting  with
    him for in excess of two years.  She  stated  that  Mr  Chivavya  is  a
    British citizen and has  lived  in  the  UK  since  2003,  that  he  is
    currently employed at Hitchen Foods Limited as a line leader  where  he
    has worked since May 2011.  He is settled in his job and earns  in  the
    region of �19,000 per annum.  She stated that it is their intention  to
    marry once her visa position has been clarified  and  that  they  would
    like to purchase a property together and have children.  The  Appellant
    advised that they have been attending  an  infertility  clinic  due  to
    difficulties she has experienced in getting pregnant.  She  states  she
    has considerable family in the UK and sees them regularly and that  she
    has been in the UK for in excess of twelve years  and  is  settled  and
    integrated here.  She confirms that she  does  not  have  any  criminal
    convictions and is a person of good character and she seeks  permission
    to remain in the UK with her family and partner  and  to  continue  her
    life with him here.

11. In supplemental evidence-in-chief she confirms that she has  no  family
    in Zimbabwe and that she has 32 family members, the  majority  of  whom
    are cousins living in the UK.  She reiterates that she has  lived  with
    her partner for almost  three  years  and  that  she  knows  nobody  in
    Zimbabwe.

12. The Appellant was cross-examined by Mr Harrison and confirms  that  she
    came to the UK in 2002 to visit her cousin.  She acknowledged that  she
    was granted leave until October 2002 to remain in the UK and  that  she
    asked for a further leave in November 2002 but  that  that  application
    was refused.  When it was put to her that from March 2003 to March 2013
    when she claimed asylum she had no right to be in the UK, her  response
    was merely to state that she gave  her  passport  to  her  sister.   Mr
    Harrison put it to the Appellant that she was an adult and did she  not
    think she had a responsibility to look after her own affairs in the UK,
    to which she responded that she was not sure.

13. Mr Harrison inquired as to whether or  not  the  Appellant  ever  asked
    about her legal status post-2003 and she advised that she did  but  not
    until 2009 and further indicated that  when  she  started  her  current
    relationship in 2010 that her partner did not know her status in the UK
    and that all he knew was that she had forwarded papers to solicitors to
    consider in 2009.  She  confirmed  to  Mr  Harrison  that  she  had  no
    relatives whatsoever living in Zimbabwe.

14. Mr Chivavya attended and  gave  evidence.   He  confirmed  his  witness
    statements and that he is a British national and that he has been in  a
    relationship with the Appellant since 2010.  He  confirms  that  he  is
    settled in his job earning in excess of �19,000 per annum.   He  states
    he does not wish to return to Zimbabwe to restart his life, in that  it
    would be hard for him to go  and  find  employment  and  property.   He
    further  confirms  that  it  is  their  intention  to  marry  once  the
    Appellant's visa situation has been resolved and that the Appellant  is
    currently undergoing fertility treatment.  He confirms that he supports
    her financially and that she has no reliance upon  state  benefits  and
    she would be in a position to apply for a job providing she is  granted
    an appropriate visa.

15. Miss Patel asked him to explain  his  relationship  in  a  bit  greater
    detail and Mr Chivavya pointed out that he has known the Appellant  for
    a number of years but that their relationship did not begin until  2010
    and that they have lived together for some three years.   He  indicates
    that they are both members of the Catholic Church  and  attend  church.
    He states that for some two years now the Appellant has  tried  to  get
    pregnant and that he  cannot  contemplate  a  situation  by  which  the
    Appellant is returned to Zimbabwe.  He states he cannot return  because
    he has his life here and that he has recently been promoted in his job.
     He further confirms that he has no family in Zimbabwe  but  he  has  a
    brother in the UK and he has been in the UK himself now for some eleven
    years.

16. Under cross-examination from Mr Harrison Mr Chivavya confirmed that  he
    came to the UK in 2003 and claimed asylum, and although  it  was  never
    granted he acknowledged he was given indefinite leave to remain and  he
    is now a British citizen.  He stated that when he met the Appellant  he
    did not know her status in the UK and he did not find  out  until  they
    were living together.  He stated he has no friends in Zimbabwe and that
    his friends are scattered around the world and some live in the  United
    States.  He indicated there would be great expense  caused  if  it  was
    necessary for the Appellant to return to Zimbabwe and reapply  to  join
    him as a partner and that he would like to marry the Appellant  but  it
    would be necessary for him to consult with the head of his  family  who
    is his first cousin and it would be necessary for cultural  reasons  to
    meet her family.  If they do get married he would wish to  get  married
    in church.

Submissions/Discussions - April 2014

17. Mr Harrison indicated that this is a case solely put on  an  assessment
    of Article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules  and  the  effect  of  any
    separation or to consider moving elsewhere is what is to be considered,
    i.e. interference with private life.  He submits that there is a  clear
    lack of clarity of the exact position of the Appellant within  the  UK,
    but suffice to say that two and a half years ago her partner was  aware
    she did not have status in the UK and despite this they have  continued
    to build a relationship akin to marriage and that that is what would be
    interfered with.   Consequently  he  submitted  the  issue  is  one  of
    proportionality.

18. He contended that it would be proportionate to require the Appellant to
    leave the UK pointing out that she entered in 2002 and  by  March  2003
    she knew she was without any status in the UK and that  for  ten  years
    she has been an overstayer.  Throughout that time she has been an adult
    and whilst the Appellant  states  that  initially  she  was  under  the
    control of her sister/cousins that  it  was  not  until  2009  she  had
    control of her own passport and took  steps  to  regularise  her  stay.
    That is, in the Secretary of State's view, not an adequate  reason  for
    overstaying.

19. Mr Harrison submitted that  it  is  following  the  legitimate  aim  to
    require the Appellant to leave the UK  and  to  thereafter  seek  entry
    clearance as anyone else would as  the  partner  of  Mr  Chivavya.   He
    points out that there is no  asylum  claim  outstanding  and  therefore
    there is no reason why the Appellant cannot  return  to  Zimbabwe.   He
    does however acknowledge that  that  is  not  a  clear  cut  conclusion
    bearing in mind the relevant  case  law  to  have  to  go  through  the
    bureaucratic process of having to reapply.  He submitted that this is a
    simple case of the legitimate aim of immigration control being followed
    and that this  is,  to  use  his  words,  "a  straightforward  case  of
    proportionality".  He asked me to refuse the appeal.

20. Miss Patel took me to her skeleton  argument  and  submitted  that  the
    Appellant has established family life with her  partner  and  also  her
    extended family.  She refers me to her skeleton.  She accepts that this
    is a traditional Article 8 case and the question is whether or  not  it
    would be proportionate for the Appellant to be asked to  leave  the  UK
    and her extended family.  She relies on a  number  of  authorities  but
    specifically refers me to Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008]  UKHL  39  and  the
    fact  that  the  appellate  authorities  in  determining  whether   the
    Appellant's Article 8 rights  have  been  breached  has  to  take  into
    account the effect of proposed removal upon all members of  the  family
    unit.  She submits that it is necessary for the Tribunal to  conduct  a
    balancing exercise and that the burden is on  the  Respondent  to  show
    that it is proportionate to exclude an Appellant from this country.

21. Miss Patel pointed out  that  it  has  already  been  accepted  by  the
    Secretary of State that the Appellant has family life in  this  country
    and that she is in a long-term relationship and  that  the  couple  are
    actively taking steps to start a family in the UK.  She submits that if
    the Appellant were to be removed even temporarily this would  interrupt
    their family life in the UK and submits that in such circumstances that
    would be unreasonable.  She reminds me that the Appellant has no family
    in Zimbabwe, that she has been here for  twelve  years,  has  developed
    strong family ties within the UK and that her partner is settled in the
    UK earning �19,500 per annum.  She submits that the legitimate aim will
    usually be weighed in the Appellant's favour even when  there  are  not
    children and that it is clear looking at  the  authorities  that  entry
    clearance is not the answer to this appeal and that the  Appellant  has
    taken steps to regularise her status and she  asked  me  to  allow  the
    appeal.

The Position in August 2014

22. It subsequently occurred to me that prior to promulgation Section  117B
    of the Immigration Act 2014 had come into force and that neither  legal
    representative had had the opportunity to make  submissions  to  me  on
    that  specific  point.   Consequently  rather  than   promulgating   my
    determination in August 2014, I gave directions that there be leave  to
    both the Appellant's solicitors and the Secretary  of  State  to  lodge
    written submissions on the effect, if  any,  of  Section  117B  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014 and I restored the hearing for such  further  oral
    submissions as either party's legal representative wished to make to be
    considered in addition to those  written  submissions  I  had  directed
    previously.

23. It is on that basis that the appeal now comes back before me for  final
    consideration.  The  Appellant  continues  to  be  represented  by  her
    instructed Counsel Miss Patel.  On this occasion the Secretary of State
    is represented by her Home Office  Presenting  Officer  Mrs  Petterson.
    The Appellant's instructed  solicitors  have  lodged  a  skeleton,  the
    detail of which I have  read  and  considered  in  its  entirety.   Mrs
    Petterson apologises but points out that there is no skeleton  argument
    provided by the Secretary of State.

Submission/Discussions - 19th November 2014

24. Mrs  Petterson  acknowledges  that  the  Appellant  meets  the  English
    language  requirement  and  that  her   partner   earns   �19,000   and
    consequently the issue of finance is not one that I need  to  consider.
    She submits that the key  issue  relates  to  proportionality  and  the
    establishment of private life.  She points out that the application was
    made some five years ago and that prior  to  the  presentation  of  the
    present application the Appellant had overstayed for some six years and
    that I should not give weight to her private life.  She  accepts  that
    the Appellant has a partner but points out that she came here  in  2002
    as a 21 year old and that she has a poor immigration history and that I
    should refuse the appeal.

25. Miss Patel submits there are only two issues,  namely  the  Appellant's
    relationship and her private life and the weight to be applied to  each
    factor.  She submits that there is no legal  definition  given  to  the
    phrase "little weight" and that it is still for  me  to  take  all  the
    circumstances into account as they currently stand.  She  submits  that
    it  is  important  to  note  that  the  Appellant  did  not  enter  her
    relationship until after she had submitted her application and that the
    statute does not refer to the phrase "no weight" but to little  weight.
    The question is is it proportionate to apply  little  weight  to  these
    particular circumstances and it is for the Tribunal to  strike  a  fair
    balance between the Appellant and the public interest.  She asked me to
    look at all the evidence adduced regarding the  relationship,  pointing
    out that the financial and language requirements are satisfied and that
    the Appellant will therefore be able to integrate into UK  society  and
    in fact that she already has.  She  submits  the  Appellant  wishes  to
    contribute to UK society and that it would be appropriate to  give  her
    credit for this and to allow the appeal.  In reply Mrs Petterson merely
    points out that making an application does not  create  an  entitlement
    for leave to remain.

Findings, Including an Assessment of the Law

26.  It  is  against  this  background  and  these  submissions  that  this
    longstanding matter comes before me now for final  determination.   The
    facts of this case are relatively straightforward:

       . The Appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe.

       . At time of hearing this appeal she has been in the  UK  for  twelve
         years.

       . She does not meet the Immigration Rules.

       . For a period from 2003 to 2013 she was an overstayer.

       . Since 2010 she has been in a settled relationship.

       . Her partner is a British citizen originally from Zimbabwe.

       . She has no children but she is undergoing IVF treatment.

       . She has no family in Zimbabwe.

       . She has extensive family in the UK.

       . Her partner is in full-time employment.

       . Her partner supports her and she does not receive benefits.

27. The  question  arises  as  to  whether  in  such  circumstances  it  is
    appropriate to allow the Appellant's claim for Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

28. In any consideration of an Article 8 claim the starting  point  is  the
    law itself.  Article 8 states:

      a) everyone has the right to respect for his private and family  life,
         his home and his correspondence;

      b) there should be no interference by a public body with the  exercise
         of this right except such as is in accordance with the law  and  is
         necessary in a democratic  society  in  the  interest  of  national
         security, public safety or the economic well-being of the  country,
         for the prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the  protection  of
         health or morals, or for the protection of the rights  and  freedom
         of others.

29. The general approach to Article 8 cases is that in Nhundhu and  Chiwera
    (01/T/H/0613).  In those cases the  Tribunal  said  that,  in  deciding
    claims under Article 8, there is  a  five  stage  test  which  must  be
    applied in order to determine whether a breach has occurred;

      i) does family life, private life, home or correspondence exist within
         the meaning of Article 8;

     ii) if so, has the right to respect for this been interfered with;

    iii) if so, was the interference in accordance with the law;

     iv) if so, was the interference in pursuit of  one  of  the  legitimate
         aims set out in Article 8(2); and

      v) if so, is the interference proportionate  to  the  pursuit  of  the
         legitimate aim?

    Those were essentially the five questions  endorsed  by  the  House  of
    Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

30. It is, of course, well-established that, where the Appellant is in  the
    UK and removal will interfere with the  family  life/private  life  she
    (and since Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39 her family) already  enjoy
    in the UK, then Article 8 can be engaged.  In Ullah and Do [2004]  UKHL
    26 the House of Lords accepted that Article 8 could, in  principle,  be
    relied upon if the effect was that the infringement of the  Appellant's
    rights would occur in the country to which she was to be removed.  That
    scenario of course would not apply  in  this  instant  case  where  the
    Appellant would be returned to Zimbabwe, where there is  no  suggestion
    that she would not be in a position to continue her life albeit that  I
    fully understand she would much prefer to remain in  the  UK  with  her
    partner.

31. In Huang and Kashmiri v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11 the  House  of  Lords  said
    that once Article 8 is engaged the  crucial  question  is  whether  the
    interference complained of  is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim
    sought to be achieved.  The House of Lords phrased the test as follows:



         "If family  life  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  be  enjoyed
         elsewhere the question is simply whether taking full account of all
         the considerations weighing in favour of a refusal the  refusal  of
         leave prejudices the family life  of  the  applicant  in  a  manner
         sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the fundamental right
         protected by Article 8.  The House of  Lords  said  that  attention
         must be paid to the severity and consequences of the interference."



    It is clear in that authority and AS (Pakistan) v SSHD [2008] EWCA  Civ
    1118 that the question of whether the life of the family can reasonably
    be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere is part  of  the  consideration  of
    proportionality.  It is necessary to consider whether the  decision  is
    proportionate  and  the  proportionality  decision  is  one   for   the
    Immigration Judge.  The test is not one of  exceptional  circumstances.
    Once  Article  8  is  engaged  the  crucial  question  is  whether  the
    interference complained of  is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim
    sought to be achieved.  If family life cannot reasonably be expected to
    be enjoyed elsewhere,  the  question  is  simply  whether  taking  full
    account of all the considerations weighing in favour of a refusal,  the
    refusal of leave prejudices the family  life  of  the  applicant  in  a
    manner sufficiently serious to amount to a breach  of  the  fundamental
    right protected by Article 8.  Attention must therefore be paid to  the
    severity and consequences of the interference.  It is also necessary to
    give due consideration to the weight  to  be  attached  to  immigration
    control and the  onus  lies  upon  the  Respondent  to  show  that  the
    interference or lack of respect is "necessary in a  democratic  society
    for one of the stated interests."

32. The Appellant through her Counsel submits that  she  ought  to  benefit
    from the exceptions in Appendix FM in that she and  her  partner  would
    face  insurmountable  obstacles  if  they  attempted  to  relocate   to
    Zimbabwe.  I am not satisfied that such  threshold  has  been  reached.
    There is no practical reason why the Appellant cannot relocate back  to
    Zimbabwe.  She is a Zimbabwean national.  Further whilst her partner is
    a British citizen and may have a secure  job  over  here  there  is  no
    reason  why  he  too  cannot  move,  if  he  so  wishes,  to  Zimbabwe.
    Consequently I am satisfied that the Appellant does not meet  the  test
    to fall within an exception to Appendix FM.

33. The Tribunal in Gulshan made clear and  has  repeated  subsequently  in
    Shahzad  (Article  8:  legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085  (IAC)  at
    paragraph (31):

         "Where an  area  of  the  rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31]  in  particular)
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements
         of the rules, only if  there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
         purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them."

34. Consequently only if there are arguably good grounds for granting leave
    to remain outside the Immigration Rules is it now necessary for Article
    8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are   compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.   Further  whilst
    appreciating that this appeal was heard prior to  28th  July  2014  the
    Immigration Act 2014 is now in  place  and  brings  with  it  mandatory
    requirements relating to the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the  public
    interest under Article 8 which override  existing  case  law.   Section
    117B, Article 8 states:

    (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
         interest.

    (2)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
         of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons  who
         seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom  are  able  to  speak
         English, because persons who can speak English-

         (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

    (3)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
         of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons  who
         seek to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
         independent, because such persons-

         (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

    (4)  Little weight should be given to-

         (a)  a private life, or

         (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

    (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established  by  a
         person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration   status   is
         precarious.

    (6)  In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a qualifying child, and

         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
             United Kingdom.

35. In this case I acknowledge that the Appellant speaks English,  is  able
    to integrate into society but is not financially  independent  in  that
    she is totally reliant for her support on  her  partner.   Paragraph  4
    makes it clear that little weight should be given to private life and a
    relationship formed with a qualifying partner that is established by  a
    person at a time when the  person  is  in  the  UK  unlawfully.   I  am
    satisfied that when the Appellant approached solicitors in 2009 she had
    not entered her current relationship with  Mr  Chivavya.   I  give  her
    credit for this fact and I accept that the relationship was not created
    solely as  a  means  to  try  and  circumvent  the  Immigration  Rules.



36. The Appellant was for six years an overstayer.   She  could  return  to
    Zimbabwe  and  make  a  fresh  application  to  join  her  partner.   I
    acknowledge that the Appellant has claimed that there are  considerable
    family members in this country but none have come  forward  to  provide
    oral testimony and it is conceded (quite properly) by  Miss  Patel  the
    fact that the Appellant is undergoing fertility treatment would not  in
    any way justify her claim for  reaching  the  threshold  of  her  claim
    succeeding on medical grounds.  The fact  remains  that  the  Appellant
    whilst in a relationship is a single woman who  has  overstayed  for  a
    very considerable number of years.  Technically there is no reason  why
    she could not return to Zimbabwe although I appreciate if she  were  to
    do so the position would be that she would then have to  make  a  fresh
    application to enter the United Kingdom as the  partner  of  a  British
    citizen.   Back  in  the  hearing  before  me  in  April  Mr   Harrison
    acknowledged that it was a factor for me  to  consider  as  to  whether
    requiring  an  Appellant  to  return  in  such  circumstances   was   a
    proportionate step.

37. In some respects I am satisfied Section 117B  of  the  Immigration  Act
    2014 is of help to the Appellant's claim.  The Section does little more
    than bring into statute principles that were already  prevalent  before
    the courts.  However reference is made particularly at paragraphs 2 and
    3 to place emphasis on  the  public  interest  and  in  particular  the
    economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom to ensure  that  entrants  are
    financially independent, not a burden  on  the  taxpayer  and  able  to
    integrate  into  society.   I  acknowledge  that  Ms  Gwenzi   is   not
    financially independent but that is at present very  much  due  to  her
    immigration status.  What I am satisfied is that she has been here  now
    for some twelve years, that she has integrated into  society  and  that
    she is not a burden on the taxpayer, being financially supported by  Mr
    Chivavya who is a British citizen.  Having heard the evidence  of  both
    Ms  Gwenzi  and  Mr  Chivavya  I  am  satisfied  that  they  are  in  a
    relationship (something accepted by Mr Harrison and  Mrs  Petterson  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State) and that it  is  their  intention  to
    continue within that relationship on a permanent basis.

38. Reference is made to me with regard  to  the  weight  to  be  given  to
    private life in this matter.  I acknowledge under 117(5) little  weight
    should be given to a private life established by a  person  at  a  time
    when  the  person's  immigration  status  is  precarious.   Clearly  Ms
    Gwenzi's status is precarious and must be so until or unless her appeal
    succeeds.  While she was an overstayer  she  did  not  enter  into  her
    relationship until such time she had submitted a fresh application.

39. In order for leave to remain to be granted outside  the  provisions  of
    the Immigration Rules  there  need  to  be  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under  the  new  Rules  that
    outweighed the public interest in deportation - Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA
    Civ 558.  It is necessary to look at all the evidence to see  if  there
    is anything which has not been adequately considered in the context  of
    the Immigration Rules which could lead to a successful Article 8 claim.
     Authorities do not qualify or fetter the assessment of Article  8  and
    there is no prior threshold which  dictates  whether  the  exercise  of
    discretion should be considered; rather the nature  of  the  assessment
    and the reasoning is informed by threshold considerations.

40. In this case the Appellant has been in the UK twelve  years.   She  has
    established private and with her  partner  a  family  life.   He  is  a
    British citizen.  She speaks English.  She is not  dependent  on  state
    benefits.  She approached solicitors  prior  to  entering  her  current
    relationship.  I acknowledge she has a poor prior immigration  history.
    She is not an economic burden on the  state.   It  would  be  extremely
    difficult if not impossible for her partner to  relocate  and  continue
    his business activity in  Zimbabwe.   It  would  be  possible  for  the
    Appellant to  return  to  Zimbabwe  and  to  thereafter  make  a  fresh
    application to join Mr Chivavya in this country as  his  partner  under
    the Immigration Rules.  The question is however  is  such  a  draconian
    step proportionate.  Weighing all these factors together I am satisfied
    that it would be disproportionate to return the Appellant  to  Zimbabwe
    for that purpose and for all the above reasons I am satisfied that this
    is one of those rare cases where the Appellant's claim succeeds outside
    the Rules pursuant to Article 8 of the  European  Convention  of  Human
    Rights.
