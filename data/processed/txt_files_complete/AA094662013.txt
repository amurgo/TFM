Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Iqbal, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr K Norton, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the DRC born on 13th December 1990 and he
    appealed against the decision of the respondent taken on 21st May  2013
    to refuse his application for further  leave  to  remain  and  to  give
    directions for his removal pursuant to Section 10  of  the  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 1999.

 2. The background to the appeal was that the appellant arrived in  the  UK
    on 25th April 2006 and claimed  asylum  immediately.   He  was  refused
    asylum on 24th June 2006 but granted discretionary leave until his 18th
    birthday.  He made his application for leave on 12th December 2008  and
    his application was refused on 5th November 2011.

 3. The appellant was convicted on 27th April 2010 at Croydon  Magistrates'
    Court for assaulting a bus driver.  He was convicted on 22nd June  2010
    for failing to comply with the community requirements.   He  was  again
    convicted on 15th June  2011  for  obstructing  a  police  officer  and
    indecent behaviour and was fined.  On 5th August 2012 he  was  together
    with an accomplice convicted of  possession  of  a  class  B  drug  and
    robbery and was sentenced to three months' imprisonment  suspended  for
    24 months together with a 24 month community programme.

 4. The appellant had been living with a British partner, S J S,  and  they
    had two children.  He claimed that not only was he in fear of his  life
    should he be returned to the DRC but also that his removal would breach
    his rights to a family and private life.

 5. The refusal decision from the respondent set out that the appellant has
    an unacceptable character and that the decision to refuse to grant  his
    leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  was  such  that  it  was  not
    conducive to the public good.  The refusal stated:

         "We are satisfied that the decision to refuse your  client's  claim
         and seek your removal from  the  United  Kingdom  is  necessary  to
         protect the public safety and the economic wellbeing of the country
         and to prevent crime and disorder and provide effective immigration
         control.  For the reasons set out above your case falls for refusal
         under the suitability grounds as outlined in  the  new  Immigration
         Rules (specifically S-LTR.1.6)."

 6. The respondent also rejected the claim in respect  of  the  appellant's
    family life in the UK.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Mayall considered the  matter  and  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal on 30th June 2014.

 8. He recorded that the respondent had considered that the  appellant  was
    relying on the same reasons as the claim made in  2006  but  which  had
    been refused and had submitted no further  evidence  to  challenge  the
    findings of that refusal.  In the refusal letter the Secretary of State
    also considered whether there would  be  a  risk  upon  his  return  to
    Kinshasa Airport from the DRC authorities and the  respondent  referred
    to the Country of Origin Information Report for 2009 and 2011.  It  was
    noted by the judge at paragraph 14 that at paragraph 32  the  Secretary
    of State noted that contradictory claims which  continued  to  be  made
    about the issue of treatment of failed asylum seekers.  She referred to
    the country guidance case of BK (DRC) CG [2007] UKAIT 00098  and  noted
    that he had not claimed that his offences in the UK had  attracted  any
    significant level of publicity.  It was not accepted that the crimes of
    which he had been convicted would attract any adverse interest from the
    DRC government and there was no evidence that any of his  offences  had
    attracted any media attention in the UK or the DRC, and  the  Secretary
    of State did not therefore accept that he would be of interest  to  the
    DRC government and did not accept that he had a  well-founded  fear  of
    persecution if returned to the DRC.

 9. The judge recorded  from  paragraphs  24  to  42  the  history  of  the
    appellant's convictions and made reference to  the  appellant's  family
    life in the UK.  Submissions on behalf of the respondent were  recorded
    at paragraph 67 which stated that the appellant had committed seventeen
    offences in four and a half years and was currently in  the  prison  or
    immigration detention since his last offence.  It was submitted by  the
    respondent that BK was still valid country guidance and  had  not  been
    overtaken by recent events.

10. The judge also recorded that  the  appellant's  representative  at  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  confirmed  there  was  no  dispute  as   to   the
    appellant's credibility and he also accepted  that  BK  was  still  the
    current guidance.

11. The judge found that there was no evidence to suggest that the children
    of journalists, such as the appellant, had an objective  fear  of  ill-
    treatment in the DRC and the judge concluded at paragraph 82  that  the
    appellant would not be at risk of persecution should he be returned  to
    the DRC on account of his father's activities.  The judge recorded that
    both representatives accepted that  the  country  guidance  of  BK  was
    binding country guidance and in that case the  Tribunal  held  that  on
    return to the DRC failed asylum seekers do not per se face a real  risk
    of persecution or serious harm or treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR.

12. An application for permission to appeal was  made  by  the  appellant's
    representatives on the basis that R (On the Application Of P  (DRC))  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWHC  3879  (Admin)
    held at paragraph 44:

         "It is  clear  ...  that  the  position  with  regard  to  criminal
         deportees is significantly different from  that  of  failed  asylum
         seekers.   ...   The  position  of  criminal  deportees   was   not
         considered in BK (Failed asylum seekers)  DRC  (Rev  1)  CG  [2007]
         UKAIT 00098.  ...  Further, the following two propositions are  not
         seriously in dispute:

         i) First, that criminal deportees to  the  DRC,  if  identified  as
             such, will be detained on arrival for an indeterminate period.
              The DRC Ambassador's official statement makes the unequivocal
             statement that

                  'people who are being deported for having committed crimes
                  in the UK are held in custody for  a  period  of  time  to
                  allow  the  Congolese  justice  system  to  clarify  their
                  situation'."

    And:

         "...

         ii)      Second, such detention is likely to be in conditions which
             contravene Article 3 of the ECHR.  ...  prison  conditions  in
             the  DRC  are  severe  and  likely  to  reach  the  Article  3
             threshold."

13. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds  on  the
    basis that the position of those  convicted  of  criminal  offences  if
    identified as such will be detained on  arrival  for  an  indeterminate
    period.  And it was stated: "Whilst this was not a  point,  it  appears
    that was taken before the First-tier Tribunal, it is arguable that that
    is a matter relevant to the risk  on  return."   Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Reeds did not allow permission for the remainder of the grounds.

14. P referred to the case of someone who was a criminal deportee and there
    was a factual difference between that and this case.  The appellant  in
    this claimed that he was not a criminal and therefore  he  was  not  at
    risk even in the new country guidance.

15. The appellant had accepted that he was guilty of  criminal  convictions
    and indeed that is quite clear from his witness statements at paragraph
    9.

16. BK stated  that:

         "On return to the DRC failed asylum seekers do not per  se  face  a
         real risk of persecution or serious harm or treatment  contrary  to
         Article 3 ECHR.  In so finding this decision updates and  reaffirms
         existing country guidance."

    The First-tier Tribunal Judge identified that broadly the list of  risk
    categories identified in the earlier country  guidance  included  those
    perceived as being in opposition to the government.  AB  and  DM  (Risk
    categories  reviewed  -  Tutsis  added)  DRC  CG  [2005]  UKIAT   00118
    reiterated that there continued to be a real risk  for  those  with  an
    ethnic, political or military profile in opposition to  the  government
    and that each case was  to  be  judged  on  its  own  facts.  There  is
    reference to the effect that persons involuntarily returned or expelled
    from the UK to the DRC will not be seen as normal returnees,  paragraph
    188 BK, and that they will be questioned with a  view  to  establishing
    what type of expellee they are, "and in  particular  whether  they  are
    either a failed asylum seeker or a deportee" and  further  "in  certain
    contexts, as we have already had cause to see, it can be of  importance
    to   distinguish   between   different   categories   of    involuntary
    returnees/expellees)."  BK  did  not  specifically  address  the  issue
    though of criminal returnees and for example at paragraph 374, although
    it states:

         "To summarise, we consider that viewed as a whole  the  allegations
         regarding the ill-treatment of failed asylum seekers on  return  to
         N'Djili Airport on 27th February 2007  either  have  not  withstood
         closer scrutiny or remain unsubstantiated.  (It has  not  been  our
         purpose in this determination to analyse what will happen on return
         to persons who are not  mere  failed  asylum  seekers  but  have  a
         particular military or criminal history that is known, or is likely
         to become known, to the DRC authorities on return  -  e.g.  persons
         who are deserters or persons who have a criminal record or who  for
         other specific reasons may be on the  'wanted'  list  held  at  the
         airport.  However, we see  no  reason  to  take  a  different  view
         regarding such persons than that taken by previous Tribunal country
         guidance, which is essentially that  the  claims  of  such  persons
         would need to be looked at on a case by case basis.)"

17. An error of law was found because the judge appeared to accept that  BK
    applied without further consideration  and  he  did  not  consider  the
    evidence  that  suggested  from  the  Ambassador   de   la   R�publique
    D�mocratique du Congo  pr�s  le  Royaume-Uni  dated  16th  August  2012
    whereby the ambassador states:

         "Nevertheless people who are being deported  for  having  committed
         crimes in the UK are held in custody for a period of time to  allow
         the Congolese justice system to clarify their situation."

18. The background material including  the  U.S.  State  Department  Report
    dated 19th April 2013 recorded that conditions in most prisons remained
    severe and life-threatening. The matter was set aside only  in  respect
    of the risk of detention should he be returned.

Conclusions

19. I have set out some of the background of the Error of Law  decision  to
    contextualise the developments and to spell  out  the  limits  of  this
    decision.  The one issue on which permission was granted and which  the
    matter was set aside was in relation to  the  risk  on  return  of  the
    appellant bearing in mind the criminal profile of  the  appellant,  and
    the issue of his response should he be interrogated on  return  to  the
    airport. At the substantive hearing before me counsel agreed that there
    was one issue only, the issue of risk on return.

20. At [82] the First-tier Tribunal Judge recorded he was not satisfied and
    there no attempt was made  to  persuade  him  that  the  situation  had
    changed since BK and there would be  a  real  risk  of  persecution  or
    serious harm or ill treatment on the appellant's return.  This  is  the
    overall  conclusion  bar  the  consideration  of  the  impact  of   the
    appellant's criminality on his return which I address below.  The judge
    at [81] concluded that the appellant would not be at risk on account of
    his father's activities and there was no challenge to this.  There  was
    no objective evidence to suggest that children of  journalists  had  an
    objective fear of ill-treatment.  That was central to  the  appellant's
    claim.  The judge  in  the  decision  recorded  a  'deeply  disturbing'
    picture of the appellant's criminality and the appellant was unable  to
    dispute that criminal behaviour [84].

21. Mr Norton drew my attention to paragraphs 46 and  47  of  the  recently
    promulgated country guidance BM and Others (returnees  -  criminal  and
    non-criminal) DRC CG [2015] UKUT 00293 (IAC).  This recorded

          '46     Dr Kennes opines that, as regards returning nationals, the
         attention of the DRC  authorities  is  focused  on  those  who  are
         "currently perceived as a threat".  This will fluctuate,  according
         to changing circumstances.  If a person is  "specifically  targeted
         for judicial or for political reasons,  or  both",  detention  upon
         return is likely.  If  not,  liberty  will  be  guaranteed  by  the
         payment of a bribe.  DGM officials receive, identify and verify the
         travel tickets, identity papers and  resident's  permits  of  those
         arriving.  They work in tandem with the  ANR.  Bribery  is  to  the
         forefront of the officials' minds.  There is  no  evidence  of  ill
         treatment connected with questioning  at  the  airport.   Officials
         ascertain whether the name of the interviewee  is  on  "a  list  of
         persons wanted by the  Country's  Justice  or  Security  Services".
         This will include  those  who  were  prohibited  from  leaving  the
         country.  There is a further discrete group of those who used false
         documents when either leaving  or  entering  the  country,  thereby
         committing  an  offence  which  can   result   in   detention   and
         prosecution.   The  authorities  will  also  have  an  interest  in
         identifying any returning national who  had  escaped  from  prison.
         Persons who commit the offence of false testimony are also at  risk
         of prosecution.

         47 Dr Kennes also provides the example of a national who publicised
         state secrets and then fled abroad.  A further discrete group which
         he identifies is that of "trouble makers in Europe".  He gives  the
         further example of a participant  in  a  demonstration  abroad  who
         "..... uses violence, destroys property or  harms  other  persons":
         such persons are at risk of  prosecution  upon  returning  to  DRC.
         Another discrete group of persons at risk upon return are those who
         have engaged  in  attempted  or  actual  attacks  against  visiting
         Congolese Government officials, or others perceived  as  supporters
         of the Government, abroad.  In this context, the  author  describes
         the Congolese community in the United Kingdom as "very  active  and
         aggressive", without particulars.  Based on  this  unparticularised
         premise,  he  asserts  that  such  persons  are  "very   thoroughly
         interrogated"  upon  returning  to  DRC,  without  any   supporting
         evidence.   He  also  discloses  an  article  in  a   pro-Congolese
         Government  newspaper  suggesting  that  in  February  2011   armed
         assailants originating from the  Congolese  diaspora  attempted  to
         kill the Head of State.  Strikingly, Dr  Kennes  acknowledges  that
         this is the only example of its kind'.

22. Indeed all the appellants in that BM and Others (returnees)  relied  on
    Dr Kennes' evidence. The Tribunal placed limited weight on some  of  Dr
    Kennes evidence but had this to say about his evidence at paragraph 64

         'Furthermore, the Tribunal has no hesitation in  accepting  one  of
         the central themes of Dr Kennes' evidence, namely that the focus of
         the DRC authorities will be on persons who  are,  at  the  relevant
         moment in time, perceived to be a significant threat to the regime.
         However, one of the main weaknesses of the report is the absence of
         any evidence supporting the thesis that all,  or  certain,  foreign
         national offenders and  all,  or  certain,  failed  asylum  seekers
         belong to this broad category'.

23. There was no evidence that the crimes of which the appellant  had  been
    convicted in the United Kingdom would attract any adverse interest from
    the DRC government and there was no evidence that any of  his  offences
    had attracted any media attention in the UK or the DRC.

24. BM and Others (returnees) states as follows

         'A national of the Democratic Republic of  Congo  ("DRC")  who  has
         acquired the status of foreign  national  offender  in  the  United
         Kingdom is not, simply by virtue of such status, exposed to a  real
         risk of persecution or serious  harm  or  treatment  proscribed  by
         Article 3 ECHR in the event of enforced return to the DRC.

         A national of the DRC whose attempts to acquire refugee  status  in
         the United Kingdom have been unsuccessful  is  not,  without  more,
         exposed to a real risk of persecution or serious harm or proscribed
         treatment contrary to Article 3  ECHR  in  the  event  of  enforced
         return to DRC.

         A national of the DRC who has a  significant  and  visible  profile
         within APARECO (UK) is, in the event of returning to his country of
         origin, at real risk of persecution  for  a  Convention  reason  or
         serious harm or treatment proscribed by Article 3 ECHR by virtue of
         falling within one of the risk categories identified by  the  Upper
         Tribunal in MM (UDPS Members - Risk on Return) Democratic  Republic
         of Congo CG [2007] UKAIT 00023.  Those belonging to  this  category
         include persons who are, or are perceived to  be,  leaders,  office
         bearers or spokespersons.  As a general rule, mere  rank  and  file
         members are unlikely to fall within this  category.  However,  each
         case will be fact sensitive, with particular attention directed  to
         the likely knowledge and perceptions of DRC state agents.

         The DRC authorities have an interest in certain types of  convicted
         or suspected offenders, namely those  who  have  unexecuted  prison
         sentences in the DRC or in respect of  whom  there  are  unexecuted
         arrest warrants in the DRC or who allegedly committed  an  offence,
         such as document fraud, when departing the DRC.  Such  persons  are
         at real risk of imprisonment for lengthy  periods  and,  hence,  of
         treatment proscribed by Article 3 ECHR'.

25. This makes it clear that despite the appellant's status as an  offender
    in the United Kingdom this does not automatically expose him to a  risk
    of serious harm on return to the DRC. Nor does his  failed  attempt  to
    obtain asylum status. There was no evidence that  he  had  any  profile
    within APARECO (UK) (which is considered by the DRC government to be  a
    serious threat), let alone a significant and visible one.  There is  no
    evidence of an outstanding  arrest  warrant  or  an  unexecuted  prison
    sentence and indeed he came to the United Kingdom as  a  child  without
    claiming a history of offending in the DRC.

26. Miss Iqbal referred me to the expert report prepared by Mr A Ntung  and
    drew my attention to BM (false passport) DRC [2015] UKUT  00467  (IAC).
    At the head note BM (false passport) DRC confirms

         'The mere fact that an asylum claimant utilised a false passport or
         kindred document in departing the DRC will not without more  engage
         the  risk  category  specified  in  [119(iv)]  of  BM  and   Others
         (Returnees: Criminal and Non-Criminal) DRC CG [2015] 293 (IAC). The
         application of this  guidance  will  be  dependent  upon  the  fact
         sensitive  context  of  the  individual  case.  The  Tribunal  will
         consider, inter alia, the likely state  of  knowledge  of  the  DRC
         authorities pertaining to the person in question. A person claiming
         to belong to any of the risk categories will  not  be  at  risk  of
         persecution unless likely to come  to  the  attention  of  the  DRC
         authorities. Thus in every case there will be an intense  focus  on
         matters such as publicity, individual prominence, possession  of  a
         passport,  the  standard  emergency  travel  document  arrangements
         (where these apply) and how these matters impact on the  individual
         claimant.

27. The question regarding document fraud was also highlighted and Ms Iqbal
    submitted that it  was  completely  credible  that  the  appellant  had
    entered the United Kingdom on a false document as a child.  The  matter
    was adjourned twice following the finding on an error  of  law  in  the
    decision of Judge Mayall in order to allow for both cases in BM  to  be
    promulgated.  She submitted the risk was enhanced because the appellant
    had applied for a travel document, he had been absent from the DRC  for
    9 years and there would be an awareness of his ethnic background. These
    matters would be looked on suspiciously.

28. She also referred me to the expert report of Mr Alex M Ntung dated 28th
    September 2015.  Mr Ntung also  expressed  concerns  about  the  ethnic
    background of the appellant. What  he  did  say  was  this  'I  was  so
    concerned about his total lack of awareness of his  family  and  ethnic
    background'  and  'one  of  the  surest  ways  of  knowing  whether  an
    individual is a member of specific  (sic)  tribe  or  community  is  by
    examining his or her genealogy'.

29. In that report at [36] was this comment

         'When I asked him whether about his  ancestral  origin,  he  stated
         that he was not aware of this but he think that he  might  be  from
         the Bakongo ethnic group'.

    and at [43] it was reported

         'Mr Kisungu has demonstrated no awareness of his tribe link  beyond
         DRC borders or social and linguistic background of Bakongo  petiole
         in DRC.  He has demonstrated any (sic) understanding  of  realities
         surrounding conflict in DRC.  He has provided  no  knowledge  about
         his mother's family genealogy and her cultural identity'.

30. If the appellant does not know what his ethnic background is and cannot
    give details, I do not accept that Mr Ntung  can  ascribe  one  to  him
    based on 'their ancestry, namely the name of their father, grandfather,
    great-grandfather up to the tenth or more generation'.  That said,  the
    report identifies that there are 70 million people in the DRC and  over
    400 ethnic groups.  I do not accept that it has  been  shown  that  the
    appellant is at risk because of his ethnicity.

31. The skeleton argument of Ms  Iqbal  introduced  the  assertion  of  the
    vulnerability of the appellant to interrogation  because  as  Mr  Ntung
    stated  [79],  the  appellant  had  'no  awareness   of   the   social,
    geographical, cultural linguistic  and  political  background'.     The
    report consists  of  large  sections  of  general  background  history,
    surmise and unsubstantiated assertions and the value of this report  is
    limited in this regard and as an example, Mr Ntung's report  identified
    [60] that the appellant

         '... is culturally British, his history of  offences  and  criminal
         behaviour would be considered in DRC  as  'western  behaviour'  and
         'would make him discriminated and unwanted as local people  in  DRC
         ... perceive the western young adults as  lacking  moral  values'..
         'His history of offences  and  criminality  would  reinforce  these
         beliefs and  excluded  (sic)  him  socially,  which  influence  his
         economic survival'.

32. The appellant, however, lived in the DRC for 16 years until  his  entry
    to the United Kingdom in 2006.  I find therefore  that  he  would  have
    grounding  in  the  cultural,  social,  linguistic   and   geographical
    character of the DRC.  He is not interested in politics and bearing  in
    mind his extensive experience with the police authorities in the United
    Kingdom, I do not accept that he is rendered  particularly  vulnerable.
    He is also an adult healthy male. I repeat the issue in  this  case  is
    his liability to be detained by the authorities on  his  return  not  a
    rehearsal of all the issues.   I do not  find  that  he  is  unable  to
    return to the DRC and this appellant is at any real risk of persecution
    or other serious harm if now returned to the DRC. He has also confirmed
    to the expert that he had no media attention.  The expert asserted that
    he would not be returning with identity documents but he  has  in  fact
    applied for a Travel document.

33. I also note that the expert stated at [46] of his report that

         'having exited the country illegally isn't a serious issue  in  DRC
         as bribery and corruption is endemic and informal system is part of
         everyday life'.

    This contradicted his assertion at [49] that the appellant

         'having exited the  country  illegally  could  only  trigger  other
         investigation and questioning'.

34. I do not therefore find that the  mere  fact  that  the  appellant  has
    applied for a Travel document will attract the adverse attention of the
    authorities.  It is clear from  his  own  evidence  and  no  doubt  the
    evidence he has put forward when making the application for his  Travel
    document that he left the DRC 9 years ago and when he was a  child  and
    would not have had control over his own papers.  In relation to  travel
    documents BM and others (returnees)  found at paragraph 68 'AI  accepts
    these are 'for  administrative  purposes',  in  other  words,  for  the
    legitimate purpose of checking information without thereby  implying  a
    sinister motive that might lead to an individual being placed at risk'.



35. I repeat the finding above that he was not considered  to  be  at  risk
    because of his family and his ethnic background would not, either alone
    or cumulatively with the other information produced, expose  him  to  a
    risk from the authorities. This observation is reinforced by  the  lack
    of any political activity by the appellant within the  United  Kingdom.
    The factor of having a  criminal  record  in  the  United  Kingdom  for
    assault, disorderly behaviour, obstructing a  police  officer,  robbery
    and possession of drugs may be 'disturbing' as described by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Mayall but does  not  have  a  political  flavour.   His
    argument for  asylum  was  the  same  as  the  reasons  given  in  2006
    (connection with his father) and this  was  dismissed.   His  lifestyle
    revolved around petty offending, drug possession and robbery but he was
    not  a  political  member  of  APARECO  or  any  other  anti-government
    organisation in the time he has been in the United Kingdom. As  pointed
    out in a previous hearing this is not a  criminal  deportation  but  an
    administrative removal and on the basis of the case law  and  the  fact
    sensitive analysis I do not find the appellant  would  be  at  risk  on
    return.

36. The fact is that Judge Mayall found  no  evidence  that  the  appellant
    would be at risk because his father was a journalist and  this  finding
    has not  been  disturbed.  Although  the  expert  report  of  Mr  Ntung
    attempted to expand the consideration to the return  of  the  appellant
    overall because of his vulnerability, I do not  accept  that  the  case
    extends to revisiting the risk to the appellant overall but only to the
    risk to him because of his criminal record.  Even if that were not  the
    case I do not find he would be at risk for the reasons given above.

Order

The appeal is dismissed on Asylum, Humanitarian Protection and Human  Rights
Grounds.
