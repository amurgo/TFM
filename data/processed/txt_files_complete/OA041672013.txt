Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Khan, Counsel instructed by Khirri Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Hussain, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant was  born  on  15  October  1988  and  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.  He applied for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  which
    was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer on 28 November 2012.

2.   The essential issue is whether or not the  sponsor  could  satisfy  the
    financial requirements under ECP1.1(d) namely to earn a gross income of
    at least �18,600 as required by the Rules.

3.   Significantly there is no issue taken that  the  sponsor  does  not  in
    fact earn that amount.  Indeed  the  financial  documents,  which  were
    submitted to the Entry Clearance  Officer  and  which  are  before  me,
    indicate that her income is significantly in excess of that amount.

4.   The issue which was taken against the appellant by the Entry  Clearance
    Officer is that the documentation which was submitted was  not  in  the
    correct form as required by the Rules.

5.   The decision of 28 November 2012 is essentially in these terms:

         "Your sponsor is not exempt  from  the  financial  requirements  as
         defined by paragraph E-ECP.3.3.  I am not able to take into account
         any potential employment you have available to you in the UK or any
         offers of financial support from third parties.  In order  to  meet
         the financial requirements of the Rules your sponsor needs a  gross
         income of at least �18,500 per annum.


         You state on your Appendix 2 that your sponsor is employed by  Home
         Image and receives an annual gross income of �19,032.


         In respect of salary and employment in the UK, all of the following
         evidence (original documents) must be provided:


              The P60 for the relevant period or periods (if issued)

              Wage slips covering:

             (i)  A period of six months prior to the date  of  application
                  if the  applicant  has  been  employed  by  their  current
                  employer for at least six months or
             (ii)     A period of  twelve  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                  application if the applicant has been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for less than six months

              A letter from the employer confirming:-

              (i)      The person's employment and gross annual salary;
              (ii)     Length of their employment;
             (iii)    The period over which they have been   paid  or  were
                  paid the level of salary relied upon in  the  application,
                  and
               (iv)      The  type  of  employment  (permanent,  fixed  term
    contract or agency)
              (v)      a signed contract of employment
             (vi)     monthly personal bank statements corresponding to the
                  same period as the wage slips, showing that the salary has
                  been paid into an account in the name of the person or  in
                  the name of a person and their partner jointly.

         These documents are specified in the Immigration Rules in  Appendix
         FM-SE and must be provided.  You have not provided all the required
         documentation to demonstrate your sponsor's income is  as  claimed.
         I therefore refuse your application under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d)  of
         Appendix FM  of the Immigration Rules (E-ECP.3.1)."

6.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Parker on 12 February  2014.   On
    that occasion  the  sponsor  gave  evidence  and  adopted  her  witness
    statement of 12 February 2014.

7.   It was noted that there was a requirement for a contract of  employment
    and that as none was available as at the date of the application,  that
    could not satisfy the Rules.

8.   It was accepted that almost all the wage slips were produced  save  for
    one that was missing. It was said that although there were  P60s  there
    was no evidence that the salary is paid into the bank account until the
    end of July as prior to that the sponsor was paid in cash.

9.   Accordingly the Judge found that  the  Rules  were  not  satisfied  and
    upheld the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer.

10.  Grounds of appeal were submitted. Permission to appeal was  granted  by
    Judge Bartlett on 20 May 2014.  It was considered that  the  Judge  had
    materially erred in law by failing to apply the evidential  flexibility
    principles set out in paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE.  In particular  it
    was considered that the evidential  problems  faced  by  the  appellant
    could have been cured by paragraph D(d)(iii)(i),  paragraph  D(d)(iiii)
    and paragraph D(e) of Appendix FM-SE.

11.  I turn therefore to consider the  principles as set out in paragraph  D
    of Appendix FM-SE which provide as follows:

         "D(a) in deciding an application in relation to which this appendix
             states that specified documents must be  provided,  the  Entry
             Clearance Officer or the  Secretary  of  State  (the  decision
             maker) will consider documents that have been  submitted  with
             the application, and will only  consider  documents  submitted
             after the application where subparagraph (b) or (e) applies.

              (b)      If the appellant:

                       (i)      has submitted:

                      (aa)          a sequence of documents and some of the
                           documents in the  sequence  have  been  submitted
                           (e.g. if one bank statement from  the  series  is
                           missing):


                      (bb)     a document in the wrong format (for example,
                           if  a  letter  is  not  on  letterhead  paper  as
                           specified; or


                      (cc)     a  document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an
                           original document, or


                      (dd)          a document which does not  contain  all
                           the specified information; or

                       (ii)     has not submitted a specified document.

         The decision maker may contact the appellant or his representatives
         in writing or otherwise request  the  document(s)  or  the  correct
         version(s).  The material requested must be received at the address
         specified in the request within a reasonable time  scale  specified
         in the request.

         (c)  The decision maker will not request documents where he or  she
             does not anticipate that  addressing  the  error  or  omission
             referred to in subparagraph (b) will lead to a  grant  because
             the application will be refused for other reasons.

              (d)      If the appellant has submitted:

                  (i)  a document in the wrong format; or

                  (ii)     a document that  is   a  copy  not  the  original
    document, or

             (iii)    a document that does not contain  all  the  specified
                  information, but the  missing  information  is  verifiable
                  from:

                        (1)       other   documents   submitted   with   the
    application, when

                       (2) the website of the organisation which issued  the
    document, or

                       (3) the website of the appropriate regulatory body,

             The application may be granted  exceptionality  providing  the
             decision maker is satisfied that the documents(s)  so  genuine
             and that the application  meets all the requirements to  which
             the document relates. The decision maker reserves the right to
             request the  specific  original  document(s)  in  the  correct
             format in all cases where subparagraph  (b)  applies,  and  or
             refuse applications if this material is not  provided  as  set
             out in subparagraph (b).

         (e)  Where the decision maker is satisfied that there  is  a  valid
             reason why a specified document (s)  canto  be  supplied  e.g.
             because it is not issued in a particular country or  has  been
             permanently lost, he or she may  exercise  discretion  not  to
             apply the  requirement  for  the  document(s)  or  to  request
             alternative  or  additional  information  or  document(s)   be
             submitted by the applicant.


         (f)  Before making a decision under Appendix FM  or this  appendix,
             the  decision  maker  may  contact  the  applicant  or   their
             representative in writing  or  otherwise  to  request  further
             information  or documents.  The  material  requested  must  be
             received at the address specified  in  the  request  within  a
             reasonable timescale specified in the request."


12.  It is also relevant to bear in mind that in terms  of  the  flexibility
    paragraph 334 of the Rules.

13.  In terms of the wage slips there was but one  missing  and  it  was  in
    sequence.  As Mr Khan made clear, it was entirely possible from reading
    the payslips to see which one was missing because there is a cumulative
    total that was running at the same  time.  Thus  he  submits  that  the
    flexibility policy should have covered that matter.

14.  So far as the income that is to be paid in  the  bank  the  purpose  of
    that clearly is to ensure that the  money  claimed  is  in  fact  money
    received by the sponsor.  No issue has been taken that that is not  the
    case and indeed the nature of her earnings are adequately dealt with in
    the documentation that has been provided, particularly  the  cumulative
    nature of the P60s as well as the cumulative nature of the  wage  slips
    themselves.

15.  The major matter of concern both to  the  Judge  to  the  ECO  was  the
    absence of a contract of employment.  The  flexibility  policy  as  has
    been set out allows for documents to be received after the application,
    particularly  the  documents   which   complete   all   the   specified
    information.

16.  In that connection there was a letter from Home Image dated 7  February
    2014, which sets out fully the terms of the contract with the  sponsor,
    namely the company that she is employed with; that she is employed on a
     full-time basis working 40 hours every week through  the  2012-13  tax
    year.  Her remuneration rate is set  out  as  is  her  gross  earnings.
    There is confirmation that her net salary up to the  week  15  date  13
    July 2012 was paid to her as cash thereafter her salary was paid into a
    nominated account.  Full details are given as to her earnings and as to
    her salary and how it is paid to her.

17.  Mr Hussain, who represents the respondent, most fairly agreed that  the
    Rules do not specify the format of a contract of employment but  rather
    accepts that such a contract  will  contain  terms  and  conditions  of
    employment, salary and all relevant matters relating to it.   He fairly
    concedes that the letter of 7 February does precisely that and that  he
    has no objection to treating that in all  respects  as  a  contract  of
    employment for the purposes of satisfying the Rules.

18.  It is perhaps unnecessary to  go  into  any  great  detail  as  to  the
    documentation which has been submitted.  Mr Hussain  agrees   that  the
    nature of the flexibility policy as set out under Appendix FM are  such
    that the errors  which  the  documentation  highlighted  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer could have  been rectified without difficulty  had  a
    reasonable request to do so have been  made.

19.  There is no issue taken as to  the  earnings  of  the  sponsor  at  the
    material time of the application.  Mr Hussain fairly agrees that within
    the terms of the flexibility arrangements as set out in Appendix  FM-SE
    the deficiencies which were highlighted by the Judge were in  fact  not
    matters that presented an obstacle to the grant of  leave  and  to  the
    finding that in effect it was open to  the  appellant  to  produce  the
    missing documents and that in all  the  circumstances  the  Rules  were
    satisfied.

20.  In those circumstances I find that  the  Judge  was  in  error  in  the
    approach that  was taken, particularly failing  to  bear  in  mind  the
    flexibility provisions.  Thus the decision is set aside  to  be  remade
    having regard to all the documentation that has been  submitted and  to
    the submissions made and to the details as set out in  Appendix  FM-SE.
    I find that this appellant does satisfy all  the  requirements  of  the
    relevant Immigration Rule.

21.  In those circumstances  I  find  that  proper  documentation  has  been
    submitted to satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  I find
    therefore that the appellant satisfies those Rules such as to allow the
    appeal.

22.  In the circumstances therefore the appeal  before  the  Upper  Tribunal
    succeeds to the extent that the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge is set aside.  It is to be remade.  The appeal in respect of  the
    Immigration Rules is allowed.  That in respect of  Article  8  is  also
    allowed in line with those findings.
