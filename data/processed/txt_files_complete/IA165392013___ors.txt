                                 DIRECTIONS

  1. In so far as Upper Tribunal Judge Keki? gave  directions  orally  at  a
     hearing on 12 March 2014, those directions are superseded by these.


  2. The First-tier Tribunal was found to have made errors of  law  and  the
     determination was set aside in its entirety. Consequently, these  joint
     appeals are remitted for re-hearing afresh to the  First-tier  Tribunal
     for a decision to be made on all the issues.


  3. A date for hearing will be notified in due course.


  4. Any additional documentary evidence shall be served no later than  five
     working days prior  to  the  resumed  hearing.  The  documents  already
     submitted to the Tribunal remain on file and need not be re-served.
