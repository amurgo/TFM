                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms S Idelbi, Counsel instructed by Waterloo Legal
Advice Service


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The first respondent is a citizen of Brazil and her date  of  birth  is
    10 October 1973.  The respondent Kevelin  Fernandes  Da  Silva  is  the
    first respondent's son.  He is a citizen of  Brazil  and  his  date  of
    birth is 15 March 1997.  The respondent Karollyne Ketlen Silva  is  the
    first respondent's daughter.  She is a citizen of Brazil and  her  date
    of birth is 8 July 1998.  I shall refer to the first respondent as  the
    appellant as she was before the First-tier Tribunal.

2.   The appellant made an application for a residence card pursuant to  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  as  confirmation
    of a retained right of residence in the UK following her  divorce  from
    an EEA national.  Her application was refused by the Secretary of State
    in a decision dated 30  September  2013.   The  appellant  submitted  a
    decree absolute dated 9 August 2012 and it was accepted by the decision
    maker that her marriage was dissolved.  It was also accepted  that  the
    marriage had lasted for three years and one of those the couple resided
    in the UK.  It was also accepted that the EEA national was a  qualified
    person at the point of the divorce.  However, it was not accepted  that
    the appellant was a worker in accordance with  Regulation  10(6)(a)  of
    the 2006 Regulations.

3.   The appellant appealed against the decision and the appeal was  allowed
    by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Herbert  in  a  decision  that  was
    promulgated on 8 October 2014 following a hearing on 30 September 2014.
     Judge Herbert allowed the appeal under the 2006 Regulations.  He  made
    material findings at paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of the determination:


         "15. At the hearing before me I had the benefit of the  Appellant's
             bundle paginated pages 1  to  155.   Within  that  bundle  the
             submissions were outlined that there was overwhelming evidence
             that the Appellant did satisfy all the  material  requirements
             of  Regulation  10(6)  and  10(5)  and  therefore  as  clearly
             established he had a retained right of residence following the
             divorce.


         16.  I also had the benefit of  the  bank  statements  and  witness
             statement from the Appellants including  P60s  for  the  years
             2007/2008, 2009/2010 for the tax year ending 2012 and 2013 and
             further payslips with the matching National  Insurance  number
             as the P60 of  SJ749103D  saying  that  at  the  time  of  the
             application there were payslips from Crystal Cleaning Services
             from 23 December 2012 through each month of  February,  March,
             April, May, June,  July,  August,  September  and  October  to
             November showing that the Appellant  was  working  as  claimed
             throughout that period.


         17.  She was therefore exercising her treaty rights as if she  were
             an EEA national at the time of the application contrary to the
             assertion made by the Respondent."


4.   The Judge found that the first appellant was exercising  treaty  rights
    at the date of the application and that the application was made  on  8
    March 2013.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted by Judge McDade on 27  November  2014.
    The grounds seeking permission assert that the Judge  made  a  material
    misdirection of law because he failed to apply the decision in  Boodhoo
    and Another (EEA Regs: relevant evidence) [2013] UKUT 00346 (IAC) where
    the Tribunal found that the relevant date for an in country  appeal  in
    respect of the 2006 Regulations is the date of the  hearing.  Thus  the
    matter came before me.

6.   I heard oral submissions from Mr Walker, who maintained that  there  is
    an error of law, but conceded that it was not material in the light  of
    the credibility findings made by the Judge and the  evidence  contained
    in  the  appellant's  bundle  which  was  before  the  FtT  and   which
    establishes that the appellant was working as a  self-employed  cleaner
    at the date of the hearing  before  the  FtT  and  thus  satisfies  the
    requirements of the 2006 Regulations.

7.   The Judge made an error of law.  The decision that the appellant was  a
    worker at the date of the  application  is  a  lawful  and  sustainable
    decision but it was not the issue before him.  The  Judge  should  have
    considered the position at the date of the hearing.  However, the Judge
    found the appellant  to  be  credible  and  he  accepted  the  evidence
    contained in the appellant's witness bundle.  It is not clear from  the
    determination whether the appellant gave oral  evidence.   She  made  a
    full and detailed witness statement which was before the  FtT  and  her
    evidence is that she was employed  at  the  date  of  the  application.
    However, as a result of her immigration problem since the decision  her
    employment has been suspended.  She became self-employed on 1  December
    2013 and since then she has worked as a self-employed cleaner  and  she
    started  paying  national  insurance   contributions   directly.    The
    appellant submitted documents in support of this from HMRC and  letters
    from private individuals who employ her.

8.   The Judge accepted the appellant's evidence  which  was  that  she  was
    self-employed at the date of the hearing.  She  submitted  evidence  of
    this and it does not appear to have been challenged. In any  event,  Mr
    Walker conceded that in the light of this the error is not material and
    I agree with him. The appellant was at the relevant time (the  date  of
    the hearing before the FtT self-employed and satisfied the requirements
    of reg 10 (6) (a) of  the  2006  Regulations.  The  decision  of  Judge
    Herbert is maintained.

No anonymity direction is made.
