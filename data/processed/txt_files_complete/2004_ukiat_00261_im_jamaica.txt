Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr A Alhadi, Stevjeme and Company Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Hutton, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The appellant, a citizen  of  Jamaica,  appeals  with  leave  of  the
    Tribunal against the determination of an Adjudicator (Mr M J Gillespie)
    dismissing her appeal against the decision of the respondent made on 18
    November 2002 to make a deportation order  against  her  by  virtue  of
    Section 3(5) of the Immigration Act 1971.

2.    The appellant last entered the United Kingdom on 28 October 1998  and
    was granted six months leave to enter.  She failed to embark when  that
    leave expired.  On 24 May 1999 an asylum application  was  received  by
    the Home Office on the appellant's behalf.  A further application under
    the Regularisation Scheme for Overstayers  was  received  by  the  Home
    Office on 2 October 2000.  It is the refusal of that  application  that
    led to the appeal before the Adjudicator.

3.    On 26 November 2002 the appellant appealed against  the  respondent's
    decision on the following grounds:

      "The Secretary of State decision to make a deportation order  against
         the appellant will not be in  accordance  with  the  law  and  the
         Immigration Rules for the following reasons.

         [i]      The decision would be contrary to Section 9 of  the  1999
             Immigration and Asylum Act.


         [ii]     The appellant made an application to regularise her  stay
             in  the  United  Kingdom  in  which  she  has   a   legitimate
             expectation that she would be granted leave to  remain,  since
             her application meets the requirement to Section 9 of the 1999
             Immigration and Asylum Act.


         [iii]    Since there is no  ambiguity  in  the  interpretation  of
             Section 9,  to  the  1999  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act,  the
             appellant should have been given leave to remain.  And not  to
             be given a notice of a decision to make  a  deportation  order
             against her.


         [v]      Section 9 clearly states  overstayers  should  apply  for
             leave to remain, in  a  prescribed  manner.   The  manner  was
             prescribed in Regulation 2000, both Section 9 of the 1999  IAA
             and Regulation 2000, did give  an  indication  that  leave  to
             remain will be granted.


         [vi]     It was wrong for the Secretary of State to say by  virtue
             of Regulation 2000, that the appellant has a right  of  appeal
             when this Regulation only relates to the manner  in  which  an
             application has to be made within the meaning of Section 9  to
             the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act."

4.    The reason why we have quoted  the  grounds  of  appeal  in  full  is
    because Mr Alhadi virtually repeated the same arguments to us.

5.    The Adjudicator found that there was no merit in the submission  that
    the appellant has, under Section 9 of the Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    1999, a legitimate expectation that  she  will  be  afforded  leave  to
    remain if an application that meets the formal requirements of  Section
    9 is made.  Section 9 is purely  procedural  and  makes  no  provisions
    stating or enacting any  right  to  remain  for  overstayers  who  make
    application for regularisation.

6.    Mr Alhadi submitted a small  bundle  of  documents,  which  contained
    letters from the Home Office to Stevjeme and Co. Solicitors in  respect
    of applications made under the Regularisation Scheme for Overstayers on
    behalf of various clients.  In the letter the  Home  Office  said  that
    they had enclosed an "ICD.0009" to confirm that  the  client  had  been
    granted indefinite leave to remain and which explained  the  conditions
    of that leave and how to contact  the  Nationality  Directorate  should
    they wish to do so.  We did not know what an ICD.0009 was.   Mr  Alhadi
    tried to explain that the ICD.0009 was a letter, which  confirmed  that
    their application under the Regularisation Scheme  for  Overstayers  on
    behalf of each client had been accepted.  In order to confirm this,  we
    granted a short adjournment to Mr  Alhadi  to  produce  a  copy  of  an
    ICD.0009.

7.    At the resumed hearing Mr Alhadi produced an ICD.0009  letter,  which
    the Home Office had sent to one of his clients.  The letter stated that
    there were no longer any restrictions on  the  period  for  which  that
    person may remain in the United Kingdom and explained the conditions of
    that leave.  The letter did not specifically state the criteria used by
    the Home  Office  in  granting  indefinite  leave  to  that  particular
    claimant.

8.    Mr Alhadi relied on Section 9(i) of the Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    1999 which states:

         "[1]     During the regularisation period overstayers  may  apply,
             in the prescribed manner, for leave to remain."

9.    Mr Alhadi interpreted this to mean that once a valid application  was
    made under Section 9(1) in the manner prescribed  by  parliament,  that
    was conclusive evidence that an applicant would  be  granted  leave  to
    remain.  Therefore it was wrong of the Secretary of State to refuse the
    appellant's application and then issue a notice of intention to  deport
    her.  In our opinion this is an irrational argument.   In  our  opinion
    Section 9(1) enables an overstayer to make an application to regularise
    their stay during the regularisation period, which ran from 8  February
    2000  until  1  October  2000.     It  does  not,  as  stated  by   the
    Adjudicator, entitle a claimant to a legitimate expectation  that  they
    would be granted leave to remain.

10.   Mr Alhadi explained that the prescribed  manner  of  the  application
    envisaged in Section 9(1) is set out in the Statutory  Instrument  2000
    No.  265,  that  is,  The  Immigration   (Regularisation   Period   for
    Overstayers) Regulations 2000.  Section 2(1) says "an application under
    Section 9(1) of the  Act  shall  be  made  in  the  following  manner".
    Subsections (2) and (3) prescribe the manner in which  the  application
    should be made.

11.   Section 2(4) states:

            "The information referred to in paragraph (2) is:

         (a)      the applicant's full name, date of birth and nationality;


         (b)      the applicant's home address or  (if  none),  an  address
             where he may be contacted;


         (c)      the name and address of any representative who is  acting
             on behalf of the applicant;


         (d)      the date of each occasion on  which  leave  to  enter  or
             remain has been granted  to  the  applicant  since  his  first
             arrival in the United Kingdom, if known;


         (e)      in relation to each date  specified  in  accordance  with
             subparagraph (d), the period for which leave was  granted,  if
             known;


         (f)      the applicant's Home Office reference, if known;


         (g)      the fact that the application is made under Section 9  of
             the Act; and


         (h)      all the circumstances  which  the  applicant  wishes  the
             Secretary of State to take into account when  considering  his
             application, including:

             (i) his length of residence in the UK;


             (ii)      the strength of  his  connections  with  the  United
                  Kingdom;


             (iii)     his personal history, including  character,  conduct
                  and employment record;


             (iv)      his domestic circumstances; and


             (v) any compassionate circumstances."

12.   We note from the application made on the  appellant's  behalf  of  27
    September 2000 that only the factors set out in Section 2(4)(a)  -  (g)
    were put before the Secretary of State.  It is also clear to us in  his
    letter of 18 November 2002 responding to the  application  by  Stevjeme
    and Co. that the Secretary of State took into account the  factors  set
    out  at  Section  2(h)(i)  -  (v)  before  refusing   the   appellant's
    application to regularise her stay.  The appellant has  not  challenged
    the Secretary of State's reasons for  refusing  her  application.   The
    only challenge to the Secretary of State's decision appears to be based
    on the arguments in the grounds of appeal which mainly rely on  Section
    9 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  In our opinion that argument
    is irrational and has no basis in law.

13.   Accordingly, the appellant's appeal is dismissed.
