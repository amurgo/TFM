Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R A Rai, of Counsel instructed by Gills
Immigration Law
For the Respondent:    Ms Julie Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appeals, with permission, against a decision of Judge  of
    the First-tier  Tribunal  Suffield-Thompson  who,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 26 October 2017 dismissed the appeal  of  the  appellant
    against a decision of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  New  Delhi  who
    refused his application for  entry  clearance  as  an  adult  dependent
    relative.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of India,  born  on  5  May  1929.   He  had
    applied for entry clearance as a dependent  relative  of  his  son,  Mr
    Ranbir Baria, who has been settled in  Britain  for  many  years.   The
    appellant is a widower who is suffering from cerebral atrophy,  a  form
    of dementia, eyesight and hearing loss, and mobility  issues,  and  who
    has had spells in hospital because he was  not  eating  or  caring  for
    himself properly.  He has a maid to cook and clean for him but  it  was
    claimed that he is not able to wash, bath or dress himself.  Neighbours
    check on him.  The sponsor has visited India on many occasions spending
    time with his father, helping him with basic needs such as washing  and
    dressing.

3.   The judge set out her findings of fact in paragraphs 30  onwards.   She
    accepted that the appellant suffered from cerebral atrophy and had  had
    various stays in hospital and had had times when he was bedridden,  and
    that his wife had died of cancer in 2016.  She accepted that  financial
    assistance was provided for the appellant by the sponsor.

4.   She considered the issue of what care the  appellant  has.   She  found
    that the appellant  had  a  maid  who  cooked  and  cleaned,  and  that
    neighbours would also give some assistance and that  the  sponsor  gave
    money to the village elder and another friend in the  village  for  his
    father's needs.   The  judge  found  that  the  sponsor  had  not  been
    "entirely candid" with the Tribunal as to the level of care and support
    his father actually needed or has.

5.   The judge looked at an advertisement placed for carers by  the  sponsor
    and considered the level of care that was needed.  Her conclusion was:-

         "As I have already said it is, I find  either  the  case  that  the
         appellant has more help than the court were told about or  he  does
         not need the amount of care that the sponsor states.  I  find  this
         because the appellant has not been to India since February 2017  so
         it is apparent that despite the issues the appellant  has  and  the
         lack of care that the sponsor claims, he is managing to  take  care
         of himself with the help the sponsor says he has".

    With regard to the advert the judge stated:-

         "He (the sponsor) produced for the  court  an  advert  in  a  local
         Indian paper that he placed for a carer.  He produced the  original
         and it was dated May 2017.  I took great note of this date.  If the
         appellant were indeed struggling as badly as the sponsor says  then
         I would have expected him to place the advert immediately after the
         wife's death and not wait until a short while before  the  Tribunal
         hearing".

6.   The judge then considered  the  issue  of  care  homes  and  found  the
    sponsor had made no efforts at all to look into care homes on the basis
    that he said that the doctor had said there were no local ones and  the
    family should care for the  appellant.   She  added  that  she  had  no
    evidence before her that care homes were not affordable  in  India  and
    that as the sponsor and his wife had a  joint  income  of  ï¿½50,000  and
    owned a six bedroomed house, she found that they had ample funds to pay
    for the sponsor to have care in India.

7.   The judge then went on to look at medical  evidence.  She  stated  that
    the note from the appellant's general practitioner was  brief,  without
    details of all the appellant's ailments and  was  not  a  comprehensive
    medical report and     gave no details as to how long  the  doctor  had
    known  the  appellant  for,  his  various  conditions   or   his   home
    circumstances, and noted moreover that the doctor had made  no  mention
    of the possibility of carers at home or nursing homes.  She concluded:-

         "I cannot give this letter much evidential weight as  it  gives  so
         few details about the appellant and his health.  The  sponsor  told
         the Tribunal his father is going blind and deaf and yet  I  had  no
         evidence before me of either of these conditions.  He also said  he
         is losing his mobility, which at his age may well be the  case  but
         again I had no medical evidence before me to confirm this".

8.   The judge concluded that the appellant did not  meet  the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules - that finding was not contested before me.

9.   In paragraphs 45 onwards the judge set out the structured  approach  in
    the judgment in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 to the issue of  the  appellant's
    rights under the ECHR.  She noted that the sponsor had lived in Britain
    for 45 years but accepted that he was an only child and said that there
    had been continuous contact.  The judge concluded that there was family
    life in existence.

10.  Having referred  to  the  case  of  MM  (Article  8  -  family  life  -
    dependency) Zambia [2007] UKAIT 00040 and the judgment of the Court  of
    Appeal in Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31  the  judge  concluded  that  the
    appellant and the sponsor had a relationship which goes over and  above
    that which is normal for an adult child and parent.

11.  The judge then went  on  to  consider  the  issue  of  proportionality,
    applying the decision in Mustafa (Article 8 in entry clearance)  [2015]
    UKUT 00112 (IAC).  The judge felt that although there was an element of
    dependency,  both  financial,  practical  and  emotional,  between  the
    appellant and the sponsor it was appropriate to give  great  weight  to
    Section 117B(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act.   She
    noted the appellant did not speak any English and  considered  that  he
    would not integrate into UK society due to his dementia.  She  went  on
    to say that although the sponsor had said that  he  could  support  his
    father, the appellant had complex medical needs and it  was  inevitable
    that he would become a person who will need enormous input from the NHS
    which then has an impact on the availability  of  services  to  British
    residents and taxpayers.  She stated that she had found that there  was
    care available in India that could be paid for  by  the  sponsor  which
    would be adequate for the appellant at this stage  in  his  life.   She
    referred to the  importance  of  protecting  the  economic  welfare  of
    Britain including the impact on the NHS and  social  care  and  medical
    services and stated that having weighed up all the evidence the balance
    came  down  in  favour  of  the  state's  legitimate  aim  to   control
    immigration and to protect the economic welfare  of  Britain  and  that
    therefore there was no breach of the appellant's or sponsor's Article 8
    rights.  She therefore dismissed the appeal.

12.  An application for permission was made which referred to the  facts  as
    found by the judge and made the assertion that the judge was  wrong  to
    assume that the applicant would require medical treatment under the NHS
    as he had received private medical treatment  when  he  had  previously
    been in Britain. The judge, it was argued, had failed to  consider  the
    effects of removal on the human rights "of the applicant and her family
    members in the UK between whom the judge accepted were close  emotional
    ties".  They argued that the judge  had  not  properly  considered  the
    issue  of  proportionality.   Upper  Tribunal   Judge   Keki?   granted
    permission stating that the judge had failed to consider the  sponsor's
    evidence that he would pay for  his  father's  treatment  privately  if
    required, and had not properly considered the burden on the sponsor and
    his family of having to make regular extended trips to India.

13.  A Rule 24 notice stated that the judge reached conclusions  which  were
    open to her on the evidence.

14.  In his submissions Mr Rai stated that the judge, having found that  the
    appellant and the sponsor were exercising  family  life  and  that  the
    appellant  was  dependent  on  the  sponsor,  had  been   wrong,   when
    considering the issue of proportionality, to place weight on  the  fact
    that the appellant could  not  speak  English  and  to  find  that  the
    appellant's medical needs would be an undue  burden  on  the  NHS.   He
    argued that it was irrelevant given the appellant's mental health as to
    whether or not he could integrate into  Britain,  and  furthermore  the
    judge had erred in not assessing the impact on the sponsor  who  had  a
    business here and a life in Britain.  These, he argued,  were  material
    errors of law.

15.  Ms Isherwood argued that there was  no  material  error  of  law.   She
    relied on the judgment of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Ribeli  v  Entry
    Clearance Officer,  Pretoria  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  611  which  reached  a
    conclusion that the Upper Tribunal had been  correct  to  set  aside  a
    determination of a judge in the First-tier Tribunal who had allowed  an
    appeal under the Rules and  therefore  not  gone  on  to  consider  the
    Article 8 rights of that appellant, and  upheld  the  decision  in  the
    Upper Tribunal judge, finding that the  Upper Tribunal  Judge,  in  re-
    making the appeal had considered the appellant's "unmet needs" and that
    there was no evidence that suitable care  was  not  available  in  that
    appellant's home country.  The Court of Appeal found that the judge had
    been correct to dismiss the appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    emphasised that the burden lay  on  the  appellant  to  show  that  she
    qualified for entry clearance.   With  regard  to  the  rights  of  the
    appellant in that case under Article 8 the Court of Appeal  emphasised,
    at paragraph 67, that the test under Article 8 was an objective one and
    that as that appellant's daughter could reasonably be  expected  to  go
    back to the appellant's own country to provide  the  emotional  support
    and practical support needed and that there  was  no  reason  why  that
    sponsor could not live and work in  the  appellant's  home  country  to
    supervise arrangements made for the appellant, the Upper  Tribunal  had
    been correct to dismiss the appeal on Article 8 grounds. The  Court  of
    Appeal t emphasised that the  case  was  about  the  choice  which  the
    sponsor had exercised and wished to be able to continue to exercise, of
    living in Britain rather than in the appellant's country of origin, and
    said that "in those circumstances the Upper Tribunal cannot be  faulted
    for having come to  the  conclusion  that  any  interference  with  the
    appellant's right to respect for family life conforms to the  principle
    of proportionality".

16.  Ms Isherwood went on to emphasise that weight should be  given  to  the
    fact that the appellant could not meet the  Rules  and  the  acceptance
    that the sponsor had not looked at care facilities for his father.  She
    referred to the delay in placing  the  advertisement  for  carers,  and
    stated that in fact the conclusions of the judge regarding the  medical
    evidence was not challenged.  In these circumstances  she  argued  that
    there was no error of law in the determination of the judge.

17.  Mr Rai emphasised again the rights of the sponsor.

Discussion

18.  I consider that there is no material error of law in the  determination
    of the First-tier Judge.  She properly did consider  all  the  relevant
    factors and reached a conclusion which was fully open to  her  thereon.
    Following the judgment in Ribeli the reality is that although it  would
    be inconvenient for the sponsor to live in  India,  that  is  obviously
    something which he could do should he wish to personally care  for  his
    father.  Moreover, the appellant's life is clearly bound  up  with  his
    life in his own surroundings with family friends and indeed he has  the
    help of the local headman and other friends there. I would add that the
    sponsor's income would not necessarily be ab sufficient to  look  after
    his father in hospital here.   I consider  that  the  judgment  of  the
    First-tier Judge was fully  open  to  her  and  indeed,  following  the
    determination of the Court of Appeal in Mukarkar  [2006]  EWCA  Civ,  I
    consider that it would  be  incorrect  to  upset  that  decision.   The
    decision was reached having applied the  correct  test  and  the  judge
    properly placed weight on the fact that the appellant  could  not  meet
    the requirements of the Rules.

19.  I therefore find that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal and I therefore  dismiss  this
    appeal.

20.  No anonymity direction is made.
