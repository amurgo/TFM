                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo born  on
    9th July 1982.

 2. She appealed against refusal of asylum and her appeal was dismissed  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal McDade in a  determination  dated  3rd
    February 2014.  The basis of the  Appellant's  claim  arises  from  her
    claimed  involvement  with  a   NGO   named   Clinique   Internationale
    Humanitaire.  This  is  an  organisation  which  worked  with  homeless
    orphans.  The Appellant claims that in October 2012 she  wrote  to  the
    government objecting to the practice of asking  children  to  join  the
    army.  A few days she  later  she  claims  that  she  was  arrested  by
    uniformed security service officers and taken to a military base  where
    she was interrogated and tortured.  She claims to have been  raped  and
    stabbed in the top of her legs and  deprived  of  food  and  drink  for
    fourteen days.

 3. The Appellant claims that she managed to escape when an officer of  the
    same ethnicity as the Appellant took pity on her and arranged  for  her
    to travel by boat to Brazzaville.   An  agent  then  arranged  for  the
    Appellant's journey to the UK using a French passport.

 4. Her claim was refused by the Respondent as lacking in credibility.   An
    adverse  inference  was  drawn  under  Section  8  of  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 on the  basis  that
    the Appellant did not make contact with the UK authorities  on  arrival
    and did not claim asylum until four days later.

 5. The Appellant's  appeal  was  dismissed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal McDade in a determination which is short  but  robust.   Judge
    McDade dismissed the Appellant's asylum claim as neither plausible  nor
    credible.  Her appeal under Article 8 was considered under  the  Razgar
    guidance  but  dismissed  on  the   basis   that   the   decision   was
    proportionate.

 6. An application for permission to appeal was refused in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Simpson  who  described  Judge
    McDade's determination as  careful  and  well  reasoned.   The  judge's
    adverse comments were described as fair and reasonable.

 7. A renewed application to the Upper Tribunal for permission was  granted
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley.  Judge Chalkley  points  out  in  his
    reasons for decision that  nowhere  in  the  determination  does  Judge
    McDade set out a brief pr�cis or summary of the Appellant's claim or of
    her oral evidence.  As a result it is almost  impossible  to  determine
    that he has made adequate findings of fact.  Judge Chalkley  considered
    that it was properly arguable that Judge McDade may have erred  in  law
    by failing to give any or any adequate reasons  for  finding  that  the
    Appellant's account of rape was not credible.  The fact that no medical
    evidence had been adduced does not mean that a judge does not  have  to
    assess the Appellant's oral evidence.  Further, it was considered  that
    inadequate reasons had been given for the First-tier Judge's conclusion
    that he did not believe that the  Appellant  would  not  have  been  in
    contact with her family.

 8. The Appellant's representative served a Rule 24 response dated 9th  May
    2014.  The  response  acknowledges  that  the  determination  lacks  in
    detailing the Appellant's basis of claim and lacks  a  fluid  structure
    such as one  would  normally  expect  to  see  in  all  determinations.
    Nevertheless,  looking  at  the  determination  holistically,   it   is
    submitted that notwithstanding these "minor structural errors"  in  the
    determination the decision is reasonable and  sustainable  and  in  the
    light of the adverse credibility  findings  it  is  submitted  that  no
    reasonable  alternatively  constituted  Tribunal  could  possibly  have
    arrived at a materially different outcome.

 9. A reply pursuant to Rule 25 dated 11th June 2014 has been drafted by Mr
    Lane, on  behalf  of  the  Appellant.   Contrary  to  the  Respondent's
    response, it is argued that the deficiencies in the First-tier  Judge's
    determination go far beyond minor structural errors and strike  at  the
    core of why the Tribunal is expected to give reasons.  In  summary,  it
    is submitted that the determination is so deficient in  reasoning  that
    it amounts to a failure to give reasons at all.

10. Thus the matter came before me in the Upper Tribunal on 25th June  2014
    for an error  of  law  hearing.   The  Appellant  was  present  but  no
    interpreter had been provided, in accordance with the Upper  Tribunal's
    standard directions.  No request for an interpreter had  been  made  by
    the Appellant's representative.  It was apparent that the Appellant had
    very little understanding of English but Mr Lane indicated that he  was
    content to proceed with the error of law stage  and  did  not  consider
    that the Appellant would be prejudiced by  the  absence  of  a  Lingala
    interpreter.

11. In submissions, Mr Lane relied upon the original grounds in support  of
    the application for permission to appeal, a skeleton argument submitted
    for the error of law hearing and the Rule 25 reply.  The reply  submits
    that -

       . No findings of fact were made as  to  whether  the  NGO  which  the
         Appellant claimed to have  worked  for  existed  and  there  is  no
         explanation as to why no findings of fact could be made.

       . The First-tier Judge placed  too  much  reliance  on  the  lack  of
         medical evidence in relation to the alleged rape and dismissed  the
         Appellant's account without making any assessment of her  oral  and
         written evidence despite her case being internally  consistent  and
         consistent with the objective evidence.

       . There was no evidence at all to justify the findings arrived at  as
         to the failure to claim asylum immediately upon arrival.

       . There were no adequate reasons for finding that the Appellant is in
         contact with her family in the DRC.

12. For the Respondent, Mr McVeety accepted that this is, as he put it,  an
    unusual determination, but nevertheless relied  upon  the  Respondent's
    Rule 24 response and invited me to conclude that the determination  was
    adequate.

13. In my view this is an unusually short determination for  a  DRC  asylum
    claim of this nature.  Brevity is a commendable quality but it must not
    be at the expense of or in substitution for adequate reasoning.

14. I respectfully share Upper Tribunal Chalkley's concern that nowhere  in
    the determination does the First-tier Judge set out even a brief pr�cis
    or summary of the Appellant's claim or of  her  oral  evidence.   As  a
    result,  the  reader  knows  nothing  about  the  background   to   the
    Appellant's asylum claim and in such circumstances it is difficult,  if
    not impossible, to decide whether reasons given are adequate or not.

15. Background evidence clearly demonstrates that the DRC is a  potentially
    dangerous  country  where  serious  human  rights   abuses   often   go
    unpunished.  It is also  a  well  established  principle  that  adverse
    credibility findings must only be made after the most careful  scrutiny
    of the Appellant's case and adequate reasons must be given  in  support
    of such findings.  That, I regret to say, is not demonstrated  in  this
    instance.

16. In support of her appeal, the Appellant relied  upon  a  report  by  an
    expert witness who could find no trace of the NGO for which she claimed
    to have worked.  The determination records that the  expert  tried  but
    failed to find any record of this organisation, which according to  the
    Appellant had nine people working for it.  The expert  can  merely  say
    that there are many organisations in the DRC that are unregistered  and
    local in nature and the fact that they  cannot  be  found  through  the
    internet does not mean that they do not exist.   The  expert  expresses
    the view that the name of the  organisation  sounds  plausible  in  the
    light of the work they are said to be  undertaking.   So  far  as  this
    aspect of the evidence  is  concerned,  I  agree  with  Judge  McDade's
    conclusion  that  whilst  the  absence  of  evidence   regarding   this
    organisation is not in itself adverse to the Appellant's  claim  it  is
    not of assistance either.  It merely does nothing to advance the  case.



17. However, so far as other findings are concerned, I agree with Mr Lane's
    submission that no reasons or inadequate reasons have been given.

18. The Appellant also has a child born in the United Kingdom.  At the date
    of the First-tier Tribunal hearing the Appellant's baby  was  2  months
    old.  He is now 6 months and the Appellant brought him with her to  the
    hearing before me because she said that she had no one to  assist  with
    childcare.  Reference is made to the Appellant's baby at paragraph 7 of
    the determination but the judge merely concludes that the Appellant and
    her child would  be  returned  together  and  that  family  life  would
    continue as before.  This, in my view, is not enough to  discharge  the
    Tribunal's duty under  Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009.  The Appellant's situation as a single woman with
    a dependant child returning to the DRC  should  have  been  given  more
    detailed consideration.

19. Having given brief oral reasons for my  decision  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's determination disclosed a material error of law by virtue of
    inadequate reasoning, I directed that it should  be  set  aside.   Both
    representatives invited me  to  remit  the  matter  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a fresh hearing before a different judge.  Having reminded
    myself of the requirements of  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    Practice Statement, I am satisfied that this is the appropriate course.
     I am also satisfied that it would be inappropriate to preserve any  of
    the findings made by the First-tier Tribunal.  The matter needs  to  be
    heard afresh.

DECISION

I set aside the First-tier Tribunal's determination and give  the  following
directions.

DIRECTIONS

 1. There shall be a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal at the Stoke-
    on-Trent Hearing Centre on the first available date.


 2. No findings of fact are preserved.

 3. A Lingala interpreter shall be provided by the Tribunal.

 4. The hearing shall be before a salaried judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    other than Judge McDade.

Anonymity

No anonymity direction is made
