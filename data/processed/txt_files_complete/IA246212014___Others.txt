For the Appellants:    Mr S Vokes, instructed by Stephen & Richard
Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer




                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellants'  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Asjad  promulgated  5.5.15,  dismissing  their  linked
    appeals against the decisions of the Secretary of State, dated 23.5.14,
    to refuse their applications for leave to remain in the UK on the basis
    of private and family life.  The Judge heard the appeal on 13.4.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Fisher  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    8.10.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun granted permission  to  appeal  on
    10.11.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 19.2.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below, I found such error of law in the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to  require  decision  of
    Judge Asjad to be set aside and remade by remitting the decision in the
    appeals to the First-tier Tribunal  in  accordance  with  the  attached
    directions.

 5. In essence, the grounds of application for permission to  appeal  argue
    that (1) the First-tier Tribunal Judge formed a negative  view  of  the
    first appellant's credibility at �8 before considering  all  the  other
    evidence in the case, including the expert evidence; and (2)  that  the
    judge failed to give adequate consideration to that expert evidence.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Eshun considered that  all  the
    grounds disclose an arguable error of law.

 7. The Rule 24 response, dated 2.12.15, submits  that  taking  a  holistic
    approach to the findings and reading the decision  as  a  whole  it  is
    clear that the finding as to the first appellant's credibility at �8 is
    a culmination of the evidence before the Tribunal, and that Judge Asjad
    was entitled to conclude that  the  first  appellant  was  an  economic
    migrant, given the assessment and summary of her oral evidence.

 8. The Secretary of State also submits  that  the  judge  gave  sufficient
    consideration to the psychological report by Dr Latif between  �19  and
    �21 of the decision and was entitled to distinguish  the  expert  as  a
    psychologist and not a psychiatrist and to  note  that  the  appellants
    have not received any medical treatment for any mental illness. In  the
    circumstances, the judge was entitled to conclude that the  report  was
    of limited relevance.

 9. In summary, it is submitted  that  the  grounds  are  no  more  than  a
    disagreement with the adverse outcome of the appeal and that the  judge
    had considered all the available evidence and reached a conclusion open
    to her on that evidence and thus that no error of law is disclosed.

10. The cases of Mibanga v SSHD [2005] EWCA  Civ  367  and  Malaba  v  SSHD
    [2006] EWCA Civ 820 were cited to me in submissions, and which  I  have
    carefully considered. I was  also  assisted  by  the  careful  skeleton
    argument of Mr Vokes, dated 16.2.16.

11. Mr Tufan agreed with Mr Vokes that the structure of the decision of the
    First-tier  Tribunal  was  rather  unusual.  There  appears  to  be  no
    assessment of the oral evidence or submissions and it is not clear what
    the judge understood the appellants' case at appeal to be.   After  the
    heading 'Issue Under Appeal and Relevant Law' the judge  went  straight
    to her findings, dealing with each  appellant  in  turn.  There  is  no
    indication, as often appears at the beginning of a  decision  that  the
    judge has considered all of the evidence in the round  or  as  a  whole
    before making any of the findings in the case.

12. Under the heading 'My Findings: The First appellant,' the  judge  first
    summarised the immigration history at �7, but immediately thereafter at
    �8 stated, "There is little doubt in my mind that the  First  appellant
    is an economic migrant who came to the  UK  for  the  sole  purpose  of
    establishing a life for herself and her children. In doing so  she  has
    systematically and intentionally abused the UK Tax System  -  receiving
    free treatment under the NHS and free education for her children - none
    of which she was entitled  to."  The  judge  did  not  state  that  the
    findings are based on the reasons 'set out below,' or some  other  form
    of similar expression or explanation to help all parties to the  appeal
    understand on what basis and in particular on what evidence  the  judge
    reached the conclusions she did.

13. It is correct that thereafter, between �8 and �12  the  judge  drew  on
    certain aspects of the oral evidence of  the  first  appellant,  before
    restating the conclusion at �13 that she is  an  economic  migrant  who
    came to the UK with the intention  of  living  here.  "She  ahs  worked
    illegally in the UK, established a Company and paid no tax and she  has
    failed to mention her Immigration Status  to  Educational  and  Medical
    establishments."

14. I find that Mr Vokes is correct to point out that  the  judge  has  not
    made it clear that all the evidence has been considered before reaching
    the credibility findings in relation to the first  appellant.  Further,
    the way in which the decision is set out, it  appears  that  the  judge
    made her findings about the first appellant before considering the case
    and circumstances of the second and  third  appellants.  As  stated  in
    Mibanga, it is "axiomatic that a fact-finder must not reach his or  her
    conclusion before surveying all the evidence relevant thereto."  It  is
    not necessary for a judge to set out all of the evidence,  or  even  of
    the submissions made by the parties, but the factual context in which a
    finding or conclusion has been reached must be clear. I find  that  the
    way in which the decision is structured makes it  unclear  whether  the
    judge has made a fair and  balanced  assessment  of  all  the  evidence
    before reaching  rather  trenchant  views  as  to  the  motivation  and
    credibility of the first appellant. It would have been possible  for  a
    judge to reach the same conclusion after  having  conducted  a  careful
    assessment of the evidence, but the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    fails to provide such an  assurance,  and  in  the  circumstances  this
    failure amounts to an error of law.

15. Further, as also stated in Mibanga, it is an error of law  to  reach  a
    conclusion by reference only to an appellant's evidence and then, if it
    be negative, to ask whether that conclusion should be  shifted  by  the
    expert evidence. Where an expert report is relevant to credibility, the
    judge should deal with it as  an  integral  part  of  the  findings  on
    credibility rather than as an add-on. Mr  Vokes  points  out  that  the
    judge appears to have dealt with the expert report  discretely  between
    �19 and �21, after having already made findings in relation to each  of
    the three appellants. The judge found it relevant that neither  of  the
    child appellants had received any mental health treatment and  that  no
    outside agencies had been concerned as to their welfare.  However,  the
    report was not relied on in respect of the mental or physical health of
    the child appellants, but  rather  in  relation  to  the  psychological
    effect on the children of being removed from the UK in their particular
    circumstances. The judge does not  address  any  other  aspect  of  the
    report. In the circumstances, I find force in Mr Vokes submission  that
    the reasoning for finding the report of limited relevance  is  entirely
    inadequate and as such amounts to an error of law.

16. In all the circumstances, there are such errors of law in the making of
    the decision that require it to be set aside.

17. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

18. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision in the appeals to the
                    First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

20. The decision in the  linked  appeals  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal at Birmingham, to be made afresh  with  no  findings  of  fact
    preserved;

21. The estimated length of hearing is 2 hours;

22. An interpreter in Mandarin Chinese will be required;

23. Not later than 14 working days before the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal
    hearing the appellants shall serve on the respondent and lodge with the
    Tribunal a consolidated, indexed and paginated bundle of all subjective
    and objective material to be relied  on,  together  with  any  skeleton
    argument to be advance. The Tribunal will not accept documents supplied
    on the day of the hearing.



Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an order. Given the circumstances, I  continue  the  anonymity
order.



Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeals, remain to be decided.
