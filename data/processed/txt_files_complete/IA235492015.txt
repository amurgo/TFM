Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N O'Brien, Counsel instructed by Elthorne
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or
    a Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or  any  form
    of publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings. I do so in order to avoid  a  likelihood
    of serious harm arising to the appellant's child.

 2. This is an appeal against the decision promulgated on 15 February  2017
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Coll which refused the long residence  and
    Article 8 appeal of the appellant.

    Background

 3. The background to this matter is as follows. The appellant claims  that
    he entered the UK on 8  August  1997  but  this  is  in  dispute.   The
    appellant appears to have entered illegally and does not appear to have
    ever had leave. On 5 July 2012 he applied for leave to remain in the UK
    on the basis of fourteen years'  long  residence.   The  date  of  that
    application and transitional provisions mean that he was (and still is)
    entitled to have his  claim  on  the  basis  of  fourteen  years'  long
    residence considered. The application was first  refused  on  17  March
    2014. A judicial review  led  to  the  respondent  accepting  that  the
    appellant was entitled to consideration under the old Immigration Rules
    and the further decision of 9 June 2015 led to the appeal here.

 4. As well his long residence and private  life  claim,  the  appeal  also
    concerns the appellant's family life with his  daughter,  AY.  After  a
    brief relationship with another Indian national, SK, AY was born in the
    UK in 2013. Her mother, SK had entered the UK with entry clearance as a
    student on 6 February 2007 and obtained extensions of leave thereafter.
     Her leave was curtailed as  of  28  August  2012  and  she  became  an
    overstayer. She was served on 19 August 2014 with notice  of  liability
    to removal because of the respondent's view that she had  attempted  to
    obtain leave to remain by  deception  on  the  basis  of  an  ETS/TOEIC
    certificate from an application made in 2012.  She has challenged  that
    decision by way of judicial review and  at  the  time  of  the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal her case was pending  in  the  Court  of
    Appeal.

 5. Also relevant to the appellant's Article 8  claim  is  his  history  of
    criminal offending in the UK.  It is undisputed that the appellant  had
    two convictions for motoring offences from 2011  and  2012,  driving  a
    motor vehicle with excess alcohol and driving whilst  disqualified  and
    using a vehicle whilst uninsured.  He received  penalties  including  a
    custodial sentence of fifteen weeks.  He had again  been  convicted  in
    September 2016 of driving a motor vehicle with excess  alcohol  and  of
    using a vehicle whilst uninsured  and  of  driving  otherwise  than  in
    accordance with the licence.  By way of sentence, he  was  disqualified
    from driving for 52 months and fined �335.

First-tier Tribunal decision

 6. Before the First-tier Tribunal it was conceded that the appellant could
    not meet the provisions of Appendix FM; see [55].  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Coll did not accept that the appellant had been resident  in  the
    UK for 14 years as of the date of his application so refused  the  long
    residence appeal under paragraph 276B; see [37]-[53]. He did  not  find
    paragraph 276ADE was met as the appellant could not show  very  serious
    obstacles to reintegration; see [57]-[58]. He did  not  find  that  the
    decision amounted to a breach of Article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration
    Rules; see [59]-[74].

    Discussion

    Challenge to the refusal to adjourn

 7. I consider first the appellant's challenge to the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal not  to  adjourn.  This  is  contained  in  ground  4  at
    paragraphs 26-30 of the grounds of appeal.

 8. The context to the adjournment application made to Judge  Coll  at  the
    hearing on 31 January 2017 was that an application for  an  adjournment
    had previously been  made  on  19  August  2016.  In  support  of  that
    application, a letter from the appellant's GP,  Dr  GS.  As  the  judge
    noted at [18] this adjournment application was granted  and  a  hearing
    listed for 25 August 2016 re-listed for 31 January 2017.

 9. Further, prior to the hearing on 31 January 2017, another  letter  from
    Dr GS dated 13 January 2017 was provided to the Tribunal on 16  January
    2017 and formed the basis of a  further  adjournment  application.  The
    second adjournment application was refused on  18  January  2017  by  a
    Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal stating:

         "None of these issues are such as to warrant adjourning the  appeal
         particularly bearing in mind that it  has  already  been  adjourned
         from August 2016."

10. The appellant did not attend the hearing on 31 January 2017.  His legal
    representative renewed the  adjournment  application,  relying  on  the
    letter of 13  January  2017  from  Dr  GS  and  also  evidence  of  the
    appellant's history of involvement  with  mental  health  services.  Mr
    O'Brien's submissions in support of the adjournment are set out at [20]-
    [21] of the decision and at [22] the decision  records  that  the  Home
    Office Presenting Officer on the day did not oppose the adjournment.

11. First-tier Tribunal Judge Coll refused the adjournment and records  his
    reasons at [23]:

         "23. I note the chronology.  I disclosed to  Mr  O'Callaghan  Brien
             and Mr Snowden that I was a  fee  paid  Judge  in  the  social
             entitlement chamber and therefore accustomed to  understanding
             the significance of prescribed medication.  The Appellant  was
             prescribed a standard dose of Citalopram  (20  mg.),  a  first
             line anti-depressant in May 2016.   In  August  2016  about  2
             weeks before the date of the  August  hearing,  the  Appellant
             presented at his GP with various mental health  symptoms.   He
             was referred to the Psychiatric liaison nurse who  produced  a
             treatment plan.  I asked Mr O'Brien about this treatment plan.
              He did not have it in his file nor did he know anything about
             its contents.  At the same time the Appellant was referred  to
             the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Service.  He was discharged  in
             November 2016 having been assessed as  drug  free.   There  is
             nothing from the psychiatric liaison nurse nor from  the  Drug
             and Alcohol Treatment Service.  I note furthermore that in the
             August 2016 letter, the GP urged the  Tribunal  to  grant  the
             Appellant an adjournment of up to 6 months in  order  to  take
             advantage of treatment and medication.

              The adjournment was for 5� months.  On 17 January 2017 about 2
             weeks before this hearing, the Appellant presented to  the  GP
             with symptoms of  depression  stating  that  he  had  suicidal
             feelings and wanted to take drugs again.  I make the following
             findings.  First there is no evidence of GP  consultations  by
             the Appellant in the period August 2016 to  16  January  2017,
             the period of the adjournment.  Secondly the Appellant was not
             taking drugs as at the date of the GP  consultation.   Thirdly
             he was invited him to refer himself  again  to  the  Drug  and
             Alcohol Treatment Service.  I note that  the  GP  invited  him
             rather than referring him or taking positive steps himself  to
             ensure  that  the  Appellant  got  some  kind  of   treatment.
             Fourthly I note that the GP again repeats his statement in the
             August 2016 letter that the  Appellant  should  have  4  to  6
             months to aid his recovery via counselling and medication.   I
             find that there is no evidence that the Appellant has received
             counselling or will receive  counselling.   Therefore  I  find
             that there is no evidence  that  the  Appellant  would  use  a
             (further)  period  of  4  to  6  months  to  aid  recovery  as
             recommended by  the  GP.   More  significantly,  there  is  no
             specialist medical evidence for example from a psychiatrist or
             psychologist confirming that the Appellant has  mental  health
             problems which would prevent his attendance  at  the  hearing.
             Indeed, I find that the  Appellant's  medication  is  strongly
             suggestive of mild mental health problems and I note that  the
             GP did not increase the dosage  of  Citalopram  after  the  17
             January 2017 visit.

              The notice of this hearing was issued on 12 September 2016.  I
             have been provided with no good  reason  why  the  Appellant's
             solicitors could not have  prepared  the  Appellant's  witness
             statement in the Autumn of 2016 and in particular in or  about
             November 2016 when the Appellant was discharged from the  Drug
             and  Alcohol  Treatment  Service,  an  event  which  indicates
             recovery.   In  addition,  there  is  no  evidence  that   the
             Appellant will be better able or better disposed to  attending
             a hearing in 6 months' time.  To that end an adjournment would
             serve no purpose.

              In conclusion the solicitors have had plenty of time in  which
             to prepare the Appellant's  witness  statement  prior  to  the
             events in January 2017 which the Appellant would say made this
             impossible.  Secondly, there has been no explanation  for  the
             dearth of medical evidence.

             Having considered the overriding objective in Rule 2 and  Rule
             28 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (IAC) Rules
             2014, I conclude that it is in the  interests  of  justice  to
             proceed in the absence of the Appellant.  I  therefore  refuse
             the adjournment."

12. The grounds of appeal at paragraphs 26-30 maintain  that  the  decision
    refusing the adjournment was flawed where  it  ignored  the  particular
    comments of Dr GS that the appellant "looked anxious and agitated  with
    tremors in hands" and the GP's view that "the  Appellant  was  mentally
    unstable to attend court for a hearing".

13. However, it will be clear from  [23]  set  out  above  that  First-tier
    Tribunal Coll gave very careful consideration to the letter of Dr GS as
    well as to the previous material that had been provided concerning  the
    appellant's health and the earlier adjournment. It was  legitimate  for
    the judge to assess the GP's letter of 13 January 2017 in  the  context
    of the earlier adjournment on  very  similar  evidence  and  where  the
    appellant and his legal representatives had been afforded  five  months
    in which to decide how to deal with  the  appeal  if  he  remained  too
    unwell to attend.

14. Further, Judge Coll identifies that by  the  time  of  the  hearing  in
    January 2017 the appellant  had  been  discharged  from  the  Drug  and
    Alcohol Treatment  Service  in  November  2016.  He  had  not  accessed
    counselling as suggested by his GP. It did not appear that he had  gone
    to his GP between  September  2016  and  January  2017.  There  was  no
    information from mental health specialists. Nothing indicated that  the
    appellant could not have prepared a witness statement  with  his  legal
    advisers if it was thought he would not be well  enough  to  give  oral
    evidence after the five month adjournment. In my  view  the  judge  was
    entitled to note that the  appellant's  medication,  Citalopram,  is  a
    first line anti-depressant. The fact of that this is so is not disputed
    and it is a matter of sufficiently common knowledge for  the  judge  to
    have acted lawfully in including this factor in his consideration.

15. It was therefore the case that as of 31 January 2017 the  Tribunal  had
    acknowledged the appellant's mental health  problems  in  August  2016,
    afforded him time to access treatment and afforded him time  to  decide
    how to proceed with his appeal. The appellant had already been informed
    by the Tribunal on 18 January 2017 that the letter from the GP was  not
    considered sufficient to  warrant  an  adjournment.  These  were  again
    factors the judge was entitled to take into account when considering  a
    further adjournment.

16. The First-tier Tribunal considered the letter from  Dr  GS  in  detail,
    with care and against the other relevant materials and factors and gave
    clear and rational reasons for finding a further  adjournment  was  not
    appropriate. It is not arguable that an absence of  specific  reference
    to particular comments of Dr GS that the appellant "looked anxious  and
    agitated with tremors in hands" and the GP's view that  "the  Appellant
    was mentally unstable to attend court for a hearing" amounts  to  legal
    error. The judge was clearly aware of the GPs  comments,  gave  careful
    consideration to them but was not obliged to find  them  sufficient  to
    support the adjournment request in all the circumstances.

17. The appellant also objected in this ground to the  judge's  comment  at
    [58] of the decision that  "the  patient's  advocate".   Firstly,  that
    comment is made in an entirely different section of  the  determination
    and nothing suggests that it played  a  part  in  the  refusal  of  the
    adjournment request.  Secondly, as addressed above, in  order  to  make
    out an Article 3/8 ECHR medical claim, the appellant would have had  to
    provide material over and above the relatively brief GP letter. However
    approached by the judge, the GP's letter and  other  materials  showing
    the appellant had been discharged  from  specialist  services  and  not
    accessed treatment other than anti-depressants could not have made  out
    a medical claim.

18. For those reasons I did not find the challenge in Ground 4 to have  any
    merit.




    Paragraph 276B

19. Ground 3 in paragraphs 11-18 challenges the First-tier Tribunal Judge's
    finding that the appellant had not been present in the UK since  August
    1997.  I could not see that any of the points  raised  could  have  any
    material impact on the detailed findings contained in [37]-[53]. It was
    open to the judge to place positive weight on the letter from a  priest
    for the reasons given at [52] and less on other evidence,  including  a
    solicitor who provided written evidence  not  attending  to  give  oral
    evidence, considered at [44].  The judge was not obliged  to  take  the
    evidence of SK at its highest and her evidence was  not  first-hand  in
    any event as she could only report what the  appellant  had  told  her.
    The grounds do not suggest  that  the  Tribunal  failed  to  take  into
    account material  evidence.  The  suggestion  that  inadequate  reasons
    (rather than reasons with which the  appellant  does  not  agree)  were
    given is not arguable. The detailed reasoning over seventeen paragraphs
    shows which parts of the evidence attracted weight and  which  did  not
    and adequately set out why this part of the  claim  was  not  accepted.
    Where the material evidence was assessed in the round by the First-tier
    Tribunal the conclusion that the appellant had not  been  resident  for
    fourteen years was a lawful one.

    Article 8 - the appellant's daughter and return to India

20. The appellant also sought to challenge the findings of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal concerning the appellant's child, AY, including the conclusion
    that it was proportionate for the child to return  to  India  with  her
    parents and proportionate for the appellant to  leave  the  UK  and  AY
    remain in the UK with her mother.

21. The First-tier Tribunal found at [60] that AY, aged  three,  was  young
    enough to return to India with her parents. That is  uncontentious.  It
    was also found that the appellant, SK and AY could also be expected  to
    return as none of them had leave to remain. The judge indicated that SK
    was present in the UK only with s.3C leave; see  [(70(iv)].  I  am  not
    sure that the statement that SK has s.3C leave is consistent  with  the
    immigration history at [35] which suggests that she has no leave  after
    a curtailment in 2012 and only an  outstanding  judicial  review  which
    might lead to leave being granted. Be that as it may, she certainly did
    not have leave to  remain  and  her  status  was  precarious.  Even  if
    successful in obtaining leave as a result of her judicial  review  this
    would be for a limited period and still precarious with no  expectation
    of permanent stay.

22. I should mention for the sake of clarity here that the  judge  assessed
    section 117B(6) at [(70(iv)] but that this provision did not fall to be
    applied here as AY was not British and had not been in  the  UK  for  7
    years. Nothing material arises from that, however.

23. Further, in my judgement the First-tier Tribunal was entitled  to  find
    that there would not be significant difficulties on  return  to  India.
    The only evidence of this came from SK who stated at the  hearing  that
    she and the appellant were estranged from their families.  Her  witness
    statement maintained only that SK was estranged from  her  family,  not
    the  appellant.  There  was  nothing  from  the  appellant   confirming
    potential problems with either family because of their different castes
    and extramarital relationship. Nothing in the evidence showed why, even
    if that was accepted that both were estranged from their families  they
    could not return without family support, both presumably having managed
    without in the UK. There was no evidence that any  relatives  had  been
    actively hostility rather than merely declining support.

24. The grounds also object to the finding that it  was  proportionate  for
    the appellant, SK and AY could return because SK had  stated  that  she
    would not go back whilst her judicial review was outstanding.  However,
    this is addressed at [(70(iv)] where  the  judge  indicates  that  this
    would be a question of personal choice not of whether it was reasonable
    for SK to return with AY in order for the child to have a  family  life
    with her father.

25. It is not arguable that the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  take  into
    account AY's best interests in reaching the  conclusion  on  return  to
    India. At [59] the judge gave the following self-direction:

         "Furthermore, I am aware of the provisions of  Section  55  of  the
         Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009  (the  2009  Act)
         whereby the Respondent must make arrangements for ensuring that  in
         relation to any immigration, asylum or nationality functions regard
         must be had to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the
         children who are in the  United  Kingdom  and  I  have  taken  such
         matters into account in relation herein."

26. This self-direction was followed immediately by the assessment at  [60]
    that at the age of  3  the  appellant's  child  was  "young  enough  to
    establish her life in India and that the  Appellant  could  assist  her
    with establishing her cultural and family ties in  India".   As  above,
    there were no factors indicating otherwise, the family estrangement not
    being accepted or sufficient even if accepted  and  it  being  personal
    choice of the parents if AY did return or not.

27. Where the finding that it was proportionate for the appellant,  SK  and
    AY to exercise their family life in  India,  the  arguments  concerning
    AY's best interests if she remained and the appellant left the  UK  are
    not material.

    Remaining Grounds

28. Ground 5 concerns the finding at [71(v)] that  the  appellant's  mental
    health could not assist him in the Article 8 assessment. The First-tier
    Tribunal reached this  conclusion  on  the  basis  that  there  was  no
    specialist evidence on the issue and nothing other  than  the  mild  to
    moderate depression identified by the GP which was being  treated  with
    anti-depressants available in India. It  was  open  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to find that the  medical  issues  were  not  a  determinative
    factor in the Article 8 proportionality assessment given the degree  of
    ill-health indicated. Article 3 was not argued in the grounds of appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal, such a claim being  equally  unarguable  on
    the limited evidence here.

29. As regards Ground 6, it has been  long  understood  that  there  is  no
    principle  of  a  "near  miss"  to  be  taken   into   account   in   a
    proportionality assessment outside the Immigration  Rules.   Certainly,
    by the time of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the appellant
    had  established  a  significant  period  of  residence  but  this  was
    manifestly something that the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  aware  of  in
    making the decision given the detailed assessment of the long residence
    claim and conclusion that the appellant had come to the UK in  December
    1998 or  January  1999;  see  [53].   The  illegality  of  all  of  the
    appellant's residence meant that it attracted little weight.

30. It is also my view that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  was  correct  to
    conclude that delay by the respondent did not fall to  be  weighed  for
    the appellant in the proportionality assessment. There was no  material
    delay attributable to the respondent, the decision under challenge here
    following judicial review litigation not a failure to make  a  decision
    by the respondent.

31. For all of these reasons I do not find that the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge discloses an error on a point of law.

Notice of Decision

32. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an error on a
    point of law and shall stand.
