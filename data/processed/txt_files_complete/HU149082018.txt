Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms R Chapman, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The Appellant was born on 25th November 1984.  He is a male citizen  of
    India.

 2. He applied for leave to remain on 12th January 2018.  The heart of  his
    case is that he suffered an  accident  at  work  in  2012.   His  right
    (dominant) hand  was  crushed  by  a  fork  lift  truck.   This  caused
    significant damage.  Following surgery and  numerous  interventions  he
    has been diagnosed with a complex regional pain syndrome.  He is unable
    to use his right hand.  He has been admitted to a  mental  health  unit
    for inpatient treatment.  In December 2016 he received  a  dorsal  root
    ganglion stimulation implant for pain  relief  which  requires  ongoing
    checks and maintenance not available in India.

 3. The Respondent refused the application on 3rd July  2018.   The  matter
    came before Judge  Graves  on  12th  December  2018.   The  appeal  was
    dismissed.  Judge Kebede granted permission  to  appeal  on  2nd  April
    2019.  She stated:

         "There is arguable merit in the assertion of the grounds  that  the
         judge failed  to  consider  various  matters  relied  upon  by  the
         appellant including the question of stigma  and  discrimination  in
         relation to his mental health illness  and  his  parents'  lack  of
         knowledge of his condition which,  when  taken  cumulatively,  were
         arguably material.  Whilst the  other  grounds  perhaps  have  less
         arguable merit, I am satisfied that all grounds may be argued."

 4. Without seeking to do Miss Chapman's additional grounds any disservice,
    I summarise them in  this  way.   The  medical  evidence  is  that  the
    technology to support the implanted pulse generator  is  not  available
    currently in India, he would have difficulties in pursuing his personal
    injury claim from India, and the Judge erred in relation to the country
    and expert evidence, and the Appellant's ability to work, be supported,
    and regarding his integration here.

Submissions

 5. There was no Rule 24 notice.  Mr Bramble essentially submitted that the
    high threshold to establish an Article 3 claim was not reached even  if
    the matters of concern had been included in the assessment.  The  nerve
    implants were not a particularly relevant factor because the injury was
    not life threatening and treatment is available in India.  There are no
    very significant obstacles to the Appellant returning to live in India.
     The Judge does not have to set out everything and  did  refer  to  the
    mental health issues.  The litigation can be concluded with  him  being
    abroad because liability has been established and it is simply a matter
    of quantum being determined.  The grounds amount  to  no  more  than  a
    disagreement with the decision which is thorough.

 6. Ms Chapman  relied  on  her  original  Grounds  of  Appeal.   This  was
    primarily a case being brought  under  [276ADE]  of  the  Statement  of
    Changes in Immigration Rules HC 395 ("the Rules").  One  must  look  at
    human rights through the prism of the Rules.   The  findings  were  not
    adequate.  The issue of stigma should have been considered as it  feeds
    into the findings.  His disability means it will be difficult  for  him
    to work.  He will be confined to his local village which has  not  been
    taken into account.  The Judge has not taken into account the  evidence
    from the Appellant's personal injury solicitor as to  the  difficulties
    in taking instructions from him were he  not  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    There was no consideration regarding  the  impact  on  the  Appellant's
    physical and moral integrity.  She  accepted  that  it  was  a  careful
    decision, but, when the factors  she  had  identified  were  looked  at
    cumulatively, they could have made a difference.

Judge Grave's consideration of the evidence

 7. The Judge Stated at [14] of the judgment:

         "I asked what evidence there was of the impact of  removal  on  the
         appellant.  Ms Chapman directed me to the psychiatric  report,  but
         said because it was commissioned for the personal injury claim, the
         main thrust of that report related to that claim, and of course the
         issues were not necessarily the same as those in  this  appeal.   I
         asked if it was correct that the report appeared to find  that  the
         appellant could work, albeit with some support.   Ms  Chapman  said
         that was a correct reading of the report, and the  appellant  lived
         above a shop, with his friend.  I  asked  if  it  was  an  accurate
         reading of the report (p.94) that  the  appellant  had  denied  any
         suicidal ideation, and Ms Chapman said that was correct.  She  said
         the report showed that the appellant's mental health  continued  to
         improve, but there was continued  psychological  disturbance  (p98-
         99), but this was based on his living in this country.  He was on a
         high dose of Quetiapine (p.92)."

 8. The Judge continued at [15]:

         "I asked about the evidence of availability of  treatment  for  the
         appellant's condition, mindful that the respondent  says  treatment
         was available for the appellant's mental health problem  in  India,
         and for the type of pain relief treatment as well.  She said  (p.1)
         that the specific  type  of  implant  the  appellant  had  was  not
         available in India, although  other  types  were.   I  asked  about
         affordability of care and treatment, and Ms Chapman directed me  to
         the US Department of State report and expert report.   I  asked  if
         the experts could indeed be said to be suitably  qualified  in  the
         field of access to medical services, suitability, affordability and
         so on in India, when the report said they were lawyers and did  not
         address qualifications in that field.  Ms Chapman went through  the
         report with me, and said that at least one member of the  team  who
         had written the report worked at grass roots level in India, albeit
         as a lawyer, and the lawyers had  contacted  hospitals  and  spoken
         with doctors about what treatment was available.   I  asked  to  be
         addressed  again  in  submissions,  on  whether  only   contracting
         agencies, without direct experience of issues surrounding accessing
         treatment in India was sufficient.  When asked about  the  personal
         injury claim, Ms Chapman explained that the appellant was seeking a
         settlement in  the  region  of  over  �50,000.   I  asked  why  the
         appellant was saying such a claim could not be pursued while he was
         in India, and was  directed  to  an  email  from  the  lawyer  with
         responsibility for that claim, which said it would be difficult  to
         take instructions remotely.  The trial was set for September  2019,
         if it went ahead."

 9. Within [18] it states:

         "His specialist treatment from Dr Brener at  St  Thomas's  Hospital
         was privately paid  through  interim  payments  from  the  personal
         injury claim, (I noted that was  around  �3,200  according  to  the
         medical documents), but the rest of his treatment was on NHS and he
         only paid for his prescriptions, and did not pay for other  medical
         treatment from his GP or the psychiatrist."

10. The Appellant's family circumstances were noted in [19]:

         "...his mother had rheumatoid arthritis and has difficulty walking,
         and his father was very old and had been bitten by a snake, and due
         to the lack of specialist medical facilities in the  area,  he  had
         problems with the poison...  his friend Jignesh supported  them  by
         sending money home.  His dad would cook  for  his  mother  and  his
         aunties from the village came to the family home and  did  domestic
         chores for them as well.  They lived in a village in a rural area."



11. His work ability was noted in [20/21]:

         "he would only be able to work with one hand. Most  days  were  bad
         although some were good and there was also his  mental  condition."
         "...the family home ... was owned by one of  his  aunts,  only  his
         parents lived there, he had no siblings. He only had his cousin and
         aunts, who lived a ten to fifteen minute  walk  from  his  parents'
         home." "... they were  helping  his  parents  because  Jingesh  was
         sending them money and they would not help him."

         Jingesh "...did ask the appellant to served people at the till, but
         he found it difficult.  He could fill things, or move  things,  put
         things away, but had to be shown what to  do.  He  did  not  always
         remember what a customer had asked for."

12. His care needs were noted in [22/23]. He could not:

         "manage in his home village...His dad  was  seventy  four  and  his
         mother was on bed rest with arthritis. They could  not  look  after
         the appellant. The family did  take  the  father  to  hospital  for
         appointments but that was the only help they provided."

         Jingesh "...did the washing up and washed the appellant's  clothes.
         He did up the appellant's shoe laces...he gave him a  bath  two  or
         three times a week." He could not continue to support him in  India
         "...because his wife was coming to live in the  United  Kingdom  to
         live with him and there would be lots of expenses.  Healthcare  was
         very expensive in India, and if the appellant  was  sent  back,  he
         would have a break down."

Judge Grave's judgement

13. In relation to health conditions and treatment, the Judge in particular
    noted the report from Dr Brener (15th October 2018) at  [27]  that  the
    Appellant was:

         "  'clearly better than when I last  examined  him',  still  having
         some auditory hallucinations,  he  was  having  flashbacks  of  the
         accident, but was able to have more eye  to  eye  contact  and  his
         speech was more fluent.  He was still suffering  with  present  and
         constant pain in his hand, although less than  previously  and  had
         back pain, but was trying to get  out  of  the  house  as  much  as
         possible.  He was going to temple each week and getting out to  see
         a few friends.  He was going out alone to  temples  sometimes,  and
         seeing his counsellor and GP  alone,  could  deal  with  money  and
         change, do light shopping and meet friends in town alone.   He  had
         been helping in the shop downstairs for two or  three  hours  on  a
         weekly basis, putting things on  shelves,  and  had  served  a  few
         customers from the  till,  with  support  and  encouragement.    He
         reported that: "when he feels better he can do more...if there  are
         auditory hallucinations or his mood is particularly low, he  cannot
         leave the house.' "

         And at [28] that;

         "The appellant  had  been  diagnosed  with  Post  Traumatic  Stress
         Disorder with depression..., was 'feeling better' after a change in
         medication, he was still hearing some voices,  but  'his  mood  had
         lifted a little', he was still experiencing hypervigilance, but his
         sleep had improved, he denied 'suicidal thoughts', and was seeing a
         counsellor, but had been referred  back  to  his  GP  by  secondary
         mental health services, and was getting 'minimal input' from  them.
         He  still  had  symptoms  of  his  illness  but  'these  are   less
         significant' and was 'certain' that he was 'much better as  far  as
         it goes'. In terms of work, he could deal  with  money  and  follow
         instructions to work in a shop, such as stacking shelves.  In terms
         of future mental health treatment, he would still need  input  'for
         at least a year or so', such as  therapy  and  medication...factors
         could 'lead to a worsening of his mental state' such as immigration
         matters."

         And at [29] that;

         "In terms of medication, the appellant is  taking  Quetiapine,  for
         mood stabilisation,  Pregabalin  for  nerve  pain,  Paroxetine  and
         Mirtazapine, and has a spinal cord stimulator (p.195).  He  remains
         under the  care  of  his  GP,  and  has  talking  therapy.  He  was
         previously hospitalised for a lengthy period in 2014 and 2015.  His
         specialist  psychotherapist  ...   found   him   to   have   'still
         significantly reduced mental health', that was 'improving', with no
         current 'active suicidal thoughts' (p.196)."

         And at [30] that;

         "In terms of physical health, the appellant receives... medication,
         and the spinal implant, and has loss of function  and  use  of  his
         right hand and arm. He has also reported pain in his shoulders  and
         back. He reports high level of pain."

         And at [31];

         "in terms  of  the  appellant's  care  needs,  his  psychotherapist
         described him as being 'mostly independent  with  self  care',  but
         needing help to wash his hand and forearm, and relying  on  support
         from his friend to shop, cook and  clean,  although  as  above,  Dr
         Bremer found he was doing some shopping and  was  getting  out  and
         about."

14. The Judge found at [32]:

         "that the appellant does have mental health problems, but they  are
         currently improving, although he still suffers with symptoms of his
         PTSD and low mood.  The evidence is not sufficient  to  demonstrate
         that the appellant would suffer catastrophic or major deterioration
         or increased risk of suicide if removed, although I find it  likely
         that the appellant would suffer some deterioration  in  his  mental
         state.  However, steps could be  taken  to  manage  that,  such  as
         support, therapy, and communication with doctors in  India  and  in
         advance of any removal date.  The  respondent  can  take  steps  to
         provide mental health support during the process  of  removal.   He
         would also be returning to the support of family,  and  could  live
         with his parents, with whom he maintains a close relationship.   In
         terms of his mental health, I find that it has not been established
         that the actual process of removal would have such an  impact  upon
         his mental or physical  health,  that  it  would  breach  the  high
         threshold in Article 3."

15. The Judge then considers the availability of  treatment  in  India  and
    states:

         At [33];

         "that the respondent has referred to evidence of  available  mental
         health services, specialist psychiatric  care  and  medication  for
         mental health problems, and the appellant has not established  that
         such treatment would not be available or accessible to him. I  find
         his friend has not addressed why, if he is currently supporting the
         appellant financially, paying for  all  of  his  living  costs  and
         providing free accommodation for many years, as well as  supporting
         the appellant's parents in India, he would suddenly stop  providing
         such support if the appellant were sent to India. The evidence also
         does not support a finding that the appellant could not work. While
         I accept he suffers from mental health problems,  he  is  currently
         doing part time work in this country, albeit with support, and also
         has family close by  in  India,  who  are  already  supporting  his
         parents. He has not established why  he  could  not  also  work  in
         India, although I accept heavy physical work or  similar  would  of
         course not be suitable, he already works  in  two  shops,  and  his
         qualified and educated. He was previously hoping to qualify  as  an
         accountant."

         At [34] in relation to the experts report that;

         "it has not been established that the writers of  that  report  are
         sufficiently expert in the distribution, accessibility  and  access
         to  medication  and  treatment  in  India....  I  find  that  while
         treatment of a specialist nature may not be to the same standard as
         that available in the United Kingdom, and there may be more  issues
         in rural areas, there is  a  functioning  healthcare  system,  with
         access to doctors and medication both in rural areas and cities."

         At [35] the Judge stated;

         "I do accept that the appellant suffers from high  levels  of  pain
         and loss of function in his hand and right arm, but  he  does  have
         other physical function. He says the specific type  of  implant  he
         uses is not available in  India,  but  the  respondent  says  other
         similar types of implant are available there, and the appellant has
         not said that he could not use them. It has  not  been  established
         that treatment  for  his  condition  would  be  beyond  his  reach,
         financially, practically, or that despite living in a  rural  area,
         he could not travel further afield to seek treatment. I accept that
         the photographs of his home suggest that the conditions  are  basic
         there, but he is largely independent with self care,  and  this  is
         his home, where he lived most of his life  and  where  his  parents
         live, and he has  not  established  that  he  would  be  destitute,
         homeless, or that the conditions there breach Article 3."

16. The Judge then considers the availability of  treatment  in  India  and
    states:

         At [37];

         the "appellant does not have family life here.... it has  not  been
         established  that  the  appellant  would  suffer  very  significant
         obstacles  in  his  re-integration  in  India...  his  health   and
         vulnerability would make things more difficult for him, but it  has
         not been shown that he could not revisit his ties  and  connections
         to the country of his own nationality. He speaks the languages, and
         will have strong cultural, familial and social ties there, built up
         through childhood and adulthood. His family  do  live  in  a  rural
         area, but he could return to live with them....  while  his  family
         home may be basic and in poor repair, those are the same conditions
         the appellant was raised in and are not unusual for many  parts  of
         the world... they are not a very significant obstacle  to  his  re-
         integration, and even taking into account his mental  and  physical
         health problems, it has not been  established  that  he  could  not
         access  treatment,  further  education  or  employment  if  he   so
         chooses."

         And at [38];

         "I accept that removal may impact upon his health, but  his  family
         could  support  him  emotionally  and  there  are  health  services
         available in India. Nor do I believe that his friend here, who  has
         been so supportive for so many years, would abandon  the  appellant
         and his family only because he has returned to India."

         And at [39];

         "It is not clear what, if any, quantum  of  damages  the  appellant
         will  ultimately  receive  through  his  personal   injury   claim.
         However... quantum now appears to be the main issue in dispute  and
         the appellant has already been receiving  interim  payments,  after
         some initial acceptance of liability. If he  does  receive  further
         money from this claim, that money would also  serve  to  facilitate
         the  appellant's  access  to  services  and  support,  as  well  as
         treatment, and would go a considerable way  towards  improving  his
         living circumstances in India."

17. In relation to Article 8 the Judge found that:

         At [42];

         The "appellant has a private life here, established over  the  nine
         years of  his  residence,  formed  through  friendships,  work  and
         studies. He does not have a family life here  and  his  family  all
         live in India... He was initially resident here only as a  student,
         which is a route that does not lead to settlement.  His  leave  was
         only precarious and since then he has been unlawfully  present.  He
         would have at all times have been aware that he could  be  returned
         at any time to India."

         And at [43];

         "The appellant has also not  demonstrated  that  he  is  integrated
         here, through speaking English. While he is not  a  burden  on  the
         social assistance system now, he is receiving a significant  amount
         of specialist healthcare and intervention, and has not paid for the
         majority of that treatment. It is likely that he will  continue  to
         be reliant upon support and treatment for some time, although if he
         does receive a settlement from his  claim  that  would  reduce  the
         likely burden of his care that lies upon the state."

         And at [44];

         "The evidence does not support a finding  that  his  removal  would
         trigger a substantial  deterioration  in  his  mental  or  physical
         health. There is insufficient evidence to establish  that  adequate
         and  appropriate  treatment  is  not  accessible,   affordable   or
         available there ...even while he may not regain the use of his hand
         and arm, the prognosis is not so bleak that he cannot  work  again,
         even taking into account his mental health problems. He is  already
         doing some part-time work that requires some  physical  tasks,  and
         can manage money. I find that it has not been established that with
         support, he could not return to work again."

18. In relation to this personal injury claim the Judge stated [45]:

         "The appellant's solicitors in that claim say that at times  it  is
         difficult to take instructions from him, and it would be easier  to
         pursue the claim if he was physically present at meetings. However,
         I find it has not been established that  the  appellant  could  not
         instruct  the  solicitor  by  modern  means  of  communication,  by
         telephone  and  the  use  of  the   internet   and   online   video
         conferencing. If his physical attendance at trial is required... it
         will be open to him to  seek  a  visit  visa,  if  he  cannot  give
         evidence and instructions by video  conferencing.  Such  facilities
         are available in India ... litigation can and does continue with an
         appellant in a different country."

Discussion

19. I have set out the evidence and findings in detail as one only  has  to
    read them to see that great care was taken by the Judge to consider the
    evidence, and that the Judgement was detailed. The Judge does not  have
    to set out every single piece of evidence.

20. The Judge considered the evidence regarding his parents'  circumstances
    and support available in India (see Judgement at [15, 19, 20,  22,  and
    23]) and made findings available regarding how that would continue  and
    adequately provide for him on his return (see  [32,  33,  34,  37,  and
    38]). It has  not  been  evidentially  established  that  he  would  be
    stigmatised by his parents or other family in  India  or  discriminated
    against due to his condition, or that consequently  they  would  reduce
    the support he requires for that. In essence, the Appellant has guessed
    based on a generality that is not supported by specific  evidence  that
    his parents and other family members would act in that way.  The  Judge
    did not therefore need to particularise the country evidence  any  more
    than was done, and which did  not  materially  differ  from  the  other
    evidence available.

21. The Judge was aware that the technology to support the implanted  pulse
    generator is not available currently in India (see Judgement at  [35]),
    and  made  evidence-based  findings  that  alternative  treatment   was
    available.  The  fact  that  alternative  treatment  for  a  non  life-
    threatening ailment may require additional surgery to ensure it can  be
    subsequently supported by the technology and  medication  available  in
    India does not mean that it would  be  disproportionate  to  remove  an
    Appellant.

22. The Judge was aware of the difficulties in pursuing his personal injury
    claim from India, (see Judgement  at  [15]),  and  made  evidence-based
    findings (at [39]) that such litigation as remained  could  be  pursued
    either with him being in India or by him applying for a visit  visa  to
    return should it be required.

23. The Judge considered the expert evidence carefully  (see  Judgement  at
    [15]) and made evidence-based findings (see [34]) as to why the opinion
    contained therein was not accepted.

24. The Judge considered the evidence regarding the Appellant's ability  to
    work (see Judgement at [14, 20, 21, 27,  and  28])  and  made  findings
    available on that evidence (see [33 and 37]).

25. The Judge considered the evidence regarding his integration  here  (see
    Judgement at [20, 23, and 27) and made evidence-based findings (see [42
    and 43]) on its limited weight.

26. I am satisfied that  all  of  the  findings  made  by  the  Judge  were
    available on the evidence.  The grounds amount to nothing more  than  a
    disagreement with those findings.  The Judge  was  well  aware  of  the
    concerns about his physical and mental health problems he may  have  on
    his return to India.  The Judge was entitled to  find  that  no  factor
    individually, and no combination of factors, tipped the proportionality
    balancing exercise in the Appellant's favour.

27. I am not satisfied there is a material error of law and I  dismiss  the
    appeal.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
