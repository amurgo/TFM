Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Blake, Counsel instructed by AKL Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent, to whom I shall refer as the Claimant, is a national of
    Nepal born on 11 December 1981.  She appealed against the  decision  of
    the Respondent dated 19 September 2017 refusing further leave to remain
    in the UK on the basis of an assertion that the TOEIC English  language
    test that she had undertaken on 17 September 2013 had been obtained  by
    deception.  The appellant appealed against that decision and her appeal
    came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Trevaskis for  hearing  on
    21 June 2018.  In a Decision and Reasons promulgated on 2 July 2018  he
    allowed the appeal. The Secretary of State sought permission to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal against this decision.

 2. The renewed grounds in support of the  application  for  permission  to
    appeal asserted: firstly, that the judge failed to assess correctly the
    burden of proof in line with the  jurisprudence  cf.  SM  and  Qadir  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (ETS - Evidence - Burden  of
    Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC) and Shehzad [2016] EWCA Civ 615 heard by
    Lord Justice Beatson at [22]; secondly, that the judge had  erroneously
    relied on the Claimant's English language  ability  and  qualifications
    and had been far too generous in his assessment  of  that  ability  and
    that this was, in any event, contrary to the judgment of  MA  (Nigeria)
    [2016] UKUT 450 at [57] and the judge failed to give  adequate  reasons
    for finding that a person who speaks English would have  no  reason  to
    secure a test certificate by deception; thirdly, in  finding  that  the
    fact the Claimant was able to recall details of her journey to the test
    centre and the examination process does not  mean  that  the  appellant
    necessarily took the test in  light  of  the  BBC  Panorama  programme;
    fourthly, that the judge materially misdirected himself in applying  an
    impermissibly high standard of proof in determining the deception issue
    at [57] in finding that the Secretary of State could obtain evidence in
    the form of video or audio. It was asserted that the evidential  burden
    was met and thus it  fell  upon  the  Claimant  to  adopt  an  innocent
    explanation and the Judge failed to correctly apply these principles.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Hanson  in  a
    decision dated 8 November 2018, on the basis that there  were  arguable
    legal errors identified in the grounds of  appeal,  which  amounted  to
    more than a disagreement with the findings of the judge.

     Hearing

 4. Ms Pal submitted  that  the  judge  failed  to  adequately  assess  the
    evidence provided for the purposes of the appeal  hearing.   The  judge
    had the witness statement of the two civil servants and the spreadsheet
    extract and also the relevant information from the  look-up  tool  (see
    [56] and [57] of the decision) and this evidence had been considered by
    the Upper Tribunal and Court of Appeal to be sufficient (the  Secretary
    of State's generic evidence).  She submitted that this,  combined  with
    the evidence relevant to the Claimant, shows that the English  language
    test certificate could be procured by dishonesty.   She  asserted  that
    the findings at [57] were wholly inadequate  and  that  the  judge  had
    failed to assess and correctly apply the burden of proof.  At [59]  the
    judge made his findings on the basis of an absence of any evidence from
    the Secretary of State, which  was  an  erroneous  application  of  the
    burden and standard of proof, in light of the fact that the  judge  had
    the look-up tool.  However, she acknowledged that there  were  no  test
    results in relation to  the  actual  Universal  Training  Centres,  but
    rather that, out of the results 47 are being  treated  as  invalid  and
    five as questionable out of 53 tests taken on the day  and  that  there
    were a number of  Universal  Training  Centres,  however  the  specific
    location at which the Claimant took her test have not been specified by
    the Secretary of State as part of the assertion of deception.

 5. Ms Pal submitted that the Secretary of State argued that the judge  had
    sufficient evidence to enable him to make a finding that the  Secretary
    of State had discharged the evidential burden and ought  then  to  have
    gone on to consider whether there was an innocent explanation.

 6. In his submissions on behalf of the Claimant, Mr Blake  submitted  that
    the decision read in the round did  not  show  an  error  of  law.   He
    submitted that this was not the first appeal, but rather there had been
    an appeal before Upper Tribunal Judges Trevaskis  and  Dawson  in  2013
    which had been allowed, and this was  related  to  a  previous  English
    language test taken in Edexcel which the  Claimant  had  undertaken  in
    April 2012, but had been unsuccessful on the basis  that  Edexcel  were
    not at that time on the list of approved  test  providers  (F2  of  the
    respondent's bundle at 2.)  The ETS deception  allegation  arose  after
    the appeal had been remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. In relation to the decision in Qadir, Mr Blake submitted  even  if  the
    judge was wrong at [58] to find that the Secretary  of  State  had  not
    demonstrated sufficient evidence to justify a reasonable  suspicion  of
    fraud he, in any event, clearly went on at [59] to consider whether the
    Claimant had given an explanation and found that she did (at  [59]  and
    [60]), therefore the burden shifts back to the Secretary  of  State  to
    demonstrate that  the  Claimant's  explanation  is  not  innocent.   He
    submitted that when one looked at the decision as a  whole,  the  judge
    was entitled to conclude that the Secretary of State had not discharged
    the burden.  The judge had correctly  identified  and  noted  that  the
    Secretary of  State  had  produced  evidence  from  a  camera  with  an
    audio/video.  This was not part of the  Secretary  of  State's  generic
    evidence because no centre had been identified in this particular case,
    but rather the  Secretary  of  State  had  agreed  that  such  evidence
    existed.   Mr  Blake  submitted  that  given  there  was   a   criminal
    investigation, the Secretary of State was on notice that  he  could  be
    expected to produce this evidence.

 8. In relation to the assertion that the  judge  should  have  taken  into
    account evidence, e.g. from the Panorama programme,  this  is  not  the
    case in that the alleged deception varied from centre to centre and the
    judge, in any event, directed himself in respect of the Project  Fa�ade
    investigation at [57] and was alive to the wider issues.

 9. Mr Blake submitted that the judge  directly  referred  himself  to  the
    relevant case law at [50] onwards, e.g. Gazi (ETS  -  judicial  review)
    [2015] UKUT 00327, SM and Qadir [2016] UKUT  00229  (IAC)  and  Shezhad
    [2016] EWCA Civ 615. The judge had the  benefit  of  the  Claimant  and
    witnesses giving evidence and accepted their evidence at [59]  and  see
    also [55]. In relation to the assertion that the judge  relied  on  the
    Claimant's English language ability, this is not the case and there  is
    no finding to that effect.  He was entitled to take account of the fact
    that the Claimant had previously passed the Edexcel test, but  at  [55]
    he  noted  that  whilst  the  Claimant  understands  English,  she  had
    difficulty expressing herself in a tense situation such as the hearing,
    that she had a strong accent and  he  formed  the  impression  she  had
    difficulty understanding the Secretary of  State's  representative  who
    had a pronounced Welsh accent, thus it was clear he did not rely on her
    English language ability in allowing the appeal.

10. In respect of the look-up tool,  Mr  Blake  submitted  that  this  only
    identified the centre as a Universal  Training  Centre.   He  submitted
    that many of the cases in the First-tier Tribunal turn  upon  a  proper
    assessment being made, given the frailty of the evidence provided.   It
    was necessary for a judge to make a rounded  assessment  correctly  and
    the judge had  done  that,  finding  that  at  [60]  in  light  of  his
    conclusions that the Claimant's  evidence  had  not  been  obtained  by
    fraud, he was satisfied she had attended the test  personally  and  had
    taken it without the use of a proxy.  He submitted the findings of fact
    at [59] were important, particularly as no evidence had  been  produced
    by the Secretary of State as to the location of the  test  centre,  and
    there was no police  investigation  into  that  specific  test  centre,
    unlike e.g. Project Fa�ade.  He submitted that this was good enough  to
    discharge the burden on the Claimant to show  an  innocent  explanation
    and the findings were open to the judge in all  the  circumstances  and
    had not been challenged  by  the  respondent  in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal.

     Decision and Reasons

11. First-tier Tribunal Judge Trevaskis held as follows at [56] through  to
    [60]:-

         "56. With regard to the allegation of fraud, I begin by considering
             the evidence relied upon by the respondent.  It  is  found  in
             annex G of the respondent's bundle.   The  'generic  evidence'
             identifies Universal  Training  Centre  as  one  of  the  test
             centres identified in the BBC  investigation.   The  appellant
             undertook and passed the test provided by Edexcel in September
             2012,  having  completed  an  approved  program  at  Universal
             Training Centre; that  test  was  rejected  only  because  the
             provider  was  not  on  the  respondent's  list  of   approved
             providers.  The tests under  challenge  in  this  appeal  were
             those taken on 16 and 17 September 2013;  those  results  were
             before the  Upper  Tribunal  on  29  November  2013  when  the
             appellant's appeal against the refusal of  further  leave  was
             allowed; no issue was then raised regarding the impropriety of
             those tests; the respondent claims that  suspicions  began  in
             May 2013 [G5 paragraph 14].

         57.  The only evidence which directly identifies and relates to the
             appellant is the 'look-up tool' E1 to 3  RB.   It  relates  to
             tests undertaken on 17 September 2013 and only identifies  the
             test centre as Universal Training Centre; no evidence has been
             provided by the respondent to identify the actual location  of
             the tests; the documentation of  that  organisation  indicates
             that it is based in Watford.  The appellant  has  stated  that
             the tests were recorded, by audio and/or video; the respondent
             has not sought to rebut that claim; since it is  alleged  that
             the appellant has used a proxy,  it  would  be  reasonable  to
             assume that any investigation  on  behalf  of  the  respondent
             would  have  involved  examination  of  such  evidence,  or  a
             statement that no such evidence exists.  The absence  of  such
             evidence from the respondent undermines the  strength  of  her
             assertions of fraud by the appellant.  Bearing  in  mind  that
             the tests have previously been accepted by the  respondent  in
             the context of an Upper Tribunal hearing, I am surprised that,
             when asserting fraud, the  respondent  is  unable  to  produce
             evidence as to the location of the allegedly fraudulent tests.
              In relation to other test centres, there has been  concurrent
             police  investigations,  which  have  produced  reports,   for
             example Project Fa�ade; no such evidence  is  relied  upon  in
             this case.

         58.  Having regard to the above factors, I am  not  satisfied  that
             the respondent has demonstrated sufficient evidence to justify
             a reasonable suspicion of fraud by this appellant.

         59.  Even if I am wrong about that, based on the evidence  which  I
             have received, and making the rounded assessment  which  I  am
             required to make, I find that I am satisfied to  the  required
             standard on the evidence  which  has  been  presented  by  the
             appellant that her test scores were not obtained by  means  of
             fraud, or by the use of a proxy  to  take  the  tests  on  her
             behalf.  In evaluating the evidence of the appellant  and  her
             witnesses, I have made appropriate allowance for their obvious
             nervousness and difficulty of comprehension, as  well  as  the
             fact that they were being asked to recall  events  which  took
             place almost five years ago.  In the absence of  any  evidence
             from the respondent  as  to  the  location  of  the  allegedly
             fraudulent tests, I am satisfied to the required standard that
             the  appellant  has  shown  that  she   attended   the   tests
             personally, and she undertook them without the involvement  of
             a  proxy.   She  has  described  in  acceptable   detail   the
             procedures followed at the test centre, which  have  not  been
             contradicted by the respondent.

         60.  I therefore conclude that  the  test  certificates  which  she
             provided in support of her  application  for  leave  were  not
             obtained fraudulently."

12. I find the judge has  given  adequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the
    Claimant did not utilise a proxy.  Key to his findings in this  respect
    is:-

      1) the fact that the Secretary of State accepted there  was  audio  or
         video evidence of the Claimant or a proxy undertaking the test  but
         failed to produce this evidence to prove his  contention  that  the
         test was not undertaken by the Claimant;

      2) the fact that none of the generic  evidence  addressed  the  actual
         location of the test centre; and

      3) that no specific test results from that test centre  were  released
         or provided by the training centre.
13.  The grounds of appeal contend that the judge failed to assess
correctly the burden of    proof in line with the jurisprudence, however,
it is apparent from [50]-[52] that this is   not the case as the Judge
expressly directed himself in respect of the relevant     jurisprudence.
The grounds of appeal further assert that the judge had erroneously
relied on the Claimant's English language ability and qualifications,
however, I    accept Mr Blake's submission that this assertion is not borne
out by what the Judge  actually found at [55]. In respect of the challenge
to the Judge's finding that the     Claimant was able to recall details of
her journey to the test centre and the  examination process    does not
mean that she necessarily took the test in light of the   BBC Panorama
programme is nothing more than a disagreement with the Judge's     finding
of fact, which was open to him on the evidence.

14.  In respect of the assertion that the judge materially misdirected
himself in applying    an impermissibly high standard of proof in
determining the deception issue at [57] in   his finding that the Secretary
of State could have obtained evidence in the form of  video or audio, which
was apparently available but not produced I find this was a    material
consideration that the Judge was entitled to take into account. He gave
clear    reasons for his finding at [57] and I do not find that this
amounted to the Judge  imposing an "impermissibly high standard of proof"
but that this was simply one of     a number of factors that he considered
in the round when determining the appeal.

15.  Further, in light of the Judge's detailed reasons for finding that the
Secretary of  State's assertion that this particular Claimant had utilised
a proxy or deception in    order to obtain her English language test result
had not been proved on the balance  of probabilities, I find no error of
law in his decision.

Notice of Decision

16.  I find no  material  errors  of  law  in  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Trevaskis.  I uphold that decision with the effect  that  the
appeal by the Secretary of State is     dismissed.

17.  No anonymity direction is made.
