    Upon the parties signifying their consent to this decision,

DECISION

 1. The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.

 2. The First-tier Tribunal Judge made an error on a point of law  for  the
    reasons set  out  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  I  set  aside  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge J.K. Swaney.

 3. I substitute a determination dismissing the appeal of Ms Kesgin against
    the decision of the Secretary of State made on 19 February 2016 on  all
    the grounds advanced.

                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
