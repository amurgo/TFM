                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellants against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Khan promulgated on 23 January 2015 which dismissed  the
    Appellants' appeal against a refusal of further leave to remain on  all
    grounds and to make  directions  for  their  removal  from  the  United
    Kingdom. .

Background

 3. The Appellants are all citizens of Nigeria a mother whose date of birth
    was 20 January 1974 and her three children born on 22 January 2004,  20
    November 2005 and 5 March 2013 respectively.

 4. The Appellants applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the
    basis of their family and private life.

 5. On 10 September 2014 the Secretary of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. The refusal letter in essence found that the Appellant did
    not meet the suitability requirements as she had an outstanding debt of
    over ï¿½1000 with the NHS, the parent route requirements or  the  private
    life requirements of Appendix FM including EX.1 and  paragraph  276ADE.
    No exceptional circumstances were found to warrant  a  grant  of  leave
    outside the Rules.

The Judge's Decision

 6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  M  A  Khan  ("the  Judge")  dismissed  the  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's decision. The Judge heard oral evidence from the Appellant
    who appeared in person. The Appellant was cross examined and the  Judge
    made a  number  of  findings  at  paragraphs  26-37  and  concluded  by
    dismissing the appeals. He found in essence:

      a) The first Appellant was not a credible witness.

      b) The 3 children would have a right to an education  in  Nigeria  and
         their best interests would not be affected by  being  removed  with
         their mother to Nigeria.

      c) S117b meant that family and private life built up during illegal or
         precarious stay in the United Kingdom cannot be considered.

 7. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing:

      a) There were a number of references in the  decision  to  facts  that
         bore no relation to the Appellants' appeal.

      b) The facts erroneously referred  to  appear  to  relate  to  a  case
         involving a mother and father and  two  children  and  one  of  the
         family members was in need of medical treatment.

      c) The Judge failed to consider paragraph 276ADE (iv) in  relation  to
         Sainab who has lived in the United Kingdom for more than 7 years.

      d) The Judge has misdirected himself in relation to paragraph 117B  of
         the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 8.  On 17 March 2015 First-tier immigration Judge Pooler  gave  permission
    to appeal on all grounds.

 9. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr  Clarke  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants that :

      a) He relied on his skeleton argument that set out the  three  grounds
         that argued the Judge had made material errors of law.

      b) The Judge had in essence mixed up  the  facts  of  two  cases.  The
         errors  were  so  numerous  they  could   not   be   explained   as
         typographical errors or minor confusion.

      c) The Appellants had a fundamental right to have the facts  of  their
         case anxiously scrutinised.

      d) Given the material mistakes of  fact  the  Tribunal  could  not  be
         confident that the credibility findings were made on the  basis  of
         the correct case.

      e) The Judges summary of s 117b at paragraph 37 was wrong in  law  and
         required a more nuanced consideration.

      f) The Judge had failed entirely to consider paragraph  117B  (vi)  in
         relation to the children given that the operative date for that was
         the date of hearing and the Judge had accepted that the family  had
         lived in the United Kingdom since November 2007.

      g) The assessment at paragraph 35 of Article 8 was inadequate and ther
         was no consideration of the family's reintegration in Nigeria.

      h) There was evidence from the children's school about the  impact  of
         removal and this was not apparently considered.

10. On behalf of the Respondent Ms Holmes fairly conceded that she  was  in
    some difficulty in relation to the decision and chose to say no more.

Finding on Material Error

11. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made material errors of law.

12. I am satisfied that there is clear evidence that the Judge confused the
    facts of two different cases in this decision and this is evidenced  in
    the following paragraphs of the decision :

      a) Paragraph 7 there is reference to the Appellants being  represented
         although they appeared in person unrepresented.

      b) Paragraph 10 there is reference to the oral evidence  of  the  fist
         and second Appellant  when  only  the  first  Appellant  gave  oral
         evidence.

      c)   Paragraph 28 refers to the Appellant having 2 children  when  she
         has 3.

      d) Paragraph 29 there is reference to 'their children' suggesting  two
         parent Appellants.

      e) Paragraph 29 there is reference  to  someone  called  Gail  needing
         medical care . There is no one called Gail in this appeal.

      f) Paragraph 31 refers to removal to India when these  Appellants  are
         Nigerian.

      g) Paragraph 34 refers to the best interests of  the  'teo  children'.
         This case involves 3 children.

13. The failure of the First-tier Tribunal to  address  and  determine  the
    facts of this appeal based on an accurate factual matrix constitutes  a
    clear error of law. This error I consider to be material since had  the
    Tribunal conducted this exercise the outcome could have been different.

14. I am satisfied that the Judges assessment of whether the Appellants met
    the requirements of the  Rules  or  Article  8  was  wholly  inadequate
    because he failed to address and determine whether  the  provisions  of
    paragraph 276 ADE(iv) or paragraph 117B(vi) applied in this case  given
    the length of residence of the third Appellant who arrived  in  the  UK
    aged 12 months and was 9 at the date of hearing. This  was  a  material
    error of law.

15. I am satisfied that the Judge misdirected himself as to s 117B and  the
    impact of unlawful or precarious status: the provision  does  not  sate
    that family and private life 'cannot be  considered'  but  rather  that
    'little weight' should be given in those circumstances and therefore  a
    more nuanced assessment was required than that given by the Judge.

16. I therefore found that errors of law have been established and that the
    Judge's determination cannot  stand  and  must  be  set  aside  in  its
    entirety. All matters to be redetermined afresh.

17. Under Part 3 paragraph 7.2(b) of the Upper Tribunal Practice  Statement
    of the 25th of September 2012 the case may be  remitted  to  the  First
    Tier Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

    (a)    the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case to be put to and considered by the First-tier
         Tribunal; or

    (b)    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2, it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

18. In this case I have determined that the case should be remitted because
    the Appellants did not have a fair hearing due to  the  fact  that  the
    Judge had manifestly confused the facts  of  two  cases  and  therefore
    failed to make adequate findings in relation either  to  the  Rules  or
    Article 8. In this case none of the findings of fact are to  stand  and
    the matter will be a complete re hearing.

19. I consequently remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal sitting
    at Taylor House to be heard on a date to be fixed before any First-tier
    Immigration Judge other than First-tier Immigration Judge M A Khan.
