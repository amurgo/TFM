Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Kaihiva, Counsel, instructed by Queen's Park
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity direction under  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (S.I. 2008/2698 as amended).

 2. The  appellant  is  a  national  of  Nigeria.   On  February  10,  2015
    solicitors acting on behalf of the appellant lodged an  application  as
    confirmation of the appellant's right to reside in the United  Kingdom.
    The appellant had made an application on the basis  that  she  was  the
    divorced spouse of an EEA  national  who  had  been  exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom and at the date of  divorce  she  too  was
    working in the United Kingdom.  The respondent refused her  application
    on June 23, 2015 and grounds of appeal were lodged by her on  July  15,
    2015 under Regulation 26 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006  and
    Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. Her appeal came before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Herlihy  on
    November 9, 2016 and in a decision promulgated on November 29, 2016 the
    Judge dismissed her appeal and found that the respondent's decision was
    in accordance with the EEA Regulations.

 4. The appellant appealed this decision on December 13, 2016, arguing that
    the Judge had erred in assessing  evidence  regarding  the  appellant's
    work and secondly had erred in the application of  Regulation  15(1)(f)
    of the 2006  Regulations.   Permission  to  appeal  this  decision  was
    granted by Designated Judge Macdonald on June 9, 2017  and  the  matter
    was listed before me on the above date.

 5. Having heard submissions  from  both  representatives,  I  reserved  my
    decision.

    submissions

 6. MR KAIHIVA  ADOPTED  HIS  SKELETON  ARGUMENT  THAT  HE  HANDED  TO  THE
    TRIBUNAL.  HE ALSO ADOPTED THE GROUNDS OF  APPEAL  AND  SUBMITTED  THAT
    THERE HAD BEEN TWO MATERIAL ERRORS IN LAW AND THAT THE DECISION  SHOULD
    BE SET ASIDE AND REMADE.

 7. His first argument, which formed ground one of his grounds  of  appeal,
    was that the Judge  had  materially  erred  in  paragraph  6.4  of  her
    decision in finding that the appellant had failed to  provide  evidence
    of employment.  With regard to this ground, Mr Kaihiva pointed  out  to
    me that there were a number of wage slips at pages 89  and  90  of  the
    original bundle and these wage slips suggested that her employment  had
    begun in December 2013 and bearing in mind the wage slip for  September
    2014 showed an income in excess of �3,700 and the wage  slip  confirmed
    that she began her employment on December 16,  2013  it  was  submitted
    that the Judge had erred in  finding  that  she  had  not  complied  or
    satisfied Regulation 10(6) of the 2006  Regulations.   That  Regulation
    required the appellant to be working when the marriage  terminated  and
    he submitted this evidence, albeit limited,  should  have  led  to  the
    Judge making a finding  that  she  had  been  working.  The  Judge  had
    accepted the marriage had existed for  more  than  three  years  before
    termination and that they had lived together for twelve months  in  the
    United Kingdom and in those circumstances the Judge, at the very least,
    should have found that the appellant was a person who had retained  the
    right of residence. By failing to do so the Judge erred in law.

 8. The second ground of appeal related  to  the  Judge's  misdirection  in
    respect of permanent residence.  He  submitted  that  under  Regulation
    15(1)(f) the appellant was  entitled  to  permanent  residence  if  she
    demonstrated she had resided in the United Kingdom in  accordance  with
    these Regulations for  a  continuous  period  of  five  years  and  had
    retained the right  of  residence  at  the  end  of  that  period.   He
    submitted that there was oral evidence from  the  appellant  concerning
    her former spouse's employment and there was  evidence  in  the  bundle
    from page 21 to page 33 of his employment between 2013  and  2015.   He
    submitted the Regulation was met.

 9. Mr Tufan objected to the application and submitted that the finding  by
    the Judge regarding the appellant's income was a finding open to her on
    the evidence.  It  was  up  to  the  appellant  to  provide  sufficient
    evidence and although he accepted  it  was  not  necessary  to  provide
    evidence all the way back to 2013 he submitted there were no wage slips
    between the date of divorce (April 2014) and September 2014 to  support
    the wage slip relied on and it followed the Judge was entitled to  find
    she had not satisfied Regulation 10 of the 2006 Regulations.

10. On the second issue Mr Tufan submitted that there was a total  lack  of
    evidence that the appellant's former spouse had been working  prior  to
    the divorce save for the period March 2013 to April 2014.  The Tribunal
    in the decision of OA (EEA  -  retained  right  of  residence)  Nigeria
    [2010] UKAIT 00003 clarified the position regarding both Regulation  10
    and Regulation 15 of the 2006 Regulations.

    findings

11. IN GRANTING PERMISSION TO APPEAL DESIGNATED  JUDGE  OF  THE  FIRST-TIER
    TRIBUNAL MACDONALD FOUND SIMPLY THAT IT WAS ARGUABLE THAT THE JUDGE HAD
    ERRED IN LAW.  NO FURTHER EXPLANATION WAS GIVEN FOR THOSE REASONS.

12. During the appeal hearing I raised with  the  two  representatives  the
    issues that needed to be considered and it was agreed  that  the  first
    issue that this Tribunal had to address his mind to was whether or  not
    the appellant was entitled to a retained right of residence.

13. The relevant Regulation that needs  to  be  considered  is  Regulations
    10(5) of the 2006 Regulations.  Regulation 10(5) states  that  where  a
    person has ceased to be a family member of a qualified person  and  was
    residing in the United Kingdom in accordance with these Regulations  at
    the date of divorce and she was working then as long  as  the  marriage
    has lasted for three years and they had spent one year  in  the  United
    Kingdom she was entitled to a retained right of residence.

14. In her decision the Judge stated at paragraph 6.4,  "there  were  clear
    gaps in the appellant's own employment history between 2013  and  2014.
    The only evidence that she was  working  in  2014  were  payslips  from
    October 2014 some seven months after her divorce."

15. I have referred myself to the relevant bundle  of  documents  and  note
    that the payslip that was  issued  on  October  3,  2014  included  the
    following information:

 a) She commenced work at AIM Commercial Cleaning Limited on  December  16,
    2013.

 b) For the month of September she had been  paid  net  �536.34  and  gross
    �680.80.

 c) Her gross pay to date was �3,727.12 with  tax  and  national  insurance
    deductions of �753.66.

16. The Judge's conclusion that there was no evidence  that  she  had  been
    exercising treaty rights since the termination of her  marriage  cannot
    be sustained. The payslips in the bundle clearly demonstrated that  the
    appellant commenced work in that job on December  16,  2013  and  I  am
    satisfied the Judge should have found that she was working at the  date
    of the termination of the marriage and  continued  to  be  so  employed
    after that date.

17. I therefore find that there was a material error on  this  first  issue
    and the appellant is entitled to a residence card based on  a  retained
    right of residence.

18. I turn to the second issue as  to  whether  or  not  the  appellant  is
    entitled  to  permanent  residence.   Regulation  15(1)(f)  contains  a
    twofold test. Firstly, the appellant has to show that she  has  resided
    in the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations  for  a
    continuous period of five years and secondly, that she is  someone  who
    at the end of that period had retained a right of residence.

19. It seems that  my  finding  concerning  her  retained  residence  above
    addresses the second part of the test  so  the  issue  is  whether  she
    satisfied the first part of that test. The Judge was not satisfied  she
    did and gave her reasons and it is those reasons that  Mr  Kaihiva  has
    challenged.

20. The appellant was able to  provide  evidence  that  her  former  spouse
    worked between March 2013 and April 2014 but she was unable to  provide
    any further documentary evidence of his employment prior to this  date.
    It may well be that there is further evidence available  to  show  this
    but at the date the appeal was heard there was no documentary  evidence
    that the former spouse was exercising treaty rights before April  2013.
    There was oral evidence from  the  appellant  but  the  Judge  was  not
    satisfied on balance that this was sufficient.

21. In Amos v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department;  Theophilus  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  552  the
    Court of Appeal held that a divorced spouse had to establish that he or
    she  had  the  right  of  residence  before   the   question   whether,
    notwithstanding the divorce, the right had been retained by Article  13
    of the Citizens Directive could be determined. The right was subject to
    Articles 16(2) or 18 of the Citizens Directive.  The  former  provision
    applied to family members of EEA nationals who must have  resided  with
    the EEA national in the host Member  State  legally  for  a  continuous
    period of five years. The word "legally" had to be  given  a  Community
    meaning, which essentially depended on the exercise of Treaty rights.

22. In Diatta v Land Berlin (Case 267/83) the  European  Court  of  Justice
    concluded that the Claimants were  not  required  to  show  that  their
    former spouses were working for a continuous period of five years prior
    to their  applications  for  the  right  of  permanent  residence.  The
    requirements of the Citizens Directive applicable to the Claimants were
    that at all times while residing in the  UK  until  their  divorce  the
    spouse had to be a worker  or  self-employed  (or  otherwise  satisfied
    Article 7(1) of the Citizens Directive);  the  marriages  had  to  have
    lasted at least three years, including one year in the UK, and they had
    to show that they were workers, self-employed  or  otherwise  satisfied
    the penultimate paragraph of Article 13(2). Provided the conditions  in
    regulation  10(5)  continued  to  be  satisfied,  after   five   years'
    continuous residence in the UK, a non-EEA national would be entitled to
    a permanent right of residence under regulation 15(1)(f)  (paras  29  -
    31). Under regulation 10 of the 2006 Regulations, the ex-spouse  of  an
    EEA national continues to enjoy a right of residence if he was residing
    in the UK in accordance with the  Regulations  when  the  marriage  was
    terminated (i.e. the decree of divorce  was  made  absolute),  and  the
    marriage had lasted for three years, at least one of which was spent by
    both parties in the UK.

23. How does all this affect the appellant. Put simply the appellant had to
    show the following:

 a) Her former husband must have been exercising Treaty rights  up  to  the
    date of the divorce, but thereafter that is not required. The  evidence
    she adduced supports this as the tax returns show he was working up  to
    and including the date of the divorce.

 b) What is required is that, after the divorce, the appellant must herself
    exercise 'Treaty rights', in the sense  of  being  a  worker  or  self-
    employed or self-sufficient.  That is set out  at  Article  13  of  the
    Citizens Directive, and is reproduced at regulation 10(6) of  the  2006
    Regulations. This was also demonstrated by the appellant  as  evidenced
    by my finding above.

 c) To obtain permanent residence the appellant has to  show  that  between
    them they  have  been  living  here  continuously  for  five  years  in
    accordance with the Regulations.

 d) Once she demonstrates five years between them which in this case  would
    be April 2018 she  would  be  entitled  to  permanent  residence  under
    Regulation 15(1)(f) of the 2006 Regulations.

24. The appellant cannot show a full five  years  continuous  residence  in
    accordance with the Regulations and the Judge was therefore entitled to
    find she was not entitled to permanent residence.

25.  The  argument  presented  today  by  Mr  Kaihiva  amounts  to  a  mere
    disagreement with that finding.  The mere fact there had been an  error
    on the right of residence does  not  mean  the  decision  on  permanent
    residence contained a similar error.  The test and the requirements are
    different.

Decision

The making of the First-tier Tribunal did involve a partial  error  of  law.
I have set aside the original decision and I have  remade  the  decision  as
follows:

 a) I find the appellant is entitled to a retained right of residence under
    Regulation 10(5) of the 2006  Regulations  and  the  respondent  should
    issue her with a residence card accordingly.

 b) I find there was no error  of  law  with  regard  to  the  granting  of
    permanent residence under Regulation 15 of the 2006 Regulations  and  I
    uphold that part of the Judge's decision.
