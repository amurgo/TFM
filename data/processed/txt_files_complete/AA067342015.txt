For the Appellant:     Mr S Vokes of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a  citizen  of  Mongolia,  born  on  [  ]  1983.   She
    appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent taken on 1st April, 2015, to direct  her  removal  from  the
    United Kingdom.  The appellant arrived in the United  Kingdom  on  30th
    October, 2009.  She was in possession of a student  visa  made  on  6th
    October, 2009, expiring on 6th October, 2010.  On  6th  October,  2010,
    she made an application for leave to remain which was  refused  on  9th
    November, 2010, although the appellant says that she  did  not  receive
    the decision letter.

2.   Whilst in the United Kingdom the appellant met her husband,  [HK],  who
    had been granted refugee status in 2001.  They met in 2010 and in  2012
    they were married in a Muslim ceremony and subsequently  married  under
    United Kingdom law on 29th July, 2014.  On [ ] 2014, their son [D]  was
    born.  Because [D]'s father had settled status as a refugee, [D]  is  a
    British subject.  It appears that  the  fact  that  [D]  is  a  British
    subject may have been overlooked previously by the Respondent.

3.   At the hearing before me today Mr Vokes drew  my  attention  to  policy
    guidance in respect to Appendix FM, paragraph 11.2.3, "where a decision
    to refuse the application would require a parent or  primary  carer  to
    return to a country outside the EU".  The case must always be  assessed
    on the basis that it would be unreasonable to expect a British  citizen
    child to leave the EU with that parent or primary carer.

4.   Recognising that this policy was applicable Mr Harrison, quite  rightly
    in my view, indicated to me that he  agreed  that  the  appeal  of  the
    appellant should be allowed.  This determination is written as a matter
    of record.  I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.
    The appellant's appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

The appellant's appeal is allowed.
