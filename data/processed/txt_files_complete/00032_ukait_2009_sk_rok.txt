Representation:

For the Appellant:       Ms V Laughton, instructed by Messrs Penningtons
For the Respondent:  Ms J Isherwood, Presenting Officer

The transitional provision concerning maintenance under Tier 1  (Post  Study
Work), for those with  previous  leave  under  the  International  Graduates
Scheme, only applies to applications made on or before 31 October  2008.  It
has not been extended and there is no legitimate expectation that it  should
have been.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   The Issues

   1. The Appellant is a citizen of South Korea who has  obtained  an  order
      for reconsideration of the determination of Immigration  Judge  Scott-
      Baker, who on the papers dismissed the Appellant's appeal against  the
      decision of the Respondent on 19 December 2008 to refuse to  vary  her
      leave to remain in United Kingdom.


   2. The Appellant has been in the UK since September 2003. She  had  leave
      as a student until on 5 December 2007, when she was granted  leave  to
      remain under the International Graduates Scheme ("IGS").  The IGS  and
      other similar schemes were replaced by a new points based  scheme  for
      Tier 1 (Post Study Work), which came into force on 30 June  2008.  The
      provisions of the new scheme are contained in  paragraphs  245V,  245Z
      and 245ZA of the Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules  (HC395
      as amended). Paragraph 245Z(e) requires  a  sufficiency  of  funds  as
      specified in Appendix C of the Rules.  Transitional  arrangements  for
      those who were already here on the discontinued schemes  such  as  the
      IGS (as opposed to initial applicants) are set out in  various  policy
      guidance documents issued by the  Respondent.  One  such  transitional
      arrangement relates to sufficiency of funds (generally referred to  as
      "maintenance").

   3. The Immigration Judge concluded that the Appellant did not fall within
      the terms of the transitional arrangements  relating  to  maintenance,
      and did not meet the new maintenance  requirements  under  the  points
      based system either. Therefore on this basis she dismissed the appeal.



   4. The Appellant's grounds for reconsideration, as argued before me by Ms
      Laughton, assert first that the Judge was in material error of law  in
      concluding that the transitional arrangements on maintenance  did  not
      apply to the Appellant. Ms Laughton maintained that  the  transitional
      arrangements applied to those who were in the UK and whose last  grant
      of leave was under the IGS and was due to expire after 30  June  2008.
      The Appellant fulfilled these requirements as her last leave to remain
      was granted under the  IGS  and  was  valid  until  2  December  2008.
      Moreover she met all the substantive requirements of the  transitional
      provisions,  including,  for  the  purpose  of   this   hearing,   the
      requirement in respect of maintenance, which demanded  a  single  bank
      statement with a closing balance of not less than �800 at any time  in
      the 30 days prior to the presentation of the application. Because  she
      was eligible for the transitional arrangements on maintenance, she did
      not have to meet the normal  maintenance  requirement  under  the  new
      scheme which would require her to have had a minimum balance  of  �800
      throughout  the  three  months  prior  to  the  presentation  of   her
      application, which would be  the  position  outside  the  transitional
      arrangements. Alternatively Ms Laughton argued that the Appellant  had
      a legitimate expectation that she would be entitled to the benefit  of
      the  transitional  arrangements  for   maintenance.   As   a   further
      alternative, Ms Laughton argued that the Respondent's  decision  would
      be in breach of the Appellant's Article 8 rights.

   The Reconsideration Hearing

   5. Before me, both Representatives agreed that the closing balance in the
      last  bank  statement  of  the  Appellant  prior  to  her  making  her
      application to the Respondent on 27 November 2008 was  �994.45.   This
      was the closing balance in a statement dated 13  November  2008.  Both
      Representatives agreed further that if the  transitional  arrangements
      did apply to the Appellant then she had discharged her burden of proof
      with regard to maintenance and her appeal should be allowed  as  there
      was no other issue arising.

   6. Ms Isherwood accepted that the Appellant was entitled to  the  benefit
      of transitional arrangements relating to the closure of the  IGS.  She
      had benefited from them by being able to make  her  application  under
      Tier 1, without the need to satisfy the new requirements in respect of
      attributes and command of English, as set out in Appendices A and B of
      the Rules. However, Ms  Isherwood  maintained  that  the  transitional
      arrangement for maintenance under the  new  points  based  system  was
      separate and distinct and was expressly available only  to  those  who
      had submitted their applications within the United Kingdom up  to  and
      including 31 October 2008.

   7. Ms Laughton helpfully provided a skeleton argument and produced in her
      bundle of documents a guidance note from UKBA at page 34, and five  e-
      mails (pages 26-29)  from  December  2008  to  February  2008  between
      enquirers and the UKBA concerning the transitional  arrangements.  She
      maintained that these  e-mails  supported  her  submissions  that  the
      transitional arrangement relating to maintenance had continued  beyond
      31 October 2008 or alternatively that the Respondent  had  created  by
      these documents a legitimate expectation that they would.

   8. The Guidance Note to which she referred is from IND and  was  dated  2
      June 2009. It stated:

           "If you have a valid leave to remain under IGS or SEGS  [Science
           and Engineering Graduates Scheme] ... on or after 30  June  2008
           you will be able to apply to extend your permission to  stay  in
           your existing category. You will not be  required  to  meet  the
           points requirement if you are applying under  this  transitional
           arrangement.    You   can   apply   under   these   transitional
           arrangements at any time from 30 June 2008.  If your application
           is successful you will receive an extra year from the date  your
           visa is due to expire.  You will need to  use  application  form
           Tier 1 (Post Study Work) ..."

      With regard to the e-mails, Ms Laughton in her oral submissions seemed
      to imply that some are specific responses to others. However I  should
      observe at this point that I do not consider  this  is  so.  They  are
      arranged in reverse date order. The names of the enquirers  have  been
      blanked out and cannot therefore be matched. However, if one looks  at
      the dates of the respective e-mails and their contents,  none  of  the
      five appear to relate directly to any other.  They  are  in  effect  a
      collage of separate enquiries and responses. Ms Laughton  referred  me
      to the two e-mails on page 28 of her bundle which refer  expressly  to
      maintenance. As it is not alleged that the Appellant was  herself  the
      enquirer in question in any these e-mails, I have treated them all  as
      being Representative of the type of correspondence being generated  at
      the time. The first e-mail on page 28 is from an enquirer as follows:-





           "4 December 2008


           Thanks a lot for your response.  My  case  falls  in  below  the
           category  "Tier  1  (Post  Study  Work)  -  IGS  -  Transitional
           Arrangement". And as per automated response, there are no points
           requirements to be met, which means  not  even  for  maintenance
           requirement.  Am I correct in understanding this?

                 "Tier  1  (Posed  Study  Work)   -   IGS   -   Transitional
                 Arrangement
                 If your leave to remain on the basis of IGS or SEGS expires
                 before 30 June 2008,  you  will  not  be  eligible  for  an
                 extension under Points Based  System  Tier  1  (Post  Study
                 Work).
                 If you have valid leave to remain under IGS on or after  30
                 June 2008  you  will  be  able  to  apply  to  extend  your
                 permission to stay in your existing category.  You will not
                 be required to meet  the  points  requirement  if  you  are
                 applying under  this  transitional  arrangement.   You  can
                 apply under these transitional  arrangements  at  any  time
                 from 30 June 2008. If your application  is  successful  you
                 will receive an extra year from the date your visa  is  due
                 to expire.  You will need to use application  form  Tier  1
                 (Posed Study Work), which is available  on  the  UK  Border
                 Agency                      website                      at
                 www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/workingintheuk/tier1/poststudy""


      The IND e-mail is a reply on this issue albeit  to  someone  else  who
      would seem to have raised a similar question. It states as follows:

            "3 December 2008
           Thank you for your inquiry.
           When  applying  for  Tier  1  (Post  Study  Work)  or   Tier   1
           (Entrepreneur)  from  within  United  Kingdom,  applicants   are
           required to submit documents showing they have had statement  of
           at least �800 for at least three months before applying.  If the
           balance has dipped below �800 during the three-month period  the
           maintenance requirement will not be met."

   9. Ms Laughton submitted that the reference to  "not  being  required  to
      meet the points requirement" in the automated response cited in  these
      e-mails (which were dated in December 2008) included  maintenance  and
      demonstrated that whatever the position might  have  been  previously,
      transitional arrangements had been extended beyond 31 October 2008  to
      cover anybody who had extant leave under the  IGS  expiring  after  30
      June 2008. Obviously an application for extension  would  have  to  be
      made during the currency of the extant leave.  In the alternative, she
      submitted that the Appellant had a legitimate expectation in the light
      of the ambiguity in the documents referred to above that she would  be
      entitled to apply under the transitional arrangement  on  maintenance,
      and also that the refusal of  the  Appellant's  application  in  these
      circumstances was in breach of the Appellant's article 8 rights.


  10. Ms Isherwood was unaware of the specific e-mails  relied  upon  by  Ms
      Laughton and sought time to make further inquiries concerning  whether
      there had been any extension of the transitional arrangements relating
      to maintenance and if so whether they applied  to  the  Appellant.   I
      agreed to give each Representative the opportunity to  submit  further
      evidence and written submissions to me and to the other party on  this
      point by e-mail within seven days of the date of the hearing. I  would
      then  consider  whether  to   proceed   directly   to   promulgate   a
      determination or whether, in the interests  of  justice,  any  further
      hearing would be required.

   The Written Submissions

  11. In the event I received written submissions from both Representatives.
      Neither sought any further oral hearing and I did  not  consider  that
      one would be necessary given the comprehensiveness of  the  respective
      written submissions.

  12.  Ms Isherwood's written submissions were as follows.


           "INTRODUCTION


           1. On the 27th November 2008 the appellant applied to extend her
              leave as a Tier 1 (Post Study Work)  Migrant.  The  appellant
              was issued with a refusal letter on the 19th  December  2008.
              The appellant could not demonstrate  that  she  had  been  in
              possession of the  �800  for  the  period  specified  in  the
              guidance.


           2. The appellant appealed  and  in  a  matter  decided  "on  the
              papers" on  the  26th  March  Immigration  Judge  Scott-Baker
              dismissed the appeal.


           3.  The  appellant  sought  reconsideration  for  the  following
              reasons:


                 a. The IJ erred in law  in  stating  that  the  appellant's
                    application  had  fallen  outside  of  the  transitional
                    arrangements
                 b. The IJ erred in failing  to  have  regard  to  the  bank
                    statements submitted by the appellant
                 c. The IJ erred in law for  failing  to  give  any  or  any
                    adequate reasons for concluding that removal  would  not
                    be disproportionate


           4. Reconsideration  was  ordered  by  Senior  Immigration  Judge
              Spencer on the 29th April, stating


                    'It is  arguable  that  the  Immigration  Judge  made  a
                    material error in law in concluding that  the  appellant
                    fell outside the  transitional  arrangements  for  those
                    with  leave  under  the  International  Graduate  Scheme
                    (IGS)'


           5. At an initial error in law hearing before Senior  Immigration
              Judge Batiste on the 8th June 2009, clarification was  sought
              on what maintenance transitional provisions  were  applicable
              to applicants previously granted under  IGS.  There  appeared
              some confusion over the relevance of:


                 a. The original  transitional arrangements for maintenance,
                    which stated:


                         'Up to 31 October 2008, you do not  have  to  show
                         you have had the funds for at least  three  months
                         before your application. You must  only  show  you
                         have the required funds at the time you apply.....
                         However, until 31October 2008, they do not need to
                         cover the three month period,  but  they  must  be
                         dated  no  more   than   a   month   before   your
                         application'; and


                 b. The transitional arrangements relating  specifically  to
                    IGS applicants.


           6. The original transitional  arrangement  for  maintenance  was
              introduced because it could not  be  expected  that  migrants
              would  anticipate  the  incoming  criteria.   However,   this
              transitional period ended on 31 October  2008.  No  applicant
              could make use of  this  transitional  arrangement  after  31
              October 2008 under any circumstances. The  Tier 1 (Post-study
              Work) Guidance - under the Rules the authoritative source  of
              information as to the requirements -  has always stated  that
              IGS  transitional   users   must   satisfy   the   prevailing
              maintenance requirements. Whilst other information  from  the
              UK Border Agency may have given a  contrary  impression  this
              was neither unambiguous nor plainly authoritative such as  to
              demonstrate  a  policy  position  or  create   a   legitimate
              expectation.


           7. For these reasons the Respondent's position is that IJ Scott-
              Baker did not  materially  err  in  law  in  maintaining  the
              refusal to extend the appellant's leave to remain.


           Ground 1: That the appellant's case did not - as found - fall
           outside  Transitional Arrangements


           8. The central issue for this ground is whether the appellant in
              fact meets the Maintenance requirement to enable  her  to  be
              awarded 10 points for funds under Appendix C.


           9.  The  appellant  plainly  falls   within   the   transitional
              provisions for a person  granted  leave  under  IGS  and  was
              accordingly awarded 75 points under the  Attributes  section.
              The refusal letter states 'Points awarded as claimed  as  per
              the transitional arrangements of the International  Graduates
              Scheme'.


          10. The appellant's position is that she did not have to meet the
              maintenance requirement under the IGS transitional  provision
              because that provision removed the need to do so. It does not
              appear to be her case  -  nor,  it  is  submitted,  could  it
              reasonably be so - that she was entitled to benefit from  the
              original  transitional  provision  on  Maintenance.  This  is
              wholly in accordance with IJ Scott-Baker's finding that  'The
              appellant had made  her  application  in  November  2008  and
              therefore had fallen outside the transitional provisions'.


          11. Additionally, the Guidance as at November 2008, handed in  at
              the error in law hearing, makes a clear  distinction  between
              points scored in initial  applications   and   points  scored
              under the transitional arrangements. The distinctions are set
              out  for  Attributes,  English  Language  Requirement.   With
              regards to  the  Maintenance  requirement,  page  19  of  the
              guidance,  it   states   'Maintenance   requirement   -   all
              applications'.  There  are   no   transitional   arrangements
              provided. This means that regardless of your application  the
              appellant has to meet the maintenance requirement.  Also, the
              appropriate application form reflects  the  same  information
              (A1 to A28  of  the  Respondent's  Bundle).  The  Maintenance
              section  is  at  A22  and  no  transitional  provisions   are
              expressed.


          12. Applying the correct guidance the IJ found that on  a  number
              of occasions in the required period  the  appellant's  saving
              fell below �800.


          13. The appellant seeks to rely on automated  e-mails  apparently
              from other cases to claim that under the Respondent's  policy
              she does not have to meet the Maintenance requirement.


          14. These e-mails may be ambiguous. They state:


                 "Tier  1  (Post  Study   Work)   -   IGS   -   Transitional
                 Arrangements"


                 'You will not be required to meet the points requirement if
                 you are applying under this transitional arrangements'




          15. Plainly the phrase "the points  requirement"  is  significant
              and  open  to  different  interpretations.  The  Tribunal  is
              invited to note that  the  word  "requirement"  is  singular.
              Furthermore the e-mail does not say "any" points requirement.
              As  stated  above,  the  IGS  transitional  arrangements  are
              clearly expressed in both the Guidance  and  the  application
              form as applying only to the Attributes test. Whilst  the  e-
              mail may be ambiguously worded it does  not,  on  any  proper
              reading  of  all  available   material,   provide   a   clear
              declaration that the Maintenance requirement need not be met.


          16. The  appellant  claims  in  the  alternative  the  legitimate
              expectation of not having to meet the maintenance requirement
              given what  is  said  in  the  e-mails.  As  above,  no  such
              expectation derives from considering all of  the  expressions
              of the UKBA's  policy  position.  At  best  the  position  is
              unclear; at worst (for the Appellant) it is abundantly  clear
              from the Guidance and the application form,  which  refer  to
              the IGS transitional provision in respect of  the  Attributes
              test only.


          17. The Respondent notes that not to require an IGS applicant  to
              meet maintenance would create the extraordinary position of a
              penniless applicant being entitled to  remain  if  all  other
              requirements were met.


          18. For the Tribunal's information,  the  UKBA  has  amended  the
              automatic e-mail with effect from 19 May  2009.  The  revised
              version is attached. This makes  it  clear  that  maintenance
              does  need  to  be  met.  Lest  it  be  suggested  that  this
              represents a  change  of  position,  it  is  noted  that  the
              Guidance has not been amended at the same time.


           Ground 2 - Failing to have regard to the bank statements
           submitted by the appellant



          19. It is plain from  the  statements  in  the  bundle  that  the
              Appellant did not hold the required �800 throughout the three
              month period prior to the application. Thus  any  failure  to
              have regard to those statements could not be material.


           Ground 3 - Failing to give any or any adequate reasons for
           concluding that removal would not be disproportionate


          20.  It is acknowledged that the IJ's reasoning in dismissing the
              appeal under Article 8 is wholly deficient. It is in  no  way
              satisfactory to say that simple failure to meet the Rules  is
              dispositive of Article 8.


          21. The Tribunal is asked to consider  whether  this  is  on  any
              reading a case that was bound to be dismissed  under  Article
              8. The Appellant's protected Article 8(1)  private  life  has
              been formed when her immigration status was that of a  person
              expected to leave at the end of her stay, first as a  student
              then under the  International  Graduate  Scheme.  Indeed  the
              instant application was on a basis with a strict time  limit.
              It is difficult to  see  that  legitimate  interference  with
              private life formed  in  such  circumstances  (based  on  the
              Tribunal's acceptance of the Respondent's case on  Ground  1)
              can possibly have consequences of such gravity as  to  engage
              Article 8 notwithstanding what is said in AG (Eritrea).


          22. If further  consideration  of  Article  8  is  required,  the
              Respondent also asks that the submissions above in respect of
              the position on needing to meet Maintenance requirements  are
              considered.  The  Appellant's   grounds   allege   that   the
              Respondent has "misled" the  Appellant  into  believing  that
              this was not so: this is denied.

          23. It is for these reasons that the IJ did not materially err in
              law in dismissing the appeal. "

  13.  Ms Laughton replied to these written  submissions  in  the  following
      terms.

           "INTRODUCTION


              1. The Appellant is a citizen of  South  Korea.  She  appeared
                 before SIJ Batiste on 8th June 2009 for  a  reconsideration
                 hearing of the decision of IJ Scott-Baker dated 26th  March
                 2009 refusing the Appellant's appeal against a  refusal  to
                 vary leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post Study Work)  Migrant
                 dated 19th December 2008. At the conclusion of the hearing,
                 SIJ Batiste  gave  either  side  7  days  to  make  further
                 submissions and lodge any further evidence in  relation  to
                 the existence of any policy  relating  to  the  Appellant's
                 case. The Respondent's submissions  were  received  by  the
                 Appellant on 15th June 2008. These  submissions  have  been
                 prepared in response on the next working day.


              2. It should be noted that the  Respondent's  submissions  are
                 wider than merely considering the existence of the  policy.
                 The Appellant relies upon all of the arguments submitted in
                 the  skeleton  argument  at  the  reconsideration  hearing,
                 including the fact that as the Respondent had not submitted
                 a  reply  under  Rule  30,  he  should  be  prevented  from
                 asserting that there was no material error of law.


              3. The Appellant does not intend  to  rehearse  the  arguments
                 contained within the skeleton argument and merely  responds
                 to the specific points raised  by  the  Respondent  in  the
                 written submissions.


           GROUND 1 - The IJ erred in law in stating that  the  Appellant's
           application had fallen outside of the transitional arrangements.


              4. The Appellant submitted clear  evidence  that  transitional
                 arrangements in place meant that as she had leave to remain
                 under the IGS, she did not have to satisfy the points based
                 requirement. The  Transitional  Arrangements  described  in
                 guidance issued by the UK Border Agency dated 28th  January
                 2009 state (page 34 of AB):

                 "Tier 1 (Post Study Work) - IGS - Transitional Arrangement
                       If your leave to remain on the basis of IGS  or  SEGS
                       expired before  30th  June  2008,  you  will  not  be
                       eligible to apply for an extension under Points Based
                       System Tier 1 (Post Study Work).


                       If you have valid leave to remain under IGS  or  SEGS
                       on or after 30th June 2008, you will be able to apply
                       to extend your permission to stay  in  your  existing
                       category. You will not be required to meet the points
                       requirement  if   you   are   applying   under   this
                       transitional arrangement.'


              5. The Respondent asserts that these e mails may be ambiguous.
                 It is difficult to see how  there  is  any  ambiguity.  The
                 maintenance requirements  are  part  of  the  points  based
                 system. There was  no  suggestion  that  this  policy  only
                 related to attributes and English language requirements. If
                 maintenance   was   excluded    from    the    transitional
                 arrangements, one would expect this to be stated.  Further,
                 the Respondent has failed to comment  upon  the  fact  that
                 there was a further email dated 8 December  2008  by  Wayne
                 Fairweather of Immigration Group, UK Border  Agency   in  a
                 response to an enquiry as  to  whether  an  individual  who
                 applied under the transitional arrangements would  need  to
                 meet the maintenance points requirement under Tier 1  (page
                 27 of AB);


                       "If you have valid leave to remain under IGS or  SEGS
                       on or after 30th June 2008, you will be able to apply
                       to extend your permission to stay  in  your  existing
                       category.  You will  not  be  required  to  meet  the
                       points requirement if you  are  applying  under  this
                       transitional arrangement.  You can apply  at  anytime
                       under this transitional arrangement  from  30th  June
                       2008.  If your application  is  successful  you  will
                       receive an extra year from the date your visa is  due
                       to expire.  You will need  to  use  application  form
                       Tier 1 (Post Study Work), which is available...


                       If your application is successful you will be granted
                       further leave to remain, up to a  combined  total  of
                       two years in your  existing  category  and  the  Post
                       Study Work category, during which time  you  will  be
                       free to seek employment without having a sponsor..."


              6. It should  be  noted  that  this  response  was  in  direct
                 response to a query as to  whether  an  individual  had  to
                 fulfil the maintenance requirements  of  the  points  based
                 system (see page 28 and  26  of  AB).  It  is  respectfully
                 submitted that the position could not be any clearer. It is
                 therefore clear that those applying under the  transitional
                 arrangements (such  as  the  Appellant)  did  not  need  to
                 satisfy the points based requirements, including the points
                 relating to maintenance.


              7. It is respectfully submitted that the  Respondent  has  not
                 placed any evidence before the court to counteract  such  a
                 clear expression of policy. The document submitted with the
                 Respondent's submissions entitled auto response message  is
                 dated 19th May 2009 and therefore post dates  the  date  of
                 application and refusal.  The  fact  that  the  policy  now
                 states that the Appellant must still meet  the  maintenance
                 requirement is irrelevant, as it was not in  force  at  the
                 relevant time. If anything, the fact  that  the  Respondent
                 has  drastically  changed  the  wording  leads  one  to  an
                 irresistible inference that  it  constitutes  a  change  in
                 policy.


              8. In the alternative the Appellant relies upon the  arguments
                 regarding legitimate expectation contained in paragraph  15
                 to 21 of the skeleton argument.


           Ground 3 - The IJ erred in law for failing to give  any  or  any
           adequate reasons  for  concluding  that  removal  would  not  be
           disproportionate


              9. The Respondent accepts that the IJ erred in law in relation
                 to her consideration under Article 8, but asserts that  the
                 ground is bound to fail. The  Appellant  asserts  that  the
                 error is clearly material and would not be  bound  to  fail
                 and relies  upon  paragraphs  23  to  34  of  the  skeleton
                 argument. In response to the allegation that the  Appellant
                 was expected to leave at the conclusion of her student visa
                 and/or IGS, the whole point of IGS and the subsequent  Tier
                 1 system was to attract the most attractive  candidates  to
                 the UK and encourage then to remain.


           Conclusion


             10. The learned SIJ is  respectfully  requested  to  allow  the
                 appeal outright."


   The Context of the Rule Changes in June 2008 and  the  associated  Policy
   Guidance of the Respondent


  14. In considering these submissions, I have first assessed the context of
      the material rule changes introduced  in  June  2008.   Prior  to  the
      change, the Rules provided for a variety  of  schemes  for  which  the
      requirements to be satisfied were often  expressed  in  general  terms
      which were subject to interpretation and  hence  to  inconsistency  in
      application. The new points based system provides for 5 Tiers in  all,
      of which  Tier  1  replaced  the  IGS,  the  Science  and  Engineering
      Graduates Scheme (SEGS) and the  Fresh  Talent:  Working  In  Scotland
      Scheme (FT:WISS). These schemes were discontinued in June 2008 and the
      new points based system was introduced  in  their  place.  There  were
      additional  requirements  to  be  satisfied  by  applicants,  such  as
      attributes and command of English. A further very important change was
      that applications would henceforth be judged objectively on the  basis
      of clearly specified criteria awarding points in specific  categories.
      Successful candidates had to  demonstrate  their  entitlement  to  the
      required number of points.


  15. At all times a distinction was drawn between  initial  applicants  for
      Tier 1 Post Study Work and those applicants who were  already  in  IGS
      (SEGS) and FT:WISS. This was because it was  understood  by  the  UKBA
      that changes of  this  magnitude  could  produce  material  unfairness
      without appropriate arrangements to smooth out the  transition.   Some
      of those transitional arrangements  related  to  the  consequences  of
      withdrawal of the old schemes and the switch  to  a  different  points
      based  system.  Others  related  to  the  new  objective  methods   of
      evaluation of matters such as maintenance under Appendix C.

  16. The "guidance" referred to in Appendix C is a reference  to  the  UKBA
      Policy Guidance contained in the document entitled "Tier 1 (Post-Study
      Work) of the Points-Based  System  -  Policy  Guidance".  This  Policy
      Guidance has evolved. The first version  (version  06/08)  was  issued
      with the introduction of the  scheme  on  30  June  2008.  The  second
      version (version 09/08) was issued  on  11  September  2008  and  made
      changes  to  the  section  entitled   "Tier   1   (Post-study   Work):
      Maintenance". It included a  new  page  at  the  end  in  a  different
      typeface headed "Transitional arrangements for  maintenance  (funds)".
      This is the version in force when the Appellant made  her  application
      to the Respondent on 25 November 2008. Given the limited nature of the
      issues before me, I shall now focus on the issue  of  maintenance  for
      applicants whose previous leave was under the IGS. However,  I  should
      briefly record for the sake of completeness that further versions were
      published later and that there were different transitional  provisions
      for applicants whose previous leave was under the IGS to  those  whose
      previous leave was under the FT:WISS.

  17. The Policy Guidance for those applying after 31 October 2008  required
      as follows.


                "89. One of the requirements of Tier 1 is that an  applicant
                coming to the UK must be able to support himself/herself for
                the entire duration of his/her stay in the UK without use of
                public funds (benefits provided by the state). An  applicant
                who  is  unable  to  support  himself/herself   could   face
                financial hardship because he/she will not  have  access  to
                most state benefits.


                90. In order to qualify for entry  clearance,  or  leave  to
                remain under Tier 1 an applicant must show that  he/she  has
                enough money to  support  himself/herself.  The  maintenance
                requirements are detailed below:


                        . Applicants outside the UK seeking entry  clearance
                          must have at  least  �2,800  of  personal  savings
                          which must have  been  held  for  at  least  three
                          months prior to the date of application.


                        . Applicants in the  UK  seeking  further  leave  to
                          remain must have at least �800 of personal savings
                          which must have  been  held  for  at  least  three
                          months prior to the date of application.
                91...


                92...


                93. The evidence to support personal savings  for  at  least
                three months must be original, on the official letter-headed
                paper or stationery of the organisation and have the  office
                stamp of that organisation. It must have been issued  by  an
                authorised official of that organisation.


                94.  Evidence must be in  the  form  of  cash  funds.  Other
                accounts or financial instruments  such  as  shares,  bonds,
                pension funds etc,  regardless  of  notice  period  are  not
                acceptable.


                95. The evidence of maintenance must be of cash funds in the
                bank (this includes savings accounts  and  current  accounts
                even when notice must be given), loan or official  financial
                or government sponsorship available to the applicant.  Other
                accounts of financial instruments  such  as  shares,  bonds,
                pensions  etc.,  regardless  of  notice  period,   are   not
                acceptable.


                96.  Only the following specified documents will be accepted
                as evidence of this requirement:


                        (i) Personal bank or  building  society  statements
                            covering the three consecutive months.


                        The most recent statement must be dated no more
                        than one calendar month before the date of
                        application.


                           The personal bank or building society  statements
                       should clearly show:
                         . The applicant's name;
                         . The account number;
                         . The date of the statement;
                         . The financial institution's name and logo;
                         . Transactions covering the three month period;
                         . That there  are  enough  funds  present  in  the
                           account (the balance must  always  be  at  least
                           �2,800 or �800, as appropriate).


                        Ad  hoc  bank  statements  printed  on  the  bank's
                        letterhead  are  admissible   as   evidence   (this
                        excludes min-statements from cash points).
                        ...  [sets  out   guidance   on   electronic   bank
                            statements]
                        We  will  not  accept  statements  which  show  the
                        balance in the account on a particular day as these
                        documents do not  show  that  the  applicant  holds
                        enough funds for the full period needed."

  18. For those applying before 1 November 2008,  the  Policy  Guidance  was
      essentially in similar terms save that the  version  of  11  September
      2008 made important additions at the beginning and at the end. At  the
      beginning it stated:


               "Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) of the points-based system  Policy
                    Guidance.


                    This document contains guidance to [sic] our  policy  on
                    Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) of the points based  system  to
                    work in the United Kingdom.


                    Maintenance   (funds)   requirement:   We   have    made
                    transitional  arrangements   for   proving   maintenance
                    (funds) for applicants and their family members who make
                    applications up to and including 31  October  2008.  You
                    can find details of these  on  the  last  page  of  this
                    document."

  19. The last page states as follows.

               "Transitional arrangements for maintenance (funds)


               Normally, when applying to Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  from
               within the United Kingdom, you will have to  show  that  you
               have enough funds, by sending documentation showing you have
               had savings of at least  �800  for  at  least  three  months
               before applying.


               Because this is a new requirement and it may be difficult to
               prove   this   immediately,   we   have   put   transitional
               arrangements  in  place  for  applicants  and  their  family
               members submitting  their  applications  within  the  United
               Kingdom up to and including 31 October 2008.


               Up to 31 October 2008, you do not have to show you have  had
               the funds for at least three months before your application.
               You must only show you have the required funds at  the  time
               you apply. The types of documentary  evidence  you  need  to
               send to support your application are as  described  in  this
               document. However, until 31 October 2008, they do  not  need
               to cover the three-month period, but they must be  dated  no
               more than a month before your application.


               For example, if you apply under Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)  on
               12 July, a single bank statement with a closing  balance  of
               �800 dated between 12 June and 12 July 2008  will  meet  the
               maintenance requirements. A bank statement dated  before  12
               June 2008 will not be acceptable."

  20. This is the context against which I now assess the submissions made to
      me.




   The Extent of the Transitional Arrangement for Maintenance


  21. It is common ground between the representatives  that  the  method  of
      evaluating the adequacy of maintenance was changed  from  the  general
      assessment of sufficiency to a very specific requirement of  having  a
      minimum of �800 in a bank account for the three months  prior  to  the
      making of the application. Obviously there needed to be a transitional
      arrangement for this as potential applicants would need  three  months
      notice of the new test so  that  they  could  organise  their  affairs
      accordingly.


  22. The Policy Guidance cited above in my  judgement  makes  unambiguously
      clear what the transitional arrangement  with  regard  to  maintenance
      was; that  it  will  only  apply  to  applications  submitted  to  the
      Respondent by 31 October 2008; why it was structured  in  the  way  it
      was; and what the requirements are for applications made on or after 1
      November 2008. I would observe  that  the  change  in  the  method  of
      evaluating the adequacy of maintenance introduced in June 2008 is  not
      inherently about the points based system as such, but rather about the
      objectivity of the evidence required to show that an applicant has met
      the maintenance requirement. By this I mean that  the  change  in  the
      method of evaluating the  adequacy  of  maintenance  is  in  substance
      distinct from the points based  system  itself.  It  could  have  been
      introduced into the old IGS without  any  points  based  system  being
      involved at all.


  23. Independently of the question of maintenance, the  withdrawal  of  the
      IGS on 30 June 2008 required its own transitional arrangement  whereby
      those who were currently in the UK with leave  under  the  scheme  but
      whose leave would not expire prior to 30 June 2008 could  nevertheless
      thereafter be enabled to make a valid in-country  application  in  the
      same category even though  the  IGS  itself  had  been  withdrawn  and
      replaced by the Tier 1 Post-Study Work scheme, set up on  a  different
      basis and with additional requirements as to attributes and command of
      English.

  24. Accordingly, those who made inquiries to the UKBA  specifically  about
      the IGS scheme would be informed, not least by the automated  response
      to an e-mail on the subject, of the transitional arrangement  relating
      to it. The reference in such e-mails to "you will not be  required  to
      meet the points  requirement  if  you  are  applying  under  this  [my
      emphasis]  transitional  arrangement"  was  directed  at  the   issues
      relating specifically to the structural transition from the IGS to the
      points  based  system  as  Ms  Isherwood  has  described,   ie  as  to
      attributes  and  command  of  English.  Those   who   enquired   about
      maintenance would be advised of the separate and distinct transitional
      arrangement relating to maintenance.

  25. Mrs Laughton has argued that in  December  2008  (i.e.  after  the  31
      October  2008  deadline)  people   asking   UKBA   about   maintenance
      specifically were given only the advice relating to the  IGS.  However
      as I have already observed, none of the five e-mails  supplied  to  me
      appears to relate directly to any other. They  are  simply  a  collage
      arranged in reverse date order. The only two  e-mails  from  enquirers
      asking expressly about maintenance are those dated  9  December  (page
      26) and 4 December (page 28). The reply from Mr Merryweather (page 27)
      upon which Ms Laughton places much reliance, is dated 8  December.  It
      cannot therefore be a reply to the enquiry of 9  December.  Nor  given
      the content and terminology used in the respective  e-mails  could  it
      relate to the enquiry of 4 December. The  e-mail  from  UKBA  dated  3
      December (page 28) is the response one would properly expect to a post
      31 October enquiry about maintenance. I have no reason to suppose that
      this would not be the  standard  response  to  people  making  similar
      enquiries. It is wholly unambiguous in its  statement  that  after  31
      October 2008 savings of at least �800 had to be  demonstrated  for  at
      least three months before applying i.e. the then normal arrangement.


  26.  There is therefore nothing in any of the documents I have been  shown
      to suggest that the transitional arrangement relating  to  maintenance
      was ever extended beyond 31 October 2008; or that there was any  basis
      in logic or fairness for doing s0; or that the UKBA gave  inconsistent
      or misleading answers to people who made specific enquiries about  the
      transitional arrangement for maintenance. In reaching this  conclusion
      I have taken into account that  those  making  an  unspecific  enquiry
      without mentioning maintenance about the IGS transitional  arrangement
      only will have received an automated response that  does  not  address
      maintenance at all. As I have said, the actual  method  specified  for
      evaluating maintenance is separate and distinct from the points  based
      system. I do not consider that in context there is material  ambiguity
      in the UKBA documentation. If anyone was in doubt there was  a  simple
      system for contacting the UKBA for clarification, as  the  e-mails  on
      page 28 of the Appellant's bundle dated 3 December 2008 demonstrates.

  27. On this basis I  now  consider  the  various  specific  issues  raised
      relating to this appeal.


   Lack of Respondent's Reply


  28. Ms Laughton has submitted that the  Respondent  failed  to  provide  a
      Reply  to  the  grounds  of  application  and  that   Ms   Isherwood's
      submissions were wider than merely considering the  existence  of  the
      policy. Therefore Ms Laughton maintains that the Respondent should  be
      prevented from asserting that there was no material error  of  law  by
      the Immigration Judge.  I disagree. Ms Laughton has cited the case  of
      MB (Rule 30 Procedure Rules) DRC [2008] UKAIT 00088. However this case
      provides  that  Rule  30  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration   Tribunal
      (Procedure) Rules 2005 should be read in conjunction with  Rule  31(4)
      (c). This has the effect that if there is a Reply I must take it  into
      account but if there is no Reply it is a matter which I may take  into
      account in the light of all facts in the case.


  29. I have applied this  guidance.  There  was  indeed  no  Reply  by  the
      Respondent. However, Ms Isherwood's submissions  with  regard  to  the
      Respondent's policy, which includes the transitional arrangement as to
      maintenance, are in effect that the Immigration Judge got it right and
      she did not err materially in law.  There  is  nothing  surprising  in
      that. Ms  Isherwood  also  supplied  information  in  support  of  her
      submissions, which I have found useful in  understanding  the  overall
      context against which this appeal must be  decided.   Thus,  whilst  I
      have taken into account the fact that there is no  Reply,  I  consider
      that the interests of justice require me  to  take  into  account  all
      facts and submissions provided to me in this case. I should  add  that
      Ms Isherwood has conceded that the Judge's analysis of  article  8  is
      inadequate but presumably Ms Laughton does not object to that. I shall
      come back to this issue later.


   Maintenance Requirement under the Rules and the Respondent's Policy

  30. I have already described the context and extent  of  the  transitional
      arrangement relating to maintenance. I have recorded the agreement  of
      both Representatives that were the Appellant eligible to  fall  within
      its scope, she would be entitled to succeed in her appeal, because the
      closing balance in  her  last  bank  statement  prior  to  making  her
      application (dated  13  November  2008)  was  �994.45.   However,  the
      unfortunate  reality  is  that  the  Appellant  did  not  submit   her
      application until after 31 October 2008. By the time  she  did  submit
      it, on 27 November 2008, the transitional arrangement  on  maintenance
      was no longer open to her, for the reasons I  have  already  described
      above.  She therefore had to satisfy what was  then  and  is  now  the
      normal rule, which requires a minimum bank balance of �800  for  three
      months ending in the month prior to the application.


  31. Ms Laughton has submitted in her  skeleton  argument  that  the  Judge
      failed to  have  regard  to  the  bank  statements  submitted  by  the
      Appellant. However this does not avail the Appellant.  I  have  looked
      at all the  bank  statements  referred  to  by  Ms  Laughton  and  the
      Appellant has not maintained for the  whole  period  of  three  months
      ending in the month of her application a minimum balance of �800.

  32. Thus I conclude that, even if there were  any  error  of  law  by  the
      Immigration Judge it is not material because the Appellant was  unable
      to satisfy the maintenance requirement due to the fact that at various
      times within the relevant three month period the balance on  her  bank
      account fell below �800. Thus, notwithstanding Ms  Laughton's  various
      submissions to the contrary, I conclude  that  there  is  no  material
      error of law in the Judge's dismissal of the Appellant's appeal  under
      the Immigration Rules.

   Legitimate Expectation

  33. Ms Laughton then offered the alternative submission that even  if  the
      Appellant  did  not  come  within  the  terms  of   the   transitional
      arrangement relating to maintenance, she had a legitimate  expectation
      that she would as a consequence of the  information  supplied  by  the
      Respondent.  She has cited various cases in support of her submission,
      which I have taken into account.  I accept  her  submission  that  the
      Tribunal has the jurisdiction to challenge an immigration decision  on
      the basis of the public law concept of a legitimate expectation, which
      falls within the ground of appeal that the  Respondent's  decision  is
      "otherwise not in accordance with the law".


  34. Of particular clarity and brevity as to the approach to be adopted  in
      assessing this concept is the guidance offered by Schiemann LJ in R  v
      Newham Borough Council  ex parte Bibi [2003] 1 WLR 237 where he states
      as follows.

           "In all legitimate expectation cases, whether the substantive or
           procedural, three practical questions arise.  The first question
           is to what has the public  authority,  whether  by  practice  or
           promise, committed itself; the second is whether  the  authority
           has acted or proposes to  act  unlawfully  in  relation  to  its
           commitment; the third is what the court should do."

  35. Applying these principles I conclude, for  the  reasons  given  above,
      first that the Respondent has, neither by practice nor  promise,  ever
      committed himself to extending the transitional  arrangement  relating
      to maintenance beyond 31 October 2008.  I have not  found  within  the
      documents supplied to  me  any  evidence  that  he  has  expressly  or
      impliedly given a contrary impression. I have  no  reason  to  suppose
      that the reply given by Ms Bennett of UKBA in her e-mail of 3 December
      2008 was not the standard response given by UKBA to  anyone  inquiring
      about  the  transitional  arrangement  on  maintenance.   It   follows
      therefore that I also conclude  that  the  Respondent  has  not  acted
      unlawfully in relation to his commitments on the subject.  Thus  there
      is no basis for the Tribunal to intervene on the basis  of  legitimate
      expectation, again notwithstanding the contrary submissions made by Ms
      Laughton.

   Article 8

  36. The final issue relates to Article 8. Ms Laughton has  submitted  that
      the Immigration Judge's assessment was inadequate to the  extent  that
      it represented a material error of law and should be set  aside.   The
      Judge dealt with this in one  paragraph  only  and  in  the  following
      terms.


           "7. So far as Article 8 is concerned, I accept that  during  the
           Appellant's time in the  United  Kingdom  she  has  developed  a
           private life in the UK, but there was no evidence before me that
           she had any family life here.  However, I am not satisfied  that
           the decision for the Appellant to leave the United Kingdom would
           be disproportionate on the evidence that is currently before  me
           as she cannot come within the terms of the Immigration Rules."


  37. Ms Isherwood agreed that this was an inadequate and mistaken  approach
      that cannot be sustained.  I  agree  also.  The  mere  fact  that  the
      application cannot come within the terms of the Immigration  Rules  is
      not  in  itself  a  basis  for  concluding  that  removal   would   be
      proportionate under Article 8.  However there is no dispute concerning
      the evidence relating to the Appellant's private and  family  life  in
      the UK and  I  am  therefore  able  to  reach  my  own  conclusion  in
      substitution for that of the Judge.


  38. Ms Laughton submitted in her skeleton argument that the Appellant  had
      established a private life in the UK, though not any family life.   It
      was a strong private life which can be  summarised  in  the  following
      terms.  The Appellant arrived in the UK  in  September  2003  and  has
      lived  here  for  nearly  6  years,  always  in  accordance  with  the
      requirements of immigration law. She has obtained a Bachelor  of  Arts
      degree in Fashion Photography.  Since  her  graduation  she  has  been
      working as a  professional  photographer  for  various  magazines  and
      companies.  She has built up excellent  contacts  within  the  fashion
      industry in the UK. She is now involved as a co-founder and production
      manager in the launch of her new magazine, which will create jobs  for
      24 people in the UK. She is an essential part of the venture.

  39. Ms Laughton submitted further that the removal of the Appellant  would
      constitute  interference  with  her  private  life  and   would   have
      consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage Article 8, where
      the test for engagement  is  not  a  particularly  high  one.   Whilst
      removal would be for a legitimate aim and in accordance with the  law,
      it would not be proportionate. The interference is not necessary.  The
      reason the Appellant was  refused  under  the  Immigration  Rules  was
      because she had not maintained a constant �800 in her account for  the
      three months prior to her application.  The cause of this was that the
      Appellant genuinely believed she did not need to do so as she would be
      applying under the transitional arrangement.  This  belief  was  based
      upon a  genuine  misunderstanding.  If  she  had  been  aware  of  the
      necessity to maintain the minimum balance of �800 she could have  done
      so.  She will not be reliant  upon  public  funds  or  face  financial
      hardship.  She has always been able  to  maintain  herself  and  could
      continue to do so as well as employing a number of others.  If removed
      she would not be eligible to reapply under the scheme  because  it  is
      now more than 12 months since she passed her degree. This  means  that
      she would be unable to return to the UK and the contacts she has built
      up in the fashion industry would be  lost  and  the  magazine  she  is
      establishing would have to be abandoned with  the  loss  of  jobs  for
      others.


  40. Ms Isherwood on the other hand has argued that this  is  a  case  that
      would be bound to be  dismissed  under  Article  8.   The  Appellant's
      private life was established in the UK when her immigration status was
      that of a person expected to leave at the end  of  her  stay.  It  was
      difficult to see in those circumstances that  legitimate  interference
      with her private life could have consequences of such  gravity  as  to
      engage Article 8, and in the alternative, if it did, removal would  be
      proportionate. There was a strong policy imperative in  the  interests
      of consistency and fairness in the move to  objectivity  in  assessing
      immigration claims. It should not be  eroded.  If  the  Appellant  had
      believed that she was entitled to  the  benefit  of  the  transitional
      arrangement on maintenance after 31 October 2008 she was mistaken  and
      should not benefit from her own mistake. She had had plenty of time to
      organise her affairs to meet the new requirement.

  41. Having carefully considered these  submissions  I  have  concluded  as
      follows. I accept that in the six years the Appellant has been in  the
      UK, she has always been within the law and has never been a burden  on
      the state. She has established a private life in the UK, both in terms
      of pursuing  her  education  to  graduate  level  and  in  laying  the
      foundations for a future career. She is currently an integral part  of
      a new fashion magazine, which reflects the contacts she has  made  and
      her own personal skills.   She  anticipates  that  the  magazine  will
      employ 24 people. She says all this will be lost if she is removed.  I
      do not accept  this  latter  point.  If  a  business  is  viable,  few
      individuals are truly indispensable. Moreover, the Appellant's  skills
      and qualifications are portable and can found a career for her in  her
      home country in South Korea, which has a powerful and growing economy.



  42. I accept that the Appellant may have  made  a  genuine  mistake  about
      whether  she  would  qualify  for  the  transitional  arrangement   on
      maintenance, probably because she did not properly address her mind to
      the  issue  or  make   proper   enquiries.   That   however   is   her
      responsibility.

  43. I have concluded for the reasons stated above that the Respondent  did
      not do anything that could give rise  to  any  legitimate  expectation
      that she would so qualify. I accept that  there  is  a  strong  policy
      element for  the  Respondent  in  the  interests  of  consistency  and
      fairness in  making  a  clean  break,  subject  to  fair  transitional
      arrangements, from the  old  system  of  subjective  and  inconsistent
      evaluation of maintenance. Indeed the past delays in  decision  making
      and the large body of jurisprudence that  has  built  up  around  this
      subject in recent years demonstrates the pitfalls of  subjectivity  in
      assessing claims. The reality is that wherever the  dividing  line  is
      drawn some people will fall on the wrong side of it. It  may  be  that
      the Appellant could have organised her affairs to meet the normal �800
      for three months requirement but it is due to her error that  she  did
      not do so.


  44. On the basis of this analysis, I have concluded for  the  purposes  of
      the step by step  approach  to  Article  8,  that  the  Appellant  has
      established a private  life  in  the  UK  and  that  the  Respondent's
      decision would result in  interference  with  it.   That  interference
      would  have  consequences  of  such  gravity  for  the  Appellant   as
      potentially to engage Article 8.   However  removal  would  be  for  a
      legitimate aim and would be in accordance with the  law.  That  leaves
      the question of proportionality.

  45. In Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL  11  the  House  of  Lords  clarified  the
      approach to be adopted when assessing proportionality in the following
      terms.
           19.  In  de  Freitas  v  Permanent  Secretary  of  Ministry   of
           Agriculture, Fisheries, Lands and Housing [1999] 1  AC  69,  80,
           the Privy  Council,  drawing  on  South  African,  Canadian  and
           Zimbabwean authority, defined  the  questions  generally  to  be
           asked in deciding whether a measure is proportionate:
                    "whether: (i) the legislative objective is  sufficiently
                    important to justify limiting a fundamental right;  (ii)
                    the measures designed to meet the legislative  objective
                    are rationally connected to it; and (iii) the means used
                    to impair the right or  freedom  are  no  more  than  is
                    necessary to accomplish the objective."
           This formulation has been widely cited and applied.  But  counsel
           for the applicants (with the support of Liberty,  in  a  valuable
           written  intervention)  suggested  that   the   formulation   was
           deficient in omitting  reference  to  an  overriding  requirement
           which featured in the judgment of Dickson CJ in R v Oakes  [1986]
           1 SCR 103, from which this approach to  proportionality  derives.
           This feature is (p 139) the need  to  balance  the  interests  of
           society with those of individuals and groups. This is  indeed  an
           aspect which should never be overlooked or discounted. The  House
           recognised as much in R (Razgar) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
           Home Department [2004] UKHL 27, [2004] 2 AC 368, paras 17-20, 26,
           27, 60, 77, when, having suggested a series of questions which an
           adjudicator would have to ask and answer in deciding a Convention
           question, it said that the judgment on proportionality
                "must always involve the striking of a fair balance between
                the rights of the  individual  and  the  interests  of  the
                community which is inherent in the whole of the Convention.
                The severity and consequences of the interference will call
                for careful assessment at this stage" (see para 20).
           If, as counsel suggest, insufficient attention has been paid  to
           this requirement, the failure should be made good.
           20. In an Article 8 case where this  question  is  reached,  the
           ultimate question for the  appellate  immigration  authority  is
           whether  the  refusal  of  leave  to   enter   or   remain,   in
           circumstances where the life of the family cannot reasonably  be
           expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking  full  account  of  all
           considerations weighing in favour of the refusal, prejudices the
           family life of the applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to
           amount to a breach of the fundamental right protected by Article
           8. If the answer to this question is affirmative, the refusal is
           unlawful and the authority must so decide. It is  not  necessary
           that the appellate immigration authority, directing itself along
           the lines indicated  in  this  opinion,  need  ask  in  addition
           whether the case meets a test of exceptionality. The  suggestion
           that it should is based on an observation  of  Lord  Bingham  in
           Razgar above, para 20. He was there expressing  an  expectation,
           shared with the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, that the number  of
           claimants not covered by the Rules and supplementary  directions
           but entitled to succeed under Article 8 would be  a  very  small
           minority.  That  is  still  his  expectation.  But  he  was  not
           purporting to lay down a legal test.
  46. This approach is expressed in terms of family life but applies also to
      private life.  I have to balance the interests of society  with  those
      of this particular individual and  those  with  whom  she  enjoys  her
      private life, on the specific  facts  of  this  case.   Obviously  the
      interests of society are to  maintain  a  firm  and  fair  immigration
      system expressed in terms of the Immigration Rules  and  the  policies
      relating thereto as I have described above. I must  and  do  give  due
      deference to this. However, I am also conscious that the Appellant may
      have been able to satisfy those Rules and policies but for  a  genuine
      misunderstanding on her part.


  47. This Appellant is a person whose private life has  for  6  years  been
      structured in terms of education, contacts and business  opportunities
      from being legally in the UK. Thus far she has been  in  the  UK  only
      with limited leave. She stands to  lose  the  fruits  of  her  present
      contacts and business opportunities if removed, even though of  course
      she would take her skills with her and will have  the  opportunity  to
      build a new career in her own country.   The  Appellant  would  in  my
      assessment be an asset in whatever society she settled.

  48. I have decided on balance and on the particular  facts  of  this  case
      that it would not be disproportionate for the Appellant to be removed.
       Therefore, I dismiss her appeal on all grounds.


                                  DECISION

      The Immigration Judge made no material error of law in dismissing  the
      Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules and on the  basis  that
      the Respondent had acted in accordance  with  the  law.   However  the
      Judge did materially err in law in her assessment of  the  Appellant's
      Article  8  appeal,  and  the  following   decision   is   accordingly
      substituted:


           "The Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision is
           dismissed under Article 8."

                            FUNDING DETERMINATION

The Tribunal is satisfied that, at the time the Appellant made  the  section
103A application and for the reasons indicated  in  the  Senior  Immigration
Judge's order for reconsideration, there was  a  significant  prospect  that
the appeal would  be  allowed  upon  reconsideration.  It  orders  that  the
Appellant's costs in respect of the  application  for  reconsideration,  the
preparation for reconsideration and the reconsideration are to be  paid  out
of the relevant fund, as defined in Rule 33 of the  Asylum  and  Immigration
Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005
