                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 14th October 1974 is a citizen of Sri Lanka.  The
    Appellant was present and represented by Mr McVea.  The Respondent  was
    represented by Mr McVeety a Home Office Presenting Officer.



Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom on 8th January 2011  on
    a visit visa and made application for asylum on 29th August 2012.   The
    Respondent had refused that application on  10th  November  2013.   The
    Appellant had appealed the decision and her appeal was heard by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Frankish on 26th March 2014 and he had allowed the
    appeal.  The Respondent had made application for permission  to  appeal
    and that was granted on 19th May 2014.

 3. The matter came before me to decide whether or not an error of law  had
    been made on 11th September 2014.  I found errors of law had been  made
    in the reasons  provided  in  the  determination  promulgated  on  25th
    September 2014.  Directions were issued for the remaking of  this  case
    before myself in the Upper Tribunal.  The matter  comes  before  me  in
    accordance with those directions.

The Proceedings - Introduction

 4. As the Appellant was present I firstly explained to her the  nature  of
    the proceedings and the way that they would be  conducted.   I  firstly
    checked the documents available to me in this case.

 5. The Respondent's documents consist of:

      i) Immigration history.

     ii) Those documents listed at folios A to G on the index sheet.

    iii) Refusal letter.

     iv) Removal directions.

      v) Notice and Grounds of Appeal.

 6. The Appellant's documents consist of:

     vi) Those documents listed at folios RFT-1 to page  191  on  the  index
         sheet to the bundle.

 7. Mr McVea raised a preliminary issue that being a  request  for  an  all
    female court.  He made reference to the Appellant's  concern  that  the
    male interviewer at  the  asylum  interview  stage  had  been  somewhat
    aggressive and that may have affected her ability to provide  evidence.



 8. I refused the application. Firstly I had noted that the hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal had been conducted before a male judge and with
    a male Presenting Officer and  there  were  no  references  within  the
    determination to any difficulties  or  problems  arising  out  of  male
    individuals at the hearing.  At the error of law  stage  I  also  noted
    that myself had been the judge and the Appellant had  been  represented
    by Dr Mynott also a male.

 9. Thirdly it was apparent that the Appellant had  been  able  to  provide
    instructions  and  be  represented  on  previous  occasions   by   male
    representatives.   Fourthly  I  referred  Mr  McVea  to  the   Tribunal
    Procedure Rules and the need  to  deal  with  matters  in  a  fair  and
    effective manner without incurring unnecessary costs or delays.

10. Finally I indicated that given the  potential  central  matters  to  be
    considered it did not necessarily appear to  be  the  case  that  there
    would be extensive cross-examination of the Appellant and in particular
    in respect of the alleged sexual abuse which was perhaps at  the  heart
    of the concern and application.  Mr McVea accepted my decision and  for
    the record there was no stage during the proceedings  when  I  had  any
    concern that the Appellant was unable to deal with questions or provide
    answers to those matters put to her.

11. In order to identify the central issues in this case in part to  remove
    the need for unnecessary questioning I had a brief discussion with both
    representatives.   Following  those  discussions  I  outlined  to   the
    representatives those issues that had been raised as follows:

      i) Credibility of the Appellant's account in particular:

          a) Is she Tamil?

          b) Was she detained as claimed?

     ii) Is it is likely that she is on a stop list and therefore at risk at
         the airport if returned to Sri Lanka?

    iii) Can she relocate safely to her husband's home area?

     iv) Is there an overriding risk from religious extremists  towards  the
         Appellant being a convert from Muslim to Hindu?

      v) Does her current medical condition mean that she has a claim  under
         Article 8 of the ECHR with reference to Section 55 of  the  Borders
         Act 2009 in respect of her young child?

Evidence

12. The Appellant was called to give evidence and provided her  full  name.
    She confirmed her witness statement dated 15th March 2014 was true  and
    accurate and adopted that as her examination-in-chief.  That  statement
    appears at pages 1 to 6 on the bundle before the First-tier Tribunal.

13. In cross-examination  she  said  that  she  recalled  the  Home  Office
    interview and the question of ethnicity and said that she was a  Muslim
    at question 15 and confirmed that she had told  them  that  she  was  a
    Tamil Muslim.  Although  she  had  given  a  different  answer  in  the
    interview record she was adamant that she had said that she was a Tamil
    Muslim and said that she spoke Tamil and that she was now a Hindu.

14. She said that the came to know through  her  friend,  Jothi,  what  was
    happening in respect of the Tamils after she played a  video  for  her.
    She had not any first hand experience of what was  happening  with  the
    Tamil population in Sri Lanka.  Her family did not fight or support the
    LTTE.  She said that her father was diabetic  and  was  unemployed  and
    that her uncle looked after her parents and herself as an  only  child.
    Her uncle ran a clothing business and  used  to  travel  frequently  to
    India.  She said that he knew many people.

15. The area in which she had been born contained  Sinhalese,  Muslims  and
    Tamils.  She had moved to Colombo in 2005 when she was about  31  years
    of age.  She said that she had been arrested by the police at  the  end
    of 2009.

16. She had collected parcels on behalf of her friend.  She did not open or
    see the contents of those parcels but on one or two occasions  she  had
    been shown and was aware that they contained  passports  on  occasions.
    She said she had also purchased mobile phone sim cards in  Colombo  and
    had been taking part in those activities until arrested.

17. She met her husband in the UK in 2012, she thought it was the beginning
    of the year.  She had come to the UK in 2010 with Kuwait employers.

18. Her employer had gone back to Kuwait and he had called her to accompany
    him.  The Appellant said that she had problems in Sri Lanka and if  her
    employer was able to keep her in Kuwait with him then she would go.  He
    said that he would at least initially have to  send  her  back  to  Sri
    Lanka and as a result she asked for her passport which he gave to  her.
    She then left the house and went outside.   She  said  that  she  found
    someone who looked a Tamil and spoke to him and he is the person who is
    now her husband.  She said her purpose for going out had been to buy  a
    phone card so she was able to speak to her parents.

19. She said she spoke to her parents once monthly and  had  thus  far  not
    told them that either she was married or had a child.

20. Her uncle had sent her to Kuwait to work for an employer in March  2010
    and she had been in Kuwait  between  March  and  November  2010  before
    coming to the UK with the Kuwaiti family.  She  said  that  family  had
    never beaten her and they were kind to her.

21. She had moved to Colombo to work and had gone with her  uncle  who  had
    left her there and she had worked as a domestic assistant for a  family
    in Colombo who were Saudi Arabians and connected to the Saudi  Embassy.
    Although she worked in their private home she had her own accommodation
    and thereafter Jothi had joined her in that accommodation.

22. In re-examination she was referred to two birth certificates.  She said
    that she had purchased sim cards  for  Jothi  and  had  worn  what  she
    described as a Muslim outfit when going to  get  the  cards  describing
    this as simply a head veil.

23. I next heard from the Appellant's husband, Mr Selvarajah.  He  provided
    his full name and confirmed  that  his  witness  statement  dated  15th
    January 2014 appearing at pages 7 to 10 on the Appellant's  bundle  was
    true and correct and adopted it as his examination-in-chief.

24. In cross-examination he confirmed that he had met his wife in London at
    a shop and that she had asked him if he  was  Tamil  to  which  he  had
    replied that he was.  He confirmed he was Tamil and said  that  he  had
    met her in July 2012.  He said his parents lived in India  now  and  he
    spoke to them occasionally.

25. I then heard submissions on behalf of the Respondent.  I  was  referred
    to various  matters  concerning  the  credibility  of  the  Appellant's
    account.  It was submitted that the Respondent's case was that  due  to
    the lack of credibility in the Appellant's account it was not  accepted
    that she had been detained and therefore by logical flow  not  accepted
    that she had been abused physically or sexually  as  described.   There
    were matters raised concerning what was said to be inadequacies  within
    the medical evidence that had been presented.  In respect of the report
    prepared by Dr Chris Smith in terms of Sri Lanka it was submitted  that
    many of the points that he made predated GJ and were dated.

26. I finally heard submissions on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  and  I  was
    referred helpfully to the skeleton  argument.   It  was  submitted  the
    Appellant had provided a consistent  and  true  account  and  I  should
    accept her credibility.  It was further noted that the Appellant had at
    the stage of the First-tier Tribunal accepted that she was not a Tamil.
     I was referred to the medical report and to the country  material  and
    the country guidance case  in  terms  of  those  at  risk  and  it  was
    submitted that the Appellant would be at risk on return.

27. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision to consider the
    documents and evidence submitted.  I now provide that decision with  my
    reasons.

The Law

Asylum

28. Paragraph 334 of the Immigration Rules states that the  applicant  will
    be granted asylum if the  provisions  of  that  paragraph  apply.   The
    burden of proof rests on an Appellant to  satisfy  me  that  she  falls
    within the definition of a refugee in Regulation 2 of  the  Refugee  or
    Person in Need of International Protection (Qualification)  Regulations
    2006.  In essence an Appellant will have to show there are  substantial
    grounds for believing that she is outside her country of nationality or
    if applicable her country of former habitual residence by reason  of  a
    well-founded fear of persecution for a Refugee Convention  reason,  and
    is unable or unwilling owing to such  fear  to  avail  herself  of  the
    protection of that country.

Humanitarian Protection

29. Paragraph 339C of the Immigration Rules states that  an  applicant  who
    does not qualify as a refugee will be granted  humanitarian  protection
    if the provisions of that paragraph apply.  The burden of  proof  rests
    on an Appellant to satisfy me that  she  is  entitled  to  humanitarian
    protection under paragraph 339 of the Immigration Rules.  In essence an
    Appellant will have to show there are substantial grounds for believing
    that if returned she would face a real risk of suffering  serious  harm
    and she is unable or owing to such risk unwilling to avail  herself  of
    the protection of the country of return.

The ECHR

30. The burden of proof rests on an  Appellant  to  satisfy  me  there  are
    substantial grounds for believing that as a result of the  Respondent's
    decision she will be exposed to a real risk of torture  or  inhuman  or
    degrading treatment or punishment contrary to Article 3.

Decision and Reasons

31. The Appellant's claim was essentially based upon two fears if  returned
    to Sri Lanka.  Firstly she had initially claimed to be a Tamil and  had
    endured arrest, detention and torture at the hands of  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities as an LTTE supporter based upon activities she  claimed  to
    have undertaken on behalf of her flatmate and friend Jothi, who  was  a
    member of the LTTE.  Secondly the Appellant was originally a Muslim but
    had converted to Hindu upon marriage to her husband in the UK,  himself
    a Hindu and a failed asylum seeker.  She feared  retribution  from  her
    family and Muslims as a result of her conversion and "mixed"  marriage.



32. The Appellant's original claim to be Tamil,  was  consistent  with  her
    speaking Tamil.  It would also have provided some credible support  for
    her claim to be enlisted by Jothi an LTTE member or supporter  and  the
    subsequent adverse interest in her by the Sri Lankan authorities.

33. In closing submissions Mr McVeety referred to a  number  of  evidential
    features to demonstrate  her  claim  to  be  Tamil  was  not  credible.
    Although overlooked at the time, it was accepted by  Mr  McVea  in  his
    closing submissions, that the Appellant  had  on  an  earlier  occasion
    conceded that she was not Tamil.  It is recorded at paragraph 9 of  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  determination  that  a  hearing  on  9th
    December 2013 the Appellant  had  conceded  that  she  was  not  Tamil.
    Accordingly whilst it is accepted and clear the Appellant speaks Tamil,
    having been brought up in a mixed language/ethnic area  of  Sri  Lanka,
    she has never herself been a Tamil.  The concession  deals  effectively
    with that issue.  It does raise concerns however as to her  credibility
    generally, given her claim for asylum in August 2012 was fifteen months
    prior to her concession on this point.  It also raises the need to look
    carefully at the Appellant's account  of  her  alleged  activities  and
    difficulties immediately before leaving Sri Lanka as her lack of  Tamil
    ethnicity may have some significance upon that account.

34. By way of background the Appellant's oral evidence disclosed  that  she
    was an only child.  Her father did not work as he was diabetic nor  did
    her mother.  They were essentially looked after by her  maternal  uncle
    who ran a clothing business, and travelled  reasonably  extensively  on
    business between Sri Lanka and India.  She confirmed that none  of  her
    family had been involved with the LTTE at any stage or  at  any  level.
    Indeed she was wholly unaware of any LTTE activities  or  the  conflict
    between that group and the authorities.  As observed by Mr McVeety that
    seems somewhat implausible  for  a  Tamil,  but  far  less  implausible
    perhaps for a non-Tamil from a family that had no political involvement
    or possible interest and whose  sole  focus  may  have  been  financial
    survival.

35. The Appellant had left home in about 2003/2004 to work in Colombo.  She
    was employed as a housekeeper in a private residence but rented her own
    room in  shared  accommodation  elsewhere.   It  would  seem  a  proper
    inference from the Appellant's evidence that her employment in  Colombo
    was arranged perhaps by her uncle.  It is also an  inference  that  the
    Appellant and her family were at least content that she could  lead  an
    independent life in Colombo as a single Muslim lady  aged  about  28/29
    years  of  age.   There  is  no  suggestion  that  she   suffered   any
    difficulties or adversity because of those features whilst in  Colombo.



36. It is also noteworthy that although the  Appellant  had  indicated  she
    left Sri Lanka for the first time in March 2010 (question 104/105), she
    had in fact left Sri Lanka in 1998 on a previously issued passport  and
    had gone to Kuwait.  Her time and circumstances in Kuwait at that  time
    were not explored but it does show that on that  earlier  occasion  the
    Appellant had been independent enough  to  have  left  home,  travelled
    abroad and then returned because she claimed  "she  did  not  like  it"
    (question 177).

37. Her account of events leading to her alleged arrest  and  ill-treatment
    stem from her assertion that in 2005 she met a  friend  of  her  cousin
    called Jothi who needed accommodation in Colombo and it was agreed that
    she would share with the Appellant.  The Appellant's  account  is  that
    Jothi turned out to be working for the LTTE and in  due  time  enlisted
    the Appellant to collect parcels at a bus station  from  another.   She
    also gave the Appellant cash so the  Appellant  could  buy  significant
    numbers  of  mobile  sim  cards  and  credit  top-ups.   The  Appellant
    described those activities increasing significantly in 2009.

38. There are some matters of credibility arising from this aspect  of  the
    Appellant's claim.  Firstly would an LTTE member/activist such as Jothi
    trust a non-Tamil, non-political individual with such work that was  so
    easily traceable directly back to Jothi herself?  It is also a  feature
    that Jothi and the Appellant did not  even  share  the  same  religion,
    Jothi being Hindu and the Appellant Muslim.  Secondly if Jothi  as  the
    account suggests was an operating member of the LTTE working wholly  or
    in  part  out  of  Colombo  would  she  need  to  rely  upon  a  casual
    acquaintance in 2005 for accommodation?  Thirdly if the  Appellant  was
    working  full-time  as  a  domestic  worker  would  her  employers   be
    sufficiently relaxed about her working hours  to  allow  her  time  off
    during the day, often presumably at short notice, to make trips to  the
    bus station or shops.  Finally, although  the  Appellant  in  interview
    made reference to collecting parcels whose contents were unknown to her
    she made no reference to purchasing sim cards and phone  top-ups  which
    appeared only in her witness statement of 15th March 2014.

39. In respect of her ill-treatment following arrest the  Appellant  relies
    upon a medical report prepared by Dr  Davidson.   This  is  dated  20th
    March 2014.  There appears to be either an error or  misinformation  at
    paragraph 41 of that report which indicates that she  and  her  husband
    were drawn to each other as they were both Tamils.   The  Appellant  is
    not Tamil.  There was also reference by her to the doctor at  paragraph
    43 that she found it difficult to engage  in  a  physical  relationship
    with her husband at first because  of  her  experiences.   However  the
    evidence discloses that she met her husband in July 2012 and by  August
    2012 she had already suffered a miscarriage.  That does not  suggest  a
    difficulty in forming a physical relationship  (understandable  if  she
    had been gang raped).  However the  doctor  does  not  deal  with  that
    discrepancy although he  refers  to  the  miscarriage  in  August  2012
    himself at paragraph 54.

40. The Appellant's main physical condition or complaint was  pain  in  her
    neck and right shoulder with potential reduced  movement.   The  doctor
    noted she attributed that  to  her  ill-treatment  in  detention.   The
    doctor does not appear to note whether she is right or left handed.  He
    does note at paragraph 80 that on 9th  October  2013  when  seen  by  a
    physiotherapist she had full movement.  He noted that shoulder pain  is
    a common condition in the general population and could be caused  by  a
    range of matters including repetitive movements and heavy lifting.   He
    accepts the latter to being potentially experienced by someone who  has
    been engaged as a housemaid.  He noted they also arise from  those  who
    have survived torture such as repeated beatings or positional  torture.



41. The only scar or mark found on the Appellant  was  curve  mark  on  her
    right lower back.  The Appellant was unsure how long she  had  had  the
    mark and whilst thought it may have arisen from kicks  or  punches  was
    uncertain (paragraph 63).  However the doctor  states  this  is  highly
    consistent with her attribution of trauma from kicks/punches (paragraph
    111).  That does not  appear  to  accurately  reflect  the  Appellant's
    uncertain position as noted earlier.   The  doctor  further  states  at
    paragraph 110 that the findings on her rights shoulder  are  consistent
    with her account.  However he does not seem to resolve the fact that as
    well as being a common general complaint they are also consistent  with
    the type of repetitive manual labour she may have been doing  for  some
    years.  Indeed the evidence does disclose that she had been employed in
    such domestic labour for many years.

42. I have also noted some not insignificant  differences  in  the  account
    given by the Appellant of her detention to the doctor in March 2014 and
    her own  witness  statement  in  January  2014.   In  her  own  witness
    statement she claimed that after her confession she  was  detained  for
    one month in a cell and during that time she was repeatedly beaten  and
    tortured.  She further claimed that a soldier who regularly served  her
    food was the person that she spoke to, to get in touch with her  uncle.
    However in her account to the doctor she  claimed  that  following  her
    confession she was placed in the cell for one month but was never again
    abused physically or sexually (paragraph 22 doctor's report).  She also
    made no reference to  a  soldier  serving  her  food  but  instead  had
    referred to seeing a Sinhalese uniformed man  once,  immediately  after
    being released from the room where she was raped and it was he who said
    she could be released by payment  of  a  bribe  and  she  provided  her
    uncle's address.  Those inconsistencies  are  in  my  view  significant
    features.  They occur at times when the Appellant has had  many  months
    to consider her case and in non-confrontational conversations with  her
    own solicitor and a  doctor  preparing  a  report  on  her  behalf  and
    instructed for that purpose.

43. I have noted the medical evidence regarding psychological  matters.   I
    am bound to observe that her uncertain position in the UK, the fact her
    husband is a failed  asylum  seeker,  the  prior  miscarriage  and  the
    current caring for a young baby are factors in  themselves  that  could
    create depression, anxiety and other symptoms associated with PTSD.   I
    have in this respect noted the doctor's comments on these  features  at
    paragraphs 112 to 113 and taken those into account.

44. I find the medical report whilst helpful seems to rather swiftly  reach
    a conclusion upon the shoulder pain and single mark whilst not  dealing
    with any sufficiency as to other potential causes.  It is a report that
    inevitably only forms part of the  overall  evidence  that  I  need  to
    consider when assessing credibility.

45. I have also considered the submission made by Mr McVeety as to  why  in
    2009 Jothi or the Appellant would be operating given the defeat of  the
    LTTE and the end of the war.  I find it difficult to presume the end of
    the war would necessarily bring to an end all activity and I have  also
    noted the country report from Dr Chris Smith.

46. The Appellant has been in regular contact with her family since arrival
    in the UK.  There is no evidence that her parents or uncle have at  any
    stage been detained or questioned regarding her position.  There is  no
    reference by the Appellant of her cousin experiencing  any  questioning
    or problems due to her alleged friendship with  Jothi.   Again  I  have
    referred to Dr Smith's report,  suggesting  as  it  does  a  reasonably
    comprehensive intelligence service in Sri Lanka and a  ruthlessness  in
    dealing with LTTE supporters.

47. There has been no arrest warrant, summons or any other document to show
    any adverse interest in the Appellant from the Sri Lankan  authorities.
    There is nothing to suggest that she is regarded as someone who escaped
    from detention or is still wanted.  The regular contact with her family
    indicates that such document or news would be capable of  being  passed
    to her in the UK if it existed.

48. Finally there is the mechanism of her alleged escape.  Whilst I  accept
    that bribery does exist and it is theoretically possible that she would
    escape through bribery it would seem perhaps a little unlikely that  an
    LTTE supporter would be able to leave by payment of a  bribe.   However
    leaving that factor to one side the Appellant's evidence is that on her
    release in January 2010 with the  assistance  of  her  uncle.   It  was
    incumbent upon her to leave Sri Lanka as swiftly  as  possible.   Given
    her uncle's clear connections with India  and  the  proximity  of  that
    country and his frequency of movement between the two countries it  may
    be thought that would be the likely means of escape even if  that  were
    only to be a temporary measure to secure her immediate safety.

49. However the Appellant's Visa Application Form would  suggest  a  rather
    different set of circumstances.  Firstly  it  discloses  that  she  was
    issued with a Sri Lankan passport in August 2009.  On  the  Appellant's
    evidence this was at the height of her clandestine work for  Jothi  but
    prior to her arrest in December 2009.  It  begs  the  question  why  in
    August 2009 did the Appellant  apply  for  a  passport  while  she  was
    happily working in Colombo, had not been arrested or detained  and  was
    allegedly carrying out clandestine work.  She further  claims  that  in
    January 2010 on her release or shortly thereafter  her  uncle  arranged
    for her to work in Kuwait for a different family that  brought  her  to
    the UK in November 2010.  Her visa application shows that prior to  her
    application in September 2010 to come to the UK.  She had been  working
    as a domestic worker for a diplomatic household in Kuwait sponsored  by
    the Kuwait Embassy in London.  Further  her  application  in  September
    2010 was to accompany the Kuwait Military Attach�'s family  to  the  UK
    again sponsored by the Kuwait Embassy in London.

50. I finding it lacking in credibility that when arrested and detained  in
    her own flat her passport issued only a  few  months  earlier  was  not
    confiscated.  I find no explanation as to how or  why  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities would have overlooked this crucial item of  identification.
    I further find no explanation why she had applied for her passport when
    she did in the first instance.  I do not  find  it  credible  that  her
    uncle would be able to secure her departure from  Sri  Lanka  in  early
    2010 by obtaining employment for her by  Kuwaiti  diplomatic  officials
    and that her visa was essentially sponsored by the  Kuwait  Embassy  in
    London nor, that by coincidence the same embassy sponsored her visa  in
    September 2010.

51. In summary I find a lack of credibility in the Appellant's account when
    examining all the evidence in the round.  I find the Appellant is not a
    Tamil but a Muslim woman.  She may well have come from  a  family  with
    modest means due in part or in whole to her father's illness.  She  had
    in the past in 1998 obtained a passport and gone to seek employment  in
    Kuwait.  The length of her stay in Kuwait or elsewhere then, is unknown
    as she claims to have lost that passport so records cannot be  checked.
    She may well have gone to work as a domestic worker  for  a  diplomatic
    family in Colombo in 2004.  She again applied for and obtained a second
    passport in August 2009 prior to any arrest or detention.  She was able
    to retain that passport and on 24th March 2010 left Sri Lanka  without
    let or hindrance, on her own passport to go to Kuwait for which she had
    already been issued with a visa (C3  Respondent's  bundle).   She  then
    came to the UK from  Kuwait  as  a  domestic  worker  with  the  Kuwait
    Military Attach�.  That visa  was  valid  until  September  2012.   She
    claimed asylum on 29th August  2012  very  shortly  before  that  visa
    expired.  I find no credibility in respect of her claim for asylum.   I
    find that she has been a domestic  worker  essentially  for  diplomatic
    households for several years if not longer and merely used her presence
    in the UK as an opportunity to claim asylum on a false basis.

52. I find that she is not a Tamil.  I find that she has never  worked  for
    or supported the LTTE.  I find that she has at no stage adversely  come
    to the attention of the authorities.  I find that she is not even known
    to the authorities in any adverse manner.  She has been able to  obtain
    a passport and leave Sri Lanka without any  difficulties  even  at  the
    claimed height of the adverse interest in her.  I  find  that  she  has
    worked for substantial periods of her life  as  a  domestic  worker  in
    diplomatic households and has for many years led a life independent  of
    her family earning her own way in life  through  employment.   She  has
    lived and worked independent of her  family  in  both  Colombo  and  in
    Kuwait and potentially elsewhere.

53. In view of my findings I have considered the country material  and  the
    country guidance case.  I find no shred  of  evidence  to  suggest  she
    would be on a "stop" or "watch" list that may  place  her  at  risk  on
    return at the airport  in  respect  of  the  former  or  under  general
    surveillance in respect of the latter.  She has no profile  that  would
    arise any general suspicion, i.e. she is neither a Tamil  nor  an  LTTE
    supporter.  In respect of return as a failed asylum seeker she would be
    returning on a valid passport.  She  had  left  Sri  Lanka  openly  and
    lawfully on that passport  with  visas  demonstrating  her  purpose  in
    leaving and for her work abroad.  She has undertaken no activity in the
    UK that would cause any concern.

54. I turn to the second aspect of her case namely her conversion to Hindu.
     The Appellant is 40 years of age, married and with  one  young  child.
    Her husband is a failed asylum seeker  himself.   His  account  was  in
    large measure found to be lacking in  credibility  by  a  judge  on  an
    earlier  occasion.   In  particular  the  judge  found  he   faced   no
    difficulties from  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities,  and  could  live  in
    Colombo.  He found the husband may have specific difficulty in his home
    village as he had given the name of an LTTE supporter to the Sri Lankan
    authorities.  However that was something that occurred in 2007/2008 now
    some several years ago.  Although the  Appellant  claims  to  fear  her
    family and other Muslims because of her conversion I find no reasonable
    risk in that respect.  The Sri Lankan Government is not run  by  Muslim
    extremists or otherwise and Muslims form only 7% of the population.   I
    find no reasonable likelihood she would suffer risk for her  conversion
    from the authorities.  I find no evidence that  her  family  consisting
    essentially of her father, mother and uncle pose  a  threat.   Her  own
    parents have been content to allow the Appellant to forge her own  life
    over many years.  Her  uncle  is  essentially  a  businessman  with  no
    evidence that he or other family  members  are  mindless  fanatics.   I
    accept of course that in Sri Lanka there may well be extremist  Muslims
    or indeed extremists from other  religions  who  may  theoretically  be
    outraged by anyone's conversion or lifestyle that did  not  echo  their
    own narrow interpretations.   However  there  is  no  evidence  of  any
    specific threat to the Appellant.  It is also a sad fact of  life  that
    such extremism can now be found in almost all societies  including  the
    UK.  Indeed it may be there are more extremists  in  the  UK  than  Sri
    Lanka.  It is simply not known.  However I find no reasonable risk from
    those theoretical individuals to the Appellant.

55. I have noted Dr Smith's report.  He  refers  to  difficulties  for  the
    Appellant on return in terms of registration, movement, employment etc.
    based essentially upon her lack of  a  national  identity  card.   With
    respect, that is entirely based on the Appellant's claim  to  have  had
    such document confiscated.  Dr Smith does not  seem  to  query  whether
    that is credible nor does he seem to  either  know  or  cross-reference
    that matter with the fact that the Appellant was able to retain her own
    passport.  I find no credible evidence to suggest her national identity
    card was confiscated.  If she has lost it, as she  allegedly  lost  her
    first passport, then no doubt she can get a replacement with  the  same
    reasonable ease that she appeared to obtain a second passport.

56. I find no evidence to indicate why the Appellant could not live in  her
    home area.  I find no evidence to suggest why she and her husband could
    not live in Colombo given the judge on an  earlier  occasion  found  it
    safe for her husband to live there and the  Appellant  has  spent  many
    years in that city herself.

57. In terms of removal the Appellant does not fall within the terms of the
    Immigration Rules.  In respect of residual  judicial  discretion  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR this case does not disclose features that suggest
    that I should exercise that discretion favourably.  In respect  of  the
    Appellant's child that child is 18 months old and therefore very young.
     On the evidence available and applying  proper  inferences  from  such
    evidence the best interests of  that  child  are  to  remain  with  her
    parents.  Therefore it would follow that  the  best  interests  of  the
    child are to be removed with her parents to maintain the family.  It is
    also in my view a proper inference that it  would  be  in  the  child's
    interest to have knowledge of  and  share  time  with  extended  family
    members who exist within Sri Lanka but not within the UK.  It  is  also
    in my view another natural inference that it is in her interest  to  be
    brought up in the country of her nationality,  with  her  own  culture,
    society and attitudes until at least such time she  is  old  enough  to
    make her own informed choice of location.

58. The fact the Appellant may not  have  told  her  parents  that  she  is
    married and has a child is a matter of choice.  The fact that they know
    nothing means that the Appellant has not even tested their reaction  or
    views and has not discharged any burden of proof  in  that  respect  to
    show that they would reject her or their granddaughter.   As  indicated
    above the Appellant's husband is a failed asylum  seeker  whose  appeal
    rights are exhausted and I find no basis for this family  remaining  in
    the UK and nothing disproportionate in  their  removal  together  as  a
    family to their home country of Sri Lanka.
