Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Matthew Sowerby, Counsel instructed by Ince

For the Respondent:    Mr Tony Melvin, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mr Adolf [A], a Russian citizen aged  87,  appeals  with
    permission against the decision of First-tier Judge Row, who  dismissed
    his appeal against the  refusal  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in
    Sheffield to grant him entry clearance to join his daughter  who  lives
    in the United Kingdom.

 2. The appellant is a widower: he has lived alone  since  2011,  when  his
    wife died.  He has a mental health  problem  which  means  that  he  is
    resistant to allowing others to look after him, but the sponsor  visits
    every three months and cooks him food, which he  reheats  himself  when
    she is away, and he has a cleaner, who keeps his  apartment  reasonably
    tidy.

 3. The sponsor, who is 59 years old, is a dual citizen of both the  United
    Kingdom and Russia.  Both  the  appellant  and  sponsor  are  receiving
    Russian state pensions.  The sponsor has a business working as  a  tour
    guide in the United Kingdom, which she has established over a number of
    years: she is still working.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted  the  limited  evidence  of  the
    appellant's mental  health  condition,  and  stated  that  he  had  had
    considered the detailed evidence at pages 36 to 63, which would include
    the report of Dr Dobrokhotov.   The Judge accepted that  the  appellant
    has a number of very significant health  conditions,  meaning  that  he
    requires long term personal care.  "The evidence is that he is unlikely
    to accept such care but nonetheless he does require it.  The issue then
    is whether this care can be provided in Russia".

 5. The Judge noted the sponsor's evidence that she was not prepared to  go
    back to Russia to assist her father because she had a life and  a  tour
    guiding business in the United Kingdom.  The sponsor  has  a  son,  the
    appellant's grandson, who lives in Moscow with his wife and family, but
    the evidence was that he was not close to the  appellant  and  was  not
    prepared to assist his grandfather.

 6. The Judge took into account the lack of state residential care, as well
    as a letter evidencing the availability of private residential care, at
    a cost of 27,000 roubles per month (about �318).  The  Judge  concluded
    that:

         "23. None of these documents assists the appellant much.  They  are
             concerned with the provision of residential social care.  They
             do not deal at all with what  practical  assistance  could  be
             provided to the appellant in his home and at what cost.

         24.  The evidence from the sponsor and from the  cleaner  was  that
             the appellant lives alone.   He  does  not  accept  assistance
             easily.  The sponsor prepares frozen meals for  him  when  she
             goes there and he heats these up himself.  He does  not  bathe
             regularly.  He has  difficulty  treating  his  ulcerated  legs
             properly.  His obsessive nature makes it difficult for anyone,
             including the sponsor, to assist him as he does not like to be
             touched.  He would face that difficulty even if he were in the
             United Kingdom.

         25.  The sponsor has not dealt with the issue of the  provision  of
             care in his home.  Such  care  seems  to  be  available.   The
             cleaner refers to it in  her  letter.   I  do  not  know  what
             services the providers listed at pages 98-112 can provide  and
             at what  cost  because  the  sponsor  has  not  provided  this
             information.

         26.  In any event Zabota can provide assisted residential care  for
             �318 per month.  This does not seem expensive.  It  is  a  lot
             less than such care would cost in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
             sponsor said that the appellant has a pension of 24,000 rubles
             per month.  The sponsor has a state pension of  14,000  rubles
             per month and income from her business of roughly �30,000  per
             annum.  Residential care in Russia would seem to be affordable
             and can be privately obtained even if the state services  were
             inadequate.  It would seem likely that assisted care  for  the
             appellant in his home would cost a lot less than this although
             no information was provided about this."

 7. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the First-tier Judge
    had arguably failed properly to consider  the  medical  evidence  which
    appears at pages 47-50 of the appeal  bundle,  and  in  particular  had
    failed to give  proper  consideration  to  comments  made  by  Dr  M  Z
    Dobrokhotov of the Republican Psychiatric Hospital,  which  appears  at
    page 48 of the appeal bundle.  There is no  challenge  to  the  finding
    that Article 8 ECHR does not avail the appellant.

 8. Mr Sowerby for the appellant argued that the Judge's assessment of  the
    evidence was inadequate and that the appellant had shown that he  could
    meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.   He  relied  on  the
    evidence  of  Dr  Dobrokhotov  and  the  Zabota  letter  about  private
    residential care in Russia.  Neither document is long or detailed.

 9. Dr Dobrokhotov's opinion is very brief:

         "This document is given to [Adolf A], born on 05.10.1932,  residing
         at: city of Cheboksary, K. Ivanova  Street,  56A,  to  confirm  the
         mental disorder diagnosis F42.2,  F42.3  according  to  the  ICD-10
         (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision).

         The patient expresses thoughts and  performs  actions  and  rituals
         that prevent him from communicating with and  accepting  care  from
         others.  After the death of his wife, the patient has  been  living
         alone since 2011 and developed distinct inabilities in self-care.

         The disorders are hereditary; they  have  been  impeding  patient's
         active socialization throughout his life and force the  patient  to
         avoid direct body contacts with people outside the family circle.

         These disorders make it impossible to conduct necessary medical and
         hygienic procedures; they limit normal urination and defecation and
         prevent medical procedures, including vital ones, from  being  done
         by unfamiliar persons, such as doctors, nurses, medical attendants,
         social workers.

         The patient requires constant care."

10. It is not clear why this resistance to personal care is  considered  to
    be hereditary.   There  is  no  suggestion  that  the  sponsor  or  the
    appellant's grandson have the same problem.   The  appellant  has  been
    living alone in Russia for  nine  years,  since  he  was  widowed,  and
    photographs in the bundle show that while he has severe leg ulcers, the
    apartment and the appellant are clean and tidy and  his  freezer  still
    full of  food,  presumably  cooked  by  the  sponsor.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge took Dr Dobrokhotov's letter at its highest,  which  was
    the correct approach.

11. The  letter  from  Zabota  merely  records  that  residential  care  is
    available, and at what cost:

         "Given to [SA] to certify that the cost of stay for one  person  in
         the Zabota assisted living residence for elderly  people  is  1,000
         (one thousand) roubles  per  day,  which  is  27,000  (twenty-seven
         thousand) roubles per month."

    No further details of the available care at the  Zabota  residence  are
    provided.  There has  been  no  investigation  whether  care  could  be
    provided for the appellant at home, over and  above  what  his  cleaner
    already provides.

Conclusions

12. The Upper Tribunal may interfere with findings of fact only in the very
    limited circumstances explained by Lord Justice Brooke at paragraph  92
    of R (Iran) & Ors v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2005]
    EWCA Civ 982, and  that  standard  is  not  met  here.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  considered  all  relevant  material  in  the   bundle,
    including Dr Dobrokhotov's letter and the  Zabota  letter,  neither  of
    which gives much detail.

13. Both were given appropriate weight and the  Judge  reached  sustainable
    findings of fact and credibility, based on the totality of the evidence
    before him.

Decision

14. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:


    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law


    I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
