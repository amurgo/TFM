                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Sierra Leone born in 1979. He  applied
       to remain in the UK as the spouse of Ms  Aminata  Jabbie  who  is  a
       citizen of Ireland. The application was refused by the respondent on
       the basis it was not accepted that Ms Jabbie was working as  claimed
       in a decision dated 30th  November  2015.  His  appeal  against  the
       decision was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Seelhoff  in  a
       determination promulgated on the 3rd April 2017.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Kamara  on
       8th January 2018 on the basis that it was arguable that  the  First-
       tier judge had erred in law in finding Ms  Jabbie's  employment  was
       not genuine and effective.

    3. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    4. The appellant argues that the First-tier Tribunal  errs  in  finding
       that he is not entitled to an  EEA  residence  permit  as  a  family
       member due to the finding that the appellant  was  not  a  qualified
       person by virtue of her work. It is said that it  is  accepted  that
       the appellant has been employed by Sainsbury's since  May  2015  and
       remains  so  employed  (see  paragraphs  3,11,  12  and  24  of  the
       decision). The  appellant  had  returned  from  maternity  leave  in
       January 2017 on reduced hours of 16 hours a  week  compared  to  her
       prematernity leave hours of 32 hours a week, and  then  had  holiday
       owing which she took in January and February  2017,  and  which  was
       thus reflected in her payslips up until March 2017.

    5. It is said that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  firstly  by  finding
       that being paid holiday pay by her employer was not the same  as  Ms
       Jabbie being a worker, see paragraph 22 of the  decision.  This  was
       contrary to the case of Genc v Land of  Berlin  14/09,  and  clearly
       being paid holiday pay was an indication of being in employment.

    6. Secondly it is said that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  by  finding
       that Ms Jabbie's work was not genuine and effective. She was working
       16 hours a week from January 2017. The duration of the employment is
       only one factor  to  take  into  account  and  not  conclusive  when
       determining whether someone is a worker under EEA law, see  Barry  v
       London Borough of Southwark [2008] EWCA Civ 1440.  The  question  is
       whether it is so little time and money that it is unrelated  to  the
       lifestyle of a worker, as explained in the respondent's own guidance
       an example would be a student who works for two hours a week in  the
       student union bar.

    7. Thirdly it is said that the First-tier Tribunal made a factual error
       with respect to the appellant's immigration record  as  he  did  not
       return from Sierra  Leone  with  a  family  permit  as  set  out  at
       paragraph 2  of  the  decision,  which  shows  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal has not properly appreciated the full facts  of  the  case.



    8. Mr Ogunnabi argued that the First-tier Tribunal  had  failed  to  be
       guided by EU law cases which he had set out in his grounds of appeal
       which indicated that the whole picture had to be examined. Ms Jabbie
       had a contract of employment, she was paying pension  contributions,
       she was contracted to work between 76 and 80 hours a month, and  had
       income from work as well as holiday pay in her final payslip.

    9. There was no Rule 24 notice but Mr Lindsay  argued  that  there  was
       nothing in the third point. I agreed with this observation. He  took
       the first two together and argued that the First-tier  Tribunal  had
       found that  Ms  Jabbie  was  employed  but  not  doing  genuine  and
       effective work as she was on holiday  leave,  and  even  if  it  was
       accepted that this holiday leave had accrued in her maternity  leave
       it meant that she could not, at that point, be seen as  a  qualified
       person as a worker. She should have waited and applied later  for  a
       residence permit when she had the payslip to show she  was  actually
       working, or produced alternative documentary evidence. It  had  also
       been an issue before the First-tier Tribunal that the documents  had
       not been properly ordered by the appellant.

Conclusions - Error of Law

   10. The First-tier Tribunal correctly directs itself to  the  definition
       of worker and the need for work simply to be genuine  and  effective
       and not marginal and ancillary at paragraph 6 of the decision.

   11. I find however that the First-tier Tribunal erred  not  focusing  on
       whether the work she did was genuine and  effective  in  an  overall
       sense. The history of her employment  seems  to  have  been  brought
       irrelevantly  into  play  prior  to  her  current  employment   with
       Sainsburys when the primary question was whether she was currently a
       worker and not whether she  had  been  in  the  past  with  previous
       employers. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was that  she
       was employed with Sainsbury's as a customer services  assistant  and
       had submitted a contract of employment with them dated 2nd June 2015
       and had remained in employment with them since that  time  having  a
       year off (as is her right) for maternity leave between January  2016
       to January 2017. Prior to this period of maternity leave, so between
       June 2015 and December 2015, Ms Jabbie earned �6241 in seven months,
       which is �891 a month. It is unclear whether the First-tier Tribunal
       found Ms Jabbie to be a worker at this stage, at paragraph 20 of the
       decision, but if it did not this was  undoubtedly  erroneous  as  an
       irrational conclusion on the evidence before the Tribunal.  She  had
       full employment rights in the UK and was not working a  minimal,  or
       marginally and ancillary, amount of time as reflected  in  her  wage
       and was doing a real and effective job in the employment market.

   12. As stated, if in rather vague terms, at paragraph 21 of the decision
       maternity leave continues a worker's status. In the case  of  Jessie
       Saint Prix v Department of Work and Pensions C-507/12  the  European
       Court of Justice found that a woman who gives up work  in  the  late
       stages of pregnancy and the  aftermath  of  childbirth  retains  the
       status of worker.

   13. The position of the First-tier Tribunal, set out at paragraph 24  of
       the decision, that the appellant might not be a worker even  if  she
       worked 16 hours a  week  for  Sainsbury's  as  a  customer  services
       assistant because she earns below the "primary  earnings  threshold"
       is plainly irrational and erroneous. This  level  of  real  work  is
       clearly genuine and effective when considered in the context of what
       she was doing, see Levin v Staatesseretaris  van  Justitie  C-53/81.
       The questions that then arises is whether it was open to the  First-
       tier Tribunal to find that she was not doing this level of work.

   14. I find that the decision that whilst on paid holiday leave Ms Jabbie
       was not a worker to be erroneous due to insufficient  reasoning:  no
       case law is cited in support of  this  proposition  concerning  paid
       holiday leave, which would mean that those properly  employed  would
       cease to be workers whenever they were on holiday, and it fails,  as
       Mr Ogunnabi has argued, to look at all the aspects  of  Ms  Jabbie's
       position as set out as the lawful approach by the Court of Appeal in
       Barry v London Borough of Southwark and in ECJ cases such as Genc  v
       Land of Berlin.

   15. I also find however that there is a more obvious error of law in the
       decision. The First-tier Tribunal was obliged to consider whether Ms
       Jabbie's own evidence that she was no longer on paid  holiday  leave
       but was working 16 hours a week at the time of hearing as a customer
       services assistant was credible.  She  was  not  in  a  position  to
       produce a payslip demonstrating this as her evidence  was  that  her
       situation had changed since her last one and the next  one  was  not
       due to be issued until after the date of hearing. If she was telling
       the truth then there was no issue  of  her  being  on  paid  holiday
       leave, and it was a straightforward issue of whether 16 hours a week
       work with Sainsburys, with a contract for this amount  of  time,  on
       the check-out made her a worker in EU law. As indicated above I find
       that such evidence, if  accepted,  unarguably  would  have  made  Ms
       Jabbie a worker. This was therefore material evidence and the First-
       tier Tribunal needed to decide whether it accepted that evidence and
       failed to do so.

Submissions - Remaking

   16. Mr Lindsay looked at the originals of Ms Jabbie's current employment
       documents from Sainsburys. These show that  she  has  been  employed
       since 2015 on a contract for  16  hours  work  per  week,  and  from
       January 2018 she is on a new  period  of  maternity  leave.  He  was
       satisfied that these documents were genuine. He invited me to make a
       decision on the evidence.

Conclusions - Remaking

   17. I find that Ms Jabbie has been  a  worker  employed  with  Sainsbury
       since June 2015 as a customer services assistant on a 16 hour a week
       contract, which I find to be genuine and  effective  work,  and  has
       evidenced being on maternity  leave  from  this  employment  at  the
       current time. Applying Jessie Saint Prix v Department  of  Work  and
       Pensions I find that Ms Jabbie remains a worker at the current time.



   18. As Ms Jabbie is a worker in community  law  then  her  husband,  the
       appellant, is entitled to an EU residence card as her family member.





          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

   3. I re-make the decision in the appeal by  allowing  it  under  the  EEA
      Regulations.

Fee Award        Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee award. I have  had
    regard  to  the  Joint  Presidential  Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards   in
    Immigration Appeals. I have decided to make no fee  award  because  the
    outcome of the appeal relied upon evidence produced  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal and because no such award was pursued by the appellant.
