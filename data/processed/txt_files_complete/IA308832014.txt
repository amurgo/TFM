Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr V Jagadeshum, instructed by Farani Javid Taylor
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Affan Rasheed, date of birth 2.9.83,  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Lambert promulgated 1.10.14, dismissing his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 19.7.14, to refuse leave to enter the
    United Kingdom and to cancel his leave under paragraph 321A(2)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 24.9.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kelly  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    14.11.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 2.3.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. For the reasons set out in my error of law decision, I found that there
    were errors of law in the making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal such that it should be set aside and remade.

 6. In particular, I found that there was insufficient evidence before  the
    First-tier Tribunal to discharge the burden on the Secretary  of  State
    to demonstrate on the balance of probabilities and with cogent evidence
    that deception/dishonesty had been used in the previous application for
    leave. The issue was not the use of the witness statements,  explaining
    the process of examination of suspected test results, common to most of
    the similar appeals, but rather the absence of cogent evidence directly
    linking this appellant to the invalidity conclusion.

 7. In particular, I noted that the actual test  certificate  submitted  by
    the appellant had not been produced by the Secretary of State; the  one
    in the bundle was an earlier certificate, taken in 2011. There was only
    a two-sided sheet, on  which  the  appellant's  name  is  misspelt  and
    inverted, and which asserts that it was a 'clip' from a larger file and
    matched to the appellant by his passport  identity.  The  Secretary  of
    State relied on "information sent to us by ETS," and was  thus  second-
    hand. As I stated at �15 and �16 of the error of law decision, "Without
    the test certificate, neither the  certificate  number,  nor  the  test
    centre, nor the test date, nor the test results can be  confirmed.  The
    only matter that can be confirmed is the date of birth.  The  appellant
    was uncertain in his interview which test centre he had used. The  test
    certificate produced in the appellant's bundle is irrelevant as  it  is
    not the one used in the application for leave. The respondent's  bundle
    does not include  either  the  application  or  the  test  certificate.
    Bearing in mind the very significant effect for the  appellant  of  the
    cancellation of leave decision has, both for his present claim to study
    and any future application for entry clearance, the evidence which  was
    available to  the  Tribunal  was  woefully  inadequate  to  demonstrate
    deception by this appellant."

 8. Having found an error of law I adjourned the remaking of  the  decision
    to a further hearing before myself in the Upper  Tribunal,  which  this
    is. I gave leave for either party to adduce further evidence  from  ETS
    or elsewhere to demonstrate that the invalidated test result related to
    this appellant. No such evidence has been produced.   The  Tribunal  is
    thus left in the same position as at  the  error  of  law  hearing.  Mr
    McVeety maintained the Secretary of State's position that the  evidence
    adduced was sufficient, but in the light of my error  of  law  findings
    and  the  absence  of  any  further  evidence  I  do  not  accept  that
    submission.

 9. In the circumstances,  for  the  reasons  stated  the  appeal  must  be
    allowed.

10. There was some confusion during the hearing caused by  the  grounds  of
    appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  complain  about  a  removal
    decision made under section 10 of the 1999 Act. If  there  was  such  a
    decision, there is no in-country right of appeal. However,  even  after
    time taken to check the Home Office files, Mr  McVeety  was  unable  to
    confirm that there had been any section 10 decision.  It  follows  that
    the decision did entitled the  appellant  to  an  in-country  right  of
    appeal pursuant to section 82 of the 2002 Act.

Conclusion and Decision:

11. For the reasons set out above, I find that the Secretary of  State  has
    failed to discharge the burden of proof to show by cogent evidence  and
    on the balance of probabilities that deception/dishonesty was  used  in
    the previous application for leave in relation to an  English  language
    test certificate so as to justify the mandatory ground for  refusal  of
    entry and cancellation of existing leave under paragraph 321A(2) of the
    Immigration Rules.

12. The appeal is allowed on immigration grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.






Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a full fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been allowed.
