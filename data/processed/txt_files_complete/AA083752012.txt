For the Appellant: Mr Saeed of Aman Solicitors Advocates
For the Respondent: Mr Hussain - Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



     1. The Appellant, a citizen of Iraq, was born on  1  June  1988.   Her
        immigration history shows that on 16th August 2010 she applied  for
        a settlement visa in order to join  her  husband  Mr  Ali  Mohammed
        Husein, a former Iraqi national but now a British citizen, in  this
        country. The application was refused on  8th  March  2011  and  her
        appeal against that decision dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge
        Shanahan on 24th October 2011.  Permission to appeal was granted to
        the Upper Tribunal and the matter heard by me on  14th  March  2012
        with appeal number OA/11803/2011. It was found that although  Judge
        Shanahan had made errors they were not material to the decision  to
        dismiss the appeal. Paragraph 73 of  my  determination  is  in  the
        following terms:


              73. I therefore find it has not been shown that Judge Shanahan
   made  a  material                   error  of  law  in  relation  to  her
   assessment of  the  appellant's  ability  to  meet                    the
   requirements of the Rules or in relation to Article 8 on the basis of the
                  evidence that she  was  asked  to  consider.  This  was  a
   decision  made  on  the                   basis  of  the  evidence   made
   available to Judge Shanahan at the date of that                  hearing.
   I have found that the finding in relation to 320 (3)  and  (7A)  are  not
          sustainable. It is therefore open to the appellant to make a fresh
   application.                 If such an application is made she must note
   the concerns of both the Judge                and  ECO  relating  to  her
   ability   to   satisfy   the   rules    and    ensure    that    adequate
   evidence is provided from both her and the sponsor. It may then  be  that
          her application will succeed.


     2. Instead of making a fresh application to secure a  settlement  visa
        lawfully the Appellant left Iraq on 10th July 2012 and entered  the
        United Kingdom illegally on 6th August 2012 after which she claimed
        asylum.


     3. Her appeal against the refusal of her asylum  claim  was  heard  by
        First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan at Birmingham on the 22nd  October
        2012 who set out his findings from paragraph 6 of the determination
        which, in relation to  the  asylum,  humanitarian  protection,  and
        Article 3 claims, can be summarised as follows:




          i.  The Appellants claim based upon a fear from her father was not
   credible.           Her account simply does not make sense [6].


          ii. It sounds incredible that the Appellant had a week  to  gather
   information             about her husband  and  where  he  lived  in  the
   United Kingdom but failed             to do so.  It  must  be  remembered
   that  the  Appellant  had  made  an                 application   for   a
   settlement visa and had two appeals in the  United                Kingdom
   and  for  her  to  claim  not  even  to  know  where  her  husband  lived
   in the United Kingdom was not credible [7].


          iii.    Taking as a starting point, when applying  the  Devaseelan
   principles, the              finding the Appellant was not in  a  genuine
   relationship with Mr Husein,               [8],  having  heard  the  oral
   evidence of Mr Husein and having considered            the evidence as  a
   whole, the Judge was not satisfied the parties are in           a genuine
   relationship. The Appellant  is  not  credible  and  the  credibility  of
   her husband is damaged [9].


          iv. It was submitted during the hearing  that  the  Appellant  was
   pregnant but             there  was  no  medical  evidence  to  establish
   pregnancy although even if the            Appellant  was  pregnant  there
   was no evidence to establish that Mr               Husein is the  father.
   The Appellant has failed to discharge the burden            upon  her  to
   prove this fact [10].


          v.  Having had a settlement application refused  and  two  appeals
   dismissed           the Appellant, together with her  family,  devised  a
   plan to  enter  the  United               Kingdom  by  other  means.  The
   Appellant faces no risk from her father  or              anyone  else  in
   Iraq and there is no reason why as a failed asylum seeker             she
   could not return to Iraq and continue  to  reside  with  her  family.  No
   evidence was submitted to establish that returned failed  asylum  seekers
     are at particular risk. On return to Iraq the Appellant faces  no  real
   risk of             persecution, serious harm or ill-treatment [11].


     4. In relation to the Immigration Rules, Judge Chohan's  findings  can
        be summarised as follows:


          i.  The Appellant cannot meet  the  requirements  of  EX.1.(b)  of
   appendix FM             [12].


          ii. In respect her  private  life  paragraph  276ADE  is  relevant
   although in light            of the fact the appellant  is  24  years  of
   age, has lived in the UK for less than             20 years and has  ties
   to    Iraq,    she     is     unable     to     meet     the     specific
   requirements of 276ADE (vi) [13].


          iii.    The Appellant is not able to meet the requirements of  the
   Immigration             Rules [14].


     5. Judge Chohan also dismissed the  claim  under  Article  8  ECHR  in
        relation  to  both  her  family  and  private  life  against  which
        permission to appeal was sought and granted by a  Designated  Judge
        of the First-tier Tribunal on 23rd November 2012.


     6. On the 11th January 2013 the  matter  came  before  Upper  Tribunal
        Judge O'Connor for directions.  One such direction indicated he was
        minded to set the determination  aside  and  so  the  parties  were
        invited to make further submissions  no  later  than  25th  January
        2013.   There  was  no  response  and  accordingly  Judge  O'Connor
        concluded that the First-tier Tribunal's determination contained an
        error of law in its consideration  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
        Article 8 grounds and that it was to be set aside.   The  decisions
        made in relation to the Refugee Convention, humanitarian protection
        and Article 3 ECHR have not been the subject  of  a  challenge  and
        those findings are to remain standing.



The law


     7. There have been a number of cases both within the Tribunal and  the
        Higher Courts which are relevant to this appeal.


     8. The first in time is the decision in in R (on  the  application  of
        Mahmood) v SSHD (2001) 1 WLR 840 in which Laws LJ said  "that  firm
        immigration control requires consistency of treatment  between  one
        aspiring immigrant and another.  If the established rule is to  the
        effect - as it is - that a person seeking rights of residence  here
        on the grounds of marriage (not being someone  who  already  enjoys
        leave, albeit limited, to remain in the UK) must  obtain  an  entry
        clearance in his country, then a waiver  of  that  requirement  for
        someone who has found his way here without an entry  clearance  and
        then  seeks  to  remain  on  marriage  grounds,  having  no   other
        legitimate claim to enter, would  in  the  absence  of  exceptional
        circumstances to justify the waiver,  disrupt  and  undermine  firm
        immigration control because it would be manifestly unfair to  other
        would be entrants who are content to take their place in the  entry
        clearance queue in their own country".


     9.  The House of Lords in Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 said that in
        deciding whether the general policy of requiring people such as the
        Appellant to return to apply for entry in accordance with the rules
        of this country was legitimate and proportionate  in  a  particular
        case, it was necessary to consider what the benefits of the  policy
        were.  Whilst acknowledging the deterrent effect of the policy  the
        House of Lords queried the underlying basis of the policy in  other
        respects and made it clear that the policy should not be applied in
        a rigid, Kafka-esque manner.  The House of Lords  went  on  to  say
        that it would be "comparatively rarely, certainly in  family  cases
        involving children" that an Article 8 case should be  dismissed  on
        the basis that it would be proportionate and more  appropriate  for
        the Appellant to apply for leave from abroad.


    10. In LE (Turkey) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2010]
        CSOH 153 it was held that the combination of a long term breach  of
        immigration control, the recent establishment of a relationship  in
        the full knowledge of such breach and the relative weakness of that
        relationship, militated strongly against the Claimant's  Article  8
        claim, distinguishing Chikwamba and MA (Pakistan)  v  Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 953.


    11. In MH (Pakistan), Petition for judicial review of a decision of the
        Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2011]  CSOH  143  a
        Pakistani visitor  was  arrested  in  connection  with  immigration
        offences after overstaying. He was granted temporary release and in
        April 2010 married a British citizen who had  a  daughter  who,  at
        that time, was approximately 17 years old. The Secretary  of  State
        refused an application as a spouse in December 2010 under Article 8
        ECHR.  It was held that the propriety of  taking  account  of  poor
        immigration history, the precariousness  of  the  position  when  a
        relationship was entered into and the need to maintain  immigration
        control  were  all  confirmed  by  Lady  Hale  in  ZH   (Tanzania).
        Accordingly, the Secretary of State did not err by visiting on  the
        child the behaviour of the Petitioner in the present case.  In  all
        the circumstances of the case, the omission  of  reference  in  the
        decision letter to considering the  best  interests  of  the  child
        first, was not of sufficient materiality to  vitiate  the  decision
        reached (paras 56 - 58).


    12. The Court of Appeal considered this issue further in  Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department v Hayat; Secretary of State  for  the
        Home Department v Treebhowan (Mauritius) [2012] EWCA  Civ  1054  in
        which the Court outlined the following guidance as to the effect of
        Chikwamba and the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in  TG
        (Central African Republic)[2008] EWCA Civ  997  and  SZ  (Zimbabwe)
        [2009] EWCA Civ 590 and MA (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA Civ 953 in  which
        it had been considered:


              (i)      Where an applicant who  did  not  have  lawful  entry
   clearance                    pursued a claim under Article 8, a dismissal
   of the claim on  the                        procedural  ground  that  the
   policy required that the applicant should                   have made the
   application    from     his     home     state     might,     but     not
   necessarily would, constitute a disruption  of  family  or  private  life
          sufficient to engage Article 8, particularly where  children  were
              adversely affected;


               (ii)      Where  Article 8  was  engaged,  it  would  be  a
   disproportionate                      interference with family or private
   life to enforce such a policy unless               there was  a  sensible
   reason for doing so;


              (iii)    Whether it was sensible to enforce that policy  would
   necessarily be                   fact sensitive, and potentially relevant
   factors included the                      prospective length  and  degree
   of disruption of  family  life  and                        whether  other
   members of the family were settled in the UK;


              (iv)     Where Article 8 was engaged and there was no sensible
   reason for                   enforcing the  policy,  the  decision  maker
   should  determine  the                       Article 8  claim  on   its
   substantive merits, having regard to all material                factors,
   notwithstanding   that   the    applicant    had    no    lawful    entry
   clearance;


              (v)      Nothing in Chikwamba was intended to  alter  the  way
   the courts                   should approach substantive Article 8 issues
   as laid down in seminal                   cases as Razgar and Huang;


              (vi)     If the Secretary of State had no sensible reason  for
   requiring the                    application to be  made  from  the  home
   state, the fact that he had               failed  to  do  so  should  not
   thereafter  carry  any  weight  in  the                       substantive
   Article 8 balancing exercise (para 30).









Discussion



    13. Mr Saeed accepted that the Appellant was unable  to  succeed  under
        the  Immigration  Rules  unless  she  is  able   to   satisfy   the
        'insurmountable  obstacles'  requirement  in   paragraph   EX.   To
        establish whether this is the case it is necessary to  analyze  the
        evidence in some detail.


    14. Paragraph EX contains exceptions which, if satisfied may entitle  a
        party to succeed under the Rules even  if  unable  to  satisfy  the
        individual criteria of the relevant  section  applicable  to  them.
        Paragraph EX states:


         Section EX: Exception
         EX.1. This paragraph applies if

              (a) (i) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting parental
relationship with a                 child who-

                       (aa)     is under the age of 18 years, or was under
the age of 18 years                          when the applicant was first
granted leave on the basis that this                           paragraph
applied;
                       (bb)     is in the UK;
                       (cc)     is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK
continuously for at                          least the 7 years immediately
preceding the date of application                         ;and

                  (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
leave the UK; or

              (b)      the applicant has a genuine and subsisting
relationship with a partner who                  is in the UK and is a
British Citizen, settled in the UK or in the UK with               refugee
leave or humanitarian protection, and there are insurmountable
     obstacles to family life with that partner continuing outside the UK.



    15. EX.1. (b) is the exception relied upon and to which reference shall
        be made further below.


    16. When considering Article 8 issues it is necessary to considered the
        questions set out by Lord Bingham in paragraph 17 of the  judgement
        in the case of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 are which are:


        (1)  Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public
        authority with         the exercise of the applicant's right to
        respect for his private or (as the case      may be) family life?


        (2)  If so, will such interference have consequences of such
        gravity as             potentially to engage the operation of
        article 8?


          (3)     If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


        (4)  If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic society
        in the interests       of national security, public safety or the
        economic well- being of the              country, for the
        prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of
        health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms
        of            others?


        (5)  If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate
        public end             sought to be achieved?


    17. During  the  course  of  discussions  with  the  advocates  it  was
        ascertained that the  issue  is  one  of  proportionality  only  in
        relation to Article 8 ECHR in relation to which  no  oral  evidence
        was required.


   The Appellant's case.

    18. The Appellant and her husband both argue that it is not  reasonable
        in all the circumstances for her to be expected to return to Iraq.


    19. Her husband's witness statement dated 11th September  2013  alleges
        he cannot return to Iraq or relocate to Iraq for any period of time
        as he fears his father-in-law will kill him if he travels  to  Iraq
        as well as his wife and his daughter. This claim is repeated in the
        Appellant's own witness statement together with her claim that  she
        was forced to flee from her father. A claim to be at risk from  her
        father for a similar reason was the basis of her asylum claim which
        was rejected by Judge Chohan and which is a preserved finding.  The
        claim was found to lack credibility and for there to be no evidence
        of a real risk on return from this or any other source in Iraq. The
        fact both the Appellant and her husband seek to rely upon a similar
        claim to that which has been found to have no merit  damages  their
        credibility. Their claim to face a risk  on  return  sufficient  to
        engage the Refugee Convention, Qualification Directive and Articles
        2 and 3 has not been substantiated and permission to appeal was not
        granted on this basis.


    20. The Appellant's husband states he is a British citizen employed  in
        the United Kingdom, in part time employment.   He  claims  he  will
        lose his job if he had to travel to Iraq to help his  wife  make  a
        further application for entry clearance. The evidence given to  the
        Upper Tribunal in OA/11803/2011 stated that Mr Husein  is  employed
        as a shop assistant at a pizza shop earning a gross monthly  income
        of �1092.00 per month [determination in  OA/11803/2011,  para  67].
        There is no evidence before me today that he will loose his job  if
        he returns with his wife. He  must  be  entitled  to  annual  leave
        without the fear of loosing his job, in law. This  element  of  the
        claim is unsubstantiated.


    21. The Appellant herself speaks of her journey to the United  Kingdom,
        claims her relationship is genuine, and that she does not  wish  to
        leave her husband. I accept this is an expression of genuinely held
        feelings.


    22. There is also  within  the  bundle  provided  a  copy  of  a  birth
        certificate of their daughter born on 30th May 2013 and which names
        the both the Appellant and her husband as the  biological  parents.
        I am satisfied on the basis of the new evidence  that  family  life
        exists between the Appellant her husband and their  newborn  child,
        which was conceded in any event.  I have also  seen  a  copy  of  a
        letter dated 11th September 2013 claiming the  Appellant  is  again
        pregnant and due to give birth around 17th April 2014.   It  is  of
        course only the position of the daughter born recently  I  have  to
        consider as a foetus is not an individual in a legal sense to  whom
        the ECHR or the statutory provisions apply until  born  although  I
        accept he or she will be part of her mother's private life, but not
        of her fathers until shortly before or at birth.


   The Respondents case


    23. The Secretary of State acknowledges that the Appellant's removal to
        Iraq may interfere with her protected rights under Article  8  ECHR
        but contends that this is proportionate having regard to the public
        interest in maintaining effective immigration control and deterring
        abuse of the system, especially in light of the deliberate  actions
        taken by the Appellant .


   The proportionality assessment




    24. Mr Saeed was asked by me why the Appellant had chosen  to  come  to
        the United Kingdom illegally rather  than  to  re-apply  for  entry
        clearance as suggested in the earlier determination  of  the  Upper
        Tribunal.  He was unable to provide any explanation.  He  was  then
        asked why the parties have chosen to have a family resulting in the
        initial conception and birth  of  their  daughter  and  the  second
        pregnancy knowing that the Appellant's status was not secure as she
        has no permission to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.  He
        could provide no explanation.


    25. It is my primary finding of fact that notwithstanding the Appellant
        and her husband knowing that the  previous  application  for  entry
        clearance had been refused and dismissed by both the First-tier and
        Upper Tribunals, and having received a clear indication of the  way
        in which they should have proceeded  by  making  a  further  lawful
        application for leave to enter, it  was  decided  that  they  would
        attempt to circumvent all immigration  controls;  as  a  result  of
        which the Appellant with the assistance of  an  agent  entered  the
        United Kingdom illegally which must have taken careful planning and
        considerable cost.


    26. I find that having entered the United Kingdom the Appellant applied
        for asylum on grounds that have been found to be without merit  and
        which resulted in adverse credibility findings being  made  against
        her by Judge Chohan. I find this was a deliberate attempt to secure
        a  right  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  by   the   use   of
        misinformation and dishonesty.  The fact  both  the  Appellant  her
        husband appear to be  attempting  to  rely  yet  again  on  similar
        unsubstantiated facts, alleging in inability to remain as a  result
        of risk from family members, damages their credibility.


    27. I find, in the absence of a plausible explanation to the  contrary,
        that the conception and birth of their  daughter  and  the  further
        conception all with in a relatively short period after entering the
        United Kingdom, and whilst the Appellant's  immigration  status  is
        uncertain, is also part of a deliberate attempt to try  and  secure
        the Appellant a right to remain in the United Kingdom, this time on
        the basis of the existence of a child within the family unit.


    28. I accept the Appellant is an Iraqi national and that her husband is
        from Iraq but is now a British national, and that their daughter as
        a result of her father's status is also a British citizen. I accept
        that both the father  and  daughter  by  virtue  of  their  British
        citizenship are also citizens of the European Union.


    29. This case therefore raises an  interesting  point  in  relation  to
        whether in such circumstances and with  such  deliberate  disregard
        for the laws of the United  Kingdom  the  existence  of  the  child
        trumps any attempt by the Secretary of State  to  insist  that  the
        Appellant should return to Iraq and make an application to re-enter
        lawfully.


    30. It  is  argued  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  that  it  would  be
        'Kafkaesque' to require her  to  return  to  Iraq  to  re-apply  in
        accordance  with  the  laws  of  the  United  Kingdom  in  all  the
        circumstances of this matter, based upon  the  case  of  Chikwamba.
        What Mr Saeed failed to address, however, is the text at  paragraph
        41 and paragraph 42 of that case in which Lord Brown of Eaton-under-
        Heywood commented on the policy of deterrence stated:

              "Now I would certainly not say that such an  objective  is  in
         itself necessarily      objectionable.   Sometimes,  I  accept,  it
         would be reasonable and  proportionate  to      take  that  course.
         Indeed  Ekinci  still  seems  to  me  just  such   a   case.    The
         Appellant's immigration history was  appalling  and  he  was  being
         required to   travel no further than to Germany and to wait for  no
         longer than a month for a   decision  on  his  application.   Other
         obviously relevant considerations would be   whether, for  example,
         the  applicant  has  arrived  in  this  country   illegally   (say,
         concealed in the back of a  lorry)  for  good  reason  or  ill.  To
         advance a genuine      asylum claim would, of  course,  be  a  good
         reason.  To enrol as a student would    not.  Also  relevant  would
         be for how long the Secretary of State has delayed  in      dealing
         with the case...In an Article 8 family case the prospective  length
         and  degree of family disruption involved in going  abroad  for  an
         entry clearance   certificate will always be highly  relevant,  and
         there may be good reason to apply   the policy when the ECO  abroad
         is better placed  than  the  immigration  authorities      here  to
         investigate the claim..."
    31. In Ekinci [2003] EWCA Civ 765 the Appellant had entered the  United
        Kingdom illegally and claimed asylum.  He had untruthfully asserted
        that he had  not  previously  sought  asylum  in  another  European
        country when in fact he had been in Germany for  some  eight  years
        and had twice unsuccessfully claimed asylum there.   Shortly  after
        arrangements had been made for his removal back  to  Germany  under
        the Dublin Convention he married a  woman  whom  he  had  known  in
        Turkey and who had since  come  to  the  UK  and  acquired  British
        citizenship.  He then claimed the right to remain here and later  a
        child was born.


    32. It was also a relevant consideration in Chikwamba  that  return  to
        Zimbabwe was said to be to a harsh and unpalatable place.


          8.  In the case of Beoku-Betts v Secretary of State for  the  Home
   Department [2008]            UKHL 39, the  House  has  decided  that  the
   effect on other family members with a              right to  respect  for
   their  family  life  with  the  appellant  must  also   be   taken   into
   account in an appeal to the AIT on human rights grounds. Even if it would
   not be              disproportionate to expect a husband to endure a  few
   months' separation from his           wife, it must  be  disproportionate
   to expect a four year old girl, who was born and            has lived all
   her life here, either to be separated from her  mother  for  some  months
     or to travel with her mother to  endure  the  "harsh  and  unpalatable"
   conditions in           Zimbabwe simply in order  to  enforce  the  entry
   clearance procedures


    33. Although there are regular reports of ongoing sectarian violence in
        Iraq the current country guidance case of HM  and  others  (Article
        15(c)) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 00409(IAC) shows  there  is  no  general
        risk  and  that  failed  asylum  seekers  can  be   returned   with
        appropriate documents which the Respondent  ensures  are  available
        before undertaking any returns to  Baghdad.   Any  claim  that  the
        situation in the Appellant's  home  or  home  area  is  'harsh  and
        unpalatable 'has not been substantiated.


    34. In relation to the submission the Appellant's husband cannot return
        to Iraq, I note he came to the United Kingdom  and  claimed  asylum
        but was not recognised as refugee or granted such status.  There is
        no judicial finding he is at risk on return and the fact he  has  a
        British passport does not prevent him returning with his  wife  per
        se. Although it is claimed the British Embassy  in  Iraq  can  only
        offer limited assistance there is very little evidence to show that
        the Appellant's husband, who lived in Iraq until  he  came  to  the
        United Kingdom in 2002, is specifically at risk at the point return
        or within that country.


    35. In relation to the claim it is unreasonable to expect the Appellant
        to return alone and apply for entry clearance there is no  evidence
        to show the fact she is pregnant prevents  her  returning  and  her
        claim she is at risk from her family  has  been  found  not  to  be
        credible.  There is no evidence to show that her daughter is unable
        to travel with her if the child is dependent upon her mother.
    36. Notwithstanding the above, the issue  of  paramount  importance  in
        this case is the best  interests  of  the  chid.   The  Appellant's
        daughter is approximately four and half months old at the  date  of
        the hearing. She is  an  infant  child  fully  dependent  upon  her
        parents and there is little evidence in the  bundle  regarding  the
        day-to-day arrangements for caring for the child  such  as  whether
        the child is breast or bottle-fed, the roles played by the  parties
        in relation to the child's care and to show the role played by  the
        parents in the child's life in general. Mr Saeed  relied  upon  the
        decision of the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) in  support  of  his
        arguments that the child could not be returned to Iraq and that  it
        will be unreasonable to expect her relocate to, and live in, Iraq.


    37. In 2012 the Supreme Court published the judgment in the case of  HH
        v Deputy Prosecutor for the  Italian  Republic,  Genoa  and  others
        [2012] UKSC 25. Although an extradition case it was referred to  by
        me in the determination of the Upper Tribunal which was  upheld  by
        the Court of Appeal in the case reported  as  SS  (Nigeria)  [2013]
        EWCA Civ 550.  In HH Lady  Hale  gave  the  lead  judgment  and  in
        relation to ZH (Tanzania) she stated at paragraphs 9 to 15  of  the
        judgment:


              9.  I turn, therefore, to ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary  of  State
   for the Home Department                   [2011] UKSC 4, [2011] 2 AC 166.
   This was an expulsion case. The mother had                  been  in  the
   United Kingdom since 1995. She  formed  a  relationship  with  a  British
     citizen and had two children with him, born in 1998 and 2001,  both  of
   whom were               British citizens and had  lived  here  all  their
   lives. They had a  good  relationship  with                their  father,
   although the parents were  now  separated.  Because  of  his  health  and
     other matters, their father would not be able to  look  after  them  if
   their mother were                removed to Tanzania, so they would  have
   to  go  with  her.  Their  mother   had   an                  "appalling"
   immigration history. She had made  three  unsuccessful  applications  for
          asylum, one in her own name and two in false  identities.  Because
   of this she had                  twice been refused leave to remain under
   different  policy  concessions.  An  earlier                human  rights
   application had also been refused, as  was  the  current  claim,  by  the
     Secretary of State, the  immigration  appellate  authorities,  and  the
   Court of Appeal.                 Before  the  case  reached  the  Supreme
   Court, however, the Secretary of State had                  conceded that
   on the particular facts of the  case  removing  the  mother  would  be  a
      disproportionate  interference  with  the  article  8  rights  of  the
   children.
              10. I gave the leading judgment, and all the other members  of
   the court, including                  those who added short judgments  of
   their own, agreed with it. The Strasbourg                   jurisprudence
   had adopted rather different approaches  to  the  assessment  of  article
          8 rights when considering the expulsion of, on the one hand, long-
   settled                       foreigners  who  had   committed   criminal
   offences and, on the other hand, foreigners                  who  had  no
   right to be or remain in the country. In the former  type  of  case,  the
           "best  interests  and  well-being  of  the  children"  had   been
   explicitly recognised as a                factor by the Grand Chamber  in
   �ner v The Netherlands (2006) 45 EHRR 421, at                   para  58.
   In the latter type of case, this was not explicitly listed  as  a  factor
   in, for                 example, Rodrigues  da  Silva,  Hoogkamer  v  The
   Netherlands (2006) 44 EHRR 729,               at para  39.  Nevertheless,
   the  court  had  in  fact  taken  into  account  that  it   was   clearly
   in the best interests  of  the  child  that  her  mother  remain  in  the
   Netherlands.                      Significantly,  the  child's  interests
   prevailed,    "despite    the    fact    that    the     [mother]     was
   residing illegally in the Netherlands at the time of [the child's] birth"
   (para 44). In                Neulinger v Switzerland (2010) 28 BHRC  706,
   the Grand Chamber had held that               "the Convention  cannot  be
   interpreted   in    a    vacuum    but    must    be    interpreted    in
   harmony with the general principles of  international  law"  (para  131).
   These of                course included article 3.1 of the United Nations
   Convention on the Rights of the               Child:
                   "In all actions concerning children,  whether  undertaken
      by public or private social            welfare institutions, courts of
      law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies,             the
      best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration."
              11. I pointed out that "despite the looseness with which these
   terms are sometimes                   used, 'a primary consideration'  is
   not the same as 'the primary consideration', still                   less
   as 'the paramount consideration'" (para 25). Where the decision  directly
                  affects the child's upbringing, such as  the  decision  to
   separate a child from her                 parents, then the child's  best
   interests      are      the      paramount,       or       determinative,
   consideration. Where the decision affects the child more indirectly, such
   as the                  decision to separate one of the parents from  the
   child, for example by detention or                 deportation, then  the
   child's   interests   are   a   primary,   but   not    the    paramount,
   consideration (para 25). As the Federal Court of Australia had  explained
   in  Wan  v                 Minister  for  Immigration  and  Multicultural
   Affairs (2001) 107 FCR 133, at para 32:
                   "[The tribunal] was required to identify  what  the  best
      interests of Mr Wan's children              required with  respect  to
      the  exercise  of  its  discretion  and   then   to   assess   whether
      the strength of any other consideration, or the cumulative  weight  of
      other                considerations, outweighed the  consideration  of
      the best  interests  of  the  children               understood  as  a
      primary consideration."
              12. Although nationality was not a  "trump  card"  it  was  of
   particular  importance   in                        assessing   the   best
   interests  of  any  child  (para  30).  As  citizens  the  children   had
   rights which they would not be able to exercise if they moved to  another
   country                  (para  32).  We   now   had   a   much   greater
   understanding  of  the  importance  of  such                  issues   in
   assessing the overall well-being of the child:
                   "In making the proportionality assessment  under  article
      8, the best  interests  of  the            child  must  be  a  primary
      consideration.   This   means   that   they   must    be    considered
      first. They can, of course, be outweighed by the cumulative effect  of
      other                considerations".
                    The  countervailing  considerations  were  the  need  to
      maintain  firm  and  fair                  immigrations  control,  the
      mother's immigration history and the precariousness of             her
      position when family life was created. But the children were not to be
      blamed           for that (para 33).
              13. Lord Hope also stressed the importance of  the  children's
   citizenship as "a very                significant and weighty factor"  in
   the     overall     assessment     of      what      was      in      the
   children's best interests (para 41) and,  more  fundamentally,  that  "it
   would be wrong                   in principle  to  devalue  what  was  in
   their best interests by something for which they                could  in
   no way be held responsible", such as the suspicion that they  might  have
          been conceived as a way of strengthening  the  mother's  case  for
   being allowed to                 remain here (para 44).
              14. Lord Kerr put it even more strongly. It  is  "a  universal
   theme" of both international                  and domestic instruments:
                   "that, in reaching decisions that will  affect  a  child,
      primacy of importance must be               accorded  to  his  or  her
      best interests. This is not, it  is  agreed,  a  factor  of  limitless
      importance  in  the  sense  that  it  will  prevail  over  all   other
      considerations. It is a            factor,  however,  that  must  rank
      higher    than    any    other.    It    is     not     merely     one
      consideration that weighs in the  balance  alongside  other  competing
      factors. Where            the best  interests  of  the  child  clearly
      favour a certain course,  that  course  should  be            followed
      unless countervailing reasons of  considerable  force  displace  them"
      (para            46).
              15. However the matter is put, therefore, ZH  (Tanzania)  made
   it clear that in                      considering article 8 in  any  case
   in   which   the   rights   of   a   child   are   involved,   the   best
   interests of the child must be  a  primary  consideration.  They  may  be
   outweighed by                countervailing  factors,  but  they  are  of
   primary importance. The importance of the                   child's  best
   interests is not to be devalued by something for which she is in  no  way
          responsible,  such  as  the  suspicion  that  she  may  have  been
   deliberately conceived                in order to strengthen the parents'
   case.


    38. Lady Hale clearly reinforces  the  importance  of  considering  the
        child's best interests as a primary consideration which  cannot  be
        devalued by things for which the Appellant's daughter is in no  way
        responsible such as the deliberate and  deceitful  actions  of  her
        parents. The fact British nationality is not a 'trump card' is also
        repeated which is applicable to both the child and her father.


    39. This child is an infant and incapable of providing a view  of  what
        she wants but guidance in the assessment of 'best interests', which
        is a question of fact in all cases, has been provided in cases such
        as Azimi-Moayed and others (decisions  affecting  children;  onward
        appeals)[2013] UKUT 197(IAC) (Blake J). In this case  the  Tribunal
        held that:


              (i)      The case law of the Upper Tribunal has identified the
   following                    principles to assist in the determination of
   appeals  where  children                 are  affected  by  the  appealed
   decisions:


                  (a)  As a starting point it is in the  best  interests  of
   children to be                        with both their parents and if both
   parents are being removed                      from  the  United  Kingdom
   then the starting point  suggests  that                        so  should
   dependent    children    who    form    part    of    their     household
   unless there are reasons to the contrary;


              (ii)     It is generally in the interests of children to  have
   both stability and               continuity  of  social  and  educational
   provision and the benefit of                  growing up in the  cultural
   norms of the society to which they belong;


              (iii)    Lengthy residence in a country other than  the  state
   of origin can lead               to development of  social  cultural  and
   educational  ties  that  it  would                 be  inappropriate   to
   disrupt, in the  absence  of  compelling  reason  to                  the
   contrary. What  amounts  to  lengthy  residence  is  not  clear  cut  but
     past and present policies have identified seven  years  as  a  relevant
          period;


              (iv)  Apart from the terms of published  policies  and  rules,
   the Tribunal                 notes that seven  years  from  age  four  is
   likely to be more significant to                   a child that the first
   seven years of life. Very young children are                     focussed
   on their parents rather than their peers and are adaptable;


              (v)      Short periods of residence, particularly ones without
   leave or the                 reasonable expectation of leave to enter  or
   remain,  while  claims  are                   promptly  considered,   are
   unlikely to give rise to private life                       deserving  of
   respect   in   the   absence   of    exceptional    factors.    In    any
   event,  protection  of  the  economic   well-being   of   society   amply
     justifies removal in such cases.


    40. I also note that the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania)  did  not  rule
        that the ability of a young child to readily adapt to life in a new
        country was an irrelevant factor, but rather that the  adaptability
        of the child in each case must be assessed and is not a  conclusive
        consideration on its own.


    41. When one considers the witness statements of the Appellant and  her
        husband  it  can  be  seen  that  there  is  little,  if  anything,
        addressing this specific issue based upon the needs of  the  child.
        It is accepted that an infant child needs a  close  bond  with  her
        parents to  meet  basic  requirements  of  food,  warmth,  shelter,
        supervision, education, and to be loved to enable her to develop to
        maximise his  or  her  potential.  In  his  skeleton  argument,  at
        paragraph 17, Mr Saeed refers to the relevant statutory  provisions
        and ZH (Tanzania) and submits that it is in the best  interests  of
        the child to remain with both her parents in the United Kingdom and
        that it is unreasonable  to  expect  the  appellant's  daughter  to
        relocate and live in Iraq, although the only reason  given  appears
        to be an implied reference to the fact she is a British citizen.


    42. It may of course be that this is all that the Appellant is able  to
        advance in support of this aspect of the appeal  as  recognised  by
        the fact a child of this age  is  focused  mainly  on  her  parents
        rather than peers.  The fact such a young child is  also  adaptable
        to change is a relevant factor and there is no evidence  indicating
        any specific need for the child to remain in the United Kingdom for
        her needs to be met. As stated above there was no evidence relating
        to the role individuals play in the child's life and in SS  Nigeria
        V  SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  550  Mr  Justice  Mann   said   "...the
        circumstances in which the Tribunal will require further  inquiries
        to be made, or evidence to be obtained, (about the children's  best
        interests) are likely to be extremely rare. In the vast majority of
        cases the Tribunal will expect the relevant interests of the  child
        to  be  drawn  to  the  attention  of  the  decision-maker  by  the
        individual concerned.  The  decision-maker  would  then  make  such
        additional  inquiries  as  might  appear  to  him  or  her  to   be
        appropriate. The scope for  the  Tribunal  to  require,  much  less
        indulge in, further  inquiries  of  its  own  seems  to  me  to  be
        extremely limited, almost to the extent that  I  find  it  hard  to
        imagine when, or how, it could do so".


    43. Provided the child remains with her parents or at least one of them
        who is capable of  meeting  her  basic  needs  as  an  infant,  the
        evidence suggests that the child's best interests will be  met.   I
        accept it is not in the child's best interest to be separated  from
        both parents but I do not find it proved that such separation needs
        to occur especially as the reasons it is alleged her father  cannot
        return to Iraq are unsubstantiated.


    44. As a result of being British citizens both the child and her father
        are also  European  citizens.   I  have  therefore  considered  the
        decision in Sanade  and  others  (British  children  -  Zambrano  -
        Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC). In this  case  the  Tribunal  held
        that Case C-34/09 Ruiz Zambrano , BAILII: [2011] EUECJ C-34/09 "now
        makes it clear that where the child or indeed the remaining  spouse
        is a British citizen and therefore a citizen of the European Union,
        as a matter of EU law it is not possible to require the family as a
        unit to relocate outside of the European Union or for the Secretary
        of State to submit that it would be reasonable for them to do so".


    45. The difficulty with a finding expressed in such absolute  terms  is
        that if it is correct then in practice nearly all domestic case law
        in this jurisdiction regarding the reasonableness of return by  one
        spouse to join another is now irrelevant where there is a  European
        element.   It  appears  the  Tribunal  also  failed  to  adequately
        consider the doctrine of proportionality which is a  key  principle
        of European law.


    46. In this case were not talking about an infant child to is  able  to
        exercise many rights as  a  European  citizen  as  she  is  totally
        dependent upon her parents.  Her father is  also  European  citizen
        and the proposal at this stage is that they can return to Iraq with
        their mother/wife while she makes an application  to  re-enter  the
        United Kingdom lawfully.  In  such  a  scenario  it  is  not  being
        proposed that  the  family  relocate  outside  the  European  Union
        permanently and any period of absence must be proportionate.  I  do
        not find that this doctrine on the facts of  this  case  makes  the
        Secretary of State's proposal unlawful.


    47. When  considering  proportionally  generally  it  is  necessary  to
        consider the claim in the  grounds  that  it  was  unreasonable  to
        expect the family to return, even to make a lawful application,  as
        there are no facilities in Iraq for such an application to be  made
        although this was withdrawn before the Tribunal by Mr Saeed on  the
        basis that entry clearance facilities have  been  set  up  in  Iraq
        itself  in  addition  to  those  in  surrounding  countries.    The
        Appellant was  able  to  make  a  previous  application  for  entry
        clearance and it has not been shown that she is unable to do so  in
        the future or that any delay in the  application  process  will  be
        lengthy such as to make the requirement disproportionate.


     48. If the Appellant, her husband, and their daughter  return  together
         there will be no loss of family life.  If it is  decided  that  she
         returns alone to make the  application  leaving  her  daughter  and
         husband in he United Kingdom or she travels with her  daughter  and
         her husband remains in this country, in  the  absence  of  evidence
         that the process will be unnecessarily lengthy, any disruption will
         be proportionate.


    49. It is also necessary to consider the issue of prospects of success,
        as submitted  by  Mr  Saeed,  when  considering  reasonableness  of
        return. In Hayat at paragraph 17, Elias LJ states:

         17.  In Chikwamba the Article 8 claim was particularly strong.  But
in my view it is clear from             paragraph 44 of  his  judgment  that
Lord Brown's objection to the routine enforcement  of            the  policy
was not limited to such  cases.  His  observation  that  a  one-stop  appeal
process           should generally be adopted is  equally  valid  where  the
claim might appear to be weak. It            is true  that  the  enforcement
of  the  policy  is  likely  to   be   particularly   futile   where   entry
clearance will ultimately be granted because it  is  requiring  a  temporary
disruption of              family life for no good purpose. To that  extent,
a preliminary assessment  that  the                 substantive  merits  are
strong  may  be  relevant  to  determining   whether   the   policy   should
be enforced or not. But often the merits will not be clear until  a  careful
assessment of the               facts is made, and  the  dogmatic  adherence
to policy may in  those  cases  too  be  a                  disproportionate
interference with Article 8 rights.


    50. Mr Saeed submitted that the Appellant will be unable to succeed  if
        she made a fresh application.  The relevant  part  of  Appendix  FM
        relating to entry clearance is the 'partner' section  EC-P.  It  is
        accepted that the Appellant's husband satisfies the definition of a
        'partner '.  The Appellant will be outside the United  Kingdom  and
        would have made a  valid  application  for  entry  clearance  as  a
        partner meeting the requirements of EC-P.1.1.   Provided  it  is  a
        truthful application there is no evidence that she will fall to  be
        refused under the grounds in section S-EC and it will therefore  be
        necessary for her to  prove  she  meets  all  the  requirements  of
        section E-ECP.


    51. The evidence clearly shows the Appellant is  able  to  satisfy  the
        requirements of E-ECP.2.1 to 2.10, described as  the  'relationship
        requirements'.


    52.  The  financial  requirements  require  the  Appellant  to  provide
        specific evidence from listed sources of a specified  gross  annual
        income of at least �18,600 for her and her husband together with an
        additional �3,800 for their daughter, totalling  �22,400.   I  have
        not calculated any additional element for the child  the  Appellant
        is carrying for the reasons set out above. There is little evidence
        regarding the husbands financial position save for his  claim  that
        he works part time  in  a  pizza  takeaway.  In  OA/11803/2011  the
        Appellant's husband's evidence was that he received a gross  income
        of just over �13,000 but insufficient evidence  has  been  provided
        for this appeal to establish his true financial situation.  I  also
        note in relation to the financial requirements of the rules that in
        MM and Others v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2013]
        EWHC 1900 (Admin) it was held that the SSHD's June 2012  amendments
        to the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as  amended)  concerning  the
        maintenance requirements for the admission of spouses  to  the  UK,
        including raising the minimum income level to be provided by  a  UK
        sponsor to �18,600, had a legitimate aim in promoting measures that
        required spouses to be maintained at a somewhat higher  level  than
        the bare subsistence level set under  previous  interpretations  of
        the Rules. The measures were, however, so onerous in effect  as  to
        be  an  unjustified  and  disproportionate  interference  with  the
        ability of spouses to live together contrary to their rights  under
        Article 8 of the ECHR.


    53.  Even  if  the  Appellant  is  unable  to  satisfy   the   specific
        requirements of the Rules due to this issue alone, the decision  in
        MM indicates this will not  be  a  bar  to  her  succeeding  in  an
        application which will no doubt be made both under  the  Rules  and
        Article 8 ECHR.


    54. There are unlikely to be any concerns regarding the ability to meet
        E-ECP.3.4 as the parties are clearly adequately  accommodated  with
        the child.


    55. Mr Saeed raised the issue of the ability of the Appellant  to  meet
        the English language requirement, E-ECP.4.1 as it is unlikely  that
        she is going to be exempt  from  this  requirement.   There  is  no
        evidence that she currently has an English-language certificate and
        he submitted there may be delay in  obtaining  the  same  but  this
        submission fails to have regard  to  the  decision  in  R  (on  the
        application of Chapti) [2011] EWHC 3370 Admin in which  Mr  Justice
        Beatson considered the issue of English language test  requirements
        for spouses. He found that the aims  of  the  Rules  -  to  promote
        integration and to protect public services -  are  legitimate  aims
        within Article 8(2).  He concluded "taking  into  account  all  the
        material before the court, in particular the exceptions to it  (the
        rule), the new rule is not  a  disproportionate  interference  with
        family life  and  is  justified...the  fact  that  it  may,  in  an
        individual case, be possible to argue that  the  operation  of  the
        exceptions in the way envisaged in the evidence adduced  on  behalf
        of the Home Secretary is a disproportionate  infringement  of  that
        individual's   rights   does   not   render   the    rule    itself
        disproportionate".   At paragraph 115 of his decision he  indicated
        that "absent the circumstances of a particular case it follows that
        in the generality of cases, and subject to particular circumstances
        which can only be identified on a case by case basis", interference
        arising from a delay in entering the UK  whilst  a  certificate  is
        obtained is unlikely to lead to a breach of Article 8.   It is  not
        been proved on the evidence that circumstances do exist which  will
        mean any delay in obtaining the certificate will lead to  a  breach
        of article 8.


    56. The facts as  known  therefore  indicate  there  may  be  delay  in
        obtaining a language certificate and there may be  issues  relating
        to the availability of funds, but the lack of evidence specifically
        addressing these issues means  the  claim  the  Appellant  will  be
        unable  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  has  not  been
        substantiated.  It has not been proved that there are no  prospects
        of success.


    57. I have taken into account for the decision of the House of Lords in
        EB (Kosovo) (FC) v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41 in which  it  was  said  the
        Tribunal should "recognise that it will rarely be proportionate  to
        uphold an order for removal of a spouse if there  is  a  close  and
        genuine  bond  with  the  other  spouse  and  that  spouse   cannot
        reasonably be expected to follow the removed spouse to the  country
        of removal or if the effect of the order is to sever a genuine  and
        subsisting relationship between parent and  child".   The  evidence
        does  not  support  the  claim  the  Appellant's   husband   cannot
        follow/accompany her to Iraq whilst an application is made or  that
        the effect  of  such  action  would  be  to  sever  a  genuine  and
        subsisting relationship.


    58. As the claim it will be unreasonable in all the  circumstances  for
        the husband  returned  to  Iraq  has  not  been  substantiated  the
        exception to the Immigration Rules is not  satisfied.   The  appeal
        under the Immigration Rules is therefore dismissed.


    59. It is necessary when conducting a properly balanced proportionality
        exercise to consider the position of both parties and the weight to
        be attached to the legitimate aim of immigration control.       The
        onus lies upon the Respondent to show that the interference or lack
        of respect is "necessary in a democratic society" for  one  of  the
        stated interests.  As the Court of Appeal said at paragraph  12  of
        the determination in Chengjie Miao [2006] EWCA Civ 75. "To do  this
        the State must show not only that the proposed step is  lawful  but
        that it is sufficiently  important  to  justify  limiting  a  basic
        right; that it is sensibly directed to that objective; and that  it
        does not impair the right more than  is  necessary.   The  last  of
        these criteria commonly  requires  an  appraisal  of  the  relative
        importance of the State's objective and the impact of  the  measure
        on the individual.  When you have answered such questions you  have
        struck the balance".


    60. In Konstatinov v The Netherlands (Applic.  16351/03),  reported  in
        June 2007 and which post dated Huang and  Kashmiri  v  SSHD  [2007]
        UKHL 11, the European Court of Human rights  said  that  the  State
        enjoyed a margin of appreciation under Article 8.


    61. In FK and OK Botswana [2013] EWCA Civ 238 Sir Stanley Burnton  said
        that "The maintenance of immigration control is not an aim that  is
        implied for  the  purposes  of  article  8.2.  Its  maintenance  is
        necessary in order to preserve or to foster the economic well-being
        of the country, in order to protect health and morals, and for  the
        protection of the rights and freedoms of others. If there  were  no
        immigration control, enormous numbers of persons would be  able  to
        enter this country, and would be entitled to claim social  security
        benefits, the benefits of the National Health Service, to be housed
        (or to compete for housing with  those  in  this  country)  and  to
        compete for employment with  those  already  here.  Their  children
        would be entitled to be educated at  the  taxpayers'  expense...All
        such matters (and I do not suggest that they are the only  matters)
        go to the economic well-being of the country. That the  individuals
        concerned in the  present  case  are  law-abiding  (other  than  in
        respect of immigration controls) does not  detract  from  the  fact
        that the maintenance of a generally applicable  immigration  policy
        is, albeit indirectly, a legitimate aim for the purposes of article
        8".


    62. The parties were aware of the precarious nature of the  appellant's
        status when they acted as they did and created this family unit. In
        Hayat Elias LJ stated:


          51. In my judgment, these were all proper considerations to  weigh
   in the balance               when considering the merits of the Article 8
   claim.  As  the  Secretary  of  State               pointed  out  in  her
   submissions,    there    is    strong     Strasbourg     and     domestic
   authority to the effect that only in  exceptional  circumstances  will  a
   couple who              have formed a union  in  full  knowledge  of  the
   precarious immigration status of              either of them be  entitled
   to  remain   pursuant   to   Article   8   rights:   see   Y   v   Russia
   [2010] 51 EHRR 21 paragraph 104.


    63. Article 8 does not allow a person to choose  the  county  in  which
        they wish to live.


    64. I do not dismiss this appeal on a purely procedural point but as  a
        result of a proper consideration of the Article  8  proportionality
        issues. Having done so I find the  Respondent  has  discharged  the
        burden of proof upon her to show the decision is  proportionate  to
        the legitimate aim relied upon, especially on  the  facts  of  this
        case and the deliberate attempt by the Appellant and her family  to
        circumvent the formal requirements for entry clearance and attempts
        to prevent her subsequent removal.


Decision

    65. The First-tier Tribunal Judge has been  found  to  have  materially
        erred in law and his determination set aside. I remake the decision
        as follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    66. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


          I make no such an order (pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
   Procedure           (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008) as no  such  application
   was  made  and  no  basis  for         making  such  an  order  has  been
   established.
