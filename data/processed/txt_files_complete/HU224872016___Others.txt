                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Pollock Ross &
Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This decision is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's decision dated 14  September  2016,  declining  to
         grant the appellants leave to remain on  family  and  private  life
         grounds.

     ii) The appellants' grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge McGavin, promulgated on 9 February 2018.

     iv) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal filed on 21 February 2018.

      v) The grant of permission by FtT Judge Froom, dated 4 June 2018.

 2. Mr Matthews said that the judge's  approach  was  consistent  with  the
    judgement given by the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) &  Others  v  SHHD
    [2018] on 24 October 2018.  However,  he  said  that  the  decision  on
    proportionality in relation to the "qualifying children" did  not  have
    enough regard to the significant weight to be given to their length  of
    residence and the strength of reasons required not to grant leave.   He
    conceded that the decision should be set aside, but not that the appeal
    fell to be allowed, and submitted that the case should be  remitted  to
    another judge in the FtT.

 3. Mr Winter on behalf of the appellants was content with that outcome.

 4. I enquired whether the case might not be more apt for further  decision
    in the UT.  There is a presumption that the UT will proceed  to  remake
    decisions, of which parties are reminded in directions issued with  the
    grant of permission; and there is little dispute over the primary facts
    of this case.  However, both parties were of the view that considerable
    updating and, in effect, entire rehearing  of  the  evidence  would  be
    necessary.  That is an exercise most appropriate for the FtT.

 5. Under section 12 of the 2002 Act and Practice Statement 7.2 the case is
    remitted to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.   The  member(s)  of
    the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include Judge McGavin.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
