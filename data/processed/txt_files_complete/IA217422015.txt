 For the Appellant:    Mr M Goldborough, solicitor, UK Law Solicitors
 For the Respondent:   Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                        DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against the decision, promulgated on 2 October
       2015, of First-tier   Tribunal Judge Kanagaratnam (hereinafter
       referred to as the judge). Permission to appeal was granted by
       Designated Judge Zucker on 15 April 2016.




                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2016

 Background

    2. The appellant, aged 52, entered the  United  Kingdom  with  leave  to
       enter as a visitor on  17  August  2010.  Her  leave  expired  on  11
       February 2011. On 2 March 2015, the appellant sought leave to  remain
       in this country in order to care for her daughter and grandchildren.

    3. The respondent noted that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  all  the
       requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Rules. On considering whether
       there were any exceptional  circumstances,  the  Secretary  of  State
       concluded that the  appellant's  daughter  could  care  for  her  own
       children  with  the  support  of  social  services  if  required  and
       accordingly any  disruption  to  the  appellant's  private  life  was
       proportionate to the  legitimate  aim  of  maintaining  an  effective
       immigration control.

    4. In appealing, the appellant argued that  her  daughter  was  mentally
       affected by an attack upon her, which took place in 2010, which  left
       her unable to care for herself.


    5. The judge  considered  the  appeal  on  the  papers  before  him  and
       dismissed it both under and outside the Rules.

    6. The grounds of application  argue  that  the  judge  found  that  the
       suitability requirements of paragraph 276ADE had not  been  met  when
       this was not in issue; that he erred as to the age of  the  appellant
       in describing her as 25; the judge failed to provide reasons for  his
       findings; filed to assess the evidence before him and failed to  have
       regard to section 117B of the 2002 Act.

    7. Permission was granted on the basis that the judge put in issue  that
       which was  not  in  issue  and  provided  inadequate  and  incoherent
       reasons. Permission was  not  explicitly  refused  on  the  remaining
       grounds.

    8. The Secretary of State lodged a Rule 24 response on 8 April 2016,  in
       which the appellant's appeal was not opposed and a fresh oral hearing
       was sought. The Upper Tribunal was invited to issue  directions  that
       the appellant's representative file and serve a  consolidated  appeal
       bundle containing the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal and any
       updated evidence should the matter be retained in the Upper Tribunal.



The hearing

    6. At the hearing before me, both sides were, rightly, in agreement that
       the judge erred and that the matter ought to be remitted to the First-
       tier for a de novo hearing.








    7. In deciding whether the matter should be remitted to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal or retained at the Upper Tribunal, I took into consideration
       that there were ongoing Family Court proceedings involving one of the
       appellant's grandchildren. Those proceedings are due to consider  the
       question, among others, of whether the child in  question  should  be
       placed in  the  sole  or  joint  care  of  the  appellant.  In  these
       circumstances, I found that it was more appropriate for  this  appeal
       to be reheard in the First-tier.


Error of law

    8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to provide any reasons  for  his
       finding that the appellant did not meet the requirements of paragraph
       276ADE of the Rules. Once the paragraphs setting  out  case  law  are
       removed from the decision, the reasons provided  for  dismissing  the
       appellant's Article 8 case outside the Rules are minimal and fail  to
       engage with the evidence provided by the appellant. The remainder  of
       the decision is incoherent and  littered  with  factual  errors.  The
       decision cannot, therefore, stand.

      Conclusions

      The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

      I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

      No application for anonymity was made at the First-tier, however I  do
    so now given the change in the circumstances of the appellant's family:



        "Pursuant to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order.  Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellant. This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties. Any failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings. "



       Directions

    1. This matter is to be heard afresh by the First-tier Tribunal  (Hatton
       Cross) at an oral hearing before any judge except Judge Kanagaratnam.

    2. The matter is to be listed for a paper case management hearing  owing
       to the ongoing Family Court proceedings.



     Signed:     Date: 13 May 2016
