Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Siddall ("the judge"), promulgated on 12 February  2019,
    in which she dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's
    decision of 23 May  2017,  refusing  to  issue  him  with  a  permanent
    residence  card  under  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2016 ("the Regulations").

 2. The Appellant had entered the United Kingdom in September  2010.  On  8
    December 2011 he married [KK] ("KK"), a Hungarian national. The  couple
    separated in 2015 and a divorce petition was  lodged  in  May  of  that
    year. The marriage was terminated on 7 September  2016.  The  Appellant
    applied for a permanent residence card on 6 December 2016.



The judge's decision

 3. The judge correctly directed herself to the  applicable  provisions  of
    the Regulations, those being 6(2), 6(6), 10(5),  10(6),  15(1)(f),  and
    18(2). In respect of Regulation  10  (5)(a),  the  judge  made  express
    reference to the Court of Appeal's judgment in Baigazieva  [2018]  EWCA
    Civ 1088, in which the Respondent had conceded that the  relevant  date
    for an applicant to show that the former EEA spouse had been exercising
    Treaty rights was that at which divorce proceedings were initiated.

 4. On the evidence before her, at paras. 16-17 the judge  found  that  the
    Appellant satisfied the requirements  of  Regulations  10(5)(d)(i)  and
    10(6). The core issue in the appeal was  whether  the  Appellant  could
    show that KK had been exercising Treaty rights as at the initiation  of
    the divorce proceedings in May 2015.

 5. Following a previous direction issued by the First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    Respondent had obtained evidence from  HMRC  relating  to  KK's  income
    details for the years 2011-2017.  Having  recognised  the  difficulties
    faced by the former spouses of EEA  nationals  in  cases  such  as  the
    present,  the  judge  concluded  that  the  evidence  as  a  whole,  in
    particular that emanating from HMRC, was not sufficient to show that KK
    had in fact been exercising Treaty rights in any  capacity  as  at  the
    relevant point in time.  She  found  that  the  evidence  of  any  work
    undertaken by KK had been "absolutely minimal" and that it was unlikely
    that she had been a jobseeker.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. There are two sets of grounds before us. The first were prepared by the
    Appellant's solicitors for the application  for  permission  to  appeal
    made to the First-tier Tribunal. In essence they assert that the  judge
    failed to look at the evidence of KK's work holistically and failed  to
    explain why even minimal work was not sufficient for her to have been a
    qualified person.

 7. The second set of grounds were drafted by Counsel (not Mr Allison)  and
    was submitted with the renewed application made to the Upper  Tribunal.
    For the purposes of the appeal before us, the two  relevant  additional
    grounds are 1 and 4. The first asserts that the judge failed to address
    the evidence of self-employment correctly  and  erroneously  imposed  a
    need to show profit in respect of such work in considering Regulation 6
    of the Regulations. The second ground states that the  judge  erred  in
    not requiring the Respondent to obtain further evidence in relation  to
    KK's circumstances before determining the appellant's appeal.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Black
    on 23 May 2019.



The hearing before us

 9. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Allison confirmed  that  he  was  only
    seeking to rely on  the  first  of  the  original  grounds  of  appeal,
    together with the first  and  fourth  of  the  additional  grounds.  He
    submitted that the period of self-employment ran from April 2015  until
    November of that year, not through to April  2016.  At  para.  25,  the
    judge had been wrong to have considered a two-year  period  from  April
    2014 to April 2016 in respect of any efforts made by KK to  find  work.
    In fact, the period was shorter: April  2014  to  May  2015,  when  the
    divorce proceedings were initiated.

10. As to the information from HMRC obtained by way of  a  so-called  "Amos
    direction" (see Amos [2011]  Immigration  AR  600),  Mr  Allison  quite
    candidly acknowledged that  the  Appellant's  representatives  had  not
    asked the First-tier Tribunal for a further direction  in  relation  to
    any evidence obtainable  from  the  Department  of  Work  and  Pensions
    ("DWP"), nor had there been  any  application  to  adjourn  the  appeal
    before the judge on this basis.

11. Ms Isherwood emphasised the fact that the burden of proof lay with  the
    Appellant. It had been open to the judge to find that she did in  light
    of the evidence before her.

12. In reply, Mr Allison submitted that the judge had not  expressly  found
    that KK's work had not been genuine and effective: �240  PAYE  earnings
    in the tax year 2014/2015 were not, he submitted, simply  marginal  and
    ancillary.



Decision on error of law

13. As we announced the parties at the hearing, we conclude that there  are
    no material errors of law in the judge's decision. Our reasons for this
    are as follows.

14. The judge clearly directed herself properly as to the  law  in  general
    and in respect of the core issue of Regulation 10(5)(a) in  particular.
    Importantly, she quite rightly recognised  that  the  burden  of  proof
    rested throughout with the Appellant, notwithstanding the  acknowledged
    difficulties that can arise in cases such as the present.

15. It is appropriate to deal with the last  of  Mr  Allison's  grounds  of
    challenge first. It is clear to us that the judge was not  in  any  way
    obliged to have issued a further direction to the  Respondent  relating
    to information held by the DWP and/or to have adjourned the  appeal  of
    his own volition. The HMRC evidence had been in the possession  of  the
    Appellant's representatives since August 2018 and it is clear from  the
    face of that evidence that details of any benefits claimed by KK  might
    have been obtained  from  the  DWP.  As  Mr  Allison  acknowledged,  no
    application was made to the First-tier Tribunal for a further direction
    between August 2018 and the hearing before the judge  in  late  January
    2019. No such application was made on the day of the hearing,  nor  was
    an adjournment  sought.  There  had  been  ample  opportunity  for  the
    Appellant's  representatives  to  have  sought  further  evidence.   No
    criticism can be laid at the door of the judge.

16. We add for the sake of completeness that the Respondent was  not  under
    an ongoing obligation to obtain, in the absence of any request  by  the
    Appellant or a direction from  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  yet  further
    evidence on KK's circumstances from a different source.

17. In light of the above, the judge  was  fully  entitled  to  proceed  to
    decide the appeal in light of the evidence before her.

18. We turn now to the other grounds of challenge. It is clear  from  para.
    23 that the judge had the provisions of Regulation 6 well in  mind.  It
    is also clear from para. 24 that the judge  had  considered  the  whole
    period covered by the HMRC evidence when assessing KK's  circumstances,
    contrary to what is said in para. 7.2 of the original  grounds.  Having
    said that, the judge was clearly entitled to direct her main  focus  on
    the point in time at which the divorce proceedings were  initiated.  In
    so doing, she was entitled to conclude that the evidence of  work  done
    by KK in the period  surrounding  the  relevant  date  was  "absolutely
    minimal" (showing earnings of �240  for  employment  in  the  tax  year
    2014/2015  and  �40  for  self-employment  the  following  year,  which
    included the month in which the divorce  proceedings  were  initiated).
    The fact that the accounting period for  self-employment  ended  on  21
    November 2015 makes no difference to this whatsoever. That end date  in
    no way "proved  self-employment",  as  alleged  in  the  first  of  the
    original grounds of appeal.

19. Whilst Mr Allison submitted that the judge did not expressly find  that
    KK's work had not been genuine  or  effective,  the  earnings  were  so
    extremely low that when placed in the context of the judge's assessment
    as a whole, the only rational inference to be drawn  is  that  she  was
    indeed concluding that the work was neither genuine nor effective,  and
    was quite obviously only marginal in its nature. Our view  on  this  is
    reinforced by the fact that the Appellant's counsel deemed it necessary
    to rely on the argument that KK had been a jobseeker  at  the  relevant
    time: there was clearly a recognition that reliance on  the  negligible
    earnings was not going to be sufficient to show that KK was a qualified
    person.

20. In respect of the period during which the judge  found  that  KK  would
    have had to be searching for work, it is right that in para. 25 of  her
    decision, the judge refers to April 2014  to  April  2016,  whilst  the
    divorce proceedings were initiated in May 2015. There is no error here,
    or at least not one that can properly be  described  as  material.  The
    evidence before the judge for the period between  May  2015  and  April
    2016 showed no earnings at all from employment after April 2015 and, as
    set out above, a negligible income from self-employment  between  April
    2015 and November of that year. There were  no  earnings  at  all  from
    either employment or self-employment  for  any  subsequent  period.  In
    light of this, the judge was fully entitled to  conclude  that  on  the
    evidence as a whole, the Appellant was unable to show that KK had  been
    either a worker who had retained  that  status  or  a  jobseeker  under
    Regulation 6 of the Regulations.

21. Mr Allison, quite rightly in our view, did not pursue ground 3  of  the
    additional grounds. In any event, on the  evidence  before  the  judge,
    such as it was, she was clearly entitled to conclude that the Appellant
    had failed to show that KK had been in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance
    at the material time.

22. Whilst we have a degree of sympathy for his situation, in  the  absence
    of any material errors, the Appellant's appeal must fail.

23. We record here that at the conclusion  of  the  hearing,  Ms  Isherwood
    provided Mr Allison with information she  had  obtained  from  the  DWP
    regarding KK's previous benefits claims. We of course were not privy to
    the contents of this information.



Anonymity

24. We do not make an anonymity order in this case.
