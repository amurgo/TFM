Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms H Head of Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant in this appeal is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
   Department and the respondent is a citizen of citizen of Afghanistan born
   on 20 September 1994.  However, for convenience, I refer below to  SS  as
   "the appellant" and to the Secretary of State as "the respondent",  which
   are the designations they had before the First-tier Tribunal.

2. The Secretary of State appeals with  permission  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
   against  the  determination  of  First-tier   Tribunal   Judge   McDonald
   promulgated on 25 September 2015, allowing the appellant's appeal against
   the decision of the respondent made  on  17  March  2015,  in  which  the
   respondent refused the appellant's  claim  for  asylum  and  humanitarian
   protection in the United Kingdom.

3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Astle in granting permission to  appeal  stated
   that the grounds  are  arguable  in  that  the  judge  made  inconsistent
   findings regarding the appellant's contact with his family in Afghanistan
   and  failed  to  consider  that  the  appellant  would  be  returned   to
   Afghanistan with his adult brother and not alone.

4. Thus the appeal came before me

    The First-tier Tribunal's findings

5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge made the following  findings  which  I  set
   out in summary. The appellant's case  is  that  he  arrived  at  Heathrow
   airport on 22 February 2013 with a false passport issued by an agent when
   he was almost 13 years old. He is now in the care of the  London  Borough
   of Hillingdon Social Services and lives with his foster parents. He  does
   not live with his brother who is also in the United Kingdom.

6. The appellant's case at its highest and without taking into  account  the
   challenges made by the respondent, is that his father was a member of the
   Taliban and was killed in 2005, when he was about five or six  years  old
   which is. Following his father's death, he was bullied on one occasion at
   school, as a result of his father's involvement with the Taliban. Shortly
   before the appellant's departed from the  United  Kingdom  in  2013,  his
   mother was approached by the Taliban seeking to recruit the appellant  as
   a child soldier or suicide bomber.

7. The appellant states  that  he  has  lost  contact  with  his  family  in
   Afghanistan. The Secretary of State does not accept that the  appellant's
   father is dead, that there was Taliban involvement and that the appellant
   has lost contact with his family. The appellant's brother, JS has had two
   appeals heard before the First-tier Tribunal. On 7 April 2011  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Khan rejected the appellant's brother's claim that he  was
   an orphan. He equally rejected  that  the  location  of  the  appellant's
   family was unknown. He also rejected that their father  had  died.  Judge
   Khan dismissed the appellant's brother's claim for asylum. On 2  December
   2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge  Higgins  also  rejected  the  appellant's
   brother's claim for asylum, specifically he rejected the contentions made
   by the appellant, (who was a witness at  his  brother's  trial)  and  his
   brother at that hearing that the two of them were  not  in  contact  with
   their family.

8. So far as the appeal is under the  Immigration  Rules  is  concerned  the
   Judge allowed the appeal. There is no doubt  that  the  appellant  was  a
   minor when he arrived in the United Kingdom and  was  a  minor  with  the
   respondent's decision was made. There is no evidence within the  decision
   that the Secretary of State has considered the  Immigration  Rules  which
   commence at paragraph 350 adding particular rules 352ZC, 352ZD and 352ZE.
   I find that the appellant was an unaccompanied asylum seeking child under
   the age of 17� when he arrived at Heathrow. The appellant has applied for
   asylum and has been refused refugee leave  and  humanitarian  protection.
   There is no evidence to show  that  adequate  reception  arrangements  in
   Afghanistan exist to which the appellant would be returned if  leave  was
   not granted. The appellant  is  separated  from  both  his  parents.  The
   appellant's brother may be an adult but he does not have  in  law  or  by
   custom the responsibility to care for his brother. His brother is  stated
   to be born on 20 September 1994 and would have been 18 when the appellant
   arrived at Heathrow. The appellant is in the care of the  London  Borough
   of Hillingdon and living with foster parents and  his  brother  does  not
   have responsibility for him. I find that leave should  be  granted  under
   paragraph 352ZE until the appellant is 17�  years  old.  It  is  for  the
   appellant to satisfy me that he has an Article 8 private and/or family in
   this country which will be interfered with by the decision under appeal.

9. As for the claim for asylum and humanitarian  protection  are  concerned,
   the Judge dismissed those claims for the following reasons. He stated, "I
   am not persuaded that the appellant's father died  in  the  circumstances
   claimed. There are a  number  of  inconsistencies  concerning  this.  The
   matter has been already considered twice before Tribunal Judge  Khan  and
   Tribunal Judge Higgins. Although those appeals concerned the  appellant's
   brother, this appellant gave evidence before Judge Higgins. The fact  was
   substantially the same. I do  not  accept  that  the  appellant  and  his
   brother have lost contact  with  their  family.  Like  the  two  previous
   Tribunal Judges I do not find it plausible that the appellant would leave
   Afghanistan without some means of keeping in touch. The evidence given by
   this  appellant  before  Tribunal  Judge  Higgins,  would  appear  to  be
   inconsistent with what is being said by him before me. In particular, the
   appellant had his brother's telephone number when he arrived at Heathrow.
   The appellant said in evidence that his mother had a  mobile  phone  that
   was given to her the  day  before  the  appellant  left  for  the  United
   Kingdom. The appellant said that his mother did not have a SIM  card  for
   the phone. I find that implausible.  The  most  likely  reason  that  the
   mother was given the phone was  to  keep  in  touch  with  her  son.  The
   appellant's brother's telephone number was not known to the family before
   the appellant left for the United Kingdom as the appellant took  it  with
   him. His brother is therefore capable of being contacted  either  by  his
   mother or his uncle. In any event,  the  two  other  witnesses  who  gave
   evidence in addition to the appellant's brother from the same village all
   have mobile phones and clearly have the ability to  keep  in  touch  with
   each other. I do not find it  plausible  that  the  appellant  would  not
   contact his mother in Afghanistan either directly or indirectly or  other
   village members or his uncle. The  appellant  has  a  maternal  uncle  in
   Afghanistan with whom contact can be made".

10. The appellant refers to a  visit  that  his  mother  received  from  the
   Taliban seeking to recruit the appellant as a soldier or suicide  bomber.
   The exact date of that visit is challenged, however, as  the  answers  to
   questions 79 to 84 of the Asylum interview show  the  appellant  and  his
   mother's response to that visit was to relocate to Jalalabad  where  they
   did not have any further problems with the Taliban. This shows  that  the
   appellant was able to relocate within Afghanistan and even if  he  had  a
   well-founded fear of persecution, which I do not accept,  paragraph  339O
   of the Immigration Rules would apply. The appellant does not have a well-
   founded fear of persecution and his asylum appeal is dismissed.

11. As for humanitarian protection since I have  allowed  the  appeal  under
   the Immigration Rules I do not consider that it is necessary  for  me  to
   decide this issue since it will not arise unless or until  the  appellant
   is required to return to Afghanistan. This may  occur  when,  or  if,  he
   makes a further application for leave to remain following the  expiry  of
   his leave to remain at the age of 17 and of and it should  be  considered
   at that time in the light of the appellant's personal  circumstances  and
   the situation in Afghanistan which then exist. As far  as  Article  8  is
   concerned this is  also  an  aspect  that  would  be  considered  if  the
   appellant's leave when he attains the age of 17� is not  extended  and  a
   further application for leave to remain is made.

12. The decision is that the appeal is allowed under the  Immigration  Rules
   but is dismissed on asylum grounds and  humanitarian  protection  grounds
   and on human rights grounds.

    The respondent's grounds of appeal

13. The respondent's grounds of appeal state the following.  The  Judge  has
   allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules but dismissed  the  appeal
   on asylum, humanitarian protection and  human  rights  grounds.  For  the
   avoidance of doubt the respondent is seeking only to appeal the  decision
   to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

14. The Judge has made inconsistent findings in respect of  the  appellant's
   contact with his family and has materially misdirected himself in law  by
   failing to consider that the appellant would be returned with  his  adult
   brother.

15. At paragraph 66, the Judge finds that the appellant  is  separated  from
   his parents. However, at paragraph 84, the Judge finds that the appellant
   is in contact with his mother in Afghanistan. Whilst the appellant may be
   physically separated from his mother, the Judge has  failed  to  consider
   the two findings that the appellant is in  contact  with  his  family  in
   Afghanistan. Therefore, the appellant is clearly not  isolated  from  his
   family and their whereabouts are clearly known to him.

16. The fact that the appellant does not currently reside with  his  brother
   could not lead to a finding that the appellant would  be  "unaccompanied"
   on his return to Afghanistan. As was clearly  evident  from  the  refusal
   letter, the  appellant's  older  brother  had  been  given  a  period  of
   discretionary leave  whilst  the  appellant's  appeal  was  ongoing.  The
   appellant's brother gave evidence at  the  appeal  and  there  was  clear
   evidence of regular contact  between  the  brothers.  By  definition  the
   appellant is not and would not be an unaccompanied asylum  seeker  as  he
   would be returning to Afghanistan with his brother, who is an adult,  and
   would be returning to Afghanistan to reside with this mother  and  uncle,
   who the Judge found at paragraph 82-85 that the  appellant  is  still  in
   contact with.







    The appellant's response to the respondent's grounds of appeal

17. The respondent's actions in relation to the appellant's case  have  been
   legally flawed  and  unfair.  Having  accepted  the  appellant's  age  in
   February 2013, the respondent failed to grant the appellant discretionary
   leave as required by law. The respondent  further  delayed  in  making  a
   decision for another 15 months and then continued to refuse to grant this
   child appellant appropriate leave. At the appellant's appeal on  30  June
   2014, the  respondent  withdrew  her  decision  after  considering  their
   failure to grant discretionary leave. Perversely,  the  respondent  again
   failed to grant discretionary leave and continued to delay for a  further
   nine months before refusing the appellants again in an identical  Reasons
   for Refusal Letter. The appellant's appeal was allowed by Judge  McDonald
   on account of the respondent's failure to grant discretionary leave.

18. The determination of  Judge  McDonald  does  not  contain  any  material
   errors of law. The Judge clearly applied the law correctly and it is  the
   respondent that did not. Despite the appellant's minority, the respondent
   failed to grant him discretionary leave in accordance with her own policy
   in relation to unaccompanied asylum seeking children  and  in  accordance
   with paragraph 352ZC of the Immigration Rules.

19. The respondent further failed to act in  accordance  with  the  law  and
   failed to take seriously her duty under s55. The respondent relies on one
   point in submitting that the Judge  misdirected  himself  by  incorrectly
   finding that  the  appellant  is  an  unaccompanied  asylum  seeker.  The
   respondent asserts that the appellant would be returned with his brother.
   The respondent's grounds  are  clearly  without  merit.  The  appellant's
   brother at the date of the hearing had leave  to  remain  in  the  United
   Kingdom and therefore was not returnable. In  any  event  the  respondent
   knows  the  definition  of  an  unaccompanied  asylum  seeking  child  is
   confirmed as being "a person who is under 18 years of age when the asylum
   application is submitted; is applying for asylum in their own right;  and
   is separated from both parents and is not being cared for by an adult who
   in law by custom has responsibility to do so". At paragraph 66 the  Judge
   found that  the  appellant  is  separated  from  both  his  parents.  The
   appellant's brother may be an adult but he does not have in law or custom
   the responsibility to care for his brother... The  appellant  is  in  the
   care of the London Borough of Hillingdon and living with foster  parents.
   His brother does not have responsibility for him.

20. Paragraph 352ZE of the Immigration Rules confirms  that  "limited  leave
   to remain should be granted to an unaccompanied asylum seeking child  for
   a period of 30 months (or until the child is 17� years of  age  whichever
   is shorter,) provided specified requirements are met."  The  requirements
   are that the applicant is an unaccompanied asylum seeking child is  under
   the age of 17� years throughout the duration of leave to  be  granted  in
   this capacity; the applicant  must  have  applied  for  asylum  and  been
   refused refugee leave and humanitarian protection; there are no  adequate
   reception arrangements in the country to which they would be returned  if
   leave to remain was not granted;

21. The appellant was clearly entitled to a grant of discretionary leave  in
   accordance with the Immigration Rules. The respondent's  bizarre  attempt
   to offload their statutory duty to this child by suggesting that he would
   be returned with his brother is entirely unsustainable.  The  appellant's
   brother has a current outstanding application with the  Home  Office  and
   therefore the Home Office cannot remove him with the appellant.

    The hearing

22. I heard submissions from both parties as to whether there  is  an  error
   of law in the determination of the first-tier Tribunal Judge.  Mr  Clarke
   on behalf of the respondent submitted that the Judge's finding that there
   are no reception facilities in Afghanistan  is  inconsistent  with  other
   findings that the appellant's mother and uncle are living in Afghanistan.
   The Robinson obvious point which is not the grounds  of  appeal  is  that
   first-tier Tribunal Judge  Khan  in  his  determination  the  appellant's
   brother's appeal in 2011 found that he was in contact  with  his  mother.
   The appellant therefore will  not  be  an  unaccompanied  asylum  seeking
   child. The appellant's brother who is an adult has responsibility for the
   appellant by custom. The public policy guidance states that unaccompanied
   children are united other family members. It is no requirement  that  the
   appellant must have lived with his brother for him to have responsibility
   to travel with him Afghanistan.

23. Miss Heather on behalf of the appellant relied on in her  reply  to  the
   grounds of appeal. She said that the appellant's brother  has  a  pending
   appeal and therefore is not movable from this country. The appellant does
   not live with his  brother  and  therefore  the  brother  does  not  have
   responsibility for the appellant. The appellant's brother's leave expired
   in March 2015 and he has made  a  further  application.  I  must  make  a
   finding that the appellant is an unaccompanied minor at this time as  his
   brother cannot be removed with him.

24. Mr Clarke replied that the Reasons for Refusal letter  deals  with  this
   point about the appellant's brother leave to remain.  The  appellant  and
   his brother's applications are linked and therefore  the  appellant  will
   only be removed when his brother is removed. All Mr Clarke suggested that
   the appellant be granted leave to coincide with that of his brother.

    Findings as to whether there is an error of law

25. The Judge fell into material error of law in the determination  when  he
   made inconsistent findings as to the main issue in this appeal  which  is
   whether the appellant  is  in  contact  with  his  mother  and  uncle  in
   Afghanistan. At the beginning of the determination the Judge  found  that
   the appellant satisfies the Immigration Rules because he was a minor when
   he entered the United Kingdom and was  an  unaccompanied  asylum  seeking
   child under the age of 17�. He stated "there is no evidence to show  that
   adequate  reception  arrangements  in  Afghanistan  exist  to  which  the
   appellant would be returned if leave was not granted".  The  Judge  found
   that the appellant is  separated  from  both  his  parents.  However,  at
   paragraph 82 the Judge found "further, I do not accept that the appellant
   and his brother have  lost  contact  with  their  family.  Like  the  two
   previous Tribunal Judges, I do not find it plausible that  the  appellant
   would leave Afghanistan without some  means  of  keeping  in  touch."  At
   paragraph 83 the Judge states that the appellant was inconsistent  before
   Judge Higgins with the evidence that he gave before him at  the  hearing.
   At paragraph 84 the Judge found that the appellant's mother was  given  a
   mobile phone to keep in contact with the appellant. He  also  found  that
   the appellant has an uncle who is contactable in Afghanistan.

26. Whether or not the appellant is in contact with his mother and uncle  in
   Afghanistan, was pivotal to the appellant's success  or  failure  in  the
   appeal pursuant to the Immigration Rules. Three different Tribunal Judges
   have  found  that  the  appellant's  mother  and  uncle  are  living   in
   Afghanistan and the appellant and his brother (whose  appeal  for  asylum
   and humanitarian protection has  also  been  dismissed  on  two  separate
   occasions) are in contact with them. The  Judge  having  found  that  the
   appellant's mother and uncle can be contacted in Afghanistan,  materially
   erred in law in allowing the appeal pursuant to the Immigration Rules.

27. Furthermore, the Judge  found  that  the  appellant's  account  was  not
   credible and did not accept that he is at  risk  from  the  Taliban.  The
   Judge also found that even if he was, when the mother relocated  with  it
   Afghanistan, she  had  no  further  problem  from  the  Taliban  and  the
   appellant could have relocated with her. This should have demonstrated to
   the Judge that the appellant has been sent to this country by his  mother
   and uncle as an economic refugee and he was not fleeing from  persecution
   in Afghanistan. A parent who has sent the appellant to the United Kingdom
   would be aware that there is every chance that they  may  fail  in  their
   plan of sending their child to the United Kingdom as an economic  refugee
   and if not find credible, he will be returned to  his  home  country  and
   ultimately to them.

28. This insistence on discretionary leave to the appellant until he is  17�
   years old is just that, it is discretionary and not mandatory. It is only
   to be given  where  there  are  no  reception  facilities  on  return  to
   Afghanistan for the minor child and who are not  in  contact  with  their
   parents. In this appeal, the appellant's mother and uncle have  sent  the
   appellant to the United Kingdom for economic reasons  and  no  doubt  are
   following his progress through  the  system.  The  appellant's  brother's
   asylum and humanitarian claim has also been  dismissed  in  two  separate
   appeals by two different Judges. Therefore, Three  Tribunal  Judges  have
   now found that the appellant's mother and uncle are  in  Afghanistan  who
   are in contact with the appellant and who will take  over  responsibility
   for him on his return.

29. It is clear that the respondent intends to  remove  the  appellant  with
   his brother who is an adult. Their  appeals  had  been  linked  for  that
   purpose. I find that the  appellant's  brother  is  responsible  for  the
   appellant by custom even though he may not  live  with  his  brother  and
   lives with foster parents. Therefore, there can be no possible reason for
   why the appellant should not be removed to Afghanistan with  his  brother
   who is an adult. The appellant has his mother and uncle in Afghanistan on
   his return who will meet them and therefore  he  will  be  reunited  with
   them. Therefore, the appellant  would  not  be  an  unaccompanied  asylum
   seeker but would be returned with  his  adult  brother  where  there  are
   adequate reception arrangements for him.

30. Consequential to my finding that there is a material  error  of  law  in
   the determination, I set aside the determination  of  Judge  McDonald  in
   respect of the Immigration  Rules.  There  was  no  cross-appeal  by  the
   appellant in respect of his asylum and humanitarian protection claim.

31. I re-make the decision. I find that the appellant has not  been  granted
   refugee status on humanitarian protection in this country.  I  find  that
   there  are  adequate  reception  arrangements  in  Afghanistan  for   the
   appellant. I find that the appellant will be returned at the same time as
   his brother who is an adult and is responsible for him by  custom.  There
   was no cultural evidence before me to say that brothers in Afghanistan do
   not have responsibility for each other by custom. On the contrary, I find
   that the culture from which the appellant comes has a very  close  family
   network. I find that the appellant does not meet the requirements of  the
   Immigration Rules and the respondent's decision is properly made.

    Decision

    I find that there is an error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination and I re- make the decision and dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal.
