                               PARESH KANUBHAI KADIA

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                                  DECISION

 1. The appellant applied to the Upper Tribunal for  permission  to  appeal
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal.

 2. On 14 July 2014 the appellant wrote to the Upper  Tribunal  withdrawing
    his appeal. That letter was not linked to the file until today, 23 July
    2014.

 3. On 22 July 2014 Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman considered the  permission
    application. He dismissed it.

 4. It remains the case that he did so without the  appellant's  withdrawal
    application having been put before him. It appears to me that I  should
    set aside the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge  Freeman  in  line  with
    Rule 43(2) (d) as there has been a procedural irregularity and in  line
    with paragraph 43 (1) (a) as it is in the interests of  justice  to  do
    so.

 5. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is withdrawn in line with Rule 17.

 6. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Khan promulgated  on  3  June  2014
    dismissing the appeal stands.
