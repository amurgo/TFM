For the Respondent: Mrs V James instructed by Braitch Solicitors

                                   DECISION


     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a  decision  of
        First-tier Tribunal Judge J S Law promulgated on the  7th  November
        2014 in  which  the  Judge  allowed  the  appeals  under  both  the
        Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR.
     2. The appellants, born 5th May 1974 and 17th May  1996  respectively,
        applied for entry clearance as  the  partner  and  child  of  their
        sponsor under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.  The  refusals
        are dated 24th January 2014. In relation to Mrs Kaur, it  was  said
        the evidence provided with the application failed to establish that
        the relationship with her sponsor was  genuine  and  subsisting  or
        that they intended to live together permanently in the  UK  leading
        to a refusal under paragraph  EC-P.1.1(d)  (E-ECP.2.6  &  2.10)  of
        Appendix FM. The failure to provide  all  the  specified  documents
        relating to her sponsors income led to a refusal under paragraph EC-
        P.1.1(d) (E-ECP.3.1) The application of Gandeep Singh  was  refused
        as the information provided with the application was  said  not  to
        prove the relationship with the sponsor or the fact  Gandeep  Singh
        was under the age of 18, EC-C.1.1(d) (E-ECC.1.2),  the  application
        of his mother had been refused  leading  to  a  refusal  under  EC-
        C.1.1(d) of Appendix  FM  (E-ECC.1.6),  and  by  reference  to  the
        financial aspects referred to above in relation   to  his  mother's
        application.
     3. Judge Law considered the evidence made available and  set  out  the
        findings and reasons at paragraphs 15 -  25  of  the  decision.  In
        relation to the appeal under the Immigration Rules the judge  found
        the relationship between the second appellant and sponsor proved by
        DNA evidence, which is not contested by the Entry Clearance Officer
        (ECO). The judge also accepted that the first appellant and sponsor
        were married and that although there was  no  explanation  for  the
        failure to provide details of contact between the parties, the same
        was accepted. In relation to the financial aspects of the Rules  it
        was found:


              16. The Respondent had rejected the Appellants' clams on  the
                  basis  that  they  did  not  comply  with  the   financial
                  requirements set down in the Immigration Rules.   This  is
                  regrettably  correct  as  whilst  at  the  time   of   the
                  application the Appellant had been working but now because
                  of ill-health this was no longer the case. The  Respondent
                  submitted  that  there  was  inadequate  details  of   his
                  employment prior to  the  application  and  this  must  be
                  accepted.  It is to be noted that the wage slips  for  the
                  six months had been provided post decision and I  do  give
                  some weight to the same even though it  should  have  been
                  necessary for the wage slips to be made available  at  the
                  date of decision.
              17. In looking at the refusal at the  date  of  decision  the
                  Appellant has not been fully  open  with  the  information
                  that they  provided  and  therefore  the  refusal  was  in
                  accordance with the Immigration Rules.
              18. I have found that there  had  been  major  non-compliance
                  with the Immigration Rules which would have prevented  the
                  Appellants entry. If I am wrong in that  respect  I  still
                  have to  consider  the  matter  under  Article  8  of  the
                  European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).......


     4. The clear indication from the above text is that  the  judge  found
        the decision to refuse under the  Immigration  Rules  was  lawfully
        correct yet in paragraph 23 the judge states that the appeals under
        the Immigration Rules are allowed.
     5. We have considered the decision as a  whole  to  ascertain  whether
        sufficient reasons have been given to support such a conclusion and
        reconcile the apparent contradictory findings.
     6. In relation to the maintenance requirements of Appendix FM, in R(on
        the application of MM (Lebanon), AM (Pakistan) &  SJ  (Pakistan)  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ  985  it
        was found that the statutory  presumptions  in  the  new  paragraph
        117B(3) of the 2002 Act, inserted by s.19 of  the  Immigration  Act
        2014 with effect from 28 July 2014, effectively closes the door  on
        any argument either within or without the Rules that  figures  less
        than those set out in the Rules are acceptable.
     7. The requirement is for an applicant  to  demonstrate  they  have  a
        gross income of at least �18,600 per annum or if applying with  one
        child �22,400 and an additional �2,400 for each  additional  child.
        Proof of the availability of such income is proved by the provision
        of 'specified documents' details of which are set out  at  Appendix
        FM-SE.  It  is  accepted  some  evidence  was  provided  but   that
        specifically noted as missing by the ECO was the two  payslips  and
        bank statements from the sponsor to cover the months of October and
        November 2013. This is relevant as the appellants were required  to
        provide pay slips for a period of six months prior to the  date  of
        application. The judge accepts these were not provided  but  claims
        six months payslips post decision were. These  cannot  satisfy  the
        requirements of the Rules. It is also noted  at  page  129  of  the
        bundle that the sponsor was issued with a P45 by All UK Express LTD
        dated 4th December 2013  and  recording  a  date  of  leaving  that
        employment on 30th November 2013. This also shows  a  tax  code  of
        944L which must have been allocated  to  the  sponsor  whereas  the
        payslips provided show an emergency code  of  BR,  including  those
        issued on the date the sponsor appears to have  finished  work  and
        immediately thereafter. These differences  undermine  the  evidence
        used to support the application but the judge does  not  appear  to
        have considered them.
     8. Other financial documents were provided  for  the  purpose  of  the
        appeal hearing at  pages  41-98  of  the  appellants'  bundle.  The
        sponsors Lloyds Bank statements are to be found at pages 41-56  and
        his wage slips at pages 57-60, pre decision, and post  decision  at
        pages 122-128.  In  relation  to  the  missing  documents,  a  bank
        statement dated 22nd October 2013 is to be found  at  page  56  but
        none for November 2013 at the above page  references  although  the
        same does appear at page 131.  The November bank statement shows  a
        change in income pattern and an undated letter  from  the  sponsors
        employer claims he was paid his November  sick  pay  cash  in  hand
        although his wages were being accepted through his  bank  now,  but
        for the second business run by  the  same  employer,  that  he  had
        received cash in hand for November, December and January  2014  and
        that this process would remain until any further changes were made.
        It has not been shown that the cash sums were paid in or identified
        in the statements as having been deposited as required by  Appendix
        FM-SE. The claim to have been paid sick pay for November and beyond
        contradicts the P45 indicating the sponsor's employment  terminated
        in November 2013.
     9. Statements of Fitness to Work For Social Security or Statutory Sick
        Pay dated 21st October 2013, 6th February 2014  and  6th  May  2014
        have been provided in the bundle at pages 119 -212. There is a lack
        of clarity in relation to the sponsor's situation as the Fitness to
        Work Certificates declare him unfit to  work  as  he  is  receiving
        dialysis yet he claims such employment continued.
    10. There is a clear contradiction in the determination in relation  to
        the ability of the appellant to satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
        Immigration Rules. The finding that the ECO's decision  is  correct
        and lawful appears to be supported by the evidence made  available.
        The conclusion in the alternative is not  explained  or  adequately
        reasoned which we find to be legal error.  Whether  that  error  is
        material depends upon whether the findings made  by  the  judge  in
        relation to Article 8 ECHR are sustainable.
    11. The judge considered the Razgar questions and found the  issue  was
        that of the proportionality of the decision.  It is  clear  from  a
        reading of Mrs James' written  submissions  and  skeleton  argument
        that the medical situation of the sponsor was the core matter  upon
        which she relied in her attempts to persuade the judge the decision
        was not proportionate.  Whilst  the  sponsors  need  for  a  kidney
        transplant is accepted, mere sympathy is  not  a  good  reason  for
        allowing an appeal on Article  8  grounds  -  see  MG  (Serbia  and
        Montenegro) [2005] UKAIT 00113 in which the  tribunal  stated  that
        sympathy for an individual did not enhance a person's rights  under
        Article 8.
    12. The judge noted the medical evidence made available which is to  be
        found at paragraphs 157-217 of the appeal bundle. At page 193 is  a
        letter from The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust dated 17th April 2014
        to the sponsors GP following a meeting with the sponsor to  discuss
        overseas live donations and the fact blood compatibility and tissue
        typing could be undertaken abroad and the results forwarded to  the
        hospital in Wolverhampton for review. Other correspondence has been
        included referring to further visits and an issue of  the  sponsors
        non-compliance with recommended medication which appears not to  be
        assisting his situation. The submission made by  Mr  Smart  to  the
        Upper Tribunal that  there  is  nothing  in  the  medical  evidence
        stating it is essential for his wife and son  to  be  permitted  to
        enter the UK to enable them to donate a kidney is correct.
    13. It was submitted by Mrs James both before the  First-tier  Tribunal
        and ourselves that the wife and particularly the son would be  able
        to provide the necessary transplant  if  required  and  to  provide
        medical care to the sponsor whilst at home. The sponsor in his oral
        evidence stated that he believes his wife and son will be  able  to
        provide a kidney for his use if necessary.
    14. The judge found in paragraph  19  that  the  sponsor  had  produced
        documents to show he earned in excess of the figure quoted for  the
        two appellants and that he had sufficient for the purposes  of  the
        Immigration Rules. As stated above, the initial  finding  was  that
        the documentation provided did not show that  the  required  income
        was available and that the Rules could not be met. Article 8 in  an
        ECO decision has to be considered on the basis of  the  information
        and facts not available at the date of application but at the  date
        of decision when it is clear the  sponsor  was  ill  and  had  been
        signed off as being unfit to work and had left his employment.  His
        claims to have received sickness pay is not proved or exhibited  as
        required by Appendix FM-SE. The judge appears to have accepted that
        this is the case and that the Rules cannot be satisfied as a result
        of the sponsor's health condition.  Evidence  of  the  illness  and
        inability to  work  predated  the  decision  and  was  a  situation
        appertaining at the date of decision.
    15. The inability to work and earn the required income would leave  the
        family dependent  upon  state  benefits  which  would  have  to  be
        increased beyond the level currently received by the sponsor if the
        appellants were permitted to enter the UK to join the family  unit.
        The judge also fails to mention section 117  (as  amended)  of  the
        Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The decision was made
        on the 7th November 2014. From 28  July  2014  section  19  of  the
        Immigration Act 2014 is brought into force by the  Immigration  Act
        2014 (Commencement No 1, Transitory and  Saving  Provisions)  Order
        2014 (SI 2014/1820). This amends the Nationality,  Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 2002 by introducing a new Part 5A  which  applies  where
        the Tribunal considers article 8(2) ECHR directly i.e.  outside  of
        the  Rules.  These  provisions   bring   in   mandatory   statutory
        requirements relating to the weight to be attached  to  the  public
        interest under Article 8 which  override  existing  case  law.  The
        First-tier Tribunal were considering Article 8 directly, after  the
        commencement date.
    16. By virtue of section  117A,  in  considering  the  public  interest
        question, the tribunal must (in particular) have regard (a) in  all
        cases, to the considerations listed in section  117B,  and  (b)  in
        cases concerning the  deportation  of  foreign  criminals,  to  the
        considerations listed in section 117C. Subsection (2) provides that
        "the public interest question" means the  question  of  whether  an
        interference with a person's  right  to  respect  for  private  and
        family life is justified under Article 8(2). Section  117A  (2)  is
        mandatory.  As the public  interest  provisions  are  contained  in
        primary legislation they override existing case law.  Section  117A
        (3) confirms that the Tribunal is required to carry out a balancing
        exercise.  In other words, the Tribunal cannot  just  rely  on  the
        listed public interest factors as a basis for rejecting a claim but
        must carry out a balancing exercise where a person's  circumstances
        engage Article 8(1) to decide whether the proposed interference  is
        proportionate in all the circumstances. Section 117B sets  out  the
        public interest considerations applicable  in  all  cases.  Section
        117C sets out additional considerations in cases involving  foreign
        criminals. Section 117D is  the  interpretation  section.  Sections
        117D (2), (3) and (4) reflect but are not identical to sections  33
        and 38 of the UK Borders Act 2007.
    17. Section 117B  reads:  Article  8:  public  interest  considerations
        applicable  in  all  cases:   (1)The   maintenance   of   effective
        immigration controls is in the public interest; (2) It  is  in  the
        public interest, and in particular in the interests of the economic
        well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or
        remain in the United Kingdom are able  to  speak  English,  because
        persons who can  speak  English-  (a)  are  less  of  a  burden  on
        taxpayers, and (b) are better able to integrate into  society;  (3)
        It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
        the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  persons  who
        seek to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
        independent,  because  such  persons-  (a)  are  not  a  burden  on
        taxpayers, and (b) are better able to integrate into  society;  (4)
        Little weight should be given to- (a)  a private life,  or  (b)   a
        relationship formed with a qualifying partner,  that is established
        by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the  United  Kingdom
        unlawfully; (5) Little weight should be given  to  a  private  life
        established by a person at a time  when  the  person's  immigration
        status is precarious; (6) In the case of a person who is not liable
        to deportation, the public interest does not require  the  person's
        removal where- (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
        relationship with a qualifying child,  and  (b)  it  would  not  be
        reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.
    18. In Dube (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC) it was held that (i)
        Key features of ss.117A-117D of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 2002 include the  following:  (a)  judges  are  required
        statutorily  to  take  into  account   a   number   of   enumerated
        considerations. Sections 117A-117D are  not,  therefore,  an  a  la
        carte menu of considerations that it is at the  discretion  of  the
        judge to apply or  not  apply.   Judges  are  duty-bound  to  "have
        regard" to the specified considerations. (b) These  provisions  are
        only expressed as being binding on a "court or tribunal". It may be
        that the Secretary of State will consider it in  the  interests  of
        good administration and consistency of decision-making on Article 8
        claims at  all  levels  to  have  express  regard  to  ss.117A-117D
        considerations herself, but she is not directly bound to do so. (c)
        whilst expressed in mandatory terms, the  considerations  specified
        are not expressed as being exhaustive: note use of the  phrase  "in
        particular" in s.117A(2): "  In  considering  the  public  interest
        question, the court or tribunal must (in particular)  have  regard-
        ". (d) Section 117B enumerates considerations that  are  applicable
        "in all cases", which must include  foreign  criminal  cases.  Thus
        when s.117C (which deals with foreign  criminals)  states  that  it
        sets out "additional" considerations that must mean  considerations
        in addition to those set out in s.117B. (e) sections  117A-117D  do
        not represent any kind of radical departure from or  "override"  of
        previous case law on Article 8 so far as concerns the  need  for  a
        structured approach. In particular, they do not  disturb  the  need
        for judges to ask themselves the five questions set out  in  Razgar
        [2004] UKHL 27.   Sections  117A-117D  are  essentially  a  further
        elaboration of Razgar's  question  5  which  is  essentially  about
        proportionality and justifiability. (ii) It is not an error of  law
        to fail to refer to ss.117A-117D considerations if  the  judge  has
        applied the test he or she was supposed to apply according  to  its
        terms; what matters is substance, not form.
    19. The judge erred in paragraph  21  by  referring  to  the  fact  the
        sponsor was able to satisfy the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
        Rules at the date of application  as  if  this  was  relevant  when
        assessing the human rights situation at the date  of  decision.  At
        that date the requirements of the Rules could not  be  met  as  the
        sponsor was too ill to work.  There  is  also  no  mention  of  the
        ability of the appellants to speak English. It is noted  the  first
        appellant  only  speaks  Punjabi  and  Hindi   according   to   her
        application form (paragraph 1.22 - 1.22).
    20. The judge in paragraph 22 states that if the appellants are  unable
        to succeed under the  Rules  then  Article  8  can  be  applied  in
        connection with the application. The use of the term "Article 8 can
        be applied" is not clearly explained as Article 8  cannot  used  to
        circumvent the requirements of the Rules. The judge  further  erred
        when finding in the same paragraph that "it is almost certain  that
        the son of the sponsor, one of  the  Appellants,  would  reach  the
        compatibility sought  for  the  transplant  itself"  which  is  not
        supported by the available evidence, as a range of tests will  need
        to be undertaken to ascertain if a person is a suitable  compatible
        donor to show the medical, psychological, logistical and  financial
        considerations are satisfied. The statement by the  judge  that  to
        deny the second appellant access to the  United  Kingdom  would  in
        effect  deny  the  sponsor  the  opportunity  to   live   is   pure
        supposition, not adequately reasoned,  and  not  supported  by  the
        evidence. Mr Smart also raised before us the fact a kidney could be
        taken in India and transported to the UK for the sponsor.  We  have
        seen no evidence to support this claim but we do not have to decide
        if it is right.
    21. The sponsor is a British citizen who is receiving care  within  the
        NHS. There is a shortage of donors in the  UK  but  he  is  on  the
        transplant list and it has not been shown he  will  not  receive  a
        compatible organ if one  becomes  available  and  he  is  the  next
        inline. There is no evidence confirming the suitability  of  either
        of the appellants as suitable donors and the medical evidence  does
        not support the claim their admission to the UK is  essential.  The
        evidence does not show Articles 3 or 8 are engaged in  relation  to
        the sponsor. N v UK [2008] 47 EHRR 39 considered.
    22. The basis of the finding that the decision is  disproportionate  is
        the ongoing effect it is claimed refusal will have on the  sponsor,
        but this is a finding not supported to this extent on the available
        material.
    23. We find the errors in relation to the Immigration Rules and Article
        8 to be material and set the determination aside.
    24. In remaking the decision we  are  constrained  by  considering  the
        situation at the date of  decision.  It  has  not  been  shown  the
        Immigration Rules could be met at that time and the appeals on this
        basis are dismissed.
    25. Article 8 does not permit a person  to  circumvent  the  Rules,  as
        stated above, and the Court of Appeal recently provided guidance in
        the case of Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo)
        [2015] EWCA Civ 387 in relation to  the  assessment  of  Article  8
        claims. It has not  been  shown  on  the  available  evidence  that
        sufficiently  compelling  circumstances  exist   (which   are   not
        sufficiently recognised under the new Rules) to require  the  grant
        of such leave. The requirements of section 117 cannot  be  met,  in
        relation to financial independence and ability  to  speak  English,
        which we have considered as part of the overall balancing  exercise
        we are required to undertake. We also  note  the  further  guidance
        provided by the Court of Appeal in GS (India) [2015]  EWCA  Civ  40
        regarding not being able to use simply Article 8 instead of Article
        3 in health cases.
    26. We dismiss the appeal of  the  first  and  second  appellant  under
        Article 8 ECHR. The Secretary  of  State  has  made  out  that  the
        decision is proportionate by reference to the facts and law.
    27. As an aside, and no more, if the appellants  obtain  evidence  they
        are a suitable match  for  the  purposes  of  donation  and/or  are
        willing to donate,  the  Immigration  Rules  were  amended  on  6th
        November 2014 to allow those seeking entry  to  be  assessed  as  a
        potential donor or to donate an organ  to  apply  for  entry  as  a
        general visitor. This brings together the previous arrangements for
        all organ donors. The requirements are set out at paragraph 41a  of
        the Immigration Rules and guidance is provided in the  Home  Office
        Modernised Guidance for General Visitors which can be accessed  on-
        line.




Decision

    28. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. We set aside
        the decision of the original Judge. We remake the decision as
        follows. These appeals are dismissed


   Anonymity.


    29. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005.


          We make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal
   Procedure           (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
