For the Respondent:    Mr E. Barr, Counsel instructed by Jasvir Jutla & Co
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Bulgaria born in 1979. The Secretary of
    State  has  decided,  on  public  policy  grounds,  to  deport  him  in
    accordance with Regulation 27 of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2016. On the 20th March 2019 the First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Juss) allowed his appeal against that decision. The Secretary of
    State now has permission to appeal.


 2. The bare facts are these.  The Respondent came to live and work in  the
    United Kingdom in 2013. He has a partner here ('Ms M') and a child (I),
    who was born in March 2017. Both of the Respondent's parents  live  and
    work in the United Kingdom. On the 30th  May  2017  the  Appellant  was
    convicted at Leicester Crown Court of blackmail. He had secretly filmed
    a woman while having an intimate relationship with  her  and  had  then
    threatened to upload the film to  the  internet  unless  she  paid  him
    ï¿½4000. For this crime the Respondent was sentenced  to  1  year  and  4
    months in prison.


 3. The First-tier Tribunal found that since the Respondent  had  lived  in
    the United Kingdom less than five years at the date of the Secretary of
    State's decision, he  was  entitled  to  only  the  "basic  protection"
    offered by the Regulations.  That said, the Tribunal was not  satisfied
    that the Secretary of State had  discharged  the  burden  upon  him  to
    establish that the Respondent's conduct represented a "genuine, present
    and sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
    interests of society".  The Tribunal  notes  that  the  Respondent  had
    committed this single offence. He had admitted  his  guilt  before  the
    criminal court and had been sentenced on that basis. He  had  expressed
    remorse. The  Secretary  of  State's  conclusion  that  the  Respondent
    presents a "real" threat to society was apparently based solely on  the
    fact that he was in prison serving his  sentence  of  imprisonment  for
    this offence. On the evidence presented the Tribunal was  not  able  to
    make a predictive assessment that the Respondent posed a  risk  in  the
    future. That was not, in accordance with the Regulations, sufficient to
    discharge the burden.    Furthermore, the  Tribunal  did  not  consider
    that deportation action was a proportionate response.    The  Secretary
    of State accepted that the Respondent  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with  his  son  and  the  Tribunal  accepted  the
    evidence of Ms M that if he were to be deported she would  be  left  to
    bring up their son alone,  since  she  is  established  in  the  United
    Kingdom and would not contemplate returning to  Bulgaria.   The  appeal
    was thereby allowed, with reference to the Regulations  and  Article  8
    ECHR.


 4. The Secretary of State now appeals on the following grounds:


          i) The Tribunal accepted that the Respondent  had  shown  genuine
             remorse because of his guilty plea.  The  Secretary  of  State
             submits  that  a  guilty  plea  is  not  determinative  of   a
             fundamental acceptance of  criminal  behaviour.  The  Tribunal
             does not weigh in the balance the  fact  that  the  Respondent
             described the offence as a "joke" in his live evidence;


         ii) The Tribunal failed to weigh in the balance the fact that  the
             Respondent  is  subject  to  a  five-year  restraining  order,
             "compelling and incontrovertible evidence that he  presents  a
             risk to society";


        iii)  The  Tribunal  took  immaterial  factors  into   account   in
             apparently  attaching  weight  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
             failure to produce any  of  the  relevant  material  from  the
             probation service, such as an OASys report.




    Discussion and Findings

 5. There is no merit in ground (iii).  Although  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    describes the absence of an OASys report as a "remarkable  feature"  of
    this case it is not at all clear that  it  placed  any  weight  on  the
    absence of this evidence. The point made [at its paragraph 30] is  that
    the burden lies on the Secretary of State to show that  the  individual
    concerned poses a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society.   In  order  to
    discharge that burden the Secretary of State did no more than  rely  on
    the fact of the conviction, and that the Respondent was, at the date of
    the decision to deport, still in jail. It was in that context that  the
    First-tier Tribunal  mentioned  the  fact  that  there  was  no  formal
    assessment of risk by the probation service.


 6. In respect of ground (i) I accept Mr Mills' submission  that  a  guilty
    plea may be entered for  entirely  pragmatic  reasons,  but  I  am  not
    satisfied that the plea was the sole basis for the  Tribunal's  finding
    that the Respondent had shown genuine remorse.  The Respondent had told
    the Tribunal himself that he was sorry about the offence, and this  was
    found to be consistent with the fact that he  had  entered  a  plea  of
    'guilty', on a full-facts basis, at the earliest  possible  opportunity
    before the Crown Court.   He had also told the sentencing judge that he
    felt remorse for what he had done.  The Tribunal was entitled to accept
    that evidence. It cannot be said that it overlooked the fact  that  the
    Respondent had described his actions as a "joke", since that matter  is
    expressly set out at paragraph 8. It is apparent from the determination
    overall that the Tribunal proceeded on the basis  that  the  Respondent
    was guilty of blackmail. It nowhere sought to diminish the significance
    of that very serious offence.

 7. In respect of ground (ii) Mr Mills emphasised the  point  made  in  the
    written grounds that the Tribunal nowhere weighs  in  the  balance  the
    fact that the sentencing judge  had  imposed  a  five-year  restraining
    order on the Respondent. This, he submitted, clearly  went  to  whether
    the courts considered the Respondent to pose a continuing risk.   I  am
    satisfied that the restraining order (a civil  sanction  imposed  under
    section 5 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997) may be a material
    factor in the assessment of future risk.  I cannot however be satisfied
    that that here the First-tier Tribunal can be properly  criticised  for
    not giving it express consideration.  First, because it is not clear to
    me what risk this established over and  above  the  imposition  of  the
    criminal sanction, but more importantly because it  was  not  a  matter
    relied upon by the Secretary of State at the hearing. Paragraph  12  of
    the determination records the  Presenting  Officer's  submissions.  The
    HOPO does not rely on the Order to prove the Secretary of State's case.
    Nor does the refusal letter, the material part of which is at paragraph
    19:


         "It is believed that you pose a genuine, present  and  sufficiently
         serious threat to the interests of the UK. The threat you  pose  is
         real, when taking into account your conduct and the seriousness  of
         your offence. The threat you pose is believed to be present, as you
         are currently serving a custodial  sentence,  you  will  remain  on
         licence following your release until around 30 September 2018,  and
         you have provided no evidence that you are  rehabilitated  or  have
         taken any steps to address your thinking and behaviour"


 8. In his oral submissions Mr Mills raised  a  point  not  argued  in  the
    grounds.  At paragraph 32 of its determination the First-tier  Tribunal
    says this: "The Appellant has not  been  a  'persistent  offender'  and
    there is no evidence that he is at high risk of  offending".  Mr  Mills
    challenges the formulation "high risk". He correctly  points  out  that
    the Regs require the Secretary of State only to establish  a  "genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society".   'Sufficiently  serious'  does  not
    mean 'high'. I am satisfied  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  here
    misdirect itself. I am not however satisfied that the misdirection  was
    material. That is because, on the evidence  before  the  Tribunal,  the
    Secretary  of  State  was  not  able  to  discharge  the  burden  under
    Regulation 27(5)(c). The First-tier Tribunal  was  not  satisfied  that
    there was any risk of reoffending; it was satisfied that the Respondent
    had shown genuine remorse and it was his only criminal offence.


    Decisions


 9. The determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal  does  not  contain  any
    material error of law and it is upheld.

10. There is no order for anonymity.
