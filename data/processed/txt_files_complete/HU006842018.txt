For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 12 October 1978 who is
    married to a British citizen, is appealing against the decision of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Clarke promulgated on 4 October 2018.

 2. On 5 September 2017 the appellant applied for entry clearance to the UK
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules as the spouse of a British
    citizen.  Her application was refused for the sole reason that the most
    recent pay slip submitted was said to be dated 31 July 2017, which was
    more than 28 days prior to the application.

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. She requested that
    the appeal be considered without a hearing. On 5 June 2018 the Tribunal
    directed the appellant to file by 1 August 2018 the evidence upon which
    she wished to rely in support of her appeal.  A bundle was duly lodged
    with the Tribunal and received on 1 August 2018.

 4. The appeal was considered on the papers on 2 August 2018.  It is clear
    from the decision that the judge did not have before him the bundle of
    evidence that was submitted by the appellant.

 5. At the error of law hearing Mr Tarlow accepted that the judge had made
    an error of law by not considering the bundle of evidence that was
    submitted to the Tribunal and that as a consequence the decision could
    not stand.

 6. The sole issue before the First-tier Tribunal was the absence of a pay
    slip covering a period within 28 days of the hearing as required by
    Appendix FM-SE.  The bundle that was submitted to the First-tier
    Tribunal but not seen by Judge Clarke includes a pay slip dated 31
    August 2017. This covers the required period.

 7. Mr Tarlow accepted that the evidence demonstrates the appellant
    satisfies the requirements of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE and that
    the appeal should be allowed under Article 8 ECHR as there is no public
    interest in refusing entry to the appellant.

 8. I agree with Mr Tarlow. I therefore set aside the decision and remake
    the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

I remake the decision of the First-tier Tribunal by allowing the
appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
