                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.    The Appellant  (the  Secretary  of  State)  appealed  with  permission
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge JM  Holmes  on  27  November  2014
    against the determination of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Norton-Taylor
    who had allowed the Respondent's appeal against the Removal  Directions
    made  against  him  under  section  47  of  Immigration,   Asylum   and
    Nationality Act 2006 to the extent of returning  the  decision  to  the
    Secretary of State for a lawful decision to be made.  The determination
    was promulgated on 11 September 2014.

2.    The Respondent is a national of Colombia, born on  29  February  1976.
    He had sought leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the  grounds  of
    continuous  lawful  long  residence  under  paragraph   276B   of   the
    Immigration Rules.   Judge Norton-Taylor found that the Respondent  met
    the requirements of the relevant immigration rule and that  no  gap  in
    his residence had exceeded 28 days, by  virtue  of  the  provisions  of
    section 3C of the Immigration Act  1971.   The  judge  found  that  the
    Secretary of State  had  yet  to  exercise  her  discretion  under  sub
    paragraph 276B(ii) and found that the decision to refuse the Respondent
    further leave and to remove him was thus defective.

3.    Permission to appeal was granted because it  was  considered  arguable
    that the judge had erred in  his  finding(s)  as  to  the  Respondent's
    access to section 3C leave.  The  Respondent  had  not  challenged  the
    rejection by the Secretary of State  of  his  application  made  on  27
    January 2005 for failure to pay the requisite fee.  Zahoor [2014]  EWHC
    2751 (Admin) applied.  The applications in question  had  been  invalid
    and there had been no 3C leave available in consequence.

4.    Standard directions were made by the  tribunal,  indicating  that  the
    appeal would be reheard immediately if a material  error  of  law  were
    found.  The Respondent filed a rule 24 notice opposing the appeal dated
    7 January 2015.

Submissions - error of law

5.    Mr Tarlow for the Appellant relied on the grounds on which  permission
    to appeal had been granted and the grant itself.  The judge's  findings
    had relied on the application of section 3C,  but  the  Respondent  had
    been deprived of access to section 3C leave  because  he  had  made  an
    invalid application. Zahoor (above) explained the relevant law and  was
    persuasive. The replacement application had been made on 11 March 2005,
    making it out of time, thereby  breaking  the  Respondent's  period  of
    lawful residence.  Fees were payable on each application at that  time.
    [25] and [31] of the determination  were  mistaken.  The  determination
    should be set aside, and the decision remade, dismissing the appeal.

6.    Mr Saeed for the Respondent relied on the rule 24 notice.   The  facts
    were different from those considered in Zahoor.  The  application  made
    on 27 January 2005 was not invalid because it  did  not  fall  foul  of
    regulations 11 and 12 of the Immigration (Leave to Remain)  (Prescribed
    Forms and Procedures) Regulations  2003.   Similarly,  the  application
    made on 30 January 2006 was not invalid because it did not fall foul of
    regulations 13 and 14 of the Immigration (Leave to Remain)  (Prescribed
    Forms  and  Procedures)  Regulations  2005.   Alternatively,  paragraph
    276B(iii) did not specify that it applied solely to valid applications.

7.    The judge had found at [24] of his determination that the  application
    dated 21 January 2005 received  27  January  2005  had  been  submitted
    before the expiry of the Respondent's existing leave  to  remain.   The
    Respondent was required by regulation 5 of the  Immigration  (Leave  to
    Remain) (Prescribed Forms and Procedures) Regulations 2003 to  use  the
    prescribed from, FLRS 08/2003, which he had done.  That  form  did  not
    specify a fee nor did it demand a fee be  sent  with  the  application.
    Nevertheless there was no dispute that a fee was payable.

8.    Regulation 12 of the Immigration (Leave to Remain)  (Prescribed  Forms
    and  Procedures)  Regulations  2003  laid  down   the   procedure   for
    invalidation.  Regulation 12 (b) required the  Secretary  of  State  to
    notify the applicant within  21  days  of  a  failure  to  comply  with
    regulation 11(a) or (b), which gave the applicant 28 days from then  to
    comply with the requirements.  That was not done.  Non payment  of  the
    fee was given by the Secretary of State as the  reason  for  rejection.
    The Secretary of  State  had  not  followed  her  own  procedure.   The
    Secretary of State had not notified the Respondent  until  28  February
    2005, which was too late.  The application  could  not  be  treated  as
    invalid.

9.    Because the application the subject of the appeal had been made  after
    9 July 2012, gaps of 28 days or less fell to  be  disregarded,  as  the
    judge had correctly stated at [27] of his determination.

10.   The second challenged application for  further  leave  to  remain  had
    been made on 16 January 2006.  On a worst case scenario the  delay  was
    17 days, so the judge could not have been wrong since Immigration  Rule
    276B(5) applied and the delay fell to be disregarded.  The  Immigration
    (Leave to Remain) (Fees) Regulations 2005 applied.  Again there was  no
    reference to fees in the 2005 Regulations or in the  application  form.
    Zahoor (above) had a different  set  of  facts  and  was  inapplicable.
    There was no error of law and the determination should stand unchanged.



11.   In reply, Mr Tarlow submitted that while Zahoor referred to  the  2011
    Fees Regulations, there had been earlier fee regulations  on  which  he
    relied to demonstrate the error of law by the judge.    Mr  Tarlow  was
    unable to name the earlier regulations. Mr Tarlow  indicated  that  the
    Home Office were not willing to concede the appeal.

Material error of law finding

12.   The tribunal reserved its determination which now follows.

13.   It was not in dispute that the Respondent was required to  pay  a  fee
    in 2005 and again in 2006.  The tribunal  was  not  provided  with  the
    reference by either party but provision for the payment  of  fees  with
    applications for various categories of leave to remain  was  introduced
    by  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  1999.    An  example  of   such
    regulations is the Immigration (Leave  to  remain)  (Fees)  Regulations
    2003.  There was no express reference to the consequences of failure to
    pay the prescribed in the Immigration  (Leave  to  Remain)  (Prescribed
    Forms and Procedures) Regulations 2003 or  the  Immigration  (Leave  to
    Remain) (Prescribed Forms and Procedures) Regulations  2005.   Nor  was
    there any warning on the relevant prescribed application form.  That it
    was considered plain to anyone that the failure to pay  the  prescribed
    fee would invalidate  the  application  is  demonstrated  by  the  Home
    Office's rejection of the Respondent's  application  dated  21  January
    2005, and the absence of any challenge by the Respondent.  This was not
    mentioned in the determination.

14.   Had the judge fallen into error of law?  Two gaps in the  Respondent's
    leave to remain were in dispute, which the judge examined  at  [23]  to
    [28] of his determination.    There is no  indication  that  the  issue
    identified in the grounds of onwards appeal was raised before the judge
    in express terms, however the Home Office's position had been that  the
    first gap had been in excess of 28 days. Nor was Zahoor  cited  to  the
    judge. In the tribunal's view, although the judge dealt conscientiously
    with the appeal, the essential invalidity issue relating to section  3C
    leave was not addressed by him.  He is not to be criticised  since  the
    issue was not identified with sufficient clarity by  the  Home  Office,
    but the issue remains of  importance.   In  the  tribunal's  view  this
    amounted to a material error of law which requires the determination to
    be remade.   The Secretary of State's appeal is accordingly allowed.

The fresh decision

15.   The position of the parties had been made clear and so  there  was  no
    need for any further submissions.  In this part  of  the  determination
    the parties will be referred to by  their  original  designations,  for
    clarity and convenience.

16.   The issue is whether the Appellant acquired any 3C leave in  2005  and
    also in 2006.  BE (application fee: effect  of  non-payment)  Mauritius
    [2008] UKAIT 00089, where the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  examined
    regulation 16 of the Immigration and Nationality (Cost  Recovery  Fees)
    Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/936) and decided that  an  application  for
    leave to remain which is not accompanied by the specified fee is not  a
    valid application. Subsequent  payment  does  not  affect  the  earlier
    invalid application.  That conclusion was not  a  surprising  one.   BE
    (above) was approved and followed in Zahoor.

17.   Zahoor was based in part on an interpretation of regulation 37 of  the
    Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2011.  Basnet  (validity
    of application - respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113  (IAC)  and  BE  (above)
    were considered by the court.     The facts of Zahoor  (which  were  of
    some complexity) were significantly different from those of the present
    appeal.  The Home Office now usually collect fees by direct debit  from
    the applicant's bank account.   No such facilities  were  available  in
    2005, at which time applications had to be accompanied by a  cheque  or
    cash. His Honour Judge Anthony Thornton QC, sitting as a Judge  of  the
    High Court, concluded that (in 2011) the validity of an application for
    further leave to remain was determined by whether the specified fee (or
    facilities for its collection) had  been  provided.   An  extension  of
    leave under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 could only arise  if
    a valid application  had  been  made.   Again,  these  conclusions  are
    logical and the tribunal considers that  Judge  Thornton's  conclusions
    are persuasive and should guide it.

18.   No  parallel  to  regulation  16  or  regulation  37  in  any  of  the
    regulations in force in 2005 was  identified  by  either  side  in  the
    current appeal.  Mr Saaed's submission was that the failure  to  submit
    the specified fee had no consequences for validity  and  that,  in  any
    event, the Secretary of State was bound to contact the Appellant within
    21 days if there were a problem with his application.

19.   Although the case was attractively argued by Mr  Saaed,  the  tribunal
    is unable to accept that it can be right.  While no doubt the 2007  and
    2011 fees regulations have provided additional clarity, it is not  easy
    to see how an application where no fee has been paid could or should be
    treated as valid.  The Home  Office  records  produced  show  that  the
    Appellant's application recorded as received on  27  January  2005  was
    "rejected" for non payment of the specified fee.   When  the  Appellant
    reapplied with the specified fee on 11  March  2005,  he  was  by  then
    without leave to remain.  Leave to remain was granted on 18 April 2005.
     This left a gap in leave of 77 days from the expiry of his last  leave
    to remain on 31 January 2005.

20.   The Appellant's solicitors had obtained his immigration  records  from
    the Home Office by a subject access request.  A copy of the case record
    sheet appears at page 125 of  the  Appellant's  bundle.   There  is  no
    indication there that any fee was paid.  This may be compared with  his
    previous application, accepted as valid (the fees  receipt  is  noted),
    but refused because the Appellant had  sought  to  study  an  excessive
    number of short courses.  There was no right of appeal to that  refusal
    because the Appellant still had extant leave.

21.   Because no fee had been paid  with  the  application  received  on  27
    January 2005, in the tribunal's view the provisions of regulation 12 of
    the Immigration (Leave to Remain)  (Prescribed  Forms  and  Procedures)
    Regulations 2003 did not apply.  They are directed to regulations 11(a)
    and 11(b), signing  and  dating  of  the  form  and  provision  of  the
    specified documents and photographs.  The payment of the prescribed fee
    was a separate condition precedent to acceptance  of  the  application.
    There was no evidence that the fee had been paid.  The  fact  that  the
    Appellant made a further,  ultimately  successful  repeat  application,
    indicates that the fee had not been  paid  on  27  January  2005.   The
    tribunal so finds.  The result is that the Appellant had  no  leave  to
    remain from 31 January 2005 until 18 April 2005, a gap of 77 days which
    exceeds the permitted gap of 28 days by some margin.  The  tribunal  so
    finds.

22.   As to the later gap in 2006,  this  was  after  the  Appellant's  next
    period of leave to remain, which ran from 18 April 2005 to  30  January
    2006.  The Home Office records show that the Appellant paid the fee due
    but that his application was submitted 17  days  out  of  time,  on  16
    February 2006.  There had been a previous in time application but again
    no fee had been sent and it was properly  rejected.   But  because  the
    Appellant had applied out of time, the decision was not  made  until  8
    March 2006, creating a gap in leave of 37 days.  The tribunal so finds.

23.   Both gaps exceed the 28 period which would  fall  to  be  disregarded.
    The result is that the Appellant  failed  to  show  that  he  had  held
    continuous lawful leave to remain in the United Kingdom for a period of
    10 years.  His appeal under the Immigration Rules  fails  and  must  be
    dismissed. There was no suggestion that the Appellant  qualified  under
    any  other  potentially  relevant  Immigration  Rule,  e.g.,  paragraph
    276ADE.

24.   The Appellant had also raised an Article 8 ECHR  private  life  claim.
    This was not addressed by Judge Norton-Taylor.  There had been no  need
    to do so on his view of the appeal.  It was in any event  very  much  a
    subsidiary claim.

25.   In  his  witness  statement  dated  5  September  2014  the  Appellant
    maintained that he had a subsisting private life in the United Kingdom.
     He gave no further details.  He produced evidence  that  he  had  been
    working.  His previous grants of leave had all been in the capacity  of
    student.  There was no suggestion that  considerations  such  as  those
    discussed in CDS (Points Based System: "available": Article  8)  Brazil
    [2010] UKUT 00305 (IAC) might  have  applied  to  him  in  his  student
    capacity.  He provided no evidence of any  exceptional,  compelling  or
    compassionate circumstances which might have applied to him.

26.   In the skeleton argument dated 4  September  2014,  submitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal, it was said:

    "The Appellant submits that his rights under Article 8 ECHR of the ECHR
    are engaged.  The Appellant submits that, in all the circumstances. The
    Respondent's decision  is  disproportionate,  and  hence  breaches  his
    rights under Article 8 ECHR."

27.   In the tribunal's view  this  submission  takes  matters  no  further.
    There was no evidence of any private life which was  not  transferrable
    to the Appellant's home country; see, e.g., Nasim and  Others  (Article
    8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC).  There is no  "near  miss"  principle:  see
    Miah and ors v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 261.  There was no evidence of  any
    matter which might have required the Secretary of State to consider the
    exercise of discretion outside the Immigration Rules in the Appellant's
    favour: see Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct  approach)  [2013]
    UKUT 00640  (IAC),  MM  (Lebanon)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985  and  related
    authorities.

28.   The tribunal finds that the decision to refuse the  Appellant  further
    leave to remain and to remove him is  proportionate  and  reflects  the
    legitimate objectives of Article 8.2 ECHR.  His appeal under Article  8
    ECHR is dismissed.
