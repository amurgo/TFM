Representation:

For the Appellant:     Dr S Chelvan, instructed by S M A Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

The burden of proof remains on  the  appellant,  where  the  respondent  has
identified the location to which it is  asserted  they  could  relocate,  to
prove why that location would be unduly harsh, in line with AMM  and  others
(conflict; humanitarian crisis; returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011]  UKUT  445
(IAC), but within that burden, the evaluation exercise should  be  holistic.
An holistic approach to such an assessment is consistent with  the  balance-
sheet approach endorsed later in SSHD v SC (Jamaica) [2017] EWCA  Civ  2112,
at paragraphs [40] and [41]. MM v Minister for  Justice,  Equality  and  Law
Reform, Ireland (Common European Asylum System - Directive 2004/83/EC)  Case
C-277/11 does not impose a burden on the respondent or result  in  a  formal
sharing of the burden of proof, but merely confirms a  duty  of  cooperation
at the stage of assessment,  for  example  the  production  of  the  country
information reports.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the remaking of the decision in the appellant's appeal against
      the respondent's refusal of her human rights and protection claim.

   2. The appellant, a citizen of Albania, made a claim on  15  March  2017,
      based on her accepted bisexuality and the  consequent  hostility  from
      her father, whom she said had threatened to kill  her.  She  had  left
      Albania in February 2017 after a period of study at the University  in
      Tirana and entered the United Kingdom ('UK') in March 2017.

   3.  The  respondent  refused  the  appellant's   protection   claim   and
      application for leave to remain based on human rights  in  a  decision
      dated 10 April 2017 (the 'Decision').

   4. The appellant's subsequent appeal was originally dismissed by a First-
      tier Tribunal Judge, (the 'FTT') in a decision promulgated on 27  July
      2017. The FTT's decision was challenged and at a hearing on 2  October
      2018, the Upper Tribunal, comprising a panel of  The  Honourable  Lady
      Rae, sitting as a judge of the Upper  Tribunal,  together  with  Upper
      Tribunal Judge Dawson, set the FTT's decision aside, while  preserving
      specific findings; and adjourned the case for a hearing to remake  the
      Decision. A copy of their error of law decision  is  annexed  to  this
      remaking decision.

   5. In  setting  aside  the  FTT's  decision,  the  Upper  Tribunal  panel
      concluded that the FTT had  erred  when  considering  the  appellant's
      ability to internally relocate within Albania, by failing to  indicate
      the precise destination that she could internally relocate to, thereby
      considering that issue in a vacuum.  The question that the FTT  should
      have asked, once the destination was  decided  upon,  was  whether  it
      would be reasonable for her to live in such a place that might require
      her to  keep  her  sexuality  secret  from  landlords,  employers  and
      friends. This would need to  be  considered  in  the  context  of  the
      appellant's mental health.

   6. The Upper Tribunal preserved the FTT's findings as to the  risk  faced
      by the appellant from her father and the reach of that risk, such that
      she could not  internally  relocate  to  Tirana,  Tepele,  Durres  and
      Volore. The respondent had asserted in the Decision that the appellant
      would be able to internally relocate to Shkod�r in northern Albania.

    The core issues in this appeal

   7. The central issue for us is whether it would be unduly harsh to expect
      the appellant to relocate to Shkod�r. The parties did not produce  any
      additional evidence that was not before the FTT and instead each  said
      that the burden of proving that internal relocation was, or  was  not,
      unduly harsh, was on the other party.  The appellant asserted that the
      respondent had produced no evidence on which this Tribunal could  rely
      to show that relocation to Shkod�r was not unduly  harsh;  whilst  the
      respondent asserted that having  identified  the  city  to  which  the
      appellant could relocate, it was  for  the  appellant  to  provide  an
      explanation, together with evidence, as to  why  it  would  be  unduly
      harsh for her to relocate  there;  and  that  the  appellant's  appeal
      should fail because there was an absence of evidence to  suggest  that
      relocation would be unduly harsh. Accordingly, tied in with the  issue
      of internal relocation was the question of where the burden  of  proof
      lay.

   8. Whilst the appellant had continued to pursue all grounds of  challenge
      to the FTT's decision, including those relating to an  assertion  that
      the level of discrimination within Albania was of such  severity  that
      it amounted to persecution and  that  there  was  not  sufficiency  of
      protection in Albania, there were no  substantive  submissions  by  Dr
      Chelvan on these grounds  and  we  reminded  ourselves  that  we  were
      remaking the FTT decision and so were not limited to  the  grounds  of
      challenge.  However, no additional  evidence,  beyond  recent  Country
      Guidance, as to  which  we  say  more  later  in  this  decision,  was
      provided, which was not available to the FTT.

      Burden of proof

   9. It was of some surprise to  us  that  in  referring  to  a  number  of
      authorities, neither party referred us to the Court of Appeal case  of
      SSHD v SC  (Jamaica)  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  2112,  in  which  the  Senior
      President of Tribunals addressed the burden and standard of  proof  in
      respect of internal relocation. Nevertheless, we drew this case to the
      attention of the representatives, who were able to address us  on  the
      case.

      The appellant's submissions


  10. Dr Chelvan developed his submission that the appellant's  appeal  must
      succeed as the respondent  had  failed  to  discharge  its  duty  with
      reference  to  article  8  of  the  Qualification   Directive   ('QD')
      2004/83/EC, which deals with internal protection, and which is set out
      below:

      "1.     As part of the assessment of the application for international
      protection, Member States may determine that an applicant  is  not  in
      need of international protection if in a part of the country of origin
      there is no well-founded fear of being persecuted or no real  risk  of
      suffering serious harm and the applicant can reasonably be expected to
      stay in that part of the country.
      2.     In examining whether a part of the  country  of  origin  is  in
      accordance with paragraph 1, Member States shall at the time of taking
      the  decision  on  the  application  have  regard   to   the   general
      circumstances prevailing in that  part  of  the  country  and  to  the
      personal circumstances of the applicant."

  11. In essence, the respondent had failed to have regard at  the  time  of
      taking the Decision the general circumstances prevailing  in  Shkod�r,
      in the context of the appellant's personal circumstances and that  was
      a minimum requirement, the burden of which was on the respondent.  The
      respondent could  not  now  seek  to  remedy  the  absence  of  proper
      consideration, but in any event, had not produced any evidence  to  do
      so.



  12. Dr Chelvan sought to distinguish the Upper Tribunal case  of  AMM  and
      others (conflict; humanitarian  crisis;  returnees;  FGM)  Somalia  CG
      [2011] UKUT 445 (IAC), relied on by the respondent  as  authority  for
      proposition that the legal burden was on the appellant to  prove  that
      she was  entitled  to  legal  protection.  AMM  had  referred  to  the
      respondent 'pointing to evidence regarding the general conditions'  in
      the proposed place of relocation, but in the appellant's  case,  there
      had been no assessment of the  circumstances  of  Shkod�r.   AMM  also
      predated the CJEU case of MM v Minister for Justice, Equality and  Law
      Reform, Ireland (Common European Asylum System - Directive 2004/83/EC)
      Case C-277/11, which this Tribunal cannot ignore.  MM  indicates  that
      there is a  duty  of  the  parties  to  co-operate,  as  indicated  at
      paragraphs [63] to [65]:



      "63         As is clear from its title, Article 4 of Directive 2004/83
      relates to the 'assessment of facts and circumstances'.



      64         In actual  fact,  that  'assessment'  takes  place  in  two
      separate stages. The first stage concerns the establishment of factual
      circumstances  which  may  constitute  evidence  that   supports   the
      application, while the second stage relates to the legal appraisal  of
      that evidence, which entails deciding whether, in  the  light  of  the
      specific facts of a given case, the substantive conditions  laid  down
      by Articles 9 and 10 or Article 15 of Directive 2004/83 for the  grant
      of international protection are met.


      65         Under Article 4(1) of Directive  2004/83,  although  it  is
      generally  for  the  applicant  to  submit  all  elements  needed   to
      substantiate the application, the fact remains that it is the duty  of
      the Member State to cooperate with  the  applicant  at  the  stage  of
      determining the relevant elements of that application."

  13. In the case before us, the first time that the appellant knew that she
      was expected  to  relocate  to  Shkod�r  was  when  she  received  the
      Decision.

  14.  Mr Chelvan argued that the Court of Appeal in AS (Afghanistan) v SSHD
      [2019] EWCA Civ 873 was the first occasion  when  internal  relocation
      was considered through the prism of the QD and the issue of burden  of
      proof was not addressed in that authority, so the issue of  burden  of
      proof was a novel one. Had the Court of Appeal regarded  the  case  of
      SSHD v SC [2017] Civ 2112 to be authority on the issue of  burden  and
      standard of proof, then it would have referred  to  SC.  It  did  not,
      although Dr Chelvan  accepted  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  AS  had
      referred to SC.  SC was distinguishable in any  event,  as  it  was  a
      deportation  case  considering  article  3  of  the  ECHR   alone   in
      circumstances where the appellant in that case had  not  rebutted  the
      presumption that he had been convicted of a particularly serious crime
      and constituted a danger to the  community  of  the  UK,  pursuant  to
      section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002,  so
      that he was excluded from protection under the Refugee Convention.

  15. In the context of AS being the first case to  consider  the  issue  of
      internal relocation through the prism  of  the  QD,  Dr  Chelvan  did,
      however, accept that paragraph 339O of the  Immigration  Rules,  which
      the Court of Appeal had considered in SC, transposed article 8 of  the
      QD.

      The respondent's submissions

  16. Mr Clark referred to AMM, which had expressly referred to article 8 of
      the QD.  The phrase, "shall...have regard to the... circumstances" did
      not alter the burden of proof. There was nothing in the QD  which  set
      out the  procedure  for  an  assessment  of  internal  relocation,  as
      accepted by the Upper Tribunal at paragraphs [220] to [221] of AMM.

  17. The assertion that because the Court  of  Appeal  considered  internal
      relocation the first time through the prism of  the  QD  in  AS,  this
      undermined the relevance of AMM, was not correct, as  Dr  Chelvan  had
      accepted that paragraph 339O of the Immigration Rules  had  transposed
      article 8 of the QD.

  18. Mr Clarke argued that SC is consistent with the proposition that  once
      the respondent has  identified  a  suggested  location  at  which  the
      appellant can internally relocate, then the burden is on the appellant
      then to explain why relocation to the  identified  location  would  be
      unduly harsh. The burden is on the party seeking protection  to  prove
      their entitlement.

      Discussion and conclusion on burden of proof

  19.  Whilst in an analysis of legality for  the  purposes  of  a  judicial
      review application, the lawfulness of a process might be determinative
      of an application, here, we are not concerned with the legality of the
      process by which the respondent reached its decision. Instead  we  are
      to decide whether the appellant is in need of international protection
      and, specific to this case whether the option of  internal  relocation
      can avail her in  the  light  of  the  accepted  fact  of  a  risk  of
      persecution in other parts of Albania.  The burden of proof is on  the
      appellant to  make  out  her  case;  the  respondent  has  raised  the
      availability of internal relocation in the Decision and in  accordance
      with the approach enjoined by the CA in  SC,  at  paragraphs  [33]  to
      [34]:

      "33.  The  issue  of  the  reasonableness   of   internal   relocation
      accordingly involves three separate questions:

          1. What is the location to which it is proposed the  person  could
      move?

          2. Are there real risks of serious harm  or  persecution  in  this
      place?

          3. If not, is it reasonable or not  unduly  harsh  to  expect  the
      person to relocate to this place?

      34. The first question is a factual question and the  second  question
      is an evaluation to be resolved on the basis of the evidence  accepted
      by the tribunal. There  is  no  legal  complexity  to  the  questions,
      although the tribunal should seek to  express  its  conclusions  in  a
      clear way to show that it has considered the evidence relevant to  the
      questions. The third question involves a further value judgment  based
      on  the  evidence  accepted.  On  its  face,  paragraph  339O  of  the
      Immigration Rules reflects the test laid down by the House of Lords in
      Januzi and  requires  the  decision  maker  to  consider  the  general
      circumstances prevailing in the country  concerned  and  the  personal
      circumstances of the person."

  20. We reject Dr Chelvan's submission that the burden of establishing that
      relocation to a place identified by the  respondent  would  be  unduly
      harsh rests with the respondent as a result of its duty to  cooperate,
      pursuant to the case of MM.  In our judgment,  MM  merely  confirms  a
      duty of cooperation at  the  stage  of  assessment,  for  example  the
      production of the country information reports; and does not  impose  a
      burden on the respondent or result in a formal sharing of  the  burden
      of proof.  If such a requirement was imposed a result of MM, we  would
      have expected the CJEU has said so clearly.  We do not accept that  as
      a result of MM, AMM is no longer an authority that we  should  follow.
      We refer to paragraphs [219] to [225] of AMM:

       219.     The appellants submitted that in view of Article  8  "it  is
      not for the asylum seeker to establish that he or she has no  internal
      relocation alternative. A claim must  succeed  if  the  asylum  seeker
      establishes the relevant risk unless the Tribunal is satisfied by  the
      evidence before it (a) that there is a part of the country where there
      is no relevant risk and (b) that the asylum seeker can  reasonably  be
      expected to stay there."

      220.     Mr Eicke  submitted  that  Article  8  of  the  Qualification
      Directive does not make any statement as to the procedural  mechanisms
      by which the Member State "may determine" that there  is  an  internal
      relocation alternative. Procedural rules are separately  provided  for
      under the Procedures Directive (2005/85) but no provision  in  support
      of the appellants' contention has been identified in  that  Directive.
      Furthermore, it was a general principle of European  Union  law  that,
      subject to the principles of  effectiveness  and  equivalence,  Member
      States enjoy  procedural  autonomy  enabling  them  to  lay  down  the
      detailed procedural rules applicable to the enforcement of any EU  law
      right.

      221.     That submission seems to us to be plainly right. It does not,
      however, dispose of the appellants' submissions on this  issue,  since
      they also relied upon domestic authority.

      222.     In Jasim v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2006]
      EWCA Civ 342 Sedley LJ said:-

      "[16] The possibility of internal relocation is  relevant  to  refugee
      and human rights claims because it may  demonstrate  that  a  fear  of
      persecution or harm, though warranted by the applicant's experience in
      his place of origin, is not well-founded in relation to other parts of
      the state whose duty it is to protect him. But while the two issues  -
      fear and relocation - go ultimately to the single question of  safety,
      they cannot be decided in the same breath. Once the judge of  fact  is
      satisfied that the applicant has a justified fear  of  persecution  or
      harm if returned to his home area, the claim will ordinarily  be  made
      out unless the judge is satisfied that he can nevertheless  be  safely
      returned to another part of his country of origin. Provided the second
      issue has been flagged up, there may be no formal burden of  proof  on
      the Home Secretary (see GH [2004] UKIAT 00248); but this does not mean
      that the judge of fact can  reject  an  otherwise  well-founded  claim
      unless the evidence satisfies him that internal relocation is  a  safe
      and reasonable option.

      [17] It is necessary to stress both adjectives - safe and  reasonable.
      It is well established that relocation to a safe area is not an answer
      to a claim if it is unreasonable to expect  the  applicant  to  settle
      there. There may be no work or housing. He may not speak the language.
      Similarly, relocation to an area may be perfectly reasonable by  these
      standards but unsafe, for example because of  the  risk  of  continued
      official harassment or - as in this case - revenge-seeking."

      223.     In AH (Sudan) v Secretary  of  State  [2007]  UKHL  49,  Lord
      Bingham referred to what he had said in Januzi v  Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 5:-

      "The decision-maker, taking  account  of  all  relevant  circumstances
      pertaining to the claimant and his  country  of  origin,  must  decide
      whether it is reasonable to expect the claimant to relocate or whether
      it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so... There is, as  Simon
      Brown LJ aptly observed in Svazas v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
      Department [2001] 1 WLR 1891,  para  55,  a  spectrum  of  cases.  The
      decision-maker must do his best to decide,  on  such  material  as  is
      available, where on the spectrum the particular case falls ... or must
      depend on a fair assessment of the relevant facts [5]."

      224.     In AA (Uganda) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
      [2008] EWCA Civ 579 an Immigration Judge, on the reconsideration of an
      appeal  following  an  earlier  Immigration   Judge's   determination,
      dismissed the appellant's appeal because, although  she  had  a  well-
      founded fear of persecution in a particular area of  Uganda,  she  had
      attended a particular church in the United Kingdom and the Immigration
      Judge saw "no reason why she could not also  turn  to  the  church  in
      Uganda for similar support if  the  need  arises".  That  finding  was
      categorised as perverse, not being  based  on  relevant  (indeed)  any
      evidence [12], [40] and [54].

      225.     We do not consider that the  case  law  relied  upon  by  the
      appellants comes close to establishing that the respondent  bears  the
      legal burden of proving that  there  is  a  part  of  the  country  of
      nationality of an appellant, who has established a  well-founded  fear
      in one area thereof,  to  which  the  appellant  could  reasonably  be
      expected  to  go  and  live.  The  person  who  claims   international
      protection bears the legal  burden  of  proving  that  he  or  she  is
      entitled to it. What that burden  entails  will,  however,  very  much
      depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. In practice, the
      issue of an internal relocation alternative needs to be raised by  the
      Secretary of State, either in the letter of  refusal  or  (subject  to
      issues of procedural fairness) during the  appellate  proceedings.  In
      many cases, the  respondent  will  point  to  evidence  regarding  the
      general conditions in the proposed place of relocation. It  will  then
      be for the appellant to make good an assertion  that,  notwithstanding
      those conditions, it would not be reasonable to relocate there.  Those
      reasons may often be ones about which only the appellant  could  know;
      for example, whether there are people living in the area  of  proposed
      relocation who might identify the appellant to those in his home  area
      whom he fears. The Secretary of State clearly cannot  be  expected  to
      lead evidence on such an issue."

  21. AMM  provides  a  clear  context  and  rationale  for  why,  once  the
      respondent has  identified  the  proposed  location,  it  is  for  the
      appellant to make  good  an  assertion  that  notwithstanding  general
      conditions, it would not be reasonable for  them  to  relocate  there.
      The paucity of evidence, as in  the  case  before  us,  about  general
      conditions in Shkod�r, does not alter this analysis.

  22. We do not accept that SC should be distinguished on the basis that  it
      was not referred to by the Court of Appeal in AS; or  because  it  was
      dealing with article 3  issues  in  the  context  of  deportation;  or
      because AS was the first case in which the Court of Appeal  considered
      internal relocation through the prism of the QD.

  23. We do not accept that the lack of reference in AS to SC means that the
      general guidance in SC is limited to  analysis  under  article  3,  in
      particular  when  there  was  specific   consideration   of   internal
      relocation, including by reference  to  the  well-known  authority  of
      Januzi v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2006]  UKHL  5,
      [2006] 2 AC 246.   We remind ourselves of paragraphs [36] of SC:

      "36.     I accept the  submission  that  the  evaluative  exercise  is
      intended to be holistic and that no burden or standard of proof arises
      in relation to the overall  issue  of  whether  it  is  reasonable  to
      internally relocate (see, for example Sedley LJ in Karanakaran v  SSHD
      [2000] EWCA Civ 11 at [15]  and  [20]).  That  is  distinct  from  the
      question whether there is any  evidence  upon  which  the  evaluations
      could be made. This court cannot  know  what  evidence,  if  any,  was
      provided on questions (1) and (2) and whether the tribunal accepted or
      rejected any part of that evidence in coming to a value judgment which
      is accordingly not supported by evidence. It has not been demonstrated
      to us that the conclusions of fact are inferences that could  properly
      be drawn from materials that were available. It is  accordingly  wrong
      to say that there were clear factual findings to  which  the  test  of
      reasonableness was applied or that the tribunal had sufficient factual
      material to undertake an holistic assessment for the  purpose  of  the
      third question."

  24. We conclude the burden  of  proof  remains  on  appellant,  where  the
      respondent has identified the location to which it  is  asserted  they
      could relocate, to prove why that location would be unduly  harsh,  in
      line with AMM, but within that burden, the evaluation exercise  should
      be holistic.  An holistic approach to such an assessment is consistent
      with the balance-sheet approach endorsed later  in  SC  at  paragraphs
      [40] and [41]:

      "40...  is it unduly harsh to make SC move to another place in Jamaica
      where he will be safe, rather than letting him stay  in  the  UK?  The
      phrase 'unduly harsh' imports a value judgment of what is 'due' to the
      person. It is possible to postulate that what may be an  unduly  harsh
      consequence for one person may not be an unduly harsh consequence  for
      another person where the latter is a person who represents a danger to
      the community because he has committed serious offences. This  is  not
      to allow public interest  considerations  to  infringe  human  rights;
      there would be no infringement of article 3 in the new location. I  am
      accordingly  persuaded  that  SC's  criminality   should   have   been
      considered and it was not.

      41. Does this analysis vitiate the finding of the  FtT?  The  tribunal
      did not expressly weigh SC's criminal activity in  the  balance  (see,
      for example the judgment at [38]), although the judgment  is  informed
      by the tribunal's view of SC's criminal conduct  and,  ultimately,  by
      the conclusion that the traumatic experiences of  SC's  childhood  are
      partially to blame and that he can be  rehabilitated.   The  UT  found
      that  some  of  the  factors  considered  by  the  FtT  in   assessing
      reasonableness (including criminality) were implicit but that  is  not
      in itself a satisfactory conclusion. It is  accordingly  unclear  what
      the tribunal weighed in the balance.  The FtT would have  been  better
      advised  to  structure  the  consideration  of   internal   relocation
      differently. A useful structure would  be  to  list  all  the  factors
      pointing towards internal relocation being unduly harsh and then  list
      those factors pointing against internal relocation being unduly harsh.
      A paragraph  should  follow  which  explains  the  balancing  exercise
      undertaken, the conclusion and the reasons for  the  conclusion.  This
      kind of balance sheet approach has become a commonplace  in  questions
      of this kind and might usefully  be  adopted  by  the  FtT  when  this
      question arises."

  25. Setting aside the issue of criminality, which is not relevant in  this
      appeal,  we  followed  a  balance-sheet  approach  in   the   holistic
      assessment.  An over-emphasis on the overall burden of proof can be  a
      distraction from that holistic assessment.

  26. The appellant's final assertion fails as a result of the fact that the
      QD has been accurately transposed by paragraph 339O of the Immigration
      Rules.

  27. The findings preserved relate to the following.  The  appellant  is  a
      bisexual woman who was at risk, as a result of  her  sexual  identity,
      from her father, in four identified locations already referred  to  in
      this decision. Her father had been abusive to both the  appellant  and
      members of her family. There had been a finding that domestic violence
      was widespread in Albania, with societal discrimination to the  extent
      that it was said that the appellant might choose to  keep  her  sexual
      identity secret, even if she were not at risk from her father or other
      family members in Shkod�r.

  28. Although the appellant was not called to give evidence in the  context
      of Dr Chelvan's submission  that  the  burden  of  proof  was  on  the
      respondent, he stated that the appellant  would  not  open  about  her
      sexual identity in Albania; and that she would not have any difficulty
      in obtaining employment or housing.  Her concealment meant that,  when
      considering whether she could lead a 'relatively normal  life',  which
      was a consideration in AS, (paragraph [31]), the answer was  that  she
      could not, but would instead be forced  to  live  a  'half-life.'   In
      particular, the appellant would be unable to develop  a  private  life
      with friends. She would be returning as a lone  woman  without  family
      connections, seeking to integrate into a society in  which  there  was
      discrimination against people based their sexual identity.  The  FTT's
      findings about the appellant's mental  health  combined  to  make  her
      internal relocation to Shkod�r unduly harsh.

  29. For the purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration  Rules,
      and whether there were very significant obstacles to  the  appellant's
      integration into Albania, once again the starting point was  that  she
      was a single woman who would be returning to  Albania  without  family
      connections, where there was societal discrimination and where she had
      never lived openly as a bisexual woman.  The authority of BF, relating
      as it  did  to  gay  men,  was  of  limited  assistance,  as  was  the
      respondent's most recent Country Policy and Information Note  ('CPIN')
      - Albania: Sexual orientation and gender identity (April 2019).  While
      Dr Chelvan objected to its admission as new evidence, he  was  content
      to deal with it in submissions, noting that the only  additions  since
      the last version of the CPIN (version 4) which had been considered  by
      the FTT, were as a result of BF, which it was open to us to consider.

      The respondent's submissions

  30. As a starting point, Mr Clarke submitted that societal  discrimination
      within Albania did not amount to  societal  persecution.   Whilst  the
      appellant said that she would feel  compelled  not  to  disclose  this
      aspect of her identity as a result of shame and fear; in  relation  to
      obtaining employment and housing, the need to disclose or discuss  her
      sexual identity would never arise; and in relation to friendships  and
      social networks, the appellant was hardly likely to  disclose  aspects
      of her identity to those who did not  share  a  common  acceptance  of
      those aspects. In essence, she would be choosing not  to  share  those
      aspects of her life, in circumstances where she  would  not  otherwise
      naturally have done so, rather than being compelled to conceal aspects
      of her identity.

  31. In terms of the appellant's personal circumstances, while she had been
      kicked out by her family, there was no further  detail,  in  terms  of
      evidence about her claim to be compelled not to  disclose  aspects  of
      her identity;  there  was  no  updated  medical  evidence  beyond  the
      evidence provided to the FTT in July  2017;  no  evidence  about  what
      friendships in  Albania  had  been  retained  and  what  not;  and  no
      evidence, beyond a bare assertion, that she would  feel  compelled  to
      live almost as a recluse in Albania.

  32. Considering the wider objective evidence, the respondent had  referred
      to the  2019  CPIN  to  assist  the  appellant  -  in  fact,  what  it
      demonstrated, as did  BF,  was  the  paucity  of  any  evidence  about
      prevailing country or regional circumstances for women, as opposed  to
      gay or bisexual men in Albania. In essence, there was simply a  dearth
      of evidence; either in relation to whether it would be unduly harsh to
      relocate; or by reference to the test under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) or
      article 8, which Dr Chelvan accepted was a different,  more  difficult
      test for the appellant to satisfy, as to any obstacles, let alone very
      significant ones, to the appellant's integration in Albania.

      Discussion and conclusions on internal  relocation  and  obstacles  to
      integration

  33. The appellant has relied only on the evidence before the FTT  in  July
      2017, nearly 2 years ago, despite being aware since November 2018 that
      this Tribunal would remake the decision and that in doing so, she  was
      able  to  apply  to  adduce  whatever  additional  relevant  evidence,
      particularly more up-to-date evidence, she wished.  Instead,  she  has
      relied upon the narrow legal point about where  the  burden  of  proof
      lies in seeking to argue that as the respondent has the  burden  which
      it has not discharged, that internal relocation  to  Shkod�r  must  be
      unduly harsh. As we have already indicated, we reject the  appellant's
      submissions on the burden of proof, so that we are left  with  limited
      evidence on which to make the assessment, albeit we have  done  so  as
      best we can using a holistic  approach,  within  the  framework  of  a
      'balance sheet' analysis.

  34. Focusing on the appellant's personal circumstances, she will be a lone
      woman relocating to a city, Shkod�r, with which she is  not  familiar;
      without family connections, being estranged from her  family;  fearing
      her father and with, at best, only telephone contact with  her  mother
      (as recorded in her evidence at paragraph [11] of the FTT decision).

  35.  Beyond  that,   the   evidence   about   the   appellant's   personal
      circumstances, which are relevant to the issue of whether it would  be
      unduly harsh for her to relocate to  Shkod�r,  is  extremely  limited.
      Her  written  witness  statement  for  the  FTT  includes  four  brief
      paragraphs on the inability to internally relocate (pages [88] to [89]
      of the appellant's bundle).  She recites her fear that her father will
      attempt to find and kill her. The FTT has already rejected the ability
      of the appellant's father to locate her  outside  the  four  specified
      cities in Albania ([31] of the FTT decision). She further asserts that
      she could not be open about her sexuality.  The FTT  also  found  that
      the appellant would be able to find employment, specifically as a shop
      worker.  Dr Chelvan does not dispute that she would also  be  able  to
      obtain accommodation, and we find that with an ability to  find  work,
      she would be able to find accommodation in Shkod�r.

  36. Another facet of the issue of whether relocation to Shkod�r  would  be
      unduly harsh is the appellant's ability to establish friendship groups
      and social networks.  We considered whether the appellant's history of
      localised persecution from her  father  (who  would  not  be  able  to
      persecute her in Shkod�r); her depression  or  any  associated  mental
      health issues; or societal attitudes more generally would  hinder  her
      ability to do so.

  37. Dealing with the connected issues of past, localised, persecution, and
      depression, we have considered  the  expert  report  of  a  consultant
      psychiatrist, dated 22 June  2017,  at  pages  [71]  to  [82]  of  the
      appellant's bundle.  The expertise of the consultant is  unchallenged.
      While brief, the report describes the appellant as  suffering  from  a
      depressive   episode,   with   fleeting   suicidal   thoughts;    poor
      concentration; anxiety; low mood; disturbed  sleep;  an  inability  to
      enjoy life; and a  fear  for  the  future  ([75]  of  the  appellant's
      bundle). The report makes a number of other brief points: first,  that
      with antidepressants with which the appellant  was  being  treated  in
      June 2017, and further  psychological  treatment,  the  appellant  was
      likely to recover with a period  of  a  year  from  the  date  of  the
      examination i.e. her recovery would be complete by  20  June  2018,  a
      year ago ([76] of the appellant's bundle).  Second, her condition  was
      likely to get worse if  she  were  deported  to  Albania  against  her
      wishes, as she has an understandable fear of returning there; with  an
      increased risk of suicide because she is terrified of her  father  and
      other members of her family.

  38. The author of the report  did  not  consider  the  issue  of  internal
      relocation  to  another  part  of  Albania,  where,  objectively,  the
      appellant would not be at risk of adverse  attention  from  relatives,
      and in the context  of  the  appellant  having  found  employment  and
      accommodation. There is no update on the appellant's  current  medical
      condition, and we can only assume that  she  has  recovered  from  her
      depressive episode, given the prognosis of recovery within a year. Any
      risk of recurrence of mental illness, associated with her fear of  her
      father and cousins, must be considered in the context of that recovery
      and internal relocation to somewhere objectively beyond the  reach  of
      her father and cousins.   There is no evidence that after a period  of
      recovery, the appellant would continue to suffer a subjective fear (as
      opposed to objectively justified fear) of  discovery  by  her  father,
      which would result in further illness.

  39. We have also considered the impact of  wider  societal  discrimination
      against bisexual women in Albania; to what extent, if  any,  it  would
      impact on the appellant's  ability  to  form  friendships  and  social
      networks, given her history of depression.     We remind ourselves  of
      the Country Guidance case  of  BF.  We  accept  the  submission  that,
      relating as it did to the prevailing  circumstances  for  gay  men  in
      Albania, it was of limited assistance to the question  of  whether  it
      was  unduly  harsh  for  bisexual  woman   to   return   to   Albania.
      Nevertheless, it recited, at paragraph [2], the only (limited) general
      Country  Guidance  case  of  direct  relevance,  IM  (Risk,  Objective
      Evidence, Homosexuals) Albania CG [2003] UKIAT 00067:

      "The existing  country  guidance  is  IM  (Risk,  Objective  Evidence,
      Homosexuals) Albania  CG  [2003]  UKIAT  00067  ("IM")  which  can  be
      summarised as follows:

      (i) Other than two incidents in  1994  and  200     1,  there  was  no
      evidence to suggest that there is generalised treatment of homosexuals
      in Albania which is of a persecutory nature  or  in  breach  of  their
      human rights ([5]);

      (ii) Equally, there is no evidence apart from  a  single  incident  in
      1994 that homosexuals in Albania are treated adversely by  the  police
      although there is evidence that those detained and arrested by  police
      on suspicion of criminal activity may be ill-treated ([5] and [6]);

      (iii)  There  is  therefore  "no  country  background  evidence  which
      supports a reasonable likelihood that homosexuals as such  in  Albania
      are subject to any action on the part either of the  populace  or  the
      authorities which would amount to persecution for the purposes of  the
      Refugee Convention or would be in  breach  of  their  protected  human
      rights."

  40. We also considered the Country Guidance case of TD and AD  (Trafficked
      women) CG [2016] UKUT 00092 (IAC), and in particular, paragraph [111]:

      "111.      As  to  the  social  consequences  of  a  past  trafficking
      experience we note the findings in AM & BM about social  exclusion  of
      women labelled as kurva, in the context of the  tenacity  of  Northern
      Albanian traditions. It might be thought that the increased  migration
      from the countryside to the cities might lead to a weakening  in  such
      belief systems, as extended families leave the  land  and  break  down
      into smaller, more independent units. Surprisingly we  were  shown  no
      evidence to that effect, and in fact it  was  suggested  by  Professor
      Haxhiymeri that such migration - primarily from North to South  -  has
      had the opposite effect, of transporting conservative Geg social mores
      into the more liberal south. The importance of the family  unit  as  a
      social and economic construct  was  emphasised  in  all  the  evidence
      before us. We accept her evidence that women living on their  own  are
      immediately identifiable as  being  on  the  'outside';  even  if  the
      details of their history are not known, work colleagues and neighbours
      may view them with some suspicion. In some cases that  suspicion  will
      escalate to open prejudice and hostility. We therefore find no  reason
      to depart from the general conclusions on this  matter  drawn  by  the
      Tribunal in AM & BM. Women living  on  their  own  are  likely  to  be
      socially distinct. Whilst discrimination and  stigma  certainly  exist
      they will not  generally  constitute  persecutory  "serious  harm"  or
      breach Article 3, but this it nevertheless a factor to  be  considered
      cumulatively when assessing whether internal flight is reasonable  for
      any given appellant."

  41.  We find that, being  situated  in  the  north  of  the  country,  the
      appellant's relocation to Shkod�r could result  in  at  least  initial
      suspicion on her return there (noting TD), and the 2019  CPIN  refers,
      at section 5 ('societal treatment and attitudes') to LGBTI individuals
      continuing to experience discrimination. While the CPIN reported there
      to have been a drastic change since 2010 and the adoption  of  a  non-
      discrimination law in Albania, homophobic sentiments remain very  high
      (as evidenced in a survey conducted by  a  US-based  NGO,  albeit  its
      sample size, sample location and general methodology is unclear).

  42. On the basis of the  limited  evidence  before  us,  noting  that  the
      appellant had not been called to give evidence, and had not sought  to
      produce any updated witness statement, we proceeded on the  assumption
      that the appellant would, on relocation, be viewed with some suspicion
      and curiosity and may even be the target of  homophobic,  non-physical
      abuse, by non-state actors, as a  result,  although  even  this  is  a
      tentative assumption, based on the limited information we  have  about
      the survey samples and methodology referred to in  section  5  of  the
      CPIN.    However, we find that there is simply  insufficient  evidence
      to conclude that even faced with that  level  of  discrimination,  the
      appellant would not be able to avail herself of state protection,  for
      example from  local  police,  in  the  event  that  she  suffers  from
      harassment, noting the CPIN's analysis of protection at section  2.4.3
      of the CPIN, which discusses the implementation of legislation against
      hate crimes:

      "2.4.3 Where the person's fear is of persecution or  serious  harm  by
      non-state actors (including rogue state actors), there is, in general,
      protection in law and avenues of redress, although  the  situation  in
      areas  outside  Tirana  must  be  considered  carefully  and  on   the
      particular evidence presented. Anti- discrimination  laws  in  Albania
      expressly protect  LGBT  persons  and  make  hate  crimes  a  criminal
      offence. As mentioned above the Albanian government has passed some of
      the most progressive LGBT laws in the region"

  43.  While we were  conscious  that  the  appellant  would  be  relocating
      outside Tirana, there was no evidence that the authorities in  Shkod�r
      would be unwilling or unable to assist.

  44. We also  accept  the  respondent's  submission  that  the  appellant's
      potential ability to establish social networks and  friendship  groups
      with people in Shkod�r who would be accepting of  her  bisexuality  is
      likely  to  be  transformed  by  social  media,  and  that  this  will
      significantly mitigate the risks of her isolation.  Put  another  way,
      the ability to  reach  out  to  others,  while  resettling  in  a  new
      location, goes to answer, at least in part, the  question  of  whether
      the appellant would feel compelled to live in  social  isolation.   We
      find that the appellant's ability to  establish  social  networks  and
      friendship groups; to access police assistance,  if  needed;  and  her
      ability  to  access  housing  and  employment,  are  all   significant
      mitigating  factors  in  considering  the   appellant's   history   of
      depression and the extent to which she might be isolated as a result.

      Conclusion on internal relocation

  45. Adopting the balance-sheet approach as part of an holistic assessment,
      we have referred already,  on  the  one-hand,  to  societal  attitudes
      towards same sex relationships, albeit not beyond the level of a risk,
      to the lower standard, of non-physical harassment;  initial  suspicion
      and curiosity; the fact that the  appellant  would  be  relocating  to
      Shkod�r, a location with which she was not familiar; and  her  history
      of depression and fear of past ill-treatment.  On the other  hand,  we
      take account of the appellant's undisputed ability to  access  housing
      and get a job; and establish friendship groups and social networks; as
      well her recovery from depression and lack of evidence  of  recurrence
      of that condition; and access to police assistance, if necessary.

  46. Based on the very limited evidence  presented  by  the  appellant,  we
      conclude that her internal relocation to Shkod�r would not  be  unduly
      harsh. The personal support that the appellant  could  access  through
      friendship groups and networks, in the setting of access to  work  and
      accommodation  would  ultimately  outweigh  the  challenges  of  wider
      societal attitudes and initial curiosity or suspicion.  In short,  the
      appellant would not be faced with the option of living as a recluse or
      living some kind of  'half-life'  as  the  only  means  of  living  in
      Shkod�r.  In the circumstances, her  relocation  there  would  not  be
      unduly harsh, even if she  felt  unable,  because  of  wider  societal
      attitudes, to be open about her sexual identity.

  47. For the same reasons, the obstacles to the appellant's integration  in
      Shkod�r, of societal attitudes towards same sex relationships, initial
      suspicion and curiosity; and the appellant's history of depression and
      her fear of past ill-treatment, would  not  be  very  significant,  in
      light of the mitigating factors  which  would  mitigate  her  risk  of
      social isolation and her ability to integrate into life in Shkod�r.

  48. In the light of our finding that it would not be unduly harsh for  the
      appellant to internally  relocate  to  Shkod�r,  and  the  absence  of
      evidence that she would not be at  unprotected  risk,  the  protection
      claim must fail.

  49. Similarly, in  light  of  the  appellant's  ability  to  integrate  in
      Shkod�r, the appellant does not meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
      276ADE(1)(vi) of the  Immigration  Rules,  for  the  purposes  of  her
      private life.  The FTT had carried out an article 8 assessment of  the
      appellant's private life, outside the Immigration Rules,  at  [57]  to
      [61] of its decision.  We adopt that part of the FTT's  analysis  (not
      the overall decision), noting that when considering  the  question  of
      proportionality, the mitigating  factors  which  reduce  the  risk  of
      social isolation, already outlined above, are an important  weight  in
      the proportionality of the respondent's decision to  refuse  leave  to

    Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
    As this case involves a protection claim I make an order whereby unless
    and until a Tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
    granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings  shall  directly  or
    indirectly identify her.  This direction applies both to the  appellant
    and to the respondent.  Failure to comply  with  this  direction  could
    lead to contempt of court proceedings.


                                                   DECISION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant has been granted permission on five  grounds  challenging
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bartlett  who  dismissed  the
    appeal by the appellant, a national of Albania against the Secretary of
    State's decision dated 10 April 2017 refusing her asylum claim based on
    her accepted bisexuality and the consequent hostility from  her  father
    who had threatened to kill her.

 2. The appellant had left Albania in February 2017 after a period of study
    at the University in Tirana.  She reached the United Kingdom  in  March
    that year.

 3. The Secretary of State considered that protection was available to  the
    appellant by the authorities and,  furthermore,  also  considered  that
    internal relocation was available as the fear was confined to specified
    areas in Albania, including Tirana, Durres and other locations  in  the
    south of the country where the  appellant  had  been  raised.   It  was
    considered that it would not  be  unreasonable  for  the  appellant  to
    relocate to Shkoder or another location in Albania.   Furthermore,  the
    Secretary of State considered that paragraph  276  of  the  Immigration
    Rules was not made out and there would be no breach of Article 8.

 4. In  reaching  his  conclusions,  the  judge  accepted  the  appellant's
    sexuality and, in respect of his other findings, rejected the Secretary
    of State's claim that Section 8 of the 2004 Act applied.  It  had  been
    asserted the appellant had not  claimed  asylum  immediately  upon  her
    arrival in the United Kingdom.

 5. The judge reached the following further conclusions at paragraph 30  of
    his decision:

         "I accept that the appellant's father was abusive  to  her  mother,
         the appellant and her siblings.  I find the appellant  credible  in
         this regard and this is supported by the medical  report.   I  find
         that domestic violence is widespread in  Albania  and  a  statistic
         often cited is that one in  3  women  in  Albania  will  experience
         domestic violence."

    He continued:

         "I find that the appellant's account that her father would wish  to
         do her harm is consistent with  Albania  suffering  from  pervasive
         domestic violence and  patriarchal  attitudes  about  ownership  of
         women.  Therefore I find that the appellant is at risk  of  serious
         harm from her father and  that  this  amounts  to  persecution.   I
         accept that the appellant is extremely scared  of  her  father.   I
         consider that this  may  have  influenced  her  view  so  that  her
         subjective fears are greater than  objective  reality.   I  do  not
         accept that the appellant is at risk of harm from her cousins."

    And at paragraph 31:

         "I do not accept that the  appellant's  father  has  the  power  or
         resources to seek the appellant throughout Albania.  The  appellant
         has not provided evidence to establish that he is a rich man  or  a
         man with any connections to the police, organised criminals or  any
         others with influence and power who  could  pursue  her  throughout
         Albania.  Therefore I considered that the  risk  of  the  appellant
         facing harm at the hands of her father arises where he  is  located
         which is Gjirokaster.  I accept that she has family in other  parts
         of Albania comprising  Tirana,  Tepelele,  Durres  and  Volore.   I
         accept that these  family  members  might  inform  the  appellant's
         father that they knew where she  was  if  this  was  the  case  and
         therefore the appellant cannot relocate to those areas.  However  I
         must consider whether she  can  internally  relocate  elsewhere  in
         Albania."

 6. The judge then proceeded to consider the treatment of LGBT  individuals
    by Albanian society and reached this conclusion at paragraph 39 of  his
    decision:

         "Taking all of this into account and the objective evidence set out
         in the appellant's bundle I conclude that the situation in  Albania
         is one  where  there  is  widespread  discrimination  and  societal
         disapproval of bisexuals.  I do not accept  that  this  amounts  to
         persecution."

    And at paragraph 40:

         "Therefore the appellant would  not  be  required  to  conceal  her
         sexuality as a result of fears of persecution; her family is  aware
         so there can be no concealment and wider society would  not  punish
         her.  Instead she would conceal it because of feelings of shame and
         concerns about suffering prejudice and discrimination."

 7. The judge then turned to consideration of sufficiency of protection and
    concluded at paragraph 45:

         "I find that the background information provided by  the  appellant
         sets  out  that  the  police  have  provided  protection  to   LGBT
         individuals in numerous instances, it also identifies that in  some
         instances they have failed to provide protection.  The ILGA: Europe
         report itself identifies 10 cases in 2012 and in most  cases  where
         hate crimes against LGBT individuals were reported  to  the  police
         some action  was  taken.   Therefore  I  do  not  accept  that  the
         appellant has established even to the lower standard of proof  that
         the state authorities would  be  unable  or  unwilling  to  provide
         sufficient protection."

    And as to internal relocation at paragraph 46:

         "... she may keep her sexuality a secret from employers,  landlords
         and friends.  I consider that this does not of itself make internal
         relocation unduly  harsh  for  the  appellant.   The  appellant  is
         clearly a bright young woman, she was studying at Tirana University
         before she abandoned her degree.  I recognise that she  has  little
         employment history.  However I consider that she would be  able  to
         study for another degree at a different university in Albania  away
         from where her family is located.  In addition  I  considered  that
         she would be able to find work such as shop work without having any
         family connections."

 8. In considering whether it would be unduly harsh for  the  appellant  to
    relocate, the judge failed to indicate the destination he had in  mind,
    an aspect candidly acknowledged by Mr Lindsay in his submissions.   The
    judge therefore considered  this  aspect  in  a  vacuum.   He  did  not
    identify which university the appellant might attend or the city  where
    it might be.  No reasons were given why the judge  concluded  that  the
    discrimination and the disapproval which might lead  the  appellant  to
    keep her sexuality secret would not be unduly harsh.  The question  the
    judge should have asked, once the destination  was  decided  upon,  was
    whether it would be reasonable for her to live in  such  a  place  that
    might  require  her  to  keep  her  sexuality  secret  from  landlords,
    employers and friends.  This would need to be considered in the context
    of her mental health in respect of which the judge  was  satisfied  the
    appellant  was  depressed.   We  find  this  failure  to  give  reasons
    sufficient for the decision to be set aside and for it to be remade.

 9. The findings of fact by the judge are to be preserved as  to  the  risk
    faced by the appellant from her father and the reach of that risk to be
    identified by locations which we have referred to above.   Accordingly,
    we are satisfied that ground 2 is  made  out  to  the  extent  that  it
    challenges the lawfulness of the conclusions  on  internal  relocation.
    There is therefore no need to consider the remaining grounds.   We  now
    give directions for the remaking of this decision.

10. In our view this decision can be properly remade in the Upper  Tribunal
    in the light of the findings that have been  preserved.   We  are  also
    aware as indeed are Mr Lindsay and Mr Chelvan that there is  a  pending
    Country Guidance case on the situation for LGBT individuals in  Albania
    which is listed for hearing on 24 October.  The case will be listed for
    hearing decision once that guidance is published.
