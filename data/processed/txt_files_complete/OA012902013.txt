Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Walker, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms F Allen, Counsel instructed by CNA Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   In this determination I shall refer to Mrs Jamac as  the  claimant  and
    to the Appellant as the ECO.

2.   The claimant, a national of Somalia, date  of  birth  9  January  1982,
    applied for entry clearance as a partner under  the  Immigration  Rules
    which was refused by the ECO on 14 November 2012.   An  appeal  against
    that decision came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  R  Chowdhury  (the
    judge) who on 9 October 2012 dismissed the appeal with reference to the
    Immigration Rules but allowed the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.

3.   The ECO applied for permission to appeal which was  granted  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Colyer on 16 January 2014.

4.   On 6 March 2014 for reasons which were given in writing, dated 2  April
    2014, I found that the judge had made an error of  law  in  respect  of
    dealing with the issues arising under Article 8 of the  ECHR.   At  the
    hearing before me Ms Allen in the light of information that had  become
    clear sought permission to  raise  a  cross-challenge  to  the  judge's
    decision under the Immigration  Rules.  Absent  of  objection  from  Mr
    Walker,   I decided her application should be allowed because, although
    it could have been raised at an earlier time, there was no prejudice to
    the ECO : The very information relied upon  by  Ms  Allen  was  in  the
    evidence, before the ECO, at the material time.   Therefore  the  Judge
    made a mistake made of fact which amounted to an error of  law  in  the
    judge's decision.

5.   In the circumstances, Ms Allen properly submits, by  reference  to  the
    contemporary documentation and information, which related back  to  the
    date of the Respondent's decision, the evidence showed the Sponsor  was
    able to show that he met the necessary financial threshold  of  �18,600
    at the date of the ECO's decision.  The evidence, referred  to  in  the
    decision of the judge, indicated two forms of employment, one of  which
    had been probationary but had become full-time, and that  the  combined
    totals of employment as demonstrated by payslips  and  P60s  showed  in
    excess of the �18,600 requirement.

6.   It is apparent, I accept what Ms Allen  also  says  about  the  matter,
    that she raised the issue of the Sponsor's two employments. It  appears
    that some of the judge's consideration of the evidence got  sidetracked
    by the absence of a relevant P60, for the point was  forgotten  by  the
    judge in the determination. The judge reached the erroneous  conclusion
    that at the date of the Respondent's  decision  the  combined  earnings
    were �18,242 odd and below the required threshold.  There was no  other
    basis to dismiss the appeal and in the circumstances it is  unfortunate
    that the point had not been picked up in the First-tier Tribunal.

7.   The original Tribunal cannot stand and it was agreed that the  decision
    should be remade, on the submissions made to me.

8.   On the unchallenged evidence in being at the date of  the  Respondent's
    decision ,I find, each relevant requirement of  paragraph  281  of  the
    Rules was met.  In those circumstances it is also said that there is no
    need to consider the issues of proportionality  under  Article  8  with
    reference to the earnings because quite  simply  the  matter  has  been
    settled under the Rules.  It is to be noted that the combined position,
    on behalf of the representatives before  me,  was  that  that  was  the
    established position at the date of the Respondent's decision.

9.       The following decision is substituted. The appeal by  the  Claimant
    is allowed

ANONYMITY ORDER
No anonymity order was made and none has been requested nor did it  seem  to
be necessary or appropriate to do so.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD
Since I have been remaking the decision I have also considered the issue  of
whether a fees award was appropriate.  In the circumstances  of  the  appeal
when the documentation was provided it seems to me  appropriate  to  make  a
fee award in the sum  of  �140  in  favour  of  the  Appellant  because  the
material was before the ECO  and it was in being at the date  of  the  ECO's
decision.

Signed                                  Date 24 June 2014
