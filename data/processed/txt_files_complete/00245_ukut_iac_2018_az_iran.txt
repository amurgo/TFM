Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr K Smyth, Kesar & Co Solicitors


(1) Before it has re-made the decision in an  appeal,  pursuant  to  section
12(2)(b)(ii) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act  2007,  the  Upper
Tribunal has jurisdiction to depart from, or vary,  its  decision  that  the
First-tier  Tribunal  made  an  error  of  law,  such  that  the  First-tier
Tribunal's decision should be set aside under section 12(2)(a).

(2) As Practice Direction 3.7 indicates, that  jurisdiction  will,  however,
be exercised only in very exceptional cases. This will  be  so,  whether  or
not the same constitution of the Upper Tribunal that made the error  of  law
decision is re-making the decision in the appeal.

(3) Permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  should  be  granted  on  a
ground that was not advanced by an applicant for permission, only if:

   (a) the judge is satisfied that the ground he or she has  identified  is
   one which has a strong prospect of success:


      (i) for the original appellant; or


      (ii) for the Secretary  of  State,  where  the  ground  relates  to  a
      decision which, if undisturbed,  would  breach  the  United  Kingdom's
      international Treaty obligations; or


   (b) (possibly) the ground relates to an  issue  of  general  importance,
   which the Upper Tribunal needs to address.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This case:

      a) concerns the correct  approach  to  be  taken  to  "error  of  law"
         decisions of  the  Upper  Tribunal,  where  the  re-making  of  the
         decision under appeal is to be undertaken by that Tribunal; and

    (b)   is an example of the difficulties that can arise when  permission
         to appeal is granted on a ground which  was  not  advanced  by  the
         applicant for permission.



A. The claimant's case

 2. The respondent (hereafter claimant) is a citizen of Iran, who was  born
    in January 1997.  He is an ethnic Kurd.  The claimant's father was said
    by the claimant to be involved politically in  what  the  claimant  now
    believed to be the KDPI Party.

 3. When the claimant was 8 years old, his parents  took  him  to  live  in
    Iraqi Kurdistan, where he was educated.

 4. More recently,  the  claimant's  father,  according  to  the  claimant,
    travelled to Iran for a week, on what the claimant thought was  a  trip
    in order to arrange accommodation for the  family  to  return  to  that
    country.  On reappearing in Iraq, however, the claimant's father showed
    the claimant a piece of paper which, according to what the claimant  is
    recorded as saying at interview, was an Iranian arrest warrant.

 5. The claimant concluded that his father must have been  working  for  an
    organisation that was opposed to the Iranian regime.   So,  instead  of
    returning to Iran, the family went by  train  and  later  by  lorry  to
    Europe.  The claimant travelled in a separate  lorry  to  that  of  his
    parents and found himself in  the  United  Kingdom,  where  he  claimed
    asylum.

 6. The basis of the claimant's case  was  that  he  believed  the  Iranian
    government would arrest him as the son of a person  who  had  run  away
    from that country.

 7. The Secretary of State rejected the claim.  Amongst other  things,  the
    Secretary of State considered that it was not believable that an arrest
    warrant from Iran would have been given to the claimant's father by the
    Iranian authorities.  Overall, the Secretary of State  considered  that
    the claimant could safely be returned to Iran.



B. The appeal before Judge Dineen

 8. The claimant appealed against that decision to the First-tier Tribunal.
     On 20 August 2015, his appeal was heard at Hatton Cross by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Dineen.

 9. Judge Dineen's decision was promulgated on 13 April 2016.  At paragraph
    41 of his decision, the judge said:  "I  regret  the  delay  which  has
    occurred in finalising this decision, which has been due to pressure of
    work in the  Tribunal".   The  judge  nevertheless  said  that  he  had
    "carefully considered all the evidence  and  submissions  made  in  the
    appeal both at and immediately following the hearing and in the  period
    since then".  At paragraphs 42 to 47 of his decision, the judge set out
    the reasons why he was not satisfied, on the lower standard  of  proof,
    that the claimant's father had been involved in activities against  the
    Iranian regime, as the claimant had suggested.

10. At paragraph 42, the judge found that the  claimant's  father  had  not
    been in possession of an Iranian arrest warrant, as had  been  claimed.
    This was because of  the  fact  that  the  evidence  relating  to  such
    warrants, referred to in paragraph 27 of the refusal  letter,  rendered
    it incredible that the Iranian authorities would give the subject of  a
    warrant a copy of it prior to arresting him "thus making  it  clear  to
    him that he should abscond".

11. At paragraph 43,  the  judge  found  that  the  claimant's  father  had
    returned to a Kurdish area of Iraq and there was no evidence to suggest
    the Iranian authorities could execute a warrant against him there.   In
    general, the judge was not satisfied that flight from  Iraq  to  Europe
    "would have been necessary to avoid the consequences of such a warrant"
    (paragraph 43).

12. At paragraph 44, the  judge  found  that,  since  the  details  of  any
    involvement of the claimant's father in the activities of the KDPI  had
    not been communicated to the claimant, the judge was not satisfied that
    the claimant's mother would have told the  claimant  that  people  they
    regularly visited were involved in the activities of that organisation.



13. The accounts given by the claimant of visits by the KDPI to the  family
    home and of evenings away from the home spent by the claimant's father,
    were not, the judge  said,  specifically  linked  to  any  evidence  of
    political activity and were consistent with  many  other  explanations,
    including social activities by the claimant's father.

14. At paragraph 46, the judge found he could not be satisfied that if  the
    claimant's father had been involved in KDPI activity, the latter  would
    have returned to Iran with the intention of making arrangements for his
    wife and child to move back there with him.

15. Having made those findings, the judge turned,  beginning  at  paragraph
    48, to the issue of risk  on  return.   The  judge  said  that  he  had
    considered the country guidance  decision  in  SB  (Risk  on  return  -
    illegal exit) Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 00053.  According to the judge, that
    decision indicated that "there would be no risk to  an  asylum  seeking
    person returning to Iran merely on account of  being  a  failed  asylum
    seeker, unless there were a further risk factor  such  as  having  been
    involved in criminal proceedings in Iran before leaving".

16. At paragraph 50,  however,  the  judge  noted  a  report  from  Amnesty
    International, mentioned in the Secretary of  State's  refusal  letter,
    that asylum seekers were "interrogated on return, whether or  not  they
    have been political activists in Iran or abroad".  At paragraph 51, the
    judge found that it must be "highly likely that the appellant would  be
    asked whether he had applied for asylum in the UK, and what grounds  he
    had given for seeking asylum".  Assuming  that  the  claimant  must  be
    expected  to  respond  truthfully,  "this   would,   perhaps   somewhat
    paradoxically, mean that he would, regardless  of  the  truth  of  such
    claim, have to state that he had claimed that his  father  was  a  KDPI
    activist".

17. According to the judge, this was sufficient to put the claimant at real
    risk.  The judge accordingly allowed the claimant's  appeal  on  asylum
    and human rights grounds.



         C. The grant by Judge Holmes of permission to appeal

18.  The  Secretary  of  State  applied  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
    permission to appeal against Judge Dineen's decision.  The Secretary of
    State submitted that the facts of the claimant's account, as  found  by
    the judge, fell "squarely within the country guidance case law" of  SB.
    According to the Secretary of State, there were no further risk factors
    advanced by the claimant.  The Secretary of State  submitted  that,  on
    the judge's reasoning, "all failed asylum seekers would be at  risk  on
    return as by the very nature of them attempting to obtain refuge in the
    UK or any other country, the account they would advance  would  be  one
    which would contain an element  that  placed  them  at  risk  from  the
    Iranian authorities if it was discovered".

19. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes on
    4 May 2016.  At paragraph  3,  Judge  Holmes  considered  that  it  was
    arguable  Judge  Dineen  had  failed  to  follow  the  current  country
    guidance, without giving any adequate reasons for departing from it.

20. However, at paragraph 2, Judge Holmes raised,  of  his  own  accord,  a
    ground which had not featured in the Secretary of  State's  application
    for permission:-

         "2.  There appears to have been a very substantial, and unexplained
             delay in preparing the decision upon the appeal of some  eight
             months, which gives rise to legitimate concern as  to  whether
             the parties received a fair hearing of the appeal,  since  the
             Judge could not be expected to retain a proper level of recall
             of the oral evidence after four months (sic); Mario [1998] Imm
             AR 281 and Sambasivam [1999] IATRF 1999/0419/4."

21. Both sides accept  (and  we  agree)  that  Judge  Holmes'  decision  on
    permission was to grant permission to appeal on those two grounds.   As
    we shall see, it is the ground Judge Holmes raised of his own  volition
    that has led to this case going to the Court of Appeal and back to  the
    Upper Tribunal.




    D. The proceedings before Judge Hutchinson in the Upper Tribunal

22. In a written decision, dated 20  June  2016,  which  was  sent  to  the
    parties, Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Hutchinson, sitting in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, found that Judge  Dineen's  decision,  allowing  the  appeal,
    contained "an error of law capable of  affecting  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal and that part of the decision is set aside" (paragraph 21).  She
    stated that the "decision on risk on return  will  be  re-made  by  the
    Upper Tribunal" (paragraph 22).

23. The Deputy Judge's reasons for finding an error of law are set  out  in
    the preceding paragraphs of her decision.   On  the  basis  that  Judge
    Dineen's findings, regarding the lack of any KDPI  involvement  on  the
    part of the claimant's father, were to stand, the Deputy Judge accepted
    the submission of the Secretary of  State's  representative  that  "the
    most that the [claimant] could say was that he  unsuccessfully  applied
    for asylum on the basis that he claimed that his father was involved in
    political activity but this claim had  not  been  accepted"  (paragraph
    13).

24. The Deputy Judge's reasoning was as follows:-

         "14. Mr Ti relied on RT (Zimbabwe v Secretary of State for the Home
             Department [2012] UKSC 38.   It  was  his  argument  that  the
             finding that merely being a failed asylum seeker  in  Iran  is
             not a risk factor appeared to be an extension of  the  finding
             that those who exited illegally are not automatically at risk,
             which in turn is based on  the  absence  of  reports  of  ill-
             treatment.  It was Mr Ti's  submission  that  the  absence  of
             reports of ill-treatment can be  explained  by  human  nature,
             that  failed  asylum  seekers  would  not  admit  reasons  for
             claiming asylum that would lead to ill-treatment.

         15.  As I  indicated  at  the  hearing,  this  was  unsubstantiated
             speculation on the part of Mr Ti and I do not find this to  be
             properly arguable.  The case of BA (Demonstrators in Britain -
             risk on return) [2011] UKUT 36 considered  the  RT  (Zimbabwe)
             point that an appellant cannot be expected to  lie  about  any
             activity, it  was  not  considered  that  this  would  make  a
             difference; the guidance in SB was confirmed.

         16.  Given his findings of fact and his findings at [48] I  am  not
             satisfied  that  Judge  Dineen  has  provided   any   adequate
             reasoning for departing from what remains the leading  country
             guidance in relation  to  Iran  that  Iranians  facing  forced
             return do not in general face  a  real  risk  of  persecution.
             Although I accept that Judge Dineen referred  to  the  Amnesty
             International Report at [50] of his decision and  went  on  to
             refer to further reports from the Danish  Refugee  Council  at
             [53] of his decision I am not satisfied  that  cogent  reasons
             have been given for departing from country guidance."

25. At paragraphs 17 and 18, the Deputy Judge explained why  the  delay  in
    Judge Dineen issuing his decision did not amount to an  error  of  law,
    with the result that Judge Dineen's findings at paragraphs 41 to 47  of
    his decision should stand:-

    "17. Although Mr Ti relied on the comments of the permission  of  judge
    and argued that all of Judge Dineen's findings  were  unsafe  given  an
    almost eight month interval between the hearing of  the  decision  (and
    relied on the case of Sambasivam [1999] IAT RF 1999/0419/4), I referred
    the parties to the more recent Tribunal authority of Arusha and Demushi
    (deprivation of citizenship - delay) [2012] UKUT 80 (IAC), which relied
    on the earlier Court of Appeal case of RK  (Algeria)  [2007]  EWCA  Civ
    868.  This establishes that there has to be a nexus between  the  delay
    and the safety of the decision.  Judge Dineen indicates that the  delay
    was in relation to pressure of work.  Although the delay is lamentable,
    the judge clearly set out the evidence that  was  considered  and  made
    clear findings on that evidence.  There were no  substantive  arguments
    before me that might establish that  the  delay  led  to  any  material
    challenge to those findings of fact.

         18. I am therefore satisfied that the findings of fact in  relation
      to credibility and the appellant's circumstances in Iran can stand."

26. As previously stated, Deputy Judge Hutchinson's error of  law  decision
    was sent to the parties, prior to the "re-making" hearing,  which  took
    place on 21 September 2016.

27. In a decision issued on 4 October 2016, the Deputy Judge dismissed  the
    claimant's appeal on asylum and human rights grounds.  At  paragraph  4
    of the Deputy Judge's decision, we find the following:-

         "4.   Although  the  skeleton  argument   from   the   [claimant's]
             representatives sought to re-open the issues of credibility Mr
             Abdar [of Kesar &  Co,  the  claimant's  solicitors]  properly
             conceded that these issues were not before me and the skeleton
             argument was only relied on in respect of risk on  return  and
             Article 8 ..."

28. The Deputy Judge heard oral evidence from the claimant  in  respect  of
    risk on return.  She also had regard to the written  evidence  on  this
    issue, including an expert report by  Professor  Joff�.   That  report,
    however, was "predicated on the basis that the [claimant's] account was
    true, which it is not"  (paragraph  18).   The  Deputy  Judge  accepted
    Professor Joff�'s conclusion that the claimant's return  "as  a  failed
    asylum seeker in itself did not expose  him  to  a  particular  danger"
    (ibid).

29. After further findings in relation to  Professor  Joff�'s  report,  the
    Deputy Judge examined in detail the claimant's case under Article 8  of
    the ECHR.  She concluded that the claimant's removal  from  the  United
    Kingdom would not  disproportionately  interfere  with  his  Article  8
    rights.

30. Mr Abdar, the representative of Kesar &  Co  who  appeared  before  the
    Deputy Judge at the re-making hearing, said the following, in a witness
    statement dated 20 October 2016:-

         "I  duly  attended  the  hearing  on  19  July  2016  before   DUTJ
         Hutchinson.  At the hearing, I raised the issue of the [claimant's]
         credibility, in particular the erroneous findings and preserving of
         the [claimant's] adverse credibility  findings  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal.

         However, DUTJ Hutchinson made it very clear  to  me  that  she  had
         already ruled on the errors of law and was not willing to  consider
         any arguments/submissions on the matter.  The  Upper  Tribunal  was
         now only interested in re-making the decision on the basis  of  SSH
         (Iran)."




    E. The claimant's appeal to the Court of Appeal

31. According to the grounds of  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  seeking
    permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal, Mr Ti, a representative of
    Kesar & Co who appeared on behalf of the claimant at the error  of  law
    hearing, had "failed to argue at the  earlier  hearing"  the  issue  of
    delay, identified by Judge Holmes in his  grant  of  permission.   This
    assertion is reiterated in the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  Court  of
    Appeal, submitted following the refusal of permission to appeal by  the
    Upper Tribunal.  Those grounds contend that the Deputy Judge's error of
    law decision "was made without the benefit  of  full  or  any  argument
    (from AZ's previous representative)".

32. In summary, the grounds of appeal to the Court of Appeal contended that
    the Deputy Tribunal Judge had committed  a  "jurisdictional  error"  in
    refusing, at the re-making  hearing,  to  re-visit  her  error  of  law
    decision, insofar as that decision  preserved  the  findings  of  Judge
    Dineen at paragraphs 41 to 47 of his decision.  The  grounds  contended
    that the Deputy Judge had wrongly assumed that she had no discretion to
    re-visit her error of law decision, even though the proceedings in  the
    Upper Tribunal were not at an end.

33. Ground 2 attacked the reasoning of Judge Dineen in paragraphs 41 to 47.
     The attack included the submission that Judge  Dineen  had  failed  to
    consider or assess the claimant's evidence in the context of his age at
    the relevant times.

34. In a written decision of 1 December 2017, Beatson LJ granted permission
    on the "jurisdiction ground" and the related ground 3, which  was  that
    the Upper Tribunal's decision could not stand "because it  is  infected
    by the UT's jurisdictional  error  and  in  consequence  its  error  in
    failing  to  consider  and  determine  where  the   FtT's   credibility
    assessment was sound in law".

35. Beatson LJ, however, refused permission on ground 2.  He said:-

         "The FtT judge gave reasons for finding the [claimant's] account to
         be incredible at [42] (not credible that the authorities would give
         the subject of a warrant a copy of the warrant before arresting him
         thus giving him time to abscond), [43] (flight from Iraq to  Europe
         was not necessary to avoid consequences  of  an  Iranian  warrant),
         [45] (no link of visits by others to the family home to evidence of
         political activity), and [46] (not satisfied that,  if  father  was
         involved in KDPI activity, he would have returned  to  Iran).   The
         FtT judge found these features of the  applicant's  (sic)  evidence
         not to  be  credible  for  the  reasons  he  gave.   There  was  no
         obligation on him  to  give  the  further  explanations  listed  at
         paragraph 29 of the skeleton argument."

36. On 12 February 2018, by  consent,  the  Court  of  Appeal  allowed  the
    claimant's appeal and remitted the matter to the  Upper  Tribunal  "for
    reconsideration of the grounds of appeal in respect of which permission
    to appeal to the Court of Appeal was granted by Lord Justice  Beatson".
    In the accompanying statement  of  reasons,  settled  by  the  Treasury
    Solicitor, the parties were said to  be  "agreed  that  the  matter  be
    remitted back to the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal for re-hearing of the [claimant's] appeal by the  Tribunal  in
    respect of grounds 1 and 3 only".



    F. Discussion

    (a) The Upper Tribunal's task

37. Section 14(1) and (2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007
    makes it clear that the "relevant appellate court" (here, the Court  of
    Appeal in England and Wales) can set aside  a  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal (which must include part of a  decision)  only  if  the  court
    "finds that the making of the decision concerned involved the making of
    an error on a point of law" (subsection (1)).  It is only if the  Upper
    Tribunal's decision, or part thereof, is set aside that  the  court  is
    able to remit the case to the Upper Tribunal.

38. With this in mind, we have approached the present  proceedings  on  the
    basis that the Court  of  Appeal  has  set  aside  the  Deputy  Judge's
    decision, to the extent that she is to be taken as having held, at  the
    re-making hearing, that she did not have jurisdiction to  re-visit  the
    "delay" ground, upon which  Judge  Holmes  had  granted  permission  to
    appeal to the Secretary of State. The Deputy Judge's re-making decision
    therefore also had to be treated as set aside. It did not appear to  us
    that any issue was taken by the Court of Appeal regarding  the  setting
    aside of Judge Dineen's decision as to risk on return. If  his  factual
    findings at paragraphs 41 to 47 were sound, then his assessment of risk
    was plainly flawed. No submission to the contrary was made to us at our
    hearing on 12 June 2018.

39. Accordingly, at that hearing, we heard submissions from the parties  as
    to whether Judge Dineen's findings  at  paragraphs  41  to  47  of  his
    decision could be allowed to stand,  in  the  light  of  the  delay  in
    promulgating that decision.

40. At the hearing, we went through the paragraphs in  question.   In  each
    case, Mr Smyth was unable  to  advance  any  coherent  reason  why  the
    findings were, in any way, rendered questionable by the  delay  between
    Judge Dineen's hearing the appeal and promulgating his decision.  It is
    quite evident that there is no such connection.  We  therefore  had  no
    hesitation in coming to the  same  conclusion  that  the  Deputy  Judge
    reached in her error of law decision.







    (b) Application under rule 15(2A)

41. We then considered an application under rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 to adduce evidence that  was  not
    before the First-tier Tribunal.   This  evidence  comprises  a  witness
    statement of the claimant, in which he gives an explanation as  to  how
    it came to be that he was recorded by the Home  Office,  in  connection
    with his asylum claim, as having described the document shown to him by
    his father as an arrest warrant.

42. As we have seen, the issue of whether this was an  arrest  warrant  or,
    perhaps, some form of summons, was a material reason why the  Secretary
    of State and, later, Judge Dineen  rejected  the  claimant's  assertion
    that his father had been involved in KDPI activities in Iran.

43. In connection with the rule 15(2A) application, we heard oral  evidence
    from Mr Turner,  who  is  the  claimant's  foster  father.   Mr  Turner
    explained how the significance of the description of the document (both
    in English and Kurdish Sorani) had not been appreciated by the claimant
    or Mr Turner until after the first set of Upper  Tribunal  proceedings.
    Around this time, there had been a family barbeque, at which  a  friend
    (who, it appears, is Kurdish) had explained  the  distinction  and  its
    significance.  Mr  Turner  then  did  some  internet  research  on  the
    subject.

44. The upshot is that, according to Mr Turner and  the  claimant,  at  the
    time the claimant was recorded by the Home Office as  referring  to  an
    arrest warrant, the claimant assumed that this was the correct term for
    the document that he had seen and he did not, at that  time,  have  any
    reason to doubt it.

45. We were impressed by Mr Turner, as a witness.  What  he  described;  in
    particular, the events surrounding the family barbeque,  struck  us  as
    having a ring of truth. We  were  satisfied  that,  in  the  particular
    circumstances of this case, there had not been  unreasonable  delay  in
    producing the evidence in question.

46. In all the circumstances, therefore,  we  decided  to  grant  the  rule
    15(2A) application, with the result that the decision in the appeal now
    requires to be re-heard in the Upper Tribunal by reference to both oral
    and written evidence.  We gave directions for the filing and service of
    the claimant's materials and the Secretary of State's submissions.   It
    will be for the Upper Tribunal to determine the factual matrix, in  the
    light of the rule 15(2A) and other evidence, along with evidence as  to
    the general position (as regards both risk return to Iran  and  Article
    8), as existing at the present time.




    (c) Revisiting error of law decisions

47. We return to the issue of the Upper Tribunal's jurisdiction to  revisit
    an error of law decision, that results  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision being set aside, where the Upper Tribunal is proceeding to re-
    make the decision in the appeal.

48. In VOM (Error of law - when appealable) Nigeria [2016] UKUT 00410,  the
    Upper Tribunal held that an appeal from that  Tribunal  lies  with  the
    Court of Appeal "only against a decision of the  UT  which  is  finally
    dispositive of an appeal from the FtT".

49. Section 12 is very similar, in structure, to section 14,  to  which  we
    have referred at paragraph 37 above.  Section 12(1) and (2) provide  as
    follows:-

         "(1) Subsection (2) applies if the Upper Tribunal, in  deciding  an
             appeal under section 11, finds that the making of the decision
             concerned involved the making of an error on a point of law.

         (2)  The Upper Tribunal -

             (a)  may (but need not) set aside the decision of  the  First-
                  tier Tribunal; and

             (b)  if it does, must either -

                  (i)  remit  the  case  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  with
                      directions for its reconsideration, or

                  (ii) re-make the decision."

50. If, as VOM holds, the decision-making process of the Upper Tribunal  is
    not materially complete, for the purposes of onward appeal,  until  the
    Upper  Tribunal  has  re-made  the  decision  pursuant   to   paragraph
    12(2)(b)(ii), the  corollary  must  be  that,  until  this  process  is
    complete, the Upper Tribunal has jurisdiction to re-visit its error  of
    law findings, notwithstanding that those  findings  have  been  set  in
    writing and sent to the parties.

51. The fact that the Upper Tribunal possesses such jurisdiction  has  been
    recognised in this Chamber, ever since its creation in  February  2010.
    Practice Direction 3 (Procedure on appeal) of the  Practice  Directions
    for the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal  and
    the Upper Tribunal, made on  10  February  2010,  provide  (so  far  as
    relevant) as follows:-

         3.1  Where permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  been
             granted, then, unless and to the extent that they are directed
             otherwise, for the purposes of preparing for a hearing in  the
             Upper Tribunal the parties should assume that:

             (a)  the Upper Tribunal will decide whether the making of  the
                  decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of
                  an error on a point of law, such that the decision  should
                  be set aside under section 12(2)(a) of the 2007 Act;

             (b)  except as specified in Practice Statement  7.2  (disposal
                  of appeals by Upper Tribunal),  the  Upper  Tribunal  will
                  proceed   to   re-make   the   decision   under    section
                  12(2)(b)(ii), if  satisfied  that  the  original  decision
                  should be set aside; and

             (c)  in that event, the Upper Tribunal will  consider  whether
                  to re-make the decision by  reference  to  the  First-tier
                  Tribunal's  findings  of  fact  and  any  new  documentary
                  evidence submitted  under  UT  rule  15(2A)  which  it  is
                  reasonably practicable to adduce for consideration at that
                  hearing.


         3.2  The  parties  should  be  aware  that,  in  the  circumstances
             described  in  paragraph  3.1(c),  the  Upper  Tribunal   will
             generally expect to proceed, without any further  hearing,  to
             re-make the decision, where this  can  be  undertaken  without
             having to hear oral evidence.  In certain  circumstances,  the
             Upper Tribunal may give directions  for  the  giving  of  oral
             evidence at the relevant hearing, where it appears appropriate
             to do so.  Such directions may be  given  before  or  at  that
             hearing.


         3.3  In a case where no oral evidence is likely to be  required  in
             order for the Upper Tribunal  to  re-make  the  decision,  the
             Upper Tribunal will therefore expect any documentary  evidence
             relevant to the re-making of the decision  to  be  adduced  in
             accordance with  Practice  Direction  4  so  that  it  may  be
             considered at the  relevant  hearing;  and,  accordingly,  the
             party seeking to rely on such  documentary  evidence  will  be
             expected  to  show  good  reason  why  it  is  not  reasonably
             practicable  to  adduce  the  same  in  order  for  it  to  be
             considered at that hearing.

         3.4  If the Upper Tribunal  nevertheless  decides  that  it  cannot
             proceed as described in paragraph 3.1(c) because  findings  of
             fact are needed which it is not in a  position  to  make,  the
             Upper Tribunal will make arrangements for the  adjournment  of
             the hearing, so that the proceedings may be  completed  before
             the same constitution of the Tribunal;  or,  if  that  is  not
             reasonably practicable, for  their  transfer  to  a  different
             constitution, in either case so as to enable  evidence  to  be
             adduced for that purpose.


         3.5   Where  proceedings  are  transferred  in  the   circumstances
             described in paragraph 3.4, any documents sent to or given  by
             the Tribunal from which the proceedings are transferred  shall
             be deemed to have been sent to or given  by  the  Tribunal  to
             which those proceedings are transferred.

         3.6  Where such proceedings are  transferred,  the  Upper  Tribunal
             shall prepare written reasons for finding that the  First-tier
             Tribunal made an error of law, such that its decision fell  to
             be set aside, and those written reasons shall be sent  to  the
             parties before the next hearing.

         3.7  The written reasons shall be incorporated in full in, and form
             part of, the determination of the Upper Tribunal that re-makes
             the decision.  Only in very exceptional cases can the decision
             contained in those written reasons be departed from or  varied
             by the  Upper  Tribunal  which  re-makes  the  decision  under
             section 12(2)(b)(ii) of the 2007 Act.

         ..."  (bold italics are our emphasis)

52. The real issue, therefore, is not whether the Upper Tribunal  possesses
    jurisdiction in these circumstances; it does.  The issue is, rather, in
    what circumstances will a party be permitted by the Tribunal to raise a
    matter, at the re-making stage, which, if accepted,  would  lead  to  a
    change in the written "error of law" reasons?

53. The answer is precisely that given in Practice Direction 3.7.  It  will
    only be in a "very exceptional" case that this should occur.

54. The Upper Tribunal would be hobbled if its error of law decisions could
    be routinely re-visited in cases where, pursuant to Practice  Direction
    3, the Tribunal proceeds to re-make the decision in the appeal,  rather
    than remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Neither  the
    Secretary of State nor those who were appellants before the  First-tier
    Tribunal would gain anything of legitimate value from such a  state  of
    affairs.  The overriding objective of dealing  with  cases  fairly  and
    justly would be imperilled.

55. Although Practice  Direction  3.5  to  3.7  deals  expressly  with  the
    situation where proceedings are transferred, following the error of law
    decision, the same restraint must be observed where the judge  who  has
    decided to set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision proceeds to re-
    make the case.  As we have seen, that was the situation in the  present
    appeal, where Deputy Judge Hutchinson produced a written "error of  law
    decision".  What she did represents best practice.

56. As we have indicated, the fact that the Court  of  Appeal  allowed  the
    claimant's appeal means that the Deputy Judge must  be  taken  to  have
    concluded that she had no jurisdiction to re-visit  her  error  of  law
    decision, at the hearing on 21 September 2016.

57.  It will, however, be plain from what we  have  said  already  that  Mr
    Abdar, who appeared for the claimant at that hearing,  could  not  have
    advanced any argument that might, even conceivably, have put  the  case
    into the "exceptional" category, which would have required  the  Deputy
    Judge to depart from or vary her error of law decision.

58. On the contrary, the argument that  Mr  Abdar  wanted  to  advance  was
    hopeless (see paragraph 31 above).  The  mere  fact  that  a  different
    representative of the  claimant,  compared  with  the  person  who  had
    attended at the error of law hearing, might have thought that he  could
    do a better job than that person  in  advancing  the  ground  based  on
    delay, does not come near making the case an exceptional one.   In  any
    event, so far as the substance is concerned, as we have seen the Deputy
    Judge was right to conclude that the delay on the part of Judge  Dineen
    in issuing his decision had no connection with his credibility findings
    regarding the claimant's father.  The Deputy Judge was entirely correct
    to cite and rely on Arusha and Demushi.




    (d) The effect of delay in producing a Tribunal decision

59. The issue of delay  in  the  production  of  a  Tribunal  decision  has
    recently been examined in detail by the Court  of  Appeal  in  SS  (Sri
    Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
    1391.  After a comprehensive analysis of the relevant case law, both in
    the immigration  jurisdiction  and  outside  it,  Leggatt  LJ  held  as
    follows:-

         "28. There is no justification for applying a different or  special
             approach on appeals to the  Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and
             Asylum  Chamber)  from  the  approach   which   is   generally
             applicable in cases of delay in giving a decision.   Nor  does
             the fact that the appellant's credibility was in issue justify
             applying a different test - though it may of course, depending
             on the circumstances, be an important factor in  applying  the
             test.  There is no good reason to remit a case  for  rehearing
             just because  it  turned  on  assessment  of  the  appellant's
             credibility  if  the  appellate  court  or  tribunal  can   be
             confident that the assessment has not  been  affected  by  the
             delay.  In each case, the question that needs to be  asked  is
             whether the delay in preparation of the  decision  has  caused
             the decision to be unsafe.

         29.  It can therefore be confirmed that the approach to  the  issue
             of delay adopted by the Upper Tribunal in the case  of  Arusha
             and Demushi,  applying  the  decision  of  this  court  in  RK
             (Algeria), which requires a nexus  to  be  shown  between  the
             delay and the safety of the decision, is the correct approach.
              The only significance of the fact that delay between  hearing
             and decision has exceeded three months is that on an appeal to
             the Upper Tribunal this period remains an  appropriate  marker
             of when delay is of such  length  that  it  requires  the  FTT
             judge's findings of fact to  be  scrutinised  with  particular
             care  to  ensure  that  the  delay  has   not   infected   the
             determination."

60. In  the  claimant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  for
    permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the Deputy  Judge's
    decision, there is an assertion that the delay in issuing the  decision
    of Judge Dineen in some way constituted a "substantive issue in and  of
    itself", going to the fairness of the judge's findings.   It  is  clear
    from the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v  RK  (Algeria)
    [2007] EWCA Civ 868 that such an assertion is false.  As Wilson LJ said
    of the Secretary of State in that case:-

         "She is not appealing against the delay.  She is appealing  against
         the decision; and, if she can, she  must,  in  some  rational  way,
         present the delay as  a  source  of  infection  of  the  decision."
         (paragraph 22)



    (e) Granting permission to appeal on  a  ground  not  advanced  by  the
    applicant

61. The reason why the proceedings in the present appeal have continued for
    nearly two years after the Deputy Judge issued her  re-making  decision
    in October 2016 is because First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes decided  to
    grant permission partly by reference to a ground that had not  featured
    in the Secretary  of  State's  application  for  permission  to  appeal
    against Judge Dineen's decision.  It is therefore necessary  to  remind
    ourselves of the law on this issue.

62. In R v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  ex  parte  Robinson
    [1998] QB 929, the Court of Appeal was concerned  with  an  application
    for judicial review of a refusal by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal  of
    permission to appeal against a decision of a special adjudicator.   The
    court said:-

         "38. It is .... necessary for us to identify the  circumstances  in
             which it might be appropriate for the Tribunal to grant  leave
             to appeal on the basis of an argument not advanced before  the
             special adjudicator, or for a High Court judge to grant  leave
             to apply for judicial review of a  refusal  of  leave  by  the
             Tribunal in relation to a point not taken  in  the  Notice  of
             Appeal to the Tribunal.

         39.  Because the rules place an onus on the asylum-seeker to  state
             his grounds of appeal, we consider that it would be  wrong  to
             say that merely arguability should  be  the  criterion  to  be
             applied for the grant  of  leave  in  such  circumstances.   A
             higher hurdle is required.  The appellate  authorities  should
             of course focus primarily  on  the  arguments  adduced  before
             them, whether these are to  be  found  in  the  oral  argument
             before the special adjudicator or, so far as the  Tribunal  is
             concerned, in the written grounds of appeal on which leave  to
             appeal is sought.  They are not required to engage in a search
             for new points.  If there is readily  discernible  an  obvious
             point of Convention law which favours the  applicant  although
             he has not taken it, then the special adjudicator should apply
             it in his favour, but he should feel under  no  obligation  to
             prolong the hearing by asking the parties for  submissions  on
             points which they have not taken but which could  be  properly
             categorised as merely  "arguable"  as  opposed  to  "obvious".
             Similarly,  if   when   the   Tribunal   reads   the   Special
             Adjudicator's decision there is an obvious point of Convention
             law favourable to the asylum-seeker which does not  appear  in
             the decision, it should grant leave to appeal.  If it does not
             do so, there will be a danger that this  country  will  be  in
             breach of its obligations under the Convention.  When we refer
             to an obvious point  we  mean  a  point  which  has  a  strong
             prospect of success if it is argued.  Nothing  less  will  do.
             It follows that leave  to  apply  for  judicial  review  of  a
             refusal by the Tribunal to grant leave  to  appeal  should  be
             granted if the judge is of the opinion  that  it  is  properly
             arguable that a point not raised in the Grounds of  Appeal  to
             the Tribunal had a strong prospect  of  success  if  leave  to
             appeal were to be granted."

63. As is pointed out at 4.222 of Jacobs, Tribunal Practice  and  Procedure
    (Fourth Edition), the "Robinson" approach was, in effect,  extended  to
    all Tribunals  by  Scott  Baker  J  in  R  (Begum)  v  Social  Security
    Commissioners [2002] EWHC 401 (Admin).  This was on the ground that  it
    would be confusing and without logic to apply different  tests.   Here,
    also, the court emphasised that mere arguability is not  the  test  and
    that a higher hurdle must be surmounted.  The point had to be  obvious,
    in the sense of being one with  a  strong  prospect  of  success,  were
    permission to be granted (see paragraphs 20 and 31).

64. In its application to asylum law, the "Robinson" approach applies  only
    in favour of the individual, who is seeking asylum; not  in  favour  of
    the Secretary of State.  An exception, however, arises where the  point
    identified concerns a possible breach of the Refugee Convention,  which
    would result from recognising a person as a refugee who  is,  in  fact,
    covered by one of the exclusion clauses in the Refugee Convention (see,
    in this regard, paragraph 21.38  of  MacDonald's  Immigration  Law  and
    Practice (Ninth Edition) and A (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2005] EWCA Civ 1438.

65. In Bulale v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA  Civ
    806, the Court of Appeal considered an  appeal  by  a  citizen  of  the
    Netherlands against a decision of the Secretary of State to deport  him
    under the  provisions  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.  His appeal failed before a panel of the  Asylum  and
    Immigration Tribunal and also  on  reconsideration  by  that  Tribunal,
    pursuant to section 103A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002.

66. During the  proceedings  in  the  Court  of  Appeal,  Counsel  for  the
    appellant sought to raise an issue that had not featured in the  Asylum
    and Immigration Tribunal; namely, whether the appellant's propensity to
    commit robberies constituted a sufficiently serious threat  to  society
    to justify his expulsion.

67. Buxton LJ dealt with the matter in this way:-

         "Is this argument open to Mr Bulale?

         23.  Miss Broadfoot pointed out, correctly, that this issue had not
             been raised before the AIT, nor in the skeleton settled by  Mr
             Bulale's previous advisers in this court.  The AIT could  not,
             therefore, have erred in law in not addressing the point, on a
             reconsideration,  which  this  case  was,  the  AIT  only  had
             jurisdiction to consider points addressed  in  the  order  for
             reconsideration or  those  which  were  Robinson-obvious;  and
             accordingly this court in turn had no jurisdiction to consider
             the point on appeal.

         24.  I have concluded that this court  does  have  jurisdiction  to
             consider this issue, but I would emphasise the  importance  of
             the principles referred to in the previous paragraph, and  the
             importance of only departing  from  them  in  very  particular
             circumstances.  I would agree with  Miss  Broadfoot  that  the
             point now under consideration is not "Robinson-obvious" in the
             sense that a court could be criticised for not  taking  it  of
             its own motion.  However, the issue appeared to this court, on
             seeing the papers, to be engaged and to  be  of  some  general
             importance.  That was the principal reason why the court  went
             to the considerable length described earlier in this  judgment
             to ensure that Mr Bulale was represented before it,  and  that
             this point was taken on his behalf.  The basis of the Robinson
             doctrine is, as Lord Woolf MR said, [1998]  QB  at  p  945B-G,
             that as organs of the  state  the  appellate  authorities  are
             bound  to  exercise  their  powers  to  ensure   the   state's
             compliance   with   its   international   obligations.    That
             observation was in Robinson itself directed at the High  Court
             in its appellate role, but they  must  apply  equally  to  the
             Court of Appeal.  Accordingly, and whether or not the point is
             "obvious", once it has in fact occurred to the court  it  must
             be open to the court to pursue it.  I stress that  that  gives
             no general licence to the parties to  reformulate  their  case
             once it arrives in this court."

68. There are two points to observe about  Bulale.   First,  the  Court  of
    Appeal  was  speaking  about  itself,  rather  than  laying  down   any
    qualification of the "Robinson" doctrine, as it applies  to  tribunals.
    Secondly,  Buxton  LJ  was  concerned  with  whether  the   Court   had
    jurisdiction to consider the matter.  As the last sentence in paragraph
    24 of his judgment makes plain, the fact  that  the  Court  might  have
    jurisdiction does  not  mean  that  a  new  issue  will,  in  fact,  be
    entertained.  In the light of these  points,  it  is  unclear  to  what
    extent Bulale represents a relaxation of the threshold contained in the
    "Robinson" approach, as it applies at Tribunal level.

69. In conclusion, we consider that any judge who is considering whether to
    grant permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  must  not  grant
    permission  on  a  ground  which  does  not  feature  in  the   grounds
    accompanying the application, unless the judge is  satisfied  that  the
    ground he or she has identified is one which has a strong  prospect  of
    success for the original appellant; or  for  the  Secretary  of  State,
    where the ground relates to a decision  which,  if  undisturbed,  would
    breach  the  United  Kingdom's  international  treaty  obligations;  or
    (possibly) if the ground relates to an  issue  of  general  importance,
    which the Upper Tribunal needs to address.

70. The basic point to be borne in mind is that there must be an  extremely
    sound reason for, in effect, compelling the parties  to  an  appeal  to
    engage with a matter that neither of them has identified.

71. The present case is an object lesson  in  what  can  happen  when  this
    principle of restraint is not respected.  In paragraph 2 of  his  grant
    of permission, Judge Holmes referred  to  two  cases  on  delay:  Mario
    [1998] Imm AR 281 and Sambasivam [1999] OATRF 1999/0419/4.  As we  have
    seen, however, this was not a correct identification  of  the  relevant
    case law.  In particular, Judge Holmes failed to have regard to  Arusha
    and Demushi.  Had he done so, he would have seen - as  did  the  Deputy
    Judge - that there was, in fact, no nexus between the delay in  issuing
    the decision and the findings regarding credibility.

72. In other words, far from being a case where the ground raised of  Judge
    Holmes's own volition was strongly arguable, it was  not  a  ground  at
    all.

73. Furthermore, the party applying for permission to appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was the Secretary of State.  As we have seen, this raises  its
    own  issues.   The  subsequent  proceedings  have  clearly  shown  that
    granting permission on the "delay" issue was not something that was  of
    assistance to the Secretary of State.  It may be that, in  granting  on
    this ground, Judge Holmes was intending to present the claimant with  a
    potential counter-argument to the effect that, even if Judge Dineen had
    erred in law regarding his findings on risk on  return,  based  on  his
    findings of fact, the claimant could advance the "delay"  issue  before
    the Upper Tribunal in order to secure a re-hearing of the entire  case.



74. If that was so, Judge Holmes should, in our view, have made it plain in
    his grant of  permission.  In  any  event,  the  basic  point  is  that
    permission on the "delay" issue should never have  been  granted.   The
    fact that there has  been  a  successful  rule  15(2A)  application  is
    nothing to the point.




    (f) Summary of the position

75. The position we  have  reached  is,  accordingly,  as  follows.   Judge
    Dineen's decision remains set aside because  it  contained  a  material
    error of law regarding the assessment of risk on return, based  on  his
    findings of fact.  Following the allowing of the appeal in the Court of
    Appeal and its remission to the Upper Tribunal, we  have  re-heard  the
    claimant's submissions on the "delay" issue.   Those  submissions  have
    failed to persuade us that Judge Dineen's findings of fact fall  to  be
    disregarded because of the issue of delay.

76. We have, however, granted permission under rule 15(2A) for the claimant
    to adduce evidence at the forthcoming re-making hearing, concerning the
    issue of the document which he says his father showed  him.   For  this
    reason, Judge Dineen's findings regarding the  claimant's  father  will
    not necessarily be material to the outcome of the appeal.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
