                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellants

   1. The Appellants are both citizens of Bulgaria. The first Appellant  who
      was born on 1st of July 1972 is the mother of the  2nd  Appellant  who
      was born on 31st of October 1992. They appealed against a decision  of
      the Respondent dated 30th of December 2016 to refuse to grant  them  a
      document certifying permanent residence pursuant to Regulation 15  (1)
      (a) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the
      2006 Regulations"). They asked for their appeals to be  determined  on
      the papers. Unfortunately,  their  appeals  became  separated  in  the
      Tribunal system which resulted in their appeals  being  determined  on
      the papers by two separately constituted Tribunals.


   2. The 2nd Appellant's appeal was allowed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Beg on 20th of April 2017. The  1st  Appellant's  appeal  was
      dismissed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Cox  on  2nd  of  March
      2017. She has appealed that decision and the Respondent  has  appealed
      the decision to allow the 2nd  Appellant's  appeal.  For  the  reasons
      which I set out below, I have set aside the decision  to  dismiss  the
      1st Appellant's appeal and  upheld  the  decision  to  allow  the  2nd
      Appellant's appeal. I will therefore refer to the parties as they were
      known at first instance for the sake of convenience.

The Appellants' Case

   3. On 19th of October 2007 the first Appellant was  issued  with  an  "A2
      exempt from accession worker scheme card". On 7th of October 2016  she
      applied for a document certifying permanent residence under  the  2006
      Regulations. She had been working in this country  for  more  than  10
      years and 6 months at the  date  of  her  application  and  wished  to
      continue to work in this country.


   4. The 2nd  Appellant  graduated  from  Ellington  School  for  girls  in
      Ramsgate in 2009. She graduated from the University of  Creative  Arts
      in Canterbury in 2011 and from the University of Brighton in 2016. She
      is currently in full-time work. She had been in the United Kingdom for
      over 10 years and considered this country her home. She wished to make
      a career here.

The Explanations for Refusal

   5.  The  Respondent  refused  the  1st  Appellant's  application  because
      insufficient information had been given to her by the 1st Appellant in
      the application form. The 1st Appellant had not declared how  she  had
      exercised her treaty rights for a continuous  period  of  5  years  as
      required by the Regulations. It  was  unknown  whether  she  had  been
      employed,  self-employed  or  otherwise.  There  was  no  evidence  of
      dependency on her by the 2nd Appellant during  the  5  years  the  1st
      Appellant could have been exercising  treaty  rights.  The  Respondent
      refused the 2nd Appellant's application on a  similar  basis  that  is
      that insufficient evidence had  been  provided  with  the  application
      form. In their respective appeals both Appellants  gave  substantially
      more documentation to support their claims  than  they  had  in  their
      applications to the Respondent.

The Decisions at First Instance

   6. Judge Cox refused the 1st Appellant's appeal because although  he  was
      satisfied that she had now shown that she  had  been  working  for  at
      least five years in the United Kingdom she could not demonstrate  that
      she had been working continuously. She needed to show that she had not
      been absent from the United Kingdom in any year for more than 6 months
      in total. The Appellant had produced her P  60s  with  her  notice  of
      appeal and the Judge at  [11]  had  summarised  the  amounts  the  1st
      Appellant had earned in the respective years. The difficulty was  that
      the P60 for the tax year ending 6th of April 2014 showed that she  had
      only earned ï¿½7,236.66p which the Judge stated was less  than  half  of
      the income for the previous two tax years and the following tax year.


   7. The 1st Appellant had not provided any information explaining why  her
      income was significantly less for that year. The Judge  accepted  that
      it could be for an entirely neutral reason for example  that  the  1st
      Appellant had reduced her weekly working hours for a  period.  On  the
      other hand, it could also be because the 1st Appellant  had  left  the
      United Kingdom and did not return for more than 6 months. As the  case
      was being determined on the papers he was not in a position  to  know.
      He therefore found that the Appellant  had  failed  to  discharge  the
      burden upon her that she had been continuously working in this country
      for five years. He dismissed the appeal.


   8. In her determination Judge Beg noted that she had been supplied with a
      letter from the Ellington School for girls which referred to  the  2nd
      Appellant's GCSE results. There was also  a  GCSE  certificate  and  a
      national diploma from the  University  for  Creative  Arts  which  was
      awarded in June 2011. There was a certificate from the  University  of
      Brighton to show that the 2nd Appellant had been awarded a  BA  degree
      in textiles and business studies on 22nd of June 2015. There was  also
      a P60 for the year ending 5th of  April  2016  showing  that  the  2nd
      Appellant had had employment  in  this  country  in  the  previous  12
      months. Judge Beg concluded  at  [5]  that  the  2nd  Appellant  could
      demonstrate she was in full-time education  in  this  country  through
      secondary school and further education. She met the  requirements  for
      permanent residence. She had lived continuously in this country for at
      least 5 years and exercised treaty rights as a student. The appeal was
      allowed.

The Onward Appeals

   9. The Respondent appealed Judge Beg's decision on the grounds  that  the
      1st Appellant's appeal had been dismissed in March 2017 a month before
      Judge Beg had dealt with the 2nd Appellant's case.  The  dismissal  of
      the 1st Appellant's appeal  meant  that  the  1st  Appellant  was  not
      qualified under the  2006  Regulations  and  by  association  the  2nd
      Appellant as her dependent could not satisfy the  Regulations  either.
      The  Respondent  pointed  to  the  fact  that  this  was  a   combined
      application and jointly refused.
  10. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Grant-Hutchison on 8th of November 2017  on  the  basis  that  it  was
      arguable that Judge  Beg  was  aware  that  the  appeals  of  the  two
      Appellants were inextricably linked but had  failed  to  consider  the
      evidence as a whole specifically that the 1st Appellant's  appeal  had
      been dismissed.


  11. The 1st Appellant appealed the dismissal of her appeal arguing she had
      not been absent from the United Kingdom for six months. She  submitted
      two more P60 forms for the relevant periods which showed that she  had
      worked in two care homes but only one of them had been referred to  by
      the Tribunal in dismissing her appeal.


  12. Her application for permission to appeal came  on  the  papers  before
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Gillespie on 29  September  2017.  He
      found that it was  arguably  an  error  of  law,  on  the  grounds  of
      procedural unfairness, to raise against the 1st Appellant that she had
      been absent from the United Kingdom for more than 6  months  when  she
      had had no notice of any such issue and no opportunity to address  it.
      The Judge's conclusion had been a speculative allegation or  inference
      not raised by the  Respondent  of  a  potential  absence  such  as  to
      interrupt continuity of residence. He granted permission to appeal.


  13. The Respondent replied to the grant of permission by letter dated  8th
      of November 2017 arguing that because it  was  a  requirement  of  the
      Regulations that there should not be any periods of absence  exceeding
      6 months  the  Judge  was  entitled  to  consider  whether  the  first
      Appellant had been continuously resident and  working  in  the  United
      Kingdom.

The Hearing Before Me

  14. Both Appellants attended the  hearing.  I  heard  brief  evidence  and
      submissions. The 1st Appellant stated that she had had 2 jobs  at  the
      same time in the tax year ending April 2014 but one of  the  P60s  was
      missing. She had not travelled to Bulgaria  or  anywhere  else  for  6
      months or more during that time. She  was  a  bank  nurse  working  in
      various care homes. She had a P 45  from  one  of  the  companies  she
      worked for in the tax year ending April 2014. She had  lost  that  P60
      but the P45 was evidence that she had been  working  at  the  relevant
      time.


  15. At the conclusion of the hearing I announced that I  would  allow  the
      1st Appellant's appeal and dismiss the Respondent's appeal against the
      2nd Appellant's decision. I indicated that I would give my reasons  in
      writing which I now do.

Findings

  16. The principal issue  in  the  case  before  me  was  whether  the  1st
      Appellant could demonstrate that she had been continuously working  in
      the United Kingdom for at least 5 years. Regulation 15 (1) (a) of  the
      2006 Regulations provides that a person who can demonstrate that  they
      have resided in the United Kingdom in accordance with the  Regulations
      for a continuous period of five  years  shall  acquire  the  right  to
      reside permanently here. Regulation 4 defines a student as someone who
      has been enrolled for the principal purpose of pursuing  a  course  of
      study at a public or private establishment.


  17.  The difficulty in the case was that the initial applications made  by
      the Appellants to the Respondent were clearly inadequate. It  was  not
      surprising that the Respondent came to the decision she  did  on  both
      applications given the very sparse information provided on the  forms.
      I can only assume that neither Appellant took advice before submitting
      the application forms and were not fully aware of the requirements  in
      the forms (notwithstanding that the Respondent publishes  guidance  on
      how to complete the forms). As a result,  both  Appellants  were  very
      much the authors of their own misfortune in receiving  decisions  from
      the Respondent refusing their respective applications.


  18. However, I remind myself that these are applications  under  the  2006
      Regulations and that matters have to be decided  by  the  Tribunal  on
      appeal at the date of hearing. Thus, it was open to both Appellants to
      provide further information with their notices of  appeal  which  they
      duly did. This resulted in the 2nd Appellant's appeal being allowed by
      Judge Beg. Given the evidence which was before Judge Beg which clearly
      showed that  the  2nd  Appellant  had  been  studying  at  appropriate
      institutions she was entitled to come to the decision she did that the
      2nd Appellant had been exercising treaty rights as  a  student  for  a
      period exceeding 5 years.


  19. However, the 2nd Appellant could only succeed on that  ground  if  the
      1st Appellant could succeed on the basis that  she  had  been  working
      continuously for 5 years since the 2nd Appellant  was  dependent  upon
      the first Appellant's appeal. The issue before me is whether  the  1st
      Appellant is able to show that she  has  worked  continuously  for  at
      least 5 years. I agree with the  point  made  by  Judge  Gillespie  in
      granting permission to appeal against the decision of Judge  Cox  that
      the 1st Appellant had no notice of  the  issue  that  would  be  taken
      against her.


  20. The Respondent had refused the 1st Appellant's application because the
      first Appellant had provided no information beyond the bare  assertion
      that she had been working in the United Kingdom for at least 10 years.
      By the time of the hearing before Judge Cox there was evidence  before
      him that the 1st Appellant had been working for the  requisite  period
      of 5  years  and  earning  a  substantial  amount.  Although  the  1st
      Appellant's earnings for the tax year ending April 2014 were less than
      the 2 years preceding that period and the 2 years  following  it,  the
      first Appellant was still earning more than a  nominal  amount  having
      earned ï¿½7236.66 p in the year ending April 2014.


  21. Was the difference in earnings sufficient by itself to justify finding
      that the 1st Appellant could not show that she had been in the  United
      Kingdom throughout the period of 12 months ending  in  April  2014?  I
      have considerable sympathy with the position the Judge  found  himself
      in given that the first Appellant had only asked for her appeal to  be
      determined on the papers. I have no doubt that if the matter had  been
      listed for an oral  hearing  (and  the  1st  Appellant  had  paid  the
      appropriate fee), she would have been  able  to  produce  evidence  to
      Judge Cox to show that she had  been  continuously  employed  in  this
      country and the need for an onward appeal would not have arisen.


  22. That said I can only set aside the First-tier's decision if I  find  a
      material error of law in  it.  That  the  1st  Appellant  has  further
      evidence not before the First-tier Tribunal  does  not  demonstrate  a
      material error of law. I have to look at the determination  itself  to
      establish whether there was a material error of law. At [18] the Judge
      took the point against the 1st Appellant that there  was  insufficient
      information explaining why her income was significantly less  for  the
      relevant year. If the Judge wished to hold against the  1st  Appellant
      that a reduction in earnings meant she could  not  have  been  in  the
      United Kingdom for more than 6 months the correct  course  would  have
      been to have made a direction that the 1st Appellant should answer the
      point. It need not have been  by  way  of  an  oral  hearing,  written
      submissions could have sufficed.


  23. As that was not done I am satisfied there was a material error of  law
      for the reasons given by Judge Gillespie and I set the decision of the
      First-tier aside. As I remake the decision in this case I am  able  to
      take into account further evidence that was not before  Judge  Cox  at
      first instance. Specifically, the  1st  Appellant  produced  to  me  a
      further document which had not been for the First-tier Tribunal.  This
      was a P45 indicating that she had left her employment with  a  company
      called Mayday Direct on 23rd of May 2014. This was shortly  after  the
      end of the relevant  financial  year  and  indicated  that  the  first
      Appellant had earned ï¿½2,145 to the date of leaving. It was clear  that
      the 1st Appellant had other employment besides that shown on  the  P60
      for the tax year ending April 2014  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
      That  P60  showed  she  had  been  working  for  a  different  company
      altogether called Guild Care.


  24. The pattern of the 1st Appellant's employment was that she had  worked
      for a number of care companies. This explained the irregularity in the
      amounts that she earned. There were wide discrepancies  from  year  to
      year in her P60s reflecting the fact that she moved from  employer  to
      employer depending on the availability of work. Her own oral testimony
      which I accept is that she did not return  to  Bulgaria  or  otherwise
      travel outside the United Kingdom during the  tax  year  ending  April
      2014 and that the reason why her earnings for the tax year ending 2014
      were lower was because she only submitted one P60 when there had  been
      other employments during that period. This is confirmed  by  the  fact
      that the work she did for Mayday Direct does not appear on the P60 for
      the tax year ending April 2015. That only shows the income she  earned
      working for a company called Guild Care in Worthing.


25. As I have indicated  the  1st  Appellant's  failure  to  submit  proper
    documentation on time has caused her a great deal of inconvenience  but
    I must look at the situation  as  it  is  now.  I  find  that  the  1st
    Appellant can demonstrate that she worked continuously  in  the  United
    Kingdom for at least a 5-year period and that there were no unexplained
    absences of 6 months or more. She is therefore  entitled  to  permanent
    residence under Regulation 15. As I find that she succeeds  so  I  find
    that the 2nd Appellant, her daughter also succeeds. It was an error not
    to refer to the 1st Appellant's situation in the 2nd Appellant's appeal
    but as the 1st Appellant was entitled to succeed it was not a  material
    error. I uphold the decision to allow the 2nd Appellant's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in the case  of  the  1st  Appellant
involved the making of a material error of law and I have set  it  aside.  I
remake the decision by allowing  the  1st  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
Respondent's decision.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law in relation to the 2nd Appellant's  appeal  and  I  uphold  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the 2nd Appellant's  appeal.  I
therefore dismiss the Respondent's onward appeal.

The 1st Appellant's appeal is allowed.

The Respondent's appeal against the 2nd Appellant's decision is dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

A full fee award was made in relation to the 2nd Appellant's  appeal.  As  I
have upheld that decision I do not disturb that fee award.
In relation to the first Appellant's appeal, although I have set  aside  the
decision of the First-tier dismissing her  appeal,  I  do  not  disturb  the
decision not to make a fee  award  since  I  have  only  allowed  the  first
Appellant's appeal on the basis of evidence produced after the  Respondent's
decision.
