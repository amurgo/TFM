                            DECISION AND REASONS






BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The Respondent is a national of Chile. He first arrived in  the  United
    Kingdom on 7 April 1975, when he was eleven years of age.  He  returned
    to Chile in 1978 and remained there until July 1983, when  he  returned
    to join his mother and siblings in the United Kingdom. He  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom on 21 November 1984.

2.   Meanwhile, in 1983, he had married his British wife, who he had met  at
    school when he was previously in the United  Kingdom.  They  had  three
    children together, the first in 1985, the second in 1987 and the  third
    in 1989. Their second child suffers from severe asthma and also  mental
    health difficulties. Their third child suffers from Graves disease  and
    is on the autistic spectrum.

3.   On 12 August 2014 the Respondent was convicted of  fraud  by  abuse  of
    position at Blackfriars Crown Court. The  indictment  stated  that  the
    offence occurred between 31 January 2009 and 1 September 2012. This was
    when he was working for The World  is  Yours  Ltd.   He  had  left  his
    position by mutual agreement in September 2012 and the discrepancies in
    the accounts were identified in September 2013. He had  pleaded  guilty
    to the offence at the first opportunity and  he  was  sentenced  to  16
    months imprisonment on 13 April 2015.  The  sentencing  judge  accepted
    that, although he had betrayed the trust placed in him, he was simply a
    bookkeeper. He was sentenced on  the  basis  that  he  had  not  had  a
    position of power, that the amount involved was around ï¿½82,000 and that
    he had pleaded guilty.

4.   On 26 January 2016 the Respondent was served with a  deportation  order
    and told that he was only entitled to an  out-of-country  appeal.  This
    decision was subsequently withdrawn and he was  served  with  a  second
    deportation order and a decision to refuse his human rights claim on 16
    January 2018. He appealed against this decision and First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Paul allowed his appeal in a decision, promulgated on  13  August
    2018.

5.   The Secretary of State for the Home Department  appealed  against  this
    decision on 17 August 2018 and  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hodgkinson
    granted him permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  30  August
    2018. He stated that "whilst the Judge, clearly and understandably, had
    significant sympathy for the appellant and his  wife,  it  is  arguable
    that he failed to properly apply the relevant undue harshness test, for
    the reasons set out in the grounds".








ERROR OF LAW HEARING

6.   The Respondent relied on a skeleton argument, dated  26  October  2018,
    and also a letter to the Upper Tribunal, dated 3 October 2018, with  an
    attachment. These had not been received by the Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer and we gave him time to read these documents. The  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer addressed us first  and  submitted  that  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Paul had failed to address the higher threshold for  the
    evidence necessary to establish that the unduly harsh test was met.  He
    noted that all three of the Appellant's children were  now  adults  and
    that the evidence did not establish that the two younger children  were
    still significantly dependent on the Appellant and his wife, as  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Paul had found in paragraph 19 of his decision.

7.   We asked the Respondent to clarify which documents had  been  submitted
    at the First-tier Tribunal hearing and he explained that,  although  he
    had brought two large bags of evidence to the hearing, he had only  had
    time to find and  submit  one  document,  which  was  the  letter  from
    Maidstone Hospital, typed on 24 May 2016. He also confirmed that he had
    not previously submitted the letter  from  a  community  mental  health
    nurse, dated 14 June 2016, which was attached  to  the  letter  to  the
    Upper Tribunal, dated 3 October 2018.

8.   We also read out the text of MK (Sierra Leone)  v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) so that the Appellant was
    better able to understand the definition of "unduly  harsh"  which  had
    been adopted by the Upper Tribunal. In response, the Respondent  relied
    on his skeleton argument and stated that he could not expect his  older
    son to support him and that his two younger children could only work on
    a part-time basis. He also stressed that his wife was not  well  enough
    to travel to Chile with him.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION

9.   Section 117C of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    states that:

     "(1)     The deportation  of  a  foreign  national  is  in  the  public
    interest.
     (2) The more serious the crime committed by the foreign criminal,  the
         greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
    (3)  In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been sentenced
    to a period of    imprisonment  of  four  years  or  more,  the  public
    interest requires C's deportation unless     Exception 1 of Exception 2
    applies.
     (4) ...
      (5)  Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship  with  a  qualifying   partner...and  the  effect  of  C's
    deportation on the partner...would be unduly harsh".

10.  The Respondent is a foreign criminal for the purposes of  section  117D
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as  he  is  not  a
    British citizen, had been convicted of an offence in the United Kingdom
    and had been sentenced to a period  of  imprisonment  of  at  least  12
    months.

11.  The Respondent's wife is a "qualifying partner"  for  the  purposes  of
    section 117D as she is a British citizen. In  addition,  the  Appellant
    accepted  that  the  Respondent  is  in  a   genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship with her.  Therefore, the Respondent was clearly  able  to
    meet most of the requirements of section 117C(5) but  he  also  had  to
    show that the effect of his deportation would be unduly  harsh  on  his
    wife.

12.  In paragraph 21 of his decision, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Paul  found
    that "the effect of the  [Respondent's]  deportation  would  be  unduly
    harsh on his wife, and furthermore that it would  be  unduly  harsh  to
    expect her to relocate to Chile".  But in his grounds  of  appeal,  the
    Appellant submitted that "the FTTJ has failed to give clear reasons  as
    to how the high threshold of  unduly  harsh  consequences  are  met  in
    respect of" the Respondent's wife.

13.   In MK (Sierra Leone) the Upper Tribunal found that:

     "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh' does  not
    equate  with  uncomfortable,  inconvenient,   undesirable   or   merely
    difficult. Rather, it poses a  considerably  more  elevated  threshold.
    'Harsh' in this context, denoted something severe, or bleak. It is  the
    antithesis of pleasant or comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the
    adverb 'unduly' raises an already elevated standard still higher".

14.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Paul referred to  the  constituent  parts  of
    section 117C but did not refer to MK  (Sierra  Leone)  or  address  the
    correct meaning of the phrase 'unduly harsh'. He reached  his  decision
    without the benefit of  KO and Others v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2018] UKSC 53 but  we  noted  that  in  paragraph  23  Lord
    Carnwath addressed the meaning of the phrase  and  reached  a  decision
    similar to that of the Upper Tribunal in MK (Sierra  Leone).  He  found
    that "the word "unduly" implies an element of  comparison.  It  assumes
    that there is a "due" level of "harshness", that is a level  which  may
    be acceptable or justifiable in the relevant context. "Unduly"  implies
    something going beyond that level. The relevant context is that set  by
    section 117C(1), that is the public  interest  in  the  deportation  of
    foreign criminals".

15.  In paragraph 19 of his decision, First-tier Tribunal Judge Paul  merely
    took into account the fact that the Appellant had first met his British
    wife in 1975 and that  they  had  been  married  since  1983.  He  also
    accepted her evidence that she had  been  utterly  dependent  upon  the
    Appellant throughout their  marriage  and  that,  in  turn,  their  two
    younger adult children were still significantly dependent upon them. It
    was on this basis that he concluded in paragraph  21  of  his  decision
    that the effect of the Respondent's deportation on his  wife  would  be
    unduly harsh.

16.  He  did  so  despite  the  fact  that  the  Respondent's  wife  was  in
    employment. Their three adult children were also working;  albeit  that
    their daughter and younger son were said to be only able to work  on  a
    part-time basis.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Paul had found that the two
    younger children were still significantly dependent upon their  parents
    but the only evidence of this was that they were  driven  to  work  and
    were accompanied to medical appointments. There was no  evidence  about
    the nature of their employment and no medical evidence apart  from  the
    one letter from Maidstone Hospital, referred to above.  This  confirmed
    that, although the  Respondent's  younger  son  suffered  from  Grave's
    disease, he was asymptomatic at that time. There was no  evidence  that
    he was on the autistic  spectrum  and  the  letter  from  the  hospital
    indicated that he was  able  to  discuss  treatment  options  with  his
    consultant without assistance.

17.  The level of the Respondent's daughter's dependence  should  also  have
    been considered in the context of her letter,  which  stated  that  she
    visited museum and galleries and played around with dogs, want to get a
    promotion at work and pass her driving test.

18.  As a consequence, we also find  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Paul
    reached a decision which was not commensurate with the evidence  before
    him at the hearing.  Further, he did not direct  himself  to  the  high
    threshold necessary to find that the effect on  the  Respondent's  wife
    would be unduly harsh or adequately reason how that threshold  was  met
    in this case.


DECSION

(1)  The appeal is allowed.

(2)  First-tier Tribunal Judge Paul's decision is set  aside  on  the  basis
    that it contained material errors of law.

(3)  We have had regard to paragraph 7.2 of the relevant Senior  President's
    Practice Statement and the nature and extent of  the  factual  findings
    required  in  remaking  the  decision  and  have  decided  that  it  is
    appropriate to remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be  heard
    by a First-tier Tribunal Judge other  than  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Paul and First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson.
