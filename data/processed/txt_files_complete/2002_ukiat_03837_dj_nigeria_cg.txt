                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr J Auburn (counsel instructed by Gill & Co) for the appellant
Mr J Morris for the respondent

   This is an appeal from a decision of an  adjudicator  (Mrs  AK  Simpson),
   sitting at Runcorn on 14 March, dismissing a human  rights  appeal  by  a
   citizen of Nigeria, whose asylum appeal had  already  been  dismissed  by
   another adjudicator (Mr AJ Olson - and leave  to  appeal  refused),  from
   refusal to allow the appellant to remain in this country, following  that
   decision, on 12 June 2001. Leave was given mainly on the basis  that  Mrs
   Simpson (to whom we shall refer as the adjudicator)  had  mistaken  (from
   the rather misleadingly  set  out  CIPU  report)  the  date  of  a  peace
   agreement between the appellant's Itsekiri tribe and the rival  Ijaw,  in
   the Delta State of south-east Nigeria.


2. The adjudicator  thought  this  had  been  made  on  25  June  2001:  not
   surprizingly  in  those  circumstances,  she  did  not  accept  that  the
   appellant  would  currently  be  at  risk   from   the   Ijaw   anywhere.
   Unfortunately it had in fact been on the same date in 1999, and  had  had
   plenty of time to break down. There had been a further agreement  between
   the Ijaw and the Itsekiri on 1 February 2000; but it is quite clear  from
   the second report of Dr  Margrit  Nolte  (a  "country  expert"  from  the
   University of Birmingham Centre of West African Studies), dated 24  April
   2002, and the attached material, that this agreement did not hold either.
   However, any case based on a regional conflict between tribes  raises  an
   obvious point on internal flight, which no-one so far has dealt with.  It
   clearly came as no surprize to Mr Auburn when we raised it.

3. Family life   Also in the grounds of appeal is an article 8 claim,  based
   on the appellant's relationship with  a  British  citizen  called  Soraya
   Abdo. That was not pursued before us, except to the  extent  that  living
   together unmarried might cause them problems, amounting  to  "inhuman  or
   degrading treatment" contrary to article 3 of the Human Rights Convention
   in any Muslim-majority area  of  Nigeria.  As  they  both  say  in  their
   statements that they intend to get married anyway, we do not see that  as
   a real problem. Unfortunately the pregnancy noted  in  Dr  Nolte's  first
   report had ended in a miscarriage on 23 November 2001.

4. We shall briefly consider the position under article 8: though Mr  Auburn
   expressly disclaimed any reliance on that, it may be relevant to the  way
   he did rely on the appellant's domestic situation under article 3.  Since
   Mrs Abdo has two  children,  10  and  5,  born  here  from  her  previous
   marriage, it may not be realistic to  expect  them  all  to  go  back  to
   Nigeria with the appellant if he has to; but on the other hand, there  is
   no reason why, following the decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in  Amjad
   Mahmood [2000] INLR 1, he should not  then  apply  to  rejoin  them  from
   there.

5. If any provisions of the Immigration Rules caused difficulty  with  that,
   then he would be entitled to rely  on  the  Human  Rights  Convention  in
   making his visa application, and on any appeal against refusal.  So  long
   as states respect the right to family life recognized by article 8,  they
   are entitled to take proportionate measures to try to maintain an orderly
   system of immigration control. The real question  before  us  is  whether
   there is anything in this appellant's individual case such that it  would
   amount to "inhuman or degrading treatment"  to  return  him  to  Nigeria,
   despite his illegal entry to this country and the dismissal of his asylum
   claim.

6. Mental state  The feature of the appellant's  individual  case  which  is
   also relied on in connexion with his claim that it would be  "inhuman  or
   degrading treatment" to send him back to Nigeria is his mental state. The
   evidence about this comes from three sources. It may be helpful  to  list
   them, in the context of his history in this country, which follows:

   ??. 03.99      arrives through Dover in boot of car
   25.12.99 arrested by police (we  are  not  concerned  with  why):  claims
   asylum
   09.03.00 seen by Dr J Joyce DTMH (not explained) (for solicitors:  report
   17.03)
   09.06.00 seen again by Dr Joyce: report undated
   till 06.00     detained under immigration powers at HMP Haslar:  goes  to
   London
   03.07.00 seen by Dr CR Shawcross FRCPsych (for Home Office: report 10.07)
   ??.01.01 "dispersed" to Liverpool by Home Office
   ??.03.01 meets Mrs Abdo; they form association  06.01;  she  starts  baby
   08.01
   14.11.01 seen by Dr JS Barrett MRCPsych (for solicitors: report 19.11)
   ??.01.02 moves in with Mrs Abdo



7. The adjudicator noted  that  Dr  Nolte  had  said  there  were  only  two
   "torture counselling centres"  in  Nigeria,  one  in  Port  Harcourt,  an
   overwhelmingly Ijaw town, and the other in Lagos, which  she  said  might
   become  a  battleground  between  the  Ijaw  and  other  groups.  As  the
   adjudicator had taken the view that the appellant would  not  now  be  at
   risk from the Ijaw, even in Delta  State,  she  saw  no  problem  in  his
   getting to either of those centres. However, she went on to say

   In any event, the appellant is  not  currently  receiving  treatment  and
   rarely  uses  medication.  His  return  to  Nigeria  will  not  therefore
   interfere with his treatment.

8. This was the position when the adjudicator sat to hear  the  case  on  14
   March 2002, nearly four months after Dr  Barrett  had  concluded  in  his
   report (pp 107-8) that it would be  best  if  the  appellant  could  talk
   "...to a skilled counsellor, rather than just a sympathetic listener,  as
   this would be likely to speed the resolution of his symptoms." He went on
   to praise the appellant's GP's drugs rï¿½gime: apart from paroxetine in the
   day, and phenergan (well-known to parents of small children) at night, he
   was getting another drug to help  him  stop  smoking:  as  he  was  still
   getting through twenty cigarettes a day, Dr Barrett thought he  might  as
   well be taken off that. So far as  the  current  position  is  concerned,
   there is no further medical evidence before us,  except  for  an  undated
   note from the appellant's GP, referring him  for  "support  counselling",
   which Mr Auburn told us is taking place. The note  says,  under  'Current
   Psychological Treatment/Medication', "none"

9. Dr Joyce has no formal psychiatric qualifications:  his  only  specialist
   qualification appears to be 'DTMH'. Mr Auburn was unable to tell us  what
   that was, but we think it may be the Diploma  in  Tropical  Medicine  and
   Health. Neither side relied on his reports to any extent, and we  do  not
   find them of any particular assistance  at  this  distance  in  time.  Dr
   Shawcross concluded in July 2000:


   He has only been out of Haslar for a few days and I take note of the fact
   that he has already made contact with the lady from Croydon, with whom he
   had  previously  [evidently  meaning  before  his  arrest]  been   in   a
   relationship. At interview with me today he describes symptoms consistent
   with a mild  depressive  disorder  and  he  also  described  to  me  some
   intrusive symptoms that are characteristic of a post traumatic  disorder.
   I am of course only relating information told to me and do not  know  its
   veracity. ...Prior to his arrest in December 1999, although some of these
   symptoms may have been present, to a less severe  extent,  they  did  not
   prevent him from leading a reasonable life on the evidence  available  to
   me.


10. This was Dr Barrett's prognosis in November 2001:


   I think that were he to remain [sic] the UK [the  appellant's]  prognosis
   would be fair. On the other hand Nigeria, the scene of what were  in  all
   probability very traumatic events, would be a location highly  likely  to
   worsen his Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and which might  well  lead  to
   the addition of a depressive disorder with all  the  attendant  risks  of
   suicide and death by self-neglect this entails. It should be  noted  that
   it is likely that Nigeria  would  contain  no  social  support  for  [the
   appellant] and that he would lose the social support of  his  girlfriend,
   as well as their child losing contact with its father.
11. As the use of the neuter pronoun may indicate,  this  was  in  fact  the
   unborn child which Mrs Abdo sadly lost a few days later. Dr Barrett could
   not of course be expected to foresee that; but as well as  commenting  on
   his own area of expertise, he did venture to  look  into  the  future  in
   Nigeria. He does not  suggest  that  he  himself  has  had  any  overseas
   experience: what he says on the point (p 104) is  that  he  has  assessed
   over 150 overseas patients through translators [obviously meaning what on
   this side of the Atlantic are called interpreters] and has experience and
   knowledge of mental health care and the experience of mental illness in a
   wide variety of countries. He does not say how  he  got  it,  except  for
   talking to his patients here.

12. Let us set out a few facts about Nigeria, taken from  the  CIPU  report.
   They will also of course be relevant to the internal flight point. It  is
   a federation of 36 states and the Federal  Capital  Territory  of  Abuja.
   While the last census showed 88.5 million people, the current estimate is
   over 120 million. As well as being the most populous state in Africa,  it
   is one of the largest: the 'Times Atlas of the World' shows its  area  as
   just under 1 million kmï¿½ (United Kingdom just under ï¿½  million  kmï¿½).  Dr
   Barrett's rather airy description of Nigeria  as  "a  location"  suggests
   that, even if he is aware of those facts, he  has  not  taken  them  into
   account  in  any  meaningful  way  in  his  prognostications  about   the
   consequences of the appellant's return there.

13. While we of course accept Dr Barrett's qualifications  to  pronounce  on
   the appellant's  mental  state,  as  observed  by  him,  we  cannot  take
   seriously what he says about the consequences of  return  to  Nigeria  in
   general. We are quite prepared to accept that return to the actual  scene
   of the appellant's claimed  experiences  in  the  Delta  State  might  be
   upsetting for him; but that is not the issue at present. This  appellant,
   as noted by Dr Shawcross, has been able to lead  a  perfectly  reasonable
   life here. He formed a previous relationship with a woman, strong  enough
   to outlast several months in detention. His present  one  continues,  and
   Mrs Abdo speaks highly in her statement of the  emotional  and  practical
   support he gives her and her children.

14. This appellant is clearly a person of considerable  inner  strength  and
   resourcefulness, despite the symptoms noted by  Dr  Barrett,  and  to  an
   extent by Dr Shawcross. The facts behind the  decision  of  the  European
   Court of Human Rights in Bensaid [2001]  INLR  325  are  very  different.
   However, with the general approach of the European jurisprudence in mind,
   we do  not  think  it  could  possibly  be  said  that  this  appellant's
   psychological needs, currently being met by some  "support  counselling",
   without any  psychiatric treatment or medication, would on their own make
   it "inhuman or degrading  treatment"  for  Her  Majesty's  Government  to
   return him to Nigeria.

15. Internal flight    We shall now turn  to  the  question  of  whether  it
   would be unduly harsh (which we shall take as the test  under  the  Human
   Rights, as under the Refugee  Convention)  to  expect  the  appellant  to
   return to some other part of Nigeria than  the  Delta  State,  where  his
   experiences at the hands of the Ijaw took place. We shall of course  bear
   in mind our view of his mental state in considering that. Mr Auburn began
   by relying on the  adjudicator's  acknowledgement  (ï¿½  24)  that  "ethno-
   religious violence" had  occurred  throughout  Nigeria  in  2001.  As  he
   accepted, most of that has nothing to do with the Ijaw/Itsekiri conflict;
   for example, the periodically recurring  trouble  in  the  north  between
   Muslims and Christians (which, as his name suggests, this appellant  is).
   It is for the appellant to show that there is no part of Nigeria  outside
   the Delta State where he would not either be at real risk from the  Ijaw;
   or for some other reason it would be unduly harsh to expect him to go.

16.  The  background  to  the   appellant's   situation   appears   in   his
   supplementary statement. At ï¿½ 6 he says that, since he had to  leave  his
   uncle's house in Lagos, because the uncle complained  that  his  presence
   put him at risk from the Ijaw, he has had no news of his family  at  all.
   We  asked  Mr  Auburn  what  steps  he  had  taken  to  trace  them:   on
   instructions, he told  us  the  appellant  had  got  in  touch  with  the
   International Red Cross after his release from detention and  "dispersal"
   to Liverpool. They had been unable to give him any information; but there
   is nothing from them to confirm that.

17. As we made clear, whether the appellant himself has had any news of  his
   family or not, we are not prepared to accept that they are untraceable in
   Nigeria without confirmation from the International  Red  Cross,  showing
   the details they had been given for their inquiries. This is  a  kind  of
   evidence very often given in this field; and the possibility  of  getting
   it must have been obvious to specialist solicitors such as these.

18. Mr Auburn first addressed the possibility of the appellant going to  the
   north. We have already dealt with  his  point  about  Mrs  Abdo  in  that
   context. The main difficulty put forward is that the north is  a  Muslim-
   majority area, while the appellant is a Christian. The strength  of  this
   point is perhaps rather diluted by the appellant's claim at ï¿½  7  of  his
   supplementary statement that Lagos would also be  difficult  for  him  to
   live in, because it is mixed Muslim and  Christian.  Since  Muslims  form
   about 50%, and Christians 40% of the  population  of  Nigeria  (see  CIPU
   report ï¿½ 5.23), it seems to us that there must be a number of points,  no
   doubt including Lagos, where they may  reasonably  be  expected,  in  the
   absence of evidence to the contrary, to live together  in  some  kind  of
   peace.

19. The evidence about the north  comes  first  from  the  State  Department
   report for 2001. At p 5/27 of the copy before us, details  are  given  of
   the Sharia code punishments in force in 12 (out of the 36) states.  These
   are well-known: they do not apply to Christians (see Human Rights  Watch,
   August 2000, p 8/15), though Christians are  said  to  be  worried  about
   them. Interestingly, the State Department   say  the  Nigerian  appellate
   courts have yet to decide whether they break the prohibitions on  torture
   or "inhuman or degrading treatment", enshrined in that, as  in  most  new
   Commonwealth constitutions. We do not see that they could pose any threat
   of that kind to this appellant.

20. The same is true of the prohibitions on mixed schools, public music  and
   dancing, and the sale of alcohol, referred to further  on  in  the  State
   Department report. We are well aware that there  is  from  time  to  time
   trouble between Muslims and Christians in the north, though we  were  not
   referred to any specific examples of it. There is nothing to suggest that
   it is more than local and periodic in nature, or prevents  the  existence
   of a sizeable Christian minority there. We see no reason why it should be
   unduly harsh to expect the appellant to seek refuge in northern  Nigeria,
   if that were necessary.

21. The next part of the country discussed was Abuja, the  federal  capital.
   Sharia does not apply there, and the appellant was  at  university  there
   from 1995-97 (see his original witness statement). His complaint at  ï¿½  9
   of his supplementary statement is that he has no  connexions  there  now,
   and it is "heavily populated  by Muslims". We are tempted  to  point  out
   that the same now applies to considerable areas of this country. We  have
   not been referred to any evidence of Muslim/Christian disorder in  Abuja:
   no doubt the authorities at the federal seat  of  government  would  come
   down fairly hard on it if there  were  any  signs  of  it.  There  is  no
   evidence that it would be unduly harsh for the appellant to go to Abuja.

22. Then the discussion turned to Lagos. The suggestion  about  the  Muslims
   in the appellant's supplementary statement, is borne out only  by  United
   Nations news reports of  clashes  lasting  four  days  in  February  2002
   between  Yorubas  and  'Hausas'  (apparently   meaning   northerners   in
   general).It seems from the report of 5 February that these began  in  one
   district, and spread to several northern  suburbs  of  the  city,  before
   being brought under "a semblance of control" by police and army patrols.

23. At this point we turn to the overview of Nigerian tribes at  ï¿½  5.59  of
   the CIPU report. There are over 250 of them: in  descending  order,  they
   are the  Hausa/Fulani  of  the  north,  the  Yoruba  of  the  south-west,
   including Lagos, and the Ibo/Igbo of the south-east. Next,  according  to
   Dr Nolte (original report, p 5), come the Ijaw,  with  about  13  million
   people. She says (p 4) the Itsekiri  number  ï¿½  million  or  less:  their
   language is related to the eastern dialects of the Yoruba,  who  live  in
   the states to the west of them, and amount to about 25 million people.

24. The evidence of  Ijaw/Itsekiri  difficulties  in  Lagos  comes  from  Dr
   Nolte's report at pp 10-11. She says the Itsekiri there  were  identified
   with the Yoruba, and involved in riots in 1999 between them and the Ijaw.
   We have  already  mentioned  the  appellant's  evidence  that  his  uncle
   organized for him to leave Nigeria, since  he  took  the  view  that  his
   presence in his house in Lagos put the whole  family  at  risk  from  the
   Ijaw. We were referred to further evidence  in  the  Human  Rights  Watch
   report 2002 (p 2/6) about the vigilante activities of the "Bakassi Boys";
   but those were said to be in the south-east,  and  there  is  nothing  to
   relate them specifically to the Ijaw/Itsekiri conflict.

25. Mr Auburn suggested that the appellant would be at risk  in  Lagos,  not
   only as an Itsekiri, but as the son of an Itsekiri chief. This is to  say
   the least hard to reconcile with the appellant's evidence  that  all  his
   family have gone missing: there is nothing to show, if that is right, how
   he would be identified in that great city as his father's  son.  However,
   for the reasons we have already given (see ï¿½ 17), we do not  accept  that
   even his immediate family are untraceable.

26. Dr Nolte (report p 5) refers to the importance of the  extended  family,
   specifically amongst the Itsekiri. That is certainly in  accordance  with
   our understanding of family life in Africa generally: it would be a great
   mistake to regard it in terms of the  Western  nuclear  model.  She  says
   "Considering that, according to his  evidence,  [the  appellant]  has  no
   family he can contact in Nigeria, it will be extremely difficult for  him
   to re-establish himself in Nigeria". She scrupulously avoids  making  any
   comment of her own on the likelihood or otherwise of someone losing touch
   with all his relations in Nigeria.

27. We should be very surprized to hear  that  the  appellant  was  entirely
   without even extended family contacts in Lagos. From one  point  of  view
   that might make him more  identifiable  there;  from  another,  it  would
   certainly make it easier for him to re-establish himself. While there may
   be more possibilities of risk to the appellant from his origins in  Lagos
   than anywhere else in Nigeria outside the Delta State,  if  only  because
   there are clearly both  Itsekiri  and  Ijaw  communities  living  in  the
   metropolis, we cannot see that it would be unduly harsh to expect him  to
   return even to Lagos. There is nothing to suggest that his Ijaw foes from
   the Delta in 1997 would now have any interest  in  hunting  him  down  in
   Lagos in 2002.

28. Those are the possibilities canvassed by Mr Auburn. It  is  quite  plain
   from the background evidence we have already  mentioned  that  they  only
   cover a part of Nigeria. The appellant's own evidence from Dr  Nolte  for
   example shows that his Itsekiri tribe are strongly  identified  with  the
   very much more numerous Yoruba. There are 25  million  of  them,  and  we
   cannot accept that it would be unduly harsh for this  appellant  to  seek
   refuge somewhere amongst them. We do not see any reason why it should  be
   contrary to Her Majesty's Government's obligations under the Human Rights
   Convention  to  return  him  to  Nigeria.   Despite   the   adjudicator's
   understandable mistake about the date of the peace agreement in the Delta
   State, and consequently about the continuing hostilities  there,  in  our
   view she reached the right result.

Appeal dismissed
