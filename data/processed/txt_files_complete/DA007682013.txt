               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:        Mr J Rene, Barrister
For the Respondent:       Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1) The appellant is Armando (or Andy) Gania, born on 22 November  1989.   In
   late 1998 he entered the UK with his parents, his brother and his sister.
    An asylum claim was made on the basis that they  are  all  from  Kosovo.
   While the full immigration history of the family members  is  not  before
   us, a letter dated 27 February 2006 from  the  respondent  to  solicitors
   acting for the appellant's  father  indicates  that  by  April  2004  the
   respondent had information that the family members are Albanian citizens.
    At least from that date, it appears  that  the  respondent  declined  to
   accept   that   the   appellant   and   his   relatives   are    Kosovan.
   Notwithstanding, following a series  of  applications  and  appeals,  the
   appellant was granted indefinite leave to remain on 13 November 2008,  in
   line with his parents.



2) The appellant has the following criminal convictions:

       14 July 2005, robbery, 2 counts, 6  months'  detention  in  a  Young
       Offender's Institution;
       7 February 2006, possession of a knife, 6 months' supervision order;
       7 July 2006, possession of an offensive weapon in  a  public  place,
       100 hours community service;
       19 March 2007, shoplifting, fined �50;
       4 January 2008, shoplifting, fined �50;
       12 February 2010, robbery, 2 counts, 7 years' imprisonment.

3)  In  consequence  of  the  last  conviction,  the  respondent  served   a
   deportation order on the appellant as a foreign criminal under section  2
   of the UK Borders Act 2007.   The  order  proposed  the  removal  of  the
   appellant to Kosovo (which, he continued to maintain, was  his  place  of
   origin).

4) The Immigration Rules HC395 provide at paragraphs 398 and 399A:

        Deportation and Article 8

        398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
        to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights
        Convention, and
        (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to the
        public good because they have been convicted of an offence for
        which they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at
        least 4 years;
        (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to the
        public good because they have been convicted of an offence for
        which they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less
        than 4 years but at least 12 months; or
        (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to the
        public good because, in the view of the Secretary of State, their
        offending has caused serious harm or they are a persistent offender
        who shows a particular disregard for the law,
        the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider
        whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, it will
        only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in
        deportation will be outweighed by other factors.
        399. [not relevant]  ...

        399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies
        if -
        (a) the person has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20
        years immediately preceding the date of the immigration decision
        (discounting any period of imprisonment) and he has no ties
        (including social, cultural or family) with the country to which he
        would have to go if required to leave the UK; or

        (b) the person is aged under 25 years, he has spent at least half
        of his life living continuously in the UK immediately preceding the
        date of the immigration decision (discounting any period of
        imprisonment) and he has no ties (including social, cultural or
        family) with the country to which he would have to go if required
        to leave the UK.

5) By determination of 14 January  2013  (case  reference  DA/00923/2012)  a
   panel of the First-tier Tribunal allowed the appellant's  appeal  against
   deportation, on the finding that the appellant had no  ties  with  Kosovo
   (our emphasis).

6) Neither party sought to appeal against that outcome.

7) The respondent made a further deportation order,  dated  16  April  2013,
   accompanied by a notice explaining that the  decision  was  made  on  the
   basis that the appellant is Albanian.  The notice narrates (paragraph 20)
   that enquiries  made  with  the  Kosovan  and  Albanian  authorities  had
   established that the family is of  Albanian  nationality,  and  that  the
   appellant's brother and sister hold Albanian passports.

8) The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.   His  grounds  assert
   that  although  he  is  now  adult,  there  would   be   disproportionate
   interference with the family life he has with his parents, and  with  his
   private  life;  that  separation  from  his  parents  would  "create   an
   unbearable and exceptional circumstance for the family"; that deportation
   would be disproportionate, because most  of  his  criminality  was  as  a
   juvenile; and that it was not established "that the appellant  is  not  a
   Kosovan national".

9) First-tier Tribunal Judge Plumptre dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  by
   determination promulgated on 18 June 2013, against which this  appeal  is
   taken.

10) Mr Rene said at the outset of his submissions that the ultimate crux  of
   this case is whether in terms of paragraph 399(A)(a) the appellant has no
   ties with Albania.

11) The first ground of appeal to the Upper Tribunal, at paragraph 2 of  the
   grounds, claims that there is material error in the judge's statement  at
   paragraph 21 of her determination:

    There is now evidence before me that the entirety  of  the  appellant's
    family was born in Puke, Albania and that his brother and arguably  his
    sister are living in the country.


12) Sub-paragraph 2 (i) complains that a family registration document  which
   the respondent produced at the FtT hearing to show the birth place of the
   appellant and his relatives was not translated, and the judge  stated  in
   open court that she could not take it into account for that very  reason.
   Sub-paragraph 2 (ii) is  that  the  judge  was  wrong  to  say  that  the
   appellant's sister is living in Albania, because the evidence showed that
   she has returned to the UK, and resides here as the  wife  of  a  British
   citizen.

13) Mr Bramble had no record from which he could help us as to  whether  the
   judge made the statement suggested.  We were able  to  find  the  judge's
   handwritten record on the file.  It does not  mention  the  matter.    We
   drew Mr Rene's attention to paragraph 13 of the determination, where  the
   judge records submissions from Mr Rene on the weight to be given  to  the
   document, and to paragraph 16, where she records submissions on behalf of
   the respondent on the same issue.  We observed that such  submissions  do
   not sit well with the judge having committed herself to the view that the
   document was not to be taken into account.   The  submissions  appear  to
   have assumed the contrary.

14) Mr Rene accepted that paragraph 2(i) of his grounds might not  take  the
   appellant very far.  He submitted that there was clear  evidence  of  the
   return of the appellant's sister as an Albanian citizen to  the  UK,  and
   that the judge had therefore gone wrong in considering that the appellant
   had ties to Albania through his sister.

15) We observed that by using the word "arguably" at paragraph 21 the  judge
   did not conclude  the  sister  was  necessarily  still  in  Albania.   In
   response, Mr Rene referred us to  paragraph  3  of  his  grounds  and  to
   paragraph 34 of the determination, where Judge Plumptre finds that she is
   entitled to give weight to findings in a previous determination  that  it
   was undisputed the appellant's sister  now  lived  in  Albania  with  her
   husband.  Mr Rene said that was incorrect, and the clear evidence  before
   Judge Plumptre was that  the  appellant's  sister  is  married  to  a  UK
   citizen.

16) Paragraph 4 of the grounds complains that the judge makes confusing  and
   contradictory findings over whether the appellant speaks fluent  English,
   and whether or not he is able to speak Albanian.  The  grounds  say  that
   the judge communicated with the appellant and he  responded  in  English,
   without the use of an interpreter.  Mr Rene accepted that  the  appellant
   had not given any oral evidence, but he said that the judge addressed the
   appellant in English and he had clearly been  able  to  follow  her.   He
   submitted  that  at  paragraph  36  the  judge  "tried  to  dilute"   the
   significance of the fact  that  although  the  appellant's  parents  both
   communicated in Albanian, he was educated in the UK in English.

17) Paragraph 5 of the grounds complains  that  the  judge's  conclusion  at
   paragraph 38 that the appellant had not discharged the burden of  showing
   what is required by Rule 399(A)(a) is unreasoned.  The  judge  refers  to
   "evidence belatedly put forward by the SSHD", but did not say  what  that
   was.  Mr Rene submitted that it must refer to the  untranslated  document
   submitted on the day; that the judge  had  said  she  would  give  it  no
   weight;  and  that  therefore  the  paragraph  contained  no  sustainable
   reasoning.

18)  Paragraph  6  of  the  grounds   criticises   paragraph   39   of   the
   determination.  Sub-paragraph (i) complains that the judge's  finding  on
   the appellant and his family's true nationality is a "subjective opinion"
   reached despite the fact that the appellant was a minor, aged 8, on entry
   to the UK.  Sub-paragraph (ii) complains that in  giving  weight  to  the
   fact that the appellant's grounds of appeal [to the First-tier  Tribunal]
   failed to specify to  which  country  he  has  no  ties,  the  judge  was
   "grabbing at straws".

19) Paragraph 7 of the  grounds  relates  to  Ogundimu  [2013]  UKUT  00060,
   quoted by the judge at paragraph 40, and to the appellant's links through
   his family to Albania.  The  ground  complains  that  links  through  the
   appellant's  brother,  sister  and  mother  are  not  his  direct  links;
   complains yet again that the judge went wrong on whether  his  sister  is
   living in Albania; and  points  out  that  the  appellant's  brother  was
   allowed entry clearance on 29 March 2013 to join his UK citizen  wife  in
   the UK.  The ground argues that the finding that the family members could
   not have returned to Albania if there were no other family members  there
   is "pure speculation ... not supported by any evidence".  Finally, at (v)
   the ground observes that Kosovans need  to  make  their  entry  clearance
   applications at the British Embassy in Tirana.

20) Further to paragraph 7, Mr Rene submitted that  the  appellant  did  not
   necessarily have close links with his brother, because his brother  is  9
   years older, and if he  had  any  real  influence  would  have  kept  the
   appellant free of offending while he was a juvenile.  He said that  there
   was nothing to demonstrate that the appellant's ties with his brother are
   other than biological, and that it  was  relevant  that  the  appellant's
   brother has married a UK citizen and was on the verge of re-entering  the
   UK at the time of the determination.

21) Returning, he said, to the crux of the case Mr  Rene  finally  submitted
   that the judge failed to give weight to the  fact  that  the  appellant's
   offences were committed mainly as a juvenile, in terms  of  Maslov;  that
   the respondent failed to bring evidence which excluded the appellant from
   the application of paragraph 339A(b); and that  the  determination  could
   not stand.

22) Mr Bramble  drew  our  attention  firstly  to  the  family  registration
   document, the subject of paragraph 2 and of other parts of  the  grounds.
   He said  that  both  representatives  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  made
   detailed submissions on the weight to be given to this evidence,  and  so
   even if the judge made  any  prior  comment  about  whether  untranslated
   documents should be admitted, the hearing clearly proceeded on the  basis
   that the document should be evaluated for what it  was  worth.   Although
   the document is untranslated it is plain from the names, dates and places
   of birth shown on it, which are clear without translation  into  English,
   that it is an official record of the family's Albanian origins and  prior
   residence.  Even without that document, there was ample evidence that the
   family is from Albania.    As  to  the  whereabouts  of  the  appellant's
   sister, the determination at paragraph 17 showed that the judge was aware
   that she is now in the UK as the spouse of a UK  citizen.   At  paragraph
   34, the judge was  only  rehearsing  a  prior  finding  on  the  sister's
   previous movements.  That disposed of paragraphs 2(ii) and paragraph 3 of
   the grounds, which essentially raise the same point.  At paragraph 4, the
   grounds reflect only the judge's correct narration of  the  facts  before
   her, and go nowhere as to disclosing error of law.  Paragraph 5 says that
   the  judge  failed  to  supply  reasoning  at  paragraph  38,   but   the
   determination was to be read as a whole.  Paragraphs 17, 39 and 40 of the
   determination made it clear that the judge had good  reason  for  finding
   that the evidence did not disclose absence of ties of  the  appellant  to
   Albania.  His mother, sister and  brother  had  all  returned  there  for
   varying periods.  His brother and  sister  obtained  Albanian  passports.
   His brother was there at the date of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing.
   The appellant's grounds of appeal did not disclose any issue  related  to
   Maslov, and in any event the appellant's significant offending was as  an
   adult, not as a juvenile.

23) Mr Rene in reply said that paragraph  17  of  the  determination  was  a
   record of the submissions for the respondent, not a  conclusion  on  fact
   and  credibility.   Although  the  submissions  acknowledged   that   the
   appellant's sister was back in the UK, the judge went wrong at  paragraph
   34.  While the determination by the previous  First-tier  Tribunal  panel
   had made adverse findings on evidence from the  appellant  and  from  his
   mother, that panel had not focused on the question of ties with  Albania.
   Even if other family members had ties in Albania, the appellant has lived
   here since the age of 8, and during the period when he was free to travel
   in and out of the UK did not appear ever to  have  returned  to  Albania.
   The ties of other family members did not necessarily  mean  that  he  has
   ties there, and the focus should be on him.

24) After  briefly  adjourning  to  consider  the  submissions,  we  advised
   representatives that we had reached the view that there is  no  error  of
   law in the determination, such as to require it to  be  set  aside.   Our
   reasons are as follows.

25) As to paragraph 2 of the grounds, we accept on  the  basis  of  what  Mr
   Rene has told us that when the family registration document was  tendered
   the judge at least made some comment to the  effect  that  a  translation
   ought to have been provided.  The grounds  before  us  are  not  properly
   framed so as to establish any  procedural  impropriety  thereafter  which
   might amount to error of law.  Any such allegation  ought  to  have  been
   clearly made, and accompanied by the evidence by  which  the  impropriety
   was to be established.  Following upon that, the  respondent  would  have
   been expected to provide relevant evidence, and the judge would have been
   asked for her comments.  In this case no such procedure would  have  been
   necessary even if the point of alleged procedural  impropriety  had  been
   properly formulated, because representatives proceeded with the  rest  of
   the hearing on the footing that there was no objection  to  admission  of
   the family registration document into  evidence  without  a  translation.
   They made their submissions not on admissibility, but on the  weight  the
   document should be given.  The Presenting Officer was  correct  to  point
   out to us that the document  is  plainly,  without  translation,  to  the
   effect that the family, including  the  appellant,  is  of  Albanian  not
   Kosovan birth.  That last point  goes  to  a  fundamental  issue  in  the
   appeal, and it is one to which Mr Rene made no response.

26)  As  to  ground  2(ii),  the  determination  is  not  entirely  free  of
   contradiction on  whether  the  appellant's  sister  was  thought  to  be
   residing in Albania at the time of the hearing.  However,  we  think  the
   judge broadly understood that the appellant's sister had  re-entered  the
   UK.  The more significant points were that she returned  to  Albania  and
   that she obtained her permission to re-enter the UK as an Albanian.   The
   judge was correct in noting that the appellant's brother was  in  Albania
   for  similar  reasons  and  was  entitled  to  take   that   as   further
   demonstrating links to Albania.

27) If any slight error is disclosed by paragraph 2 of the  grounds,  it  is
   not one which might have made any difference.  Ground 3 discloses nothing
   further to ground 2(ii).

28) On ground 4, Mr Rene's submissions did not enlighten us as to how  there
   could be any legal error in the judge's  inability  at  paragraph  36  to
   determine whether or not the appellant speaks fluent English, and whether
   or not he is able to speak Albanian.  Nor did Mr  Rene  explain  how  any
   such error might aid the appellant's case.

29) We observe, for what it  matters,  that  if  anything  the  judge  might
   readily have found  that  the  appellant  is  bilingual  in  English  and
   Albanian.  We think that would be the only sensible conclusion  from  all
   that is known about him.

30)  Ground 5 criticises paragraph 38 as if it stood alone, but it states  a
   conclusion the reasoning for which is to be found  in  the  rest  of  the
   determination, in particular at paragraphs 39 and 40.

31) From paragraph 6 of the grounds it is  difficult  to  derive  any  clear
   proposition of error of law.  The judge was entitled to take  account  of
   the obvious fact that the appellant's family members  have  lied  through
   multiple  proceedings  and  hearings  about  their  origins.   Far   from
   "grabbing  at  straws",  the  appellant's   failure   to   put   anything
   intelligible forward regarding his origins was a point rationally  to  be
   taken against him.  The fact that he was aged 8 on entry to the  UK  does
   not make it any more likely that he, uniquely in his family,  is  Kosovan
   rather than Albanian.  The judge's conclusion on nationality is far  from
   a subjective opinion.  It is the conclusion also reached by the  previous
   panel; it is the thrust of the evidence; and it is  rather  difficult  to
   see how any judge  might  sensibly  reason  that  the  appellant  is  not
   Albanian.

32) As to Ground 7 we can see no error in a judge concluding that  the  fact
   that an appellant's close relatives have ties in another  country  yields
   an inference that he has similar  ties,  both  directly  and  indirectly.
   Absent evidence that an individual was estranged from his  relatives,  we
   do not see what other inference would follow; and the appellant  says  in
   his grounds that he is unusually close to his parents.  The relevance  of
   Kosovans having to apply in Albania for  entry  clearance  is  nil.   Any
   applicant has to do so by  proof  of  nationality,  and  the  appellant's
   relatives made their applications on the basis of  Albanian  nationality,
   not of Kosovan origin.

33) Mr Rene did not refer directly to Maslov.  The  reference  which  should
   have been given is app no 1638/03, ECtHR, [2009] INLR 47.  As Mr  Bramble
   pointed out, there is no related ground  of  appeal  before  us.   Maslov
   establishes (paragraph 75) that for a settled migrant  who  has  lawfully
   spent the major part of his childhood and youth in the host country, very
   serious reasons are required to justify expulsion, the more so where  the
   offences underlying expulsion were committed  as  a  juvenile.   In  this
   case, the significant offending was as a young adult.  We  are  satisfied
   that the FtT proceeded on the correct  principles.   There  is  no  legal
   error in the effective finding that the very serious reasons  to  justify
   expulsion were present.

34) Some confusion runs through the  prior  history  of  these  proceedings,
   including  the  determination  in  case  DA/00923/2012,  the  appellant's
   grounds of appeal both in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  in  the  Upper
   Tribunal, and  in  the  determination  now  under  appeal.   The  judge's
   determination  would  have  benefited  from  further  proof-reading   and
   revision.  For example, this would have led to the deletion of  paragraph
   339A  of  the  Rules,  which  is  set  out  in  full.   Although  neither
   representative mentioned the point, this paragraph of the Rules seems  to
   have no relevance and to have been quoted in error rather than  paragraph
   399A.  The judge should also have made it clear for what purposes she was
   quoting the earlier determination, which would have left no  doubt  about
   her understanding of the sister's whereabouts.

35) It may be helpful to take a step back from points of  confusion  and  to
   undertake a reality check.  The underlying source of uncertainty  is  not
   so much the judge as the lies told by the appellant and his family  since
   their entry to the UK.  The appellant even  now  puts  forward  no  plain
   statement of his understanding of his origins, but he  has  not  disputed
   that his brother and sister are Albanian and has  not  explained  how  he
   might not be so.  He has chosen to sit back  and  try  to  leave  obscure
   matters which must be readily within his  knowledge.   He  is  not  in  a
   position to complain when obvious adverse inferences are drawn.

36) While  preparing  this  determination  we  note  a  further  point,  not
   mentioned on either side.  The respondent's decision at paragraphs  37  -
   42 deals with the case under paragraph 399A of the  Rules  on  the  basis
   that the appellant has lived in the UK for half his life until  the  date
   of decision, but that it is not considered that there are no ties to  the
   country to which he is to be deported.  The appellant seems to have  been
   sentenced to 42 months on each  of  two  counts,  the  sentences  to  run
   consecutively.  Both sides have referred to that as a sentence of 7 years
   imprisonment, and the appellant has not  suggested  that  it  might  mean
   anything else for present purposes.  If we read paragraphs 398  and  399A
   correctly, the effect of the appellant having been sentenced to a  period
   of imprisonment of 7 years is that he falls within 398(a) not (b) or  (c)
   and so should not have been given the benefit of the test  of  "ties"  in
   399A.  That would have lowered the test within the Rules to  "exceptional
   circumstances".  But in any event, on the higher test of "ties", his case
   was correctly dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal.

37) Our conclusion is that any error by the judge was in  not  finding  with
   greater clarity that (i) the appellant is not Kosovan  but  Albanian  and
   (ii) it is (much) more likely than not that he retains  social,  cultural
   and family ties with Albania.

38) No anonymity order has been requested or made.

39) The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is  dismissed.   The  determination  of
   the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

                                Judge of the Upper Tribunal
