Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Jaisri instructed by Sam Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Sreeraman, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The application  for  permission  to  appeal  was  made  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer but nonetheless I shall refer to the parties as  they
    were described  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  is  Mr  Ramesh
    Adhikari as the appellant and the Entry Clearance Officer, New Delhi as
    the respondent.





The Appellant

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal born on 9 August 1987 and  applied,
    on 18 February 2014, for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 3. That application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer on 6 August
    2014 on the basis that the appellant did not meet the income  threshold
    requirement  under  Appendix  FM  and  all   the   related   evidential
    requirements under Appendix FM  SE.   It  is  a  requirement  that  the
    sponsor needed a gross income of at least �18,600 per annum.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer stated that the sponsor was employed  as  a
    staff trainer with McDonald's earning �14,611 per annum and was  an  IT
    officer with Podamine Limited earning �366.56 per month.  However,  the
    most recent pay slips from McDonald's were dated 5 October  2013  which
    was more than 28 days before the application and the  most  recent  pay
    slips from Podamine Limited were dated December 2013  which  were  more
    than 28 days prior to the date of  the  application.   Appendix  FM  SE
    required that the appellant provide specified evidence  relating  to  a
    period which ended with the date of the application and the application
    was therefore refused under paragraph ECP.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of  the
    Immigration  Rules  (E  -  ECP  3.1).   The  Entry  Clearance   Officer
    specifically  set  out  to  satisfy  the  financial  requirements   the
    appellant was required to submit the following  documents  relating  to
    their sponsor

           - 'six months wage slips (latest pay slip  must  be  no  earlier
             than 28 days before the date of application).

           - bank statements corresponding to the  same  six  month  period
             (latest bank statements must be no earlier than 28 days before
             the date of application).

           - letter from employer confirming employment type salary  length
             of employment and period paid salary for'.

 5. In the event the appeal was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Miles
    on 24 June 2015.

 6. An application for permission to appeal was  made  on  the  basis  that
    Appendix FM SE of the Immigration Rules sets out exacting  requirements
    of the type of corroborative evidence  that  it  is  necessary  for  an
    applicant to provide to make out their claim.  Among  the  requirements
    are that wage slips  and  corresponding  bank  statements  need  to  be
    provided for the six months prior to the date of application.  In  this
    case that means the sponsor needed to provide  this  evidence  for  the
    whole of the period 18 August 2013 to 18 February 2014.

 7. It was clear from the  Tribunal's  findings  at  paragraph  14  of  the
    determination that this evidence was not before the 'court'.   Instead,
    the Tribunal made findings based on the credibility of the sponsor this
    was unacceptable and could not replace the requirements  of  the  Rules
    for the purposes of any assessment under 276ADE (sic) of the Rules.  It
    thereby followed that the conclusion of the Tribunal was wrong in  law.



 8. At the hearing  Ms  Sreeraman  submitted  that  the  judge  misdirected
    himself in relation to law under Appendix FM SE.  The  relevant  period
    was from August 2013 to February 2014.  The appellant had presented pay
    slips from July 2013 and then produced at the hearing further pay slips
    from McDonald's.  She  claimed  she  received  payments  from  Podamine
    Limited but the evidence regarding the February pay slip was not in the
    bank statement.  The judge should have looked at the  totality  of  the
    evidence and it was clear that the following three issues fell short of
    the requirements.  The January and February  Podamine  pay  slips  were
    absent.  With regard to the employer's letter that fell short of the 28
    day requirement as it  was  dated  23  October  2013  and  further  the
    appellant needed to show the Podamine deposits in the bank statement of
    February 2014.

 9. The appellant had not demonstrated the requirements under  Appendix  FM
    SE.  There was a further point that whilst the judge  was  entitled  to
    take into account the earnings  from  McDonald's  she  had  only  shown
    �15,919 from the pay slips to December.  At the end of December she had
    earned �18,118 when including the pay  slips  from  Podamine  and  thus
    there was an insufficiency of income to amount to �18,600.

10. Mr Jaisri indicated that the specified evidence could be  divided  into
    two - that from McDonald's and that from Podamine.  The point was  that
    the appellant had stated  that  she  had  included  all  the  necessary
    evidence as part of her application and this had been  referred  to  in
    the judge's findings for example McDonald's had reconfigured their  pay
    slips and these new pay slips had been  sent  to  the  respondent.   Ms
    Sreeraman did not have those on file but it is  clear  that  those  pay
    slips were reflected in the bank statements and  what  was  before  the
    decision maker.

11. Mr Jaisri stated that the only absent pay slip was that of  31  January
    2014 from Podamine which was not before the Entry Clearance Officer and
    the pay slips from July to December were before the Secretary of State.
     That absent pay slip of 31 January 2014 was produced before the  judge
    on the date of the hearing.  Mr Jaisri considered that the judge  could
    consider that under Section 84(5)(a) or alternatively the matter should
    have been considered under paragraph 245AA.

12. Mr Jaisri submitted that the income from Podamine could  be  determined
    from  the  bank  statements.   I  was  referred  to  the  Halifax  Bank
    statements which were before the Secretary of State.  The deposits from
    page A75 onwards showed salary from Podamine employer at  the  rate  of
    �293.33 per month which was the net equivalent of a  gross  payment  of
    �366.53 per month.  Mr Jaisri submitted that this should be  scaled  up
    on an annual basis and for twelve months would  be  the  equivalent  of
    �4,398 as a salary from Podamine.  He submitted that the 28 day  period
    should only apply to the bank statements and pay slips and not  to  the
    employment letters.  All bar one pay slip was produced  which  was  the
    January pay slip from Podamine.

13. Ms Sreeraman pointed out that the letter  from  the  employer  made  no
    reference to the gross annual salary and if the judge had proper regard
    to the employer's letter he would not have allowed the  appeal  because
    the employer's letter was not in the prescribed format.

14. Mr Jaisri pointed out that the grounds of appeal could not  be  widened
    to include everything that was deficient because it would mean that the
    Secretary of State could merely refer to the fact that an appellant had
    not complied with the Immigration Rules  without  more.   He  submitted
    that the December 2013 pay slip was before the Entry Clearance Officer.

15. I considered whether the judge was in error in his  assessment  of  the
    evidence.  At paragraphs 12 he assessed the income from McDonald's  and
    would appear to refer to evidence  of  the  appellant's  earnings  from
    McDonald's by way of her P60 for the year ending  5  April  2014  which
    stated that her gross earnings were �15,919.  That was an error because
    the judge should have been looking  at  evidence  as  at  the  date  of
    application which was in fact in February 2014.

16. That said the requirement is for the bank  statement  and  payslips  to
    fall within the 28 day period of the date  of  application  which  this
    instance it was 18th February 2014.  The period can run to 20th January
    2014 to fulfil the requirement.  The pay slips for  31st  January  2014
    for McDonalds were said to have been submitted by the sponsor and  thus
    did run up to  within  28  days  of  the  application.    Even  if  the
    appellant had not provided those payslips the Secretary of State  could
    have requested those pay slips because they form part of a series under
    Appendix FM SE(D)(b)(i) (aa)(documents missing from a series).  The pay
    slips which were said to be submitted with the application from  August
    2013 to January 2014 demonstrate an income of �7,989.22 gross.  That is
    the equivalent of the salary of �15,978.44.  Although it was maintained
    that the letter was not sufficient there is no doubt that a letter  was
    produced from McDonald's and genuine pay slips were  produced  and  the
    judge accepted that the appellant had been employed by McDonald's since
    November 2011 and continued to be employed by them and  that  the  bank
    transfers  into  her  account  were  reflected  in  the  Halifax   Bank
    statements  which  showed  the  relevant  regular  credits  and   which
    corresponded to the net payments identified in the  pay  advice  slips.
    Her gross earnings,  when  analysed  from  the  six  months  pay  slips
    provided and which should have been  considered  by  the  Secretary  of
    State indicated a six  monthly  income  of  �7,989.22  with  an  annual
    equivalent of �15,978.44.  The judge's assessment was in  fact  �15,919
    albeit that it was taken from the wrong  evidence.   I  therefore  that
    there is an error of law but on the papers before  me  I  proceeded  to
    consider whether it is a material error of law.

17. The judge also at 13 found that there was a letter  from  Podamine  and
    that there were pay advice slips for the totality of the  period  until
    31 December 2013.  There were pay slips also provided  for  the  period
    from July 2013 until 31 December  2013  and  the  sponsor  produced  an
    advice slip dated 31  January  2014.   Once  again  the  payments  were
    reflected by deposits into the bank account of a net payment of �293.33
    and related to an equivalent gross payment of �366.53 per  month.   The
    appellant had been working for this company for six months prior to the
    application and the judge found that on the basis of gross earnings  of
    �2,932 that that was an  annual  equivalent  sum  of  �2,932.   At  the
    hearing before me Ms  Sreeraman  confirmed  that  in  fact  before  the
    Secretary of State were the pay slips until December 2013.   Hence  the
    Secretary of State was in fact correct in the refusal letter  to  state
    that the pay slips were 28 days outside of the time but  once  again  I
    find  that  the  series  could  have  been  requested  under  paragraph
    245D(b)(i)(aa).  There was clear evidence in the bank statements of the
    corresponding sum of payments from Podamine.

18. The sponsor maintained that she had produced the payslips  and  bearing
    in mind the originals payslips produced and the bank statements showing
    her income I have no reason to doubt this would have been the case. Had
    the one further pay slip from Podamine  (and  if  necessary  McDonalds)
    been requested even on the basis of gross earnings to  date  of  �2,932
    from Podamine the appellant's salary reached  �18,910.44.  I  therefore
    find that the income of �18,600 per annum had been demonstrated because
    from the earnings of McDonald's were the equivalent of �15,978.44.

19. There was clearly evidence which was placed before the Entry  Clearance
    Officer which was not considered and extending  the  principle  in  the
    case of Mandalia v SSHD [2015] UKSC 59, I consider that that  evidence,
    which formed part of a series, should have been requested.  The payslip
    from Podamine could be  seen  to  be  available  evidence  because  the
    Halifax bank statement dated 31st January 2014, and  which  was  before
    the Entry Clearance because it  was  in  the  Entry  Clearance  bundle,
    showed the wage payments from both McDonalds and from Podamine on  30th
    and 31st January 2014 respectively.  Both these  payments  were  within
    the 28 day period and the wage slips and consistent bank  deposits  for
    the previous six months had been supplied.  The wage slips were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal and by that I mean the evidence which  predated
    the date of the application.

20. There was criticism by Ms Sreeraman of the letters from  the  employers
    because they did not comply with the 28 day period.  I do not find that
    this 28 day limit attaches to the letters but rather the bank statement
    and payslips.   It  is  correct  that  Appendix  FM-SE  (l)  imposes  a
    requirement of a 28 day period prior to  the  date  of  application  in
    relation to 'evidence relating to a period which ends with the date  of
    the application'.  That applies to the payslips and the bank statements
    but FM-SE does not impose such a time restriction or confinement on the
    employer's letter.

21. Even if that is not correct, as pointed out in the  decision  of  Judge
    Miles, no objection was made regarding the employers'  letters  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer at the appeal hearing before him and I consider
    it too late to raise the issue of the letters before the Upper Tribunal
    when this was not a matter which was specifically taken  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer prior to the actual  hearing  before  me  or  in  the
    permission to appeal.

22. For completeness the permission to appeal referred to Paragraph  276ADE
    which is an application to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of
    private life.  This was in fact an out of country application for entry
    clearance to join a spouse and thus the reference to 276ADE appeared to
    be made in error.

23. I therefore find that there was no error of law made by the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge which was material to  the  outcome  and  therefore  the
    decision shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
