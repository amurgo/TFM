Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Reid (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Troup promulgated on the 8th August 2016  in  which  he
      dismissed the Appellant's protection appeal on asylum and humanitarian
      protection grounds and further dismissed the Appellant's Human  Rights
      appeal.

   2. It was the Appellant's case before the First-tier  Tribunal  that  his
      father was engaged as a smuggler, who smuggled alcohol  from  Iraq  to
      Iran and that from time to time over the 4 years up to  and  including
      2015, the Appellant  would  help  his  father  and  brother  in  their
      smuggling activities.  It is his case that on one  occasion  in  about
      May 2015, the Appellant's father and brother left home  in  the  lorry
      supplied by a man named Hamid, for  whom  they  worked,  in  order  to
      collect contraband goods but they did not return home and  it  is  his
      case that they had been arrested and that the police had been  to  the
      family home, had carried out a search and had asked for the Appellant.
       It is his case that he fled the country, arriving in the  UK  on  the
      10th June 2015.

   3. In his findings, Judge Troup at [39] found that "I take  into  account
      that when the Appellant left Iran in May 2015 he  was  just  16  years
      old.  I have found that he was not a party to the offence for which he
      says his father and brother were arrested, and I conclude that  he  is
      of no interest to the  Iranian  authorities  whatsoever".   First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Troup went on to consider  the  Appellant's  risk  upon
      return between paragraphs [40] and [44] of the decision  and  did  not
      accept that the Appellant had come to the attention of the authorities
      in Iran and therefore found that it could not  be  the  case  that  he
      would be detained solely because he left the country illegally,  after
      considering the expert report, but also considering the  then  country
      guidance case of SB (Risk on Return - Illegal  Exit)  Iran  CG  [2009]
      UKAIT 00053.

   4. Within the Grounds of Appeal it is argued at ground 1 that the  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge erred in his assessment of the standard of  proof,
      and at ground 2 that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to make  any
      findings on the risk to the Appellant upon return as an  unaccompanied
      minor with no safe reception facilities. In ground 3 it is argued that
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge had wrongly concluded that  the  central
      issue in the Appellant's claim was his failure  to  mention  that  his
      father and brother had been tortured in prison, and in ground 4 it  is
      argued that the Judge's assessment of the Appellant's credibility  was
      flawed and that  the  Judge  had  given  insufficient  weight  to  the
      material evidence when assessing the Appellant's  credibility  in  the
      form of the objective and expert evidence before him. At ground  5  it
      is argued that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  erred  in  failing  to
      assess the risk on return to Iran based upon the  Appellant's  Kurdish
      ethnicity, and at ground 6 that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
      erred in placing a disproportionate amount of weight  on  the  country
      guidance case of SB (Iran) without referring to the current background
      situation.

   5. Permission to appeal was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  E.B.
      Grant on the 12th September 2016, limited to grounds  2  and  5  only,
      namely ground 2 in respect of the alleged failure  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge to make any findings on the risk to  the  Appellant  on
      return as an unaccompanied minor with no  safe  reception  facilities,
      and in respect of ground 5 that the First-tier Tribunal Judge is  said
      to have erred in failing to assess the risk on returning to Iraq based
      on the Appellant's Kurdish ethnicity.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant
      did not give permission to appeal on the other grounds of appeal.   He
      found that the decision did not reveal that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge had applied the wrong standard of proof and made  findings  that
      were open to him in terms of the Appellant not being a genuine refugee
      in need of international  protection.   Judge  Grant  considered  that
      there were significant discrepancies in the Appellant's  accounts  and
      that the Judge was entitled to find that if  the  Appellant  had  been
      told his father and brother had been detained and  tortured  that  was
      too important to omit from the screening interview or  in  his  asylum
      statement.

   6. The Appellant sought to renew the  Grounds  of  Appeal  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal, but Upper Tribunal Judge Smith on  the  11th  October  2016,
      refused to  grant  permission  on  grounds  1,  3,  4  and  6  of  the
      Appellant's Grounds of Appeal.  Although Judge Smith accepted that  it
      was implicit from what was said at paragraph 31 of the  decision  that
      the Judge accepted that the Appellant's father and  brother  had  been
      arrested in relation to the smuggling operation, she found that it was
      not accepted by the Judge that they had been tortured  and  that  they
      would have disclosed the Appellant's identity as a result.  She  found
      that it was clear that the Judge had not misunderstood the Appellant's
      case as regards the risk he faced and that the Judge had given reasons
      at paragraph  38  for  discounting  the  expert  evidence  as  to  the
      treatment of Kurds in prison, because the Judge did not accept on  the
      evidence that the Appellant would be put into prison  because  he  did
      not accept that the authorities would have taken an  interest  in  the
      Appellant for the reasons he gave.  Judge Smith found that in light of
      the country guidance decision of SSH  and  HR  (Illegal  Exit:  Failed
      Asylum Seeker) (CG) [2016] UKUT 308 (IAC) that the Judge's  conclusion
      in relation to the Appellant's illegal exit at  paragraph  44  of  the
      decision was open  to  him.   She  found  that  ground  5  upon  which
      permission had already been granted concerned the risk on return to an
      ethnic Kurd and that the Judge had properly relied upon SB  (Iran)  in
      relation to risk upon returning due to illegal exit.

   7. In the Rule 24 reply dated the 29th September 2016 from the Respondent
      it is argued that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  directed  himself
      appropriately and that there is no material error of law in respect of
      ground 5 on the basis of SSH  and  HR  (Illegal  Exit:  Failed  Asylum
      Seeker) (CG) [2016] UKUT 308 where  it  was  said  that  it  had  been
      conceded by the Appellant there was no risk on return to  Iran  merely
      on the basis of Kurdish ethnicity at paragraph 34 and that the  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge had gone  on  to  make  the  findings  which  were
      sufficient regarding the Appellant not being at risk  upon  return  in
      exiting Iran illegally, which  is  said  to  be  consistent  with  the
      country guidance.  In respect of ground 2 it is argued that the  Judge
      was fully aware of the fact that the Appellant  was  an  unaccompanied
      minor and that he would not be removed until he turned 18 years old as
      per the UASC policy, having been found that he was not  a  refugee  as
      his claim was not credible.

   8. It was on that basis the appeal came before me in the Upper Tribunal.

   9. In her oral submissions, Miss Reid argued that the First-tier Tribunal
      Judge had not properly considered the risk to the Appellant based upon
      his Kurdish ethnicity and although there was  reference  to  the  fact
      that the Appellant was of Kurdish ethnicity at paragraph  41  and  the
      fact that the Appellant said that  that  would  enhance  the  risk  he
      faced, that had not been properly considered by the  Judge.  She  said
      that within the Skeleton Argument it had been argued specifically that
      as a result of his ethnicity he was vulnerable and faced a risk due to
      his ethnic background.  She argued that the risk came  not  only  from
      him being involved in smuggling  or  his  perceived  involvement  with
      smuggling, but also from illegal exit and his ethnicity, and his  age.
      She argued there  was  no  proper  consideration  of  the  Appellant's
      Kurdish ethnicity.

  10. Miss Reid further sought to argue that even if the authorities did not
      know that the Appellant was specifically involved in smuggling on  the
      occasion when his father and brother were arrested,  she  argued  that
      the expert report in the case had indicated that smuggling  was  known
      to be a family activity  and  that  if  members  of  the  family  were
      involved in smuggling, then the authorities  might  believe  that  the
      Appellant was  involved  because  he  was  a  member  of  the  family.
      However, she conceded that the Appellant had not sought to  appeal  on
      that basis, and permission to appeal had  not  been  granted  on  that
      basis.  I therefore  did  not  allow  her  to  pursue  that  argument,
      permission to appeal not having been granted in that regard.

  11. Miss Reid then sought to argue that age was also one  of  the  factors
      that had to be considered in respect of the risk and that  as  at  the
      date of the decision, the Appellant was only 17 years old and that  he
      would be returning as a male who lacked the protection of  his  father
      and brother and who would be returning to his mother as a lone  female
      and that no consideration had been given to the risk in  that  regard,
      linked with the fact that he was  of  Kurdish  ethnicity.   Miss  Reid
      argued that even though the Appellant will not be returning  until  he
      was 18, his leave will expire when he was 17�, and was due  to  expire
      this month on the 21st October 2016, and that in  such  circumstances,
      the Judge's failure to consider whether  in  fact  the  Appellant  was
      entitled to asylum, humanitarian protection  or  protection  on  Human
      Rights grounds based upon his age and Kurdish ethnicity, did amount to
      a material error of law, in that if  that  had  been  considered,  the
      Appellant would be granted leave until he was 18.

  12. Mr Walker on behalf of  the  Respondent  argued  that  the  Judge  had
      properly taken account the fact that the Iranian authorities were  not
      aware of any crime to which the Appellant was a  party  and  that  the
      Judge had found that the Appellant's name will not be on any  list  of
      wanted individuals who had left the country and who would be  arrested
      for their crimes upon return,  as  suggested  by  the  expert  in  her
      report, given the Judge's findings at  paragraph  42.   He  said  that
      there was no risk upon return based upon past criminality.  He  argued
      that the Judge was aware of the  Appellant's  age  when  he  left  the
      country and had said specifically the Appellant was aged  16  when  he
      left at paragraph 39 of the decision.  He argued  that  the  Appellant
      would, if returned post the age of 18, be  returning  in  a  situation
      where he would be the head of the household with his mother  and  that
      the Appellant did leave with an Iranian  passport  when  he  left  and
      argued that at worst the Appellant would be returning with  a  laisser
      passer.

  13.  However, Mr Walker agreed and conceded that the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge had not seemingly considered the  Appellant's  age  specifically
      when considering risk upon return and conceded that that  should  have
      been considered when considering whether  or  not  the  Appellant  was
      entitled to humanitarian protection.

  14. Mr Walker argued that even if I were to find that there were  material
      errors in law, in terms of whether  or  not  the  Judge  had  properly
      considered the Appellant's Kurdish ethnicity and his age in respect of
      the risk upon return and if the case were to be  reconsidered  by  the
      First-tier Tribunal, the Appellant would  be  entitled  to  raise  any
      further Article 8 arguments at that stage, he argued that there should
      be preserved findings of fact in respect of the findings of the  Judge
      at paragraphs 39 and 42 of the decision, in respect of  the  Appellant
      not being a party to the offence for which he said that his father and
      brother were arrested and the authorities not being aware of any crime
      to which the Appellant was a party and his name not being on any  stop
      list.  However, Mr Walker and Miss Reid both  agreed  that  the  final
      part of the last sentence at paragraph 39 of the decision that "and  I
      conclude that  he  is  of  no  interest  to  the  Iranian  authorities
      whatsoever", should not be preserved, if there were a  material  error
      of law found on the case remitted.

   My Finding on Error of Law and Materiality

  15. At paragraph 41 of  the  decision,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Troup
      states:

           "It is the Appellant's  case  that  the  'pinch  point'  at  the
           airport is where the risk lies upon return.   There  will  be  a
           record of him and the risk is enhanced by being a failed  asylum
           seeker.  He left the country illegally and has no passport.   He
           is coming up to draft age and it is unlikely that he could  have
           left the country legally in any  event.   Suspicion  would  fall
           upon him, and his Kurdish ethnicity enhances  the  risk  factor.
           The Country Information Guidance: Iran: Kurds - August  2015  at
           pages 85-114 addresses the treatment of Kurds,  particularly  at
           paragraph 4.1.1, 4.1.6 and 4.1.15-16".

  16. The First-tier Tribunal Judge therefore did mention the fact that  the
      Appellant's case was that his Kurdish ethnicity enhanced the risk that
      he faced, but although the Judge found that  the  Iranian  authorities
      would not be aware of any crime to which the Appellant was a party and
      that his name will not be on any list of individuals who  were  wanted
      having left the country and who will be arrested for crimes upon their
      return, the Judge has not  specifically  dealt  with  the  Appellant's
      Kurdish ethnicity when dealing with the extent to which that either of
      itself or linked with other factors, would mean that he  would  be  at
      risk upon return.

  17. In this regard, I do bear in mind, as argued by the Respondent in  the
      Rule 24 reply, that  at  paragraph  34  of  the  most  recent  country
      guidance case of SSH and HR (Illegal Exit: Failed Asylum Seeker)  (CG)
      [2016] UKUT 308, at paragraph 34 of that:

           "It was not suggested to us that an  individual  faces  risk  on
           return on the sole basis of being  Kurdish.   It  was,  however,
           agreed that being Kurdish was relevant to how a  returnee  would
           be treated by the authorities.   For  example,  the  Operational
           Guidance   Note   refers   at   3.12.14   to   the    government
           disproportionately targeting minority groups,  including  Kurds,
           for arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention and  physical  abuse.
           No examples however  have  been  provided  of  ill-treatment  of
           returnees with no relevant adverse interest factors  other  than
           their Kurdish ethnicity, and we conclude that the evidence  does
           not show risk of ill-treatment to such  returnees,  although  we
           accept it  might  be  an  exacerbating  factor  for  a  returnee
           otherwise of interest".

  18. In this regard, although First-tier Tribunal Judge Troup clearly found
      that the Appellant would not be of adverse interest to the authorities
      based upon his involvement in the smuggling activities for  which  his
      father and brother were said to have been detained, as the authorities
      would not know of his involvement, it is argued by the Appellant  that
      this still does amount to a material error, in that it  is  maintained
      by the Appellant that the Judge's failure to consider  the  effect  of
      the Appellant's Kurdish ethnicity in proper detail in respect  of  his
      risk upon  return,  is  still  a  relevant  factor,  given  that  when
      considering the risk upon return, the Judge has also,  it  is  argued,
      failed to take into account the fact that  the  Appellant  would  have
      been returning as an unaccompanied minor.

  19. In respect of the second ground of appeal, that the Judge  had  failed
      to make any findings on the risk to the Appellant on returning  as  an
      unaccompanied minor with no safe reception  facilities,  although  the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge was clearly aware of the fact the  Appellant
      was just 16 years old when he had left Iran  and  stated  as  such  at
      paragraph 39 of the decision, the Judge has not seemingly factored  in
      the Appellant's age and the fact he was still under 18  years  of  age
      and was only 17, in the analysis  of  the  risk  upon  return  between
      paragraphs 40 and 44 of his decision.   There  is  only  reference  at
      paragraph 41 to the fact he  was  coming  up  to  draft  age,  but  no
      reference to the fact that he was a minor.

  20. As was stated by the Tribunal  in  the  case  of  LQ  (Age:  Immutable
      Characteristic) Afghanistan v The Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2008] UKAIT 00005, age is an immutable  characteristic  in
      that although it changes all of the time, one cannot  do  anything  to
      change one's age at any particular time.  In the case of  LQ,  it  was
      determined that the Appellant as an orphan  child  was  at  risk  upon
      return  due  to  the  lack  of  adequate   reception   facilities   in
      Afghanistan.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Troup in this case has  failed
      to consider, when considering the risk on return, the  fact  that  the
      Appellant would at that stage have been returning as an  unaccompanied
      minor, and failed to consider whether or not  there  would  have  been
      adequate reception facilities  upon  return.   It  is  argued  by  the
      Appellant that there will not be adequate facilities,  given  that  he
      will be returning as an unaccompanied minor to a home where his father
      and brother had been arrested, and he would be returning solely to his
      mother and would therefore  lack  male  protection.   The  issue  upon
      whether or not there are sufficient reception facilities  for  someone
      who would, if they were to be  returned,  would  be  returning  as  an
      unaccompanied minor, has not been considered by the Learned First-tier
      Tribunal Judge, when dealing with the risk upon return.

  21. Although it is argued  by  the  Respondent  that  in  any  event,  the
      Appellant would not be returned until he turns 18 years old as per the
      UASC policy, I find that the Judge has failed  to  consider  both  the
      Appellant's age, the fact that he was still a minor, and  his  Kurdish
      ethnicity, properly, when considering the risk upon  return.  Had  the
      Judge considered that either on the basis of his age alone  or  linked
      with his Kurdish ethnicity, that the Appellant was at a real risk upon
      return, and had the Judge allowed the appeal on the basis of the  risk
      of return, then the Appellant would in  such  circumstances,  had  the
      Judge considered he was at risk upon return, been entitled  and  would
      have been granted leave expiring upon his 18th birthday.   As  it  is,
      the Appellant's leave expires, I am told on  the  21st  October  2016,
      when he turns 17�.

  22.  Mr Walker on behalf of the Respondent conceded  that  had  the  Judge
      allowed the Appellant's appeal, he would  have  been  given  leave  up
      until his 18th birthday, rather than the leave that he  currently  has
      that expires when he is 17�.  Mr Walker also  properly  conceded  that
      this would have an effect upon the entitlement  of  the  Appellant  to
      receive benefits as a person with leave,  rather  than  someone  whose
      leave expires.  I therefore do consider that even though the Appellant
      may not be returning until he is 18, in any event, the fact  that  the
      Judge did not properly consider whether the Appellant was at risk upon
      return and whether his appeal should be allowed on  that  basis,  does
      amount to a material error of law, in  that  it  has  had  a  material
      effect upon the question as to whether or not the Appellant has  leave
      which expires when he is 17�, or would have been granted  leave  until
      his 18th birthday and his entitlement to receive benefits  and  status
      for a long period of time than would otherwise be the case.

  23. I therefore do consider and find that there has been a material  error
      of law in respect of the Judge failing to properly consider whether or
      not the Appellant is at risk based upon his Kurdish ethnicity and also
      in respect of his age, given that he was a  minor  at  the  time,  and
      based upon a combination of those factors and further on the basis  of
      a combination of such factors.

  24.  In such circumstances, I do set  aside  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Troup to the extent that he finds that the Appellant is
      not at risk upon return, but I do preserve the findings of the  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge at paragraph 39 that "I  take  into  account  that
      when the Appellant left Iran in May 2015, he was just 16 years old.  I
      found that he was not a party to the offence which he says his  father
      and brother which arrested".  I further maintain the Judge's  findings
      of fact at paragraph 42 of the decision that  "as  I  have  found  the
      Iranian authorities are not aware of any crime to which the  Appellant
      was a party, it is less than realistically likely that the Appellant's
      name is on any such list".  I therefore maintain the Judge's  findings
      in respect of the fact that the Appellant is not of  interest  to  the
      authorities based upon his involvement in the smuggling operation  for
      which his father and brother were said to have been  involved  in  and
      that his name would not be known to the authorities as not having been
      disclosed to them by his father and brother, and of torture.

  25. However, despite those preserved findings, clearly, the  issue  as  to
      whether or not the  Appellant  is  entitled  to  asylum,  humanitarian
      protection and/or protection on the basis  of  his  Human  Rights,  in
      light of his Kurdish ethnicity  and  age,  and  any  further  evidence
      wished to be given by the Appellant in respect of Article 8, given the
      fact that the Article 8 claim  will  need  to  be  considered  in  the
      further hearing before the First-tier Tribunal as at the date  of  re-
      hearing.  I therefore do set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Troup,  as  to  the  extent  considered  above,  save  that  the
      preserved findings in respect of him not being a party to the  offence
      for which his  father  and  brother  were  arrested  and  the  Iranian
      authorities not being aware of any crime for which the Appellant was a
      party and him not being on any list of wanted  individuals.   I  remit
      the case back to the First-tier Tribunal  for  re-hearing  before  any
      First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Troup.

Notice of Decision

The decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Troup  does  contain  material
errors of law and is set aside, save for  the  preserved  findings  of  fact
detailed above.

I remit the case back to the First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing  before  any
First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Troup.

I do make an anonymity direction, given  that  an  anonymity  direction  was
made by the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  it  appears  appropriate  for  such
anonymity direction to be maintained, given the Appellant is still a  minor,
and is therefore vulnerable.  The Appellant is granted anonymity in  respect
of these proceedings.  No record or  transcript  of  these  proceedings  may
refer to the Appellant by name, either directly or indirectly.   Failure  to
comply with this direction may lead to contempt of Court proceedings.


Signed
R F McGinty
Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McGinty                                 Dated
