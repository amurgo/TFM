Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Haji, Counsel, for Duncan Lewis & Co, Solicitors,
Harrow
For the Respondent:    Ms Alex Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on  1  April  1991.   He
    appealed against the Secretary of State's decision dated 24  June  2013
    dismissing his asylum claim, his claim on the  humanitarian  protection
    issue and his claim on human rights grounds.  His appeal was  heard  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge J J Maxwell and dismissed in a  determination
    promulgated on 14 August 2013.

 2. An application for permission to appeal  was  made  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant and permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal V. A. Osborne  on  9  September  2013.   The  grounds  of
    application state  that  the  appeal  came  about  6  years  after  the
    appellant had made his original application. The respondent had  argued
    that the appellant had absconded but it was  found  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge that this was not the case.  The grounds of  application
    state that the  appellant  has  been  treated  unfairly  and  has  been
    deprived of remedies which would have been available  to  him  had  the
    respondent dealt with his application within  acceptable  time  limits.
    The grounds argue that the First-tier Tribunal Judge's consideration of
    the appellant's Article 8 rights are flawed as no weight  was  attached
    to the delay by the respondent.


The Hearing

 3. Counsel for the appellant submitted that she is relying on the  grounds
    of application.  She submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
    law by finding that the appellant was not a minor.  This  deprived  him
    of the right to a fair hearing.  This  issue  was  not  raised  in  the
    refusal letter. The respondent accepted the appellant's Afghan passport
    which shows he was born on 1 April 1991 and a passport is proof of age.
      The judge made reference to an age assessment report by Barnet Social
    Services.  Counsel submitted that the appellant was  unaware  that  age
    was an issue until he received the determination. On the  date  of  the
    hearing the appellant had not  seen  the  report  and  the  report  was
    prepared after a 20 minute interview. She submitted that the  appellant
    had no chance to challenge it and so did not have a fair hearing.   She
    submitted that as  a  minor,  the  respondent  had  responsibility  for
    tracing the appellant's family in Afghanistan and the appellant  should
    have been granted discretionary leave until he was 17ï¿½ years  old.  She
    submitted that thereafter, if it was found  that  he  was  at  risk  on
    return he would have been granted ILR as a refugee.  She submitted that
    the appellant was not interviewed until 2013 so he lost these benefits.
     Counsel submitted that because of the delay the appellant  missed  the
    deadline for legacy cases by 4 months and has been prejudiced.

 4. I was referred to paragraph 395C of the Immigration Rules and the  Home
    Office Policy CH 53 EIG.  Counsel submitted that the  circumstances  of
    the case have to be considered as a whole and not individually and  the
    appellant's  length  of  residence  in  the  UK  is  a  compelling  and
    significant factor.  She submitted that  the  4  year  policy  was  not
    considered and had it been, the appellant could well have been  granted
    leave to remain. She submitted that unfairness is the result.

 5. Counsel referred to the Article 8 claim and EB Kosovo [2008]  UKHL  41.
    She submitted that this appellant's  Article  8  claim  was  considered
    under the new Immigration Rules but should have been  considered  under
    the old Rules and should have been considered under the Legacy  scheme.
    I was referred to the case of Mohammed  [2012]  EWHC  3091  (Admin)  at
    paragraphs 34-36. In Mohammed it is stated that 4-6 years residence  in
    the UK may be considered significant but a more usual example would  be
    6-8 years.  She submitted that in 2011 the appellant had  been  in  the
    United Kingdom for 4 years.  Paragraph 46 of Mohammed deals  with  Rule
    395C and Counsel submitted that the appellant in this case has been  in
    the UK for between 4 and 8 years.  The respondent delayed the case  for
    6 years and this should result in a grant of leave as there has been  a
    change or an alteration of a substantive criterion for leave to remain.
     Weight should be placed on significant periods of residence  and  this
    is a factor which weighs against removal.

 6. Counsel submitted  that  the  determination  is  unreasonable  and  the
    proportionality assessment has not been properly carried  out.   I  was
    referred to the determination at paragraphs 45 and 46.  The  First-tier
    Judge accepted that the appellant is in a relationship.   He  has  been
    with his girlfriend for 3 years.  The judge put limited weight on  this
    because his girlfriend stated that she does not know  what  the  future
    holds but this should not diminish the weight put on this relationship.
    His girlfriend  states  that  she  will  go  to  Afghanistan  with  the
    appellant if he has to go, but her mother will not  let  her.   Counsel
    submitted that the judge refers to Article 8 and the relevant case  law
    but he does not apply it.  The judge states that the appellant and  his
    girlfriend can keep in touch electronically  and  he  can  go  back  to
    Afghanistan and apply for a residence card but that is not  the  issue.
    The issue is the present relationship and his girlfriend's inability to
    leave the United Kingdom.  I was asked to set aside the determination.

 7. The Presenting Officer submitted that although she does not have a full
    copy of the age assessment report she has a letter from  Barnet  Social
    Services stating that the age assessment concludes that  the  appellant
    is over 18 years old.  She submitted that the appellant must have  been
    told about this and did not challenge the age assessment at any time.

 8. The appellant's representative  stated  that  the  appellant  had  been
    unaware of the letter and it was not produced at the hearing.

 9. The Presenting Officer submitted that she accepts that there has been a
    delay but based on the refusal letter and the Barnet  Social  Services'
    letter, the judge was entitled to come to the  decision  he  did.   She
    accepted that the appellant missed out on some  things  he  would  have
    been entitled to, if he had been found to be a minor but  it  had  been
    found that the appellant was over the age of 18 when  he  came  to  the
    United Kingdom so the respondent did not require to try  to  trace  the
    appellant's family in Afghanistan.

10. With regard to the Legacy issue, there has been no decision  under  the
    Legacy process.  I was referred to the case of  AZ  Afghanistan  [2013]
    UKUT 00270 (IAC).  The Headnote in this case states "Where an appellant
    in an asylum appeal has previously been informed that his case has been
    considered as a Legacy case but no decision under the process had  been
    made, a subsequent immigration decision following a  rejection  by  the
    Secretary of State of his asylum claim  is  not  rendered  unlawful  by
    reason of the failure to make a decision under the Legacy process."

11. With regard to paragraph 395C, the Presenting  Officer  submitted  that
    this claim is distinguishable from the said  case  of  Mohammed.   This
    claim does not need to  be  considered  under  paragraph  395C.  I  was
    referred to the case of Aysha Khanum & Others [2013] UKUT 00311  (IAC).
    This states that paragraph 353B is not designed  to  replace  paragraph
    395C.  The decision whether to carry out a review or  not,  within  the
    scope of paragraph 353B, is entirely at the discretion of the Secretary
    of State.

12. With regard to Article 8 and  the  appellant's  relationship  with  his
    girlfriend, the Presenting Officer submitted that the  judge  does  not
    dismiss this out of hand.  What he does is find that  the  relationship
    is in its infancy.  The couple has not decided  to  stay  together  for
    life.  For Article 8 to be engaged this is required.  The appellant and
    his girlfriend are  not  in  a  relationship  akin  to  marriage.   She
    submitted that there is no error.

13. The Presenting Officer submitted that she is relying  on  the  Rule  24
    response which refers to paragraph 14 of the determination. This  deals
    with the appellant's age.  The judge states that the  appellant's  then
    representatives were aware of the age assessment but it was  never  the
    subject of any challenge so the judge found that the appellant was over
    18 years at the date of his application.  The Rule 24  response  states
    that Ground 1 of the application suggests that the  appellant  was  not
    given an opportunity to challenge the age issue and was deprived  of  a
    fair  hearing  because  he  was  taken  by  surprise  but  his  current
    solicitors would have been in receipt of the Home Office bundle and  so
    he would have been on notice as to what the issues were.  The  response
    states that the judge was entitled to find on the basis of  the  Barnet
    Social Services' report of 9 August 2007 that the appellant was  not  a
    minor and that was never challenged by way  of  judicial  review.   The
    appellant at the date of the decision was well over the age of  18,  so
    the respondent did not require to consider  matters  which  might  have
    been material had he been a minor, e.g. the respondent did not  require
    to trace the appellant's family members.  As the appellant was found to
    be over the age of 18 he would  not  have  been  granted  discretionary
    leave.  The application was made on 7 August 2007.  A  Legacy  case  is
    when an application is made prior to 5 March 2007.  The respondent  has
    not made specific reference to paragraph 353B and  CH  53  EIG  in  the
    refusal letter but the application was considered under the Immigration
    Rules, Appendix FM and 276ADE and the considerations are much the  same
    as the said policy so the appellant has not been prejudiced in any way.



14. The response goes on to state that the challenge to the judge's finding
    on private life and  the  appellant's  girlfriend's  oral  evidence  is
    merely a disagreement with the findings of fact made and the judge took
    into account the respondent's delay.  He acknowledges this at paragraph
    44.

15. Counsel for the appellant submitted that  proportionality  relating  to
    private and family life is  not  simply  resting  on  the  relationship
    between the appellant, his girlfriend and her mother, the delay has  to
    be taken  into  account.   Because  of  the  delay  the  appellant  has
    strengthened his ties to the UK.

Determination

16. The determination of the First-tier Judge refers to the appellant being
    in the charge of Barnet Social Services, who found him to be  over  the
    age of 18 on 9 August 2007.  His immigration history is  that  at  this
    time Social Services ceased  to  support  him  and  he  instructed  the
    Refugee Council to act  for  him.   It  is  therefore  clear  that  the
    appellant knew he was found to be over 18 years of  age  and  this  was
    never challenged. The Barnet Social Services' letter was  sent  to  the
    Refugee Council and to Chartwell and Sadler,  Solicitors  London  on  9
    August 2007, so it cannot be argued that the appellant was  unaware  of
    it.  The judge finds that the appellant was  not  an  absconder.   This
    goes in the appellant's favour in the balancing exercise.

17. As the appellant was over 18 when he lodged his claim for asylum he was
    not entitled to the benefit accruing as a result  of  the  respondent's
    policy on unaccompanied asylum seeking children and there was  no  duty
    on the respondent to make enquiries to trace  the  appellant's  family.
    The judge states that the appellant  falls  outside  the  criteria  for
    having his  claim  dealt  with  under  the  Legacy  policy,  as  to  be
    considered under that policy the appellant  would  need  to  have  been
    abiding his claim and resident in the United Kingdom for a minimum of 6
    years.  Many of the  grounds  of  application  are  covered  under  the
    heading "Immigration History" in the determination.

18. At paragraph 16 the judge states "The unwarranted delay is  not  to  be
    disregarded as it is a matter which is of significance in  relation  to
    any Article 8 claim that might arise  and  certainly  shall  not  be  a
    matter which counts against him in relation to any credibility findings
    I may make." He has clearly taken this into account.

19. At paragraph 22 (vii) the judge refers to  the  appellant's  girlfriend
    and his girlfriend's mother.  He is aware of the relationship  and  the
    extent of the relationship and deals with this adequately. They are not
    in a relationship akin to marriage.

20. At paragraph 29 the judge  refers  to  the  appellant's  representative
    directing him to a number of passages in the  background  material  and
    stating that much  of  this  would  have  been  relevant  only  if  the
    appellant was  a  minor.   The  judge  was  entitled  to  come  to  the
    conclusion that the appellant knew that he had been found to be over 18
    years of age.

21. With regard to Article 8 the judge refers to the relevant case law  and
    the appellant's, his girlfriend's and her mother's  Article  8  rights.
    At paragraph 44 the judge deals with proportionality.  He considers the
    fact that the appellant claimed asylum immediately on arrival  but  the
    respondent did not interview him until June 2013. He  finds  that  this
    was not the appellant's fault.  He takes all the facts into account and
    explains his decision. All matters have been dealt with properly by the
    judge. There is no error of law in the judge's determination.


                                  DECISION

22. As there is no error of law in the judge's determination, his  decision
    must stand.  The appellant's appeal is therefore  dismissed  on  asylum
    grounds, humanitarian protection grounds and on human rights issues.

23. Anonymity has been directed.
