(London)
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    The Appellant appeals against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge B A Morris promulgated on 29 March 2018 ("the Decision"). By the
      Decision the  Judge  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
      Respondent's decision dated 19 April 2016  refusing  her  a  permanent
      right of residence as the former family member of Mr M  Grossmann  who
      is a national of the Czech Republic.

2.    The Appellant is a national of Nigeria.  She married Mr  Grossmann  on
      8 May 2010.  Her divorce  from  him  was  pronounced  absolute  on  11
      September 2015.  The decree nisi was made on 8 May 2015 and  according
      to evidence recounted at [9] of the Decision, the couple separated  in
      January 2015 and the  Appellant  began  divorce  proceedings  in  that
      month.

3.    The Judge did not accept  that  Mr  Grossmann  was  exercising  Treaty
      rights at the date of the decree absolute or that  the  Appellant  had
      lived in the UK in accordance with the Immigration (European  Economic
      Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations") for a continuous period
      of five years as the EEA Regulations require.

4.    The Appellant raises two grounds.  First, it is said  that  the  Judge
      erred by imposing a threshold figure  when  considering  the  evidence
      whether Mr Grossmann had been exercising Treaty rights and  over  what
      period.  The Appellant  says  that  the  issue  is  only  whether  the
      earnings show that the  EEA  national  was  involved  in  genuine  and
      effective economic activity over the period.  In addition,  the  Judge
      applied  the  wrong  date  to  the  issue  whether  Mr  Grossmann  was
      exercising Treaty rights in the  UK;  according  to  the  judgment  in
      Baigazieva v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]  EWCA
      Civ 1088, the relevant date is the institution of divorce  proceedings
      and not the date when the divorce is concluded.

5.    Second, and following on from ground one, the Appellant says that  the
      Judge should have accepted that there is evidence  that  Mr  Grossmann
      exercised Treaty rights for the period from 2011 to 2016 and therefore
      that the Appellant is entitled to a permanent right of residence.   In
      the alternative, she  says  that  the  Judge  should  have  considered
      whether regulation 10  of  the  EEA  Regulations  entitles  her  to  a
      retained right of residence.

6.     Permission  to  appeal  was  refused  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Grimmett on 19 July 2018 but, following renewal of the application  to
      this Tribunal, permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley
      on 6 November in the following terms (so far as relevant):

           "...  [3] The grounds of appeal contend, in  summary,  that  the
           First-tier Tribunal erred in the consideration of  the  evidence
           of the sponsor's self-employment by failing to apply the correct
           test of whether the work done was genuine and effective economic
           activity and by failing to consider whether the EEA national was
           a qualified person at the date  of  initiation  of  the  divorce
           proceedings, and thus failed to  accept  that  the  sponsor  had
           exercised Treaty rights from 2011 to 2016, a five year period.


           [4]   The grounds are all arguable."


7.    The matter comes  before  me  to  assess  whether  the  Decision  does
      disclose an error of law and to re-make the decision or remit  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing.




Submissions

8.    Mr Khan pointed to [16] of the Decision.  He  said  that  the  Judge's
      conclusion that Mr Grossmann was  not  exercising  Treaty  rights  was
      based on an analysis comparing his income  to  the  minimum  level  of
      earnings to qualify  as  an  EEA  national  exercising  Treaty  rights
      according to DWP's website. Mr Khan said that the test is  not  linked
      to any specific level of income but rather whether the EEA national is
      economically active.  Mr Lindsay pointed out that  the  Judge  adopted
      this approach because this is the way in which both parties  submitted
      she should proceed. In response, Mr Khan pointed out  that  the  Judge
      was not bound to accept concessions made by the parties if those  were
      wrong in law.  He said that, based on the evidence of  Mr  Grossmann's
      earnings in 2014-15, the Appellant would be able to succeed.

9.    Mr Khan relied in particular on what is said by the Tribunal in  Begum
      (EEA - worker -  jobseeker)  Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  00275  (IAC)  the
      headnote to which reads as follows:

           "(1)  When deciding whether an EEA national is a worker for  the
           purposes of the EEA Regulations, regard must be had to the  fact
           that the term  has  a  meaning  in  EU  law,  that  it  must  be
           interpreted broadly and that it is not conditioned by  the  type
           of employment or the amount of income derived.  But a person who
           does not pursue effective and  genuine  activities,  or  pursues
           activities on such a small scale as to  be  regarded  as  purely
           marginal and ancillary or which have no  economic  value  to  an
           employer, is not a worker.  In  this  context,  regard  must  be
           given to the nature  of  the  employment  relationship  and  the
           rights and duties of the person  concerned  to  decide  if  work
           activities are effective and genuine."

10.   Mr Khan accepted that the Appellant's ground two can only  succeed  if
      ground one is made out.

11.   Mr Lindsay accepted (following  the  Court  of  Appeal's  judgment  in
      Baigazieva) that the Judge erred in taking as the  relevant  date  for
      establishing whether Mr Grossmann was  exercising  Treaty  rights  the
      date of the decree absolute.  He did at one point  suggest  that  this
      could not be material because there was no evidence  as  to  when  the
      divorce proceedings were instituted but  accepted,  as  I  have  noted
      above, that the Appellant said that she  started  the  proceedings  in
      January 2015 ([9] of the Decision).  He also accepted that  the  issue
      in relation to whether a person is exercising Treaty rights is whether
      the economic activity  is  genuine  and  effective.   I  have  already
      recorded  his  submission  that  the  Judge  was  led  to   follow   a
      mathematical approach  by  the  parties.    In  any  event,  he  said,
      although there is evidence of some income in the relevant five  years'
      period, that does not show a continuous period  of  exercising  Treaty
      rights and accordingly the Appellant could not succeed.  A  preferable
      course for her would be a fuller  application,  if  necessary  relying
      only on a retained right of residence.



Discussion and Conclusions

12.   I begin with the Judge's conclusions leading to the dismissal  of  the
      appeal as follows:

           "[15] The Appellant must show, on a  balance  of  probabilities,
           that her husband was exercising Treaty Rights  at  the  date  of
           Decree Absolute and resided in the United Kingdom in  accordance
           with the Regulations for a continuous period of  five  years  as
           required by Regulations 15(1)(b) and 15 (1)(f).   The  Appellant
           has been well aware of this requirement and, indeed, the hearing
           listed in August 2017 was adjourned to enable her  to  make  the
           relevant enquiries.  She did not do so, but, as I have  set  out
           above, those enquiries were made of HMRC by Ms Cunha on 12 March
           2018.  The results of those enquires  are  contained  above  and
           they  have  not  been  disputed  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant.
           Further, although the Appellant stated in evidence that she  had
           met with family members  of  the  EEA  national  in  the  United
           Kingdom, there is no evidence before  me  that  she  has  sought
           their assistance in obtaining necessary information from the EEA
           national concerning his exercising Treaty Rights in  the  United
           Kingdom.


           [16]  The information provided by HMRC discloses  that  for  the
           tax year 2014-15 the EEA national received  ï¿½2,624.96  and  JSA.
           The period and length for which he received  such  allowance  is
           not known, but the fact that he was in receipt of  such  benefit
           shows that  he  was  a  jobseeker  at  some  point  during  that
           financial year.  The guidance provided by Mr  Afzal  shows  that
           for jobseekers there is a "relevant period".   An  EEA  national
           may not be a jobseeker  for  longer  than  the  relevant  period
           unless they  can  provide  compelling  evidence  that  they  are
           continuing to seek employment and have a genuine chance of being
           engaged.  If the EEA national cannot satisfy  this  requirement,
           then they cease to have a right of  residence  as  a  jobseeker.
           The figures for the financial year 2015-16  show  that  the  EEA
           national received ï¿½4,645.45 from self-employment, but the  self-
           assessment tax return was  returned  to  sender.   There  is  no
           information as to when the EEA national earned that money during
           that twelve month period, but  it  is  clearly  lower  than  the
           threshold figure of ï¿½8,060 (ï¿½155 x 52).  Mr Afzal  asked  me  to
           find that the figure of ï¿½4,645.45 was earned by the EEA national
           in the first six months of that twelve month  period  and  that,
           therefore, the EEA national was exercising Treaty Rights at  the
           date of the Decree Absolute.  I find that there is  no  evidence
           upon which such a finding could be based and, indeed,  there  is
           no evidence before me to show that the EEA national was  in  the
           United Kingdom at the date of Decree Absolute, let alone that he
           was in the United Kingdom exercising Treaty Rights.


           [17]  For all the matters set out above and taking the  evidence
           as a whole, which I do, I find that the Appellant has not shown,
           on the balance  of  probabilities,  that  the  EEA  national  as
           residing  in  the  United  Kingdom  in   accordance   with   the
           Regulations for a continuous period of five years  or  that  the
           EEA national was exercising Treaty Rights in the United  Kingdom
           at the date of the divorce."

13.   The main evidence before Judge Morris as to  Mr  Grossmann's  earnings
      in the relevant period is set out at [7] of the Decision and  emanates
      from enquires made by the Respondent by telephone to HMRC.  That shows
      that Mr Grossmann earned the following amounts:

           2011/12: ï¿½3,050.56 from self-employment.


           2012/13: ï¿½1,113 from self-employment. He was also in receipt  of
           JSA.


           2013/14: ï¿½10,300 from self-employment.


           2014/15: ï¿½2,624.96 from self-employment.  He was also in receipt
           of JSA.


           2015/16: ï¿½4,645.45 from self-employment.


           2016/17: ï¿½11,980.88 from PAYE income.

14.   There are certainly some deficiencies in that  evidence,  particularly
      when coupled with the Appellant's  evidence  recited  at  [9]  of  the
      Decision that Mr Grossmann would leave the United Kingdom for  periods
      of two to three months which makes it very difficult to ascertain  for
      what period of which year he was present and working or claiming  JSA.
      For that reason, I  do  not  accept  Mr  Khan's  submission  that  the
      evidence shows that Mr Grossmann has been exercising Treaty Rights for
      a continuous period of five  years  on  the  face  of  that  evidence.
      Further analysis is likely to be required.

15.   However, even if the Appellant cannot succeed in showing that  she  is
      entitled to permanent residence, the issue for the  Judge  is  whether
      the Respondent's decision breaches the Appellant's rights under EU law
      which may also include in this case a  right  to  retained  residence.
      That was not considered.  The fact that the Judge considered  at  [16]
      of the Decision whether there  was  evidence  that  Mr  Grossmann  was
      exercising Treaty rights at the date of divorce may be  an  indication
      that she had this in mind.  However, that paragraph and her conclusion
      about that is founded on an error as to the relevant date.   It  would
      therefore have  been  necessary  for  her  to  consider  the  evidence
      concerning 2014/15 and not 2015/16.  That may make  little  difference
      since, if anything, Mr Grossmann  earned  less  in  the  former  year.
      However, he was also in receipt of JSA for part of that year.

16.   Further, and in any event,  there  is  nothing  on  the  face  of  the
      Decision to suggest that the Judge  has  addressed  her  mind  to  the
      central issue whether the evidence shows that Mr Grossmann's  economic
      activity during the period in question (or at the  date  when  divorce
      proceedings were instituted) was genuine and effective.   Even  if  Mr
      Grossmann was out of the UK for periods of a few  months  at  a  time,
      that does not necessarily preclude a finding that  he  was  exercising
      Treaty rights during the period in question (although the dates of his
      absence may be relevant to retained rights).

17.   For those reasons,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  Decision  contains  a
      material error of law.  I therefore set aside the Decision.   Mr  Khan
      submitted that, if I found a material error of law, I should remit the
      appeal.  Mr Lindsay was content to leave that issue to me.

18.   I have had regard to the Joint Practice Statement  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal and Upper Tribunal concerning the disposal of appeals in this
      Tribunal.  That reads as follows:

           "[7.2]      The Upper Tribunal is likely on each  such  occasion
           to proceed to re-make the decision,  instead  of  remitting  the
           case to the First-tier Tribunal, unless the  Upper  Tribunal  is
           satisfied that:-


              a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party  before
                 the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  a  fair  hearing  or   other
                 opportunity  for  that  party's  case  to  be  put  to  and
                 considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or


              b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which  is
                 necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-
                 made  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the   overriding
                 objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to
                 the First-tier Tribunal."

19.   Although the Judge has done her best with  the  evidence  before  her,
      there are no findings about what I have concluded is the central issue
      in this case.  I am therefore satisfied  that  it  is  appropriate  to
      remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing before
      a Judge other than B A Morris.  The First-tier Tribunal  may  consider
      it appropriate in light of what I say above to direct  the  Respondent
      to make further enquiries of HMRC and DWP in order to  obtain  written
      information about Mr Grossmann's self-employment and employment record
      and the periods during which he was in receipt of JSA.


DECISION

I am satisfied that the Decision involves the making of a material error  on
a point of law. The  Decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  B  A  Morris
promulgated on 29 March 2018 is set aside.  The appeal is  remitted  to  the
First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing before a different Judge.
