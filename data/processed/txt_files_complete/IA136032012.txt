Representation:

For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Portugal, appeals with  permission  against
    the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Braybrook and Mrs W Jordan) which  dismissed  his  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision to deport him to  Portugal.   The  appellant  was
    born in 1990 and is now 23 years old.  He was  represented  by  Counsel
    before the First-tier Tribunal but has appeared in person in  both  the
    recent hearings before the Upper Tribunal.

 2. As a Portuguese citizen,  the  appellant  is  also  an  European  Union
    citizen to whom the  Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 apply when his removal is contemplated.

Background

 3. The appellant came to the United  Kingdom  in  1994,  accompanying  his
    Portuguese mother who  was  exercising  Treaty  rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  On his own account, he began using cannabis when he was about
    15 years old (in 2005 or thereabouts).  He later  graduated  to  heroin
    and gambling, and by the time of the index offence he  was  in  serious
    debt to his drug dealers (for approximately �6000).   He opted to repay
    his drug debts by embarking on a  month-long  robbery  spree  in  local
    bookmakers, choosing those furthest from the police station  and  using
    an imitation firearm.  There were between nine and  eleven  attacks  on
    bookmakers'  shops  in  that  one-month  period.   In  each  case,  the
    appellant wielded the gun and his elder brother was the getaway driver.
     A number of other local youths accompanied them.

 4. On 21 August  2009,  the  appellant  pleaded  guilty  at  the  earliest
    opportunity to one count of attempted robbery, six counts of having  an
    imitation firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence, and five
    counts of robbery.   The  sentencing  judge  considered  that  even  an
    imitation firearm caused  'terror'  to  the  staff  of  the  bookmakers
    attacked, 'associated with the belief it may be used'.   He  considered
    that the appellant, despite his age, was 'a committed criminal prepared
    to  commit  crimes  of  the  greatest   seriousness'.   The   appellant
    steadfastly refused to name the other persons involved, apart from  his
    brother, and confirmed at the hearing before me that he was  still  not
    prepared to do so.

 5. The appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years in a  young
    offender prison; he did not appeal his sentence.   His brother received
    the same sentence and was subsequently deported to Portugal.  While  in
    prison the appellant took a number of courses.  His sentence  ended  on
    16 January 2012; he was then  detained  under  immigration  powers  and
    notified  of  the  intention  to  deport  him.   He  was  released   on
    immigration bail on 12 February 2012.

 6. A letter from the London Probation Trust on 15 June 2012 concerning the
    appellant had stated that he was considered to have reduced his risk of
    reoffending to Medium from High at the point of sentencing.  The letter
    continued:

         "The definition of  Medium  risk  of  harm  being  that  there  are
         indicators to point to a potential risk to  the  public  (e.g.  the
         circumstances of the index offences) but that those indicators  are
         not currently evident and unless there is a significant  alteration
         in circumstances, such risk is not likely to be evidenced.

         My assessment of Mr Muzinga is that he has used his time in custody
         to good effect.  I understand it is his  wish  to  become  a  fully
         qualified  plumber  and  to  that  end  he  has  been   undertaking
         vocational  courses  while  in  HMYOI  Portland  to  realise   that
         objective. He is well regarded by the prison staff who have regular
         contact with him and has been afforded 'Enhanced Status'  for  some
         considerable time.  Furthermore he has acted in the r�le of  mentor
         for other young inmates.

         As stated I have visited the family home where  I  have  spoken  to
         family members.   It  is  my  assessment  the  Muzinga  family  are
         prepared to work constructively with  this  service  and  therefore
         less likely to collude with any bhvr that could compromise the aims
         and  objectives  of  supervision.   ...he  has  a   realistic   and
         achievable release plan that we will support, and is aware  of  the
         action we will take should there be any breach of the conditions of
         statutory supervision on licence."

 7. The appellant produced at the hearing a recent probation  report  which
    he had not disclosed in advance, dated 4 April 2014.  In  that  letter,
    Mr Victor Donkin, his probation officer stated that he considered  that
    the reference to using heroin was an error since he could find  nothing
    in the case file to support it.   There was no reason to suppose that a
    risk of re-offending  was  of  concern.   Mr  Donkin  stated  that  the
    appellant had complied with his licence and supervision terms and that:

         "He has proved to be someone who has responded appropriately to the
         supervision process over a protracted period and I can state I have
         found him to be consistently polite and  courteous  in  my  contact
         with him.  Mr Muzinga has also demonstrated that he is someone with
         a positive work ethic and it is to his credit that he  has  striven
         hard to maintain himself in employment despite the difficulties  he
         has faced in terms of the restrictions placed on him  [he  wears  a
         tag which restricts and logs his movements].  He was most  recently
         employed with the  National  Deaf  Children's  Charity  as  a  fund
         raiser.  Unfortunately this employment was short lived  as  he  was
         advised he could not continue as his requirement to present himself
         each  week  for  immigration  purposes  precluded  him  from  being
         retained.  As a consequence  he  is  currently  engaging  with  our
         partnership  agency  with  regard  to   employment   and   training
         opportunities."

 8. That is the probation evidence before me.  There is no timeline  as  to
    the employment the appellant has managed to obtain, how  long  he  held
    the posts, or what training he has  undertaken  since  leaving  prison.
    Nor is there any mention of plumbing qualifications.  In addition,  the
    appellant produced a  letter  from  another  fundraising  organisation,
    Homefundraising Ltd, dated 23 April  2014,  recording  his  appointment
    with that organisation as a fund raiser for a  probationary  period  of
    three months.

Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006

 9. Regulation 21 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006, which so far as relevant, is as follows:

         "21.  (1)  In this regulation a "relevant decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

         (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period  of
         at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; ...

         (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public  policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-

         (a)    the   decision   must   comply   with   the   principle   of
         proportionality;

         (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct
         of the person concerned;

         (c)  the personal conduct of the person concerned must represent  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
         the fundamental interests of society;

         (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of  the  case  or  which
         relate to considerations of general prevention do not  justify  the
         decision;

         (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions do not in  themselves
         justify the decision.

         (6) Before taking a relevant decision  on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin."

The deportation decision

10. The respondent's deportation decision on 8 June  2012  was  made  under
    regulation 21(3) of the EEA Regulations 2006 (serious grounds of public
    policy or public  security).   She  now  accepts  that  the  applicable
    provision is regulation 21(4) (imperative grounds of  public  security)
    and on 7 February 2014 she gave supplementary reasons for her  decision
    under that provision.

11. After setting out the appellant's offending history, in her 7  February
    2014 letter the respondent noted that the appellant's elder brother and
    co-defendant, also a Portuguese national, had already been deported for
    the same offence.  The circumstances of the two  brothers  were  almost
    identical.  She considered that this appellant had entered the criminal
    world at a very serious and committed level and  continued  to  pose  a
    risk of reoffending:

         "18. Your client's personal conduct since the age of 15 is  one  of
         spiralling criminality...he began to use drugs at this age  -  both
         cannabis and heroin - and ended up in such a  severe  debt  to  his
         dealers  that  your  client  concluded  the  solution  was  'armed'
         robbery.  These facts  belie  the  statements  of  those  who  have
         testified to your client's previous good character.  Your client is
         still assessed as posing a medium risk  of  further  offending  and
         therefore it cannot be said that  his  personal  conduct  does  not
         still pose a risk to the fundamental aim of society to protect  its
         citizens from criminal violence. ...

         22.  ... Further it is noted that whilst your client pleaded guilty
         at the earliest opportunity there were other  participants  in  his
         'armed' robberies who he has, as  yet,  failed  to  identify.   The
         Secretary of State finds this fact of significant - and negative  -
         interest in measuring your client's  rehabilitation  and  potential
         for a positive r�le in United Kingdom society.

         Conclusion

         23.  Having given the extremely serious nature of the threat  posed
         by your client further consideration in the light of the imperative
         test under the  EEA  Regulations,  and  taking  into  account  your
         client's potential to become fully rehabilitated, the Secretary  of
         State is satisfied that any interference  in  your  client's  human
         rights is fully justified and  proportionate  in  accord  with  the
         imperative test and essential to the fundamental aim of  protecting
         the United Kingdom."

First-tier Tribunal determination

12. The First-tier Tribunal  heard  the  appeal  in  September  2012.   The
    Tribunal in its findings of fact noted  that  in  his  account  to  the
    probation officer, the appellant had stated that it was he who  invited
    his elder brother  to  help  him  commit  the  robberies;  his  brother
    obtained the handgun from a friend.  In his account to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, both in his witness statement  and  his  oral  evidence,  the
    appellant said it had been the brother's idea.    His parents, who both
    gave evidence, said  the  same.   The  Tribunal  considered  that  this
    inconsistency arose out of the desire of the appellant and his  parents
    to minimise his offending.

13. The family had heard that the brother, after being removed to Portugal,
    was now living in France.  The appellant  was  still  living  at  home:
    before his offences he had been on Jobseekers' Allowance and a  further
    benefit related to college attending.  The plumbing career which seemed
    so certain in June 2012 had not materialised, and was now described  as
    'just an idea'.  The appellant had taken an NVQ7 in rail track work but
    considered himself unable to work on the railways because he was  still
    tagged and could not work at night.  He had been offered a job  with  a
    Mr Ali, who had apparently employed him before his  offences,  but  had
    decided not to take it up  because  of  his  immigration  status.   The
    appellant stated that he knew he needed to keep busy, in order  not  to
    return to his previous lifestyle.

14. The appellant's parents still live in the United Kingdom.  However, the
    Tribunal found  that  he  had  an  uncle,  aunt,  and  grandparents  in
    Portugal, as well as his brother (when not  working  in  France).   The
    family had continued to have holidays in Portugal regularly  since  the
    appellant was five years old.  The Tribunal found that he would be able
    to reintegrate socially and linguistically  if  returned  to  Portugal.
    They found that the decision to deport the appellant was  proportionate
    in all the circumstances.

Error of law hearing

15. permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law in applying regulation  21(3):   that  is  no
    longer disputed.  On 12 February 2014, I set aside the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal on  that  basis  and  adjourned  the  appeal  to  a
    substantive hearing.   The  appellant's  mother  was  present  at  that
    hearing but there was no new witness statement from her and she did not
    give evidence at either of the hearings before me.  The appellant  gave
    brief evidence in relation to his bail,  to  the  effect  that  he  was
    unable to pursue a  post  he  had  obtained,  because  of  the  tagging
    provisions, which he had not disclosed when applying for the  job.    I
    refused  to  vary  the  terms  of  his  bail  after  hearing  from  the
    respondent.

16. I did not proceed to remake the decision at  the  12  February  hearing
    because the respondent served the supplementary letter dated 7 February
    2014 at the hearing, and the appellant was plainly disadvantaged by not
    having had an  opportunity  to  seek  legal  advice  and  file  further
    evidence in response, if he chose to do so.  I therefore adjourned  the
    substantive hearing to the first open day after four weeks and directed
    both parties to file and serve any  further  documents  on  which  they
    intended to rely, including witness statements, not  later  than  seven
    days before the resumed hearing.

Remaking the determination

17.  The question for the Upper Tribunal at the substantive hearing  on  30
    April 2014 was whether the First-tier Tribunal's error was material  to
    the outcome of the appeal, that  is,  whether  the  difference  between
    'serious grounds of public policy' and 'imperative  grounds  of  public
    policy' on the facts of  this  appeal  was  sufficient  to  lead  to  a
    different outcome for the appeal.   The appellant  appeared  in  person
    again.  No new material was served before the  hearing:  the  appellant
    did not obtain legal representation in the period of approximately  ten
    weeks before the resumed hearing. No member of his  family  accompanied
    him.

18. In his evidence at the hearing, the  appellant  accepted  that  he  had
    committed a serious crime.  However, he had done so as a  young  person
    of 18 and was now a different person.  He was  seeking  an  opportunity
    for normal life, recognising that his behaviour  had  hurt  people  and
    changed the lives of others, maybe forever.  Nobody could say now  that
    he was not a changed man.  A  few  days  before  the  hearing,  he  had
    obtained employment representing St Mungo's Homeless Charity.

19. Mr Tarlow asked the appellant whether  he  had  studied  further  since
    leaving prison.  The appellant said that the job centres were very busy
    and although he had done one or two free work programmes,  he  had  not
    really gone to the job centre very much. They had other people to think
    about, thousands of them.  He had been registered for about  18  months
    now.  The free courses he had taken, one in 2012 and one in  2013  were
    not at his level:  he could get proof of attendance but  those  courses
    were for less intelligent people and were unlikely to rehabilitate him.
     He was occupied and 'very workaholic'.  He wanted to change his life.

20. When I asked the appellant why there were no letters  from  his  family
    and no one had accompanied him to the hearing, the  appellant  said  he
    was ashamed to bring them to every court hearing;  the problem was his,
    not that of his family.   When asked whether  he  was  aware  that  the
    present hearing might be the last one, the hearing which sent him  home
    to Portugal, the appellant said that he did  know  that,  but  had  not
    really been thinking about it in those terms.

21. In submissions for the respondent, Mr Tarlow relied on her  letters  of
    refusal and in particular the February 2014  letter  dealing  with  the
    'imperative grounds' test. He  reminded  me  that  the  appellant,  his
    brother and a number of other youths whose identities the appellant had
    declined to disclose had gone on a robbery spree, hitting at least nine
    bookmakers' shops and stealing approximately �17000 over a period of  a
    month.  The imitation firearm wielded by the  appellant  had  terrified
    staff in the shops.  Evidence of rehabilitation  after  leaving  prison
    was very slight indeed:  the appellant had not established any  settled
    employment and was a single man who could properly and  proportionately
    be returned to Portugal.  The respondent's decision was correct in law.

22. The appellant in his submissions  asserted  that  he  had  indeed  been
    rehabilitated.   He  relied  on  his  latest  employment  letter,   the
    probation  letter,  and  the  courses  he  had  studied  in  the  Young
    Offenders' Institution, which had included drug awareness,  advice  and
    guidance, and P-ASRO.  He was unable to tell me what P-ASRO stood  for:
    an internet search suggests that it  stands  for  Prison  -  Addressing
    Substance Related Offending.   He  remained  on  licence  and  had  not
    committed any further offences.  There had been no change in  his  bail
    conditions.  He asserted that he was no longer a risk to society.

Discussion

23. The narrow point for  me  is  whether,  applying  the  higher  test  of
    'imperative grounds', the respondent's decision to remove the appellant
    to Portugal is lawful.  I am satisfied that  it  is.   The  appellant's
    offences were very serious and he was the  one  with  the  gun  (albeit
    apparently a replica).  Although he pursued education in prison,  since
    leaving he has had only sporadic employment, mostly  when  there  is  a
    hearing pending.  He produces no evidence  of  family  support  in  the
    United Kingdom. He does not disclose that he is  tagged  when  applying
    for posts, suggesting that he is not doing  so  through  his  probation
    officer.  He applies for posts the conditions of which require  him  to
    breach his tagging conditions and then does not pursue  them  for  that
    reason.  He has not stuck at anything for any length of time.

24. The respondent has applied her mind to the requirements  of  paragraphs
    21(5) and 21(6) of the Regulations and the conclusions she reached were
    open to her on the facts of this case. There is  nothing  in  the  very
    limited evidence before me to suggest that the appellant is  not  still
    at least a  medium  risk  of  re-offending,  should  his  circumstances
    change.  He is intelligent enough to make sure that while he is  tagged
    and on licence no further offences are committed but absent any settled
    life in the United Kingdom that is not sufficient reassurance  for  the
    future.  The appellant has  family  both  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    Portugal, which he has visited regularly since  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom.   The respondent did not err in considering that he  could  be
    reintegrated  easily  there  and  that  his  removal   would   not   be
    disproportionate.

25. I remake the decision by dismissing the appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Rules, the EEA Regulations, and on human rights grounds.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set  aside  the  decision.  I  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
dismissing it.
