Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant is a citizen of Mauritius, whose date of birth is recorded as
19th January 1980.  He made application for indefinite leave to remain in
the United Kingdom based upon long residency.  His case was that he had
been in the United Kingdom lawfully for ten years.  A decision was made by
the Secretary of State to refuse the application.  The Appellant appealed
and his appeal was heard on 20th February 2018 by Judge of the First-tier
Tribunal Buckwell, sitting at Taylor House.  He dismissed the appeal.

It is not necessary for me to say very much in this case for the reasons
that follow but, not content with the decision, by Notice dated 6th April
2018 the Appellant sought application for permission to appeal to the Upper
Tribunal.  That was initially refused but a renewed application resulted in
permission being granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Martin on 12th November
2018. Thus the matter comes before me.

Quite properly, Mr Walker concedes the appeal.  I agree entirely.  The case
turned on whether there was continuing 3C leave.  There was and that is not
in dispute.

In the circumstances, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside
and remade such that the appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is to the Upper Tribunal is allowed. The decision of  the  First-
tier Tribunal is set aside and remade such that the  appeal  in  the  First-
tier Tribunal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
