For the Appellant:     Mr M Templeton, of Quinn, Martin & Langan,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Green, promulgated on 9 February 2017, dismissing  his  appeal  against
    refusal of recognition as a refugee from Iran.

 2. The first ground of appeal is on these lines. The judge failed to  make
    adequate findings on central elements of the  claim.  The  judge  noted
    inconsistency over when the appellant became a member or  supporter  of
    the KDP. It is accepted that confusion arose, and that no challenge can
    be taken against the drawing of an adverse credibility finding on  this
    aspect. The judge found  confusion  over  when  the  appellant  started
    smuggling goods for the party.  On that, there was no  confusion.   The
    appellant's evidence, written and oral, was emphatic  that  he  started
    smuggling goods on 2 April 2015. The judge said  that  as  he  did  not
    accept that the appellant had been engaged in smuggling activities  for
    the party as he claimed, his further claims about a raid on  his  house
    and his rationale for fleeing Iran could not be  sustained.  The  judge
    erred by dismissing the entirety  of  the  account  based  on  the  one
    adverse finding that the appellant was (not) a member of the  KDP.   It
    was not permissible to disbelieve one aspect and use that  as  a  basis
    for the credibility of the whole.

 3. The second ground maintains as  follows.   The  inadequate  credibility
    findings are  significantly  compounded  by  reference  throughout  the
    judgement to "an entirely different political party, the  KDPI  ...  an
    extremely worrying error". The respondent's refusal letter was based on
    the appellant's purported membership of the KDPI, an entirely different
    political party from the KDP. A previous  hearing  had  been  adjourned
    owing in part to this error and with a view to revisal of  the  refusal
    letter. The refusal letter had not  been  revised,  but  the  erroneous
    reference had been acknowledged. Despite that  earlier  procedure,  the
    judge wrote "an entire judgement premised on the appellant's case being
    about membership of the KDPI.  This ... must be regarded as creating  a
    sense of real injustice... that the judge has simply  not  applied  the
    proper anxious scrutiny".

 4. The third ground relates to the appellant not producing at interview on
    21 January 2016 a letter from the KDP which  he  obtained  in  February
    2016, and it being held against him that he  provided  no  satisfactory
    explanation for not producing this earlier. The appellant had  said  in
    an  early  statement  that  he  hoped  to  be  able  to  send   further
    documentation from his paternal aunt's husband. He explained in  cross-
    examination how he obtained it, just over 3 months from his arrival  in
    the UK, "not of itself a lengthy period but in particular not a lengthy
    period when obtaining it required the appellant to correspond with  his
    uncle in Iraq... it is simply perverse for the judge to  conclude  that
    the letter ought to have been obtained earlier".  The  matter  of  late
    receipt had not been raised either by the respondent or  by  the  judge
    with the appellant.  It was a further error to hold  that  against  the
    appellant, when he had not been asked for an explanation.

 5. Mr Templeton submitted further along  the  lines  of  the  grounds,  as
    follows. Once the error of fact identified at  ground  1  was  excised,
    there was insufficient reasoning left.  The appellant had  been  cross-
    examined on when he began to support the party or became a member,  but
    not on when he started smuggling, on which there was no  inconsistency.
    This was not a case where inconsistency on one aspect  could  undermine
    the whole.  It was unsatisfactory to refer to the party  by  the  wrong
    initials, when the correct identification had been a major issue.  That
    was bound to leave a sense of  injustice.   There  was  no  significant
    delay in producing the letter.  The case should be remitted  for  fresh
    hearing.

 6. Mr Matthews made  close  refence  to  the  evidence  at  interview  (in
    particular Q/A 38, 57, and 58); the paragraphs in the  refusal  letter,
    putting the appellant on notice of the credibility issues (�36 - 46, in
    particular �39); and the oral evidence, as recorded in the decision,  7
    (iv), which he said demonstrated multiple inconsistencies, and no error
    in  the  conclusion  that  the  appellant  gave  confusing  and   self-
    contradictory evidence not only about  one  point,  but  on  the  whole
    matter  of  supporting  or  joining  the  party,  and  when,  including
    smuggling.  He submitted further that there was such a strong basis  in
    those matters for the adverse decision that separate  discussion  about
    the alleged raid and the appellant's flight was not required.  Ground 2
    was at worst an unfortunate slip.  The background materials produced by
    the appellant showed that the two  parties  arose  from  a  split,  has
    similar emblems, and described themselves in very similar  terms  which
    could give rise to either set of initials in English. If  there  was  a
    misconception, nothing turned on it.  There was no error  in  what  the
    Judge said about late production of the letter from the party, but that
    was a minor point and not the reason for giving it little  weight.   It
    was found to be of no real worth, based on its own terms, at 14  (iii),
    a finding not criticised by the appellant.

 7. I reserved my decision.

 8. The extent to which adverse findings extend  to  the  rest  of  a  case
    varies with the circumstances.   There  is  no  general  obligation  to
    provide separate reasoning on each specific  allegation.    Mr  Mathews
    was able to  demonstrate  the  strength  of  the  adverse  findings  by
    reference to the  underlying  evidence.   The  evidence  was  poor,  on
    aspects which, once disbelieved, necessarily fed into the rest  of  the
    case.  Ground 1 resolves on examination into no more than  disagreement
    with factual findings which were open to the Judge and for which he has
    given legally adequate reasons.

 9. One party heads its notepaper as, "Kurdistan Democratic Party,  (KDP  -
    Iran)"; the other as, "Kurdistan Democratic Party,  (PDK  -  I)".   The
    assignation of the initials in English  "KDP"  and  "KDPI"  might  well
    apply to either.  A case might arise which turned on  the  distinction,
    but this is not it.  Even if the description in the decision is in some
    sense "wrong", that had nothing to do with the outcome.

10. It was well within reason for the Judge at �13 and 14 (ii) to take  the
    late production of the letter as an adverse point, by reference to  the
    obligation to make prompt and full disclosure under immigration  rules,
    �339L.  As Mr Matthews pointed out, the  letter  was  found  for  other
    reasons to have "very limited evidential value" at  14  (iii),  and  no
    criticism was or could be made of that.

11. As to the development  of  this  ground  into  a  point  of  procedural
    fairness, the record in the decision shows that the chronology was  put
    to the appellant, that he said all he has to say  on  the  matter,  and
    that he has nothing to add.  The evidence was there for  the  Judge  to
    resolve.  Neither procedural nor substantive unfairness is discernible.


12. The grounds and submissions for the appellant do not  demonstrate  that
    the making of the tribunal's decision involved the making of any  error
    on a point of law, such that  it  ought  to  be  set  aside.   The  one
    possible error is use of the wrong initials for the party, but that  is
    less than clearly established, and even if so, it is beside the point.

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

14. An anonymity direction was made in the FtT.  It is not  said  why  that
    may have been appropriate, but as the matter was not addressed  in  the
    UT, this decision had been anonymised.
