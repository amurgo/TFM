               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Lewis, instructed by Londonium Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision of the Secretary of State made
    on 11 October 2018 to refuse him leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
    on  human  rights  grounds.   His  appeal  against  that  decision  was
    dismissed in a decision  promulgated  on  8  November  2019.   For  the
    reasons set out in my decision of 9 November 2020,  that  decision  was
    set aside (a copy is attached).

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 20 January 2010 with  entry
    clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Student valid until 18 July  2011.   He
    was granted further periods of leave to remain as a student.   Although
    he had leave to remain until 20 March 2015, he was subsequently accused
    of working without permission.   He  appealed  against  that  decision,
    successfully, but the respondent  did  not  grant  him  further  leave,
    subsequently in February 2015, alleging that he had employed  deception
    in obtaining a TOEIC English test result.

 3. The respondent's case is set out initially in the letter of 11  October
    2018 and is that, essentially, the appellant  had  used  a  proxy  test
    taker and thus he had obtained his TOEIC certificate by deception.

 4. The thrust of the appellant's argument is that, notwithstanding SM  and
    Qadir [2016] UKUT 00229 the generic evidence concerned with TOEIC fraud
    is now no longer reliable as it is now clear that a  number  of  people
    identified by the test providers as having  cheated  did  not  in  fact
    cheat and as ETS  are  not  able  to  tie  an  individual  test  to  an
    individual test taker, there being no "chain of custody"  metadata  and
    that thus the only way of tying a test to an individual  is  to  assume
    the bona fides (or otherwise) of the testing college.

 5. The appellant has now obtained a recording from  ETS  of  the  relevant
    voice tests. He accepts that  the  recording  is  not  of  him  but  he
    submits, relying on the expert evidence in Saha v SSHD [2017] UKUT  17,
    that there was a distinct possibility that ETS computer  records  could
    not be relied upon because of serious problems in how the data and  the
    voice recordings are managed by the relevant college after the test and
    their transmission to ETS, and in how ETS manages the relevant data.

 6. The appellant also sought to  rely  on  the  report  of  the  APPG  but
    accepts, following DK and RK (Parliamentary privilege; evidence)  India
    [2021] UKUT 61, that the opinions of the APPG are  not  admissible.  He
    appellant submits however that  the  evidence  contained  in  those  is
    admissible.

 7. The appellant puts forward a number of reasons why in light of the  new
    evidence, there are a number of reasons why fraudulent methods may have
    been used by various colleges leading to the conclusion  that  the  ETS
    lists were not a reliable indicator of whether or  not  a  student  had
    cheated.

 8. Three principal points are made:

      1) there is a number of possible innocent explanations as to  why  the
         voice recording might be somebody else: it could be a simple mix-up
         by admin staff because even though safeguards required by ETS  were
         being observed, there could have been at the relevant college, more
         technically sophisticated fraud such  as  remote  access  and  file
         substitution;

      2) there was no evidence linking  the  voice  recording  back  to  any
         individual,  the  chain  of  custody  not  being  established,   no
         identifying number or other matter linking the test  to  the  taker
         and thus a link could only be established when assuming the college
         staff had done things properly, a problem if it  were  the  college
         staff who were the main fraudsters;

      3) relying on the National Audit Office's report,  the  identification
         of a test as invalid  or  questionable  by  ETS  is  not  a  viable
         indicator of whether in fact a student  cheated;  and,  the  figure
         that 97% of all results in the UK being identified  as  invalid  or
         questionable was clearly implausible.

The Hearing

 9. There were significant problems in connecting to the video link and  it
    was not possible to start the hearing until 11.20.   At  that  point  a
    further delay was required as  the  respondent  had  not  received  all
    relevant documents.

10. I heard evidence from the appellant who adopted his witness  statements
    and  was  cross-examined.   I  then   heard   submissions   from   both
    representatives.

The Law

11. The appeal in this case is against a decision to refuse  the  appellant
    leave to remain on human rights grounds.   It  is  agreed  between  the
    parties that the sole issue before me is whether or not  the  appellant
    used fraud in obtaining a TOEIC certificate.  If that is decided in his
    favour then it will be for the  respondent  to  decide  what  leave  to
    grant.

12. In assessing whether the appellant has, as the respondent alleges, used
    deception both parties are agreed that there is a three part test to be
    addressed:

      a) the Secretary of State must produce sufficient evidence to raise an
         issue as to the existence or  non-existence  of  a  fact  in  issue
         indicating prima facie deception;

      b) it is then for the appellant  to  raise  an  innocent  explanation,
         namely  an  account  which   satisfies   the   minimum   level   of
         plausibility; if that is produced then

      c) the burden rests on the Secretary of  State  to  establish  on  the
         balance  of  probabilities  that  the   appellant's   prima   facie
         explanation is to be rejected.

Submissions

13. The first dispute between the parties is to whether  the  Secretary  of
    State has met the initial evidential burden.  The appellant  says  that
    it has not but equally, in submissions, Mr Whitwell accepted  that  the
    appellant had met the second part of the test,  thus  it  was  for  the
    Secretary of State to establish that the innocent explanation was to be
    rejected.

14. Mr Whitwell submitted that the evidence including the ETS look-up  tool
    was sufficient to discharge the prima facie burden  and  that  although
    the  appellant's  explanation,  that  he  had  no  need  to  cheat,  is
    plausible, the respondent had nonetheless established  that  dishonesty
    had been used.  He submitted that there was inconsistent evidence as to
    whether the appellant had anything to  gain,  given  that  it  was  not
    consistent that family issues in isolation  were  the  sole  causes  of
    distress, GP records certainly regarding stress in 2012 around the time
    of the test in which he had said  that  he  was  under  pressure  about
    studies, money and visa was different from family issues but  indicated
    that there was a reason for using a proxy test.  He submitted that  the
    appellant's current level of English was not relevant  given  how  long
    ago the test had been conducted and that although the appellant was  an
    able student, his results were not "stellar", his GCSE results being Cs
    and Ds, again Ds in his studies  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  he  had
    received a 2:2 honours degree.

15. Turning to Project Faï¿½ade Mr Whitwell asked me  to  note  that  of  118
    tests that day all had been called into  question,  47  of  them  being
    questionable and the remaining ones being invalid.  He  submitted  that
    the evidence of what had gone on there did not  bear  close  comparison
    with what the appellant had said in his  witness  statement  of  people
    sitting at computer  terminals.   He  submitted  further  that  it  was
    instructive the appellant could not recall what  had  happened  in  the
    IELTS test but could recall what had happened in the TOEIC test.

16. Mr Whitwell submitted further that the appellant had lied about working
    in a hardware shop and having used  cannabis  recreationally  and  that
    these responses went to the reliability of his statement that he  would
    not cheat as it was wrong.  Mr Whitwell  asked  me  to  note  also  the
    witnesses who had given testimony on the earlier occasion did not  deal
    with the issue of cheating head-on yet they did not say why it was  not
    wrong.

17. Mr Whitwell submitted that little  weight  could  be  attached  to  the
    report of Georgia Da Costa indicative that there was suicidal  ideation
    on the part of the appellant contrary to what was said at paragraph 110
    of the bundle.

18. Mr Lewis submitted that the explanation provided by the  appellant  was
    plausible and it  is  of  note  that  he  had  taken  a  degree  at  an
    established university which had been done in English.  There  is  also
    evidence from his tutors who  confirmed  his  English  was  of  a  high
    standard and that in order to succeed he required an  IELTS  equivalent
    of 5.5 which is lower than what he had got before.  He  submitted  that
    the appellant was  confident  and  he  had  done  mock  tests  and  had
    described what he did and that there was no  challenge  to  whether  he
    took the test, noting that Operation Faï¿½ade was done at Colwell College
    in Leicester but the appellant had attended in the Whitechapel  branch.



19. Mr Lewis submitted that credit should be given  to  the  appellant  who
    when interviewed without notice, was able to explain what was  required
    in the test, the procedures of what he had undertaken,  that  this  had
    not been challenged and was entirely consistent.  He submitted that the
    appellant had no reason to cheat, was not of significant means so there
    was no reason to pay someone and that the appeal ought to be allowed.

Discussion

20. The question in this case is, in reality, can the appellant account for
    why, as he accepts, the extracts from the voice recordings provided  by
    ETS as evidence of what was said during the test are clearly not him.

21. While I have some sympathy for Mr  Lewis'  submissions  there  are  now
    additional doubts regarding the prima facie evidence in  generic  terms
    about the reliability of material such as to  generate  a  prima  facie
    case for the Home Office, given the matters  identified  by  the  joint
    expert report that as in this case  by  the  fact  that  the  appellant
    admits that it is not his voice on the recordings.  I  am  not  in  the
    circumstances satisfied that the Secretary of State has not established
    a prima facie case on all the evidence that the appellant had not  been
    dishonest.

22. The next stage is to consider whether the appellant's explanation, that
    he had taken the test, and that there are defects in the  software  and
    means of recording the voice  responses  to  questions  such  that  the
    Secretary of State has failed to show on the balance  of  probabilities
    that the appellant had cheated.

23. Having  considered  carefully  the  appellant's  evidence  set  out  in
    paragraphs 5 to 12 of  his  witness  statement,  I  consider  that  the
    appellant has given significant detail about the test that he  attended
    at Colwell College.  It is evident from his evidence that this was  the
    branch in Whitechapel and there is, as Mr Lewis submitted, a copy of  a
    receipt from a nearby Sports Direct shop on  the  same  date.   I  have
    considered also the report entitled "Project Faï¿½ade" but  the  material
    in that relates to Colwell College,  Leicester,  not  Colwell  College,
    Whitechapel. The report does not make  it  clear  if  it  includes  the
    latter, and it appears it does not. It is thus  is  of  limited  or  no
    assistance in assessing the circumstances applicable at the Whitechapel
    branch.

24. There are, as Mr Whitwell submitted, a number of issues regarding  what
    is recorded in the appellant's medical notes obtained from the  GP  and
    his evidence before me.  He said, in examination-in-chief, that he  had
    not had additional support to take exams in the  past,  had  never  had
    reason to go to a doctor with  problems  about  taking  exams  and  was
    confident on this occasion that he could pass.   In  cross-examination,
    he confirmed that he did not  have  a  history  of  depressive  illness
    before coming to the United Kingdom and that what had triggered it  was
    mostly family related, his parents were ill, he was away from them,  he
    was isolated from them.  He did not accept that his  difficulties  with
    his studies in the United Kingdom were an underlying cause and  it  was
    nothing to do with his education.

25. It is evident from a letter of 7 March 2013  from  Homerton  University
    Hospital that the appellant was seen in  the  Primary  Care  Psychology
    Service on 25 February 2013 for managing anxiety and low mood  and  had
    scored  highly  on  severe  depression  and  anxiety  indicators.   The
    appellant was registered with the practice on 6 March 2012  and  it  is
    not in dispute that he has been prescribed Citalopram in the  past  but
    the list of "minor past events" first records stress  related  problems
    on 23 January 2013. The appellant sat his test in June 2012  but  there
    is no record for stress related problems until 23  January  2013.   The
    notes are relatively brief and record that he had been  worrying  about
    his studies, money, visa, student and business management and  that  he
    was "under a lot of stress, too much pressure, mind  wandering  a  lot,
    poor concentration, forgetfulness started one  year,  now  one  getting
    worse".  The notes are, however, brief as are the notes of 20  February
    2103, 4 September 2013 in which it is  recorded  that  he  had  stopped
    using antidepressants in February 2013.

26. On 29 August 2014 the problem identified is that

         "The appellant is forgetful, is  concerned  he  cannot  retain  new
         information, is studying for a Masters degree, this seems worse  in
         the past couple of years and feels worse than his peers, he is also
         suffering with low mood, does feel affected by this, is unsure that
         psychology is helping".

27. I bear in mind that the doctor's notes ought not to be  treated  as  an
    accurate verbatim report of what he had said  and  phrases  like  "past
    couple of years" are in their nature imprecise.   It  is  difficult  to
    attach much weight to the phrase "forgetfulness started one year"  from
    23 January 2013 as being evidence  of  problems  existing  exactly  one
    year, ago and I bear in mind that at this point the appellant refers to
    stress and anxiety rather than depression.  I do,  however,  note  that
    the appellant had been to see the doctor about  stress  and  whilst  he
    mentioned in evidence that it was related to his family,  this  is  not
    mentioned to the doctor.  This is, I consider, an omission rather  than
    any inconsistency but it does require some explanation.  I  can  accept
    that the appellant might not recall what he told the doctor, as he said
    in cross-examination, I draw no inferences  adverse  to  him  from  him
    being unable  to  recall  precisely  what  he  said.   It  is  entirely
    different being asked to recall nine years after  the  event  what  one
    told the doctor as opposed to  the  events  around  a  test  which  the
    appellant has had to recall in detail because of  the  importance  that
    they have taken in his life.   There  is  no  real  comparison  between
    these.  It could be that the doctor wrote down only some stressors;  it
    could be that any discussion focussed on these rather than  others;  it
    could be that the  appellant  did  not  mention  family.  But  at  this
    distance in time,  I  do  not  consider  that  I  can  safely  reach  a
    conclusion as to why worries about family were omitted from the notes.

28. The appellant is recorded in the doctor's notes on 1 May 2019 as  using
    cannabis as he thought it would help with sleep.  Yet when it  was  put
    to him he simply denied it saying that he had never  taken  drugs.   He
    also denied saying that he had worked in a hardware store, contrary  to
    the doctor's notes at 12 October 2016.

29. The appellant has not provided any good reason for why the doctor would
    have recorded that he had tried cannabis to help him sleep  and  worked
    in a hardware store and I am satisfied that he has not told the  truth.
    I  am  satisfied  that  he  did  use  cannabis  and  has  been  working
    unlawfully.

30. But equally, I bear  in  mind  that  people  tell  lies  for  different
    reasons.  In both  cases  the  appellant  was  being  asked  in  cross-
    examination to admit to what he could easily have perceived as criminal
    offences - that is, working illegally  and  having  possessed  class  B
    drugs.

31. I consider it appropriate to direct myself that sometimes people do not
    tell the truth and in fact lie, for  many  reasons:  see  MA  (Somalia)
    [2010] UKSC 49 at [32] to [33], per Dyson SCJ.

32. Nonetheless it is a point I must consider in assessing the  appellant's
    protestation that he would not have cheated.

33. I draw no inferences adverse to the appellant  from  his  inability  to
    recall in detail the IELTS test or from the witness  statement  of  the
    uncle and friends who do not address the  issue  of  cheating  head-on.
    Further, they were not present to be examined and cross-examined.

34. As regards IELTS, I can accept that the appellant would not  know  when
    he had sat the test given that he has had no reason to have  to  recall
    that until long after the event. That is in contrast with him having to
    recall what happened in respect of the  TOEIC  test  which  has  become
    central to his case.

35. In the appellant's favour I do accept that his  academic  achievements,
    although not stellar, are good.  He obtained a 2:2  honours  degree  in
    the United Kingdom which is in itself indicative of a  relatively  high
    command of English.  With regard to the IELTS test level, which was 5.5
    a year before the TOEIC test, it is of note that his score for speaking
    was 6.5.  The tests are, I accept, different and  that  IELTS  is  more
    difficult. The Common European Framework of Reference indicates that an
    IELTS speaking test score of 6.5 is borderline B2/C1 (C1 being  higher)
    and the 2012 TOEIC speaking test score of 200 was equivalent  to  a  C1
    CEFR.  But, given that the score that  the  voice  recordings  did  not
    match up, little weight can be attached to that.  But  having  achieved
    one year before the ETS test a speaking score of 6.5, and,  given  that
    living and studying in the United Kingdom that  was  unlikely  to  have
    deteriorated, it is indicative that he  would  not  have  had  to  have
    recourse to a proxy test taker for the spoken element of the test.

36.  In  addition  to  the  above,  I  note  that  there  are   significant
    difficulties with the chain of custody.  Without  taking  into  account
    the evidence considered by the APPG or the National Audit Office, it is
    sufficiently clear that there are a number of ways  in  which  evidence
    may well have become muddled particularly given the lack of rigour,  if
    not outright dishonesty, which appears  to  have  occurred  at  various
    colleges. That much is clear from the conclusions of the experts as set
    out in MA (ETS - TOEIC testing) at [15] and in Saha v SSHD [2017]  UKUT
    17 (IAC)

37. With regard to the National Audit Office evidence, it is  difficult  to
    attach much weight to that.  It  is  in  the  form  of  conclusions  it
    reached on the basis of evidence  and  in  particular  statistics  made
    available to it. It does not, in my view, add much of substance to  the
    evidence of the experts already referred to.  And, even at its highest,
    it only supports the premise that what ETS has said is not reliable; it
    does not say that there were no candidates  cheating,  only  that  some
    innocents were wrongly classified as  having  done  so.   It  does  not
    assist in determining whether this appellant has been truthful  or  not
    as, ultimately, that depends on my assessment of his evidence.

38. I turn finally to the report from Ms Georgia  Costa.   Her  credentials
    are unclear as indeed are the basis on which  she  concluded  that  the
    appellant was showing suicidal ideation.  There  is  no  indication  of
    that in the extensive medical notes from the GP and I attach no  weight
    to it.

39. Drawing these strands  and  factors  together,  I  accept  that  it  is
    possible that the appellant did take the test but that, given the  lack
    of transparency as to how recordings processed by the college  and  any
    metadata linking it to a  specific  candidate  and  test  session  were
    recorded or processed, that another test was linked to him,  hence  the
    recording supplied to him is not of him.

40. Has the respondent shown that  explanation  cannot  be  sustained?  The
    appellant has provided detailed evidence of him  taking  the  test  and
    what it involved. There is also circumstantial evidence of him being in
    the area on the day in question. He was  also,  when  interviewed  with
    little notice of him being able to recall detail.  There  is  also  the
    unchallenged testimony of  his  tutors  George  Clearly  [AB  ï¿½83]  and
    Professor Bruce Cronin from the University of Greenwich who attested to
    his high level of understanding and ability to 'express and present his
    ideas to professional standards'.

41. The appellant has no criminal convictions, and the  occasional  use  of
    cannabis and  working  unlawfully,  perhaps  understandable  given  his
    financial circumstance, does not diminish his  good  character  to  any
    great extent. But his lack of  candour  when  cross-examined  on  these
    points does cause me concern as it may indicate  a  propensity  to  lie
    when confronted with evidence of having committed an offence.

42. There is, however, a difference between a straightforward and, frankly,
    clumsy denial and the confection of an account of taking  a  test  with
    all the detail provided, with consistency, and being tested about  that
    when  questioned.  That  would  indicate  a   significant   degree   of
    sophisticated and deliberation.  The appellant's denials are,  however,
    indicative of someone not used to deceiving and while they  do  not  do
    him credit, I do not find that they undermine his other evidence.

43. Taking all of these factors into  account,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    appellant has told the truth  about  sitting  the  test  and  that  the
    respondent has not shown, on the balance  of  probabilities,  that  the
    appellant has exercised deception.

44. For these reasons, I allow the appeal.

Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal on Human Rights grounds.

                        (noANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)
                                                                   Appellant


                                     and



               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

45. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Siddall promulgated on 8 November 2019,  dismissing
    his appeal under the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    against a decision of the respondent made on 21 March  2019  to  refuse
    his human rights claim.

46. The core reason for the refusal of the claim,  in  this  case,  is  the
    respondent's finding that the appellant did not  meet  the  suitability
    requirements under S-LTR of Appendix FM as  he  had  obtained  a  TOEIC
    certificate from ETS by deception, that  is,  by  using  a  proxy  test
    taker.

47. Given that the respondent accepts that the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal involved the making of an error of law as  claimed,  and  does
    not assert that any of the findings can be preserved there is  no  need
    to set out here the facts of the appeal in detail.  It is sufficient to
    state the judge found that  the  responded  had,  through  the  generic
    evidence and look-up tool found that the respondent had discharged  the
    burden of proof in establishing deception.

48. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds,  inter  alia,
    that the judge had erred in his evaluation of the generic evidence,  in
    particular failing to  have  regard  to  submissions  made  as  to  the
    reliability of that evidence as set out in the skeleton argument.

49. On 3 June 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman granted permission on all
    grounds and gave directions which  provided amongst other matters:

     1. I have reviewed the file in this case.  In the light of the  present
        need to take precautions against the spread  of  Covid-19,  and  the
        overriding objective expressed in the  Procedure  Rules[1],  I  have
        reached the provisional  view,   that  it  would  in  this  case  be
        appropriate to determine the following questions without a hearing:

        a)  whether  the  making  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
           involved the making of an error of law, and, if so

        b) whether that decision should be set aside.

     2. I therefore make the following DIRECTIONS:

         i) The appellant may submit further submissions in support of  the
            assertion of an error of law, and on the question  whether  the
            First-tier Tribunal's decision should be set aside if error  of
            law is found, to be filed and served on all  other  parties  no
            later than 14 days after this notice is sent out (the  date  of
            sending is on the covering letter or covering email);

        ii) Any other party may file and serve submissions in response,  no
            later than 21 days after this notice is sent out;

       iii) If submissions are made in accordance with paragraph (ii) above
            the party who sought permission to appeal may file and serve  a
            reply no later than 28 days after this notice is sent out.

        iv) All submissions  that  rely  on  any  document  not  previously
            provided to all  other  parties  in  electronic  form  must  be
            accompanied by electronic copies of any such document.

     3. Any party who considers that  despite  the  foregoing  directions  a
        hearing is necessary to consider the questions set out in  paragraph
        1 (or either of them) above must submit reasons  for  that  view  no
        later than 21 days after this notice is sent out and  they  will  be
        taken into account by the Tribunal.  The directions in  paragraph  2
        above must be complied with in every case.


50. Both parties made submissions in response to directions, the respondent
    on 13 August 2020 stating that she did not oppose the  application  for
    permission, and inviting the Upper Tribunal to set aside  the  decision
    and remit it to the First-tier Tribunal.

51. In a more detailed skeleton argument served  on  18  August  2020,  the
    appellant draws attention to the summary of the joint  expert  evidence
    in MA (ETS-TOEIC testing) Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450 which drew  attention
    to the absence of a chain of custody or audit trail that would  link  a
    particular voice recording to a  particular  candidate  and  additional
    evidence on this issue put before the APPG  (see  skeleton  at  [6]  to
    [9]).

52. The Tribunal has the power to make the decision without a hearing under
    Rule 34 of the Procedure Rules.  Rule 34(2) requires me to have  regard
    to the views of the parties.  Bearing in mind the overriding  objective
    in Rule 2 to enable the Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and  justly,
    and bearing in mind the concession by the respondent,  I  am  satisfied
    that in the particular circumstances of this  case  that  it  would  be
    correct to make a decision being made in the absence of a hearing.

53. I am satisfied that the judge did err in reaching his  decision  as  is
    claimed in the grounds of appeal and as is accepted by the  respondent.
    The decision clearly involved the making of an error of law as  claimed
    as these errors went to the core of the case.

54. I am not, however, persuaded that it would be appropriate to remit this
    case to the First-tier Tribunal.   The Upper Tribunal is able  to  make
    the relevant factual findings and the issues raised in  ground  1  may,
    potentially, have much wider impact than in this one appeal and may  be
    a matter on which the Upper Tribunal may wish to give guidance.



Notice of Decision & Directions

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error of law and I set it aside.

 2. The appeal will be heard in the Upper Tribunal on a date to be fixed.

 3. Having regard to the Pilot Practice Direction and  the  UTIAC  Guidance
    Note No 1 of 2020, the Upper Tribunal is provisionally of the view that
    there should be a Case Management Review ("CMR") in this  appeal  which
    can and should be held remotely, by Skype for Business on a date to  be
    fixed within the period 15 November 2020 to 15 January 2021.

 4. No later than 7 days after these  directions  are  sent  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal:

      (a) the parties shall file and serve by email  any  objection  to  the
      hearing being a remote CMR hat all/by the proposed  means;  in  either
      case giving reasons; and

      (b) without prejudice to the  Tribunal's  consideration  of  any  such
      objections, the parties shall also file and serve:

           (i) contact/join-in details, were the hearing is to  take  place
           remotely by the means currently proposed; and
           (ii) in that event, dates to avoid in the period specified.



 5. The Tribunal will at the CMR then give further  directions  as  to  how
    this matter is to proceed.
