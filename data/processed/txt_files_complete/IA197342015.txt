Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr N Jeganathan, Solicitor of Acculaegal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS



1. By my decision promulgated on 29 August 2017. I found that the decision
   of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law and set it aside. I
   now remake the decision.


2. The appellant is a citizen of Ecuador whose application for a permanent
   residence card under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006
   Regulations") was refused by the respondent.


3. The respondent's reason for refusing the application was that
   insufficient evidence was submitted by the appellant to establish that
   his wife, a national of Spain with whom he has been married since 2006,
   had been exercising Treaty Rights in the UK for the requisite five year
   period under section 15(1)(b) of the 2006 Regulations.


1. Section 15(1)(b) of the 2006 Regulations provides that a permanent right
   of residence will be acquired by a family member of an EEA national who
   has resided in the UK with the EEA national family member in accordance
   with the 2006 Regulations for a continuous period of five years.

2. It is not in dispute that the appellant is the family member of an EEA
   national and that they have resided together in the UK for the requisite
   period. The only issue is whether the appellant's wife has been
   exercising Treaty Rights for over five continuous years.


3. Mr Kandola acknowledged that the respondent has issued a residence card
   to the appellant's wife recognising that she has a right to permanent
   residence on the basis of having exercised Treaty Rights in the UK for a
   continuous period of five years and that as a consequence the reason for
   refusing the appellant permanent residence under Section 15(1)(b) falls
   away.


4. Accordingly, as the requirements under Section 15(1)(b) of the 2006
   Regulations are satisfied, the appeal is allowed.



Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of
    law and is set aside.

 2. I remake the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal under the 2006
    Regulations.
