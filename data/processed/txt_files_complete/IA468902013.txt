Representation:

For the Appellant (Secretary of State):       Mr P Nath, Home Office
Presenting Officer
For the Respondent (Mrs Kehinde):          Mr F Oweka (Solicitor) of Samuel
& Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against a  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Monro promulgated on  31  March  2014  following  a
    hearing at Hatton Cross on 17  March  2014.   For  ease  of  reference,
    throughout this determination I shall refer to the Secretary of  State,
    who was the original respondent, as "the Secretary of State" and to Mrs
    Kehinde, who was the original appellant, as "the claimant".

 2. This appeal was before me on 20 June 2014 when I found an error of  law
    in Judge Monro's determination.   What  will  now  follow  within  this
    determination is a repetition of the substance of the Decision  I  gave
    following that hearing.

 3. The claimant is a national of Nigeria who was born on 19 December 1937.
     Until the events which form the subject of this appeal  she  lived  in
    Nigeria but a number of her children live in the United  Kingdom.   She
    entered this country on 7 August 2012 on a multi-visit visa valid  from
    5 September 2011 until 5 September 2016.  The terms  on  which  she  is
    allowed to enter this country pursuant to this visa are that she is  on
    every occasion she visits required to leave before the  expiry  of  six
    months.

 4. On this occasion the claimant did not leave before 7 February  2013  as
    she ought in accordance with the terms of her visa but on  14  February
    2013 she applied for indefinite leave to remain in this country  for  a
    purpose not covered by the Immigration Rules.  On 3 October  2013  this
    application was refused by the Secretary of State and  a  decision  was
    taken to remove her by way  of  directions  under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.   The  claimant  appealed
    against this decision and it was this appeal  which  was  heard  before
    Judge Monro as noted above.

 5.  The  Secretary  of  State's  reasons  for  refusing   the   claimant's
    application and for issuing removal directions are set out at paragraph
    2 of Judge Monro's determination and were as follows:

         "a)  the appellant told the Entry Clearance Officer that she  would
             visit for only three months

         b)   it was asserted on the appellant's behalf that  the  situation
             in Kaduna is not stable and is subject  to  bomb  attacks  and
             that home help is becoming unreliable due to this

         c)   the appellant has not stated how she is personally affected by
             this situation

         d)   it is stated that the appellant has a son  living  in  another
             part of Nigeria but the appellant has not given any reason why
             she could not relocate or live with him

         e)   the medical condition from which  the  appellant  suffers  had
             been treated in Nigeria and no reason has been given as to why
             this could not continue

         f)   it was not  considered  that  returning  the  appellant  would
             breach Article 2 or 3

         g)   as leave is being sought for a  purpose  not  covered  by  the
             Rules the application is refused under  paragraph  322(1)  and
             since the appellant declared that she  was  coming  for  three
             months only it is also refused under 322(7) as she  failed  to
             honour the declaration as to the intended duration of her stay

         h)   the appellant does not meet the criteria relating to family or
             private life under Appendix FM and the application is  refused
             under paragraph 276CE".

         The statement of the Secretary of State's reasons  was  taken  from
         the refusal letter.

 6. Having heard evidence from the claimant and other members of her family
    Judge Monro allowed her appeal for  the  reasons  set  out  within  the
    determination.  Amongst these reasons the judge stated  as  follows  at
    paragraphs 27 and 28:

         "27. The appellant has not claimed asylum but clearly the situation
             in Kaduna is a worrying one for her and her family here, and I
             accept the evidence I have heard that  home  help  has  become
             very difficult to obtain in the current climate of violence.

         28.  I find that the combination of the  appellant's  age,  medical
             condition, lack of network and support  in  Kaduna  and  local
             conditions  are  factors  that  impact  significantly  on  the
             appellant's ability to live her private  life,  and  that  the
             private life she enjoys with her family in the United Kingdom,
             which is free of the fear that  she  experiences  in  Nigeria,
             cannot  be  replicated  if  she  is  returned  there.   Having
             carefully considered the evidence and relevant case law I find
             that the right of the respondent to operate a  firm  fair  and
             consistent immigration policy has been outweighed in this case
             by the particular circumstances of this appellant and that the
             decision is not proportionate."

 7. The Secretary of State as noted has appealed against this decision  and
    the grounds, whilst succinct, are comprehensive.  It  is  argued  first
    that the judge

         "failed to identify the factors raising an arguable case that there
         are compelling circumstances not  sufficiently  recognised  in  the
         Rules to ground a grant of leave outside the Rules",

    relying on the judgment given by Sales J in Nagre [2013]  EWHC  720  in
    which the judge held as follows:

         "The new Rules do provide better explicit coverage of  the  factors
         identified in case law as relevant  to  analysis  of  claims  under
         Article 8 than was formerly the position, so in many cases the main
         points for consideration in relation to Article 8 will be addressed
         by decision-makers applying the new Rules.  It is  only  if,  after
         doing that, there remains an arguable case that there may  be  good
         grounds for granting  leave  outside  the  Rules  by  reference  to
         Article 8 that it will be necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on
         to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling   circumstances   not
         sufficiently recognised under the new Rules to require the grant of
         such leave."

 8. The reference  to  the  "new  Rules"  within  the  judgment  are  those
    contained within Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of  the  Rules  which
    came into effect in July 2012.  It is asserted within the grounds  that
    it was incumbent on the judge to identify  what  were  the  "compelling
    circumstances not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the  new  Rules  to
    require the grant of such leave" and that the  judge  did  not  do  so.
    While holding that the consideration under  the  Rules  had  not  fully
    addressed all of the private life issues arising under Article  8,  she
    had not listed those specific  factors  said  to  be  such  "compelling
    circumstances" which were not covered within the Rules.

 9. It is then  argued  that  the  judge  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
    requirements in the EC-DR Section of Appendix FM which it is said  "was
    a relevant Immigration Rule and thus a relevant  consideration  in  the
    proportionality exercise".  In this regard reliance was placed  on  the
    determination of this Tribunal in Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT  640  in  which
    Cranston J (sitting with Upper Tribunal Judge Taylor) did  not  approve
    of a "free-wheeling Article 8  analysis,  unencumbered  by  the  Rules"
    which the Tribunal in that case held was "not  the  correct  approach".
    The judge then goes on to find in that  case  that  "the  Secretary  of
    State had addressed Article  8  family  aspects  of  the  [appellant's]
    position through the Rules...  The judge should have done likewise."

10. The next submission contained within the grounds is that the judge  had
    failed to have regard to  "the  public  interest  in  firm  immigration
    control, a relevant consideration  in  any  Article  8  proportionality
    evaluation".

11. Essentially the argument in  this  case  is  that  the  judge  did  not
    consider the importance of maintaining a  fair  system  of  immigration
    control, not just  because  of  the  individual  circumstances  in  any
    particular case but also because otherwise it would  be  impossible  to
    maintain a fair system for everyone.  In particular, reliance here  was
    made on the earlier case of Razgar where the House of Lords had  stated
    at paragraph 20 that considerations of proportionality

         "must always involve the striking of a  fair  balance  between  the
         rights of the individual and the interests of the  community  which
         is inherent in the whole of the Convention"

    and that

         "decisions taken pursuant to the lawful  operation  of  immigration
         control will be proportionate in  all  save  a  small  minority  of
         exceptional cases, identifiable only on a case by case basis."

12. Reliance was then placed upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in FK
    & OK (Botswana) [2013] EWCA Civ 238 in which  Stanley  Burnton  LJ  had
    held as follows:

         "The second reason is that the maintenance of  immigration  control
         is not an aim that is implied for the purposes of Article 8.2.  Its
         maintenance is necessary in order to  preserve  or  to  foster  the
         economic well-being of the country, in order to protect health  and
         morals, and for the  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedoms  of
         others.  If there were no immigration control, enormous numbers  of
         persons would be able to enter this country, and would be  entitled
         to claim social security benefits, the  benefits  of  the  National
         Health Service, to be housed (or to compete for housing with  those
         in this country) and to compete for employment with  those  already
         here.  Their children would be  entitled  to  be  educated  at  the
         taxpayers' expense (as was the second appellant).  All such matters
         (and I do not suggest that they are the only  matters)  go  to  the
         economic well-being of the country.  That the individuals concerned
         in the present case are  law-abiding  (other  than  in  respect  of
         immigration controls) does not  detract  from  the  fact  that  the
         maintenance of a generally applicable immigration policy is, albeit
         indirectly, a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 8.2."

13. Then reliance was also placed on  the  decision  of  this  Tribunal  in
    Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  Pakistan  [2014]  UKUT  85  where  at
    paragraph 25 the Upper Tribunal had criticised a  First-tier  Judge  in
    the following terms:

         "Although making reference to 'the legitimate aim of  securing  the
         economic well-being of the  UK  by  sensible  immigration  control'
         (which clearly identified that this head extended  to  the  general
         (or 'macro') level, he wholly confined his actual assessment of the
         weight to be attached to the legitimate aim pursued by the decision
         of the [Secretary of State] to a simple calculus at the  individual
         or 'micro' level, so that all that appeared in  the  balance  sheet
         were the funds the claimant had paid in course fees  and  the  fact
         that he had enough to maintain and accommodate himself.  He  wholly
         overlooked that even in cases where there is no cost to  the  state
         incurred by an individual student in terms of fees and  maintenance
         and accommodation, the Immigration Rules reflect an assessment made
         by  the  government  with  the  sanction  of  Parliament  of   what
         requirements are necessary in order to ensure sufficient control on
         the number of persons entering into or being able to stay in the UK
         and  for  how  long  and  under  what  conditions.    Their   terms
         quintessentially require an assessment at the  'macro'  level.   He
         failed to take into account whether general  aspects  of  'economic
         well-being', including the need  to  limit  the  numbers  who  have
         access to public services and the benefits of the NHS and  who  are
         able to compete for housing and for employment with  those  already
         here: see FK & OK [11]..."

The Error of Law Hearing

14. Having heard submissions on behalf of both parties (which are  set  out
    within paragraphs 13 to 17 of my earlier decision) I found  that  Judge
    Monro's determination had contained an  error  of  law  such  that  the
    decision had to be re-made.  I gave my reasons as now follows.

15. I found that the claimant clearly did not have any right to  remain  in
    this country under the substantive Rule.   Her  claim  essentially  was
    founded on her Article 8 rights which had to be considered first  under
    paragraph 276ADE of the Rules in conjunction with  Appendix  FM.   What
    was  required  (as  is  clear  from  existing  jurisprudence)   was   a
    consideration of whether, having weighed up fairly all the factors both
    as to why the claimant should be allowed to remain and why it is in the
    wider public interest that she should not, it would  be  "unjustifiably
    harsh" to require her to return.

16. I agreed with Ms Kenny (who represented the Secretary of State  at  the
    error of law hearing), relying on  the  grounds  of  appeal,  that  the
    public interest reasons why the Immigration Rules  should  be  enforced
    could not just be considered  on  the  "micro"  level  but  had  to  be
    considered on the "macro" level as well (to use the  wording  contained
    within Shahzad).  In other words, it was not sufficient simply to  have
    regard to whether or not the claimant was being  looked  after  by  her
    family without immediate recourse to public funds, but it was necessary
    also to consider this country's need to have a  system  of  immigration
    control which is fairly and consistently enforced for  the  benefit  of
    everyone.

17. The general expectation must be that  where  a  person  comes  to  this
    country under a visit visa which allows that person to remain for up to
    six months at a time (especially in circumstances where that person has
    told the Entry Clearance Officer that she intended only to  remain  for
    three months) that person would leave within the time she was permitted
    to remain here and did not overstay.  I found that it  did  not  appear
    from  Judge  Monro's  determination   that   she   had   given   proper
    consideration to the importance of maintaining a  fair  and  consistent
    immigration policy for the benefit of society in general.  If  she  had
    considered this, it was not apparent from the  determination  that  she
    had, which was why I considered that this aspect of that  determination
    was inadequately reasoned.

18. I found that it was also not clear from the determination  what  weight
    the judge had given to the  various  factors  referred  to  within  the
    determination.  Although it is not incumbent on the judge  to  set  out
    every single piece of evidence  and  every  single  factor  within  the
    determination, nonetheless a judge is required to set out  the  reasons
    in such a way that someone reading the determination can  be  satisfied
    that  the  judge  has  had  proper  regard  to   all   the   arguments.
    Regrettably, in this case this was not apparent from the determination.



19. I found that the starting point  in  this  case  in  light  of  current
    jurisprudence must be that the expectation would be that this  claimant
    should have returned home and that before being allowed to  remain  she
    needs to establish that the circumstances were sufficiently  compelling
    that it would be "unjustifiably harsh" for her to return to Nigeria.  I
    then stated that while it may be that she would be able to  do  so,  it
    was not clear from Judge Monro's determination that she had ever  asked
    herself this question.  It  accordingly  followed  that  Judge  Monro's
    determination must be set aside and the decision re-made.

20. Following discussion and having  had  regard  to  paragraph  7  of  the
    President's Practice Statement, I considered that it was appropriate to
    re-make the decision myself rather than remit the appeal  back  to  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  for  re-hearing.   I  had  particular  regard  to
    paragraph 7.2 of the statement where it was said that:

         "The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion [where an error
         of law has been found] to proceed to re-make the decision,  instead
         of remitting the case to the First-tier Tribunal and that an appeal
         should only be remitted in circumstances where either the effect of
         the error has  been  to  deprive  a  party  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity  for  that  party's
         case to be put to and considered by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  or
         where the nature or extent of any judicial fact-finding  which  was
         necessary in order to the decision to  be  re-made  is  such  that,
         having regard to  the  overriding  objective  in  Rule  2,  it  was
         appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal."

21. I also had regard to what was said at 7.3, which is that:

         "Re-making rather than remitting will nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact-finding is necessary".

22. In this case, I considered that even though I would have to  carry  out
    some further  fact-finding  the  overriding  objective  could  best  be
    maintained by my re-hearing the appeal.

23. Accordingly, I adjourned the hearing until 31 July 2014 following which
    hearing I would re-make the decision, and I directed that the  claimant
    would be permitted to adduce further evidence in support of her  appeal
    and  in  particular  directed  to  her  argument  that  it   would   be
    "unjustifiably harsh" to require her to return to Nigeria.  However,  I
    also directed that this evidence should be filed with the Tribunal  and
    served on the respondent by no later than Friday, 11 July 2014 and that
    this evidence should  include  in  respect  of  every  witness  it  was
    intended should  give  evidence,  including  the  claimant,  a  witness
    statement capable of standing as evidence-in-chief.

The Resumed Hearing

24. Regrettably, the directions which I made following the earlier  hearing
    were not served on the parties until very close to the resumed  hearing
    and so the statements were not served in accordance with the directions
    which I had given.  However, in light of the explanation given for this
    (which was that the directions had not been served) on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State, Mr  Nath  very  properly  did  not  object  to  the
    claimant and members of her family giving evidence, which they did.

25. Accordingly, I heard evidence from the appellant and  from  members  of
    her family, who were  cross-examined.   I  then  heard  submissions  on
    behalf of both the claimant and the Secretary of State.  As I attempted
    to record everything which was said to me both by the witnesses and  by
    the respective representatives within the Record of Proceedings which I
    took, I shall not set out below a full record of these proceedings, but
    shall refer only  to  such  of  the  evidence  and  submissions  as  is
    necessary for the purposes of this determination.  However, I have  had
    regard to everything which was said to me  during  the  course  of  the
    hearing, as well as to all the documents contained within the file.

Discussion

26. As I have already indicated, in order  for  the  claimant's  appeal  to
    succeed it is not sufficient that she  establishes  merely  that  on  a
    micro level there is little cost to the  country  in  allowing  her  to
    remain.  If that were so, then there would be little  point  in  having
    the Rules in place.  As made clear by this  Tribunal  in  Shahzad,  the
    Tribunal must give great weight to the legitimate and necessary aim  of
    securing the economic wellbeing of the country by maintaining  sensible
    immigration control.  As the Tribunal noted in Shahzad,  this  includes
    "the need to limit the numbers who have access to public  services  and
    the benefits of the NHS and who are able to compete for housing and for
    employment with those already here".

27. The Tribunal also has to have in mind the provisions of part 5A of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  which  was  inserted  by
    Section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014, of  which  the  relevant  parts
    provide as follows:

         "19. Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest consideration

             After part 5 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
             2002 insert -

                                  "PART 5A

            ARTICLE 8 OF THE ECHR: PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS

             117A Application of this Part

             (1)  This part applies where a court or Tribunal is required
                  to determine whether a decision made under the Immigration
                  Act -

                  (a)  breaches a person's right to respect for private and
                      family life under Article 8, and

                  (b)  as a result would be unlawful under Section 6 of the
                      Human Rights Act 1998.

             (2)  In considering the public interest question the court or
                  Tribunal must (in particular) have regard -

                  (a)  in all cases, to the considerations listed in Section
                      117B, and

                  (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign
                      criminals, to the considerations listed in Section
                      117C.

             (3)  In sub-Section (2), "the public interest question" means
                  the question of whether an interference with a person's
                  right to respect for private and family life is justified
                  under Article 8(2).

             117B  Article 8: public interest considerations applicable  in
             all cases

             (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
                  the public interest.

             (2)  It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
                  interests  of  the  economic  well-being  of  the   United
                  Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain  in  the
                  United Kingdom are able to speak English, because  persons
                  who can speak English -

                  (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

             (3)  It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
                  interests  of  the  economic  well-being  of  the   United
                  Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain  in  the
                  United Kingdom are financially independent,  because  such
                  persons -

                  (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

             (4)  Little weight should be given to -

                  (a)  a private life, or

                  (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

                  that is established by a person at a time when the  person
                  is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

             (5)   Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private   life
                  established by a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's
                  immigration status is precarious.

             (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
                  the public interest does not require the person's  removal
                  where -

                  (a)  the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                      relationship with a qualifying child, and

                  (b)  it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                      leave the United Kingdom.

             117C  [this applies to foreign criminals, and is therefore not
                  relevant in this case]..." ".

28. These provisions reinforce what was said by this Tribunal in Shahzad as
    to the need for the  Tribunal  to  give  great  weight  to  the  public
    interest in maintaining effective immigration controls.   This  is  now
    set out in terms at paragraph 117B(1).  So far as 117B(2) is concerned,
    the claimant clearly speaks English and with regard to 117B(3),  having
    heard the evidence from the  members  of  her  family,  I  am  entirely
    satisfied that she will be "financially independent" in the sense  that
    her family have more than sufficient funds in  order  to  maintain  her
    adequately.  The daughter with whom the claimant currently lives  earns
    about �40,000 a year as a care home manager  while  her  husband  is  a
    senior manager in a hospital and earns about �50,000 a year.  While the
    claimant would doubtless utilise some of the health services  available
    in this country, I do not consider that in any meaningful sense it  can
    properly be said that if she is allowed to stay she would be a  "burden
    on taxpayers".  While this does not lessen the  weight  which  must  be
    given by the Tribunal to the public  interest  in  enforcing  effective
    immigration control, and  does  not  reduce  the  requirement  for  the
    claimant to show that her removal would still be "unjustifiably harsh",
    it does nonetheless mean that she does not have the  additional  hurdle
    of overcoming this particular objection.

29. With regard to 117B(4) and (5) this claimant's private and family  life
    was not established merely in the small period  during  which  she  has
    remained in this country after  the  expiry  of  her  right  to  remain
    pursuant to her visit visa, but over her lifetime.   Having  heard  the
    evidence I am satisfied that it was because  of  these  ties  that  her
    family did not wish her  to  return.   Accordingly,  having  considered
    Section 117A and 117B of the 1972 Act (as inserted by Section 19 of the
    Immigration Act 2014) it is now necessary to consider this appeal  with
    reference to the factors which I identified in my earlier decision,  as
    set out above.

30. I now consider the reasons given by the Secretary of State for refusing
    the claimant's application as set out at paragraph 5  above.   I  shall
    adopt the same numbering as contained within that paragraph:

    (a)  Although it is not disputed  that  the  claimant  told  the  Entry
          Clearance Officer that  she  intended  to  visit  for  only  three
          months, I accept the evidence given to me that that had  been  her
          genuine intention at the time.  I accept that she was persuaded by
          her children and son-in-law to remain because they were worried as
          to the consequences were she  to  return.   Although  (as  I  find
          below) I do not consider that the  level  of  risk  posed  by  the
          activities of  Boku  Haram  within  Kaduna  (which  is  where  the
          claimant lives in Nigeria) are at such a level as to  entitle  her
          to humanitarian protection, nonetheless I  do  accept  that  these
          activities (to which reference is made  at  Annex  E  of  the  COI
          Report of 14 June 2013, to which I was referred) are such that the
          claimant would  have  great  difficulty  in  obtaining  day-to-day
          support within Kaduna which she would need.   This  was  a  factor
          taken into consideration by Judge Monro, and although her decision
          must be set  aside  because  she  did  not  demonstrate  that  she
          necessarily gave sufficient  weight  to  the  public  interest  in
          removal, I agree with her finding that the claimant would find  it
          difficult to obtain the necessary  level  of  support  on  return.
          This is a factor which in itself carries some weight,  but  it  is
          also relevant when  considering  whether  or  not  the  claimant's
          family in this country had a reason for wanting  their  mother  to
          remain.  The background evidence which I have seen  suggests  that
          the situation was deteriorating within Kaduna progressively.

    (b and c)     I  heard  evidence  as  to  how  the  claimant  would  be
          personally affected by  the  deteriorating  situation  in  Kaduna,
          which was to the effect that whereas  formerly  she  could  employ
          people to assist her in the home,  because  of  the  deteriorating
          situation, nobody would now stay for any length of time.

    (d)  Regarding the claimant's son who lives in Abuja, I accept that the
          claimant has only had very limited contact with him, and that this
          is because she does not get on with her daughter-in-law.  I  heard
          evidence, which I accept, that in the period  since  the  claimant
          has been in this country she has only spoken  on  the  phone  with
          this son once, and also that he and his wife live in a two bedroom
          flat together with their children.  I do not consider it would  be
          either reasonable or realistic to expect this claimant, at the age
          of 76, to leave the area within Nigeria where she currently has  a
          home in order to live in cramped circumstances with a son and  his
          family with whom she does not get on.  Further, on the balance  of
          probabilities, on the basis of the evidence  which  has  been  put
          before the Tribunal, I do not consider that her son  would  permit
          her to do so, either.

    (e)  I do not  consider  that  the  claimant's  medical  conditions  as
          referred to in evidence are  such  as  to  give  rise  to  a  free
          standing Article 8 claim and  nor  do  I  consider  these  medical
          conditions to be a significant factor in this claim (save  insofar
          as the Tribunal recognises that the claimant would have difficulty
          in coping with her day-to-day needs without support).

    (f)  The return of this claimant would  not  breach  Article  3  rights
          either.

    (g)  The claimant is not entitled to permission  to  remain  under  the
          Rules, so this objection does not touch directly on her Article  8
          claim.  However, were I satisfied that  the  claimant  had  always
          intended to remain, notwithstanding what she had  told  the  Entry
          Clearance Officer before she came, this would have been  a  factor
          to which I would have attached weight when considering whether her
          removal would be disproportionate for Article 8 purposes.  For the
          reasons I have already given, I do not so find.

    (h)  It is not suggested that the claimant meets the criteria  relating
          to family or private life under Appendix FM.   The  basis  of  her
          claim is that her removal would be in  breach  of  her  Article  8
          rights.

31. Having set out my conclusions with regard to the matters raised by  the
    Secretary of State, I must now consider this appeal  having  regard  to
    the very great public interest in maintaining  a  fair  and  consistent
    system of immigration control.  As I have already stated, it  is  clear
    from current jurisprudence that a claim can only succeed under  Article
    8 outside the provisions of 276ADE and  Appendix  FM  where  there  are
    compelling circumstances not specifically recognised within  the  Rules
    such that the consequences of removal would be  "unjustifiably  harsh".
    This would only be the case rarely, such that it would be the exception
    rather than the rule.

32. As this claimant cannot succeed under the  specific  provisions  within
    the Rules, it is incumbent now on this Tribunal to consider whether  or
    not, when considering all the factors in this case, her  removal  would
    nonetheless be "unjustifiably harsh".

33. The claimant is a 76  year  old  lady,  who,  I  accept  (having  heard
    evidence on this point) has very few friends now left  in  Kaduna.   As
    her children told the Tribunal, although she does still have some  ties
    there, most of her former friends  have  either  died  or  moved  away.
    Although she has a son living in Abuja, she is not close to him and has
    only limited contact with this son and his family.  While  her  medical
    condition on its own is not such that her removal would be in breach of
    her Article 3 or Article 8 rights, it does make her more reliant on day
    to day assistance with the tasks she would have to carry out,  such  as
    shopping and keeping the house, and because of the current situation in
    Kaduna, which shows no sign of improving, she would find it  difficult,
    if not impossible, to obtain such help.  Although I  have  had  to  set
    aside  Judge  Monro's  decision  for  the  reasons  I  have  given,   I
    nonetheless  agree  with  her  finding,  at   paragraph   28   of   her
    determination, "that the combination of the [claimant's]  age,  medical
    condition, lack of network and support in Kaduna and  local  conditions
    are factors that impact significantly on  [her]  ability  to  live  her
    private life, and that the private life she enjoys with her  family  in
    the United Kingdom, which is free of the fear that she  experiences  in
    Nigeria, cannot be replicated if she is returned there".

34. I accept that the claimant was previously  being  maintained  with  the
    assistance of the financial support she was receiving from  her  family
    in this country.  Although the Rules have now been changed, I  consider
    that had this claimant applied prior to  9  July  2012  for  indefinite
    leave to enter this country as  the  parent  dependent  relative  of  a
    person present and settled in the United Kingdom under paragraph 317 of
    the Rules, that application would have been  likely  to  succeed.   The
    requirement set out in paragraph 317(i)(a) is satisfied (she is over 65
    and on her own); 317(ii) is  satisfied  because  she  would  have  been
    joining her children present and  settled  in  this  country;  317(iii)
    would  have  been  satisfied,  because  I  accept  that  she  was  then
    "financially wholly or  mainly  dependent"  on  her  children  in  this
    country.

35. I am also satisfied that the maintenance and accommodation  requirement
    set  out  in  paragraphs  317(iv)  and  (iva)  are  satisfied  and   in
    particular, as provided within (v) she has no other close  relative  in
    her own country to whom she could turn  for  financial  support.   This
    follows on from my findings in relation to her son, as set out above.

36. Although the current appeal cannot succeed on the basis of a near-miss,
    when considering the position of this claimant overall,  especially  in
    the context of a suggestion that she always intended to  overstay,  the
    fact that had she so intended, she would until very shortly before  she
    came have been able to arrange to do so lawfully in accordance with the
    Rules then in force, is not irrelevant.

37. The claimant's son-in-law said in evidence that his real fear was  that
    if returned now his mother-in-law would be  obliged  to  live  out  the
    remainder of her life as a lonely old woman, in  increasing  isolation,
    with little day-to-day help available, in circumstances where she had a
    loving family (including children and  grandchildren  to  whom  she  is
    close) in  this  country,  who  are  in  a  position  to  maintain  and
    accommodate her adequately.   I  find  that  this  fear  is  justified.
    Accordingly, the cost to this individual claimant of the  Secretary  of
    State maintaining a strict system of immigration control (which is  for
    the benefit of the public generally) is that instead of being  able  to
    live out the remainder of her days surrounded by a family who love  her
    and care for her,  she  would  instead  be  obliged  to  return  to  an
    existence which would become increasingly isolated and  miserable,  and
    where she would lack even the day to day support which might  make  her
    existence tolerable.

38. I am entirely satisfied that were this to be the case,  the  effect  on
    her family as well would be devastating.

39. It is in the context of these findings that I have to consider  whether
    the compassionate factors in this case are sufficiently compelling that
    I can fairly find  that  the  consequences  of  her  removal  would  be
    "unjustifiably harsh" notwithstanding the great weight which has to  be
    given to the public interest in only rarely and exceptionally  granting
    permission to remain under Article 8 to someone  who  otherwise  cannot
    succeed under the Rules.

40. In my judgment, having considered very carefully  all  the  factors  in
    this case, this is one of those very rare cases where the  reasons  for
    allowing this claimant to remain  are  sufficiently  compelling  as  to
    outweigh that public interest.

41. It accordingly follows that this appeal must be allowed, and I so find.



Decision

I set  aside  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Monro  as
containing an error of law and substitute the following decision:

The claimant's appeal is allowed, on human rights grounds, Article 8.
