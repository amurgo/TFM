For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  O'Keeffe
    made following a hearing on 12th October 2018.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 1st January 2000.  He
    arrived in the UK in August 2015 and  claimed  asylum  on  6th  October
    2015.  He was refused and upon appeal Judge Lucas allowed the appeal to
    the extent that the respondent was required to reconsider the claim  to
    comply with the statutory requirements with regard to Section 55.   Two
    years  later,  on  6th  September  2018,  the  respondent  refused  the
    application again.  Judge O'Keeffe dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

 3. The matter then came before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Zucker who  did
    not disturb Judge O'Keeffe's conclusions with  respect  to  the  asylum
    claim but found that the judge had erred in law in concluding that  the
    appellant did not enjoy family life with his uncle.  Accordingly he had
    not properly  engaged  with  the  proportionality  of  the  appellant's
    removal. In particular he had not considered the argument  put  forward
    by Mr Bazini that it was relevant that the  appellant  had  suffered  a
    historic wrong as a minor without family  connections  in  Afghanistan,
    and on that basis he ought to have been granted status.

 4. Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Zucker  was  not  able  to  conclude  the
    remaking  of  the  decision  because  Mr  Bazini  wanted  to  call  the
    appellant's uncle to give evidence and reserved the matter  to  himself
    in the Upper Tribunal.  It was then transferred to me.  A copy of Judge
    Zucker's determination is appended to this.

The Evidence

 5. The appellant, his uncle [AK] and the Learning and Project Co-ordinator
    for Kent Refugee Action Network, Ms [BC], all gave brief oral  evidence
    which is uncontroversial.  The appellant's girlfriend also  produced  a
    witness statement but did not attend.  He has been attending Canterbury
    College and has passed level two in English and maths and motor vehicle
    maintenance level one.  He has been accepted for a one year engineering
    course  at  the  college  following  which  he  wants  to  study  civil
    engineering at university.  He lives with his uncle and  his  wife  and
    three cousins and he has a girlfriend.   He  did  not  know  where  the
    future lies, but said it was a serious relationship.

 6. Mr Tufan asked him about the conditions to which he would be  returning
    in Kabul.  It was accepted by the original judge and not challenged  by
    the respondent that his family left Afghanistan together and that  they
    were separated during the journey and there  was  no  immediate  family
    protection available to him on return.

 7. His uncle said that the appellant's father, his brother, used to have a
    house in Kabul and in 2017 he went there  in  order  to  see  what  the
    situation was like.  He visited the local  government  office  and  was
    told that they had no idea where his brother was and he discovered that
    the family home had been  taken  over  by  different  people  who  were
    selling wood there.  He was frightened  to  approach  them  because  he
    thought that he might be attacked if he said  that  he  had  come  from
    Europe and might be wanting to take back the house.  Mr [AK] said  that
    he used to go to Kabul more regularly when his  father  was  alive  but
    since he died in 2014 he had only been there on the one occasion.  When
    asked whether the appellant could live in his  grandfather's  house  he
    said that it would be difficult to kick someone out.  He also said that
    whilst it was possible for him to support the appellant in  the  UK  he
    would have difficulty in sending money  him  in  Afghanistan  since  he
    earned �25,000 a year and had three children of his own to support.

 8. [BC] said that the appellant was a  model  student  with  a  very  good
    attitude and a good influence on his peers.  However he was also  quite
    na�ve and she was not sure whether he would survive  in  South  London,
    never mind Kabul since he was not streetwise.

Submissions

 9. Mr Tufan submitted that the appellant had not been in the  UK  for  any
    length of time.  He had made an unfounded asylum claim and  his  status
    he had always been precarious.  Little weight should be  given  to  the
    family life which he enjoyed with his uncle in these circumstances.  He
    was a healthy young man with potentially two  homes  to  return  to  in
    Kabul and would therefore be in a better situation than many  returnees
    particularly since he had the benefit of a British education and  could
    speak good English.  He would also have access to government funds from
    the voluntary departure scheme.

10. Mr Bazini submitted that there were a number of factors which made  the
    appellant's removal disproportionate.  He had arrived as a  minor  when
    he was 15 years old and after a few months in  foster  care  had  lived
    with his uncle ever since.  He had established a family life  not  only
    with his uncle but with his cousins particularly his male  cousin  with
    whom he shared a bedroom and their best interests needed  to  be  taken
    into account.

11. The appellant had not been well served by  the  administration  of  the
    respondent.  He  referred  me  to  the  determination  of  Judge  Lucas
    promulgated on 15th November 2016 which recorded  that  the  respondent
    had failed to comply with directions and had not produced a  bundle  at
    the hearing.  He wrote

         "The Tribunal is  troubled  by  the  state  of  this  case  and  in
         particular the failure of the respondent  properly  to  respond  to
         directions by producing an appeal bundle for  this  hearing.   This
         presents the Tribunal with a practical difficulty in  that  it  has
         therefore  no  access  to  the  appellant's  screening  or   asylum
         interviews or indeed any  other  documents  contained  within  that
         bundle.   This  is  of  importance  because  in  large   part   the
         appellant's claim is refused on the basis of inconsistency and lack
         of credibility of his answers  in  interview.   It  really  is  not
         acceptable for  the  respondent  to  place  the  Tribunal  in  this
         invidious position.

         Of even more  concern  the  Tribunal  is  not  satisfied  that  the
         respondent properly has carried  out  her  statutory  duties  under
         Section 55 with regard to reception facilities  and  the  issue  of
         tracing.  It is mindful of the decision  in  KA  (Afghanistan)  and
         Others [2012] EWCA Civ 1014.

         The respondent has stated that the appellant has failed to  provide
         details of his family and  their  last  address  but  this  is  not
         consistent with the evidence of  the  appellant  and  the  identity
         document copied at page 9 of the appellant's bundle...

         The Tribunal is therefore not content with the state of  this  case
         and also with the obligations  imposed  upon  the  respondent  with
         regard to Section 55.  There is a fundamental lack of precision and
         the Tribunal is not satisfied that the claim of the  appellant  has
         been properly considered."

12. Accordingly the judge remitted the case back to the respondent because,
    inter alia, the decision was fundamentally flawed since the  respondent
    had not considered her duties under Section 55.  Had she  done  so  the
    appellant would have been entitled to succeed since he would have  been
    found to have been at real risk of persecution as an  unattached  child
    who had lost all contact with  his  family  (AA  (unattended  children)
    Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 16).

13. Mr Bazini did not seek to argue that this required a  grant  of  status
    but he did submit that the historic wrong was a relevant factor in  the
    assessment of proportionality.  The situation  was  compounded  by  the
    subsequent two year delay in the consideration of the appellant's  case
    during which time the appellant's family  and  private  life  developed
    further.  The appellant integrated  into  British  society  and  has  a
    girlfriend here and attends the mosque rarely. It  was  unrealistic  to
    suggest that he would be able to take over his home in Kabul  as  a  19
    year old from the United Kingdom.  Moreover  the  latest  UNHCR  advice
    unequivocally concluded that an internal  flight  alternative  was  not
    generally available in Kabul.

Findings and Conclusions

14. Mr Tufan did not seek to argue that there was not family life  in  this
    case.  That follows from Judge  Zucker's  determination  which  records
    that the Presenting Officer before him accepted  that  it  was  plainly
    wrong that it had not been  demonstrated  that  the  appellant  enjoyed
    family life in the UK.   The  judge  found  that  the  uncle  had  been
    providing everything for the appellant  here  and  indeed  acknowledged
    that family life between adult relatives does not cease immediately  at
    adulthood.  Judge Zucker recorded that there was no bright line between
    childhood and adulthood and said that there was no  evidence  that  the
    appellant was living an independent life.

15. Mr Tufan's case is that little weight  ought  to  be  accorded  to  the
    appellant's family life since it was established at  a  time  when  his
    status had always been precarious and there were no unjustifiably harsh
    consequences for this appellant were he to be returned to  Kabul  as  a
    fit and healthy young man with potentially two houses at  his  disposal
    and the benefit of a British education.

16. Against that, it  is  quite  clear  that  the  family  life  which  the
    appellant presently enjoys with his uncle and his uncle's children will
    come to an complete end upon his  removal.   His  uncle  said  that  he
    regards the appellant as his own child and he is like a brother to  his
    children.  He gives him everything that he needs.  His evidence was not
    challenged by Mr Tufan and there  is  no  basis  upon  which  it  could
    reasonably concluded that the appellant is not regarded as an  integral
    part of the family.  I conclude that it is clear that  his  uncle  aunt
    and  cousins  would  be  significantly  affected  by  the   appellant's
    departure.

17. I was impressed by the fact that Ms [C] took the trouble to come to the
    Tribunal to support him.  He is clearly an ambitious young man  and  it
    is hard to see how he could pursue his wish to become a civil  engineer
    if he were to be returned.  Her  comment  that  he  would  struggle  to
    survive in South London was striking.

18. The appellant's integration in the family and his ability to pursue his
    studies have been facilitated by the respondent's  mishandling  of  his
    case, first by reaching an unlawful decision which, had  it  been  made
    correctly, would have entitled the  appellant  to  refugee  status  and
    second, by a delay of two years which allowed the appellant  to  deepen
    his ties in the UK.

19. I do not accept Mr Tufan's submission that  the  appellant  potentially
    has two houses to return to.  The basis of  the  uncle's  evidence  was
    that they have been occupied by  others  and  the  uncle  himself  felt
    nervous about approaching the new occupants.  It is pure speculation to
    believe that the appellant, who has been described by Ms [C]  as  na�ve
    and lacking street knowledge, could approach  the  occupants  of  those
    houses and proceed to evict them and live in one of them himself.

20. The appellant would be returning as someone who has no  connections  to
    Kabul having no family there and having left at the age of 15.  He  has
    a Greek girlfriend and does not attend mosque regularly. He has adopted
    a western lifestyle.

21. The latest UNHCR report dated 30th  August  2018  reports  on  negative
    trends in relation to the security situation for  civilians  in  Kabul.
    UNAMA reported 993 civilian casualties in  Kabul  province  during  the
    first six months  of  2018  and  stated  that  they  were  mainly  from
    indiscriminate attacks in Kabul city.  UNHCR noted that  civilians  who
    partake in day-to-day economic  and  social  activities  in  Kabul  are
    exposed to a risk of falling victim to the  generalised  violence  that
    affects the city.

22. The report states that in assessing whether Kabul provides a reasonable
    internal flight alternative it must be established  that  an  applicant
    would  have  access  to  shelter,  essential  services  and  livelihood
    opportunities.  There has been a significant population increase in the
    city.  Kabul city region has 5,000,000 residents, 60% of which  are  in
    the city in the wake of large scale returns to  Afghanistan  from  Iran
    and Pakistan.  In January 2017 it was reported that 55%  of  households
    in Kabul were severely food insecure.  It is on that basis  that  UNHCR
    considers  that  given  the  current   security,   human   rights   and
    humanitarian situation in Kabul an IFA/IRA is generally  not  available
    in the city. This is clearly  relevant  to  the  proportionality  of  a
    return, the question being not only what the appellant will leave  here
    but what he would be going to.

23. The evidence is that the appellant is regarded as an older  brother  to
    his uncle's children, is fully integrated into the UK, and has  pursued
    his studies here with diligence and success.  His formative years  have
    been here. He speaks English and is not dependent  financially  on  the
    State. The fact that he has been able  to  establish  himself  in  this
    position is at least in part due to the respondent's mishandling of his
    case at an earlier stage; if the Secretary of State  had  handled  this
    matter in the way it could reasonably have been expected  of  him,  the
    appellant would have been  granted  refugee  status  as  an  unattached
    child.

24. Whilst his private and family life have developed  when  his  situation
    here has been precarious and therefore should be  given  little  weight
    that does not mean no weight. In the light of the  above,  and  in  the
    context of the situation to  which  he  would  be  returning  in  Kabul
    without any family support I conclude that removal in this  case  would
    be disproportionate.

25. The appellant's appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
