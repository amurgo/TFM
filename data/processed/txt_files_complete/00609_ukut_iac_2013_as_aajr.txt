                                  JUDGMENT

Introduction

1.   This is an application for judicial review by the applicant, a  citizen
    of Afghanistan of a decision made by  the  defendant  on  17  May  2012
    assessing his date of birth as 4  September  1995  as  opposed  to  his
    claimed date of birth of 4 September 1997.  Permission was  granted  on
    12 November 2012 and the  application  was  transferred  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The issue for me is to carry out a fact-finding exercise  to
    determine the applicant's age.

The Evidence before the Tribunal

2.   I heard oral evidence from the applicant and his  cousin,  MS,  and  on
    behalf of the respondent, from two social  workers,  Rebecca  Faithfull
    and Sheila Johnson.  The documentary evidence is set out in  an  agreed
    bundle indexed and paginated A1-S215.  Tab A  contains  the  pleadings,
    court documents and  witness  statements,  Tab  B  the  age  assessment
    documents and the applicant's documents, Tab  C  the  party  and  party
    correspondence and Tab  S,  the  Social  Services  file.   I  was  also
    provided with  a  bundle  of  authorities  and  comprehensive  skeleton
    arguments from both counsel.

Background

3.    The  applicant  arrived  in  the  UK  on  5  December  2011  making  a
    clandestine entry by lorry.  In his first  witness  statement  at  (A53
    para 15) the applicant said that the journey took about two to two  and
    a half months and that he had been advised it was likely  that  he  had
    left Afghanistan in about October 2011 (A53).  After he got out of  the
    lorry, he looked for a policeman and was then taken to the Home  Office
    and there was a screening interview (B88-104) on  the  same  day.   The
    applicant claimed that he was 14� years old and that his date of  birth
    was 30 June 1997.   However,  in  a  further  statement  (B105-111)  in
    support of his asylum application he clarified  that  he  believed  his
    date of birth to be 13 June 1376 in the Afghan calendar; the  date  was
    recorded on his school register and his father had confirmed that  this
    was his date of birth when he left Afghanistan.

4.   On his way to the UK the agent asked his date  of  birth  and  he  told
    him.  He was told that the correct year was 1997 but the agent did  not
    translate the day and month and this led to him thinking that his  date
    of birth in the western calendar was 13 June 1997 whereas  the  correct
    date would be 4 September 1997.  An age assessment was carried  out  by
    the respondent on 16 December 2011 and the assessors concluded that the
    applicant was two years older than claimed, with a date of birth  of  4
    September  1995.   As  the  applicant  was   dissatisfied   with   this
    assessment, a letter before action was sent to the respondent which led
    to the offer of a second age assessment which took  place  on  5  April
    2012 and was completed on 3 May 2012.  In a decision dated 17 May  2012
    the assessors reached the same conclusion as in  the  first  assessment
    that the applicant was two years older than  claimed  with  a  date  of
    birth of 4 September 1995.

The Evidence of the Applicant

5.   The applicant's evidence is set out in two witness statements  dated  8
    August 2012 (A49-59) and 30 September  2013  (A60-67).   In  his  first
    statement he asserts that his date of birth in the Afghan  calendar  is
    13/06/1376 which he is informed converts to 04/09/1997 in  the  western
    calendar but his date of birth had been  partially  converted  by  some
    organisations as 13/06/1997 as in his medical records.  He was born  in
    a village in Afghanistan, Qala-e-Akhond, in  Kama  district,  Nangarhar
    province.  He has two younger siblings and when he  was  7  he  started
    attending a madrassa in his village to learn the Koran and when  8  the
    local primary school.  The applicant then says:

         "8.  My father gave the school my date of birth of 13/06/1376  when
             I was first registered at the school.  My father knew my exact
             date of birth.  Although my father had not received any formal
             education, he studied the Koran and he also had basic literacy
             and numeracy skills having  worked  in  a  shop  when  he  was
             younger.  I know my date of birth because my  father  gave  me
             this information and also I saw my date of birth recorded next
             to my name in the school register."


6.   The applicant went on to say that when he was 12  his  father  arranged
    for an Afghan identity document, a taskira.  It was issued in 1388  but
    he could not recall having his photograph taken  for  it.   His  father
    kept his taskira and his sister's in a safe place but he did  not  know
    exactly where they were located.  When he was just under 13 his  mother
    died following childbirth and the baby died a  couple  of  days  later.
    His sister stopped going to school after their mother died and  started
    to take care of the household chores.  His father had suffered a stroke
    about three years ago, was paralysed down one side and  had  to  use  a
    walking stick.  The applicant resumed year 6 at school but  was  forced
    to flee Afghanistan for his own safety because he was in  fear  of  the
    Taliban.  Arrangements were made for him to leave the  country  through
    an agent but he did not know how the trip was funded.  His father  made
    the arrangements.  The journey to the UK took about two to  two  and  a
    half months and he arrived on 5 December 2011.  He accepted that at the
    screening interview he gave his date of birth as 13/06/1997 as  it  had
    been wrongly converted by the agent.  At the first  age  assessment  he
    had also made a mistake when giving his date of birth as 13/06/1391  in
    the Afghan calendar rather than 1376.  The social workers had made  him
    feel nervous and he thought they were asking about the current year  in
    Afghanistan.


7.   In his second statement he confirmed that he has two cousins in the  UK
    and he had met one of them in Afghanistan, MS, who  lived  in  Thornton
    Heath.  He had seen him by chance in a mosque a few  months  previously
    and had been very happy to find him.  In the second age  assessment  it
    was said that he did not have any documents  to  support  his  date  of
    birth but his cousin had since given him his taskira.

8.   In his oral evidence he confirmed that he was upset at being  separated
    from his father and he did get upset when  his  family  was  mentioned.
    When he first came to the UK, he did not have any skills and his social
    worker had said to him that she would be like a mother to him and  look
    after him like a son.  He had wanted to be placed  with  a  family  but
    instead he had been given accommodation.

9.   In cross-examination he accepted he had been in  the  UK  now  for  two
    years.  He was at college.  He said that sometimes he got  confused  as
    he did not understand the lessons but he accepted that when he was well
    mentally, he was  able  to  do  good  work.   He  had  done  some  work
    experience at a restaurant where he had been sent by his key worker  so
    that he could learn to cook and the social workers had come to his home
    to teach him how to cook vegetables.  He was asked about  the  note  at
    S127 from 9 July 2013 confirming that he had grown in confidence in his
    cooking and his key worker had not seen  any  take-away  boxes  in  the
    house which was a good indicator for his  development.   The  applicant
    said that when he had take-aways, he now  binned  them  so  the  social
    worker did not see them.

10.  He explained that his life in Afghanistan had been  very  hard  as  his
    family was poor.  He described their home as a mud hut. When asked  how
    many rooms there were in his home, he said  he  did  not  remember  nor
    could  he  remember  his  father's  face.   The  house  did  not   have
    electricity and cooking was on a wood burning stove.  He accepted  that
    generally men did not cook in Afghanistan.  His  father  had  told  him
    that he had two cousins in London but he had only ever seen one cousin.
     Sometimes this cousin would telephone a shop in the village so that he
    could speak to the applicant's father.  The calls  were  about  once  a
    month and his father would simply mention that his cousin  had  called.
    His cousin had come to their home when his mother died  which  was  two
    years before he left Afghanistan.  It would have been  four  years  ago
    but he could not recall the season or the  weather.   His  cousin  came
    about one to two and a half months after his mother's  death.   It  was
    put to the applicant that he had said that his mother died  one  and  a
    half years before he arrived in the UK but he said he did not count the
    months and did not know this.

11.  He had had to leave Afghanistan because of  the  problems  he  had  had
    with the Taliban.  His father had handed him over to an agent.  He took
    him to Jalalabad, a 45 minute to one hour journey by taxi.  This was on
    the same evening that he had escaped from the Taliban.  He stayed in  a
    small room, the agent came in a vehicle and he was taken away.  He  did
    not see his father and the agent together.  When asked  about  what  he
    said at B52 about his father and the agent being together, he said that
    he had not himself seen them talking to each other.  When it was put to
    him that he was not telling the truth, he said that he was and that  he
    had had mental health problems.  He accepted that he had arrived in the
    UK in December 2011.  He could not remember the details  of  the  first
    age assessment.  He was not shaving at that time but had only  recently
    started.  He did not remember saying that he was shaving then.

12.  He had met his cousin, MS, in London recently.  He had been praying  in
    a mosque one Friday when he saw him there.  He  did  not  remember  how
    long ago this was save that it was a day off from college.  He did  not
    know when his cousin gave him the taskira, saying it might have been  a
    month ago, maybe more or less but he had no exact memory of  this.   He
    did not know how his cousin got the taskira as he does not discuss  his
    family with him because he gets upset.   He  did  not  know  where  his
    cousin's father lived.  He explained that when his father obtained  the
    taskira, they went to the district office in the province.  He did have
    a photograph taken and confirmed that the photograph on the taskira was
    his.  He said his father got proof from the school  about  how  old  he
    was.  He thought his father put his date of  birth  on  the  documents.
    His father had kept the taskira.  He confirmed that when he had started
    school his date of birth was written in the  school  register  and  his
    father had got a letter from the school.  He did remember his  date  of
    birth.  He had been told by the agent that if he gave his date of birth
    in Pashtu it would not be understood.  The agent said he would  convert
    it but he only did this for the year and not the  day  or  month.   The
    applicant explained that he was having counselling  from  Freedom  from
    Torture.   He  had  initially  attended  weekly  but  was   now   going
    fortnightly.  He would like to stay as long as possible in the UK.

The Evidence of MS

13.   MS is the applicant's cousin and his witness statement is  at  A68-70.
    He came to the UK as an asylum seeker on 18 December 2001.  He did  not
    know what his date of birth was but told the Home Office he was 15  and
    he was given a date of birth of 1 January 1976.  His claim was accepted
    and he was granted four years' leave to remain, then  indefinite  leave
    and is now a British  citizen.   His  father  is  the  brother  of  the
    applicant's father.  His own father now  lives  in  Pakistan  where  he
    moved about ten years ago.  He has visited him there a number of  times
    since living  in  the  UK  and  it  is  also  safe  for  him  to  visit
    Afghanistan.  He remembered  the  applicant  from  his  last  visit  to
    Afghanistan when he visited the family shortly after their mother died.
     He would say that the applicant was about 12 when he saw him then.

14.  He knew from his own father that the  applicant  had  left  Afghanistan
    for the UK but he had met him completely by chance in a mosque in south
    London this year.  He could not remember the date  but  it  would  have
    been in summer.  He had visited his own parents in Pakistan in 2012 and
    his father gave him some papers for the applicant that had  been  given
    to him by the applicant's father.  He did not know where the  applicant
    was but it was always his hope that he would find him and the documents
    were put away until a few weeks after he met  the  applicant.   He  had
    been told by his father that the applicant's father had visited him  in
    Pakistan and had given him the documents after the applicant  had  left
    Afghanistan.  The documents were the  original  taskira  and  a  letter
    about the Taliban.  He  had  passed  the  taskira  to  the  applicant's
    solicitors.

15.   In  his  oral  evidence  he  confirmed  that  he  had   travelled   to
    Afghanistan, flying to Pakistan and  then  travelling  by  car  or  bus
    across the border.  There was  no  entry  stamp  in  his  passport  for
    Afghanistan because on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan they
    were not really asked for passports.   His  visit  to  the  applicant's
    family in Afghanistan had been in 2009.  He confirmed from his  English
    and Afghan passports that he had visited Pakistan between  26  November
    2008 to 23 February 2009 and from 27  September  2009  to  15  February
    2010.  When he saw the applicant, he would have said he was  about  12.
    His mother had recently died and the applicant was playing  with  other
    children and although he understood his mother had  gone,  he  did  not
    seem very sad.  He had no reason to believe that  the  applicant  would
    have lied about his age to social workers at Croydon.

16.  In cross-examination he confirmed  that  it  had  been  2009  when  the
    applicant's mother had died, saying that this date was recorded on  her
    tombstone as having passed away in 2009, the  date  being  recorded  as
    such because most of their people spoke English.  He could not remember
    the season when he visited or the month but it was definitely 2009.  He
    was unable to describe the house or say how many rooms there were.   He
    described his uncle, the applicant's father, as an old man of 50 or 60.
     There was nothing special about him.  He was ill but not such that  he
    was dying.  He used to telephone his uncle maybe once or twice  a  year
    calling the local shop.  He had stopped contacting him  in  2011.   His
    uncle had come to his father's house  in  2011  and  left  some  papers
    there.  He was not able to contact his uncle and did not know where  he
    was and his own father said the same.  He had been given the  documents
    in 2011, not 2012.  He had met the  applicant  in  the  Croydon  mosque
    where he had been going for Friday prayers for about two years.  He saw
    him there two to three months ago and asked him to come to his home and
    then was able to give him the taskira.  The applicant had told him that
    there was an age dispute.

17.  In re-examination he said that he  had  been  nervous  giving  evidence
    because it was the first time he had  given  evidence  in  a  court  or
    Tribunal and although he had not used an interpreter, his  English  was
    not very good.

The Evidence of Rebecca Faithfull


18.  Ms Faithfull's witness statement is at A71-74.  She confirmed that  she
    is a qualified social  worker  registered  with  the  Health  and  Care
    Professionals Council on 30 November 2012.  She has  been  employed  by
    the respondent since November 2012  and  was  currently  based  in  the
    Permanence 2 Team in the Looked  after  Children's  Service.   She  had
    previously been on a student placement in the Unaccompanied Minors Team
    from December 2011 to May  2012  and  during  this  time  she  was  the
    allocated social worker for the applicant from 31 January 2012 to 9 May
    2012.  She had met with him nine times during the course of her duties.
     She described the applicant as a  quiet  young  person  who  displayed
    maturity in his social interactions above that of a 14  year  old  boy.
    He had needed support with developing  his  independent  living  skills
    such as cooking and keeping his flat clean and tidy.  At the  time  she
    worked with the applicant, she was aware that he had been  assessed  to
    be 16 years of age and that he was disputing this.   It  was  her  view
    that his age had been appropriately assessed by the respondent.  He had
    a good relationship with his key worker who felt  he  assimilated  well
    into semi-independent living successfully.  She believed him to  be  16
    when she was working with him because of a combination of his  physical
    appearance and his demeanour.  She had the  sense  of  working  with  a
    young man rather than a boy.

19.   In  cross-examination  Ms  Faithfull  confirmed  that  she  was  still
    employed by Croydon and that she had qualified in 2012 and so  was  not
    fully qualified when supervising the  applicant.   She  was  unable  to
    recall the frequency of the visits but they were usually for a  minimum
    of an hour but could on occasions have been shorter.  She was  referred
    to the note at S20 and accepted that this referred to  a  pathway  plan
    which her manager was not happy with and wanted her to amend.  She  was
    taken through the notes of her contact with the applicant and confirmed
    that there was  no  specific  observation  about  his  behaviour  being
    mature.  The applicant had told her about his past experiences and  how
    he was feeling to some  extent.   She  did  not  know  whether  he  was
    suppressing his fears but he had had other  professionals  to  talk  to
    about this.  The applicant had always engaged well both  with  her  and
    his key worker.  She would expect a person of a younger age not to have
    managed.   Her  view  about  the  applicant's  age  was  based  on  her
    observations and how he interacted with her.  The applicant was a quiet
    person but he was competent enough to ask for things and did  not  look
    either up or down at her.  She felt he was mature  beyond  his  claimed
    age.

20.  When he arrived he did not  have  any  independent  living  skills  and
    there was no suggestion that he had those  skills  before  he  arrived.
    She described him as a fairly quick learner who developed  skills  over
    the three months she was working with him.  He had been placed  by  the
    respondent in semi-independent accommodation.  She  accepted  that  the
    development of skills was not necessarily an  indication  of  maturity.
    The applicant had said he  suffered  from  nightmares,  had  difficulty
    sleeping and had some mental health problems.  She accepted there might
    be a possible link between these and his age but there was no necessary
    correlation and that it  was  difficult  to  judge  age  from  physical
    appearance but it was still her  view  that  his  appearance  was  more
    consistent with being 16 rather than 14.  It was not impossible that he
    had been 14 but her opinion was that he was more likely to be 16.

21.  In re-examination she said that she  had  not  given  evidence  before.
    She had drafted maybe four pathway plans and was not aware of criticism
    of them.   She had worked with other young  people.   When  responsible
    for the applicant, she had had about eight to twelve cases.

The Evidence of Sheila Johnson

22.  Ms Johnson's witness  statement  is  set  out  at  A75-79.   She  is  a
    qualified social worker and prior to working  for  the  respondent  had
    worked for Barnardos for nine years.   She  was  the  allocated  social
    worker for the applicant for five months from April to September  2013.
    She met with him on four occasions (correcting line 1 of para 6 of  her
    statement which referred to five occasions).   She  believed  that  the
    applicant had been appropriately age assessed and was not as  young  as
    he claimed.  Based on her interactions and observing him interact  with
    other professionals and young people, she felt he presented as  someone
    who was at least 18 years old.  On  occasions  when  he  requested  her
    support with college and on issues relating to finance he  came  across
    as quite demanding, telling her what she should do and how  she  should
    support him.  He was a confident young man who was able to  look  after
    himself and kept his living space to a good level without the support a
    younger person would require.

23.  In her oral evidence she said that she thought  the  applicant  was  18
    but possibly older.  She took this from the way he looked  and  how  he
    presented.  He did not need a lot of support and was able to  verbalise
    quite confidently.  She said he could be between 18  and  21.   He  had
    told her that he was entitled to his Eid money and would chase her on a
    daily basis.  There had been an occasion where he had been issued  with
    an �80 fine for travelling without the appropriate ticket on  the  tram
    and he had chased her up about whether the respondent would be  paying.



24.  In cross-examination she confirmed that she had qualified as  a  social
    worker in 2005.  She had met the applicant on four  occasions,  two  at
    his placement, once for his LAC review and once to discuss the  pathway
    plan.  She had not met him with his peers.  She accepted  that  at  S26
    she had used the phrase "becoming mature" as he was still developing as
    a young man.  She was referred to S28 about the  applicant  losing  his
    oyster card, S30 about being tearful and anxious in  the  mornings  and
    S35 as having forgotten  a  visit  and  asked  whether  this  would  be
    expected from a child.  She said that  this  was  not  necessarily  the
    case; it could be expected from anybody, perhaps a young person.   When
    dealing with the Eid money, this had not been  sent  to  the  applicant
    when he expected it and she had to explain to him that  it  had  to  go
    through a process and that  it  would  take  two  weeks  but  still  he
    constantly pestered her because he was impatient to receive the  money.
    She was asked whether this was more a characteristic of a child than  a
    young person.  She accepted this to a degree but she would not say that
    he was immature and it could be a sign of a lack of understanding.

25.  She thought that the respondent had done the best  it  could  and  that
    his key worker had done a good job.  It was not surprising that he  had
    developed the skills he had.  When using  public  transport,  initially
    the applicant would have been escorted but he was encouraged to use  it
    as a part of becoming independent.  She accepted that some  boys  could
    look older than their true  age.   She  stood  by  her  view  that  the
    applicant looked over 18 and she did not accept that it was not  beyond
    possibility that he was 16.

26.  On re-examination she explained  that  in  her  previous  work  in  the
    Leaving Care Team she had been  involved  with  30  young  people  from
    Afghanistan, all over 18.

Submissions for the Respondent

27.  Ms Cooper reminded me that the Tribunal's task  was  to  determine  the
    applicant's age and to do so by  taking  essentially  an  inquisitorial
    role with neither party bearing a burden of  proof.   The  respondent's
    social workers were tasked  with  doing  their  best.   They  were  not
    lawyers but were truly independent with their professional  duty  being
    to the young person.  She confirmed that the conclusions reached in the
    first age assessment were not reliable but it stood as a record of  the
    account given by the applicant at that time.  Reliance  was  placed  on
    the report of the second assessment at B12  and  the  accuracy  of  the
    record could be verified from the notes kept  by  the  applicant's  own
    legal representative at B35-55.

28.  The respondent relied on the evidence of the two social workers  called
    who had spent longer periods with the applicant and were able to  refer
    to the notes  that  had  been  made.   Whilst  Ms  Faithful  was  newly
    qualified as a social worker and may have been very nervous  in  giving
    evidence, she had given her  opinion  about  the  applicant's  age  and
    believed that the age assessment was correct.  Ms Johnson was extremely
    experienced and weight should be given to her evidence.  She  submitted
    that  the  applicant  had  not  been  a  reliable  witness   and   when
    inconsistencies were put, he had changed his story.  There  were  clear
    discrepancies about the frequency of phone calls by the cousin  to  his
    father, on the evidence about his father taking him to meet  the  agent
    in Jalalabad and whether he had seen his father with the agent  or  had
    heard him speak, about the date of his mother's  death,  the  applicant
    had previously been clear that it was one and a half  years  before  he
    left but in his oral evidence said that it was two years before.

29.  She submitted that other aspects of his evidence were  implausible:  he
    could not remember the number of rooms in his house  and  his  evidence
    was of no help in assessing when his cousin visited him.   However,  he
    had been able to remember his date of birth on the basis  that  he  had
    seen it recorded at school.  He had said during the age assessment that
    his age was on the taskira but  this  was  not  the  case  and  he  had
    accepted that he had been wrong about that.  His evidence was that  his
    father had taken a letter from the school  referring  to  the  date  of
    birth but if it had been  shown  to  the  official,  it  had  not  been
    recorded but the age had been given relying on appearance.

30.  The applicant's assessed age was consistent with the  progress  he  was
    making at college and with the increasing level of his  skills.   There
    was evidence that he had been receiving counselling  and  there  was  a
    report from Freedom from Torture (B75-76) but that report  was  clearly
    compiled from what the applicant had said and  was  at  odds  with  the
    evidence and observations of other  people.   She  submitted  that  the
    observations of the key workers were reliable and these were consistent
    with a young man growing into adulthood.

31.  Ms Cooper submitted that the cousin's evidence was  not  reliable.   He
    had been unable to give any details about his visits to the applicant's
    family home in 2009 and his evidence about the frequency of phone calls
    contrasted with that given by the applicant.  He had said  the  purpose
    of the calls was to ask about the health of the applicant's father  but
    he was unable to give any further details about that.  She submitted it
    was not credible that nothing had been discussed between the  applicant
    and his cousin about the age assessment and  the  account  of  how  the
    taskira was obtained was not plausible.  It was said that the  cousin's
    father had obtained the documents in 2011 from the applicant's  father.
    If so,  this  was  difficult  to  square  with  the  applicant  leaving
    Afghanistan in October 2011.  His father must have set off to travel to
    Pakistan  within  weeks  of  the  applicant  leaving   and   in   these
    circumstances it was difficult to understand why he had not  taken  the
    applicant to his brother in Pakistan.  In summary, the evidence  showed
    that the applicant was a capable young man living an  independent  life
    now with little support.  He had accepted  one  of  his  goals  was  to
    remain in the UK and not to go back to Afghanistan and  he  would  know
    that giving himself a younger age would help him in this respect.   She
    submitted his most  likely  date  of  birth  was  as  assessed  by  the
    respondent.

Submissions for the Applicant

32.  Mr Suterwalla submitted firstly that the age assessment relied  on  was
    not reliable as provisional adverse findings had not been  put  to  the
    applicant and there was no adequate evidence that  the  social  workers
    had been properly trained or that the  required  procedural  safeguards
    were in place.  In any event  the  Tribunal  should  not  automatically
    defer to the views of the social workers which were simply  matters  to
    be taken into account.  The credibility of the applicant's account  was
    an issue of considerable importance.  He submitted that  the  applicant
    had been co-operative and straightforward in  his  evidence  giving  no
    hint that he was trying to deceive.  Giving evidence about age could be
    confusing especially when it was repeated on a number of occasions.  It
    was said that the applicant was vague in his answers but he should  not
    be faulted for saying that he could not recollect something  when  that
    may well be the case as opposed to trying to hide something.  A  number
    of aspects of his evidence had not been challenged in cross-examination
    at the hearing such as the length of his journey and the years when  he
    was at school.  He said he  had  completed  five  years  of  schooling,
    having started school at 8.

33.  It had  been  argued  that  parts  of  the  applicant's  evidence  were
    inconsistent but when at the first age  assessment  the  applicant  had
    given his date of birth as 1390 or 1391, the answer was clearly bizarre
    as 1390 was equivalent to 2011 and such an answer would simply  reflect
    nervousness rather than lying.  So far as what he had said about  being
    handed over to the agent, it was entirely plausible  that  he  did  not
    himself see the agent and his father talking; there was no  reason  why
    he should lie about this matter.  It had not been put to the  applicant
    that he was lying about how  his  taskira  had  been  obtained  and  no
    adverse inference should be drawn from his account about  the  taskira.
    He submitted that looking at the evidence in the round and focusing  on
    the significant issues, the applicant had  been  consistent  about  his
    family, its composition, his activities in Afghanistan, why he had left
    and about his life in  the  UK.   There  was  nothing  strange  in  him
    recalling his date of birth since being enrolled in school.

34.  So far as the evidence of his cousin was  concerned,  it  was  accepted
    that he came across as a very nervous witness but  this  did  not  mean
    that he was not telling the truth.  He had not exaggerated his position
    only claiming to have seen the applicant for one night during  a  short
    visit to Afghanistan.  Similarly, he had not exaggerated  his  evidence
    about why he thought the applicant had been 12 when he saw him.  He had
    made visits to Pakistan in 2009 and it was clear that he  believed  the
    visit to Afghanistan was in the spring.  There was no inconsistency  in
    his description  of  the  applicant's  home  with  that  given  by  the
    applicant and his account of  how  he  met  him  in  this  country  was
    consistent with the applicant's own account.

35.  He accepted that the taskira could not be regarded as  decisive  as  it
    recorded that his age of 12 in 2009/2010 was based on  his  appearance.
    Nonetheless, this document clearly supported the applicant's account of
    his age because he always said he had a  taskira  which  had  now  been
    produced and he had explained that his father went with him  to  obtain
    it with a letter from the school with his date of birth on it.

36.  Mr Suterwalla submitted that little weight should be  attached  to  the
    age assessments.  Neither assessment was signed off  by  the  assessors
    and no oral evidence  had  been  called  by  those  who  had  made  the
    assessments.  Further, the second age assessment was flawed in that  it
    was clear that the overriding reasons for the assessment were  how  the
    applicant physically presented, the fact  that  he  did  not  show  any
    evident signs of emotion and was unable to give details about the  date
    he left Afghanistan or the countries  he  travelled  through.   It  was
    common knowledge that dates and times did not have the same  importance
    in Afghanistan as in the  West.   No  explanation  was  given  for  the
    assessors relying on the claimant's  "level  of  cognitive  development
    demonstrated by his ability to grasp and  process  information".   They
    claimed they had applied the benefit of the  doubt  but  this  was  not
    explained.  There had  been  no  analysis  of  the  applicant's  actual
    account of his age and how he came to know it.

37.  He submitted that the evidence from Ms Faithfull  and  Ms  Johnson  was
    unconvincing.   Ms  Faithfull  had  accepted  that  her  evidence   was
    essentially that the applicant was older than he claimed because he had
    coped well in his semi-independent placement  and  the  record  of  her
    meetings with him did  not  support  her  assessment  that  he  behaved
    maturely in his interactions with others.   The  evidence  showed  that
    after  a  period  of  adjustment  the  applicant  had  coped  in  semi-
    independent placement  but  that  he  submitted  was  not  evidence  of
    maturity.  Ms Johnson said that it was impossible that he could present
    as 16 but she had not spent a lot of time with him.  The fact  that  he
    coped well in his placement did not say anything about maturity and his
    physical appearance could not be given any great weight.   In  summary,
    he submitted that there was no  compelling  evidence  to  dislodge  the
    applicant's own account of his age which in the light of  the  evidence
    as a whole should be confirmed as his true age.

The Law

38.  There is no issue between the parties on the law to be applied.   In  R
    (A) v London Borough of Croydon [2009] UKSC 8 the  Supreme  Court  held
    that in cases involving the exercise of a local  authority's  statutory
    obligations in respect of children, a child's age was a matter  subject
    to determination by  the  court  as  a  precedent  fact.   Neither  the
    applicant nor the respondent bear a burden of proof but it is  for  the
    Tribunal to enquire and on the basis of the evidence produced to make a
    decision on a balance of probabilities.

Evaluation of the Evidence and Assessment of the Issues

39.  I now turn to my assessment of  the  evidence.   It  is  common  ground
    between counsel that this involves the consideration of the  following:
    (1) the applicant's account, (2) the evidence of his cousin MS, (3) the
    weight to be placed on the taskira produced in evidence, (4) the weight
    to be placed on the two age assessments,  and  (5)  the  weight  to  be
    placed on the evidence of the social workers, all  the  evidence  being
    assessed in the context of the evidence as a whole.

40.  It is not in dispute that the applicant is  a  citizen  of  Afghanistan
    who arrived in the UK  on  5  December  2011  and  immediately  claimed
    asylum.  He claims that his date of birth is 4 September  1997  whereas
    the respondent has assessed his age as two years older with a  date  of
    birth of 4 September 1995.   This  is  a  case  where  the  applicant's
    credibility is of considerable importance.   I  remind  myself  of  the
    guidance given by Stanley Burnton J in R (B) v London Borough of Merton
    [2003] 4 All ER 280 where he said at [28]:

         "Given the impossibility of any decision maker being able  to  make
         an objectively verifiable determination of the age of an  applicant
         who may be in the age range of, say, 16 to 20, it is  necessary  to
         take a history from him or her with a view to  determining  whether
         it is true.  A history that is accepted as true and  is  consistent
         with an age below 18 will enable the decision maker in such a  case
         to decide that the applicant is a child.  Conversely,  however,  an
         untrue history while relevant is not necessarily  indicative  of  a
         lie as to the age of the applicant.  Lies may be told  for  reasons
         unconnected with the applicant's case as to his age, for example to
         avoid return to  his  country  of  origin.   Furthermore,  physical
         appearance and behaviour cannot be isolated from  the  question  of
         the veracity  of  the  applicant:  appearance,  behaviour  and  the
         credibility of his account are all matters  that  reflect  on  each
         other."


41.  The applicant has maintained since his arrival that his year  of  birth
    is 1997. In the screening interview he initially claimed  that  he  was
    14� years old giving a date of birth as 13-06-97.   He  explained  this
    further in  his  statement  of  5  January  2012  that  his  agent  had
    translated the year into the western calendar but not the day and month
    and that the correct date in  the  West  would  be  4  September  1997.
    Subsequently, he has been consistent in this assertion.  I do not  draw
    any adverse inference from the fact that at the first age assessment he
    gave a date of birth as 13/06/1391  as  2011  is  1390  in  the  Afghan
    calendar and the year 1391 had not been reached  at  that  stage.   The
    date was plainly wrong and may well have arisen from either  nerves  or
    confusion.  However, I have more difficulty with his explanation  about
    why he had initially said that his date of birth  was  13/06/1997.   He
    knew that his birth date was being put into the western  calendar  from
    1376 and it seems unlikely that  the  agent  would  not  have  made  an
    accurate conversion rather than simply translating the year.

42.  The applicant's claim is that he knows his date of  birth,  unlike  his
    cousin in the UK who in his evidence said that this would generally  be
    unusual for someone in  Afghanistan.   The  basis  of  the  applicant's
    knowledge was that his father had told him his date of birth and it was
    recorded when he was first registered at his school.  He also relies on
    the evidence of his cousin who assessed his age at  about  12  when  he
    visited in 2009 and on the taskira which has been produced in evidence.

43.  Dealing generally with the applicant's evidence, there are a number  of
    aspects which give rise to concern.  When  asked  in  cross-examination
    about his home in Afghanistan he simply described it as  a  mud  house.
    He was unable to say how many rooms there were.  His evidence about his
    cousin's claimed visit was also very vague.  He said in evidence it was
    about one to two and a half months after his mother died but  he  could
    not recall the season or the weather.  He was  unable  to  explain  the
    contradiction with his written evidence that his mother died one and  a
    half years before he came to the UK.  So far as his cousin's  telephone
    calls are concerned his evidence  gave  the  impression  of  relatively
    regular calls about once a month and his father would tell him that his
    cousin had called.  This contradicted the evidence from his cousin  who
    said that he may have called infrequently about once a year.

44.  When describing his departure from his home village and  travelling  to
    Jalalabad to be put in the hands of the agent, he said that this was on
    the same evening that he escaped from the Taliban.  In the  information
    he gave at the second age assessment he said that his father handed him
    to the shopkeeper and that he was still present when the agent arrived.
     However, in his oral evidence he said that he did not  see  the  agent
    and his father together and when this was queried he said that although
    he did not see them himself, he heard them talking together.

45.  I also had difficulty with the applicant's evidence about when  he  met
    his cousin in this country.  The applicant arrived in December 2011 but
    he did not meet his cousin  until,  on  his  account,  by  chance  when
    praying at a mosque in about  July  2013.   There  had  been  telephone
    contact between the cousin and the applicant's father and according  to
    the evidence of both the applicant and the cousin he paid  a  visit  in
    2009 following the death of the applicant's mother.  If the applicant's
    age is as claimed at the age of 14 he was entrusted  to  an  agent  who
    brought him to the UK where he has two cousins and  yet  the  applicant
    appeared to have had no means of contacting them and they only  met  by
    chance, and a happy chance, as the cousin had collected some  documents
    when he visited his father in Pakistan in 2011, these having been  left
    by the  applicant's  father  who  had  travelled  from  Afghanistan  to
    Pakistan.

46.  I have heard evidence about the applicant's ability to  cope  with  his
    semi-independent living.  I accept that the applicant  arrived  without
    such skills and that he has developed them.  I  find  that  during  his
    evidence he tended to  downplay  his  abilities.   I  have  taken  into
    account the Freedom from Torture Report which paints a  very  different
    picture from that in  the  respondent's  case  notes  but  this  report
    inevitably depends upon what the applicant has told the counsellor.

47.  None of the concerns I have identified in the applicant's evidence  are
    in themselves determinative  but  when  they  are  taken  cumulatively,
    particularly when taken with the view I have formed about the  cousin's
    evidence  and  the  reliability  of  the  taskira,  I  find  that   the
    applicant's evidence about his age is neither credible nor reliable.

48.  I now  turn  to  the  evidence  of  the  applicant's  cousin.   It  was
    submitted that he was clearly very nervous in giving his evidence.   He
    said so at the end of his evidence, saying  this  was  because  he  had
    never given evidence before and was giving evidence in English.  On his
    account he paid a visit to the applicant's home in early 2009  when  he
    would have been about 33.  He was unable to give any details about  the
    home or when he visited save in the most general terms  that  it  would
    have been in 2009 during his November 2008 -  February  2009  visit  to
    Pakistan.  He accepted that there had been infrequent telephone  calls,
    the purpose to ask about the health of the applicant's  father  but  he
    was unable to say anything  about  him  when  asked  in  evidence.   He
    maintained that he had received the documents from his  own  father  in
    2011 which he brought to the UK.  He had held on to them until  contact
    was renewed between him and his cousin in 2013 and he was then able  to
    give them to him.  I found MS's evidence to be  wholly  implausible  on
    the issues relevant to the applicant's age.  The fact that evidence  is
    implausible does not mean it is not credible but the cumulative  effect
    of the matters I have set out lead me to the finding that his  evidence
    is not credible but has been tailored to support  the  applicant  in  a
    false claim about his age.

49.  I now turn to the taskira which is at A66 and A67.  The  applicant  has
    maintained that he knew his date of birth as did his father.   He  says
    that this document was obtained in 2009/10 when his age was assessed at
    12.  This document provides for the recording of the date of birth  and
    age and in circumstances where it is said that  his  father  knew  that
    date and took a letter from the school to confirm it, it  is  odd  that
    the taskira reads "based on his appearance, his age was  determined  to
    be 12 years in 1388" and makes no reference to the actual date.  I also
    note that although a photograph  has  been  attached  to  the  taskira,
    nothing has been entered under "distinguishing  signs".   I  also  take
    into account the fact that the applicant initially maintained that  his
    actual date of birth appeared on this document when this  was  not  the
    case.  I am also concerned about the provenance of the document and the
    way in which it has been obtained.  As I  have  already  set  out,  the
    applicant's case is that he received  this  document  from  his  cousin
    quite recently who had been keeping this and another document about the
    Taliban at his home having been given it by his father in  Pakistan  in
    2011.  In summary, I am not satisfied that the taskira  is  a  reliable
    document.

50.  I now turn to the question of  the  age  assessments.   The  respondent
    does not seek to rely on the first age assessment save in so far as  it
    records what was said at the time.  Reliance is placed  on  the  second
    assessment but when considering the weight to be given  to  it  I  take
    into account the points made by Mr Suterwalla that the assessment  does
    not appear to have been signed off by the assessors who were not called
    to give oral evidence in any event.  Further concerns arise about  this
    assessment in the light of the apparent reliance  based  upon  them  on
    social  interaction  and  maturity  assessed  in  a  relatively   short
    interview.

51.  Finally, I turn to the evidence from the social workers,  Ms  Faithfull
    and Ms  Johnson.   It  is  argued  that  Ms  Faithfull's  evidence  was
    unconvincing in that essentially she was relying on the fact  that  the
    applicant had coped well in semi-independent  placement  and  that  she
    regarded him as mature.  Ms Faithfull has only recently fully qualified
    as a social worker and to that extent is still gaining  in  experience.
    She was asked in particular about a  pathway  plan  which  her  manager
    found unsatisfactory and required amendments  but  I  draw  no  adverse
    inference from this  about  her  competence  or  her  views  about  the
    applicant's age.  She said in her statement that prior to qualifying as
    a social worker she was a youth worker with the Youth  Service  of  the
    London Borough of Merton with young people aged 14 to 18, worked with a
    school as a learning support  assistant  with  children  with  learning
    difficulties from 11 to 16, as a key worker in the homeless section  of
    Centrepoint for two years with young people aged 16 to  25  of  various
    ethnicities and had also taught children aged 5 to 18  in  Nepal.   She
    was the applicant's social worker for three months from 31 January 2012
    to 9 May 2012.  If his claimed birth of 1997 was correct, he would have
    been 14 at that stage.  It was Ms Faithfull's view  that  he  displayed
    maturity in his social actions above that of a 14 year old boy.  In her
    evidence she was taken through the records of the various meetings  she
    had had with the applicant and agreed  that  they  had  not  explicitly
    referred to the applicant as mature.  However, when those  reports  are
    read as a whole, they do show that he coped well with  semi-independent
    living and with adjusting to life in Croydon following a very different
    life in Afghanistan.

52.  So far as Ms Johnson is concerned she  is  a  more  experienced  social
    worker having qualified in 2005.  She was the applicant's social worker
    between April and September 2013, meeting with him on  four  occasions.
    Her view was very clear that he was 18 and  could  possibly  be  older.
    She has had considerable experience of working  with  children,  having
    worked with Barnardos for nine years before joining Croydon.  She  felt
    he presented as someone who was at least 18 years old.  She pointed  to
    the fact that he was able to make it very  clear  what  he  wanted  and
    could be persistent evidencing his pursuit of her over  his  money  for
    Eid and about paying his penalty for travelling on the tram  without  a
    ticket.

53.  I am satisfied  that  both  Ms  Faithfull  and  Ms  Johnson  have  been
    entirely professional in their approach  to  their  dealings  with  the
    applicant and have not been  influenced  by  the  fact  that  they  are
    employed  by  the  respondent  local  authority  which  made  the   age
    assessment.  I am  satisfied  that  they  have  both  given  an  honest
    assessment of their view about  the  applicant's  age  based  on  their
    experience of working with  the  applicant  and  generally  with  young
    people. I attach considerable weight to their opinions.

54.  In summary, for the reasons I have given, I do not find  the  applicant
    or his cousin to be reliable or credible witnesses about his age nor do
    I find that the taskira is a reliable document on which any weight  can
    be placed.  When reaching this decision I have taken into  account  the
    positive comments made about the applicant  in  the  papers.   His  key
    worker speaks highly of him as do his college lecturers.  One describes
    him as having a very respectful attitude and as very committed  to  his
    studies and the other as  an  intelligent,  hardworking  and  extremely
    pleasant young man who is always polite, co-operative  and  willing  to
    learn despite his mental health problems caused by his  post  traumatic
    stress disorder.  I have taken into account the letter from the Freedom
    from Torture but as I have already commented, much of what is  set  out
    there contradicts the respondent's notes about how he  has  coped  with
    semi-independent living.

55.  I accept that there are criticisms which can be made of the second  age
    assessment but when I take into account the evidence  of  Ms  Faithfull
    and Ms Johnson, in the light of the records  in  the  Social  Services'
    file, I am satisfied that the applicant is older than he claims, and by
    a reasonably significant margin.  Ms Johnson clearly believes  that  he
    may well be older than 18.  Nonetheless I am not satisfied there is any
    proper basis for finding that the  applicant  is  older  than  the  age
    assessed by the respondent and I find that his probable date  of  birth
    is 4 September 1995.

Decision

56.  I therefore find on a balance of  probabilities  that  the  applicant's
    date of birth is 4 September 1995 and I make a declaration accordingly.



57.  The applicant is to pay the respondent's costs on the  standard  basis.
    As the applicant has the benefit of public funding no further action is
    to be taken until an assessment is  made  of  his  ability  to  pay  in
    accordance with s.11(1) of the Access to Justice Act  1999,  directions
    in respect of which are to stand adjourned generally to be restored  on
    the written request of the respondent.

58.  There is to be  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  applicant's  publicly
    funded costs in accordance with the Community Legal  Service  (Funding)
    Order 2000.
