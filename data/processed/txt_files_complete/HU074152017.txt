Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Whilst no anonymity direction was made earlier in the  proceedings,  we  now
make an anonymity direction because the case involves a  child.  Unless  and
until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is  granted
anonymity. No report of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family. This  direction  applies  both  to
the appellant and to the respondent.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr � Ceallaigh, Counsel, instructed by Wilsons
Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, born January 1964, is a citizen of Jamaica  who  appeals
    against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal of  31  October  2018  to
    refuse his appeal against a decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    deport him as a foreign criminal.

 2. The appellant has a lengthy immigration history since he entered the UK
    in 1997.

 3. On 30 October 2008 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 8  years  on  a
    charge of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily  harm  at  Croydon
    Crown Court.

 4. On  9  March  2009  he  was  sentenced  to  a  concurrent  sentence  of
    imprisonment for 4 years for  supplying  the  class  A  drugs,  heroin,
    cocaine and crack cocaine.

 5. Since he was released from his prison sentence in 2012,  the  Secretary
    of State has sought to deport the appellant on the basis that he  is  a
    foreign criminal within the meaning of UK Borders Act 2007  section  32
    and liable to automatic deportation. Following  his  release  from  his
    sentence, the appellant was detained under immigration laws until being
    released on 2 October 2015.

History relevant to these proceedings

 6. The appellant has a son G born in October 2007 by a former partner from
    whom he is estranged. He had contact with the child in  prison  between
    2009 and 2012 until his relationship with  the  child's  mother  ended.
    There seems to have been a significant  gap  before  telephone  contact
    between the appellant and G commenced in February 2014.  In  a  CAFCASS
    report, Ms Julia Solly, a family court adviser, reported that this  was
    a positive experience for G and that the appellant may be something  of
    a protective factor where there may be some basis to his concerns as to
    G's parenting by his mother.

 7. Care concerns about G with his mother were identified in December  2013
    and in 2014 which included an allegation that G had been  assaulted  by
    his mother who acknowledged that she was struggling to cope. There  had
    been a report that she had been assaulted by X, the father of her other
    son  L.  X  had  a  drug  problem  and  was  subject  to  a   community
    rehabilitation programme. G may have reported being  physically  abused
    by X in 2011. Police had been involved in relation to allegations about
    X on seven occasions between June 2009 and  May  2013,  most  of  which
    involved him turning up unexpectedly at G's mother's house. On  one  of
    those occasions he had seriously assaulted her.

 8. On 15 March 2016 his probation officer reported that the appellant  had
    complied with licence conditions and was  now  assessed  to  present  a
    medium risk of harm to known adults and the public but a  low  risk  to
    children.

 9. On 30 March 2016 the appellant commenced supervised  contact  with  his
    son and by October 2016 he had  unsupported  contact  for  up  to  four
    hours.

10. On 19 October 2016 the Family Court at Aldershot  and  Farnham  ordered
    that the appellant should have contact with G and they have  since  had
    frequent and substantial contact.

11. On 17 January 2017 the Family Court made  a  final  order  and  in  the
    course  of  his  judgment,  District  Judge  James  recorded  that  the
    appellant has a genuine interest in having a relationship with his  son
    which was his primary motivation; G had formed a real attachment to his
    father and wanted to have contact with him; the appellant had G's  best
    interests at heart and had been said by Ms Solly  to  be  a  protective
    factor; it was important that G is of dual  heritage  and  it  was  the
    appellant who could introduce him to Caribbean culture.

12. Judge James ordered that the judgment be disclosed in  the  immigration
    proceedings, the Secretary of State having  notified  interest  in  the
    family proceedings. In his order the judge recorded that it is  in  G's
    best interests to have direct contact with his father; this  would  not
    happen if the appellant is deported and would  be  emotionally  harmful
    for G; the probation service consider the appellant to pose no risk  to
    G and his application for contact had not  been  brought  to  delay  or
    frustrate his removal from the UK.

13. Similar conclusions to those recorded in the preceding paragraphs  were
    reached by an independent social worker in a report of 28  August  2018
    which was before the FtTJ.

14. On 21 August 2018 G was diagnosed with ASD traits, ADD and dyslexia.

15. An independent psychological  risk  assessment  of  11  September  2018
    concluded  that  the  appellant  is  at  low  risk  of  future  violent
    offending.

The determination of 31 October 2018

16. The circumstances described above were before the FtTJ  who  refers  to
    the points founded on by the appellant in his determination.  The  FtTJ
    records at para 20 that  the  appellant  is  concerned  for  his  son's
    welfare including whether he was being fed properly, and  is  alert  to
    the problems his former partner had had with X.  Whilst  the  appellant
    has ten other children who now live in Canada, USA, Jamaica and the UK,
    his relationship with G is different because he needs to be near him to
    make sure that he is safe and well. He would go back to Jamaica  if  it
    were not for G (paras 21 and 22).

17. The FtTJ noted part of the Family Court's reasoning in para 27  of  the
    determination: contact might be appropriate to allow the child  to  get
    to know his father for what might prove to  be  a  short  period  after
    which the relationship may be cemented in the future with the potential
    to maintain contact by telephone and Skype.

18. At para 37 the FtTJ noted that Mr � Ceallaigh submitted that G's safety
    was the core of the appeal and an exceptional consideration  such  that
    deportation should not be permitted.

19. At para 41 the FtTJ noted that G is now aged 10  and  living  with  his
    mother  in  circumstances  which  had  not  led  to   social   services
    intervening  by  putting  him  in  care  or  introducing  any  specific
    supervision.

20. At para 42 the FtTJ considered whether enforced separation would be not
    just unduly harsh  but  would  actively  place  G  in  harm's  way.  He
    concluded that: "G's home life may  not  be  ideal  but  there  are  no
    immediate and obvious risk factors."

21. At para 43 he noted that the appellant's living  conditions  were  such
    that there was no prospect that G would live with him so he  will  live
    with his mother.

22. Para 44 includes the following:

         "... Aside from his difficulties and the consequences of his father
         being overseas and therefore not being able to see him on a regular
         basis, there is nothing else which is critical to  this  case  that
         makes the father's removal undesirable. If he is  really  concerned
         about his child's welfare, he  can  continue  to  make  contact  by
         writing and/or through Skype calls, and if there is any obstruction
         on the part of his child's mother, then he can complain  to  Social
         Services who would undoubtedly take steps to remedy that."

23. At para 44 the FtTJ explained that he found nothing amounting  to  very
    compelling circumstances against  a  very  strong  public  interest  in
    deportation for serious offending.

The challenge

24. There are three grounds of appeal:

        . In ground 1 the appellant contends that the FtTJ erred in finding
          that there were not risk factors bearing on the  appellant's  son
          on the basis that there was no social work intervention  in  that
          regard.

        . The contention in ground 2  is  that  the  FtTJ  failed  to  take
          account of the significance of the appellant's son being of mixed-
          race with the implication that he would lose access  to  part  of
          his heritage on the appellant's deportation.

        . Ground 3 proposes an error in finding that  the  appellant  could
          secure  protection  of  his  son  via  Skype  communication  from
          Jamaica.

Submissions for the appellant

25. In a lengthy skeleton argument which is essentially the  same  as  that
    before the FtT, Mr � Ceallaigh summarised the facts of  the  case  from
    the appellant's perspective, making the same points which  were  before
    the FtT.

26. In his oral submissions, counsel submitted that we should approach  the
    case in the manner proposed in Ali v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2016] UKSC 60.  On  the  facts  of  this  case  there  were
    circumstances which went well beyond those which  are  present  in  the
    case of someone who is deported. The appellant is a  protective  factor
    in his son's life as the Family Court had determined. It was he who had
    discovered that the child had bruises and "razor" cuts for which  there
    was no explanation. Whilst the police information before the  FtT  came
    from several years ago, the appellant had been ruthlessly policing  the
    circumstances  of  his  son  which  had  ensured  that  there  was   no
    repetition. It is not in the ordinary run of  things  that  deportation
    increases the risk of abuse and physical harm to a  child  which  makes
    this a very exceptional case.

27. G is a mixed race child and the appellant is the only link  he  has  to
    his Jamaican heritage, which is particularly important as  one  of  the
    appellant's concerns related to racist  abuse  directed  at  G  by  his
    stepfather.  Failing to address  G's  dual  heritage,  which  had  been
    accepted by the Family Court as being of significance, was an error  of
    law.

28. The FtTJ had said that there was no social services plan in  place,  no
    prospect of social work intervention and no immediate and obvious  risk
    factors. This was an error because it was the presence of the appellant
    as a protective factor which underpins the current circumstances and if
    the appellant  is  removed  G  may  well  be  taken  into  care.  State
    institutions could not be expected to be as alive to the risks  to  the
    child as the appellant who had brought injuries to their  attention  in
    the first place. The  conclusion  that  there  were  no  immediate  and
    obvious risk factors demonstrated a failure to engage with the evidence
    of razor injuries and police attendances which had been  drawn  to  the
    attention of the FtTJ.  In suggesting that ongoing contact by Skype was
    of importance, the FtTJ had  failed  to  recognise  that  it  would  be
    dependent on G's mother's cooperation and it was not possible to police
    the child's safety, as the appellant had been doing, via Skype.

Submissions for the Secretary of State

29. Mr Avery characterised the appellant's position as amounting to no more
    than disagreement with the FtTJ. Given the concurrent prison  sentences
    of 8 years for serious violence and 4 years  for  drugs  offences,  the
    appellant must meet the test in section 117C (6)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 so that it would not be  sufficient  to
    show that deportation would be unduly harsh. In  any  event  that  test
    could not be met in the circumstances of  this  case:  KO  (Nigeria)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] 1 WLR 5273  at  paras
    23 and 27.  The FtTJ had engaged with the appellant's concerns but  was
    not  satisfied  that  they  met  the  high  test  of  very   compelling
    circumstances.

30. The FtTJ had considered, at paras 41 and 42, if the child would  be  at
    risk of harm in the absence of the appellant. Whatever  concerns  there
    may be on the part of the appellant, the fact was that social  services
    had not deemed it necessary to intervene  and  most  of  the  incidents
    founded on are historic, relating to a time when the appellant  was  in
    prison. Whilst it is always possible to criticise a  determination  for
    lack of detail, on a fair reading of this determination  the  FtTJ  had
    taken into account the concerns raised and his conclusion that they  do
    not reach the section 117 C (6) threshold  was  a  conclusion  properly
    open to the FtTJ on the evidence.

Relevant law

31. The 2002 Act provides in section 117 C:

       "117C Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving foreign
       criminals
        (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
        (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
        the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
        (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
        sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
        public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
        Exception 2 applies.
        (4) Exception 1 applies where-
        (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of
        C's life,
        (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom,
        and
        (c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration
        into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.
        (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
        relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
        parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of
        C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.
        (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
        period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
        requires deportation unless there are very compelling
        circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and
        2.
        (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
        into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
        deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for
        the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
        been convicted."

32. We note the observations of Lord Reed and Lord Thomas in Ali, where the
    Supreme Court was not considering section 117C in its current terms but
    was considering the almost identical Immigration  Rules  398,  399  and
    399A:

         "38 The implication of the new rules is  that  paragraphs  399  and
         399A identify particular categories of case in which the  Secretary
         of State accepts that the public interest in the deportation of the
         offender is outweighed under article 8 by  countervailing  factors.
         Cases not covered by those rules (that is to say, foreign offenders
         who have received sentences of at least four  years,  or  who  have
         received sentences of between 12 months and four  years  but  whose
         private or family life does not meet the requirements of paragraphs
         399 and 399A) will be dealt with on the  basis  that  great  weight
         should generally be given to the public interest in the deportation
         of such offenders, but  that  it  can  be  outweighed,  applying  a
         proportionality test, by very compelling  circumstances:  in  other
         words, by a very strong claim indeed, as Laws LJ put it in  the  SS
         (Nigeria) case [2014] 1 WLR 998 . The countervailing considerations
         must be very compelling in order to  outweigh  the  general  public
         interest in the deportation  of  such  offenders,  as  assessed  by
         Parliament and the Secretary of State. The Strasbourg jurisprudence
         indicates relevant factors to consider, and paragraphs 399 and 399A
         provide an indication of the sorts of matters which  the  Secretary
         of State regards as very compelling. As explained at para 26 above,
         they can include factors  bearing  on  the  weight  of  the  public
         interest in the deportation of the particular offender, such as his
         conduct since  the  offence  was  committed,  as  well  as  factors
         relating to his private or family life. Cases  falling  within  the
         scope of section 32 of the 2007 Act in which the public interest in
         deportation is outweighed, other than those specified  in  the  new
         rules *4816 themselves, are likely to  be  a  very  small  minority
         (particularly in non-settled  cases).  They  need  not  necessarily
         involve any circumstance which is exceptional in the sense of being
         extraordinary (as counsel for  the  Secretary  of  State  accepted,
         consistently with the Huang case [2007] 2 AC 167 ,  para  20),  but
         they can be said to  involve  "exceptional  circumstances"  in  the
         sense that they involve a departure from the general rule."

    Lord Thomas proposed  that  an  FtT  judgment  in  a  "very  compelling
    circumstances" case might be structured in the following way:

         "83 One way of structuring such a judgment would be to follow  what
         has become known as the "balance sheet" approach. After  the  judge
         has found the facts, the judge would set out each of the "pros" and
         "cons" in what has been described as a "balance sheet" and then set
         out reasoned conclusions as to whether the  countervailing  factors
         outweigh the importance attached to  the  public  interest  in  the
         deportation of foreign offenders."

33. We note the judgment of the Supreme Court in KO  (Nigeria)  where  Lord
    Carnwath observed at para 23 that, "One is  looking  for  a  degree  of
    harshness going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child
    faced with the deportation of a parent" and at para 27 he endorsed this
    commentary on Exception 2 in 117 C (5):
         "27 Authoritative guidance as to the meaning of "unduly harsh" in
         this context was given by the Upper Tribunal (McCloskey J President
         and Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins) in MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2015] INLR 563 , para 46, a
         decision given on 15 April 2015. They referred to the "evaluative
         assessment" required of the tribunal:
             "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh'
             does not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable
             or merely difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more
             elevated threshold. 'Harsh' in this context, denotes something
             severe, or bleak. It is the antithesis of pleasant or
             comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the adverb 'unduly'
             raises an already elevated standard still higher.
                    ..."

Analysis

34. Whilst counsel founded principally on the danger potentially posed by X
    we note that in his statement of 7 September 2018, the appellant  spoke
    of X having caused problems in the  past  although  he  attributed  the
    child's safety to the deterrent effect of the  appellant's  involvement
    in G's life. The concerns he expressed focus on G's mother not  feeding
    him properly, failing to seek medical attention for minor ailments  and
    not providing effective personal care for G. He  feared  that  she  had
    abused G but social services  took  no  action  when  he  reported  his
    concerns. She was not ensuring that  he  was  adequately  supported  at
    school for his recently diagnosed condition.

35. The Family Court was aware that the appellant may be  deported  at  any
    time as Judge James noted in para 16 of  his  judgment  of  17  January
    2017.  At para 18 Judge James observed, in  light  of  the  possibility
    that the appellant will be deported, that immediate contact;

         "...may be the only short window of opportunity this boy will  have
         to really get to know his father. To my mind  that  makes  it  even
         more important that he is afforded  that  opportunity  even  if  it
         proves to be of short duration. He is of an age that it will  allow
         him to cement that relationship, so that he will be able to take it
         up again in a few year time. In the meantime he will still have the
         opportunity of keeping in touch with his  father  by  telephone  or
         more likely Skype. Further, whatever the mother may say now,  there
         is a distinct possibility that in time the child will  be  able  to
         visit his father in Jamaica. These few months  will  enable  father
         and son to share experiences that will help bond them and give them
         things to jointly remember. I will therefore  make  the  order  for
         contact in the form proposed by the father (which for the avoidance
         of doubt also includes holiday contact...)  Naturally  I  recognise
         that there is a possibility  that  this  contact  will  not  happen
         because the father is deported beforehand, but I  have  no  control
         over that."

36. At para 17, having noted that Ms Solly of CAFCASS  had  said  that  the
    appellant is a protective factor, noted the importance of  G  being  of
    dual heritage and the appellant's enthusiasm to introduce  him  to  his
    paternal culture Judge James reached findings which  were  relevant  to
    the issues put before the FtTJ:

         "The only harm that this child is suffering is the  consequence  of
         his parents' animosity to each other. The child is clearly aware of
         this but it does not detract from the importance of him  forming  a
         close attachment to his father. Both these parents are  capable  of
         meeting his needs."

37. From the information presented to the FtT and to US, we understand that
    G's mother maintained that she had separated from L's father  in  about
    2005 or 2006 and the last recorded incident relating to him at her home
    was 2013. According to the appellant's  2015  statement,  the  occasion
    when he was told about G being cut with a razor was in 2011.

38. Against this background, whilst L's father X may still have an interest
    in L which could  cause  him  to  contact  G's  mother,  there  was  no
    objective evidence of anything untoward  involving  X  having  happened
    since 2013. In those circumstances, there was no contemporary  external
    danger from which G required protection  and,  given  his  intermittent
    contact, it is difficult to see how effective the  appellant  could  be
    against the possibility of a random attendance by X. According  to  the
    appellant's statement of 2015, G's mother had formed a new relationship
    and had another child. As a matter of fact there  was  no  social  work
    intervention in G's home-life.

39. Accordingly we do not consider that the FtTJ made any error in  law  in
    assessing G's circumstances and safety and  the  extent  to  which  the
    appellant was required to protect G. The FtTJ was entitled to find that
    whilst G's home circumstances may not be ideal, there were no immediate
    and obvious risk factors.

40. The FtTJ understood that even if he were not  deported,  the  appellant
    would have contact with  his  son,  but  G  would  not  live  with  the
    appellant. He understood the issue of his dual heritage and  noted  the
    submission in that regard, and its evidential basis, at para 14 of  the
    determination. Judge James's order and judgment were founded on  before
    the FtTJ who plainly understood the decision and  reason;  paras  13-15
    and 40 of the determination.

41. Judge James had noted that Skype communication was one way in which the
    limited father/son relationship could continue  following  deportation.
    The FtTJ observed at para 44 that such communication offered a possible
    means for the appellant to monitor his son's welfare and that he  would
    be able to  draw  any  such  difficulty  to  the  attention  of  social
    services. This does not appear to us to  involve  the  FtTJ  suggesting
    that Skype communication was an adequate protection against a  material
    risk of harm. There was no contemporary material risk of  harm  as  the
    Family Court and the FtTJ were both entitled to conclude.

42. Accordingly we do not consider that there is any error of law, far less
    a material error of law. Even had there been such an error, we  do  not
    consider that it would have been open on the facts of this case for the
    FtTJ to find that there were very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above the family life exception in section  117  C  (5)  and  there  is
    nothing in the Supreme Court's judgment in Ali to  suggest  that  there
    is.

43. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal against the FtT's decision of  11
    October 2018 is dismissed.
