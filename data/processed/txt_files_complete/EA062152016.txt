For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      1.    The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
           Tribunal Ford on 29 November 2017 against the  determination  of
           First-tier Tribunal Judge I M Scott who had dismissed the appeal
           of the Appellant seeking entry clearance as the Extended  Family
           Member of  an  EEA  national  under  regulation  8  of  the  EEA
           regulations 2006, as the dependant  of  his  uncle,  an  Italian
           citizen.  The decision and reasons was promulgated  on  24  July
           2017.


      2.    The Appellant is a national of  India,  born  on  12  May  1984.
           Judge Scott applied Sala [2016] UKUT 411 (IAC) as he  was  bound
           to do and found that the appeal had to be dismissed for want  of
           jurisdiction.


      3.    Permission to appeal was granted in the First-tier  Tribunal  in
           the light of Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 where it  was  held  that
           Sala was wrongly decided.


      4.    On 22 January 2018 the Appellant's representative wrote  to  the
           Upper Tribunal indicating that the appeal should be  decided  in
           the Appellant's absence.


      5.    At the hearing Mr Tarlow  for  the  Respondent  was  obliged  to
           concede the appeal.  As there had been no hearing, the  decision
           and reasons should set aside  and  returned  to  the  First-tier
           Tribunal for hearing.


      6.    In the light of the concession, the tribunal  accordingly  finds
           that there was the material error of  law  identified  by  Judge
           Ford.  The onwards appeal is allowed.  The original decision and
           reasons is set aside and and returned to the First-tier Tribunal
           for hearing.


      DECISION


      The appeal is allowed


      The making of the previous decision involved the making of a  material
      error on a point of law.  The decision is set aside  and  returned  to
      the First-tier Tribunal for hearing, by any judge  except  Judge  I  M
      Scott.



      Signed                                  Dated 12 February 2018
