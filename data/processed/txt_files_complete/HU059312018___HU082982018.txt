                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  applicants'  appeal  against   the
    decision of 14 February 2018 refusing them indefinite leave  to  remain
    as the first applicant fell within the provisions of para 322 (5) of HC
    395 as amended.  In this decision I will refer to the parties  as  they
    were before the First-tier Tribunal, the applicants as  the  appellants
    and the Secretary of State as the respondent.

Background

2.    The appellants are citizens of Pakistan, born on 31 December 1983  and
    19 April 1989 respectively.  They are  husband  and  wife.   The  first
    appellant entered the UK as a student on 5  November  2006  with  entry
    clearance valid  until  31  December  2008.   He  was  granted  further
    extensions of leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) migrant and
    then as a Tier 1 (General) migrant.  On 5 November 2016 he applied  for
    indefinite  leave  to  remain  based  on  10  years  continuous  lawful
    residence. The second appellant is dependent on the  first  appellant's
    application.

3.    This application was refused under the provisions of  para  322(5)  as
    it was the respondent's view that it  was  undesirable  to  permit  the
    first appellant to remain in the  UK  in  the  light  of  his  conduct,
    character or associations.  In  consequence,  he  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of para 276B(ii) and (iii) for a grant of leave to  remain
    on the grounds of long residence.

4.    The respondent reached this decision as she  was  satisfied  that  the
    first appellant had used deception when  making  his  applications  for
    further leave to remain on 1 April 2010 and 2 December 2013  by  giving
    figures for his earnings from his  self-employment  which  contradicted
    those given in his tax returns to HMRC.  In  his  application  made  in
    2010 he gave the total figure for his earnings from self-employment  in
    his Tier 1 application as �17,635, whereas in his tax return he gave  a
    figure of �3,895.  His accountants calculated his tax liability for the
    financial year ending 2010 as �23.80 whereas on the  larger  figure  it
    should have been �3701.

5.    In his evidence, the first appellant said that he queried  the  figure
    of �23.80 with his accountants but they said it was correct.   When  he
    made his application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  2016,  he
    telephoned his accountants to get them to confirm that all the  figures
    for his accounts were correct and it was then that the errors  relating
    to his earnings from self-employment for the financial year ending 2010
    and subsequent years were discovered [19].  Subsequently,  amended  tax
    returns were filed for the financial years ending 2012, 2013 and  2014,
    disclosing underpayments of tax for these three years  of  respectively
    �4158.19, �2974.87 and �3329.76.  The underpaid tax has  been  paid  in
    full by the first appellant together with interest [20].

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

6.    At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, it was  agreed  between
    the parties that it was for the respondent to raise a prima facie  case
    of dishonesty against the first appellant  and  that  if  the  evidence
    provided did not establish such a  case,  then  the  refusal  would  be
    unsustainable.  If a prima facie case of dishonesty was established, it
    would be for the first appellant put forward a reasonable answer to the
    respondent's allegations and, were he unable to do so, the respondent's
    objection would prevail, whereas if he did so, then the objection would
    fail [16].  It was further agreed that if  the  judge  found  that  the
    first appellant had behaved  in  a  dishonest  manner,  then  he  could
    exercise the discretion contained within para 276B as a  refusal  under
    that paragraph was not mandatory [17].

7.    It was the first appellant's evidence that his  accountants  had  made
    mistakes involving large sums in his tax returns for years ending 2010,
    2012, 2013 and 2014.  The judge referred to a  letter  from  the  first
    appellant's accountants of 8 February 2016 in which it  was  said  that
    they understood  that  their  client  acted  had  "acted  honestly  and
    rectified the error when it came to his attention" [21]-[26].  He  said
    that that letter was ambiguous as it might be read as stating that  the
    first appellant had provided the inaccurate information [24].

8.    However, there was a later letter dated 22  June  2017  in  which  the
    accountants confirmed that the net profit for the period from September
    2009 to March 2010 for self-employment was  �17,635  but  the  accurate
    turnover figure provided by the first appellant for the preparation  of
    the tax return for the year ended 5 April 2010 was understated due to a
    calculation error in a spreadsheet.  The judge said that  that  wording
    corroborated the first appellant's statement that his  accountants  had
    told him that the mistake had arisen as a result of an error  in  their
    spreadsheet and that the fault was theirs [30].

9.    The judge summarised his findings as follows:

         "34.     However, whether the mistakes in the tax returns for years
         ending 2012 to 2014 resulted  from  faults  by  Mr  Arshad  or  his
         accountants, I am not satisfied that the errors contained  in  them
         were caused by Mr  Arshad's  dishonesty.   I  am  not  prepared  to
         conclude that Mr Ashad had provided inaccurate information  to  his
         accountants for those years, without having documentary evidence to
         see what precisely he did submit to them.  Even if the material  he
         submitted to them was inaccurate, I would have  to  decide  in  the
         light of that material, whether in submitting the material  he  did
         he was acting dishonestly.

         35.      After considering all the evidence I had before  me,  oral
         and documentary, I have come to the conclusion that the  respondent
         has not discharged the burden  on  her  of  demonstrating,  on  the
         balance of probabilities, that Mr  Arshad  behaved  dishonestly  in
         submitting the tax returns that were initially submitted for  years
         ending 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014.  In addition, she has  failed  to
         demonstrate that he acted dishonestly in  providing  the  financial
         information he did in support of the applications he  made  to  her
         for leave to  remain  dated,  respectively,  1  April  2010  and  2
         December 2013."

The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

10.   In the respondent's grounds of appeal, it is  argued  that  the  judge
    erred in law by failing to  take  into  consideration  that  the  first
    appellant was responsible for signing off his  accounts  and  the  fact
    that the misunderstanding in the figures  was  to  his  advantage;  the
    judge misunderstood the approach he should have taken as only the first
    appellant  or  his  accountants  could   provide   evidence   of   what
    documentation he  had  provided  to  his  accountants   and  the  first
    appellant benefited from his failure to  provide  documentation;  there
    was no regard to the delay of four years in rectifying the  discrepancy
    and the decision of HMRC not  to  apply  a  penalty  should  have  been
    regarded as irrelevant.

11.   Ms Isherwood adopted her grounds.  She referred to the judgment  in  R
    (o.a.o. Shahbaz  Khan)  v  Secretary  of  State  [2018]  UKUT  384  and
    submitted that the judge had been entitled to  infer  dishonestly  from
    the discrepancy in the figures submitted by the first appellant to  the
    respondent and to HMRC.  But  when  considering  his  explanation,  the
    judge had failed to resolve the  factual  issue  highlighted  at  [34],
    whether the inaccuracy in the information submitted was  the  fault  of
    the first appellant or his accountants.

12.   Ms Bagral submitted that the judge had properly  directed  himself  in
    accordance with the principles set out in Shahbaz Khan.  He  was  fully
    aware of the fact that amended tax returns had been submitted and  that
    no penalty had been incurred.  He was aware of the  delay  in  bringing
    the matter to the attention of HMRC.  The judge's comment that  he  had
    not been supplied with documentary evidence about  precisely  what  the
    first appellant had submitted to his accountants did not undermine  his
    finding of fact that on the evidence  before  him  the  respondent  had
    failed to discharge the burden of demonstrating dishonesty.

Assessment of the Issues.

13.   I will deal with the respondent's grounds in  turn.   It  is  asserted
    firstly that in paragraphs 28-34 the judge gave no consideration to the
    basic principle that the first appellant was responsible for  approving
    and signing off his accounts but simply accepted his account  that  for
    the years in question he was an unfortunate and innocent  victim  of  a
    misunderstanding.  However, there is no  reason  to  believe  that  the
    judge was not fully aware that the first appellant had to sign off  his
    accounts.  It was his case that he relied on his accountants, the judge
    noting the first appellant's evidence at [28] that he was not a  "money
    man" and that he had always relied on the accuracy of  the  information
    given to him by his accountants and paid what he was told to pay.

14.   It was a question of fact for the judge to decide what weight to  give
    to this evidence. This ground does not raise an issue of law.  It seeks
    to reargue an issue of fact. The grounds then argue that the judge  had
    no regard to the fact that  this  misunderstanding  was  to  the  first
    appellant's financial advantage as it meant that he did not have to pay
    his tax on time.  The  fact  that  it  was  to  the  first  appellant's
    advantage is self-evident as is  the  fact  that  the  first  appellant
    subsequently rectified matters.  The judge would have been  well  aware
    of this. This ground again raises issues of fact, which  were  for  the
    judge to assess in the light of the evidence as a whole.

15.   It is then argued that the judge misunderstood the approach he  should
    have taken.  There is no substance in this ground.  The  judge's  self-
    direction on the law at [16] is entirely consistent with  the  judgment
    of the High Court in Shahbaz  Khan  as  summarised  in  the  italicised
    headnote.  It is argued that the judge erred at [34]  of  his  decision
    when he said that he would not find against the first appellant  unless
    he could see what evidence he had provided to his accountants.   It  is
    argued that the only people who could provide this  evidence  were  the
    first appellant and his accountants and it is difficult to see how  the
    first appellant  should  benefit  from  his  failure  to  provide  this
    evidence and to allow it to be tested.

16.   I am not satisfied that this ground indicates that the judge erred  in
    law.  He had to determine the appeal  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
    before him.  In his assessment of the evidence, the judge was  entitled
    to comment on the absence of evidence he might have  expected  to  see,
    but it is then for him to decide what inferences of fact to  draw  from
    the failure to produce that evidence.  The judge was aware  that  there
    was or might be evidence, which was not before him but, nonetheless, he
    had to decide what findings to make on the evidence  which  was  before
    him.  I am satisfied that the judge in his comment in [34]  was  simply
    making the point that the evidence before him  was  not  sufficient  to
    satisfy him that the first appellant had been dishonest.

17.   It was also argued that the judge had no regard to the timing  of  the
    first appellant's attempts to rectify the position but, again, he  must
    have been aware of this as it was clear from the chronology and it  was
    him to decide what weight to attach to the delay.  It  is  argued  that
    the conduct of HMRC in deciding what penalties to  apply  to  the  late
    payment were a matter for that organisation and that their decision has
    no impact on the decision whether or not leave should be granted. There
    is no substance in this ground. No penalties were imposed, and  reasons
    were given in the letter from HMRC dated 12 May 2016  as  follows:  "In
    this instance we have reduced the maximum amount payable, 100%  of  the
    tax, to 0 due to abatements for telling of 30%, helping 40% and  giving
    access 30%".  The fact that HMRC chose not to impose a penalty,  whilst
    by no means determinative, was  nonetheless  a  factor  the  judge  was
    entitled to take into account.

18.   In summary, I am not satisfied that the judge erred in law by  finding
    that the respondent had not shown on a balance  of  probabilities  that
    the first appellant had acted dishonestly.  There were grounds on which
    the respondent could properly infer that the first appellant  had  been
    dishonest, but he provided an explanation which the judge was  entitled
    to accept and to find, in consequence, that the respondent  had  failed
    to discharge the onus of proving dishonestly. This was  a  question  of
    fact for the judge to assess in the light of the evidence as  a  whole.
    Whilst another judge might have  reached  a  different  decision,  this
    judge reached a decision properly open to him for the reasons he gave.

Decision.

19.   The First-tier Tribunal did not in law and the decision to  allow  the
    appeal stands.
