                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal brought in  relation  to  a  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Gibbs promulgated on 29 February 2016.  The appellant is
    a citizen of Pakistan who applied for entry  clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom as the spouse of Mobeena Kafiat, whom I shall refer to  as  the
    sponsor.  That application was refused by the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    in Islamabad.  The ground for refusal was that the appellant had failed
    to meet  the  financial  requirements  in  relation  to  the  sponsor's
    employment as prescribed in Appendix FM-SE.

2.   Permission to appeal in this  matter  was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Canavan on 8 September 2016 on the basis  that  it  was  arguable
    that the judge had erred in requiring the appellant to produce invoices
    relating to the sponsor's self-employed work when paragraph A1(7)(f) of
    Appendix FM does not require such evidence.   It  was  also  considered
    arguable that the judge had erred in failing to  consider  whether  the
    bank statements produced in fact showed the required  level  of  income
    notwithstanding that two different totals had been  arrived  at.   Both
    figures exceeded the required level of �18,600.

3.   The appeal has been advanced before  me  on  these  two  grounds.   The
    appellant's representative has indicated  that  if  one  looks  at  the
    deposits made into the bank account during the period in  question  the
    total figure amounts to �21,421 when both  employed  and  self-employed
    income are taken together.

4.   The difficulty which  I  have  had  experienced  reflects  the  obvious
    problem which the judge experienced, namely  the  lack  of  correlation
    between deposits made into the sponsor's bank account and the source of
    those deposits.  I enquired  of  the  appellant's  representative  what
    documentary evidence there may  be  for  a  couple  of  random  example
    deposits and was informed  that  there  was  none,  only  an  assertion
    regarding source in the appellant's  evidence.   It  therefore  follows
    that even at this stage before me there is  nothing  to  demonstrate  a
    correlation between deposits and their source.

5.   One of the requirements in relation to Appendix FM-SE is  at  paragraph
    7(f), which reads:

"personal bank statements for the same twelve month period as the tax
return(s) showing that the income from self-employment has been paid into
an account in the name of the person or in the name of the person and their
partner jointly."

6.   Due to the lack of correlation which I have already identified it was
impossible for the judge to be certain as to the sources of the various
income figures.  The judge at paragraphs 11 and following sought to do the
best as she could on the limited information which was available for her.

7.   There is unfortunate reference within these paragraphs to the
production of invoices, notwithstanding that paragraph 7(f) does not
expressly require invoices to be provided.

8.   The impression given is that the judge did not properly apply her mind
to the documentation before her in the context of the statutory regime
under Appendix FM-SE.  I cannot be confident that the matter was given
proper consideration and anxious scrutiny.

9.   In many ways the appellant himself is to blame for the manner in which
the documentation was prepared but in the circumstances, and not without
some reluctance, I am persuaded that there is an error of law and the
proper course is to set aside the decision in the First-tier Tribunal.

10.  It follows, unless I hear persuasive argument to the contrary, that
this matter should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard by a
judge other than Judge Gibbs to be looked at afresh and proper
investigation made as to whether the appellant can demonstrate that
financial requirements have been met.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside  and  the  matter  is
remitted to be decided  afresh  by  a  judge  other  than  Judge  Gibbs.  No
findings of fact are preserved.

No anonymity direction is made.
