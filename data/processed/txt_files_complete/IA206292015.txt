                                     And

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
                                DETERMINATION


   1. On 18th January 2016 I made the following order:


            1.    It appears that there has been a procedural  irregularity
            in that the applicant requested an oral hearing  and  paid  the
            necessary additional fee prior to promulgation of the  decision
            in this appeal.
            2.    Subject to representations to the contrary to be received
            within five working days of the date this decision is  sent,  I
            propose to set aside the decision of the  First  tier  Tribunal
            and  remit  the  appeal  for  hearing  before  the  First  Tier
            Tribunal, thus saving time and expense to all parties.


   2. Neither party having made representations to the contrary I set  aside
      the decision of the  First  tier  Tribunal  and  remit  the  case  for
      rehearing before the First tier Tribunal (before a  judge  other  than
      Judge Mitchell) - no findings preserved.
