For the Appellant:     Mr Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Richardson, Counsel, instructed by Morgan Mark
Solicitors


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

1.   This is an appeal that was allowed at the First-tier.

2.   The Secretary of State had been given permission to  appeal  against  a
    decision allowing the appellant's appeal under the Tier 1  Entrepreneur
    Rules.  This decision was by First-tier Tribunal Judge Swaniker,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 30 April 2014.

3.   At the hearing before me Mr Avery, for the Secretary of  State,  sought
    leave to withdraw the  Secretary  of  State's  case  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The basis of this application was that a legal letter had in
    fact been provided with the application, and Mr Avery did not  seek  to
    go outside the tightly drafted grounds on which permission was granted.



4.   There was  some  discussion  as  to  a  minor  error  in  [14]  of  the
    determination in relation to the need within paragraph 41-SD for such a
    letter, but it was accepted that this did not alter the position.

5.   Having considered the matter I gave leave for  the  withdrawal  of  the
    Secretary of State's case in accordance with Rule 17  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

6.   As a consequence of the withdrawal the judge's  decision  allowing  the
    appeal on  stands.



Signed                                  Date


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Gibb
