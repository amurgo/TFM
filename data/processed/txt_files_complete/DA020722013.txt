For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This appeal is subject  to  an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
       Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither party invited
       us to rescind the order and we continue it pursuant to rule 14 of the
       Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (SI  2008/2698  as
       amended).

    2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the determination
       of a panel of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Britton and Mr P Bompas)
       in which the panel allowed the appeal of HAD, a citizen  of  Austria,
       against the Secretary of State's decision to make a deportation order
       by reference to regulations 19(3)(b) and  24(3)  of  the  Immigration
       (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 and section 3(5)(a) of  the
       Immigration Act 1971.  We  shall  refer  to  HAD  as  the  Applicant,
       although he was the Appellant in the proceedings below.

    3. The decision to make a deportation order was made as a consequence of
       the Applicant's conviction on 21 October  2011  at  Gloucester  Crown
       Court of possessing a class A controlled drug with intent  to  supply
       and his subsequent sentence to 8 years and 6 months imprisonment. The
       Applicant exercised his right of appeal against the decision to  make
       the deportation order to the First-tier Tribunal.  This is the appeal
       which came before the panel on 24 March 2014 and  was  allowed.   The
       Secretary of State applied for permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
       Tribunal.  The application was refused by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Ford on 28 April 2014 but  on  renewal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was
       allowed by Judge Rintoul in the following terms

           "It is arguable that the  First-tier  Tribunal  have  failed  to
           properly identify the basis on which the appeal was allowed, and
           failed  properly  to  engage  with  the  Immigration   (European
           Economic Area) Regulations 2006."

    4. At the hearing before us the Applicant was not  legally  represented.
       His father attended the hearing. Mr Mills represented  the  Secretary
       of State and submitted copies of the Court of Appeal decision in SSHD
       v Dumliauskas and others [2015] EWCA Civ 145 and the judgement of the
       Court of Justice of the European Union in Onuekwere v SSHD  C-378/12.
       As the Applicant was not represented we explained the nature  of  the
       proceedings to him and the procedure to be followed.

    Submissions

    5. For the Secretary of State, Mr  Mills  referred  to  the  grounds  of
       appeal and to the decision in Land  Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg  v  Tsakouridis
       [2011] CMLR 11. The issue of rehabilitation  in  the  United  Kingdom
       rather than the home state or state of origin is only  relevant  when
       the offender is  genuinely  integrated.  Referring  to  the  Advocate
       General's opinion in Onuekwere Mr Mills said that  serious  offending
       is a demonstration  against  integration.   Rehabilitative  prospects
       require genuine integration. Paragraph 34 of the panel's decision  is
       very brief and does not adequately explain why the  appeal  has  been
       allowed.

    6. The Applicant said that he is genuinely integrated  into  the  United
       Kingdom. He has been he since he was 13 years  old  and  he  went  to
       school  and  college  here.  He  has  been  studying  with  the  Open
       University in prison. He has been in this country for 11 years and he
       has lots of friends here. His  potential  of  reconviction  has  been
       assessed as low. The Applicant said that he has a strong family  unit
       in this country and this reduces the prospects of re-offending  still
       further. He wants a second chance  with  his  family  in  the  United
       Kingdom. This was, in effect, a first conviction at the age of 20. He
       denied that it showed an escalation in offending as  alleged  by  the
       Secretary of State. The Applicant said that having  left  Austria  at
       the age of 13 he has no ties there. All of his family are here.

    7. We reserved our decision.

Decision

    8. The Applicant was born in Iraq on 3 October 1990 and moved to Austria
       in 1997 with his parents and his younger  brother  where  the  family
       were all granted asylum and subsequently  Austrian  nationality.  The
       family moved to the United Kingdom on 1 April  2004.  On  21  October
       2011 the Applicant was convicted of the possession of class  A  drugs
       with intent to supply. It was to all intents  and  purposes  a  first
       offence (as  shown  by  the  Trial  Judge's  sentencing  remarks  the
       Applicant was a man of previously good character) but it was  a  most
       serious offence involving drugs with a  street  value  of  about  one
       million pounds and in which the applicant played a significant  role.
       The seriousness of the offence is reflected in the sentence of  eight
       and a half years imprisonment.

    9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is succinct. There is however
       no suggestion that it does not take account  of  all  salient  facts.
       Paragraphs 33 and 34 explain why the panel reached their decision  to
       allow the appeal. It is clear from these paragraphs that  the  panel,
       having heard oral evidence from the Applicant and his father, came to
       the conclusion that the Applicant had learned his lesson and with the
       support of his family was well along the road to rehabilitation.

   10. The Secretary of State's assertion of error  of  law  is  three-fold.
       Firstly it is asserted that the findings of the panel are unclear and
       fail to identify the basis upon which  the  appeal  was  allowed.  Mr
       Mills, correctly in our view, did not seek to pursue this in his oral
       submissions. The findings of the First-tier Tribunal are, as we  have
       described them above, succinct but nevertheless clear  at  paragraphs
       33 and 34 that the  appeal  was  allowed  by  reference  to  the  EEA
       regulations.

   11. Secondly the Secretary of State asserts that the panel have failed to
       make lawful findings on whether there are serious grounds to  warrant
       the Applicant's deportation. It is  suggested  that  the  panel  have
       materially misdirected themselves in  placing  undue  weight  on  the
       Applicant's rehabilitative prospects. The assertion, emphasised by Mr
       Mills, is that  the  Applicant  has  not  met  the  test  of  genuine
       integration.

   12. In our judgment this assertion is ill-founded. The panel  found,  and
       we can see no error in their factual findings, that the Applicant has
       been living in the United Kingdom since the  age  of  13  and  has  a
       permanent right  of  residence.  At  the  time  of  the  offence  the
       Applicant had been resident in the United Kingdom for  some  7  years
       and had attended school and college  in  this  country.  All  of  his
       family lived here. Genuine integration is a matter of fact and in our
       judgment there is no error of  law  in  these  factual  findings  and
       although the panel does not use the term there could be no reason  to
       find that the Applicant was  not  genuinely  integrated.  We  do  not
       accept Mr Mills proposition that the  commission  of  an  offence  of
       itself militates against genuine integration and  we  do  not  accept
       that the Advocate General's opinion in  Onuekwere  is  authority  for
       such a proposition. In our judgment the panel's conclusions that

           "... the appellant is very  remorseful  for  his  offending  and
           appreciates the effect that drugs has on the community  and  the
           misery it brings with it. We are satisfied  that  the  Appellant
           has learnt his lesson the hard way being  sentenced  to  a  long
           term of  imprisonment  at  a  young  age.  We  accept  that  the
           appellant's rehabilitation would be better served  by  remaining
           in this country and having the direct support of his family"

       are conclusions that were open to the  panel.  Having  reached  these
       conclusion the panel's assessment that it would not be  proportionate
       (in the terms of  the  EEA  regulations)  for  the  Applicant  to  be
       deported to Austria was, in our judgment, properly open to the panel.
       It cannot be said to be irrational on the basis of all  the  evidence
       and the sustainable findings of the panel.

   13. The final assertion made relates to the panel's finding (at paragraph
       35) that is would be disproportionate  to  deport  the  Applicant  by
       reference to Article 8 ECHR. Having found that the panel did not  err
       in law in allowing the appeal by reference  to  the  EEA  Regulations
       there is no need for us to consider this  assertion  further  as  the
       Applicant's appeal succeeds in any event under the EEA Regulations.

Conclusion

   14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of
       a material error of law. The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed
       and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow  this  appeal
       under the EEA regulations stands.
