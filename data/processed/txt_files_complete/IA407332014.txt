                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appealed  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Davies  promulgated  9.1.15,  allowing  the  claimant's
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  to
    issue the claimant with an EEA Derivative Residence Card,  pursuant  to
    regulation 15A(4A)(c) of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006.  The
    Judge heard the appeal on 5.1.15.

 2. There was no challenge to the judge's finding that the claimant was and
    is the primary carer for her child. The issue in the appeal was whether
    the child would, in theory, be unable to reside in the  UK  or  another
    EEA State if the claimant were required to leave, the burden  being  on
    the claimant to discharge. The judge concluded at �25 of  the  decision
    that if the appellant was removed from the United  Kingdom  her  son  a
    British national would be forced to leave with her.  After  finding  at
    �24 that the appellant is the primary carer of her son, the judge  went
    on at �25 to state, "It is  also  clear  from  the  evidence  that  the
    appellant has cared for her son throughout his life up to  the  present
    and that no-one else within the  United  Kingdom  could  care  for  the
    appellant's son if the appellant could no longer remain."

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    26.2.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  For the reasons set out in my error of law decision, I found
    that there was such error of law in the making of the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal as to require the decision of Judge  Davies  to  be
    set aside and remade. In summary, I found  insufficient  reasoning  for
    the finding that the claimant's child would be forced to leave  the  EU
    on the hypothetical basis of the removal of the claimant from the UK.

 5. Although Judge Davis found that the claimant was the primary  carer  of
    her son, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the claimant,
    whom the judge found lacked credibility, had discharged the  burden  of
    proof on her.  At �22  the  judge  concluded,  "I  also  find  it  more
    probable than not that the  appellant  has  regular  contact  with  her
    mother and her mother's family and in all probability has more  regular
    contact with her son's father than she has been prepared to admit."  It
    was noted at �19 that the father has supported the child's  application
    for a British passport and that he was  receiving  child  support.  The
    claimant told me at the hearing that she had asked him to do this,  and
    that he arranged for that to be transferred to her  bank  account,  but
    maintained that he didn't want to see her or have anything to  do  with
    the child.

 6. In the circumstances, it is difficult to see on what  basis  the  judge
    found or could have concluded on  the  evidence  before  him  that  the
    claimant had discharged the burden of proving that if she were required
    to leave the UK, the hypothetical situation  given  that  there  is  no
    removal decision and no article 8 application for leave to remain,  her
    child would be unable to reside in the UK or  another  EEA  state.  The
    conclusion appears to be based on the unchallenged finding that she  is
    the primary carer. However, even if no one else helps  look  after  the
    child and she is and always has been the sole carer, that does not mean
    that the child would be unable to remain  in  the  UK  or  another  EEA
    State. Whilst adoption or Social Services care  has  been  held  to  be
    insufficient, on the evidence  before  the  Tribunal  there  are  other
    family members, including the father and/or  the  child's  grandmother,
    who may be able to  look  after  the  child.  Neither  is  the  alleged
    unwillingness of the father to look after the child, the  determinative
    factor.

 7. It should be recalled  that  the  Zambrano  principle  does  not  cover
    anything short of a situation where the EU citizen is in theory  forced
    to leave the territory of the EU, and is not an assessment  whether  it
    would be disproportionate to require the  claimant  to  leave  the  UK,
    leaving her child behind. As is clear from the Court of Appeal case  of
    Maureen Hines v London Borough of  Lambeth  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  660,  in
    applying the test under regulation 15A(4A)(c) is clear it is  necessary
    to consider the welfare of the British citizen child and the extent  to
    which the quality or standard of his life will be impaired if the  non-
    EU citizen is required to  leave.  This  is  all  for  the  purpose  of
    answering the  question  whether  the  child  would,  as  a  matter  of
    practicality,  be  unable  to  remain  in  the  UK.  This  requires   a
    consideration, amongst other things, of the impact which the removal of
    the primary carer would have on the child,  and  the  alternative  care
    available for the child. For this purpose  it  was  generally  accepted
    that an available adoption  or  foster  care  placement  would  not  be
    adequate because the quality of the life  of  the  child  would  be  so
    seriously impaired by his removal from  his  mother  to  be  placed  in
    foster care that he would be effectively compelled  to  leave.  It  was
    also said, however, that all things being equal the removal of a  child
    from the care  of  one  responsible  parent  to  the  care  of  another
    responsible parent would not  normally  be  expected  so  seriously  to
    impair his quality and standard of life that he  would  be  effectively
    forced to leave the UK. Apart from anything else, he would, even if  he
    did leave, still only have the care of one of his previously two  joint
    carers.

 8. Although less than desirable, the child might  be  able  to  be  looked
    after - to the extent that his age and  other  circumstances  made  him
    dependent on the care of another person - by  someone  other  than  the
    current primary carer, such as the British  citizen  father.  It  would
    only be if no adequate arrangements (not including  adoption  or  other
    state care facilities) could be made, that the child would  effectively
    have to leave.

 9. I found that these issues were not adequate addressed in  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal such that it must be set aside  and  remade.
    However, to enable the claimant, who was at somewhat of a  disadvantage
    at the hearing, to better prepare her case and consider obtaining legal
    representation, I considered that it  would  be  fair  to  adjourn  the
    remaking of the decision, reserved to myself in the Upper Tribunal.

10. Thus the matter was  relisted  before  me  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  on
    12.11.15. However, there was no attendance  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
    claimant. An explanation for that absence probably  lies  in  the  fact
    that following the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  claimant
    made a further application to the Secretary of  State  on  30.3.15  for
    leave to remain as a parent under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.
    That application was granted under D-LTRPT 1.2 of Appendix  FM  by  the
    decision of 18.6.15, a copy of which is now with the case  papers.  The
    Secretary of State was satisfied that on the  information  provided  by
    the  claimant  she  met  the  relevant  eligibility   and   suitability
    requirements and that she had a genuine parental  relationship  with  a
    child and that it is not reasonable to expect that child to  leave  the
    UK.

11. I am satisfied that the claimant was notified of the hearing before me,
    by the notice issued by the Tribunal on 16.10.15 and that it is in  the
    public interest to proceed with the remaking of  the  decision  in  the
    appeal immediately. It is likely that she has nothing further to add to
    the EEA Derivative Residence  Card  appeal.  In  the  circumstances,  I
    dismiss the appeal on the basis that the claimant failed  to  discharge
    the burden on her to demonstrate that if she is removed from the UK her
    child would be forced to leave the territory of the EU.

Decision:

The appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
