                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen  of  India  born  on  8th  July  1993.   She
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 2nd  December  2014
    which was to refuse to vary her leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    and to give directions for her removal to India under Section 47 of the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  Her appeal  was  allowed
    at first instance by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Roopnarine-Davies
    sitting at Taylor House on 8th July 2015.  The Respondent appeals  with
    leave against that decision and for the reasons which I set  out  below
    at paragraphs 12 to 21 I have set aside the decision at first  instance
    on the grounds of a material error of law and have re-heard the appeal.
     I therefore continue to refer to the parties as  they  were  known  at
    first instance for the sake of convenience  notwithstanding  that  this
    matter comes initially before me as an appeal by the Respondent.

2.   The Appellant entered the United  Kingdom  on  3rd  October  2010  with
    leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student valid until  30th  September  2014.
    On 30th June 2011 whilst studying in the United Kingdom  the  Appellant
    applied for indefinite leave to remain as the dependent  child  of  her
    father (at the time she was 17 years old).  On 24th  August  2011  this
    application was refused by the Respondent with no right of appeal.   On
    25th October 2013 the Appellant made a  further  application  that  was
    refused under paragraphs 322 of the Immigration Rules  on  the  grounds
    that she was applying for a purpose not covered  by  the  Rules.   This
    refusal dated 25th February 2014 also did not carry a right of  appeal.
    The Appellant obtained a BSc (Hons) in Pharmacology in July  2014.   On
    29th September 2014 she applied for indefinite leave to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom on the grounds of her private and family  life  in  this
    country.

3.   The Appellant's father entered the United  Kingdom  illegally  in  2002
    leaving behind his wife and two children.  He obtained leave to  remain
    in the United Kingdom in October 2010 under the legacy  scheme  and  is
    now a British citizen.  His wife and children visited him in the United
    Kingdom in 2007 and 2009 and he has visited India since he was  granted
    indefinite leave  to  remain.   Following  the  grant  of  to  him  the
    Appellant's mother and brother applied for and were  granted  leave  to
    enter and remain in the United Kingdom as his dependants from  December
    2013 until December 2015 when they  would  be  eligible  to  apply  for
    indefinite leave to  remain.   The  Appellant's  brother  is  presently
    studying in the United Kingdom.

The Explanation for Refusal

4.   The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for leave to  remain
    based on her private life finding that the Appellant could not meet the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  At the time
    of her application the Appellant was aged 21 but had not spent at least
    half of her life living in the United Kingdom.   It  was  not  accepted
    that there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the  Appellant's
    reintegration to India if she were required to leave the United Kingdom
    because she had previously lived in India  for  seventeen  years.   She
    would be familiar with the language and culture there.  There  were  no
    particular circumstances set out in the application  which  constituted
    exceptional circumstances which might warrant grant  of  leave  outside
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

5.   The Appellant had claimed that  her  family  were  all  in  the  United
    Kingdom and she was financially dependent upon her father.  However the
    family  life  which  she  had  with  her  relatives  did  not  in   the
    Respondent's view constitute family life as set out in Appendix  FM  of
    the Immigration Rules.  Her relationship with her family could continue
    from overseas via modern methods of communication.  She could apply for
    entry clearance should she wish to return  to  the  United  Kingdom  to
    visit her family and friends.  It  would  be  open  to  her  father  to
    financially support her from the United Kingdom if they  wished.   Upon
    return to India she could seek employment there,  something  which  she
    was currently unable to do in the United Kingdom lawfully.

The Decision at First Instance

6.   At paragraph 7 and following the Judge gave  her  reasons  for  finding
    that the appeal should be allowed outside the  Immigration  Rules.   It
    was not doubted  that  the  Appellant  did  not  meet  Appendix  FM  or
    paragraph 276ADE but as the Rules were not a  complete  code  a  second
    stage and separate assessment under Article 8  (right  to  respect  for
    private and family life) was required.  The  Appellant  had  family  in
    India but her close family were in the United Kingdom.  It had not been
    shown on balance that the  family  home  in  India  had  been  sold  as
    claimed.  However the Appellant was not living an independent life  and
    was financially and emotionally dependent on her  family  unit.   There
    was family life between the Appellant  and  her  family  members  which
    would be interfered with by the Respondent's decision.   There  was  no
    blanket rule that adult children cease to have family life with parents
    simply by reaching 18.

7.   The Judge held at paragraph 9 of her determination that the  Respondent
    had not considered Article 8 as a discrete issue including  the  impact
    of the Respondent's decision on the Appellant's family members and  the
    Appellant's circumstances if the Appellant had to return  to  India  on
    her own.  The Respondent's decision was terse and did not substantively
    engage with the particular circumstances of the Appellant or the impact
    of the Appellant's separation from  her  family  and  their  rights  to
    respect for family life under Article 8.   The  Judge  found  that  the
    Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the law but the  Judge
    did not consider it appropriate to go on and decide the Article 8 claim
    herself "in circumstances where the Appellant's mother and brother have
    only limited leave".

8.   The Judge added at paragraph 10:

         "Though I was not addressed on the point it occurs to me  that  the
         Respondent may well have  a  policy  on  the  treatment  of  legacy
         dependants for immigration purposes.  This  appeared  not  to  have
         been explored at the time of the Appellant's  application  in  2011
         when she was only 17 years old.  The Respondent should consider all
         matters comprehensively."

9.   She held that the Respondent had failed to demonstrate a  consideration
    of discretion outside the Rules.  More  was  required  than  simply  to
    assert that the Respondent had considered the Appellant's claim  on  an
    exceptional basis.  The appeal was allowed to the limited  extent  that
    the Respondent's decision was unlawful and remained outstanding  for  a
    lawful decision to be taken.

The Onward Appeal

10.  The Respondent appealed against the Judge's decision arguing  that  the
    decision to allow the appeal on the grounds the  Respondent's  decision
    was not in accordance with the law was ultra vires.  The refusal letter
    had considered the exercise of the Respondent's  decision  outside  the
    Rules.  The Appellant had claimed to be financially  dependent  on  her
    father and that claim was acknowledged  in  the  refusal  letter  which
    indicated that the Respondent understood the claim.   In  the  case  of
    Ganesabalan [2014] EWHC 2712 it was held that the  Respondent  was  not
    required to undertake any particular review or assessment  or  parallel
    assessment of a claim.  In order to be a lawful decision the Respondent
    was required to address her mind to the question of discretion and  was
    required in her reasons to demonstrate that she had done so in whatever
    conclusion she had reached.  The Respondent had done this.  Even if the
    decision was terse that  was  not  enough  to  establish  that  it  was
    unlawful.  The grounds cited two paragraphs from page 2 of the  refusal
    letter which I have summarised  above  (see  paragraphs  4  and  5)  as
    evidence that the Respondent had considered the issue of discretion.

11.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert on 28th October  2015.   In  granting
    permission to appeal she wrote that the grounds disclosed  an  arguable
    error of  law.   The  grounds  had  argued  that  the  Judge  erred  in
    concluding failure by the Respondent to  demonstrate  consideration  of
    exercise of her discretion  outside  the  Rules.   "Excerpts  from  the
    refusal letter set out in the  grounds  render  the  ground  arguable".
    Although there was no Rule 24 response to the grant of permission,  the
    Appellant's solicitors filed and served a bundle for the Upper Tribunal
    proceedings comprising statements of the Appellant's  parents  and  the
    Appellant herself and  further  financial  documents  together  with  a
    skeleton argument prepared by Counsel who appeared before me.

The Error of Law Stage

12.  The matter thus came to me in the first place to decide  whether  there
    was an error of law in the Judge's determination such that the decision
    fell to be set aside and the matter re-heard.  If there  was  not  then
    the decision at first instance would stand.  I queried  at  the  outset
    with both representatives whether there was in fact any policy  of  the
    type referred to by the Judge in her determination, that is to say  for
    the  dependants  of  successful  legacy  applicants.    Neither   party
    indicated that they had been able to discover any such.

13.  For the Respondent reliance  was  placed  on  the  grounds.   In  reply
    Counsel relied on his skeleton argument which argued that  the  refusal
    letter had not covered all the issues that were raised  that  would  be
    relevant at the proportionality stage of an assessment under Article 8.
     There were representations about the absence of any home in India  and
    the cultural difficulties faced by a young woman in the absence of  her
    immediate family on whom she was dependent.  The Respondent's treatment
    of Article 8 was muddled referring to  both  exceptional  circumstances
    and also whether family life came within the Rules.   It  was  not  the
    case that if the Respondent's assessment under Article 8 was  defective
    the matter could be cured by an appeal to the  Tribunal.   It  was  not
    reasonable for the  Respondent  to  imply  that  there  were  different
    standards of adequacy of reasoning  in  refusal  letters  depending  on
    whether the  application  carried  a  right  of  appeal  or  not.   The
    Respondent was the primary decision  maker  and  it  was  not  fair  to
    Appellants to have less than a full timeous consideration  of  all  the
    relevant matters without having to  appeal  to  obtain  such  a  proper
    consideration.  In any event it was not good for the administration  of
    justice for there to be two standards of refusal letters  depending  on
    whether the decision was appealable or otherwise.

14.  In oral submissions Counsel supported the Judge's  characterisation  of
    the refusal letter as terse.  There had been  no  engagement  with  the
    effect on the family in line with the authority of Beoku-Betts.  If the
    Respondent's decision was judicially reviewed (as opposed to being  the
    subject to an appeal to the Tribunal) it would be found to be  unlawful
    as not covering material matters.  It could not be that such a decision
    would be acceptable where there was an appeal to a Tribunal.   The  key
    to  this  case  was  the  effect  on  the  wider  family.   It  was  an
    unsatisfactory position if a refusal letter would not be acceptable  in
    judicial review proceedings but would be in an appeal to the  Tribunal.
    The Judge could in fact have heard the Article 8 appeal herself.

15.   In  response  the  Presenting  Officer  argued  that  judicial  review
    proceedings and statutory  appeals  to  the  Tribunal  were  two  quite
    different matters.  Judicial review was  a  challenge  of  last  resort
    whereas in a statutory appeal the Tribunal was  remaking  the  decision
    itself not simply setting aside the previous decision.

16.  At the close of the submissions I indicated that I found  there  was  a
    material error of law in the Judge's decision such that it fell  to  be
    set aside and the appeal re-heard.  It appeared  to  be  common  ground
    that the Appellant could not bring herself within either Appendix FM or
    paragraph 276ADE.  The Judge had decided that the Respondent's decision
    was unlawful because the Respondent  had  not  considered  whether  the
    Appellant's appeal could be allowed outside the Rules.  That gave  rise
    to the question whether there was a private and/or  family  life  which
    would  be  disproportionately  interfered  with  by  the   Respondent's
    decision.

17.  The Appellant's argument is that the refusal letter was inadequate  and
    had this been a judicial review hearing would  have  been  successfully
    attacked as disclosing an inadequacy of reasoning.  This however is not
    a judicial review hearing, it is a statutory appeal  and  the  question
    before me is whether there is a sufficient indication  in  the  refusal
    letter that the Respondent has  shown  an  awareness  that  she  has  a
    discretion outside the Rules and has shown that she has made a decision
    one way or the other under that discretion.

18.  The refusal letter states that the Respondent  has  considered  whether
    the particular circumstances of the  Appellant  constitute  exceptional
    circumstances outside the Rules under Article 8.   Whilst  the  refusal
    letter is concise, that of itself  does  not  make  it  unlawful.   The
    question is whether the Respondent is aware of the salient features  of
    the case and has directed her mind to them.  The Respondent  was  aware
    of the Appellant's claim to be financially dependent on her father  and
    aware that the Appellant could not obtain work lawfully at the  present
    time because of her immigration status.   Those  were  not  exceptional
    circumstances in the Respondent's view which meant that the Appellant's
    application should be granted outside the Rules.  When  the  Respondent
    stated that the family life the Appellant claimed  did  not  constitute
    family life "as set out in Appendix FM" the Respondent was stating that
    the Appellant's claim  to  a  family  life  did  not  fall  within  the
    Immigration Rules.

19.  I see nothing muddled in that approach.  The Respondent was obliged  to
    consider first whether the Appellant's claim could  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules and she decided for the reasons she gave that it  did
    not.  What the Respondent did acknowledge in  the  refusal  letter  was
    what was referred to as "the relationship with your  family".   It  was
    that relationship, outside the  Rules  which  the  Respondent  did  not
    consider  constituted   exceptional   circumstances   such   that   the
    application fell to be refused.  It is correct that the Respondent  did
    not set out as one might expect a Tribunal  Judge  to  do  an  analysis
    following a step-by-step Razgar approach.  That  of  itself  would  not
    make this decision not in accordance with the law such that it remained
    outstanding before the Respondent to  take.   The  Appellant  was  well
    aware that her claim had been refused and why it had been refused.

20.  In any event there would not appear to be  any  significant  difference
    between a judicial review finding that a refusal letter was  Wednesbury
    unreasonable for inadequacy of reasons and a finding by a Tribunal in a
    statutory appeal that the  decision  is  unlawful  (for  inadequacy  of
    reasons) and remains  outstanding.   It  is  a  distinction  without  a
    difference.  I do not consider that there  is  any  danger  as  Counsel
    sought to suggest that the Upper Tribunal hearing a case in a statutory
    appeal or the Upper Tribunal  hearing  a  judicial  review  application
    might come to different views.  I  venture  to  suggest  that  if  this
    decision was adequate for the purposes of statutory appeal it would  be
    adequate for the purposes of a judicial review.

21.  It was an error for the Judge to find that  the  Respondent's  decision
    was not in accordance with the law because the Judge  was  mistaken  in
    finding that the Respondent had not  considered  the  exercise  of  her
    discretion.  In those circumstances it was a further error of  law  for
    the Judge not to go on and consider the Article 8 claim herself  rather
    than leave the matter still to be determined by the Respondent.

The Substantive Re-hearing

22.  Having indicated to the parties that  I  found  an  error  of  law  the
    matter proceeded by  way  of  a  re-hearing.   At  the  outset  Counsel
    indicated that the Appellant's mother and brother had been issued  with
    biometric documents and therefore had  lodged  their  applications  for
    indefinite leave to remain.  The Judge's  finding  that  there  was  no
    evidence that the family home in India had been sold  was  disputed  by
    the Appellant. Her father had said in his statement that there  was  no
    property left in India.   The  most  recent  bundle  submitted  by  the
    Appellant for the re-hearing  contained  financial  documents  to  show
    continuing financial and emotional dependence by the Appellant.   There
    were documents in the  original  bundle  submitted  at  first  instance
    including letters from friends and the village elder which  were  still
    relied upon.

23.  The Appellant gave evidence adopting her statement that  she  had  made
    for the first instance proceedings dated 7th July 2015  (which  was  in
    the supplementary bundle).  This had confirmed that she was financially
    and emotionally dependent on her father who was in full-time employment
    and  fully  responsible  for  her  entire   educational,   living   and
    accommodation expenditure in the United Kingdom. His gross  salary  was
    more than �2,250 per month and was paying her �150 by direct debit on a
    regular basis.  It was not possible in India to rent a house on her own
    and live there without her brother or parents.  Her cultural, religious
    and emotional values required the sole responsibility of her biological
    parents until she married. The village elder had written  a  letter  to
    say it was not safe for the Appellant to live without her parents.  She
    had a strong private life in the United Kingdom  having  completed  her
    degree.  She considered the United Kingdom as her home.

24.  She was asked in examination-in-chief to identify  a  document  in  the
    bundle which she said was the English translation of a Punjabi document
    relating to a plot of land in her mother's name which  had  since  been
    sold.  Her  two  paternal  uncles  had  moved  to  Dubai  in  or  about
    2005/2006.  There was no documentary evidence regarding the sale of the
    family home because it was in a village and  it  was  sold  to  a  rich
    person.  There was no accommodation available in India  now.   She  had
    two maternal uncles living in Canada, living with  their  families  but
    she had no contact with them.  Separation  from  her  family  would  be
    unimaginable because she could not live alone.

25.  In cross-examination she said that when her mother was left  behind  in
    India, she had her brother, the Appellant's maternal uncle living  with
    her. She thought she might be able to get a job in India but  life  was
    unsafe in the large cities.  She did not know how frequently attacks on
    women were but she thought there were many.  She had  no  contact  with
    her friends from school in India any longer.  Her  female  friends  had
    since got married.  She had been back to India with her father to  meet
    her mother and brother in 2012 on a four week visit.  They had gone  to
    the same house where her mother and brother were living.   It  was  her
    maternal uncle who had sold the house.  Her uncle had  wanted  to  sell
    the property but her father had asked him to allow the family  to  live
    in the property which he gave permission for.  She had not  used  Skype
    to keep in contact with her friends in India.

Closing Submissions

26.  For the Respondent reliance was placed on the  refusal  letter.   There
    was still no real evidence that the house in India had been sold.   The
    Appellant's evidence amounted to requiring the Tribunal to accept  that
    that had happened "on a nod and a wink".  It was difficult  to  believe
    that there would not be deeds of transfer, otherwise how could a  buyer
    prove that they had bought the land?  The  Appellant  was  now  in  her
    early 20s, she had obtained a degree in Pharmacology and there were  no
    serious obstacles to her reintegration to life in India.  She had  left
    there five years ago but she would be able to form a private  life  and
    obtain employment there.  There was nothing to  support  the  assertion
    that she would be at  risk  as  a  single  woman.   There  was  nothing
    disproportionate about the removal of  the  Appellant.   The  Appellant
    could not meet the Rules. Outside the Rules, on  the  Appellant's  side
    she could speak English and her father was maintaining her  and  paying
    for her education and therefore the Appellant was not a burden  on  the
    state.  However the maintenance  of  immigration  control  was  in  the
    public interest and the appeal should fall for refusal.

27.  In closing for the Appellant reliance was placed on  the  remainder  of
    the skeleton argument.  The Appellant spoke English and had passed  the
    Life  in  the  United  Kingdom  test  such  that  the  public  interest
    consideration was not heightened.  The family and private life  of  the
    Appellant was formed prior to coming to the United  Kingdom  and  there
    were no other factors that would raise the bar of the  public  interest
    in the maintenance of  effective  immigration  control.   The  skeleton
    argument set out seven factors derived from the witness  statements  of
    the Appellant and her parents.  These were: the emotional and financial
    dependence of the Appellant on her  family;  direct  emotional  support
    could not be given to the Appellant if she were to be in India; she had
    been living with her mother and brother in India but  the  family  were
    all present now in the United Kingdom; the family had serious  concerns
    about the appropriateness of the Appellant living in India on her  own;
    the Appellant's father maintained there was no home in  India  for  the
    Appellant to live in and no other relatives to care for her;  she  came
    here when 17 years old and there was no explanation why her application
    for indefinite leave to remain was  refused;  even  if  there  were  no
    significant obstacles preventing her  reintegration  into  India  there
    were many  practical,  psychological  and  cultural  obstacles  to  her
    return.

28.  In oral submissions Counsel argued there  was  no  question  about  the
    credibility of the evidence given.  There was no  documentary  evidence
    of the sale of the property but the Appellant had  given  her  evidence
    again and she should be found credible.  Family life in this  case  and
    dependency did not just end at 18.  She would be on her own  in  India.
    Cultural concerns had to be given weight.

Findings

29.  This is an appeal outside the Immigration Rules.  The Appellant  cannot
    satisfy either  Appendix  FM  (family  life)  or  paragraph  276ADE  in
    relation to private life.  That was acknowledged by the Judge at  first
    instance and no argument has been made to me to indicate that  that  is
    incorrect.  I must therefore consider whether this appeal  succeeds  or
    fails outside the Immigration Rules but looking through  the  prism  of
    the  Rules.   The  Appellant  must  show  that  there  are   compelling
    circumstances in this case should the matter reach the  proportionality
    stage.

30.  The Appellant has a family life with her  father,  mother  and  brother
    who are all in the United Kingdom.  Her father has indefinite leave  to
    remain but neither her mother nor her brother have  such  leave.   They
    have made an application but it has not yet been decided  upon  by  the
    Respondent.  The position might have been different had the  Respondent
    granted indefinite leave to remain to the  other  two  members  of  the
    family, but in the absence of such a grant that  is  not  a  factor  on
    which I place any great weight.  Thus if  the  Appellant's  mother  and
    brother's applications were to be refused by the  Respondent  then  all
    three would return to India together.  Much of the argument put forward
    by the Appellant in this case as to her  personal  circumstances  would
    then fall away.

31.  The Appellant's father is a British citizen who lived the  majority  of
    his life in India before travelling to this country  illegally.   Given
    that the Appellant's mother and brother could return to India now since
    they have not been granted indefinite leave to remain, family  life  in
    this case could be continued elsewhere and the  interference  with  the
    Appellant's family life she has in this country would  be  slight.  The
    interference with such family life would  be  proportionate  as  a  far
    greater weight would be attached to the public interest in  maintaining
    immigration control as the three members of the family referred to have
    no expectation of leave.

32.  In the event that the Respondent granted  the  Appellant's  mother  and
    brother's application for indefinite  leave  to  remain,  the  position
    would then be that the Appellant's removal  to  India  would  interfere
    with her family life as she would go but  they  could  stay.  It  would
    still be pursuant to the legitimate aim of immigration  control,  given
    that the Appellant is an adult whose studies are now complete  and  her
    student leave has expired.  Would the Appellant's removal to India then
    be proportionate to the legitimate aim being  pursued?   The  Appellant
    has a financial dependence on her family since she is not able to work.
     That was a consequence of her limited immigration status as a student.
     If she were to return to India her family were they to remain in  this
    country could continue to financially support her by  remitting  monies
    to her.  In any event the Appellant now has  a  qualification  from  an
    English university  which  would  stand  her  in  very  good  stead  in
    obtaining employment and therefore being self-sufficient  upon  return.
    The issue of financial dependency I find is not a factor to be afforded
    any significant weight.

33.  As to her claim to have an emotional  dependence  on  her  family,  the
    Appellant is an adult in her early 20s and  I  do  not  find  that  her
    relationship with her parents and brother  amounts  to  more  than  the
    normal emotional ties one  would  expect  to  see  in  a  family.   The
    Appellant argues that there is no accommodation available  for  her  to
    live in India citing the fact that the family home was sold.  The Judge
    at first instance did not accept that and there is no  better  evidence
    before me than was before Judge Roopnarine-Davies.  The point  made  by
    the Respondent on this issue is a telling one.   If  the  property  has
    been bought as the Appellant says by a  rich  person,  how  would  that
    person be able to prove ownership without some form of documentation to
    support it?  This Tribunal is familiar with evidence regarding the sale
    of properties in the Indian subcontinent and if it is to be argued that
    a house has been sold legally  with  no  supporting  documentation  one
    would expect to see some background  information  to  support  such  an
    otherwise unusual assertion.

34.  In this case there is no better evidence now  than  there  was  before.
    The Appellant's evidence is that her uncles have sold the property  but
    she herself was not involved in the sale and her evidence on the  point
    is of limited value.  The Appellant relies on a statement made  by  her
    father for the First-tier proceedings (which  has  not  been  updated),
    which states at paragraph 5 "I have  sold  all  my  property  while  my
    family left India".  That statement is to use a phrase employed by  the
    Judge about the refusal letter "terse".  This is a  core  component  of
    the Appellant's claim and it is reasonable to have expected rather more
    detail about it than has in fact emerged.  I do not find that there  is
    evidence to show that the family property in India has  been  sold.   I
    agree with the finding of the First-tier Tribunal on that point.  In my
    view there is accommodation for the Appellant to return to,  it  is  of
    course a matter for her whether she chooses to live in such property or
    to relocate within India, a large and populous country.

35.  There is no background evidence to support the  Appellant's  contention
    that as a single female she would be at particular or indeed any  risk.
    I place little weight on the  letters  said  to  be  from  the  village
    elders, or indeed the assertion that all family members have  now  left
    India.  The letter written by the head of the village  was  dated  25th
    August 2014, some two years after the Appellant's mother's property was
    said to have been sold and some years after other  family  members  had
    left India. This indicated that there  is  still  contact  between  the
    Appellant's family on the one hand and her home village on the other in
    order at the very  least  to  obtain  the  correspondence.   I  do  not
    consider that I have been given  a  full  account  of  the  Appellant's
    family's circumstances in India or indeed who remains there.  I do  not
    accept the contention that  the  Appellant  would  face  insurmountable
    obstacles in returning to her country of origin.  Indeed it is my  view
    that it would be reasonable to expect that she could return.

36.  As to the effect on the other members of the family  in  this  country,
    as I have indicated two at least could in any  event  return  to  India
    should they so wish but failing that could maintain  contact  with  the
    Appellant through visits and modern  means  of  communication.   It  is
    clear from the evidence given by the Appellant she and her family  have
    maintained connections in the past through visits after the Appellant's
    father left India to travel to the United Kingdom.   The  Appellant  is
    not in a relationship in this  country  and  there  are  no  qualifying
    children of relevance. I do not accept the argument that weight  should
    be given to the establishment of a family  life  in  India  before  the
    Appellant came to this country. It is the quality or otherwise  of  the
    family life in this country which is being  measured.  In  my  view  it
    would not be a disproportionate interference with the family  life  the
    Appellant has with her family in this country to refuse her application
    for further leave and to require her to return to India.

37.  Turning to the issue of private life, the Appellant has  only  been  in
    the United Kingdom a relatively short time whilst her status  here  was
    precarious as she had  leave  as  a  student  but  with  no  legitimate
    expectation  that  that  leave  would  be  extended.   The  Appellant's
    argument is that she did not form her private life  whilst  her  status
    here was precarious.  However that is a reference to her  private  life
    in India.  What I am concerned with is the Appellant's  claim  to  have
    established a private life in this country.  Her private life  in  this
    country was established whilst her status here was precarious  as  such
    little weight can be ascribed to it in  the  proportionality  exercise.
    For the reasons which I have given above, the Appellant would not  face
    significant obstacles to her reintegration back into  India.   She  has
    cultural and other ties to India.  Although she produces  letters  from
    friends who know her in this country, it is clear that she  would  have
    friends in India that she knew  from  before.   I  do  not  accept  her
    evidence on the point that she has lost all contact with her friends in
    India.  The Appellant has visited India since she first arrived in this
    country. For the reasons I have given above in  relation  to  both  the
    family  life  and  private  life  claims  there   are   no   compelling
    circumstances in this case such that the Appellant's appeal  should  be
    allowed outside the Immigration Rules. I dismiss the appeal in relation
    to Article 8.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.

I have remade the decision  in  this  case  by  dismissing  the  Appellant's
appeal.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
