                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondent and her immigration appeal  history

   1. The Respondent to whom I shall refer as the Applicant is a citizen  of
      Nigeria born on 27 October 1965.   She  asserts  she  arrived  in  the
      United Kingdom on or about 27 January 1997.  On or about 3 March  2007
      she made an application for indefinite leave based on  long  residency
      and it would appear this application was refused.   She  made  another
      application on or about 15 April 2011 for indefinite  leave  based  on
      fourteen years' continuous residence.

   2. On 15 April 2011 the Respondent refused the  Applicant  leave  finding
      she had not shown she had had  either  ten  years'  continuous  lawful
      residence or  fourteen  years'  continuous  residence  in  the  United
      Kingdom and there was no evidence  she  had  sufficient  knowledge  of
      English language and life  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  notice  of
      decision advised the Applicant she had no basis for remaining  in  the
      United Kingdom and that if she failed voluntarily to leave enforcement
      action would be taken.  The decision did not carry with it  any  right
      of appeal.  The SSHD gave reasons for its decision in a letter of  the
      same date.

   3. No further legal action was taken by the Applicant in relation to that
      decision until 31 May 2011 when her solicitors wrote to the Respondent
      re-asserting the Applicant's entitlement to further leave on the basis
      of long residency and supplying further evidence said to show she  had
      been in the United Kingdom since 1997. There was  no  explanation  why
      such evidence had not or could not have previously been disclosed.

   4. It would appear the SSHD responded by a letter of 4 August 2011 but no
      copy of that letter was put before the Tribunal.  It is referred to in
      a letter of 14 September 2011 from the Applicant's solicitors  to  the
      Respondent noting that the letter of  4  August  2011  maintained  the
      refusal to grant further leave and requesting the Respondent to  issue
      an enforcement decision which would carry with it a right of appeal to
      the Tribunal.

   5. There is no indication in the Tribunal file of  any  further  activity
      until a letter of 9 January 2013 sent by the SSHD to the Applicant  or
      her solicitors.  No copy of it was before the Tribunal.  Its existence
      is evidenced by a reference to it in a letter of 28 October 2013  sent
      by the Applicant to the Respondent in respect of which it would appear
      from the tenor of the letter that she had received legal advice.   The
      letter refers to the failure of the Respondent to issue an enforcement
      notice and to enclosing further evidence to show she had been  in  the
      United Kingdom since 1997.  The additional evidence submitted is  said
      to be fully listed at paragraph 6  of  the  skeleton  argument  of  Mr
      Slatter put before the First-tier Tribunal Judge. Again, there was  no
      explanation why such evidence had not or  could  not  have  previously
      been disclosed.

   6. A decision to remove the Applicant to Nigeria was made on 28  November
      2013. The Applicant challenge this decision which carried with  it  an
      out of country right by lodging in-country a  notice  of  appeal:  the
      validity of which must be open to doubt.

   7. The next development referred to by Mr Slatter was a letter  from  the
      Respondent to the Applicant's solicitors of which there is no copy  in
      the Tribunal file, although it is referred to  in  the  letter  of  20
      January 2014 in reply at page A1 of the SSHD's bundle.  This  enclosed
      what are described  as  "Grounds  of  Appeal/Statement  of  Additional
      Grounds".   The Grounds start by asserting they  are  Grounds  for  an
      Appeal against an Enforcement Notice which would appear to  have  been
      served under cover of the letter of 14 January.  There is no  need  to
      consider them in depth because on 23 January 2014 the Respondent wrote
      to the Applicant's solicitors withdrawing the enforcement  notice  and
      enclosing a further enforcement notice dated 23 January  which  is  in
      form IS.151A. The notice simply informs the Applicant she is a  person
      liable to removal and to detention pending  the  decision  whether  to
      give removal directions.  Such notices are not  immigration  decisions
      having a right to an appeal to the Tribunal under Section  82  of  the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  as  amended  (the  2002
      Act).

   8. On 24 January 2014  the  SSHD  wrote  to  the  Applicant's  solicitors
      confirming  that  their  earlier  letters  and  enclosures  had   been
      considered as further representations  and  explaining  why  the  SSHD
      would not grant the Appellant further leave to  remain.   This  letter
      accompanied a Notice of Decision of the same date giving the Applicant
      an in-country right of appeal.

   9. The Applicant lodged notice of appeal  against  the  24  January  2014
      decision.  The Grounds are identical  (including  the  then  incorrect
      reference to the date of the decision as 28 November  2013)  to  those
      originally submitted under cover of a letter of 9 December  2013  from
      the Applicant's solicitors.  The Grounds assert the  appeal  is  based
      exclusively  on  issues  arising  under  Article  8  of  the  European
      Convention asserting the Applicant should have an in-country right  of
      appeal.  The decision of 24 January 2014 gave  the  Applicant  an  in-
      country right of appeal.  The other assertions in the Grounds are that
      the Applicant had:-

         Previously made an application  and  representations  to  the  Home
         Office  on  the  basis   of   her   long   residence   ....   those
         representations dated 1  March  2011  and  14  September  2011  are
         enclosed for your attention.

  10.  Mr  Slatter  did  not  refer  to  the  decisions  and  correspondence
      subsequent to 20 January 2014.

  11. He asserted the Applicant had established a sufficient  nexus  between
      the immigration decision under appeal and her claim under Article 8 to
      entitle her to an in-country right of appeal.  He relied on  paragraph
      10 of the judgment in BA (Nigeria) v  SSHD  [2009]  EWCA  Civ.119  and
      noted that indeed the Applicant had been given an in-country right  of
      appeal in the decision of 24 January 2014.

  12. This led him to submit that the 2011 decision  was  unlawful  and  the
      SSHD had made a fresh decision with an in-country right of  appeal  in
      January 2014 but the relevant law to be applied was to be at the  date
      of her application in 2011.

  13. He continued that the Judge had been correct to apply  the  provisions
      of the pre-10 July  2012  version  of  paragraph  276ADE  because  the
      application had been made in 2011  and  so  had  the  benefit  of  the
      transitional provisions. The Judge had therefore been correct to apply
      the previous version of paragraph 276 and the  determination  did  not
      contain a material error of law.



Findings and Consideration

  14. The Applicant claimed the SSHD's decision on 15 April 2011  to  refuse
      her further leave without a right of appeal was unlawful.  The  letter
      of 15 April 2011 giving the SSHD's reasons for refusing the  Applicant
      further leave addressed any potential claim she might have  had  based
      on Article 8 of the Immigration Rules.  Sedley LJ said:-

         .... On a purely  literal  construction  of  Section  92(4)(a)  any
         historic asylum  or  human  rights  claim  gave  an  in-country  or
         suspensive right of appeal - failed because it  would  lead  to  an
         inexplicable and arbitrary distinction between individuals who were
         similarly placed.  It followed that, although not spelt out,  there
         had to be a nexus between the immigration  decision  against  which
         the appeal was directed and the content of the  initial  claim  for
         protection.

    It would appear there was sufficient nexus  which  indeed  the  reasons
    letter of 15 April 2011 recognised.  Mr  Slatter's  argument  continued
    that consequently the 2011 decision was unlawful. There was no evidence
    of any threat or attempt to challenge this decision for example by  way
    of judicial review.  The solicitor's letter of 31  May  2011  enclosing
    further evidence and seeking reconsideration  made  no  suggestion  the
    April decision was unlawful nor was  any  attempt  made  to  appeal  or
    challenge it.  There  was  no  submission  to  the  Tribunal  that  the
    Applicant had attempted to appeal it or to seek judicial review.

14.  It appears that by a letter of 4 August 2011 the  SSHD  maintained  its
    position.  No copy of this letter before the  Tribunal.  On  9  January
    2013 the Applicant's  solicitors  submitted  further  evidence  of  the
    Applicant's claimed long  residence  and  requested  the  issue  of  an
    enforcement order in the expectation that it would grant the  Applicant
    an in-country right of appeal.  The decision to remove of  28  November
    2013 did not carry an in-country right of appeal but did carry  an  out
    of country right of appeal.  Again there was  no  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal of any attempt to challenge  this  2013  decision  by  way  of
    judicial review.

15. The Applicant finally was given an in-country right of appeal by reason
    of the decision of 24 January 2014 being the decision  leading  to  the
    present appeal.  The law to be applied is the law as at the date of the
    decision: see Odelola v SSHD [2009] UKHL 25. The  Applicant's  case  is
    that the  decision  of  January  2014  was  made  in  response  to  her
    application of April 2011 and so was entitled to  the  benefit  of  the
    transitional provisions.

16. On the balance of probabilities the SSHD's letter of 4 August 2011  and
    the Applicant's letter of 14 September 2011 requesting the issue of  an
    enforcement  notice  but  probably  meaning  removal  directions  or  a
    decision to make them effectively disposed of the 2011 application.

17. The letter of 14 September did not make  any  other  challenge  to  the
    April decision or its lawfulness. I am fortified  in  my  view  by  the
    lapse of time before the Applicant took any further  action  which  was
    not until 9 January 2013, over 15 months later and even then it was not
    until 20  January  2014,  when  another  year  had  passed,  until  the
    Applicant renewed or rather re-commenced her efforts to  obtain  status
    in the United Kingdom.  The reliance in the letter of 20  January  2014
    upon information given to the SSHD in 2011 is in all the circumstances,
    particularly the periods of inactivity on the part of the Applicant and
    the failure on the  part  of  the  Applicant  to  appeal  or  otherwise
    challenge any of  the  SSHD's  earlier  decisions,  not  sufficient  to
    support the submission that  the  letter  of  20  January  2014  was  a
    continuation  of  the  2011   application.   It   amounted   to   fresh
    representations which the SSHD treated as a new application leading  to
    the decision of 24 January 2014 giving rise to the subject appeal.

18. The conclusion is that the Judge made an error of law in proceeding  on
    the basis that the application leading to the decision under appeal had
    been made in 2011 and not 2014. Consequently, his decision must be  set
    aside in its entirety without any findings being preserved. The case is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing afresh in  accordance
    with Section 12(2)(b) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007
    and paragraph 7.2 of the Upper  Tribunal's  Practice  Statement  of  10
    February 2010 as amended.

Anonymity

16. There was no request for  an  anonymity  order  and  having  heard  the
    application and considered the papers in the Tribunal file I find  that
    none is warranted.

Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law and is set aside in its entirety and the appeal is remitted to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh  before  any  Judge  other  than
    Judge Dennis.

    Anonymity order not made.
