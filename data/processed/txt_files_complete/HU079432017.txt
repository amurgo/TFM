Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Sarker (counsel) instructed by M-R Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge  Housego  promulgated  on  25/06/2018,  which  dismissed  the
Appellant's appeal on all grounds.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 20/12/1981 and is a national of Bangladesh.  On
06/06/2017 the Secretary of State refused the  Appellant's  application  for
further leave to remain in the UK.


The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Housego ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision. Grounds of appeal were lodged and  on  02/10/2018  Tribunal  Judge
Hollingworth gave permission to appeal stating

    "It is arguable that the Judge has not set out a sufficient analysis of
    the available evidence provided on behalf of the appellant in  relation
    to the state of the health care system in Bangladesh  set  against  the
    medical history of the appellant and the  question  of  the  degree  of
    obstacles arising pursuant to the criteria  in  the  immigration  rules
    taking into account the location to which the appellant was  to  return
    in Bangladesh. At paragraph 50 of the  decision  the  Judge  refers  to
    medication for heart problems being available in Bangladesh. There  are
    hospitals in Dhaka which provided care for those with  heart  problems.
    Having made these findings of fact the Judge went on  to  consider  the
    reasons for the findings of fact and conclusions. In the  analysis  set
    out under the heading "reasons for findings of  fact  and  conclusions"
    the Judge dealt with the article 8 claim shorn of its medical  element.
    The Judge dealt with article 3. At paragraph 54 the Judge  went  on  to
    refer to the facts not breaching the Secretary of State's  policy.  The
    Judge referred to the submissions in the context of the wider article 8
    consideration. The Judge stated  that  the  appellant  had  no  present
    medical needs. His medical needs had been met. The Judge  continued  by
    stating that he now needs medication and not to smoke.  He  lives  with
    ischaemic heart disease.  The  appellant  has  no  other  treatment  at
    present. The Judge then concluded at paragraph 55 that there  were  not
    very significant obstacles to the reintegration of the  appellant  into
    life in Bangladesh. It is arguable that the Judge has  not  set  out  a
    sufficient analysis under the heading "reasons for findings of fact and
    conclusions" of the available  medical  evidence  in  relation  to  the
    issues arising from the appellant living with ischaemic  heart  disease
    before reaching the conclusion set out at paragraph 55 of the decision.
    Further, it is arguable that more weight should have been  attached  to
    the period of time spent in the United Kingdom by the appellant in  his
    role as a student. It is arguable that compelling circumstances existed
    requiring a proportionality exercise to be undertaken  in  relation  to
    the question of whether there would be a breach of  article  8  outside
    the rules attributing more weight to the period  spent  in  the  United
    Kingdom and the appellant's role as a student."

The Hearing
5. (a) For the appellant, Mr Sarker moved the grounds of appeal. He told  me
that although there are 12 grounds of appeal, he would group them under  two
headings

    (i)    a failure to take account of medical evidence  in  carrying  out
    the article 8 proportionality exercise, &






    (ii)   a failure to give the appellant credit for the length of time he
    was a bona fide student in the UK.

(b)  Mr Sarker told me that the was a  wealth  of  medical  evidence  placed
before the Judge which, he says, the Judge ignored.  He  told  me  that  the
Judge's error is that there was neither sufficient analysis of the  evidence
of the availability of health care in Bangladesh nor of  the  corrupt  state
of health care system in Bangladesh. He told me  that  there  is  inadequate
provision for the appellant's health needs in Bangladesh and that the  Judge
had failed to take account of clear evidence of failings in the health  care
system in Bangladesh.

(c) Mr Sarker told me  that  the  appellant  suffers  from  ischaemic  heart
disease, and is permanently at risk of fatal heart attack. At  [52]  of  the
decision the  Judge  sets  consideration  of  the  medical  aspects  of  the
appellants case aside before considering article 8. He told me that that  is
a clear error of law and that the appellant's illness & need  for  treatment
is a crucial part of his overall article 8 claim.

(d) Mr Sarker told me that the appellant entered the UK  as  a  student  and
pursued studies until 2016. He told me that the Judge  failed  to  take  the
appellant's activities in the UK into account and placed too  much  emphasis
on section 117B of the 2002 Act. He  told  me  that,  overall,  the  Judge's
article 8 assessment is flawed. He asked me to set the decision aside.

6. For the respondent Mr Bramble told me that the decision does not  contain
errors, material or otherwise. He told me  that  the  Judge  has  written  a
carefully structured decision in which he takes account of  each  strand  of
evidence. He told  me  that  the  Judge  considered  the  medical  evidence,
consider the appellant's illness and his need for  treatment,  and  factored
those considerations into the overall article 8 assessment. He told me  that
the Judge correctly directed himself in law before reaching a decision  well
within the range of reasonable conclusions.  He  urged  me  to  dismiss  the
appeal and allow the decision to stand.

Analysis

7. At [7] of the decision, the Judge records  that  the  respondent  accepts
the appellant has been in the UK for  9ï¿½  years  and  has  a  serious  heart
condition. Between  [8]  and  [11]  the  Judge  summarises  the  appellant's
position. Between [12] and [20] the Judge correctly directs himself in law.

8. At [21] and [22] the Judge lists the  documentary  evidence  before  him,
including a letter from a doctor in Bangladesh  about  the  availability  of
treatment and the problems within the  health  care  system  in  Bangladesh.
After recording submissions, the Judge summarises the  appellant's  position
between [28] and [32]. The Judge's findings start at [38]  (even  though  he
describes [38] to [43] as "observations on the appellant's case").  At  [45]
the Judge finds  that  the  appellant  has  had  two  heart  operations  and
suffered acute myocardial infarction in 2012. At [50] the Judge  finds  that
there are hospitals in Dhaka which provide coronary care.

9. The appellant misreads [52] of the decision. In  the  first  sentence  of
[52] the Judge  declares  that  he  considers  aspects  of  the  appellant's
article 8 claim over and above the appellant's  illness  and  his  need  for
medication care and treatment. From [53] the Judge carries out an article  3
and 8 assessment taking full account of the appellant's health and his  care
needs. The Judge takes correct guidance in law.  At  [60]  the  Judge  finds
that the appellant's circumstances do not  cross  the  threshold  to  engage
article 3. That finding is not challenged (and is unassailable on the  facts
as the Judge found them to be). The Judge goes on to find that, even  taking
account of the appellant's illness and care needs, the  decision  is  not  a
disproportionate interference with  the  right  to  respect  for  article  8
private life.

10. This case is only about article 8 private life. The appellant  does  not
have family in the UK.
11. In N v UK Application 26565/05 the Grand Chamber upheld the decision  of
the House of Lords and said that in medical cases Article 3 only applied  in
very exceptional circumstances particularly as the  suffering  was  not  the
result of an intentional act or omission of a State or non-State body.   The
European court of Human Rights said that Article 3 could not  be  relied  on
to address the disparity in medical care between Contracting States and  the
applicant's state of origin.  The  fact  that  the  person's  circumstances,
including his or her life expectancy, would  be  significantly  reduced  was
not sufficient in itself to give rise to a breach of Article 3.  Those  same
principles had  to  apply  in  relation  to  the  expulsion  of  any  person
afflicted with any serious, naturally occurring physical or  mental  illness
which might cause suffering pain or reduced  life  expectancy  and  required
specialist medical treatment that might not be readily  available  or  which
might only be available at considerable cost.  Notably the court  held  that
no separate issues arose under Article 8(2) in that case and so it  was  not
even necessary to consider the  Claimant's  submission  that  would  removal
would engage her right to respect for private life.
12. In MM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2012]
EWCA Civ 279  the Court of Appeal noted that the courts had declined to  say
that Article 8 could never by engaged by the health consequences of  removal
but they had never found such a breach and had not been  able  to  postulate
circumstances in which such a breach was likely to be established. The  only
cases where the absence of adequate medical  treatment  in  the  country  to
which a person is to be deported would be relevant to Article  8  are  those
where it is an additional factor to be weighed in  the  balance  with  other
factors that engaged Article 8 (paras 17 - 23). This approach  was  endorsed
by Laws LJ in GS(India) and Others 2015 EWCA Civ 40 (para 86).

13. What is argued for the appellant is a  comparison  of  the  quality  and
availability of health care in the UK against the quality  and  availability
of health care in Bangladesh. An economic argument is also advanced  because
the appellant says he cannot afford healthcare in  Bangladesh.  It  is  well
settled that the "better v worse" prism is the wrong approach in law.

14. In GS (India); EO (Ghana); GM (India); PL (Jamaica); BA (Ghana)  and  KK
(DRC) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 40 it was held that  if  the  Article  3  claim
failed, Article 8 could not prosper  without  some  separate  or  additional
factual element which brought the case within the Article  8  paradigm:  the
core value protected being the quality of life, not  its  continuance.  That
meant that a specific case must  be  made  under  Article  8.  At paragraph
111, Underhill LJ said

    "First, the absence or inadequacy  of  medical  treatment,  even  life-
    preserving treatment, in the country of return, cannot be relied on  at
    all as a factor engaging Article 8: if that is all there is, the  claim
    must fail. Secondly, where Article 8 is engaged by other  factors,  the
    fact that the claimant is receiving medical treatment in  this  country
    which may not be available in the country of return may be a factor  in
    the proportionality exercise; but that factor cannot be treated  as  by
    itself giving rise to a breach since  that  would  contravene  the  'no
    obligation to treat' principle."

15. The Judge considers the appellant's article 8 case taking account  of  a
combination of the appellant's medical condition and  the  other  components
of article 8 private life. He is correct to do  so.  The  caselaw  rehearsed
above indicates that if there was only a medical aspect to this appeal,  the
appellant could not succeed on article 8 private life grounds.

16. The Judge considers paragraph 276ADE of the rules.   In  SSHD  v  Kamara
[2016] EWCA Civ 813 it was held that  the  concept  of  integration  into  a
country was a broad one.  It was not confined to the mere ability to find  a
job or sustain life whilst living in the other country.   It  would  usually
be sufficient for a  court  or  tribunal  to  direct  itself  in  the  terms
Parliament had chosen to use.  The idea of "integration" called for a  broad
evaluative judgment to be made as to whether the individual would be  enough
of an insider in terms of understanding how life  in  the  society  in  that
other country was carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so  as  to
have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be  able  to  operate
on a day-to-day basis in that society and to build up  within  a  reasonable
time a variety of human relationships to give substance to the  individual's
private and family life.

17. In the case of Sanambar v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1284 the Court of  Appeal
said that consideration of the issue of obstacles  to  integration  requires
consideration of all relevant factors some of which might  be  described  as
generic.   Factors  such  as   intelligence,   employability   and   general
robustness of character could clearly be relevant to that issue.  The  broad
evaluation required could also include the extent to which a  parent's  ties
might assist with integration.

18. On the facts  as  the  Judge  found  them  to  be  there  are  not  very
significant obstacles to the  appellant's  integration  in  Bangladesh.  The
Judge found that there is  health  care  and  medication  available  to  the
appellant in Bangladesh. The quality of medication care  and  treatment  may
not be to the standard found in the UK; It may not  be  as  easy  to  access
medication care  and  treatment  in  Bangladesh,  but  medication  care  and
treatment  exist  in  Bangladesh.   The   appellant   is   an   intelligent,
resourceful, educated man who has spent most  of  his  life  in  Bangladesh.
Those findings, made by the Judge, fully support the Judge's conclusions.

19. The appellant cannot meet the requirements  of  the  immigration  rules.
The appellant is not a father,  he  does  not  have  a  partner,  he  is  an
independent adult. The appellant cannot meet the  requirements  of  appendix
FM. Because of the length of time that the appellant has been in the UK  and
his age he does not meet the  requirements  of  paragraph  276  ADE  of  the
rules.

20. The Judge clearly carries out an article  8  proportionality  assessment
outside the rules. The Judge correctly directs himself in law.  The  Judge's
findings  of  fact  and  his  conclusions  are  well  within  the  range  of
reasonable conclusions available to the judge.

 21. In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC)  the
Tribunal held that (i) Although there is  a  legal  duty  to  give  a  brief
explanation of the conclusions on the central issue on which  an  appeal  is
determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole
makes sense, having regard to the  material  accepted  by  the  judge;  (ii)
Although a decision may contain an error of law where  the  requirements  to
give adequate reasons are not met, the Upper  Tribunal  would  not  normally
set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  where  there  has  been  no
misdirection of law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised  and  the
relevant  Country  Guidance  has  been  taken  into  account,   unless   the
conclusions the judge draws from the primary data were not  reasonably  open
to him or her.

22. A fair reading of the decision demonstrates that the Judge  applied  the
correct test in law. The Judge carried out a holistic assessment of  all  of
the  evidence.  There  is  nothing  wrong  with  the  Judge's   fact-finding
exercise. In reality the appellant's appeal amounts to little  more  than  a
disagreement with the way the Judge has applied the facts as he  found  them
to be. The appellant might not like the conclusion that  the  Judge  arrived
at, but that conclusion  is  the  result  of  the  correctly  applied  legal
equation. The correct test in law has been applied. The  decision  does  not
contain a material error of law.

23.   The decision does not contain a material error  of  law.  The  Judge's
decision stands.

DECISION

The  appeal  is  dismissed.  The  decision  of  the   First-tier   Tribunal,
promulgated on 25 June 2018, stands.

Signed
