For the respondent:    Mr S Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Pacey  promulgated  3.8.15,  dismissing  their  appeals   against   the
    decisions of the Secretary of State, dated  24.2.15,  to  refuse  their
    applications for leave to remain in the UK on human rights grounds  and
    to remove them from the UK pursuant to section 47  of  the  Immigration
    Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    23.7.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Molloy  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    4.12.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 22.1.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below I find no material error of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Pacey to be set aside.

 5. The grounds of appeal are rather confused and difficult  to  follow.  I
    also found Mr Talacchi's submissions rather difficult to follow as they
    did not seem to relate  directly  to  the  issues  in  the  appeal.  In
    particular, I fail to understand in what way it is submitted  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge made "unreasonable credibility findings."  In
    granting  permission  on  a  different  ground,  Judge  Molloy  refused
    permission to appeal on this ground and it need not be taken further.

 6. Judge  Molloy  also  refused  permission  in  relation  to  the  ground
    challenging, on grounds of failure to provide sufficient  reasons,  the
    finding at �12 of the decision that the appellants  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM, for the reasons set out in  the  Secretary
    of State's refusal decision.

 7. The only arguable ground of appeal is in relation to the brevity of the
    judge's statement at �15 of the decision that there were "no compelling
    or compassionate circumstances to  enable  me  to  consider  article  8
    outside the Rules." In granting permission Judge Molloy  considered  it
    arguable that this was "insufficiently reasoned in  that  there  is  no
    reference to either the Razgar five steps or  the  section  117  duty."
    With respect to Judge Molloy, if there are no compelling  circumstances
    to justify consideration of private and family life outside  the  Rules
    under article 8 ECHR, there is  no  purpose  in  re-stating  Razgar  or
    making reference to section 117B of the 2002, which,  as  section  117A
    makes clear only applies when article 8 is to be considered.

 8. It is perhaps important to understand the  background  and  recall  the
    nature of the application made to the Secretary of State on 30.12.14.

 9. The first appellant came to the UK as  a  student  in  2008.  His  wife
    joined him as a student dependent in 2010. Their leave was subsequently
    extended as student and dependent  to  1.1.15.  On  30.12.14  and  thus
    within extant leave, they applied for leave to remain on the  basis  of
    private and family life. The application form makes it clear  that  the
    first appellant wanted to carry on studying in the UK. However, he  did
    not make an application for leave to remain as a  student.  Indeed,  he
    was unable to do so for the reasons set out in his grounds  of  appeal,
    that the Rules do not permit him to apply for further study at the same
    level as his previous qualifications  and  study.  His  last  sponsor's
    licence was revoked  and  he  claimed  that  he  needed  more  time  to
    "finalize my qualification." In evidence to the First-tier Tribunal  he
    said that he was not currently studying as he had completed  an  online
    Masters degree with Anglia Ruskin University the previous month and now
    wanted to do a MBA.

10. Thus there was  no  student  application.  Neither  did  he  raise  any
    suggestion that he had  not  had  time  to  obtain  a  new  educational
    sponsor, an argument that Mr Talacchi  appeared  to  raise,  suggesting
    that the decision of the Secretary of State was unfair. He also  sought
    to rely on the case of Abbasi  and  another  (visits  -  bereavement  -
    Article 8) [2015] UKUT 463, suggesting that this case was akin to  that
    as the first appellant was seeking leave  for  a  specific  purpose.  I
    reject that argument as plainly nonsense. The only application made and
    considered on form FLR(O) was for leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of
    private and family life. Whilst the first appellant wished to  continue
    studying, he knew that he could not meet the requirements of the  Rules
    for  leave  to  remain  as  a  student,  whether  or  not  he  obtained
    educational sponsorship. The reasons he gave in his grounds  of  appeal
    had been fulfilled and  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  he  was  clearly
    seeking to embark on further study. Knowing he could not meet the Rules
    he made the only application he could, for leave to remain on the basis
    of private and family life.

11. That application was properly considered and  refused  for  very  clear
    reasons. The appellants could not meet the requirements of Appendix  FM
    in relation to family life and there were no very significant obstacles
    to integration on return to Sri Lanka, as the first appellant  accepted
    at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing. At  �13  Judge  Pacey  found
    that it was only for reasons of convenience that they did not  wish  to
    return to Sri Lanka, but they were perfectly able to do so  and  indeed
    he declared that was his intention, once he had  completed  studies  in
    the UK.

12. In essence, the appellants were seeking to remain as  students  through
    an alternative route of private and  family  life.  There  was  nothing
    compelling, compassionate or exceptional about their circumstances  and
    thus at �15 Judge Pacey said as much, justifying why the judge did need
    to go on to consider article 8 ECHR outside the Rules. This  course  of
    action is now well established as good law by the Court  of  Appeal  in
    the case of Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 74, where it was held that  there  is
    no need to conduct a full separate examination of article 8 outside the
    Rules where, in the circumstances, of a particular case, all the issues
    have been addressed in the consideration under the Rules.

13. I find absolutely no error of law in the decision of  Judge  Pacey.  Mr
    Talacchi was unable to point me to any circumstances of the  appellants
    that could properly be described as compelling. Even if there had  been
    a reasoned article 8  ECHR  assessment  following  the  Razgar  stepped
    approach, I fail to see  how  it  could  ever  be  concluded  that  the
    decision  of  the  Secretary   of   State   was   disproportionate   or
    unjustifiably harsh so as to justify granting leave to  remain  outside
    the Rules.

Conclusion & Decision

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal  of  each  appellant  remains  dismissed  on  all
                    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed.
