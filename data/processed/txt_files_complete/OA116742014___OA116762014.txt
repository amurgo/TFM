Representation:
For the Appellant:     The Entry Clearance Officer, Mr Jarvis, Senior
Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    By their father, Dr Olubunmi Alaba Awoniyi


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The question in these appeals is whether First-tier Tribunal Judge  Row
    was correct in law in allowing the appeals under the Immigration  Rules
    against the Entry Clearance Officer's decisions dated 10 September 2014
    refusing the respondents' applications for entry clearance as returning
    residents to the United Kingdom under paragraph 18 of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 2. The judge accepted that  the  respondents  (the  claimants)  could  not
    succeed as returning residents because they had  never  previously  had
    indefinite leave to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  when  they
    last left.  This is  uncontroversial;  it  was  not  suggested  in  the
    applications or argued before the judge that  the  claimants  had  been
    previously in the United Kingdom other than on a temporary basis.

 3. Having reached this conclusion, the judge asked whether  the  claimants
    could nevertheless succeed  under  paragraph  297  which  provides  for
    indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom inter alia as the child of
    a parent, present and settled or being admitted  for  settlement  here.
    He concluded that the claimants met the paragraph 297 provisions and on
    this basis allowed the appeal, indicating that in such circumstances it
    was unnecessary for him to consider the matter under Article 8.

 4. After hearing argument from Mr Jarvis and representations  made  by  Dr
    Awoniyi, we gave our decision at the hearing that the  judge  had  been
    incorrect to allow the appeal.  But in all  the  circumstances  of  the
    case, we decided not to  set  aside  the  decision  so  exercising  our
    discretion under s 12(2) (a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement
    Act 2007.

 5. The background to the appeals is as follows.  The  twin  claimants  are
    nationals of Nigeria where they were born in May 1997.  Their father is
    a British citizen and lives in Wolverhampton.   He  is  employed  as  a
    psychiatrist by Dudley & Walsall Partnership NHS Trust.  In August 2014
    at the time the applications for  Entry  Clearance  were  made  he  was
    earning net of tax ï¿½5,300 per month and he  lived  alone  in  a  three-
    bedroomed house.

 6. The claimants' mother was killed in an aeroplane crash in 2000.  It was
    decided that they would be raised by their father's mother in  Nigeria,
    but she passed away in June 2014.  They visited  their  father  in  the
    United Kingdom on occasions in 2001 and 2004, the longest period  being
    between 20 November 2004 and 9 July 2005.  The death of their  paternal
    grandmother led to the applications and these appeals.

 7. The applications were made  on-line  with  "Returning  Resident"  being
    selected as the purpose and type  of  application  being  made  and  so
    attracted a fee for each of US$494.  The  correct  immigration  history
    was given and  as  well,  reference  was  made  to  the  death  of  the
    claimants' paternal grandmother in June 2014, the  frequency  of  their
    father's visits to Nigeria 3-4 times a year and the  claimants'  desire
    to live with him on a permanent basis.

 8. A feature of the process was that the claimants were also  required  to
    complete in manuscript forms described as Appendix 1 (BAF4A July  2012)
    Family Settlement & Family Reunion.   In  addition,  their  father  was
    required to  complete  sponsorship  undertakings  in  respect  of  both
    children and he was also  required  to  fill  out  a  further  document
    described   as   "Settlement/Returning   Resident/EEA   Family   Permit
    Categories List".  We observed at the hearing that it was not clear why
    this was needed as a returning resident would need only to  demonstrate
    (i) that he had indefinite leave when he last left, (ii)  that  he  had
    not been  away  for  more  than  two  years,  (iii)  had  not  received
    assistance from public funds towards the costs of leaving and (iv)  was
    seeking admission for the purpose of settlement.

 9. Mr Jarvis explained that these documents were required to be  completed
    in order for the Entry Clearance Officer  to  consider  any  Article  8
    aspect.  He readily accepted that but for the fee the claimants met all
    the requirements of paragraph 297.  But it was not open  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to rectify matters by calling for a top-up of the fee
    paid; the system did not permit this.

10. Despite this purpose, the immigration decisions for both claimants make
    no reference at all to the supplementary material and focus  solely  on
    the inability of the failure to  meet  the  requirements  at  paragraph
    18(i) and (ii):

         '18.  person seeking to enter the United  Kingdom  as  a  returning
         resident may be admitted for settlement  provided  the  immigration
         officer is satisfied that the person concerned:

          i) had indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United  Kingdom
             when he last left; and

         ii) has not been away from the United Kingdom for  more  than  two
             years; and

         ...'

11. We note that the Entry Clearance Manager in his appeal review explained
    that he had considered the decision to refuse entry clearance with  due
    regard for human rights legislation and in particular  Article  8.   He
    considered the decisions were correct in law and in proportion  to  the
    maintenance of affected immigration  control.   There  was  no  evident
    analysis of the supplementary material.

12. It is not disputed that the Entry Clearance  Officer  was  entitled  to
    refuse the applications made under the rules; the claimants  had  asked
    to enter as returning residents not for settlement as dependants  under
    paragraph 297.

13. Paragraph 30 provides:

         'An application for an entry clearance is not made  until  any  fee
         required to be paid under the Consular Fees Act 1980 (including any
         regulations or orders made under that Act) has been paid.'

14. The judge was required to decide if the decisions  were  in  accordance
    with the law including immigration rules (s86 of the 2002 Act in  force
    at the date of the decisions in these appeals). As no valid application
    had been made under paragraph 297, the judged  erred  in  allowing  the
    appeals under the Immigration Rules as plainly the  decisions  were  in
    accordance with the relevant rule.

15. The judge explained that he had taken  into  account  SZ  (  Applicable
    immigration rules) [2007] UKAIT 37, a case in which it  was  held  that
    the FtT had erred by not considering paragraph 297 even though  it  had
    not been raised.  The grounds of appeal in the cases before us make  it
    clear that the claimants' father wanted them to  live  with  him  on  a
    permanent basis and that he could afford to do so as indicated  by  the
    documents produced.  As was made clear in SZ (at [11]) however that the
    tribunal is not the primary decision maker; the focus of  enquiry  must
    always be on the basis upon which  the  application  was  made.  If  an
    appellant asserts a different basis that is properly  a  matter  for  a
    fresh application. It is correct that at [16] the Upper Tribunal in  SZ
    considered that there would occasionally be situations for the tribunal
    to consider and apply another rule but  in  the  cases  before  us  the
    applications had been unambiguously made for  returning  residents  and
    did not meet the requirements  of  the  rules.  There  was  nothing  to
    inhibit the making of fresh applications to rectify matters.

16. Mr Jarvis was commendably candid in accepting that paragraph 297  would
    have been met but for the fee. There  is  no  explanation  why,  having
    regard to the purpose behind  the  supplementary  material,  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer did not consider  the  human  rights  impact  of  the
    applications and,  significantly,  he  gave  no  consideration  to  the
    claimants' best interests. As we have observed, there was  no  detailed
    analysis by the Entry Clearance Manager despite the matters  raised  in
    the grounds of appeal.

17. There is no suggestion that there was any deception by the claimants or
    their father and it is plain that the applications were made in  error.
    We have no doubt that had Dr Awoniyi taken  advice,  valid,  successful
    applications would have been made. These cases concern  minors  at  the
    relevant time and any factual consideration is fixed by s85 of the 2002
    Act.  Taking  all  these  factors  into  account   we   consider   that
    exceptionally and on the particular undisputed facts  of  these  cases,
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  although  erroneous  does  not
    require to be set aside.  Accordingly the  appeal  by  Entry  Clearance
    Officer is dismissed with the consequence  that  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal stands.
