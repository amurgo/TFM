                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    This is an appeal by someone who claimed to be  a  citizen  of  Sierra
      Leone against the decision of an adjudicator, Mr J G Peart, sitting at
      Taylor House on 20 February 2003 dismissing his appeal against removal
      directions as an illegal entrant given  on  1  November  2002.     The
      appeal was listed on  that  day  before  the  adjudicator  as  a  full
      hearing,  on  the  basis  of  a  reply  to  directions  given  by  the
      appellant's solicitors (G Singh, Ealing) at an earlier stage.

2.    Nevertheless,  when  the  case  came  before  the  adjudicator  on  20
      February, he was faced with a letter from those  solicitors  dated  19
      February saying that they neither had instructions from the  appellant
      nor were in funds and so had not been able to instruct  counsel.  They
      went on:  "Our client was supposed to attend our office at 4 pm today.
       He has informed us that he  is  not  feeling  well  and  he  will  be
      forwarding a medical certificate to the  court".   There  was  also  a
      medical certificate faxed to the appellate authority on the  very  day
      of the hearing at 11.40 from Dr  A Khatri giving the appellant's  name
      and address and certifying that he "is not  feeling  well,  depressed,
      backache, chest pain, anxious, insomnia, not  feeling  fit  to  attend
      court today".

3.    The adjudicator proceeded with the  hearing  in  the  absence  of  the
      appellant and his solicitors and with those two documents in front  of
      him, we have no doubt whatsoever that he was entitled to  do  so.   We
      note that the GP went no further than to say that  the  appellant  was
      not feeling [our emphasis] fit to attend court on the day in question:
      clearly he did not hazard his own professional opinion on  the  point,
      and  we  think  with  good  reason.  None  of  the  claimed  symptoms,
      separately  or  together,  would  in  our  view  have   justified   an
      adjournment.

4.    The appellant was quite remarkably  fortunate  to  get  permission  to
      appeal on the basis he did.  The correctness of that view has been  to
      a considerable extent borne out by a faxed letter which the solicitors
      sent us when we made enquiries as to why there had been no  appearance
      before us.

      We refer to the above matter and wish to  confirm  that  we  have  not
      received any instructions from Mr Baniyan.  We had sent him  a  letter
      by recorded delivery on 24th June 2003 informing him about the hearing
      on 19th August and have tried to contact him several  times  and  have
      not got any response from him.  In the light of the above  we  request
      the learned adjudicator to decide the appeal on the papers.

5.    The reference to "the learned adjudicator", when the  solicitors  must
      have been aware that there was to be a hearing  before  the  Tribunal,
      rather leads us to suppose that they are making a habit of  this  kind
      of application.  Solicitors ought to be aware that if whether  through
      lack of instructions or lack of funds they are not going to  be  in  a
      position to assist either the Tribunal or an  adjudicator,  then  they
      ought immediately to apply to be taken off the record.  It is contrary
      to their professional duty to allow matters to proceed and simply  see
      what happens.  This is clearly an appeal with no conceivable merit and
      it is dismissed.
                                                                       [pic]

                                                                  (chairman)
