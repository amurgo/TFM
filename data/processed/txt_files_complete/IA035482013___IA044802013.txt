For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Maguire
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) These are appeals with permission against a  determination  by  Judge  of
   the First-tier Tribunal McGrade dismissing appeals against  removal.   In
   relation to the first appellant, the appeal was dismissed on  the  ground
   that she was not entitled to  stay  in  the  UK  on  the  basis  of  long
   residence under the Immigration  Rules.   The  second  appellant  is  her
   infant child.  Both appellants are nationals of China.

2) It is not disputed that the first appellant arrived in the UK on  14  May
   1998 and was given leave to enter as a student until 14  May  1999.   She
   was subsequently given further leave to  remain  as  a  student  for  two
   additional periods until 31 March 2005.  In March 2005  she  applied  for
   further leave to remain as a student.  According to the  respondent  this
   application was refused and, before the First-tier Tribunal, it  was  the
   respondent's contention that the first appellant was served with  a  form
   IS.151A, informing her of her liability to removal on  30  October  2006.
   The appellant denies that she was served with this form.

3) The  significance  of  this  arises  from  paragraph  276B(i)(b)  of  the
   Immigration Rules, which was the relevant provision in force at the  time
   the first appellant made her application  for  leave  to  remain  on  the
   grounds of long residence on 18  May  2012.    Under  this  provision  an
   application for indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  the  grounds  of  long
   residence may be made on the grounds of 14 years continuous residence  in
   the UK, excluding any period spent in the UK following service of  notice
   of liability to removal.   Accordingly,  if  a  notice  of  liability  to
   removal was served on the first appellant in 2006, then she  cannot  rely
   on 14 years continuous residence as  a  basis  for  indefinite  leave  to
   remain.  It is apparent from the decision of the Judge of the  First-tier
   Tribunal that this was the only objection raised by the respondent to the
   application on the basis of long residence under the Immigration Rules.

4) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  accepted  that  the  appellant  was
   served with the form  IS.151A  in  October  2006  notifying  her  of  her
   liability  to  removal.   The  judge  did  not  accept  as  credible  the
   appellant's denial of this service.  Permission to appeal was granted  on
   the basis that arguably the judge's reasoning  on  which  these  findings
   were based  was  inadequate.   In  addition,  the  copy  of  the  IS.151A
   allegedly served by the respondent was incomplete.

5) At the hearing before us Mrs O'Brien stated  that  further  investigation
   had been made following the grant of permission to appeal.  Although  the
   respondent's computerised data base indicated that it was  the  intention
   to serve a form IS.151A on the first  appellant  in  2006  there  was  no
   substantive evidence of service, in the form, for example, of a  recorded
   delivery number or a covering letter.  It was accordingly  accepted  that
   the respondent could not show that the IS.151A form had  been  served  as
   claimed.

6) As was noted by the Court of Appeal in E v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 49 and  R
   v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 982 unfairness resulting from a  mistake  of  fact
   will be an error of law where it is established that the error  arose  as
   follows:

     i) There must have been a mistake as to an existing fact, including  a
        mistake as to the availability of evidence on a particular matter;


    ii) It must be possible to categorise the relevant fact or evidence  as
        "established"  in  the  sense  that  it   was   uncontentious   and
        objectively verifiable;

   iii) The appellant (or his advisors) must not have been responsible  for
        the mistake;

    iv) The mistake must have played a material (not necessarily  decisive)
        part in the Tribunal's reasoning.

7) We are satisfied that the mistake as to a material  fact  in  respect  of
   the alleged service of a notice of liability to removal falls within  the
   above categories.  The unfairness arising from the factual error over the
   alleged service  of  this  document  amounts  to  an  error  of  law,  in
   consequence of which the decision of the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
   is set aside.

8) It falls to us to re-make the decision.  So far as  the  first  appellant
   is concerned, the only issue on which the respondent founded against  her
   under paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules was the alleged service  of
   the notice of liability to removal (IS.151A) in October 2006.  As it  has
   not been shown that this document was served, as the appellant previously
   contended, then the first appellant will  succeed  in  her  appeal  under
   paragraph 276B.

9) This leaves the position of the second appellant, who is the 3  year  old
   son  of  the  first  appellant.   His  position  was  considered  by  the
   respondent in terms of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, in terms  of
   a refusal letter  of  14  January  2013.   The  position  of  the  second
   appellant was treated this way on the basis that paragraph 276B  made  no
   provision for dependants who had not lived in the  UK  for  the  required
   period.

10) The respondent noted that the first appellant had provided  no  evidence
   that she has a partner in the UK who  met  any  of  the  requirements  of
   Appendix FM which would have enabled the first  appellant  to  apply  for
   leave to remain as a partner.  Indeed, we  note  that  according  to  the
   first appellant's application form she gives no details of  any  partner.
   We proceed on the basis that the appellant is a single parent  with  sole
   responsibility for her son.

11) We do not consider it to be disputed by the  respondent  that  were  the
   first appellant to qualify for indefinite leave to remain under paragraph
   276B on the basis of 14  years  continuous  residence,  then  the  second
   appellant would be permitted to remain with her as her  dependent  child.
   The position of the  second  appellant  does  not  appear  to  have  been
   considered under Appendix FM because, in the view of the respondent,  the
   first appellant could not succeed with her application.   Accordingly  we
   have little evidence before us as to whether the second  appellant  would
   be eligible to succeed under Appendix FM.  Although the  first  appellant
   put on the application form as her net income a figure of ï¿½400 per  week,
   which would bring her close to the financial requirements in  E-LTRC  2.1
   in respect of leave to remain  for  a  child,  there  is  not  sufficient
   evidence for us to be satisfied that this requirement is met.

12) Nevertheless, having regard to the best interests of the child in  terms
   of Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention and to an acknowledgement  on
   behalf of the respondent that the circumstances of the  second  appellant
   would follow those of the first  appellant,  we  have  no  difficulty  in
   concluding that it would not be proportionate for the second appellant to
   be separated  from  the  first  appellant,  the  first  appellant  having
   established her right to remain in the UK under  the  Immigration  Rules.
   Accordingly both appeals will be allowed.

Conclusions

13) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve  the
   making of an error on a point of law.  We set aside the decision.

14) We re-make the decision in the appeals by allowing them.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make a direction for anonymity  pursuant  to
Rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum & Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005.
We do not consider  that  any  order  for  anonymity  is  necessary  in  the
circumstances of this appeal.

Fee Award        (Note: This is not part of the determination)

According to the First-tier Tribunal no fee  was  paid  or  was  payable  in
relation to these appeals and no application for a fee award has  been  made
to us.  Accordingly we make no fee award.
