Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Kerr, counsel, instructed by Karis Law
                    Solicitors (counsel however withdrew his representation
                    during the hearing)
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. This is a re-made decision following the setting aside of an appeal
         decision by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Seelhoff  who,  on
         27/01/2015, allowed the appeal of Ms Flora Mucaj,  a  40  year  old
         national of Kosovo, against a decision of the appellant  to  refuse
         to  grant  her  further  leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  her
         relationship with her British citizen husband and  British  citizen
         child.

      2. The Appellant first sought leave to enter the UK in August 2010  as
         a  visitor.  That  application  was  refused,  as  was  a   further
         application made in March 2011. She then unlawfully entered the  UK
         later the same month. She made an application for leave  to  remain
         on 15 February 2013 on the basis of her Article 8 relationship with
         her partner, who she later married on 15 May 2014, and their child,
         both of who are British citizens. This application was refused  and
         an appealable removal  decision  was  made  on  16  May  2014.  The
         Respondent was not satisfied the Appellant met the requirements  of
         the immigration rules  or  that  her  removal  would  constitute  a
         disproportionate interference with her Article 8 rights  and  those
         of her family.

      3. In  allowing  the  appeal  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  placed
         reliance on a published policy in respect of the 10-year route  for
         settlement  applications  made  by  individuals  on  the  basis  of
         parental relationships with  British  children  ("Appendix  FM  1.0
         Family Life (as a Partner or  Parent)  and  Private  Life:  10-Year
         Routes November  2014").  The  Judge  also  indicated  that,  as  a
         solicitor in practice, and based on  his  own  experience,  he  was
         aware that the Respondent applied the policy in accordance with  an
         extract the Judge  relied  on  in  his  determination  and,  absent
         criminal conduct, he had not seen the parent  of  a  British  child
         refused leave to remain by the Home Office in the last year  and  a
         half. The Judge did not consider it was open to  the  appellant  to
         argue that the parent of a British citizen  should  be  removed  in
         circumstances where the  parents  had  not  been  found  guilty  of
         criminal conduct. Having found the respondent enjoyed  family  life
         with her husband and son,  and  in  the  absence  of  any  contrary
         submission from the Presenting Officer that it was  reasonable  for
         the respondent to leave the UK, the Judge  allowed  the  appeal  on
         Article 8 grounds.

      4. The Respondent's Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal  contended
         that the Judge failed to apply her policy in its entirety and  that
         there was no compulsion on the child to leave the UK as his  father
         remained here, and that any decision by the family to  relocate  to
         the  respondent's  home  country  could  in  the  circumstances  be
         regarded as reasonable. The appellant further  submitted  that,  in
         making reference to his own experience as a  solicitor,  the  Judge
         went beyond  his  remit  as  an  independent  judge  and  that  the
         reference to his experience of the  policy  was  not  supported  by
         details of those other applications.

      5. Having considered the representations by the parties at  a  hearing
         on 22 July 2015 I  was  satisfied  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         materially erred in law.

      6. The relevant part of the Secretary of State's  policy  was  11.2.3.
         This read, in material part:

             'Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker must
             not take a decision in relation to the parent or primary carer
             of a British Citizen child where the effect of that decision
             would be to force that British child to leave the EU,
             regardless of the age of that child. This reflects the
             European Court of Justice judgment in Zambrano.

             ...

             Where a decision to refuse the  application  would  require  a
             parent or primary carer to return to a country outside the EU,
             the case must always be assessed on the basis that it would be
             unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to leave the EU
             with that parent or primary carer.

             In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to
             the parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the
             UK with the child, provided that there is satisfactory
             evidence of a genuine and subsisting parental relationship.

             It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where
             the conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to
             considerations of such weight as to justify separation, if the
             child could otherwise stay with another parent or alternative
             primary carer in the UK or in the EU.

             The circumstances envisaged could cover amongst others:

                . criminality falling below the thresholds set out in
                  paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules;

                . a very poor immigration history, such as where the person
                  has repeatedly and deliberately breached the Immigration
                  Rules.

             In considering whether refusal may be appropriate the decision
             maker must consider the impact on the child of any separation.
             If the decision maker is minded to  refuse,  in  circumstances
             where separation would be the  result,  this  decision  should
             normally be discussed with  a  senior  caseworker  and,  where
             appropriate, advice may be  sought  from  the  Office  of  the
             Children's Champion on the implications for the welfare of the
             child, in order to inform the decision.'

      7. It is apparent from  the  terms  of  the  policy  that  it  may  be
         appropriate for the Secretary of State to  refuse  to  grant  leave
         where there is another parent with whom the child  could  stay  and
         the applicant has, inter alia, engaged  in  criminality  or  has  a
         'very poor immigration history'.

      8. It was accepted by Mr Kerr, who represented the  Appellant  at  the
         hearing before me on  22  July  2015,  that,  apart  from  a  brief
         reference to the Appellant's immigration history, the Judge did not
         give any further consideration to the  nature  of  her  immigration
         history. In applying the policy it was incumbent on  the  Judge  to
         have considered whether the Appellant did indeed have a 'very  poor
         immigration history'. I additionally found it inappropriate for the
         Judge to have referred to his own experience  of  the  Respondent's
         application of her policy in circumstances  where  the  Judge  only
         provided a limited extract of that policy,  where  no  mention  was
         made by him of the 'very poor immigration history'  aspect  of  the
         policy,  and  where  it  was  impossible  to  have  considered  the
         particular details of the applications with  which  the  Judge  was
         involved in his capacity as a solicitor.

      9. Mr Kerr requested an adjournment of the hearing to  enable  further
         written and oral evidence to be adduced in relation to  the  claim,
         both in terms of Appendix FM and in terms  of  any  'free-standing'
         Article 8 claim  outside  the  immigration  rules.  I  granted  the
         adjournment application and I reheard the appeal  on  03  September
         2015.

The rehearing

     10. For the rehearing the Appellant  provided  a  bundle  of  documents
         containing, inter alia, amended statements from her and her partner
         (Gentjan Hyseni), his passport,  their  marriage  certificate,  the
         birth certificate of their  son  (Leo),  a  letter  from  Salusbury
         Primary School, a notification  of  discharge  in  respect  of  the
         Appellant's admission  to  St  Mary's  hospital  on  07  July  2011
         following a miscarriage, a letter from London Pubs  confirming  the
         partner's employment and supporting payslips, an  English  language
         certificate relating to the Appellant and a number of  photographs.
         I was also provided with a skeleton argument by Mr Kerr.

     11. As a preliminary matter Mr Jarvis sought to amend the  Reasons  For
         Refusal Letter to include, as a further reason  for  refusal  under
         the suitability (S-LTR) requirements, reference to the  Appellant's
         immigration history. This point had not been taken  either  in  the
         initial decision, or before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  or  in  the
         Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal. The  application  was  not
         however opposed by  Mr  Kerr,  subject  to  the  existence  of  any
         authority precluding the raising  of  such  grounds  at  this  late
         stage. Given that the Appellant's immigration history  had  already
         been identified and relied on in the Reasons For Refusal Letter,  I
         gave permission to Mr Jarvis to accordingly amend the  Reasons  For
         Refusal Letter.

     12. The Appellant's partner, Mr Gentjan Hyseni, signed and adopted  his
         amended statement. In this document he indicated that he had  lived
         in the United Kingdom since 1998 and gave details of his employment
         history. He claimed his current employment as  a  second  chef  was
         �26,000 and that, with bonuses in respect of which he was  entitled
         to receive, his annual income was nearer a total of �30,000. He met
         the Appellant whilst on holiday in Albania and their son, Leo,  was
         born on 20 Aug 2012. Their son was due to commence  nursery  on  16
         September 2015. The partner was in a serious relationship with  the
         Appellant and he believed their entire life was based in the United
         Kingdom. It was not therefore  possible  to  relocate  outside  the
         United Kingdom.

     13. In examination-in-chief the partner explained that if the Appellant
         returned to Albania and he had to look after  their  son  he  would
         have to give up his full-time job. He would then be unable  to  pay
         their rent of �1,200 a month or buy clothes or food. Nor  would  he
         be able to help the Appellant with any future legal  fees  relating
         to any entry clearance application. His son received 15 hours  free
         child care time a week from the government. The partner  had  asked
         friends if they could help look after his son but  they  had  their
         own families or jobs. If his son went to Albania he would lose  his
         place at nursery if he failed to  regularly  attend.  He  may  also
         encounter difficulties in speaking and understanding English if  he
         had to remain  outside  the  United  Kingdom  for  any  significant
         period.

     14. In cross-examination the partner denied being from Albania and said
         he came from Kosovo. Neither he nor the Appellant had any family in
         the United Kingdom. The partner had made inquiries about  childcare
         provision in his area but it was expensive. It would cost at  least
         �1,000 a month as a minimum. The partner could obtain vouchers from
         his employer leading to a 20% discount in  child  care  costs.  The
         partner had asked his friends whether they could provide  childcare
         but the friends were either too busy or were not bothered about it.
         The partner denied knowing that the Appellant intended to enter the
         United Kingdom illegally. He knew she was going to enter  'one  way
         or another'. When asked whether he expected her to enter the United
         Kingdom illegally the partner answered, "you could say that."

     15. The partner said  the  Appellant  paid  an  agent  3,000  Euros  in
         Brussels to assist her entry. He gave her  the  money  because  she
         needed to live in Belgium and that money obviously  helped  her  to
         come here. Her 2nd entry clearance application, which was  made  in
         Paris, took about 3 weeks to a month to  process.  The  Appellant's
         intention was to meet he partner in  the  United  Kingdom  so  they
         could get to know each other better and then she would return.

     16. In re-examination  the  partner  was  asked  why  his  son's  birth
         certificate indicated he  came  from  Albania.  The  partner  again
         confirmed he came from Kosovo and explained that,  when  the  birth
         was registered, the registrar did not have  Kosovo  listed  on  his
         computer and so they went with Albania instead.  The  partner  said
         his place of birth, Peqin, was a small village in Mitrovica.

     17. The Appellant signed and adopted her statement, amending it as  she
         was born in Kukes but her family lived in Durres. She first met her
         partner in the summer of 2008 when he was holidaying in Albania and
         their relationship commenced about a year later.  She  took  advice
         about applying to stay in the United Kingdom after she  entered  in
         March 2011 but did not  apply  straight  away  because  she  became
         pregnant soon after her arrival and miscarried on 7 July 2011,  and
         because she was advised  to  first  learn  English  and  obtain  an
         English language test, which she did in December 2012. When refused
         her entry clearance application in Tirana in  2010  she  was  aware
         that people could pay �7,000 to corrupt staff to obtain a visa. She
         did not want to be involved in this activity but also felt  it  was
         impossible to obtain a visa lawfully and therefore chose  to  enter
         without permission.  Her partner would not be able  to  look  after
         their child because he worked 50 hours a week and  often  had  long
         shifts into the night.

     18. In examination-in-chief the Appellant said her partner was born  in
         Mitrovica. At this point Mr Kerr indicated that,  as  a  result  of
         professional  embarrassment,  he  felt  he  had  to  withdraw   his
         representation.  There  then  followed  a  discussion  between  the
         representatives as to whether to adjourn the hearing to enable  the
         Appellant to obtain fresh  representation.  The  sponsor  indicated
         that the Appellant was  emotional  and  he  himself  was  taken  by
         surprise by  the  withdrawal,  but  said  that  he  was  likely  to
         represent himself if the appeal hearing was adjourned. I heard from
         the Appellant. She agreed with her partner and said  they  did  not
         have the means to  hire  another  lawyer.  She  said  she  was  not
         emotionally able to continue.

     19. Given the indication from the Appellant and her partner  that  they
         were not likely to be legally represented at any adjourned  hearing
         I saw no utility in adjourning the  hearing  for  that  purpose.  I
         indicated to the Appellant that I would put the appeal hearing back
         in the list to enable  her  to  compose  herself.  At  11:25  am  I
         adjourned the hearing. The partner remained  in  the  hearing  room
         while I heard another appeal. The hearing re-commenced at 11:50.

     20. I first satisfied myself that the Appellant felt  able  to  proceed
         with the hearing. In the absence  of  any  legal  representative  I
         asked the Appellant a number of questions in order to  clarify  her
         evidence. She explained that her  intention  at  the  time  of  her
         visitor application in 2011 was to come to the  United  Kingdom  to
         spend time with her husband and to regularise her stay. She  feared
         that her parents would try to get her engaged to another person  if
         she had returned to Albania. She believed that if  she  spent  time
         with her partner her parents would accept her choice. She  intended
         to enter the United Kingdom legally. When asked what was preventing
         her returning to Albania with her son and making an entry clearance
         application the Appellant said she was not on good terms  with  her
         family and would have no support. Such a move would  interrupt  her
         son's life in the United Kingdom. She had not previously  mentioned
         the problems with her family because she  did  not  want  to  speak
         about her private life. She had told her husband not to speak about
         her private life in detail. She feared her  brothers  as  they  had
         rejected her. In their opinion she had dishonoured the family.  Her
         brothers worked in Tirana, where the embassy was, and it  would  be
         easy for them to find her. She was worried her  son  may  lose  his
         nursery place if he accompanied her to Albania and the absence from
         the United Kingdom may affect his English.

     21. In cross-examination the Appellant confirmed that her  partner  was
         born in Mitrovica. She did not know why  his  place  of  birth  was
         recorded as Albania in their son's birth  certificate  because,  at
         the time of the registration of the birth, her  English  was  poor.
         When asked about her  entry  clearance  application  in  2011,  the
         Appellant said if it was granted it would have made it  easier  for
         her to attempt to then extend her visa. When challenged  about  the
         late disclose of the difficulties with  her  family  the  Appellant
         said she had been reluctant to use this as an excuse to  remain  in
         the United Kingdom. The Appellant denied using an agent to help her
         gain entry to the United Kingdom in 2011. On the Belgium border she
         paid 300 Euros to obtain an ID card. She obtained the funds from  a
         female friend. Other than this, she paid no money to anyone to  get
         her into the United Kingdom. She did not tell her partner  she  was
         going to try to enter the United Kingdom illegally.  The  Appellant
         was aware that her partner spoke to  some  friends  about  possible
         childcare. They were unable to  help  because  of  work  and  other
         social commitments. Her partner had no family in Kosovo and she did
         not think he had any family elsewhere. Her application in 2010 took
         about a month to process.

     22. In his submissions Mr Jarvis stated that the Appellant fell foul of
         the Suitability requirements in S-LTR.1.6. and 2.2. Under 1.6.  The
         Appellant's presence was  not  conducive  because  her  immigration
         history made it  undesirable  for  her  to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom. She had engaged in deliberate behaviour designed to breach
         immigration control. If she  had  obtained  entry  clearance  as  a
         visitor she always intended to remain in  the  United  Kingdom.  Mr
         Jarvis submitted that the obtaining of  an  ID  card  was  serious,
         although he accepted that there was no evidence as to  how,  where,
         or when such an ID had been used. There was no tension  between  S-
         LTR.1.6. and E-LTRP.2.2.  If I accepted his submissions relating to
         the Suitability grounds the Appellant could not  avail  herself  of
         EX.1. and there would have  to  be  consideration  outside  of  the
         immigration rules. However, if I found that the  refusal  under  S-
         LTR.1.6. was not  made  out,  Mr  Jarvis  accepted,  based  on  the
         Appendix FM 1.0 Family Life (as a Partner or  Parent)  and  Private
         Life: 10-Year Routes of November 2014 and an absence of instruction
         to him on the Guidance, that it would be unreasonable for the child
         to leave the United Kingdom. Mr Jarvis  then  made  submissions  in
         relation to the broader Article 8 assessment with reference to  the
         factors identified in sections  117A  and  B  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

     23. The Appellant submitted that she wished to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom with her partner and their child. She  believed  she  would
         not be issued a visa if she returned to  Albania.  She  was  not  a
         person of bad character. She was a good person. Nothing  bad  would
         come to the United Kingdom from her. She wanted a  happy  life  and
         wanted what was best for her son.

Findings

     24. I allowed Mr Jarvis to amend the basis of the refusal  decision  to
         include reference to the suitability requirements, even  though  it
         was sought at the hearing and had not previously been raised at any
         stage, because there was no objection from Mr Kerr and because  the
         Appellant's immigration history had already been relied on  in  the
         Reasons For Refusal Letter, albeit in a different context.

     25. S-LTR.1.6. reads,

             'The presence of the applicant in the UK is not  conducive  to
             the public good because their conduct  (including  convictions
             which do  not  fall  within  paragraphs  S-LTR.1.3  to  1.5.),
             character, associations, or other reasons, make it undesirable
             to allow them to remain in the UK.'

     26. Refusal under this provision is mandatory. It is for the Respondent
         to prove, on the balance of  probabilities,  that  the  Appellant's
         presence is not conducive to  the  public  good  such  that  it  is
         undesirable for her to remain in the United Kingdom.

     27. Mr Jarvis submitted that the Appellant sought to enter  the  United
         Kingdom as a visitor when she had no intention of leaving  had  her
         application been granted, that she then entered illegally, that she
         delayed her regularisation application, and that she had previously
         obtained a false ID. He submitted these were serious factors.

     28. In assessing whether the  amended  decision  properly  refused  the
         application under the Suitability requirements  I  have  considered
         the  whole  of  the  evidence  before  me.   There   were   several
         inconsistencies between the evidence from the Appellant and that of
         her partner. The partner said the Appellant paid 3,000 Euros to  an
         agent to assist her entry to the United Kingdom, but the  Appellant
         claimed she only paid 300 Euros to someone to obtain an ID card  in
         Belgium. The partner said it was the  Appellant's  intention,  when
         she made her second entry clearance application from Paris, to  get
         to know each  other  and  she  would  then  return.  The  Appellant
         indicated that she wished to legally enter the United Kingdom  and,
         once in the United Kingdom, intended to apply for further leave  to
         remain.  There  was  additionally  a  material  omission   in   the
         Appellant's evidence relating to her reasons  for  not  wishing  to
         return to Albania. At the hearing she claimed her family would  try
         to make her marry someone else and that, by refusing to do  so  and
         marrying her partner, she had brought shame on  her  family.  There
         was however no previous mention by the Appellant of this reason for
         not wishing to return to Albania despite the fact that she has been
         legally represented. Nor was there any mention of  this  reason  by
         her partner. The Appellant  sought  to  explain  this  omission  by
         stating that she did not like talking  of  her  family.  I  am  not
         however satisfied this is a credible  explanation  given  the  fact
         that the Appellant was legally represented and  the  centrality  to
         the appeal of the reasonableness of her return to Albania.

     29. Although I hold these  inconsistencies  and  omission  against  the
         Appellant and her partner in terms of their general credibility, in
         light of the following assessment, I do not find that,  by  and  of
         themselves, they render  the  Appellant's  presence  as  being  not
         conducive to the public good.

     30. The Appellant made a visitor application from Tirana in  2010.  Her
         evidence, consistently given with that of  her  partner,  was  that
         this application was to enable them  to  get  to  know  each  other
         better and that she intended to return after the visit.  There  was
         no further challenge from the Presenting Officer to the explanation
         offered for this visitor application. In these  circumstances,  and
         in light of the fact that the relationship  between  the  Appellant
         and her partner  had  only  relatively  recently  commenced,  I  am
         prepared to accept that the  Appellant  did  intend  to  enter  the
         United Kingdom to get to better know the man who would  become  her
         partner while retaining the intention to return to Albania.

     31. The Appellant admitted that, if granted entry  clearance  in  2011,
         she wished to extend her visa after entering the United Kingdom. It
         was not clear to me whether the Appellant realised she would, as  a
         result of the immigration rules, be unable to  extend  her  visitor
         entry clearance after entering  the  United  Kingdom  in  order  to
         remain with her partner. She gave the strong impression during  her
         evidence that she believed she would be entering the United Kingdom
         entirely legally as a visitor and that she  did  not  practice  any
         intentional deception in her visitor application.  There  certainly
         is no evidence before me that the Appellant did use any intentional
         deception in her application in the  sense  that  she  mislead  the
         British High Commission as to the basis for her entry to the United
         Kingdom.

     32. The Appellant explained  that  she  did  not  immediately  seek  to
         regularise her status after entering the United Kingdom because, on
         advice, she was told to obtain an English language certificate, and
         that she had  miscarried.  I  have  seen  evidence,  identified  at
         paragraph 10  of  this  decision,  both  of  the  English  language
         certificate  obtained  by  the  Appellant  in  2012  and   of   her
         miscarriage in July  2011.  I  find  it  inherently  credible  that
         someone who had undergone a miscarriage would be emotionally  upset
         and that this  may  have  inhibited  her  from  making  an  earlier
         application. I also find inherently plausible her explanation  that
         she was advised to obtain  some  evidence  of  her  proficiency  in
         English before  making  an  application  for  leave  to  remain.  I
         additionally note that her application was made within two years of
         her entry to the United Kingdom.  Having  holistic  regard  to  the
         circumstances of her regularisation application I do not  find  the
         delay significantly adds to the Respondent's view that her presence
         is not conducive to the  public  good.  I  am  reinforced  in  this
         conclusion by reference to the fact that the Appellant  voluntarily
         sought to regularise her  status,  and  that  she  has  been  fully
         compliant with the immigration rules and all conditions imposed  on
         her. There is  no  suggestion  that  she  used  any  alias  in  any
         application to the Respondent or that she worked illegally.

     33. The Appellant claimed she obtained an identity card, presumably not
         in her identity, while in Belgium. The Appellant did not  say  that
         she used this identity card to enter the United Kingdom, or that it
         was ever presented to  immigration  officers.  Mr  Jarvis  did  not
         explore whether this card was used at all in  order  to  facilitate
         the  Appellant's  entry  into  France  from   Belgium.   In   these
         circumstances I do not find that the obtaining of an identity  card
         in itself renders the Appellant's presence  not  conducive  to  the
         public good.

     34. I am satisfied, having considered  the  Appellant's  illegal  entry
         into the United Kingdom, that there is a lack  of  any  aggravating
         features such as to render her presence not conducive to the public
         good under the Suitability requirements.  There  is  no  suggestion
         that the Appellant ever sought to obtain public funds in respect of
         which she was not entitled, or that she ever used an alias  in  the
         United Kingdom. There is no evidence that she worked  illegally  in
         the United Kingdom. Nor am I satisfied, in light of my findings  in
         paragraphs 30 & 31 above,  that  the  Appellant  ever  intended  to
         deceive the British High Commission in respect of  her  application
         to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  in  either  2010  or  2011.  Since
         submitting her application she has observed the conditions  imposed
         on her. Having holistic regard to these factors I am not  satisfied
         the amended refusal under S-LTR.1.6. is made out.

     35. Mr Jarvis identified S-LTR. 2.2. (in respect of  the  provision  of
         false information or  a  failure  to  disclose  material  facts  in
         relation to an application)  as  being  potentially  applicable  in
         respect of the partner's place of birth, and possible  nationality.
         As Mr Jarvis however accepted there was  no  inconsistency  between
         the Appellant's evidence and that of her partner  relating  to  his
         origins, and his explanation as to why his son's birth  certificate
         had his nationality  as  Albanian  was  not  challenged.  In  these
         circumstances there  is  no  basis,  on  the  evidence  before  the
         Tribunal, to find that S-LTR. 2.2. was made out.

     36. In light of  the  above  findings  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
         Appellant  has  a  'very  poor  immigration  history'.   In   these
         circumstances, as was accepted by Mr Jarvis, the Appellant  appears
         to  fall  within  the  terms  of  the  Respondent's  stated  policy
         identified at paragraph 6 of this  determination.  The  Appellant's
         conduct has not, on my finding, given  rise  to  considerations  of
         such weight as to justify separation of mother  from  young  child.
         Although she entered the United Kingdom illegally  I  am  satisfied
         the Appellant has not  repeatedly  and  deliberately  breached  the
         immigration rules. The Respondent's own policy indicates that it is
         not reasonable, absent  criminality  or  a  very  poor  immigration
         history, to expect a British national child  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom. I am further satisfied that, as a result of the shift work
         and long hours of his father's employment, and the absence  of  any
         other family or individual who could reasonably provide child care,
         the child would have to leave the United Kingdom. I therefore allow
         the appeal on the basis that the Appellant  meets  the  requirement
         for leave to remain as a partner under R-LTRP.1.1(d),  EX.1  having
         been made out in respect of the Appellant's relationship  with  her
         British national child.

Decision:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I remake that  decision  allowing  the
Appellant's appeal.
