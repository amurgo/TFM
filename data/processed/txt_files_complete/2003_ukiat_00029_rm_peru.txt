Representation:
For the appellant:           Ms S Khan of Counsel instructed by Nirmal Jay
& Co, solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms J Webb, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

     1. This appeal raises a short but important point. The appellant is  a
        citizen of Peru. An Adjudicator Mr F  E  P  Meadows  dismissed  his
        appeal against the decision of the respondent to  refuse  variation
        of leave to remain  following  refusal  to  grant  asylum.  He  had
        produced a number of documents, which he said in his oral  evidence
        before  the  Adjudicator,  supported  his  claims  of  having  been
        arrested twice and tortured whilst in  detention.  These  documents
        had been lodged only two days before the  hearing  of  the  appeal.
        Although Counsel for the appellant  explained  to  the  Adjudicator
        that the delay in lodging the documents was due to her having  been
        on leave, the Adjudicator said, "The actions of  a  genuine  asylum
        seeker would have been for copies of all of the documents  referred
        to in bundle to  have  been  submitted  by  the  Appellant  to  the
        Respondent at the earliest opportunity to allow their  authenticity
        to be checked. Applying the principles set  out  in  Tanveer  Ahmed
        having looked at the evidence in the round I do not  consider  that
        reliance can be placed on any of the documents referred to  in  the
        Appellant's bundle (A9 to A29)"

     2. In giving permission to appeal to the Tribunal, Mr J  Barnes,  Vice
        President said" The adjudicator placed  no  reliance  on  documents
        produced late because he considered this prevented any  opportunity
        for their verification.  Whilst  he  prayed  in  aid  the  Tribunal
        decision in Tanveer Ahmed [2002]UKIAT 00439, it is arguable that he
        did not apply its principles to his decision."

     3. Ms Webb did not advance any argument to support  the  Adjudicator's
        decision. She readily agreed with Ms  Khan's  submission  that  the
        case required fresh hearing before a different Adjudicator.

     4. In our judgment the Adjudicator's approach to and his appraisal  of
        the documents submitted late by the appellant was wrong. Having, in
        his discretion, admitted the documents in  evidence  despite  their
        late submission, it was his duty to appraise  the  documents  fully
        and fairly. His "reliance" on the Tanveer  Ahmed  decision  of  the
        Tribunal is  little  more  than  a  mechanical  recitation  of  the
        citation of this case. He has not explained how  and  why  applying
        the principles set out in Tanveer  Ahmed  decision,  the  documents
        submitted by the appellant could not be relied  upon.  It  was  his
        duty to do so. In our view there is  nothing  in  the  decision  of
        Tanveer Ahmed that justifies the view that documents submitted late
        cannot be relied upon. Furthermore we note that there was no direct
        challenge  to  the  authenticity  of   the   documents   from   the
        respondent's representative before the Adjudicator. The Adjudicator
        should have asked the respondent's representative for his views  on
        the documents and should have, in fairness, invited him to ask  for
        an opportunity to consider the documents fully. He did not.  It  is
        unsatisfactory for an Adjudicator to treat documents  in  this  way
        when  there  is  no  challenge  to  their  authenticity  from   the
        respondent. That does not mean that in the absence of  an  explicit
        challenge from the respondent an Adjudicator must always  accept  a
        document as genuine. Enough has been said on this  subject  by  the
        Courts in the cases of Chen  and  Oleed  and  by  the  Tribunal  in
        Tanveer Ahmed. Without wishing to repeat all the principles set out
        in these cases we believe that the  underlying  principle  requires
        reiteration. The underlying principle rests  on  our  duty  to  act
        fairly and equally. For the process of adjudication to be fair  and
        to be seen to be fair, an Adjudicator should be  extremely  careful
        in making findings on  issues,  particularly  with  regard  to  the
        reliability and weight to be accorded to documents, in the  absence
        of representations from parties. In this case the  Adjudicator  had
        not been asked by the respondent's representative not to  find  the
        documents reliable. He could have but did not. He simply  drew  the
        Adjudicator's attention to the delay in lodging these documents.  A
        document tendered in evidence does not have to be  verified  before
        it is treated as authentic. Further an  "unverified"  document  can
        attract as much weight as one that  has  been  verified.  Similarly
        there is no requirement that a claim of arrest or torture has to be
        corroborated  by  documentary  evidence.   In   this   appeal   the
        Adjudicator not only disregarded the documents as items of evidence
        but also disregarded the oral evidence about arrests and detentions
        only on the basis that these claims had not been corroborated.  The
        determination of the Adjudicator is therefore unsustainable.

     5. The appeal is allowed but only to  the  extent  that  it  is  heard
        afresh by an Adjudicator other than Mr F E P Meadows.
