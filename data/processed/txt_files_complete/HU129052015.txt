                   DECISION AND REASONS - resumed hearing

1.    This is a resumed hearing following my decision on 14th November  2017
    that there was an error of law in the decision the First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge B. Morron), which was set aside.



Background

2.     The appellant is a citizen of Philippines.  She entered  into  a  gay
    relationship with her sponsor and they lived together in the UK.    The
    respondent refused the application on the grounds that the parties  had
    not been living together for two years prior to the  application  being
    made on 22.9.2015. The respondent accepted that the couple  were  in  a
    gay relationship and had lived together since November 2013.  No  other
    grounds for refusal under the rules were identified but the FTJ went on
    to consider finance and accommodation issues  after  the  hearing.  The
    respondent considered paragraph 276ADE.

3.   At the hearing before me the representatives identified  the  following
    issues for determination. The appellant relied on the immigration Rules
    arguing that there was sufficient evidence to  show  that  the  parties
    lived together for the two year period prior to the  application  being
    made. The tenancy agreement had been corrected and confirmed  that  the
    parties were renting a property together. The evidence of finances  met
    the level required. The evidence as to finances needed to be considered
    and the question as to whether the couple were in  fact  cohabiting  at
    the material time. Alternatively, was Article 8 outside  of  the  rules
    engaged? The respondent accepted that the parties were now married  and
    had since November 2013 been together for three and a half years.


Submissions

4.    Mr Nath raised concerns as to the financial  evidence  to  the  extent
    that the P 60 produced was for the tax years 2016/2017 but acknowledged
    that this would cover 2015. Whilst accepting that the  evidence  showed
    that the �18,600 threshold was  met,  he  was  suspicious  because  the
    evidence reflected the exact figure.  Mr Nath argued that Article 8 was
    not engaged as the couple could  continue  their  relationship  through
    "modern means" and that the decision was proportionate given  that  the
    appellant had lived for only a short time in the UK and could return to
    the Philippines to make an out of country application.

5.      Mr Magsino relied on his detailed skeleton  argument  and  submitted
    that the issue of finances had not been raised in the  refusal  letter.
    In any event there was documentary evidence such as payslips and P60 to
    show that the requirements were met at the relevant date.  Ex 2 applied
    in the light of the difficulties faced if the couple  had  to  live  in
    Philippines where there  was  no  protection  from  discrimination  (as
    evidenced in the background material - LGBT in Asia and  articles).  He
    submitted that the  public  interest  was  outweighed  by  the  private
    interest of the appellant and that there was no reason to  justify  why
    she should have to return to the Philippines to make an out of  country
    application.



Findings and reasons

6.    I heard evidence from the appellant and her  partner/sponsor  which  I
    found to be entirely  credible  and  reliable.   In  addition  I  heard
    evidence  from  a  number  of  witnesses  as  to  the  nature  of   the
    relationship between the parties  (which  was  not  contested),  namely
    that they were in a lesbian relationship and had  now  married.   There
    were also letters of support from friends, relatives and the  partner's
    employer which I took into account. The  oral  evidence  given  by  the
    witnesses was reliable and credible.  There was no major  challenge  by
    Mr Nath to any of the oral evidence. One of the issues  he  raised  was
    cohabitation; the appellant's partner worked as a nanny/housekeeper and
    that involved over night stays at her employers.   I  heard  consistent
    evidence from the appellant, her partner and landlady. I was  satisfied
    that for the majority of the time the parties were living together in a
    relationship and that it was only occasionally that the partner  stayed
    overnight at her employers for whom she had worked since 2013.   As  to
    the length of the cohabitation I rely on the  oral  evidence  and  find
    that they were in a lesbian relationship  living  together  since  20th
    October 2010.  Although there was no documentary evidence  produced  in
    support I was satisfied  that  the  oral  evidence  was  reliable.  The
    appellant also produced some documentary evidence to show  cohabitation
    since November 2013 and a joint tenancy agreement since 2015.

7.    The  appellant,  her  partner  and  two  witnesses  gave  evidence  of
    discrimination and harassment towards gay people  in  the  Philippines.
    The appellant and her  partner  stated  that  their  families  did  not
    approve of the relationship, they would not be able to live openly as a
    lesbian couple and they would face discrimination in employment.

8.      I find that the appellant entered the UK in December 2009 by way  of
    entry clearance valid until February 2012, as a fianc�e  of  a  British
    citizen.  The relationship  broke  down  and  the  appellant  formed  a
    relationship with her now wife in October 2010.   They  lived  together
    as a couple in one room since  20th  October  2010  and  remain  living
    together as a married couple since December  2017.   I  find  that  the
    appellant and her partner are lesbians.  I find  that  the  appellant's
    partner is a British Citizen and she is employed as a nanny/housekeeper
    and has earned �18,600.00 per annum since  2013.  I  have  evidence  of
    payslips, bank  statements  and  P60.   The  application  was  made  on
    22.9.2015 under Appendix FM.

9.   In terms of the Rules I am satisfied that the  appellant  has  met  the
    Suitability requirements in S-LTR of R-LTRP1.1 and that she  meets  the
    Eligibility requirements as a partner as defined  in  Gen  1.2,  namely
    that they were living together in a relationship akin to  marriage  for
    at least two years prior to the date of application.   I  am  satisfied
    that she meets the English language requirement. At  the  time  of  the
    application the appellant had no lawful leave to remain in  the  UK  as
    she had overstayed and accordingly she fails to meet  the  requirements
    under E- LTRP 2.2.  Ex.1 (b) applies where the parties are in a genuine
    and subsisting relationship and there are "insurmountable obstacles" to
    family life continuing outside of the UK.   The latter is defined in EX
    2.  Whilst gay relationships  are  not  illegal  in  Philippines  I  am
    satisfied  that  the  appellant  and  her  partner   would   experience
    significant difficulties in continuing their  relationship  outside  of
    the UK because of  discrimination  towards  gay  people  generally,  in
    employment and in legal terms the  marriage  would  not  be  recognised
    under the law (see page 103 Appellant's bundle "Being LGBT  in  Asia").
    I  accept  the  evidence  that  their  families   disapprove   of   the
    relationship and that  they  would  not  be  able  to  live  openly  in
    Philippines as a lesbian couple.  All of these factors would in my view
    entail very serious hardship and accordingly Ex 1 applies.

10.    Alternatively I am satisfied that Article 8 is engaged following  the
    steps in Razgar.  The factors identified  as  insurmountable  obstacles
    amount to compelling circumstances to justify consideration of  Article
    8 outside of the Rules. Family life is established and there  would  be
    an interference if the appellant were required to leave  the  UK.   The
    relationship, which is now formalised in marriage, could not reasonably
    be continued by modern means and that would constitute an interference.
    The interference would not be lawful as the  Rules  have  been  met  in
    substance.  In considering section 117B (2002 Act as amended) as to the
    public interest in the economic well being of the  UK  I  am  satisfied
    that the appellant speaks English and that she is financially supported
    by her partner. The relationship began when the  appellant  had  lawful
    leave in the UK albeit as the fianc�e of another person.  I accept that
    the appellant had no lawful leave since 2012 and that  her  status  was
    precarious during the time the relationship was established.  In  light
    of the fact that the appellant has met the Rules I place less weight on
    sections 117B(4) and (5).  There  is  no  reason  to  justify  why  the
    appellant should return to make an out of country application in  these
    circumstances (Agyarko [2017] UKSC 10 referring  to  Chikwamba  v  SSHD
    [2008] UKHL 40).  Having regard to all the evidence in the round  I  am
    satisfied that the interference would not be proportionate and that the
    private interest of the appellant's family  life  outweigh  the  public
    interest.
