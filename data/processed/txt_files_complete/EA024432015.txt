               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of Algeria,  date  of  birth  22  July  1979,
    applied for and was refused a residence  card  that  is  for  permanent
    residence as  a  divorced  family  member  of  an  EEA  national.   His
    application was refused on 21 October 2015 for reasons  set  out  in  a
    Notice of  Immigration  Decision.   The  refusal  was  with  particular
    reference to Regulations 6, 10 and  15  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006, (the 2006  Regulations).   His  appeal
    against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Hall  (the
    Judge) who dismissed the appeal.  Permission to  appeal  was  given  by
    Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Chapman  on  6  September  2017.    The
    Respondent made a Rule 24 response on 28 September 2017 and I heard the
    error of law hearing on 17 November 2017 in  which  I  found  that  the
    Judge had failed to  address  the  evidence  that  was  given  or  make
    sustainable findings.  In the light of that I decided that the Original
    Tribunal's decision could not stand  and  that  the  matter  should  be
    remade in the Upper Tribunal.

2.    I  gave  directions  accordingly  and  no  further  documentation   or
    submissions have been provided.   The  substance  of  the  Respondent's
    original criticisms were that  the  Appellant  had  failed  to  provide
    appropriate and sufficient documentation which went to  show  that  his
    former spouse was working as required at material times under the  2006
    Regulations.   Through  the  help  of  a  friend,   Ms   Tavares,   the
    documentation had  been  provided,  including  authoritative  documents
    issued by HMRC, that showed the  Appellant's  former  spouse  had  been
    working at material times so as to enable the Appellant to qualify  for
    permanent residence.

3.   No issue was taken as to the reliability of the  information  which  Ms
    Tavares had been able to produce nor  to  the  substance  of  the  HMRC
    documentation.  In the circumstances, when no issue  had  been  raised,
    the Judge's criticisms of the documents such as  they  were,  were  not
    sufficient.  I find the documentation  sufficiently  reliable  for  the
    Appellant to show he has discharged the burden of proof upon a  balance
    of probabilities that he met the relevant  requirements  for  permanent
    residence.

4.   There were  therefore  no  further  issues  taken  as  to  the  factual
    requirements that the Appellant needed to  establish  to  maintain  his
    claim under Regulation 15 as to the right to permanent residence.

5.   In these circumstances the  only  reasonable  conclusion  that  can  be
    reached is that the Appellant has proved that  his  former  spouse  was
    employed at the date of divorce.   The  other  documentation  including
    payslips and an employer's letter all form part of a consistent picture
    together with that from HMRC which shows the likelihood  of  employment
    of his ex-spouse.

6.   In the light  of  the  Judge's  other  findings  I  conclude  that  the
    Appellant had done enough to establish that  entitlement  to  permanent
    residence under Regulation 15 and accordingly,  there  being  no  other
    impediment or criticism of the Appellant's suitability by reference  to
    the Rules, that a permanent residence card should be issued.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The appeal is allowed.
No anonymity was sought nor is one required or appropriate.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

A fee of �140 was paid and in the circumstances the appeal having  succeeded
on the basis of the information that was subsequently provided  to  that  of
the Respondent's decision but essentially was provided to the Judge, I  find
that a fee award is appropriate and I make one in the sum of �140.
