Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr P Richardson of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellants appealed against the decision of  Judge  Howard  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 30th October 2015.

 2. The Appellants are citizens of Pakistan and  are  married.   The  first
    Appellant gives her date of birth as 18th November 1949, and the second
    Appellant his date of birth as 11th February 1945.

 3. The applications applied for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  as
    adult dependent relatives.  They wished to settle in the United Kingdom
    and live with their sons Fahd Majeed and Fraz Majeed (the Sponsors).

 4. The applications were refused  on  9th  October  2014.   In  the  first
    Appellant's case it was not accepted that paragraphs E-ECDR.2.4 and 2.5
    of Appendix FM were satisfied, and in the second Appellant's  case  the
    only issue was whether E-ECDR.2.5 was satisfied.  For ease of reference
    those paragraphs are set out below;

         'E-ECDR.2.4   The applicant or, if the applicant and their  partner
                    are  the  sponsor's   parents   or   grandparents,   the
                    applicant's partner, must as a result of age, illness or
                    disability require long term personal  care  to  perform
                    everyday tasks.

         E-ECDR.2.5    The applicant or, if the applicant and their  partner
                    are  the  sponsor's   parents   or   grandparents,   the
                    applicant's partner,  must  be  unable,  even  with  the
                    practical and financial help of the sponsor,  to  obtain
                    the required level of care in the country where they are
                    living, because -

                    (a)    it is not available and there  is  no  person  in
                        that country who can reasonably provide it; or

                    (b)    it is not affordable.'

 5. The appeals were heard together on  22nd  July  2015.   The  FtT  heard
    evidence from the Sponsors  and  found  that  the  Appellants  did  not
    satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules set out  above.   The
    appeals were therefore  dismissed  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   In
    relation to Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention on  Human  Rights
    (the 1950 Convention) the FtT recorded that no  Article  8  appeal  was
    advanced.

 6. The Appellants applied for and were granted permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal.

Error of Law

 7. At a hearing before me on 30th June 2016, I heard submissions from both
    parties regarding error of law.  Full details of  the  application  and
    grant of permission, and the submissions  made,  are  contained  in  my
    error of law decision dated 20th June 2016.

 8. I set out below my conclusions and reasons for finding an error of  law
    and setting aside the decision of the FtT;

         "15. Having carefully considered the evidence that was  before  the
             FtT, I find the FtT erred in law as contended in ground 1.  In
             paragraphs 17 and 18 the  FtT  stated  that  it  was  not  the
             Sponsors' evidence that they would fulfil a caring role in the
             UK for the Appellants, but  they  would  "buy  this  care  for
             them".  The FtT went on to state that this begs  the  question
             whether such care can be purchased in Pakistan, and whether it
             would be appropriate to their respective needs.

         16.  I agree with the submission made by Mr  Richardson  that  this
             does not in fact reflect the case that was put to the FtT.  In
             paragraph 8 of the  Grounds  of  Appeal  to  the  FtT,  it  is
             contended that care in the UK would in fact be provided by the
             Sponsors and that accommodation is readily available  for  the
             Appellants.  Both the Appellants'  sons  (the  Sponsors)  made
             witness statements in almost  identical  terms.   I  refer  to
             paragraph 8 of both witness statements in which it is stated;

                  "It is very crucial for them to  have  family  members  to
                  provide them emotional support and to  provide  them  with
                  the care and help they need to perform everyday tasks,  as
                  their medical condition does not  allow  them  to  perform
                  their routine tasks on their own."

         17.  At paragraph 11 both Sponsors state;

                  "In total I will save approximately �1,000 if  my  parents
                  are granted entry  clearance.   My  wife  is  not  working
                  therefore she will look after my  parents  for  all  their
                  needs 24/7."

         18.  They also set out at paragraph 14;

                  "14. I confirm that my parents will be living with me  and
                      my brother and we will be responsible to bear all the
                      expenses of the sponsored during their  stay  in  the
                      United Kingdom."

         19.  Therefore when considering the required level of care,  it  is
             clear that the case put on behalf of the Appellants  was  that
             they would require care from family members and this  includes
             emotional support.  It was however stated by the Sponsors that
             they would not be paying for a full-time  carer,  but  on  the
             contrary, their wives would be providing care, and they  would
             be providing accommodation.  Care would therefore be  provided
             by family members.

         20.  In my view the FtT misunderstood this, and paragraph  17  does
             not accurately set out the Appellants' case.

         21.  I find myself in agreement with  the  submission  made  by  Mr
             Richardson, that the FtT was not  bound  to  accept  the  case
             advanced by the Sponsors, but that the FtT failed to  properly
             identify what that case was, and failed to have regard to  the
             Sponsors' evidence in support of it.

         22.  I therefore conclude that the FtT materially erred in  law  on
             this issue.

         23.  In relation to Article 8, it was conceded  that  the  FtT  had
             erred in law by not addressing this, as it was  accepted  that
             Article 8 was raised as a Ground of Appeal.  I find the  error
             to be material, as I do not find that it can appropriately  be
             said that the Article 8 case has no  prospects  whatsoever  of
             success.

         24.  Therefore the decision  of  the  FtT  is  set  aside  with  no
             findings preserved."

 9. The hearing was adjourned to enable further evidence  to  be  given  on
    behalf of the Appellants.

Re-making the Decision - Upper Tribunal Hearing 13th September 2016

Preliminary Issues

10. I ascertained that I had received  all  documentation  upon  which  the
    parties intended to rely.  The Tribunal file contained the Respondent's
    bundle that was before the FtT, and the Appellants'  bundle  comprising
    191 pages.

11. In addition further evidence had been received  attached  to  a  letter
    from Mr Richardson dated  11th  August  2016.   This  further  evidence
    consisted of a medical report from Dr Dawood dated  24th  May  2016,  a
    letter from Qureshi Hospital, evidence of land owned by the Appellants,
    and copy British passports of the Appellants' grandchildren.

12. Mr Whitwell had received the additional  evidence  which  was  admitted
    without objection, but did not have a copy of  the  Appellants'  bundle
    that had been before the FtT.  The hearing was therefore  put  back  to
    enable Mr Whitwell to receive copies of the relevant documentation.

13. When the hearing resumed  Mr  Richardson  advised  that  although  both
    Sponsors were present, only Fraz Majeed would be called  to  give  oral
    evidence.

14. Both representatives indicated that they  were  ready  to  proceed  and
    there was no application for an adjournment.

Oral Evidence - Fraz Majeed

15. Mr Majeed gave  his  evidence  in  English.   He  adopted  his  witness
    statement dated 14th July 2015 which is summarised below.

16. Mr Majeed is an IT consultant.  At the date of making his statement  he
    had leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 Migrant.  The Appellants  are
    his parents.

17.  The  Appellants  are  not  in  good  health  and   their   health   is
    deteriorating.

18. The second Appellant requires round-the-clock personal care and  had  a
    heart bypass in 1995.  He is unable to perform daily tasks.

19. The first Appellant suffers from high blood  pressure  and  back  pain.
    She used to look after her  husband,  the  second  Appellant,  but  her
    health has deteriorated and she can  no  longer  do  so,  and  is  also
    suffering from chronic knee and ankle joint pain and muscle  stiffness.
    She also complains of vertigo, headaches and vomiting.

20.  Mr  Majeed  explained  in  his  statement  that  the  Appellants   are
    financially and emotionally totally  dependent  upon  himself  and  his
    brother who have concerns about  the  hostile  situation  in  Pakistan.
    Both Mr Majeed and his brother firmly believe that it is  crucial  that
    the Appellants have family members to help and support them.  There are
    no such family members in Pakistan.

21. Mr Majeed explained that it is hard to find carers with  qualifications
    in Pakistan and that he and his brother are currently paying a carer  a
    salary of �500 per month to look after their parents.

22. If the Appellants are granted entry clearance, Mr  Majeed's  sister-in-
    law would look after them and his wife would assist.

23. In answering questions put by Mr Richardson, Mr Majeed  confirmed  that
    he and his brother and their families live in the  same  property.   He
    confirmed that his father owns  land  and  residential  property  which
    would be sold if  entry  clearance  was  granted.   The  value  of  the
    property is in excess of �150,000.

24. Mr Majeed confirmed that he visited his parents in October 2015  for  a
    month, his sister-in-law visited  in  January  2016  for  approximately
    three months, and a couple of months after that his brother visited for
    a period of three weeks.

25. Mr Majeed believed that the care that was required  by  the  Appellants
    was care by family members rather than paid carers.

26. Mr Majeed was  cross-examined.   I  have  recorded  all  questions  and
    answers in my Record of Proceedings and it is not necessary to set them
    out in full here.

27. In brief summary Mr Majeed explained that  his  parents  need  personal
    care which is why care should be  given  by  family  members.   It  was
    socially unacceptable for care to be given by non-family members.

28. Mr Majeed explained that cost was an issue but not the only  issue,  in
    that he and his brother did not wish to have his parents  looked  after
    by people who are not family members and who did not know them well.

29. Mr Majeed said that he could not go to  Pakistan  permanently  to  look
    after his parents because his children are British and could  not  live
    in Pakistan.

30. Mr Majeed confirmed that he has three cousins living not far  from  his
    parents in Pakistan.  He also confirmed that his parents were currently
    being cared for by a full-time carer who was paid by  himself  and  his
    brother.

The Respondent's Submissions

31. Mr Whitwell relied upon the refusal decisions dated 9th  October  2014.
    I was reminded that I should consider the circumstances as at the  date
    of refusal as this was an appeal against refusal of entry clearance.

32. Mr Whitwell submitted that the Appellants currently had a carer who was
    providing the care that they needed.

33. I was asked to find that the evidence did not indicate  that  any  care
    required was not available in Pakistan.  If the Appellants were granted
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom, the Sponsors proposed that their
    wives would look after them, and Mr Majeed had confirmed that they  had
    no formal caring qualifications whatsoever.  It was therefore  apparent
    that the Appellants did not need specialised care.

34. Mr Whitwell pointed out that the evidence indicated that there  are  at
    least  three  family  members  in  Pakistan  who  live  close  to   the
    Appellants.

35. With reference to Article 8 of the 1950 European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights, Mr Whitwell submitted that this was not engaged on the basis of
    either family or private life.  In the alternative, if  Article  8  was
    engaged, the decision to refuse entry clearance  was  proportionate  in
    the interests of maintaining effective immigration control.

The Appellants' Submissions

36. Mr Richardson  reminded  me  that  it  was  accepted  that  the  second
    Appellant needed long-term personal care.  I was asked to find that the
    care needs of both Appellants were not being met in Pakistan.  This was
    evidenced  by  the  fact  that  the  first   Appellant's   health   was
    deteriorating.

37. The issue that had to be  decided  was  whether  the  Appellants  could
    obtain the required level of care in Pakistan.  I  was  asked  to  find
    that care by a third party, and  not  a  family  member,  was  not  the
    required level of care.

38. I was asked to find that the medical evidence could be read as  meaning
    care was needed from family members.

39. Mr Richardson pointed out that both Sponsors are now settled in the UK,
    as Mr Majeed now has indefinite leave to remain, and his brother  is  a
    British citizen.  This appeal is about the  Appellants  requiring  care
    from their children in their old age.  I was asked to allow the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

40. If the appeal was not allowed under the rules, I was asked to  consider
    Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.  I was asked to find that  the
    Appellants had a dependency upon the Sponsors which amounted to  family
    life  that  would  engage  Article  8.   Refusal  of  entry   clearance
    interfered with their family life with the Sponsors, and I was reminded
    that both Sponsors have British children.  It would not  be  reasonable
    for British children to leave the UK and live in Pakistan.  I was asked
    to find that  refusal  of  entry  clearance  was  disproportionate  and
    therefore breached Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

My Conclusions and Reasons

41. I have considered all the evidence both oral and documentary  that  has
    been  presented,  together  with   the   submissions   made   by   both
    representatives.

42.  I  remind  myself  that  when  considering  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules, the burden of proof is on the  Appellants,  and  the
    standard of proof is a balance of probability.

43. Both representatives submitted that the relevant date when  considering
    evidence is the date of refusal, that being 9th October  2014,  because
    this is an appeal against refusal of entry clearance.  I accept this to
    be the case, because  the  application  for  entry  clearance  and  the
    refusal pre-date the changes made to appeal rights by  the  Immigration
    Act 2014,  and  the  amendments  to  section  85  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  In practical terms,  I  do  not  find
    that whether I considered the evidence at the date of  refusal,  or  at
    the date of hearing, would make a material difference.

44.  I  firstly  consider  E-ECDR.2.4  which  relates  only  to  the  first
    Appellant, who  must  prove  that  as  a  result  of  age,  illness  or
    disability, she requires long-term personal care  to  perform  everyday
    tasks.

45. Specified evidence must be provided to discharge the burden  of  proof,
    and this evidence is set out in paragraph 34 of Appendix FM-SE which is
    set out below;

         '34. Evidence that, as a result of age, illness or disability,  the
             applicant requires long term personal  care  should  take  the
             form of -

             (a)   independent  medical  evidence  that   the   applicant's
                  physical  or  mental  condition  means  that  they  cannot
                  perform everyday tasks; and

             (b)  this must be from a doctor or other health professional.'



46. On this issue I have taken  into  account  Dr  Dawood's  brief  medical
    report dated 13th February 2014 at page 12 of the  Appellants'  bundle.
    This does not confirm that the first Appellant cannot perform  everyday
    tasks.  The report states that it is difficult for the first  Appellant
    to maintain her routine activities.

47. I have  also  considered  Dr  Muhammed's  report  at  page  27  of  the
    Appellants' bundle.  This followed an examination on 20th October 2014.
     I do not find that this report satisfies the evidential requirement as
    the report states that it is difficult for the  Appellant  to  maintain
    routine activities  but  does  not  confirm  that  she  cannot  perform
    everyday tasks.

48. I have also considered the additional evidence,  that  being  a  letter
    from Qureshi Hospital which appears to  be  dated  18th  October  2014.
    Again I  am  afraid  I  do  not  find  this  satisfies  the  evidential
    requirements.  This report is extremely brief, stating that  the  first
    Appellant is being treated for blood pressure, leg and feet  pain.   It
    describes her being unable to perform her  household  work.   There  is
    insufficient detail in this report.  It does not  specifically  confirm
    that the first Appellant cannot perform  everyday  tasks,  as  everyday
    tasks  could  be  different  to  household  work.   The   evidence   is
    insufficient.

49. I have also considered Dr Dawood's report dated  24th  May  2016.   The
    first point that I have to make, is that this report  does  not  detail
    the first Appellant's medical condition at the date  of  refusal  which
    was October 2014.  In any event, the report does not  specifically  say
    that the first Appellant cannot perform everyday tasks,  which  is  the
    evidential requirement, but makes reference  to  suffering  significant
    difficulty with  her  movement  which,  "has  drastically  reduced  her
    ability to look after herself and to do her routine tasks on a  regular
    basis and also making her very vulnerable".

50. Having considered all the medical evidence in  relation  to  the  first
    Appellant, I cannot find this proves on a balance  of  probability  she
    cannot perform everyday tasks.

51. I then move on to consider E-ECDR.2.5 in relation to  both  Appellants.
    Again, specified evidence is required.  This evidence is  contained  in
    paragraph 35 of Appendix FM-SE which I set out below;

         '35. Independent evidence that the applicant is unable,  even  with
             the practical and financial help of the Sponsor in the UK,  to
             obtain the required level of care in the  country  where  they
             are living should be from:

             (a)  a central or local health authority;

             (b)  a local authority; or

             (c)  a doctor or other health professional.'

52. Dealing with the evidence  in  relation  to  the  first  Appellant,  Dr
    Dawood's report of 13th February 2014 does not say the  required  level
    of care is not available.  Neither does the report of Dr  Muhammed  who
    examined the first Appellant on 20th October 2014.

53. The report from Qureshi Hospital does not state the required  level  of
    care is not available, although Dr Dawood in his  report  of  24th  May
    2016 does state the required level of care for the first Appellant  has
    not been provided and no such care is available.  Dr Dawood notes  that
    home carers are not trained and qualified enough.

54. I do  not  find  that  Dr  Dawood  has  given  sufficient  or  adequate
    information as to what the required level of care is.  Dr Dawood  makes
    reference to the first Appellant  needing  family  care  and  emotional
    support, and makes no specific mention of specialist medical care being
    required.

55. The case put by the Sponsors, is that if the Appellants came to the UK,
    they would be cared for by the Sponsors' wives, who are not in any  way
    qualified as carers.  The case therefore is that the  first  Appellant,
    and indeed the second Appellant, need care from their family.  I do not
    find that evidence has been submitted to prove that the required  level
    of care required by the Appellants, means that they must be  cared  for
    by family  members.   The  care  that  is  required  is  to  enable  an
    individual to perform everyday tasks.  There is not a requirement  that
    such care must be given by close family members, and I do not find that
    evidence has been submitted to prove that the first Appellant  requires
    long-term personal care, but even if she did,  the  evidence  does  not
    indicate that the required level of care in Pakistan is not  available.



56. The evidence in relation to the  second  Appellant  is  a  letter  from
    Sialkot Medical Complex at page 11 of  the  Appellants'  bundle.   This
    report is brief and undated.  It confirms that the second Appellant  is
    suffering from "seizures and sudden collapse".  There is  reference  to
    the second Appellant needing a "caretaker".   I  am  afraid  that  this
    evidence does not satisfy the requirement that the second Appellant  is
    unable to obtain the required level of care in Pakistan.

57. I fully accept that the Sponsors wish to look after their  parents  and
    very much wish their parents to be able to join them in the UK.  I also
    accept that the Sponsors believe that  their  parents  need  care  from
    family members, but applying the provisions of the  Immigration  Rules,
    the evidence does not prove that the Appellants are  unable  to  obtain
    the required level of care in Pakistan.

58. The evidence indicates that both Appellants have in the  past  and  are
    still continuing to receive a  considerable  amount  of  medical  care.
    They have a full-time carer at home.  It is not the case that the  care
    is not affordable.  The Sponsors have not said this, but have said that
    it would be less expensive for them if their parents were granted entry
    clearance.  If it was the case that the required level of  care  is  no
    longer affordable, the evidential requirements of paragraphs 36 and  37
    of Appendix FM-SE would apply, and these paragraphs are set out below;

         "36. If the applicant's required care has previously been  provided
             through a private  arrangement,  the  applicant  must  provide
             details of that arrangement and why it is no longer available.



         37.  If the applicant's required level of care is  not,  or  is  no
             longer,  affordable  because  payment  previously   made   for
             arranging this care is no longer  being  made,  the  applicant
             must provide records of that payment and an explanation of why
             that payment cannot continue.  If financial support  has  been
             provided by the Sponsor or other close family in the  UK,  the
             applicant must provide  an  explanation  of  why  this  cannot
             continue or is no longer sufficient  to  enable  the  required
             level of care to be provided."

59. For the reasons given above the burden of proof has not been discharged
    in relation to the Immigration Rules, and therefore I must dismiss  the
    appeals on that basis.

60. I then consider Article 8 of the 1950 Convention bearing  in  mind  the
    guidance given in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA  Civ  387  paragraph  40  that
    compelling  circumstances  must  exist,  which  are  not   sufficiently
    recognised under the Immigration Rules, to require the grant  of  leave
    to enter pursuant to Article 8.

61. In considering Article 8, the burden of proof is on the  Appellants  to
    establish that they have a family  and/or  private  life  that  engages
    Article 8.  If that is established, the Respondent must show  that  the
    decision is lawful, necessary for one of the reasons set out in Article
    8(2), and proportionate.

62. I  do  not  find  that  the  Appellants  have  proved  that  they  have
    established a family or private life with their family in the UK.   The
    Appellants chose to live in India, and their sons chose to live in  the
    UK.  The Appellants and their sons have not lived together in a  family
    unit for many years.  I accept that cohabitation is  not  essential  to
    prove a family life, but I find it a relevant factor.   The  Appellants
    and Sponsors are adults, and for family life to  be  established,  they
    must prove something more than normal emotional ties.

63. I accept that the Sponsors  financially  support  the  Appellants,  but
    having considered all  the  circumstances,  I  do  not  find  that  the
    Appellants and Sponsors have  a  family  life  together,  that  engages
    Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.  Equally, I  do  not  find  that  the
    Sponsors have established a private life in the UK  that  would  engage
    Article 8.

64. As I do not find that a family or private  life  exists  which  engages
    Article 8, normally I would  not  go  on  to  consider  the  five-stage
    approach advocated by the House of Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

65. However, I will go on to consider the five-stage Razgar approach, if it
    is found that I am incorrect in finding that Article 8 is not  engaged.



66. If Article 8 is engaged, I find that the Respondent's interference with
    the Appellants' private or family life is in accordance with  the  law,
    because  the  Appellants  cannot  satisfy  the  requirements   of   the
    Immigration Rules in order to be granted entry clearance.

67. I then  find  that  the  proposed  interference  is  necessary  in  the
    interests  of  maintaining  effective  immigration  control,  which  is
    necessary to protect the economic well-being of the country.

68. The final issue  to  be  considered  is  whether  the  interference  is
    proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be  achieved.   In
    considering proportionality, I take into  account  the  wishes  of  the
    Appellants and the  Sponsors  that  the  Appellants  be  granted  entry
    clearance.   I  have  to  take  into  account  section  117B   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   This  states  that  the
    maintenance  of  effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the   public
    interest.  It is in the public interest that persons seeking  to  enter
    or remain in the United Kingdom can speak English and  are  financially
    independent.  There is  no  evidence  that  the  Appellants  can  speak
    English, and they would not be financially independent,  but  would  be
    dependent upon the Sponsors.

69. In my view when considering proportionality, I must attach  significant
    weight to the need  to  maintain  effective  immigration  control,  and
    significant weight must be given to the fact that the Appellants cannot
    satisfy the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  in  order  to  be
    granted entry clearance.  I do not find that any compelling reason  has
    been given as to why the Immigration Rules should be disregarded.

70. I find that the weight to be given  to  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control, outweighs the weight to be given to the wishes  of
    the Appellants and Sponsors to live together  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    notwithstanding that the Immigration  Rules  cannot  be  satisfied.   I
    therefore conclude that the Respondent's decision is lawful,  necessary
    and proportionate and does not breach Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and  was
set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeals are dismissed.

Anonymity

No anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no request for anonymity made to the Upper Tribunal and I  see  no  need  to
make an anonymity order.
