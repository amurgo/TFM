                            DECISION AND REASONS



INTRODUCTION

 1. Although the appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  has  been  brought  by  the
    Secretary of State, for ease of reading, I shall refer to  the  parties
    as they were before the First-tier Tribunal: the Secretary of State  is
    once more "the respondent" and Mr Munir is "the appellant".

 2. The respondent appeals against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Rowlands ("the judge"), promulgated on 3 January 2020,  by  which
    he allowed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  refusal  of
    his human rights claim.

 3. The appellant had originally arrived in the United Kingdom in 2006 with
    leave as a  student.  He  obtained  at  least  one  extension  in  that
    capacity. An appeal against a subsequent refusal of further  leave  was
    dismissed and the appellant became appeal rights exhausted on  11  June
    2010. Meanwhile the appellant had applied for a certificate of approval
    to marry a Hungarian national, Ms K. This application had been made  on
    17 December 2009 and was granted on 12  December  2010.  The  appellant
    married Ms K on 18 May 2011 and subsequently applied for and was issued
    with a residence card. The residence card was  revoked  on  1  November
    2016 and an appeal dismissed on 26 February 2018.  This  decision  went
    unchallenged.

 4. The appellant then made a human rights claim on 20 October  2017.  This
    was refused on 18 April 2018. An appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  was
    dismissed but its decision was subsequently  set  aside  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal and the matter remitted. In this way the  matter  came  before
    Judge Rowlands.



THE JUDGE'S DECISION

 5. Having  set  out  the  immigration  history,  the  judge  recorded  the
    appellant's acceptance that was unable to meet the requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules ("the  Rules"),  specifically  paragraph  276B  (long
    residence in the context of ten years' continuous lawful  residence  in
    the United Kingdom). The judge was satisfied that Article 8 was engaged
    in respect of the appellant's private life and  that  the  respondent's
    refusal of the human rights claim constituted an interference with that
    protected right. In paragraph 14 the judge made  reference  to  factors
    connected to the mandatory considerations set out in  section  117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  ("the  2002  Act").
    Paragraph 15 states as follows:

         "15. I have now taken into account the fact that, were it  not  for
         the consent to marry issue, his time in the  United  Kingdom  would
         have  all  been  lawful  in  which  case  he  would  have  met  the
         Immigration Rules and would have  by  right  been  given  leave  to
         remain on the basis of his long residence. I find that this  weighs
         heavily in his favour in the proportionality  test  such  that  his
         removal would be  disproportionate  and  that  he  is  entitled  to
         succeed under Article 8."



THE CHALLENGE

 6. The respondent's grounds are in essence twofold. First, it is said that
    the judge erred in respect  of  his  consideration  of  the  continuous
    lawful residence issue with particular reference  to  what  appears  to
    have been his reliance on a delay  in  approving  the  certificate  for
    approval application. Second, it is  said  that  the  judge  failed  to
    adequately consider the mandatory considerations under section 117B  of
    the 2002 Act.

 7. Permission was granted on all grounds.

 8. A rule 24 response was then provided by the appellant's representatives
    and a skeleton argument followed from the respondent.

 9. I heard concise submissions from Mr Kotas and Ms Ofei-Kwatia,  which  I
    will not repeat here.



DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

10. I am satisfied that the judge did materially err in law.

11. On a sensible reading of the decision, the cornerstone of  the  judge's
    reasoning as to why the appeal should be allowed on Article  8  grounds
    was that there had  been  a  delay  by  the  respondent  of  sufficient
    magnitude in respect of the certificate of approval application  so  as
    to substantially reduce the weight afforded to the public interest (or,
    alternatively, to substantially increase the weight to be given to  the
    appellant's private life). This premise was in  my  view  fundamentally
    flawed.

12. As  noted  earlier,  there  was  a  delay  in  the  processing  of  the
    certificate  of  approval  application.  This  amounted   to,   on   my
    calculation, five days short of a year. On any rational view  and  with
    particular regard to what is said in the well-known decision of Collins
    J in FH and others [2007] EWHC 1571 (Admin) and the discussion set  out
    in paragraph 16 of EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41; [2008] 3 WLR  178,  this
    delay could not be considered unreasonable, inordinate, illustrative of
    a dysfunctional system, or in any other way deserving of the importance
    attributed to it by the judge in this  particular  case.  There  is  no
    indication whatsoever of any time limits within which such applications
    should be determined. There were no undertakings given to the appellant
    as to how long it would take  for  his  particular  application  to  be
    determined. In order for the delay point to have even stood a chance of
    being a relevant factor, the judge would have needed to  conclude  that
    the application should have been determined before 11  June  2010  (the
    point at which the appellant became an overstayer). No such  conclusion
    was stated and, if it had, it would have been eminently susceptible  to
    a rationality challenge: a  period  of  some  six  months  (the  period
    between the date of application  and  11  June  2010)  could  not  have
    amounted to a material delay. Whilst it no doubt would have been  ideal
    for the application to have been determined sooner, the  fact  that  in
    the event it took just under a year was not a factor that  was  capable
    of attracting such weight as to  tip  the  scales  in  the  appellant's
    favour, particularly when the considerations under section 117B of  the
    2002 Act were taken into account.

13. The judge's decision must be set aside on this basis alone.

14. There is a further matter which falls to be considered  in  respect  of
    the delay. In 2018 an appeal by the appellant against the revocation of
    a residence card was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the
    primary basis that the marriage to Ms K had  been  one  of  convenience
    (EA/13327/2016. Ms Ofei-Kwatia confirmed that  she  was  aware  of  the
    decision and its contents, and I am satisfied that the judge was  aware
    of its existence, if not perhaps everything stated therein).  It  seems
    to me unreal, for want of a better term, for the appellant to have been
    able to rely on a delay in obtaining a certificate of  approval  which,
    when it was  granted,  he  then  used  to  enter  into  a  marriage  of
    convenience.

15. In respect of the second ground of appeal, I acknowledge that the judge
    made reference to factors in paragraph 14 which bore on section 117B of
    the 2002 Act. I have to say it does rather look to  me  as  though  the
    appellant's financial independent and ability  to  speak  English  were
    counted as positive factors as  opposed  to  being  of  neutral  value,
    although this is not of any great consequence. More importantly, whilst
    the judge acknowledges what is described as the appellant's "unsettled"
    status in the United Kingdom,  he  failed  to  undertake  any  reasoned
    assessment of why that precarious status should attract anything  other
    than limited weight in light of section 117B(5) of the 2002 Act. In  my
    view the judge has made an observation as to the  status  but  has  not
    then gone on to engage with it on a correct legal footing. This amounts
    to a second material error of law.

16. I set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.



RE-MAKING THE DECISION

17. Both representatives were agreed that I should go on  and  re-make  the
    decision without a further hearing. This I now do.

18. By way of evidence, I have taken into account  the  appellant's  bundle
    prepared for the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal,  indexed  and
    paginated 1-155. No further evidence had been adduced in respect of the
    re-making decision. The appellant was not called to give oral  evidence
    and the hearing proceeded by way of submissions  only  (Ms  Ofei-Kwatia
    declined the opportunity to  provide  additional  post-hearing  written
    submissions).

19. Mr Kotas' submissions were to the point. He submitted that in light  of
    the evidence and relevant case-law it  was  clear  that  the  appellant
    could not succeed on Article 8 grounds. He was unable to  meet  any  of
    the relevant Rules. It had not been suggested that there were any  very
    significant obstacles to his integration into Pakistani society. Beyond
    this and in light of the mandatory considerations set  out  in  section
    117B of the 2002 Act, there was no merit in the claim.

20. Ms Ofei-Kwatia  relied  on  the  rule  24  response  and  the  evidence
    contained  in  the  appellant's  bundle,  in  particular  the   witness
    statement dated 15 October 2019.



Findings of fact

21. In light of the evidence as a whole, I make the following  findings  of
    primary fact.

22. I find that the appellant's  immigration  history  is  as  set  out  in
    paragraphs 3 and 4, above.

23. I find that the appellant married a Hungarian national, Ms K, on 18 May
    2011. However, I do not accept that prior to this they were ever  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship,  as  apparently  accepted  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal on the basis that the appellant's witness statement
    had not been challenged. The reason why I have taken a  different  view
    is  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  2018  decision  in  respect   of   the
    appellant's appeal against the revocation of  the  residence  card.  As
    stated previously, it was concluded that the appellant had entered into
    a  marriage  of  convenience  with  Ms  K,  a  conclusion   that   went
    unchallenged. There is no proper basis on which I should go behind that
    finding and I do  not.  The  fact,  as  I  find  it  to  be,  that  the
    appellant's marriage to Ms  K  was  one  of  convenience  leads  me  to
    conclude that his relationship prior to the marriage  was  not  genuine
    and subsisting.

24. If I was wrong on the nature of the pre-marriage relationship, it would
    make no difference to the outcome of the case.

25. I find that whilst the appellant has established a private life in  the
    United Kingdom over the course of his relatively lengthy residence, the
    evidence provided as to the strength of that life is thin, to  say  the
    least. The bundle contains nothing of relevance to  this  issue  except
    for the appellant's brief witness statement. This contains very  little
    by way of detail. For example, there is nothing as to the  strength  of
    any friendships that might have been established. There is  nothing  to
    indicate family life connections in this country. There is no  evidence
    about any community  or  other  activities  undertaken.  There  are  no
    letters of support in the bundle.

26. On the basis of what I do have, I  find  that  the  appellant  has  not
    established  any  significant  relationships  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    whether in respect of relatives or friends. I find that he is  in  good
    health. I find that he has not undertaken any meaningful activities  in
    terms of social matters or otherwise.

27. I am prepared  to  accept  that  the  appellant  speaks  English  to  a
    reasonable level and that he has not been reliant on public funds.

28. In respect of the appellant's ties to Pakistan, I have  no  doubt  that
    she has family members living in that  country  and  maintains  contact
    with them. There is no reliable evidence to suggest that he  would  not
    receive support of one sort or another from his family  members  if  he
    were to return to Pakistan. I find that the speaks Urdu.



Conclusions

29. I now apply the factual matrix to the relevant legal framework.

30. I have found that the appellant  enjoys  private  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom, although I emphasise the fact that this is certainly not of  a
    particularly meaningful nature. There is no family life.

31.  I  am  prepared  to  accept  that  the  respondent's  refusal  of  the
    appellant's human rights claim constitutes  an  interference  with  the
    latter's private life.

32. It is accepted that the respondent's decision is in accordance with the
    law and pursues a legitimate aim.

33. As to proportionality, I weigh the following factors in the appellant's
    favour.

34. First, the appellant has been in the United Kingdom approximately 14  �
    years. That is a relatively lengthy period of time. Having  said  that,
    it is some way off the 20 years measure adopted by  the  respondent  in
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) of  the  Rules.  In  addition,  the  appellant
    arrived  in  this  country  well  into   adulthood   (aged   24)   and,
    notwithstanding the length of residence, has failed to show that he has
    established significant  ties  here.  Overall,  whilst  the  length  of
    residence does count in the appellant's favour,  it  does  not  attract
    significant weight.

35. Second, some of the residence in this country  has  been  on  a  lawful
    basis.

36. The following matters weigh on the respondent's  side  of  the  balance
    sheet.

37. First, the importance of maintaining effective immigration control is a
    weighty consideration (section 117B(1) NIAA 2002).

38. Second, it is plainly the case that the appellant is unable to meet any
    of the Article  8-related  Rules  (specifically,  paragraphs  276B  and
    276ADE). Included in this  is  the  absence  of  any  very  significant
    obstacles to integration into Pakistani society. This is  an  important
    consideration.

39. Third, when the appellant did have leave to remain it was always  on  a
    highly precarious basis (section 117B(5) NIAA 2002). There  is  nothing
    in this case which could sensibly be described as a compelling  feature
    such as  to  contribute  anything  other  than  little  weight  to  the
    appellant's private life established during his lawful residence.

40. Fourth, since 11 June 2010 the appellant has resided  in  this  country
    without leave to remain. It is right that he resided here for a  period
    in  possession  of  a  residence  card  issued  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016. However, it transpired  that
    his marriage to Ms  K  had  been  one  of  convenience  all  along  and
    therefore he never enjoyed a right of residence as the family member of
    an  EEA  national.  For  the  sake  of   completeness,   any   "durable
    relationship" which may  have  existed  pre-marriage  (contrary  to  my
    primary finding) did not give the appellant a right of residence as  he
    had never been issued with a residence card on this basis.

41. It follows that he has been in this country unlawfully  since  11  June
    2010 with the effect that his already thin private life attracts little
    weight (section 117B(4) NIAA 2002).

42. Fifth, far from assisting the appellant's case, the alleged "delay"  in
    the respondent issuing the certificate of approval for marriage in fact
    weighs in favour of the latter. There was nothing remotely unreasonable
    or otherwise significant about  the  51-week  time  it  took  for  that
    application to be determined. Further, and in any event, the conclusion
    of the First-tier Tribunal in 2018 that the appellant's marriage to  Ms
    K had been one of convenience wholly  undermines  any  (minimal)  value
    that the time it took to issue the certificate might have afforded  the
    appellant. It is manifestly the case that the appellant cannot  benefit
    from any perceived delay by the respondent in giving him permission  to
    enter  into  a  marriage  of  convenience.  Indeed,   the   appellant's
    misconduct in entering into the marriage of  convenience  adds  to  the
    already strong public interest.

43. The appellant's ability to speak English and his financial independence
    are of neutral value.

44. Bringing all of the above together, I have no hesitation in  concluding
    that the respondent's refusal of the  appellant's  human  rights  claim
    constitutes an entirely proportionate and fair striking of the  balance
    between the public interest and the rights protected under Article 8.

45. It follows that the appellant's appeal must be dismissed.



NOTICE OF DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of  law  and  it  is
set aside.
