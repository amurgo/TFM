For the Appellant: Mr Jafferji instructed by SKR Legal Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr Harrison - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Frankish, promulgated on 18th  December  2013,  in  which  he
        dismissed the appeals of this family unit against  the  refusal  of
        their applications for leave to enter the United  Kingdom  for  the
        purposes of settlement.


     2. The appellants are all citizens of Pakistan born  on  8th  December
        1973, 16th July 2001 and 30th August 2008  respectively.  They  are
        the wife and children of their sponsor Mr Duad Khan.


     3. The application by the first appellant was for leave as  a  partner
        under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and in  respect  of  the
        other two appellants as a child under Appendix FM.  The application
        of the first appellant was refused  under  the  provisions  of  EC-
        P.1.1(d) as it was said she had not provided the necessary evidence
        for the specified periods as stated in Appendix FM-SE.  As a result
        it  was  not  established  that  she  could  meet   the   financial
        requirements.  The applications of the  children  were  refused  in
        line with that of their mother.  The dates of decision are 9th  May
        2013. The Judge  notes  there  is  an  additional  claim  that  the
        decision will breach the applicants' human rights.


     4.  The  Judge  sets  out  his  findings  from  paragraph  7  of   the
        determination noting there was only one issue in the case which was
        whether the required sum of �24,800 had been demonstrated as  being
        available in the prescribed form over the  prescribed  period.  The
        requirement to demonstrate this is clearly set out in E-ECP 3.1  of
        the Rules which also sets out the nature of the  evidence  required
        to show that such income genuinely exists.


     5. The sponsor, who is providing funding, is  stated  to  be  a  self-
        employed person and so there was a requirement to produce  evidence
        of earnings for the previous twelve months or, failing  that,  two-
        year average which  the  Judge  found  the  sponsor  could  not  do
        especially as he only set up his pound shop in April  2012;  having
        spent a lot of time in Pakistan, including from 20th September 2011
        until 20th February 2012, a year to the day before the  application
        was submitted.


     6. The  Judge  sets  out  details  of  the  evidence  provided  before
        concluding in paragraph 12 that the application  is  premature  for
        the reasons set out in that paragraph. He  thereafter  went  on  to
        consider the human rights claim and found that Article  8  was  not
        engaged  although,  to  the  extent  it  was,   the   decision   is
        proportionate.


     7. The grounds seeking permission to appeal assert the Judge erred  in
        reducing the figure for the sponsor's self-employed  earnings  from
        �26,398 to �19,198 which the Judge stated was the correct figure as
        it represented the net income for tax  purposes  whereas  the  Rule
        requires a 'specified gross annual income'.  It  is  submitted  the
        documents provided show such income existed.


     8. The grounds also assert that earnings over a 12  month  period  was
        produced and a full year's end accounts, bank statements  etc  were
        provided in the bundle.  The grounds challenge the Judge's findings
        regarding post decision evidence as not being admissible and  claim
        the evidence provided reflected the circumstances  appertaining  at
        the date of decision and was therefore  admissible.  It  is  stated
        that as the business had been running successfully for  nearly  two
        years by the date of the hearing there was ample evidence that  the
        business was viable.


     9. The grounds are also critical of the Article  8  finding  which  is
        said to be inadequate as it failed to consider the  best  interests
        of the children and disruption to the sponsor's  business  was  not
        considered. Also that the family had adequate income  even  if  not
        able to satisfy the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
        Grounds assert the Judge failed to take into account  "the  leading
        case" of MM [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) in undertaking the  Article  8
        assessment.



Discussion



    10. The requirement under the Rules is for the  appellants  to  produce
        evidence with the  application,  by  the  production  of  specified
        evidence, to demonstrate the required minimum  level  of  financial
        support is available.  This is not an  abstract  exercise  but  one
        conducted to ensure that credible documents are  produced  enabling
        the decision maker to either have confidence that the claimed level
        of income is available for the specified period  and/or  to  enable
        checks to be undertaken with  recognised  institutions  who  it  is
        claimed have produced such documentation.


    11. Appendix FM-SE (A) states that the Appendix sets out the  specified
        evidence applicants  need  to  provide  to  meet  the  requirements
        contained in Appendix FM, indicating the need to do so  would  have
        been known to any applicant. Appendix  FM-SE  (D)  states  that  in
        deciding an application in relation to which this  Appendix  states
        that specified documents must  be  provided,  the  Entry  Clearance
        Officer or Secretary of State ("the decision maker") will  consider
        documents that have been submitted with the application,  and  will
        only consider  documents  submitted  after  the  application  where
        subparagraph  (b)  or  (e)  applies.   In  this  case  it  is   not
        established that either paragraph is applicable as  the  conditions
        in (b) are not shown to be met and  (e)  provides  that  where  the
        decision maker is satisfied that there is  a  valid  reason  why  a
        specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g. because  it  is  not
        issued in a particular country or has been permanently lost, he  or
        she may exercise discretion not to apply the  requirement  for  the
        document(s) or to request alternative or additional information  or
        document(s) to be submitted by the applicant.  In this case  it  is
        not established that there  was  any  valid  reason  why  specified
        document could not  be  supplied  other  than  the  fact  that  the
        documentary evidence did not exist at the date the application  was
        made due to the length of time the business  producing  the  income
        had been in existence.


    12. Mr Jafferji's argument that Appendix FM-SE (D) only applies  to  an
        Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of State and by inference  has
        no application to the Tribunal  as  appeals  to  the  Tribunal  are
        governed by statutory provisions, meaning later acquired  documents
        such as those the Appellants sought to rely upon can be considered,
        has no arguable merit.  The Rules require  the  information  to  be
        provided with the application and paragraph (D) makes it clear that
        in considering whether this requirement  has  been  fulfilled  only
        documents provided with the application will be  considered  unless
        an exception applies.  The question for the appeal tribunal is 'has
        the applicant proved that they are able to satisfy the requirements
        of the Rules by meeting the  specific  provisions  which,  in  this
        case, included providing evidence of the relevant level  of  income
        for the proscribed time by the provision  of  specific  documents?'
        Not whether the failure to do so can be remedied by evidence  dated
        after the date of application in relation to  matters  such  as  an
        income level which was not shown  to  exist  at  the  date  of  the
        application even if it came into existence as  a  result  of  later
        trading.


    13. The Rules provide a bright line in relation to the time  when  such
        evidence must be provided and for what period in the absence of the
        two specified provisions enabling other documents to be considered.
        The statutory provisions in entry clearance  applications  make  it
        clear  that  an  appeal  tribunal  is  considering   the   position
        appertaining to the date of decision with later  acquired  evidence
        not being admissible except in the circumstances  provided.   In  a
        case of this nature such evidence will still have to prove that  at
        the date of application the required level of income was  available
        by reference to specific evidence for the required period. That did
        not occur in this case.


    14. The Judge clearly considered the evidence with the degree  of  care
        required, that of anxious scrutiny, and gave adequate  reasons  for
        why the appellants were unable to satisfy the relevant  rules.   No
        legal error material to this element of the case has been proved.


    15. In relation to Article 8  ECHR:  it  is  submitted  the  Judge  was
        required to  do  more  than  he  did  as  it  is  asserted  it  was
        established in the evidence there was available a level  of  income
        sufficient to support the family and  that  all  relevant  elements
        should have been properly considered.


    16. I accept that the Judge's Article 8  findings  are  brief  but  the
        conclusion is that it had not been established that  the  necessary
        requirements to succeed under this provision had been met. The case
        relied upon in the grounds has been  overturned  by  the  Court  of
        Appeal in MM(Lebanon) and others [2014] EWCA Civ 985  it  which  it
        was said that in setting the maintenance limits  the  Secretary  of
        State  had  "discharged  the  burden  of  demonstrating  that   the
        interference was both the minimum  necessary  and  strikes  a  fair
        balance between the interests  of  the  groups  concerned  and  the
        community in general. Individuals will have different views on what
        constitutes the minimum income requirements  needed  to  accomplish
        the stated policy aims. In my judgment it is not the court's job to
        impose its own view unless, objectively judged, the  levels  chosen
        are to be characterised as  irrational,  or  inherently  unjust  or
        inherently unfair. In my view they cannot be".


    17.  In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
        640  (IAC)  (Mr  Justice  Cranston)  it  was  held  that  (i)   the
        maintenance requirements of E-LTRP.3.1-3.2 stand.


    18. The economic well being of the United Kingdom is a  legitimate  aim
        under Article 8 ECHR but before that is considered it is  necessary
        to establish whether there is a requirement to consider  Article  8
        is a freestanding element at all.  The family will remain separated
        but it has not been established that  they  cannot  continue  their
        family life in Pakistan as they  have  before.   It  has  not  been
        established that there are unjustifiably harsh consequences arising
        from the decision or that if Article 8 was to be  considered  as  a
        freestanding element  that  the  decision  would  be  found  to  be
        disproportionate; which was the Judges finding in the  alternative.
        No arguable material legal error is established.


    19. If the sponsor has now been trading for a two-year period  and  has
        the required minimum level of income  that  he  can  prove  by  the
        provision of specified documents, the family may  be  in  a  strong
        position in relation to the making of a fresh application. That is,
        however, a matter for them.


Decision

    20. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    21. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
