Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss L Appiah of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell - Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of China who was born on 26 March 1990.  She
    came to the United Kingdom on 19 September 2012 with leave to enter  as
    a student until 7 January  2013.   On  4  January  2013  she  made  an
    application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  4
    (General)  Student  Migrant  under  the  points-based   system.    This
    application was refused on the basis that she  claimed  10  points  for
    maintenance  (funds)  under  Appendix  C  of  the  Immigration   Rules.
    However, the documents she provided were dated more than a month  prior
    to the date of the application and therefore the Secretary of State was
    not satisfied that these documents met the requirements of  Appendix  C
    and thus awarded her no points.

 2. The appellant appealed that decision.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and  Article  8  ECHR.
    On a renewed application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  the  appellant  was
    granted leave to appeal that decision.  This was on the basis  that  in
    the judge's findings at paragraph 21 of the determination  with  regard
    to  the  appellant's  inability  to  meet  the  requirements   of   the
    Immigration Rules he failed to understand, and thus  to  make  findings
    on, the explanation given by the appellant as to the period covered  by
    a  Certificate  of  Deposit  of  funds.    Furthermore,   he   arguably
    misunderstood the reason  she  gave  for  being  able  subsequently  to
    produce an updated certificate.

 3. Before me I heard submissions from both representatives.  I made a full
    note of those submissions and have taken them into account in  arriving
    at my decision.

 4. I announced my decision at the hearing that the  judge's  determination
    contained errors such that the decision could not be safely relied on.

 5. In refusing  the  appellant's  application  the  respondent  stated  as
    follows:-

         "You made your application as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant on
         4 January 2013.  The Personal Certificate of Deposit  submitted  in
         support of your application is dated 09  November  2012.   This  is
         dated more than one month prior to your  application  date  and  as
         such, we are  unable  to  take  this  document  into  account  when
         assessing your funds.  Therefore you have not demonstrated that you
         have the level of  funds  required  to  be  granted  as  a  Tier  4
         (General) Student Migrant.

         Whilst a Personal Certificate of Deposit  certifies  that  from  09
         November 2012 to 16 February 2013 you have a deposit  account  with
         the Bank of China containing CNY 300,000.00 this cannot be accepted
         for your maintenance requirement as you  are  able  to  access  the
         funds at any  time,  so  the  amount  in  your  account  cannot  be
         guaranteed after 09 November 2012.

         Because of this you were sent an  email  on  20  February  2013  to
         request details of the funds in the account from 08  December  2012
         to 04 January 2013, however an email was  received  by  you  on  01
         March 2013 refusing to send the required information and requesting
         a decision to be made on the information already received.

         It  has  therefore  been  decided  that  you  have  not   met   the
         requirements as specified  within  the  Immigration  Rules  and  no
         points have been awarded for maintenance (funds)."

 6. The judge in the determination at paragraph 21 finds that the appellant
    has  failed  to  discharge  the  onus  upon  her  in  relation  to  the
    requirements of the Rules.  The reasons, he says, are set  out  clearly
    in the refusal letter.  The  appellant  was  given  an  opportunity  to
    rectify the situation and submit a further document which she failed to
    do.  The judge then, in essence, rejects  the  appellant's  explanation
    that she could not access funds without  being  physically  present  in
    China because she was able to submit a further document in an  original
    form at a later date  after  refusal.   However,  this  does  not  show
    necessarily that the appellant could  have  had  access  to  the  funds
    merely by being able to produce a further original document at a  later
    date.  Paragraph 3 of the notes contained  within  the  Certificate  of
    Deposit shows that the depositor deposited with the bank  for  a  fixed
    term which could not be  withdrawn  or  transferred  within  the  valid
    period of the certificate.  However, in paragraph 5 of the  same  notes
    is written the following as translated:-

         "The  recipient  of  this  certificate  shall  be  aware  that  the
         applicant of the certificate is entitled to  request  the  bank  to
         unfreeze the accounts  under  the  certificate  before  or  on  the
         closing date indicated therein upon  the  return  of  the  original
         certificate to the bank."

 7. The  judge  did  not  comment  upon  these  notes  and  their  possible
    importance to the appeal.

 8. Bearing in mind also that the appellant relied on  Article  8  and  the
    judge had before him a further document to show  that  the  same  funds
    were still in the account some months after the date of decision,  even
    if he was unable to take it into account, it did require that there  be
    a proper  assessment  of  the  Article  8  ECHR  position.   The  judge
    dismissed the  appeal,  however,  in  one  sentence  stating  that  the
    decision of the respondent is in his view proportionate.  This is not a
    situation where the appellant's claim was so hopeless that it could  be
    dismissed in that way and thus the judge erred.

The Further Hearing

 9. Having announced that I found that the judge made an unsafe decision  I
    checked that no further  evidence  was  to  be  given  and  no  further
    submissions were to be made  and  I  thereafter  reserved  my  decision
    having set aside the First-tier Tribunal Judge's one.

10. The concern in  the  refusal  letter  was  that  because  the  personal
    Certificate of Deposit submitted in  support  of  the  application  was
    dated more than one month prior to the  application  date  between  the
    date of the certificate of deposit and  the  date  of  application  the
    appellant was able to access the funds at any time. It is a requirement
    of the Rules that (in the appellant's case) she was  in  possession  of
    ï¿½10,794 for a consecutive 28 day period. As something of  an  aside  it
    does not appear to have been argued at any point that as the  appellant
    could not in effect access the funds unless she produced  the  original
    certificate and presented herself at the Bank of China (in  China)  she
    did not "have the required funds" etc. for the relevant period so I say
    no more about it.

11. It was accepted before me by Mr Whitwell on behalf  of  the  respondent
    that the original personal Certificate of Deposit was lodged  with  the
    respondent.  That shows that it is the equivalent of  a  term  account,
    contains CNY 300,000 which was deposited on 17 August 2012, and on the
    front page makes reference to the terms  and  conditions  on  the  back
    which are those contained in and referred to earlier  as  "notes".   On
    the face of it the appellant was unable to  withdraw  or  transfer  the
    money or any part of it between 9 November 2012 and 16 February 2013 as
    these are the dates shown on the certificate.  Although note 5 makes it
    a term and condition that the recipient of the certificate can  request
    the bank to unfreeze the accounts under the certificate  before  or  on
    the closing date, this was  always  on  the  basis  that  the  original
    certificate had to be returned to the bank.

12. The appellant was unable to request the bank to  unfreeze  the  account
    and return any or all  of  the  monies  to  her  because  the  original
    certificate was lodged and is still with, I  believe,  the  respondent.
    As a fact paragraph 1A(c) of Appendix C of the rules  states,  "If  the
    applicant is applying as a Tier 4 Migrant, the applicant must have  had
    the funds referred to in (a) above for a consecutive 28-day  period  of
    time".  (a) states, "The applicant must have the funds specified in the
    relevant part of Appendix C at the date of the application" and at  (h)
    "the end date of the 90-day and 28-day periods referred to in  (b)  and
    (c) above will be taken as the date of the closing balance on the  most
    recent of the specified documents (where specified documents  from  two
    or more accounts are submitted, this will  be  the  end  date  for  the
    account that most favours the applicant), and must be no  earlier  than
    31 days before the date of application."

13. The personal certificate of deposit certified that for a period from  9
    November 2012 to 16 February 2013 the appellant had deposited with  the
    Bank of China the equivalent of nearly three times the amount needed to
    show that she complied with the maintenance (funds) requirements of the
    Immigration Rules.  Although the start date for  the  certification  is
    more than 28 days prior to the date of application, the certificate  is
    in effect a continuing statement covering the period  of  the  date  of
    application.  To all intents and purposes the appellant could not  have
    access to the amount that she had deposited because one  of  the  terms
    and conditions was that the  original  certificate  would  have  to  be
    returned  to  the  bank.  This,  however,  was  in  possession  of  the
    respondent.

Conclusions

14. My conclusion is that this being the only part of the Immigration Rules
    that was in issue and the appellant has shown  that  she  has  complied
    with that part of the Immigration Rules, this appeal succeeds.

15. I mention that this was a matter where  the  respondent  wrote  to  the
    appellant on 20 February 2013 asking her to  provide  (in  essence)  a
    personal Certificate of Deposit between 8 December 2012 and  4  January
    2013 because the document provided was dated 9 November 2012  which  is
    more than 31 days prior to the application.  It would  have  been  easy
    enough, one would have thought, for the appellant to provide  what  was
    required of her.  Although there is reference to the appellant refusing
    to send the required information, I would not put  it  as  strongly  as
    that but to a large extent the appellant has herself to blame  for  not
    obtaining prior to  the  date  of  refusal  a  further  Certificate  of
    Deposit.  She was able to do so post decision, albeit with her  parents
    intervening to obtain it and the manager of the bank becoming involved.
     I draw comfort from the fact that the post decision evidence (which is
    not to be taken directly into account) shows that well after  the  date
    of decision the same amount that had been deposited  initially  by  the
    appellant was still in the account.  As a  fact  therefore  during  the
    period from well before the date of application and  until  well  after
    the date of decision shows that the  appellant  was  in  possession  of
    adequate maintenance (funds).

16. Because the appellant has met the requirements of the Immigration Rules
    I do not need to go on to consider the  Article  8  ECHR  position.   I
    note, however, that the appellant only came  into  the  United  Kingdom
    relatively recently and is unlikely to have made out a  strong  private
    life claim.

Decision

17. The First-tier Tribunal Judge erred  as  set  out  above  and  for  the
    reasons given the decision is set aside.

18. I substitute for the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  decision  that  this
    appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

19. I did not find that there is any need in the  particular  circumstances
    for an anonymity direction to be made.
