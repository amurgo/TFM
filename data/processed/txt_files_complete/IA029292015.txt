Officer
For the Respondent:    In person (through an interpreter)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  (SSHD)  was  granted
      permission to appeal the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which
      allowed Mr Vlacuha's appeal against a decision to make  a  deportation
      order on grounds  of  public  policy  in  accordance  with  regulation
      19(3)(b) and regulation 21 of the Immigration (European Economic Area)
      Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 EEA Regulations").


   2. The SSHD relied upon 3 grounds:


   a. That it was perverse of the judge to find that it was  speculation  on
      the part of the SSHD to find in the decision letter that the victim of
      the rape would be traumatised and may suffer long  term  psychological
      harm.
   b. That the suggestion that  Mr  Vlacuha  had  been  convicted  of  drink
      driving in the Czech Republic was not made out because  there  was  no
      PNC was perverse given the evidence of Mr Vlacuha and because  of  his
      conviction in the UK of driving whilst disqualified.
   c. The judge's approach to the evidence was suggestive of an  attempt  to
      minimise the seriousness of the offending and the Article  8  findings
      were inadequate; no attempt had been made to consider  whether  family
      life could continue in the Czech Republic.


   3. Mr Vlacuha has three convictions:
    . He was convicted of rape in the Czech Republic on 19th  November  1991
      for which he was sentenced to 2 years  suspended.  That  sentence  was
      subsequently converted into a custodial sentence;
    . He was convicted, in the Czech Republic  on  15th  February  1995,  of
      assault on a police officer  (driving  his  car  at  him)  failure  to
      support a dependant and unauthorised possession of property for  which
      he was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment;
    .  On 7th January 2014 in the UK he  was  convicted  of  driving  whilst
      disqualified and fined �150, driving licence endorsed with  6  penalty
      points, costs �85 and victim surcharge �20.


       Although it appears that the FtT was under a misapprehension  as  to
       the crimes committed by Mr Vlacuha, it was clear after questions put
       by me during the hearing that Mr Vlacuha agreed  that  he  had  been
       convicted of these offences.


   4. The FtT judge erred in his factual analysis of the offences for  which
      Mr Vlacuha had been convicted. The fact that there was no PNC does not
      mean, given the evidence of Mr Vlacuha, that he had not committed  the
      offence of assault against a police officer with his car. Although  Mr
      Vlacuha said that it was a minor offence that was treated as  a  major
      offence, the existence of the  offence  was  not  denied.  Mr  Vlacuha
      stated that it was because of that offence that the suspended sentence
      was converted to a custodial and that was why he served 44  months  in
      prison. Furthermore  a  conviction  for  driving  whilst  disqualified
      presupposes a prior sentence which consisted of disqualification  -  a
      likely sentence for the 1995 offence.


   5. The view expressed by the FtT judge that it  was  speculation  on  the
      part of the SSHD  to  conclude  that  the  victim  of  rape  had  been
      traumatised and  may  suffer  long  term  psychological  harm  is  not
      understandable. Although the circumstances of the rape were not known,
      what was known was that the victim was raped. It would be  speculation
      to consider that a victim of rape was not traumatised.


   6.  The  finding  of  the  judge  that  the  motoring  offence  was   not
      sufficiently prejudicial to the requirements of public policy  is  not
      explained. Mr Vlacuha was convicted of  driving  whilst  disqualified-
      that is a serious offence. That he was not  imprisoned  may  be  as  a
      result of mitigating factors  but  as  a  conviction  it  is  serious.
      Furthermore Mr Vlacuha has amassed three serious convictions  -  rape,
      driving a car at someone and driving whilst disqualified, albeit  over
      a lengthy number of  years.  The  judge  has  only,  in  reaching  his
      decision considered two offences - the rape in 1991  and  the  driving
      whilst disqualified in 2014.


   7. Ms Johnstone submitted that Mr  Vlacuha  had  failed  to  produce  any
      evidence that he had rehabilitated himself or that he was at low  risk
      of  committing  further  crime.  She  submitted  that  if  someone  is
      offending over a long period of time, as here, that  does  not  reduce
      the propensity to offend but rather increases it - even if the  nature
      of the crimes are different. She submitted that the judge  had  failed
      to consider the threat posed and that there was no evidence to support
      the judge's contention that the short period of immigration  detention
      had a deterrent  effect.  She  submitted  there  had  been  inadequate
      consideration of the proportionality of  deportation.  In  so  far  as
      Article 8 is concerned she submitted that there had been a failure  on
      the part of the judge to consider whether the family could  return  to
      live in the Czech Republic.


   8.  Mr  Vlacuha  does  not  have  permanent  residence  in  the  UK.  His
      deportation has to be justified  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,
      public  security  or  public  health.  Regulation  21  (5)  sets   out
      considerations that apply in the deportation of EEA nationals:


    . The decision must comply with the principle of proportionality
    . The decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of  the
      person concerned
    . The personal conduct of the person concerned must represent a genuine,
      present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one   of   the
      fundamental interests of society
    . Matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which  relate  to
      considerations of general prevention do not justify the decision
    . The person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in  themselves
      justify the decision.


    9.      The FtT judge,  although  directing  himself  to  the  required
       regulation has failed  to  accurately  or  adequately  consider  the
       evidence before him. His findings are unquestionably tainted by  his
       failure to take account of one serious conviction, by minimising the
       seriousness of the rape  conviction  and  categorising  the  driving
       offence in the UK as a 'transgression'. He simply failed to properly
       address  the  issue  of  whether  in  the  light  of  Mr   Vlacuha's
       convictions he was  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
       threat.


   10. I am satisfied the FtT judge erred  in  law  and  I  set  aside  the
       decision to be remade.


      Remaking the decision


   11. Both parties agreed that if I were to set aside the decision  to  be
       remade I had all the evidence I required to enable me to remake  the
       decision without a further hearing. The  submissions  made  by  both
       parties were before me and  I  took  account  of  all  the  material
       evidence.


   12. Mr Vlacuha has been convicted of three serious  offences,  the  fact
       that two took place in the Czech  Republic  does  not  prevent  them
       being  considered  in  any  assessment  of  the  proportionality  of
       deportation or issues of  personal  conduct  or  threat.  The  first
       offence has not been repeated either as a particular offence or  any
       type of sexual offence. It occurred 25 years ago  and,  given  there
       has been no repetition it is reasonable to conclude that despite the
       horror and seriousness of that offence, the applicant does not  have
       a propensity to commit that type of offence.


   13. That is not a similar consideration for the other two offences, both
       of which involved driving matters, one of which resulted in a period
       of imprisonment and the other a fine. That first driving matter  was
       however committed some 19 years ago. Regulation  21(5)  makes  clear
       that previous criminal convictions do not in themselves justify  the
       decision. It is important to consider the most recent conviction and
       the impact of that conviction along with the previous conviction  on
       the assessment of Mr Vlacuha's personal conduct  and  propensity  to
       commit crime. Were these two offences closer together in  time  this
       could indicate a propensity to commit crimes of this nature.  But  a
       time distance of 19 years with no intervening convictions  does  not
       tend towards a conclusion that Mr Vlacuha has a propensity to commit
       crimes of this nature. Even if the rape is taken  into  account  the
       time between the offences overall does not indicate a propensity (an
       inclination  or  tendency)  to  commit  crime  today.  Ms  Johnstone
       submitted that he had not provided any evidence of rehabilitation or
       evidence that he posed a low risk of further criminality and  whilst
       that is correct in terms of documentation, Mr Vlacuha's behaviour is
       indicative of rehabilitation and low risk. One offence  since  1995,
       albeit involving a driving offence  cannot  reasonably  be  seen  as
       indicative of a propensity towards further criminality.


   14. The decision is to be based exclusively upon Mr  Vlacuha's  personal
       conduct. Whilst the seriousness of the  offences  committed  by  him
       cannot be minimised, the lack of a tendency to commit further crimes
       means that he does not and cannot represent a  genuine  present  and
       sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the   fundamental
       interests of society.


   15. His wife and most of his children are in the UK. One of his children
       requires specialist treatment and education. It is  unclear  whether
       and to what extent any of the other children are working or  whether
       and to what extent his wife is working  but  in  the  absence  of  a
       genuine, present and serious threat  it  is  simply  not  lawful  to
       deport Mr Vlacuha.


   16. In so far as Article 8 is concerned, whilst the FtT judge  does  not
       refer to the possibility of continuing  family  life  in  the  Czech
       Republic, it is axiomatic that  if  it  is  unlawful  to  deport  Mr
       Vlacuha then his deportation would be a breach of Article 8.


   17.  I allow the appeal of Mr Vlacuha against the decision of  the  SSHD
       to deport him.


          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
