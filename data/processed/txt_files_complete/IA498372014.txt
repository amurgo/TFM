                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. The Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  (SSHD)  appeals
        against the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Boyes
        promulgated on 14 March 2016 in which she allowed, on human  rights
        grounds,  the  appeal  of  Laila,  daughter  of  Abdul  Satar  (the
        Claimant), against the SSHD's  decision  of  18  December  2014  to
        refuse her Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) as  a  domestic  worker
        and to remove her from the  UK  in  accordance  with  s.47  of  the
        Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


   Background


     2. The Claimant is a national of Afghanistan, date of  birth  01  July
        1978. She entered the UK on 19 February 2007 pursuant to a grant of
        entry clearance as a domestic worker. She was subsequently  granted
        further periods of leave to remain in the same category,  the  last
        of which was granted on 09 May 2013 and which  was  valid  until  3
        June 2014. On 19 May 2014 she made an  application  for  ILR  as  a
        domestic worker  in  a  private  household.  This  application  was
        refused on the basis that the Claimant had not passed the requisite
        Life in the UK test.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

     3. At her appeal before the FTT, heard on  9  December  2015,  it  was
        accepted on behalf of the Claimant that she had not passed the Life
        in the UK test and therefore could not meet the requirements for  a
        grant of ILR. It was additionally accepted by Mr Lee,  Counsel  for
        the Claimant, that, on the face of the evidence, she did  not  meet
        the national minimum wage requirements in respect of the terms  and
        conditions of her employment as a domestic worker.


     4. In her conclusions the judge found that the Claimant,  because  she
        had not passed the  Life  in  the  UK  test,  could  not  meet  the
        requirements of paragraph 159G(v) of the immigration rules.


     5. At [22] the judge stated:


         Whilst the [Claimant] does not specifically assert that a further
         grant of leave should be considered, in the alternative, under
         paragraph 159EA, I have gone on to consider whether she meets the
         substantive requirements to be granted further leave to remain
         under this paragraph.


     6. The judge noted that  paragraph  159EA(iii)  (requirements  for  an
        extension of stay as a domestic worker in a private  household  for
        applicants who entered the United Kingdom under the rules in  place
        before 6 April 2012) required that an applicant:


         ... continues to be required for employment for the period of  the
         extension sought as a  full-time  domestic  worker  in  a  private
         household under the same roof as  the  employer  or  in  the  same
         household that the employer has lived in  and  where  evidence  of
         this in the form of written terms and conditions of employment  in
         the UK as set out in Appendix 7 and  evidence  that  the  employer
         resides in the UK;


     7. Appendix 7 provides a template for written terms and conditions and
        includes the following declaration:

         Note: by signing this document, the employer is declaring that the
         employee will be paid in accordance with the National Minimum Wage
         Act 1998 and any regulations made under it for the duration of the
         employment.

     8. The judge referred to the Claimant's written terms  and  conditions
        of employment and two letters  that  had  been  provided  from  the
        Claimant's employer. These stated  that  the  Claimant  worked  six
        hours a day, 36 hours a week, and was paid �6.50 per hour, so  that
        her gross weekly wage was �234. The judge noted however  that  from
        the weekly wage, a deduction of �150 was made to cover the costs of
        accommodation, utilities, and water and laundry and  clothing.  The
        remaining �84 was sent to the Claimant's parents.  The  judge  then
        noted that the maximum weekly deduction for accommodation permitted
        under the national minimum wage provisions  was,  at  the  relevant
        time, �35.56. As other deductions for benefits in  kind  could  not
        count  towards  the  national  minimum  wage   the   Claimant   was
        effectively being paid significantly less than the national minimum
        wage. At [28] the  judge  concluded  that  none  of  the  documents
        provided by the Claimant relating to the terms  and  conditions  of
        her employment contained the required declaration.  The  judge  was
        consequently  satisfied  that  the  Claimant  could  not  meet  the
        requirements of paragraph 159 EA(iii) of the immigration rules.


     9. The judge then proceeded to consider the  appeal  on  human  rights
        grounds. At [40] the judge concluded that the Claimant did not meet
        the requirements of paragraph 276ADE as she had only lived  in  the
        UK for  just  under  nine  years  and  there  were  no  significant
        obstacles to her reintegration in Afghanistan. The judge noted that
        the Claimant's parents lived in Afghanistan, and that, as a 41-year-
        old single woman, she may find it difficult to find  employment  or
        to marry if removed. The judge concluded however that this was  not
        sufficient on its own to constitute  insurmountable  obstacles  for
        the purposes of  the  immigration  rules.  Although  there  was  no
        consideration by the judge of Appendix FM it was never contended by
        the Claimant that she could meet any of the  requirements  of  this
        provision.


    10. The judge then considered the  Claimant's  freestanding  Article  8
        claim with reference to the guidance identified  in  Razgar  [2004]
        UKHL 27. The judge noted that, when she entered the United  Kingdom
        in 2007, the Claimant was in a category that was capable of leading
        to settlement. The judge noted that the  Claimant  had  worked  and
        lived in the UK for a period of almost 9 years at the date  of  the
        hearing. She had, throughout that time, been employed by  the  same
        family. The judge found that the Claimant  had  undoubtedly  formed
        social ties in the UK during this period of residence and concluded
        that the Claimant enjoyed a private life in the UK capable of being
        interfered with by the SSHD's decision.


    11. Having found that the interference would have consequences of  such
        gravity so as to engage the operation of Article 8,  and  that  the
        interference was in accordance with the law and the legitimate  aim
        of securing the economic well-being of the UK, the judge went on to
        consider the issue of proportionality. In so doing the  judge  made
        reference to the public interest factors that need to be considered
        pursuant to sections 117A and 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration
        and Asylum Act 2002. The judge  was  satisfied  that  the  Claimant
        understood English as a result of  the  SSHD's  acceptance  of  her
        English language qualification. The judge was also  satisfied  that
        the Claimant could demonstrate that she was financially independent
        and that she had never been in receipt of public funds. At [39] the
        judge stated:


         She has been in the UK lawfully throughout the time that she has
         been in the UK and there is no suggestion that she has in any way
         breached immigration laws. I do not consider that her private life
         was established when her immigration status was precarious.


    12. At [42] of her decision the judge records  that  she  was  informed
        that the Claimant's terms and conditions of  employment  have  been
        broadly similar throughout the time that she has been  working  for
        her employer. The judge indicated that she had no reason to  doubt,
        on the evidence before her, that the  terms  had  remained  broadly
        similar as claimed, but as the judge had not been provided with the
        previous terms and conditions of employment she was unable to  make
        a finding of fact in this respect.

    13. At [43] the judge noted that the SSHD had appeared  satisfied  that
        the requirements of the amended rules were met  when  the  Claimant
        was last granted leave to remain on  9  May  2013.  The  judge  was
        satisfied, on the information before her,  that  the  Claimant  had
        never received any prior indication that there were  any  potential
        issues with the terms and conditions of her employment prior to the
        appeal hearing.


    14. At [44] & [45] the judge stated:


         I have considered whether, in all the circumstances, it is
         justified in the public interest, in particular the maintenance of
         effective immigration control, and proportionate, to remove the
         [Claimant] rather than instead granting her a short period of
         leave to provide her, and her employers, with the opportunity to
         demonstrate that she meets the requirements to be granted further
         leave to remain.


         The [Claimant] has been lawfully resident and lawfully in
         employment in the UK for almost 9 years. She is not presently in
         receipt of public funds. It appears that she has been granted a
         previous period of leave without any issues having been raised
         regarding the terms and conditions of her employment. It also
         appears that the respondent has never previously applied her mind
         to this issue, which raises the question of fairness.


    15. The judge concluded, having stated that she  had  weighed  all  the
        factors in the balance and given that the  Claimant  had  no  prior
        knowledge of the issue relating to the  terms  of  her  employment,
        that it would not be proportionate  for  the  SSHD  to  remove  the
        Claimant without first granting her a  short  period  of  leave  to
        enable her to make an application for further leave to remain as  a
        domestic worker under paragraph 159EA. The judge  appreciated  that
        any period of leave was a matter for the SSHD but suggested that  a
        period of 28 days may  be  proportionate.  The  judge  consequently
        allowed the appeal on human rights grounds on the limited basis  as
        specified by her.


      The grant of leave to appeal


    16. In her grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal the  SSHD  contended
        that the judge materially misdirected herself  in  concluding  that
        the Claimant's immigration status was not precarious in light of AM
        (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260. As a result it was submitted  that
        the judge failed to have regard to s.117B(5)  of  the  Nationality,
        Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and failed to give little weight to
        the Claimant's private life.


    17. The grounds additionally dispute the  judge's  conclusion  that  an
        issue of  fairness  arose  as  the  Claimant  could  have  made  an
        adjournment application to deal with the terms and  conditions  and
        minimum wage point raised at the hearing and because, according  to
        paragraph 6 of the decision, it was  the  Claimant  who  raise  the
        issue about further leave to remain in her section 120 notice.  The
        grounds contended that there had not  been  an  adequate  balancing
        exercise conducted in respect of proportionality.


    18. In granting permission to appeal the FTT stated:


         It is arguable that the judge's decision at paragraph 39 is
         fundamentally flawed when he [sic] states "I do not consider her
         private life was established when her immigration status was
         precarious." Although the judge has taken into account s.117B he
         [sic] seems to have ignored on the facts the appellant's
         immigration status was precarious.


         It is also arguable as to whether the judge had the power to allow
         the appeal to the limited extent he [sic] indicates.

The Upper Tribunal hearing

    19. In his submissions Mr Duffy reiterated that the judge's  conclusion
        that the Claimant's leave to remain had never been  precarious  was
        inconsistent  with  AM  (S  117B)  Malawi  and  s.117B(5)  of   the
        Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Mr  Duffy  submitted
        that  the  judge  had  improperly  used  Article  8  as  a  general
        dispensing power in light of her finding that a new issue had  been
        raised at the hearing. It was submitted that this was  an  improper
        use of Article 8. The judge had already  found  that  the  Claimant
        could not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE, and she had no
        family life in the United Kingdom. It was difficult to see how  the
        appeal could be allowed in circumstances where the  Claimant  could
        not meet any of the immigration  rules  resulting  in  a  grant  of
        either indefinite leave to remain or further leave to remain for  a
        domestic worker in the Claimant circumstances. It  was  noted  that
        the Claimant could make a further application for leave  to  remain
        even if her appeal was dismissed as any period of overstaying for a
        period of 28 days or less would be disregarded  by  the  SSHD  (see
        paragraph 159EA(vi)).


    20. On behalf of the Claimant Mr Butterworth contended that  the  judge
        gave an in-depth consideration  to  all  relevant  factors  in  her
        assessment outside of the immigration rules. My attention was drawn
        to [36] where the judge found that the Claimant had  established  a
        private life. I was referred to [38] et seq where the  requirements
        of s.117B were considered, and in  particular  to  [44]  where  the
        judge applied her mind directly to the issue of Article  8  outside
        the immigration rules. It was submitted that the judge had properly
        considered all relevant factors relevant to proportionality at [39]
        and [45] including the fact that she had lived in the UK  for  nine
        years, had never been in receipt of public funds, had  always  been
        lawfully employed,  was  proficient  in  English,  was  financially
        independent, had never breached the immigration rules, and had been
        unfairly treated. It  was  submitted  that  any  assessment  as  to
        whether the Claimant's immigration status was precarious had to  be
        assessed across a spectrum. In assessing whether the FTT  erred  in
        law I was urged to apply  the  principles  in  Edwards  v  Bairstow
        [1956] AC 14, as recently applied  in  Dasgupta  (error  of  law  -
        proportionality - correct approach) [2016] UKUT 00028 (IAC).


    21. At the conclusion of the hearing  I  reserved  my  decision  and  I
        granted Mr Butterworth permission  to  adduce  further  submissions
        relating to the interplay between the assertion of  unfairness  and
        Article 8. These further submissions were to be provided by Friday,
        14 October 2016. Mr Duffy was given until Tuesday, 18 October  2016
        to serve any reply. Mr  Butterworth  provided  further  submissions
        within the prescribed time and I have taken these into account.  Mr
        Duffy did not provide any reply.

Discussion

    22. It is pertinent to note at the outset of my assessment  of  whether
        the First-tier Tribunal judge materially erred in law  in  allowing
        the appeal under Article 8 that she found that the  Claimant  could
        not succeed under any of the immigration rules  identified  by  the
        SSHD as giving  expression  to  Article  8  rights  and  containing
        Article 8 considerations. The judge specifically concluded that the
        Claimant could did not meet the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  or
        paragraph 276. At [33] of SSHD v SS (Congo) & Ors [2015]  EWCA  Civ
        387 Richards LJ indicated  that  'compelling  circumstances'  would
        need to be identified to support a grant of Leave To Remain outside
        the new rules.


    23. To have been entitled to allow the appeal under Article 8 the judge
        needed  to  be  satisfied  as  to  the  existence  of   'compelling
        circumstances' relating to the  private  life  established  by  the
        Claimant in the UK. The decision contains no detailed assessment of
        any difficulties that the Claimant  may  encounter  if  removed  to
        Afghanistan. The judge did not engage in a detailed  assessment  of
        the nature and extent  of  the  private  life  established  by  the
        Claimant other than to say that the Claimant had lived  in  the  UK
        for nine years, that she had developed ties, in particular with the
        family who employed her,  and  that  she  had  never  breached  the
        immigration rules. In assessing the  Claimant's  circumstances  the
        judge noted that she spoke English,  was  financially  independent,
        and had been granted leave to remain in a category that could  lead
        to settlement. As  a  consequence  of  the  last  point  (that  the
        Claimant entered the  UK  in  a  category  capable  of  leading  to
        settlement) the judge concluded  that  the  Claimant's  immigration
        status was not precarious. This conclusion is flatly contrary to  a
        reported decision of the Vice-President of the Upper Tribunal.


    24. In AM (S 117B) Malawi the Upper Tribunal held, at headnotes (4) and
        (5):
         (4) Those who at any given date held a precarious immigration
         status must have held at that date an otherwise lawful grant of
         leave to enter or to remain. A person's immigration status is
         "precarious" if their continued presence in the UK will be
         dependent upon their obtaining a further grant of leave.
         (5) In some circumstances it may also be that even a person with
         indefinite leave to remain, or a person who has obtained
         citizenship, enjoys a status that is "precarious" either because
         that status is revocable by the Secretary of State as a result of
         their deception, or because of their criminal conduct. In such
         circumstances the person will be well aware that he has imperiled
         his status and cannot viably claim thereafter that his status is
         other than precarious.
    25. Mr Butterworth did not challenge the correctness of the decision in
        AM (S 117B) Malawi. Rather, he submitted that any assessment as  to
        whether a person's immigration  status  is  precarious  had  to  be
        considered along a spectrum and that the immigration status of  one
        individual may be more or  less  precarious  than  the  immigration
        status of another individual. Whilst I accept  that  an  individual
        who enters the UK in a category capable of  leading  to  settlement
        may hold an expectation that, if all the relevant  requirements  of
        the immigration rules are met, they would  be  granted  settlement,
        that person status must  still  be  regarded  as  being  precarious
        because it is dependent on a set of circumstances being established
        in the future. I cannot see how  the  FTT  judge  was  entitled  to
        conclude that the Claimant's immigration status was anything  other
        than precarious. The very fact that the Claimant did not  meet  the
        requirements  for  settlement  demonstrate  that  her  status   was
        precarious. Section 117B(5) does not make any distinctions  between
        levels of precariousness and I see no basis  for  imposing  such  a
        restriction. As the Claimant's immigration  status  was  unarguably
        precarious the judge was required, by operation of primary statute,
        to  attach  little  weight  to  the  private  life  that  she   had
        established in the UK. This is something that the judge did not do.
        This constitutes a material misdirection of law. The  judge  failed
        to carry out a lawful assessment under Article 8 because she failed
        to attach due weight to the public interest factors.


    26. I am also satisfied that the  judge  materially  erred  in  law  by
        applying Article 8 as if it were  a  general  dispensing  power  to
        counteract a perceived unfairness arising from an issue  raised  on
        the day of the hearing which was relevant to whether the  Applicant
        could meet the requirements for a grant of Further Leave to  Remain
        as a domestic worker under paragraph 159EA.


    27. In her statement  dated  4  December  2015,  at  paragraph  9,  the
        Claimant requested that the FTT allow  her  appeal  and  grant  her
        Further Leave to Remain as she believed she still met the  relevant
        requirements for Leave to Remain as a domestic worker. The  natural
        inference from this paragraph is that the  Claimant  was  asserting
        that she met the requirements for Further  Leave  to  Remain  as  a
        domestic worker i.e. the requirements of paragraph  159EA.  If  the
        Claimant was asserting that she met the  requirements  for  Further
        Leave to Remain as a domestic worker under paragraph  159EA  it  is
        reasonable to assume  that  she  should  have  been  aware  of  the
        particular requirements of that paragraph. If one asserts that  one
        meets the requirements of a particular immigration rule one must be
        prepared to demonstrate such compliance in an appeal hearing.


    28. At [16] the judge noted  the  submission  made  by  the  Claimant's
        representative that the "fairest approach" in circumstances where a
        new issue about the minimum wage requirements  was  raised  at  the
        hearing would be for the SSHD to grant the Claimant a short  period
        of leave to enable the difficulties surrounding  her  wages  to  be
        resolved. It appears from [6] that the  issue  as  to  whether  the
        Claimant could meet the requirements for Further Leave  to  Remain,
        and the concern surrounding whether she was being paid the national
        minimum wage, was raised by the judge and the  Presenting  Officer,
        although the Claimant had already asserted in her statement  of  04
        December 2015 that she met the requirements for leave to remain  as
        a domestic worker. It is also apparent from [7] that the Claimant's
        Counsel was made aware of this at the outset of the hearing and was
        given an opportunity to make an adjournment request.  Counsel  took
        instructions and indicated that he  was  content  to  proceed.  The
        Applicant was therefore given an opportunity to seek an adjournment
        in light of the issues raised at the hearing and chose  to  proceed
        with  the  appeal.  I  am  consequently  satisfied  there  was   no
        procedural  unfairness   to   the   Claimant   arising   from   the
        circumstances in which her inability to meet the  requirements  for
        Further Leave to Remain under paragraph 159EA was raised.


    29. Despite this the judge concluded that, as the  Respondent  appeared
        to have never previously applied her mind to whether  the  Claimant
        had, in the past, met the requirements of paragraph 159EA  relating
        to the declaration concerning the minimum wage  requirements,  this
        raised issues  of  'fairness'  sufficient  to  render  her  removal
        disproportionate.


    30. In Patel and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72, Lord Carnwath stated, at
        [57]:

         It is important to remember that Article 8 is not a general
         dispensing power. It is to be distinguished from the Secretary of
         State's discretion to allow leave to remain outside the Rules,
         which may be unrelated to any protected human right.

    31. It is also clear that Article 8 cannot be used to fill any  gap  in
        the failure to comply with the immigration  rules  (see  CDS  (PBS:
        "available": Article 8) Brazil [2010] UKUT 305 (IAC) and MM and  SA
        [2010] UKUT 481 (IAC)).


    32. The First-tier Tribunal judge has, in my judgement, treated Article
        8 as a general dispensing power because of a  perceived  unfairness
        to the Claimant. It was not argued on behalf of the  Claimant  that
        any failure by the Respondent in the past to properly consider  the
        terms and conditions of the Claimant's employment, which  may  have
        inadvertently led to further grants of Leave to Remain, generated a
        legitimate expectation upon which the Claimant could rely and which
        would render any refusal to  grant  her  Further  Leave  to  Remain
        legally unfair. The Claimant must be taken to have  been  aware  of
        the requirements she needed  to  fulfil  in  order  to  be  granted
        Further Leave to Remain under paragraph 159EA.  She  was  given  an
        opportunity of requesting an adjournment to deal with the point but
        no such application was made.


    33. In his further written submissions Mr  Butterworth  submitted  that
        issue of 'fairness' was a relevant factor in determining whether  a
        decision was in accordance  with  the  law  or  whether  or  not  a
        decision struck a fair balance under  Article  8.  The  cases  upon
        which Mr Butterworth relies (such as Patel (revocation  of  sponsor
        licence - fairness) India [2011] UKUT 211 (IAC)) concern  instances
        of  clear  procedural  unfairness  occasioned  by  the  SSHD.   The
        decisions relied on by Mr Butterworth can however be  distinguished
        from the present appeal  on  the  basis  that  there  has  been  no
        demonstrable procedural unfairness by the SSHD in her dealings with
        the Claimant. The Claimant is required to fulfil the conditions  of
        the immigration rules and the SSHD cannot  be  said  to  be  acting
        unfairly in requiring those conditions to be met. The SSHD has  not
        imposed any onerous  or  procedurally  unfair  requirement  on  the
        Claimant. I am satisfied that no  procedural  unfairness  has  been
        identified sufficient to entitle the judge  to  conclude  that  the
        Claimant's removal would be disproportionate without giving  her  a
        short opportunity to make  an  application  for  Further  Leave  to
        Remain under paragraph 159EA.


    34. It is open to the Claimant to make such  an  application  once  her
        appeal rights are exhausted. Paragraph 159EA(vi) indicates that the
        SSHD will disregard any period of overstaying for a  period  of  28
        days or less. It is to be noted that this is  the  same  period  of
        time  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  considered   may   be
        appropriate to grant to the Claimant. There is therefore nothing to
        stop the Claimant from sorting out the  evidence  relating  to  the
        minimum wage requirements and  making  a  further  application  for
        leave to remain under paragraph 159EA.


    35. In his further written submissions Mr Butterworth invited the Upper
        Tribunal to remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal on the
        basis that the appeal concerned an issue  of  procedural  fairness.
        For the reasons I have already I am not satisfied that there is any
        issue of procedural fairness. Nor is there anything preventing  the
        Claimant from making a further application on the  basis  described
        at the end of the preceding paragraph. In these circumstances I can
        see no reason why the matter should be remitted to  the  First-tier
        Tribunal.  The  Claimant  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of   the
        immigration  rules  and,  for  the  reasons  given,  there  are  no
        compelling circumstances sufficient to entitle the  Claimant  to  a
        grant of leave outside  the  immigration  rules  on  the  basis  of
        Article 8.


    36. The SSHD's appeal is allowed. I remake the  appeal  dismissing  the
        Claimant's appeal.
