For the appellant:     Mr J Gajjar of Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens  of  Bangladesh  and  are  a  family.  They
    appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent dated 30 June 2016 to refuse to grant them leave  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom under paragraph  276ADE  and  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights. First Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Wyman
    dismissed the appellants' appeal in a decision dated 10 January 2018.


 2. Permission to appeal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Norton
    Taylor on 1 January 2018 stating that it is  arguable  that  the  first
    appellant's  immigration  history   was   not   adequately   addressed.
    Furthermore, the Judge's Reasonable assessment under section  117B  (6)
    of the 2002 Act is flawed. The  Judge  appears  to  have  confused  the
    consideration of paragraph 276 ADE (1) (iv) with that  of  section  11B
    (6). In this case the relevant child was not qualified as at  the  date
    of the human rights claim but had been in the United Kingdom  for  8  �
    years as at the date of hearing. Further whilst the Judge  states  that
    "significant weight" had been attributed to the residence factor of the
    child, it was stated that the relevant residence was a matter  only  of
    "some weight". Finally, it is difficult to discern  whether  the  Judge
    posed and then answered the core questions relating to the existence of
    "powerful reasons" which might have outweighed the  significant  factor
    of the 8 � years of residence.


    First-tier Tribunal's findings


 3. The Judge made the following findings in his decision which in  summary
    are the following.

          I. The facts of the case are not in dispute. All  the  appellants
             are Bangladesh nationals. The  first  appellant  came  to  the
             United Kingdom as a student in 2007. He was joined by his wife
             in 2008. He was subsequently granted further leave  to  remain
             until 2015, although this leave was curtailed until 2014.  All
             three children were born  in  the  United  Kingdom.  Only  the
             eldest child, Iqra has had any leave  to  remain  as  she  was
             granted leave in  line  with  her  parents.  The  younger  two
             children have never been granted any leave to remain.


         II. It is accepted that the first  appellant  has  a  genuine  and
             subsisting relationship with his wife as they married in  2007
             and have been now married for  approximately  10  years.  They
             have three children of the marriage. However, the family would
             be returned together, as a family unit  to  Bangladesh,  where
             the family are all nationals.  The  parents  spent  all  their
             formative years in Bangladesh and had spent  the  majority  of
             their lives in that country. The parents have  their  parents/
             parent and siblings in Bangladesh. They have no family in this
             country.


        III. The first appellant is a  qualified  lawyer  from  Bangladesh.
             Since he has come to the United Kingdom  he  has  successfully
             qualified  as  a  solicitor  and  is  fluent  in  English.  He
             explained that he wished to qualify as  a  barrister  but  has
             failed to do so. He also  claims  that  he  cannot  return  to
             Bangladesh   and   work   without   having    a    barrister's
             qualification. In his view, the general public  in  Bangladesh
             know the term advocate and barrister but do not know the  term
             solicitor. The first appellant has  provided  no  evidence  of
             this whatsoever. Nor has he explained why he  could  not  work
             for either a firm of solicitors or barristers  in  Bangladesh.
             It is also unclear why he did not qualify as a barrister given
             that he had leave to remain as  a  student  for  seven  years.
             Instead he chose to qualify as a solicitor and only  then  did
             he seek  to  qualify  as  a  barrister.  If  qualifying  as  a
             barrister was so important to him, it is surprisingly that  he
             did not make every effort to qualify as a barrister  prior  to
             becoming a solicitor.


         IV. The first appellant has not explained why there would be  very
             significant obstacles for him to return to Bangladesh with his
             family. He has a large family in Bangladesh both on  his  side
             and on his wife's side.  His  wife  studied  as  a  lawyer  in
             Bangladesh before coming to the United  Kingdom,  so  she  may
             have legal connections in Bangladesh of  her  own.  Therefore,
             the parents do not the requirements of paragraph 276 ADE  (vi)
             of the immigration rules.


          V. The Judge then went on to consider the position of  the  three
             children. In respect of the eldest child, she was eight  years
             old at the date of hearing. She was granted  leave  to  remain
             for the past five years of her life until August 2014. The two
             youngest children have never had any period of leave.  So  far
             as the parents do not have  any  leave,  the  children  cannot
             qualify for leave under the immigration rules.


         VI. In respect of the eldest child, she meets  paragraph  276  ADE
             (iv) as although she is under the age of  18,  she  has  lived
             continuously in the United Kingdom for at least  seven  years.
             The question is whether it would be reasonable to  expect  her
             to leave the United Kingdom. Section 55 states that  the  best
             interests of the children are a primary  concern  in  decision
             making. It was noted in Azami Moyed that seven years from  the
             age of 4 is likely to be more important to the child then  the
             first seven years of life. Very young children are focused  on
             their parents rather than their peers and are  adaptable.  The
             eldest child has lived in the United  Kingdom  for  more  than
             seven years, but not for seven years from the age  of  4.  The
             other two children have not lived in the  United  Kingdom  for
             seven years. The child has been  in  the  United  Kingdom  for
             seven years, this is a factor of "some weight"  which  is  not
             seen as an "automatic win".


        VII. The first  appellant's  immigration  status  has  always  been
             precarious. As of 2014, the first appellant has had  no  leave
             and therefore has not been working. He has  therefore  been  a
             burden of the state. Furthermore, his wife and  children  have
             used the services of the NHS, when they did not have leave, at
             a considerable cost to the public.  The  appellant  said  that
             they are integrated into the United Kingdom  the  letter  from
             her friends provided and the second appellant  confirmed  that
             their friends are Bangladesh.


       VIII. This is a case with the children will be returning with  their
             parents country where both parents are very familiar with  the
             Bengali way of life, culture and language and  have  lived  in
             Bangladesh longer than they have in  the  United  Kingdom.  In
             contrast, the family have extensively used the NHS.


         IX. The first appellant came to the United Kingdom  as  a  student
             and his intention was that he would return to  Bangladesh  and
             his explanation that he will not be able to work in Bangladesh
             is not accepted.


          X. It is acknowledged that the eldest  child  has  lived  in  the
             United Kingdom for seven years,  "I  have  given  this  matter
             significant weight in the proportionality exercise". "I do not
             find that this is a compelling reason to allow the children or
             their parents to remain in the United Kingdom". If the  eldest
             child is 11 years old and lived here for seven years from  the
             age of four, this would have been a more  cogent  reason.  She
             would have at 11 starting  secondary  school.  Therefore,  the
             application to remain under the immigration rules is dismissed
             for the eldest child.


         XI.  In  respect  of  Article  8,   there   are   no   exceptional
             circumstances in this  case  and  they  cannot  succeed  under
             article 8 when  they  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  the
             immigration rules.


        XII.  The  Judge  dismissed  the  appellants   appeal   under   the
             Immigration Rules and under Article 8.



    Grounds of appeal


 4. As at the date of the first appellant's entry into the  United  Kingdom
    on 18 January 2015, he had valid leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
    Before the expiry of his last period of leave, it was curtailed  on  14
    November 2014. The first appellant submitted an application for further
    leave to remain on 17 January 2015 and included an  application  for  a
    fee exemption made in accordance with the respondent's  policy.  On  17
    April 2015 the respondent wrote to the  appellant  asking  for  further
    evidence in connection with the application for a waiver  of  the  fee.
    The respondent replied stating that the fees will  not  be  waived  and
    that his application therefore is not valid for  non-payment  of  fees.
    The first appellant made a further application for fees  to  be  waived
    which was also refused and his application it was  considered  invalid.
    On 10  December  2015,  the  first  appellant  and  his  family  member
    submitted a further application for leave to remain  on  the  basis  of
    their private life and again made an application for a  waiver  of  the
    application fees. This application was again rejected by the respondent
    on 10  December  2015.  The  first  appellant  submitted  a  pre-action
    protocol  letter  to  the  respondent  for  judicial  review  and   the
    respondent accepted to waive the fees.


 5. On 30 June 2016 the respondent issued a substantive  decision  refusing
    the appellants applications. Is important  to  note  that  whilst  this
    appeal was pending, the first appellant acquired a period of  10  years
    of continuous residence in the United Kingdom.


 6. It is therefore  argued  that  the  first  appellant  was  entitled  to
    indefinite leave to remain on the  grounds  of  having  established  10
    years lawful residence in the United Kingdom because at  all  times  he
    had  3C  leave.  All  his  applications  for  fee  waiver  should  have
    considered as valid.


 7. In the alternative and if the first appellant did not  have  continuous
    3C leave, the Judge materially erred by failing to factor this apparent
    injustice in the assessment of  the  Article  8  rights  of  the  first
    appellant and  his  family.  The  Judge  misconceived  the  appellant's
    immigration history and considered the first appellant's overstay  with
    undue  harshness  by  not  affording  the  due  weight  to  the   first
    appellant's compliance with the immigration rules for the  majority  of
    his stay in the United Kingdom.


 8. The Judge failed to assess  the  appellant's  and,  in  particular  the
    eldest child having resided in the United Kingdom  for  the  entire  8�
    years of her life. The Judge had a duty to assess  her  best  interests
    within the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  Kaur  (children's  best
    interests/public interest interface) [2017] UKUT  00014  (IAC)  it  was
    stated that every case of  this  kind,  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise, the scales are evenly balanced that the best interests of  an
    affected child feature in the balancing exercise. It is incumbent  upon
    the court  or  Tribunal  concerned  to  make  an  assessment  of  those
    interests.


 9. The next ground was that is that the  Judge  dealt  very  briefly  with
    article 8 outside the immigration rules concluding  that  the  lack  of
    exceptional circumstances dictated that the  appeal  should  fail.  The
    failure to properly assess Article 8 of the rules is a clear  error  of
    law.


10. The Judge's proportionality assessment of  the  eldest  child  who  has
    resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  more  than  seven   years   was
    inconsistent with the decision in MA Pakistan [2016] EWCA Civ 705 which
    stated that the child who has had seven years residence must  be  given
    significant weight. Furthermore, parental  immigration  conduct  should
    not be a reason not to grant leave as the child's best interests should
    be assessed in isolation of their conduct.


11. The Judge also dead not identify  the  powerful  reasons  for  why  the
    eldest child should leave the country.  The  first  appellant  and  his
    family other than receiving medical treatment have not been a burden on
    the taxpayer.


    The hearing

12. I heard submissions from both parties  at  the  hearing  which  I  have
    considered. The appellant's counsel said that  the  Judge  has  made  a
    wrong finding of fact that the first appellant was  unlawfully  in  the
    United Kingdom. The first appellant had valid  leave  to  remain  as  a
    student. He made several applications fee waiver which was not  granted
    by the respondent until he wrote a pre-action protocol  respondent  who
    then finally agreed to waive the fees. The Judge also  failed  to  make
    findings as to the best interests of the children in  respect  of  s55.
    The Judge confused 276 ADE with 117B (6).  There  was  nothing  in  the
    decision as to what the powerful reasons for the eldest child  were  to
    require her to leave the United Kingdom.


13. Miss Lindsey on behalf of the respondent stated  that  the  appellant's
    leave was curtailed in 2014 after which he  had  no  further  leave  to
    remain. The first appellant accepted  in  the  skeleton  argument  that
    lawful residence was interrupted. There has been no  challenge  to  the
    decisions of the respondent to refuse fee  waiver.  The  Judge  made  a
    proper assessment under the immigration rules and Article 8. The  Judge
    took into account the public interest when he stated that the appellant
    has used the NHS to which they were not entitled. The Judge  considered
    that child private life is more relevant from the age of 4 to  11.  The
    Judge gave a substantial degree of weight to the child's residence.

        Decision on error of law

14. In considering this appeal I have taken into  account  the  case  of R
    (Iran) v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 982, where Brooke LJ summarised  at  [9]
    the errors on points of law that will most frequently be encountered in
    practice:

         "9.      ...


         (i)      making perverse or irrational  findings  on  a  matter  or
         matters that were material to the outcome ("material matters");


         (ii)     failing to  give  reasons  or  any  adequate  reasons  for
         findings on material matters;


         (iii)    failing to take into account and/or resolve  conflicts  of
         fact or opinion on material matters;


         (iv)     giving weight to immaterial matters;


         (v)      making a material misdirection  of  law  on  any  material
         matter;


         (vi)      committing  or   permitting   a   procedural   or   other
         irregularity capable of making a material difference to the outcome
         or the fairness of the proceedings;


         (vii)    making a mistake as to a  material  fact  which  could  be
         established by objective  and  uncontentious  evidence,  where  the
         appellant and/or his advisers were not responsible for the mistake,
         and where unfairness resulted from the  fact  that  a  mistake  was
         made."



15. The First-tier Tribunal Judge in a careful decision considered all  the
    evidence in the appeal and found that the appellants  could  return  to
    Bangladesh and continue their private and family life in that  country,
    as a family unit. What is the best of interests of a  qualifying  child
    has to be determined taking into account all the  likely  circumstances
    of the qualifying child if returned as a family unit to Bangladesh. The
    Judge hard to take  into  account  all  the  factors  relevant  to  the
    appellant's qualifying child's well-being if returned to Bangladesh.



16. The grounds of appeal essentially state that the Judge did not consider
    the best interests of the eldest qualifying child who has been in  this
    country for over seven years because at the date of  the  hearing,  she
    was eight years old. The two other children were under the age of seven
    and therefore not qualified  children.  Therefore,  the  case  for  the
    appellants claim for leave to remain rested on the  best  interests  of
    the 8� year-old child.


17. It was asserted that the Judge made a mistake of fact  when  he  stated
    that the first appellant has been in this country unlawfully. The facts
    are that the first appellant's student leave was curtailed the 2014 and
    it was also accepted in the skeleton argument that his continued  leave
    was interrupted. The first appellant made  many  applications  for  fee
    waiver which were refused by the respondent. The Judge in the  decision
    sets out the first appellant's immigration  history  and  there  is  no
    material error in this regard because he considered the best  interests
    of  the  qualifying  child  independently  to  the  First   appellant's
    immigration history.


18. It is also clear from the case of MA Pakistan [2016] EWCA Civ 705, that
    the fact that there is a qualified child is  a  relevant  consideration
    and one that might be said to point to it being in the  child  interest
    to remain in the United Kingdom, but  it  is  equally  clear  that  the
    assessment of reasonableness must take account of the  conduct  of  the
    claimant and his wife.  To  make  an  adequate  legally  and  factually
    finding, a proper assessment of the best interests of the child must be
    based on a careful consideration of the  likely  circumstances  of  the
    children, if returned as a unit to Bangladesh. Therefore, the Judge was
    entitled to take into account all the circumstances of this family  and
    there was  no  material  error  because  the  qualifying  child's  best
    interests were carefully considered over and above all else.



19.  The  ultimate  question  in  this  appeal  was  whether  it  would  be
    unreasonable for the family to leave the United  Kingdom  as  a  family
    unit taking into account the best interests of  the  qualifying  child.
    The  Judge  also  considered  whether  there  were  any  insurmountable
    obstacles to the family relocating to Bangladesh.


20. To that end the Judge considered the fate of the qualified child if she
    were to be returned to Bangladesh with her  parents  and  siblings.  In
    order to  answer  that  question,  the  Judge  considered  the  earning
    capacity of her parents because this would  inform  the  Judge  of  the
    qualifying child's well-being on her return to  Bangladesh.  The  Judge
    that regard took into account that both parents  are  lawyers  and  the
    first appellant is a qualified solicitor in this country. The Judge was
    entitled to reject the evidence  of  the  first  appellant  that  as  a
    solicitor he would not be able to find work in Bangladesh  because  the
    legal fraternity  do  not  understand  the  concept  of  solicitors  in
    Bangladesh. The  Judge  found  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  this
    whatsoever and found that the appellant's parents would be able to find
    work and look after their children in Bangladesh.



21. The children's best interests are served with being provided  with  all
    the requirements for their growth, security, education and to  be  able
    to reach their full potential. There was no evidence before  the  Judge
    that the  qualified  child  would  not  be  able  to  achieve  this  in
    Bangladesh with their parents being qualified lawyers. The Judge  found
    that these objectives can be accomplished  because  their  parents  are
    professional lawyers who will be able to earn  and  provide  for  their
    children.



22. The Judge further considered that forced the parents of  the  qualified
    child have family in Bangladesh and against  that  he  considered  that
    they have no family in the United Kingdom. The  Judge  considered  that
    qualifying child had been brought up in the Bangladesh community in the
    United Kingdom and would be able to adjust especially  given  that  her
    parents are qualified professionals. There was no  perversity  in  this
    reasoning of the Judge.


23. The Judge did consider that the appellants have been a  burden  on  the
    public purse because they received free treatment on the NHS. I do  not
    accept that this was taken against the qualifying  child  or  her  best
    interests. The decision would inevitably have  been  the  same  on  the
    facts of this appeal. I say this because it was  not  material  to  the
    issue that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had to decide. The  issue  for
    decision was whether requiring the appellant and his family's return to
    Bangladesh would be in breach of the immigration rules or Article 8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights.


24. The First-tier Tribunal  was  entitled  to  find  that  all  the  first
    appellant and his family can return to Bangladesh  and  continue  their
    family and private life in that country of which they are citizens.


25. It was alleged that the Judge confused the test in section 276 ADE  and
    117B.  The test both under 276 ADE of the immigration  rules  and  117B
    are the same and the same enquiries have to be made. This is whether it
    would be reasonable for the child to return to  the  country  of  their
    nationality  with  their  parents   taking   into   account   all   her
    circumstances. By virtue of section 117D a "qualifying child"  means  a
    person who is under the age of 18 and who- (a) is a British citizen, or
    (b) has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period  of  seven
    years or more.  If a child is a qualifying child for  the  purposes  of
    section 117B of the 2002 Act as amended, the issue  will  generally  be
    whether it is not reasonable for that child to return.


26. Although R (on the application of Osanwemwenze) v SSHD 2014  EWHC  1563
    was not specifically concerned with section 117B it has some  relevance
    in terms of the reasonableness of a child leaving the UK. In this case,
    the claimant's 14-year-old stepson from Nigeria had been in the  United
    Kingdom for more than 7 years and had leave to remain in his own right.
    It  was  held  that  this  was  an  important  but  not  an  overriding
    consideration and it was reasonable to  expect  the  claimant's  family
    including  the  stepson  to  relocate  to  Nigeria.  The  parents   had
    experienced life there into adulthood and would be able to provide  for
    the children and help them to reintegrate.


27. In AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) the Tribunal held that when
    the question posed by s117B(6) is the same question posed  in  relation
    to children by paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv), it must be posed  and  answered
    in the proper context of whether it was reasonable to expect the  child
    to follow its parents to their country of origin; EV (Philippines).  It
    is not however a question that  needs  to  be  posed  and  answered  in
    relation to each child more than once.


28. In R (on the application of MA (Pakistan) and Others) v Upper  Tribunal
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) and Another [2016] EWCA Civ 705 it was
    held that when considering whether it was reasonable to remove a  child
    from the UK under rule  276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  a
    court or tribunal should not simply focus on the child but should  have
    regard to the  wider  public  interest  considerations,  including  the
    conduct and immigration history of the parents. It was  also  confirmed
    however that if section 117B(6) applies then "there  can  be  no  doubt
    that section 117B(6) must be read as a self-contained provision in  the
    sense  that  Parliament  has  stipulated  that  where  the   conditions
    specified in the sub-section are satisfied, the  public  interest  will
    not justify removal." It was additionally held, however, that the  fact
    that a child had been in  the  UK  for  seven  years  should  be  given
    significant weight in  the  proportionality  exercise  because  of  its
    relevant to determining the nature and strength  of  the  child's  best
    interests and as it established as a starting point that  leave  should
    be granted unless there were powerful  reasons  to  the  contrary.  The
    Court of Session has approved and followed the  approach  taken  in  MA
    (Pakistan) in the case of SA, SI, SI and TA v SSHD [2017] CSOH 117.


29. In the recent case of MT and ET (child's  best  interests;  ex  tempore
    pilot) Nigeria [2018] UKUT 00088 it was held that a very  young  child,
    who had not started school or who has only recently done so, will  have
    difficulty in establishing that her Article 8 private and  family  life
    has a material element, which lies outside her need to  live  with  her
    parent or parents, wherever  that  may  be.   This  position,  however,
    changes over time, with the result that an assessment of best interests
    must  adopt  a  correspondingly  wider  focus,  examining  the  child's
    position in the wider  world,  of  which  school  will  usually  be  an
    important part.  On the particular facts of a child who had been in the
    UK for ten years from the age of 4, that  her  mother  had  abused  the
    immigration laws by overstaying on a visit visa and then making a false
    asylum claim and at  some  stage  using  a  false  document  to  obtain
    employment was not such a bad immigration history as to constitute  the
    kind of "powerful" reason that would  render  the  child's  removal  to
    Nigeria reasonable.


30. The Judge took into account all the factors including the fact that the
    child's life from the ages of 4 to 11 are  more  significant  than  the
    first four years of her life.  The qualifying child being at the age of
    eight, is not at a pivotal stage of her education and can adapt to life
    and the education system in Bangladesh. The Judge referred to the  case
    of Azmi Moyed and others [2013] UKUT it was stated that the  children's
    connections the United Kingdom become more important from ages of 4  to
    11. The qualifying child was eight years old and therefore her ties  to
    this country were still tenuous. There is no material error of  law  in
    the Judge's findings on the evidence.



31. The First-tier Tribunal Judge understood the evidence  and  found  that
    the best interests of the qualifying child must  inform  his  decision.
    There is no perversity in the findings made that the appellant and  his
    family can return to Bangladesh and they can integrate into the culture
    and lifestyle of Bangladesh.


32. Having considered the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, in the
    round, I am of the view that the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not fall
    into material error both in fact or in law. The appellants appeal is no
    more than a quarrel with the First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings which
    he was entitled to make on the evidence. I find  that  the  differently
    constituted Tribunal would not come to  a  different  decision  on  the
    facts of this case.


33. The upshot is that the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  not
    affected by a material error and I find that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    did conduct  a  proper  assessment  of  all  the  appellants'  and  the
    qualifying child's rights pursuant to the Immigration Rules and Article
    8. I uphold the decision dismissing the appellant's appeal.


Conclusions

34. I therefore find that the appellants appeals must fail pursuant to  the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights.
