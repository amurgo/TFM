                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is  a  remade  decision  following  the  identification  of  a
         material error of law in the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Eldridge (the FtJ), promulgated on 13 April 2017, allowing
         the appellant's appeal against the  respondent'  refusal,  dated  4
         March 2016, of his human rights claim.

      2. The error of law in the First-tier Tribunal decision was identified
         in a decision of the Upper Tribunal  issued  on  12  July  2017.  A
         resumed hearing on 1 September 2017 was  adjourned  to  enable  the
         respondent to obtain information from HMRC relating to the economic
         activity of the appellant's ex-partner. This information was served
         by the respondent on the appellant's representatives and the  Upper
         Tribunal in an email sent on 16 November 2017.

    Background

      3. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, date of birth 15 June 1965.
         He entered the UK on the 10  January  2000  from  the  Republic  of
         Ireland. The respondent's decision of 4 February 2016 states  that,
         on the 31 July 2010, the appellant applied for 'leave to remain' as
         a partner of an EEA national and that  he  was  granted  'leave  to
         remain' valid from 30 November 2010 to 30  November  2015.  If  the
         appellant was the family member or partner of an EEA  national  the
         immigration rules would not have applied to him. In the absence  of
         any clear evidence to the contrary we regard the reference  to  the
         grant of 'leave to remain' to mean that the appellant was issued an
         EEA residence card.

      4. On 5 November 2015 the appellant applied for leave to remain on the
         basis of his relationship with Mrs Nanna Grace Johnson, a  Nigerian
         national present in the UK with Indefinite Leave to  Remain  (ILR).
         The respondent was not satisfied that the appellant and Mrs Johnson
         were in a genuine and subsisting relationship. The respondent noted
         that  the  appellant  had  provided  a  Learning  Resource  Network
         certificate  to  show  that  he  had  completed  an   Entry   Level
         certificate in ESOL Skills for life (Speaking and Listening)  level
         3. The certificate was not however included in Appendix  O  of  the
         immigration rules and was  not  included  in  the  Common  European
         Framework of  Reference  for  Languages  (CEFRL)  with  a  provider
         approved by the Secretary of State. The appellant therefore  failed
         to meet the relevant English language requirement.  The  respondent
         did not go on to make  any  specific  finding  as  to  whether  the
         appellant met the financial requirements under the five-year  route
         to settlement contained in Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE.

      5. The respondent proceeded to consider whether the appellant met  the
         requirements for a grant  of  leave  under  the  10-year  route  in
         Appendix-FM. Having found that the appellant and Mrs  Johnson  were
         not in a genuine relationship the respondent concluded that EX.1 of
         Appendix-FM did not apply. The respondent then  considered  whether
         the appellant  met  the  requirements  of  leave  to  remain  under
         paragraph 276ADE of the immigration rules but concluded that he did
         not. Finally, the respondent  considered  whether  there  were  any
         exceptional  circumstances  outside  of  the   immigration   rules,
         consistent with the right to respect for family life  contained  in
         article 8 ECHR, that might warrant  a  grant  of  leave  to  remain
         outside of the immigration rules. The application did  not  however
         raise any such exceptional circumstances.



The First-tier Tribunal decision

      6. At the First-tier Tribunal hearing the  appellant  served  a  large
         bundle of documents including financial  evidence.  The  FtJ  heard
         evidence from both the appellant and his wife  and  the  Presenting
         Officer accepted that the relationship between  the  appellant  and
         Mrs Johnson was genuine and subsisting. The FtJ found,  and  it  is
         not in dispute, that the appellant had not  provided  the  specific
         evidence to meet the English  language  test  as  required  in  the
         immigration rules. The appellant needed to show that he had  passed
         an English language test to Level A1 of the CEFRL with an  approved
         provider or that he had obtained a relevant academic qualification.
         He could not meet  either  of  these  requirements  and  could  not
         therefore succeed under the five-year route under Appendix FM.

      7. The FtJ proceeded to consider whether the appellant could meet  the
         requirements under Appendix-FM for a grant of leave to remain under
         the 10-year route. To do so the appellant  was  required  to  show,
         pursuant  to  EX.1  and  EX.2  of  Appendix  FM,  that  there  were
         "insurmountable obstacles"  preventing  him  and  Ms  Johnson  from
         continuing their family life outside the UK.

      8. In assessing the existence of  insurmountable  obstacles,  the  FtJ
         made the following factual findings. The relationship  between  the
         appellant and Mrs Johnson began in November 2012, they began living
         together in February 2013, and were married on  4  September  2015.
         The appellant's previous marriage had  broken  down  by  2012.  The
         appellant and Mrs Johnson had no formal  tenancy  agreement  (their
         tenure was wholly informal). They  paid  rent  totalling  �620  per
         month. Before the appellant came to the UK he lived  in  Lagos,  in
         rented accommodation, and sold second-hand cars. He visited Nigeria
         in 2013 following the death of his sister. Mrs Johnson came to  the
         UK in 1988 from Nigeria where she had been living in Lagos with her
         parents. When she entered the UK, she was about 25 years  old.  She
         had travelled to Nigeria both in 2013 and  2015  to  attend  family
         matters.  She  was  in   full-time   regular   employment   earning
         approximately �23,000  gross  per  year.  The  appellant  had  some
         difficulties  with  his  eyesight  in  his  right   eye.   He   was
         nevertheless able to work and wished to work if permitted to do so.
         He had friends in Nigeria but had no close relations living  there;
         nor did his wife. He  had  recently  worked  and  the  couple  were
         earning between �35,000 and �40,000 per annum.

      9. The FtJ was satisfied, because of his wife's employment,  that  the
         appellant met the financial requirements of the rules. The FtJ  did
         not however undertake any detailed evaluation to determine  whether
         the financial and evidential requirements of both Appendix  FM  and
         Appendix FM-SE were met as of the date of the application for leave
         to remain, or as of the date of the appeal hearing.

     10. The FtJ noted that the appellant had lived in the UK for  17  years
         and that he gave his evidence in  fluent  English.  The  FtJ  found
         there was no reason to suppose that the appellant would  be  unable
         to obtain  the  basic  low-level  English  language  qualifications
         required by the immigration rules. The FtJ was satisfied that there
         was every prospect that the appellant  would  be  able  to  make  a
         successful application for entry clearance as a spouse,  and  there
         was no reason, from a practical point of view, why his  wife  would
         need to leave either her work (she worked as a nurse in the NHS) or
         accommodation in the UK. On the other hand, the FtJ  observed  that
         the appellant could not meet the requirements  of  the  immigration
         rules  unless  it  was  shown  that  there   were   'insurmountable
         obstacles' to the couple enjoying family life outside the UK.

     11. The FtJ  noted  that  there  were  no  very  significant  obstacles
         preventing the appellant's integration in Nigeria.  The  FtJ  noted
         that Ms Johnson was a Nigerian national  who  had  visited  Nigeria
         twice within the last 3 or 4 years, and was married to  a  Nigerian
         national. There was nothing to indicate that  she  did  not  retain
         good knowledge of the languages and cultures of that  country.  The
         FtJ  concluded  that,  although   there   would   be   considerable
         difficulties were she to return to Nigeria in order to continue her
         relationship  with  her  husband,  there  were  no  'insurmountable
         obstacles' as understood in EX.1, with reference to EX.2.

     12. The FtJ then considered the appeal outside the immigration rules on
         article 8 grounds. He took account of the factors in s.117B of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, noting in  particular
         that the relationship was forged while the appellant was in the  UK
         lawfully. The FtJ then considered whether it was  proportionate  to
         require the appellant to leave the UK and make an  entry  clearance
         application from Nigeria. The FtJ set  out  an  extract  from  Lord
         Reid's judgment in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 indicating, with  respect
         to individuals who were not foreign criminals, that  even  if  they
         were residing unlawfully, if they  were  otherwise  certain  to  be
         granted leave to enter in respect of an application  made  overseas
         there 'might' be no public interest in  their  removal.  The  judge
         considered that the present appeal was a Chikwamba [2008]  UKHL  40
         type situation and that the normally very strong public interest in
         removal was outweighed given the nature of  the  relationship,  the
         firm roots established by the appellant and his wife, and the 'most
         realistic prospect' of a successful application  from  abroad.  The
         appeal was allowed on the basis that the decision breached  section
         6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

The 'error of law' decision

     13. In the 'error of law' decision promulgated  on  12  July  2017  the
         Upper Tribunal was satisfied that the FtJ was entitled  to  form  a
         view as to the appellant's proficiency in English  and  that  there
         was nothing in the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  capable
         of undermining  the  FtJ's  conclusion  that  the  appellant  spoke
         English  fluently.  The  Upper  Tribunal  noted  however  that  the
         appellant did not have the mandatory English language qualification
         when he made his application for leave to remain, and  he  did  not
         have the requisite qualification even at  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         hearing. Unlike the situation in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40,  it  had
         not  been  accepted  by  the  Secretary  of  State  that  all   the
         requirements for entry clearance as a spouse had been met bar  that
         relating to appellant's presence inside the UK and his need to make
         an entry clearance application as a partner. A  mandatory  document
         necessary for a grant of entry clearance  remained  missing.  While
         the appellant may  well  be  capable  of  obtaining  the  requisite
         English Language Certificate he did not have the required  evidence
         in  the  required  form.  There  was  therefore  some   degree   of
         speculation  as  to  whether  the  appropriate   English   language
         certificate would be provided, as opposed to the certainty referred
         to in the extract from Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11.

     14. The Upper Tribunal was additionally concerned that, in her decision
         letter, the respondent gave no formal consideration to whether  the
         appellant met the financial and  evidential  requirements  of  both
         Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE. In these circumstances,  the  Upper
         Tribunal did not consider that the  respondent's  silence  on  this
         point could be considered as synonymous with an acceptance  by  her
         that an application for entry clearance would succeed based on  the
         financial and evidential requirements  of  the  immigration  rules.
         There was no indication in the FtJ's  decision  that  any  detailed
         consideration had been given  to  the  evidential  requirements  of
         Appendix FM-SE, and no indication that the respondent, through  her
         Presenting Officer, ever formally conceded that the  financial  and
         evidential requirements had been met. In purporting  to  apply  the
         Chikwamba principal the FtJ should have considered whether all  the
         financial and evidential requirements for entry clearance were met,
         or confirmed with the respondent that she considered that they were
         met.

     15. Even if  the  FtJ  was  satisfied  that  all  of  the  requirements
         necessary for a notional grant of entry clearance were met  it  was
         still incumbent on him to consider whether the requirement to  make
         the appellant  return  to  Nigeria  and  make  an  entry  clearance
         application would have caused significant interference with his and
         his partner's family life by reason of the temporary removal (see R
         (on the application of Chen) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary  separation  -
         proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC), at  [39].  There  was
         however little assessment, other than by reference to the nature of
         the relationship and the firm roots established  by  the  appellant
         and his partner, as to why a temporary  separation  would  cause  a
         breach of article 8 in respect of their relationship. There were no
         children involved, no evidence that Mrs Johnson suffered  from  any
         particular physical or mental health  ailments,  no  evidence  that
         they  could  not  remain  in  contact  whilst  an  entry  clearance
         application was being made, and no evidence as to how long such  an
         entry clearance application would normally take. The Upper Tribunal
         was consequently satisfied that the FtJ materially erred in law.

     16. The matter was adjourned to enable the parties to  provide  further
         evidence, to be served no later than 7 days prior to the  adjourned
         hearing, relating to whether the appellant did meet the  evidential
         and financial requirements of Appendix FM and Appendix  FM-SE,  the
         length of time that an entry clearance  application  is  likely  to
         take, and any other relevant evidence relating  to  nature  of  any
         interference with family life caused by a temporary separation.

The resumed hearing

     17. In additional to the bundle of documents prepared  for  the  First-
         tier Tribunal hearing, a further bundle of documents was served  by
         the appellant's representatives containing, inter alia, wage  slips
         relating to Mrs Johnson's employment from April to  December  2015,
         her bank account statements from March to December 2015,  her  P60s
         for the tax years ending April 2015, April 2016 and April 2017  (in
         respect  of  Pulse  Healthcare  Ltd),  a  CEFR  Level   A1   'Entry
         Examination in Spoken English, issued on  21  August  2017,  and  a
         statement from the appellant dated 30 August 2017. At  the  hearing
         Mr Mustafa provided a copy of a further P60 for the tax year ending
         April 2017 relating to  Mrs  Johnson's  employment  with  'Imperial
         College Healthcare Trust, a partial photocopy of the appellant's ex-
         partner's P45 relating to employment in 2006, and some further wage
         slips relating to Ms Johnson's employment going up to July 2017. In
         addition to the two page HMRC document served on 16 November  2017,
         Mr Jarvis provided a skeleton argument.

     18. We ascertained from Mr Mustafa that no  evidence  of  Ms  Johnson's
         wage slips or bank account statements covering the  6-month  period
         up to the date of the resumed hearing had been provided. Mr Mustafa
         sought an adjournment to provide  this  evidence.  We  declined  to
         grant the  adjournment.  The  appellant  was  on  notice  from  the
         directions issued by the Upper Tribunal on 12 July  2017  that  any
         further evidence upon which he wished to  rely  would  need  to  be
         provided no later than 7 days prior to  the  resumed  hearing.  The
         appellant was aware that the question whether he  could  notionally
         meet the requirements of a grant of entry clearance was  in  issue,
         and that the relevant date was the date of the resumed hearing.  Mr
         Mustafa  accepted  that  the  further  evidence  should  have  been
         provided and that there was no good explanation for the failure  to
         provide this evidence. In refusing the adjournment  we  noted  that
         the application was not made until the hearing, despite the history
         of the appeal. We additionally noted the absence of any letter from
         Mrs Johnson's employer confirming the  details  of  her  employment
         (Appendix FM-SE (2)(b)). We considered  the  overriding  principles
         enunciated in rule 2 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
         Rules 2008, and the principles identified in Nwaigwe  (adjournment:
         fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC), and satisfied ourselves that the
         refusal of the adjournment did not deprive the appellant of a  fair
         hearing.

     19. We heard submissions  from  Mr  Mustafa  in  respect  of  the  HMRC
         document. He submitted that the  partner  was  never  a  burden  on
         public funds and that this distinguished the  appeal  from  Lawrie-
         Blum v Land Baden-Wurttemberg, Case 66/85 [1986] ECR 2121.  In  the
         alternative, he submitted that the HMRC document indicated that the
         ex-partner's employment history had not been fully disclosed.  With
         respect  to  article  8,  Mr  Mustafa  submitted   that   paragraph
         276ADE(vi)  was  at  variance  with  s.117B  and  that  the   'very
         significant obstacles' in paragraph 276ADE was more apt to apply to
         foreign criminals by reference to s.117C(4)(c). The fact  that  the
         appellant now had an English language certificate was also relevant
         to  the  proportionality  assessment.  We  were  referred  to   Mrs
         Johnson's combined income of over �60,000, and to  the  appellant's
         statement dated 30 August 2017.

     20. Mr Jarvis adopted his skeleton argument and noted  the  absence  of
         any challenge before the hearing to the HMRC document. He submitted
         it  was  an  accurate  rendering  of  the  ex-partner's  employment
         records. The appellant did not come anywhere close to demonstrating
         that he met the requirements of the immigration rules for  a  grant
         of entry clearance. Any challenge to the vires of  the  immigration
         rules should normally be commenced in the High Court, and,  in  any
         event, there was no clash between s.117B and  paragraph  276ADE(vi)
         as the former was looking at the  private  life  established  by  a
         person in the UK while the matter was directed to the private  life
         established by a person outside the UK.

    Discussion

     21. The resumed hearing listed for 1 September 2017 was adjourned as an
         issue arose on the day whether the appellant may have  a  permanent
         right of residence in the UK through his relationship with his  ex-
         partner. In order to determine this issue an 'Amos'  direction  was
         issued, pursuant to Amos & Anor v Secretary of State for  the  Home
         Department [2011] EWCA Civ 552, requiring the respondent to contact
         HMRC to obtain from their records any information relating  to  the
         employment of the appellant's former spouse covering the period  01
         January 2003 to 12 May 2015.

     22. The respondent provided a witness  statement  from  an  Officer  of
         HMRC, dated 23 October 2017, outlining how she  examined  the  HMRC
         computer records as specified in the  respondent's  request,  which
         included the name of the appellant's ex-partner [AK] (previous name
         [AO]), her date of birth, and her  NIN  ([-]).  This  NIN  was  not
         linked to the ex-partner on the HMRC records, and another  NIN  was
         given for her. The document indicated that no HMRC  Self-Assessment
         Tax records were held for the ex-partner, and that  there  were  no
         PAYE Employment records for her in the tax years 2015  -  2016  and
         2017 - 2018. The document set out the ex-partner's gross pay/income
         for the various tax years  from  2011-2012  to  2014-2015.  In  the
         absence of a Government Issued NIN it was  not  possible  to  trace
         employment history for the period 01 January 2003 to 05 April 2011.



     23. Given that the appellant was issued with a  residence  card  on  30
         November 2010 as the  family  member  of  a  qualified  person,  as
         defined in the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
         2006, there must have been sufficient evidence that,  at  the  date
         the residence card was issued, his ex-partner was exercising Treaty
         rights. There is however no evidence as to how long the appellant's
         ex-partner was exercising Treaty rights prior to the grant  of  the
         residence card. The HMRC evidence states that the NIN  provided  by
         the appellant and relating to the ex-partner did not link with  the
         information contained on the HMRC systems. As a result,  there  was
         no employment history for the ex-partner from 01 January 2003 to  4
         April 2011.

     24. The HMRC evidence suggests that the ex-partner was  not  exercising
         Treaty rights in the tax years 2011 to 2012, and 2012  to  2013  as
         her total income was on such a small scale as  to  be  regarded  as
         purely marginal (her total income in the tax year 2011 to 2012  was
         �1,010.64, and her total income in the tax year 2012  to  2013  was
         �870.14). On the principles established in Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-
         Wurttemberg, Case 66/85 [1986] ECR 2121, we find that the appellant
         has not demonstrated that  his  ex-partner  was  exercising  treaty
         rights from the end of the tax year 2011 to the end of the tax year
         2014. There is no evidence that the appellant was the family member
         of a qualified person for a continuous period of 5 years. He cannot
         therefore establish that he  has  attained  a  right  of  permanent
         residence through his relationship with his ex-partner.

     25. Nor is it apparent from the HMRC evidence that the appellant's  ex-
         partner was  residing  in  the  UK  in  accordance  with  the  2006
         Regulations at the date of the termination of the marriage (12  May
         2015). The HMRC evidence indicates that the appellant's  ex-partner
         received an income of �1,850 in the tax year 2014 to  2015).  Based
         on Lawrie-Blum, this amount is too small to  amount  to  meaningful
         employment. In any event, the evidence only goes up to the  end  of
         the 2015 tax year, which  is  5  April  2015.  There  are  no  PAYE
         Employment records held for the appellant's  ex-wife  for  the  tax
         year 2015 to 2016, or indeed for 2017 to 2018. There  is  therefore
         no evidence that the ex-partner was a qualified person  on  12  May
         2015 as required by the 2006 Regulations  in  respect  of  retained
         rights of residence.

     26. Mr Mustafa submitted that, as the NIN number provided to  HMRC  was
         not linked to the ex-partner, her employment history had  not  been
         fully disclosed. The appellant's solicitors did not  however  raise
         any issue in respect of  the  reliability  of  the  HMRC  evidence,
         despite being in receipt of the evidence since  16  November  2017,
         and no application was made  to  obtain  further  clarification  in
         respect of the ex-partner's NIN, or to serve a witness summons  for
         the ex-partner. While Mr Mustafa provided a  partial  photocopy  of
         what is said to be the ex-partner's  P45,  relating  to  employment
         that she left in October 2006, the right-hand side of the  document
         was missing, including the issue date. Given that the P45  document
         is only a partial photocopy, and in the absence of  any  suggestion
         that HMRC records are in any way inaccurate, we find we can  attach
         little weight to the P45 as it is not a reliable document.

     27.  Mr  Mustafa  submitted  that  the  'very  significant   obstacles'
         threshold  in   paragraph   276ADE(vi)   is   equivalent   to   the
         proportionality threshold in respect  of  foreign  criminals  under
         s.117C of the 2002  Act,  and  that  there  is  an  'inconsistency'
         between primary legislation and the immigration rules.  We  profess
         to having some difficulty in following his argument. He appeared to
         be contending that the immigration rules were ultra vires so far as
         they related to paragraph 276ADE(vi).  We  have  no  hesitation  in
         rejecting this argument. Although paragraph 276ADE is an attempt to
         incorporate article 8 considerations within the immigration  rules,
         the rules remain a statement by the Secretary of State of  how  she
         will exercise powers of control over immigration. In Ahmed Mahad  v
         ECO [2009] UKSC 16 the Supreme Court stated, at paragraph [10]:

             "There is really no dispute about the proper approach  to  the
             construction of the Rules. As Lord Hoffman said in  Odelola  v
             Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] 1 WLR  1230,
             1233 (paragraph 4):

                  'Further, like any other question  of  construction,  this
                  [whether  a  Rule  change  applies  to  all   undetermined
                  applications or only to subsequent  applications]  depends
                  upon the language  of  the  Rule,  construed  against  the
                  relevant background. That involves a consideration of  the
                  Immigration Rules as a whole and the function  which  they
                  serve in the administration of immigration policy.'"

     28. And in AM (Ethiopia) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 1082 Laws  LJ  at  [38]
         stated:

             "The whole of [the Immigration Rules] meaning is, so to speak,
             worn on their sleeve."

     29. We find there  is  no  inconsistency  between  the  requirement  in
         paragraph  276ADE(vi)  that  there  must   be   'very   significant
         obstacles' to an applicant's integration in their home country, and
         a similar requirement in s.117C(4)(c). The latter is only one of  3
         threshold requirements under s.117C(4)  in  respect  of  a  foreign
         criminal, the other two being lawful residence in the UK  for  most
         of that person's life, and their need to be socially and culturally
         integrated.   The  overlap  of  one  requirement  does  not  render
         paragraph 276ADE ultra vires.

     30. The appellant  maintains  that  it  would  be  disproportionate  to
         require him to  return  to  Nigeria  to  make  an  entry  clearance
         application as he meets the  principles  established  in  Chikwamba
         [2008] UKHL 40. For the appellant  to  succeed  in  his  appeal  in
         reliance on Chikwamba he would need to show  that,  in  a  notional
         entry clearance application, considered at the date of the hearing,
         he would be bound to be granted entry clearance. In Agyarko  [2017]
         UKSC 11 Lord Reed stated, at [51],

             "Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or is entitled
             to  remain  in  the  UK   only   temporarily,   however,   the
             significance of this consideration depends on what the outcome
             of immigration control might otherwise be. For example, if  an
             applicant would  otherwise  be  automatically  deported  as  a
             foreign criminal, then the weight of the  public  interest  in
             his or her removal will generally be very considerable. If, on
             the other hand,  an  applicant-even  if  residing  in  the  UK
             unlawfully-was otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter,
             at least if an application were made from outside the UK, then
             there might be no public interest in his or her  removal.  The
             point is illustrated by the decision in Chikwamba v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department."

     31. It is clear that there must be certainty that  an  entry  clearance
         application  would  be  granted.  Appendix  FM-SE  sets   out   the
         evidential requirements that must be  met  in  an  entry  clearance
         application as a spouse. The evidential requirements in Appendix FM-
         SE are as important as those in Appendix FM (SSHD v  SS  (Congo)  &
         Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387).

     32. In a statutory  appeal,  the  date  of  the  hearing  is  the  most
         appropriate chronological fixed point to determine whether a future
         entry clearance application would succeed as it  is  likely  to  be
         closest to the actual date of a future entry clearance application,
         and any other date (such as the date of an application for leave to
         remain) would only indicate whether,  as  a  historical  fact,  the
         appellant met the requirements.

     33. Adapting the requirements of Appendix FM-SE,  the  appellant  would
         need to provide his partner's payslips and bank account  statements
         covering a period of 6 months prior to the  date  of  the  hearing.
         These requirements are not met. While  payslips  and  bank  account
         statements covering a 6 months period in 2015 have  been  provided,
         and some further wage slips up to July 2017, the specified evidence
         relating to wage slips and bank account details is absent. While we
         accept that Mrs Johnson is likely to still be employed, and earning
         in excess of the minimum financial requirement in  Appendix-FM,  we
         are unable to conclude that the requirements of Appendix FM-SE  are
         met.

     34. In any event, the appellant has not  produced  a  letter  from  Mrs
         Johnson's employer  confirming  her  employment  and  gross  annual
         salary, the length of her employment, the period over which she has
         been paid the level of salary  relied  on  in  the  notional  entry
         clearance application, and her type of employment, as  required  by
         Appendix FM-SE(2)(b). The omission of this letter would alone,  and
         quite independently of the absence of  the  relevant  payslips  and
         bank account statements, prevent the  appellant  from  meeting  the
         entry clearance requirements.

     35. We therefore conclude that the appellant cannot  avail  himself  of
         the Chikwamba principles as there is no certainty, in  the  absence
         of  the  specified  evidence,  that  he  would  be  granted   entry
         clearance.

     36. The FtJ concluded that there would be no  insurmountable  obstacles
         to Mrs Johnson relocating to  Nigeria  in  order  to  maintain  her
         family life relationship (see paragraph 11 of this  judgment).  The
         appellant  did  not  challenge  this  aspect  of   the   First-tier
         Tribunal's decision. We are, in any event, independently  satisfied
         that there would be no insurmountable obstacles, as  understood  in
         EX.1 and EX.2 of Appendix-FM. In arriving at  this  conclusion,  we
         note that, although Mrs Johnson has lived in the UK since 1988 (she
         entered the UK aged  about  25),  and  that  she  is  in  permanent
         employment, she retains her Nigerian  nationality,  she  spent  the
         formative years of her life in Nigeria and has recently visited the
         country,  she  would  have  the   support   of   her   husband   in
         reintegrating, and is in  good  health.  The  appellant  previously
         worked selling cars and there is no reason  why  he  and  his  wife
         could not seek employment.

     37.   We   have   additionally   considered   whether   it   would   be
         disproportionate  under   article   8,   considered   outside   the
         immigration rules, to either require the  appellant  to  return  to
         Nigeria and make an entry clearance application. We take account of
         the factors in s.117B of the 2002 Act and note that  the  appellant
         does speak English and that he  is  capable  of  being  financially
         independent, and that the relationship appears to have been entered
         into when he was lawfully present, and that he is  likely  to  meet
         the financial requirements of the immigration  rules.  We  are  not
         however satisfied that the consequences of disruption to the family
         life enjoyed by the appellant and his wife, by what is likely to be
         only a short and temporary separation, are sufficient to render his
         removal disproportionate.  In  reaching  this  conclusion  we  have
         considered the statement from the appellant dated  30  August  2017
         and the 'Visa application  Processing  Times'  download  indicating
         that 92% of settlement applications are decided within 60 days, and
         100% decided within 90 days. While the appellant  claims  that  his
         wife would be financially unable to support him in Nigeria while he
         makes an entry clearance  application  and  herself,  her  combined
         income of over �60,000 belies  this  claim.  The  medical  evidence
         provided by the appellant relating to his eye does not suggest that
         a temporary separation would adversely  affect  his  eyesight,  and
         there is no  evidence  that  he  would  be  unable  to  obtain  the
         necessary treatment or medication in  Nigeria.  Nor  is  there  any
         independent medical or other evidence indicating that the impact of
         a temporary separation would have a significant adverse  impact  on
         the mental health or emotional wellbeing of either the appellant or
         Mrs Johnson.

     38. We conclude, for  the  reasons  given,  that  the  refusal  of  the
         appellant's   human   rights   claim   does   not   constitute    a
         disproportionate  interference  with  article  8  and  dismiss  the
         appeal.
