Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Ryngasamy, Lawrence Associates, Solicitors,
London
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are citizens of Cameroon born on 15th  June  1979,  28th
    December 1960, 23rd May 1981, 16th February 1989 and 22nd February 1985
    respectively.  They appealed against decisions of the Respondent  dated
    29th March 2014 refusing the First Appellant permanent residence in the
    United Kingdom on the basis that he is the  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national and has resided in the United Kingdom with that  EEA  national
    in accordance  with  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  for  a
    continuous period of five years and refusing the other four Appellants'
    applications for residence cards as a confirmation of a right to reside
    in the United Kingdom as dependent family members of  an  EEA  national
    who is exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom as a worker.  The
    appeals were heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Baldwin on  21st
    November 2014.  He dismissed the appeals under the Immigration Rules in
    a decision promulgated on 28th November 2014.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged  and  permission  to
    appeal was refused by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Foudy  on  3rd
    February 2015.  An application for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was lodged and permission was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Frances on 3rd June 2015.  The permission refers to the  grounds  which
    argue that the judge erred in law in finding that comprehensive medical
    insurance was required, given that  the  EEA  national  was  exercising
    treaty rights as a worker.  They go on to state that the  judge  failed
    to take into account the  fact  that  the  First  Appellant's  son  had
    acquired British citizenship so    accordingly  the  First  Appellant's
    spouse was entitled to permanent residence and the First Appellant  was
    entitled to the same.  The permission states  that  neither  the  First
    Appellant's  spouse  nor  his  mother  attended  the  hearing  and  the
    Appellant's bundle was served on the day of  the  hearing.   The  judge
    found that the Second to Fifth Appellants had failed to show that  they
    are dependent on the First Appellant.  The  permission  refers  to  the
    judge not accepting the First Appellant's evidence that his wife was  a
    qualified person under the Regulations or that his mother  and  brother
    were dependent on her.  The permission states that the  judge  properly
    directed himself in relation to dependency under Regulation 8 but it is
    arguable that he failed to  properly  direct  himself  in  relation  to
    Regulation 15 and failed to consider the evidence that the  Appellant's
    son had obtained British citizenship and these are arguable  errors  of
    law.

 3. There is no Rule 24 response.

 4. The Appellants' representative submitted that there was evidence before
    the First-tier Tribunal at pages 8 to  13  of  the  Appellants'  bundle
    showing that the First Appellant's Polish wife, the EEA  national,  had
    been exercising treaty rights for more than five  years  as  a  worker.
    The representative submitted that the First Appellant's  appeal  should
    therefore have been allowed.  He  submitted  that  in  2012  a  British
    passport was issued to the child of the First Appellant and the  Polish
    national and that the Home Office Guidance states that if a child of an
    EEA national is registered  as  British  the  EEA  national  should  be
    granted indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

 5. The representative then referred to the dependency of the other  family
    members.  He submitted that the judge failed to properly direct himself
    in relation to Regulation 15 and failed to consider the  evidence  that
    the First Appellant's son had obtained British citizenship.

 6. I  was  referred  to  paragraph  15  of  the  decision  and  the  First
    Appellant's credibility.  He submitted that  the  whole  assessment  of
    credibility has been made on a false premise.   The  First  Appellant's
    previous asylum claim raises the issue of  credibility.   He  submitted
    that all the evidence has to be considered when credibility is assessed
    and the First-tier Judge did not do this.  He submitted that  the  case
    of Lim [2013] UKUT 00437 has to be given weight and the judge was wrong
    to question the reasons behind the dependency by stating  that  one  is
    entitled to look for a good explanation as to why the  First  Appellant
    should have sent so much money.  He submitted  that  the  case  of  Lim
    clearly states that dependency can be of  choice.   He  submitted  that
    paragraph 16 of the decision is in error as the  judge  questioned  the
    funds of the First Appellant and did not take into account that he  has
    his own business, is  working  and  has  shown  that  he  has  �60,000.
    Accounts were produced to substantiate the First Appellant's  financial
    position and his earnings and I was referred to pages 81 to 167 of  the
    Appellants' bundle.  The representative submitted that prior dependency
    has been shown and existing dependency has been shown.

 7. The representative submitted that the judge has referred to the absence
    of the First Appellant's mother, the Second  Appellant,  at  the  First
    Tier Hearing and I was referred to a letter explaining that her  health
    was not good so she was unable to  attend  the  hearing.   I  was  also
    referred  to  the  entries  on  the  First  Appellant's  passport.   He
    submitted that  the  judge  should  have  accepted  that  he  has  been
    travelling and takes money with him.

 8.  The  representative  submitted  that  due  consideration  and  anxious
    scrutiny were not given to the evidence adduced and the appeals  should
    be allowed and the case remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for  a
    de novo hearing.

 9. The Presenting Officer made his  submissions  referring  to  the  First
    Appellant's  British  son  and  the  submission  by   the   Appellant's
    representative, that because there is a British son, the  EEA  national
    should be granted settled status.  He submitted that  we  do  not  know
    what evidence was given to the Nationality Department about  the  First
    Appellant's son.  He was granted British nationality in 2012  but  that
    British nationality can be lost if he is outside the United Kingdom for
    two years  or  more.   He  submitted  that  the  fact  that  the  First
    Appellant's son has British nationality is  not  determinative  on  its
    own.  He submitted that this issue does not mean there is an  error  by
    the First-tier Judge.  He submitted that all this shows is that in 2012
    the  EEA  national  gave  evidence  which  satisfied  the   Nationality
    Department that she had settled status.

10. The Presenting Officer then referred to the dependants in this case.  I
    was referred to the grant of permission and he submitted that the judge
    was entitled to refer to the First Appellant's asylum claim  which  was
    rejected and his credibility questioned.  He submitted that this is the
    starting point for the Judge's decision on  the  First  Appellant.   He
    submitted that the grounds of application  are  merely  a  disagreement
    with the findings of the  judge.   He  submitted  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to come to the decision he did, based on what was  before  him
    and the Appellants are trying to reargue the case.  He  submitted  that
    an error of approach by the judge has to be shown and there is no  such
    error.

11. He submitted that there are issues with the Second, Third,  Fourth  and
    Fifth Appellants.  The judge is sceptical about their dependency and he
    submitted that there is no material error in the judge's decision.

12. I  asked  the  Appellants'  representative  if  the  EEA  national  had
    comprehensive medical insurance when she was studying and he  explained
    that she was also working when she was studying so she  was  exercising
    treaty rights as a worker and comprehensive medical  evidence  was  not
    required.

13. The Presenting Officer referred to the case of Lim and  submitted  that
    the Court of Appeal has disagreed with this case and dependency now has
    to be established.

14. The Presenting Officer  referred  to  paragraph  18  of  the  decision,
    relating to dependency.  This states  that  it  is  possible  that  the
    Appellants' all live in the First Appellant's flat at the moment though
    evidence of his ability to accommodate them  all  is  lacking,  but  he
    finds the evidence about providing separate accommodation in the UK for
    three them over an extended period not proven.  He submitted  that  the
    evidence before the judge was not satisfactory relating  to  dependency
    and there is no error of law in the First-tier Judge's decision.

15. The Appellants'  representative  submitted  that  when  credibility  is
    assessed the  judge  has  dealt  with  this  on  a  false  premise  and
    credibility is not an end to  itself.   He  submitted  that  the  First
    Appellant's asylum appeal is irrelevant.  The First Appellant has  been
    here since 2012 and has not lost his residence.

16. He submitted that the judge was not entitled to  question  the  reasons
    behind the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth  Appellants'  dependency  as
    dependency of choice can exist.

17. With regard to source of funds he submitted that if it is disputed that
    the First Appellant is not earning enough the Appellants' bundle  shows
    evidence of �60,000 belonging to the First Appellant which he  received
    as compensation for a medical claim by him.

18. He submitted that there are material errors in the judge's decision and
    I was asked to overturn the decision promulgated on 28th November 2014.

19. The grounds of application refer to comprehensive medical insurance not
    being required.  Based on the evidence in  the  Appellants'  bundle  it
    appears that that is the case.  While the Polish  EEA  national  was  a
    student she was also working.  This  is  an  error  by  the  First-tier
    Judge.

20. With regard to the First Appellant's child having British citizenship I
    have considered the MNI Guidance and note that  the  child  of  an  EEA
    national who did not become a British citizen at birth may now have  an
    entitlement  to  be  registered  as  a  British  citizen.   There   was
    insufficient evidence before the judge for him to come to a  conclusion
    about this but I accept that there is an error in the judge's  decision
    as he did not consider this.

21. The grounds then go on to refer to the decision  containing  irrational
    findings.  There is  no  error  in  the  judge  considering  the  First
    Appellant's refusal of his asylum claim as the starting point for  this
    decision and credibility is raised in  the  asylum  decision.   I  have
    noted the evidence about the  First  Appellant's  contribution  to  his
    local community and the fact  that  he  is  involved  in  high  profile
    charitable  organisations  but  the  judge  finds  that  the  financial
    situation  of  Mr  Foy,  based  on  what  was  before  him,   was   not
    satisfactory.   He  finds  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to
    corroborate his oral evidence.  The judge has considered  this  on  the
    standard of proof of a balance of probabilities.  The Judge  refers  to
    the Second Appellant, Mrs Bong, the First Appellant's mother, obtaining
    a visit visa and not returning to Cameroon  within  the  terms  of  her
    visa. He finds this to be a credibility issue. He is not satisfied with
    the evidence about the First Appellant supporting the other  Appellants
    and he refers to the lack of evidence from important witnesses and  the
    lack of evidence from  the  Inland  Revenue.   He  finds  the  evidence
    relating to the First Appellant's income to be weak  and  gives  proper
    reasons for this.  I find that the judge directed himself  properly  in
    relation to dependency under Regulation 8 of the EEA  Regulations  2006
    but I find  he  has  not  properly  directed  himself  in  relation  to
    Regulation 15 and the First Appellant's permanent residency.

22. I find therefore that there are material errors of law in  the  judge's
    decision.

Notice of Decision

There are  material  errors  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Judge's  decision
dismissing  these  appeals  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  in  a  decision
promulgated on 28 November 2014 and this decision must be set aside.

No findings of the First-tier Tribunal can stand. Under s.12 (2) (b) (i)  of
the 2007 Act and Practice Statement 7.2 the nature and  extent  of  judicial
fact finding necessary for the decision to be remade  is  such  that  it  is
appropriated to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal. The member(s)  of
the First-tier Tribunal chosen to reconsider the case  are  not  to  include
Judge Baldwin.

Anonymity has been directed.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
