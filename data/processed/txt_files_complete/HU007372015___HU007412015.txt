For the Respondents:   Ms S Akinbolu, instructed by Arlingsworth Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State  I  refer  to  the
    parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellants are husband and wife and  citizens  of  the  USA.   They
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary
    of State dated 2nd June 2015 to refuse their application for  leave  to
    remain in the UK on human rights grounds.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Moran allowed the appeals and the Secretary of State now  appeals  with
    permission to this Tribunal.

 3. The background to this appeal is that the first Appellant was  born  in
    Egypt and the second was born in Sudan, they  met  in  Egypt  in  1966.
    They married in 1967 and emigrated to the USA where the first Appellant
    worked as an architect, he retired in 2003. The couple have no children
    and had no other relatives in the USA.  They decided to move to the  UK
    in order to be close to their family including the  second  Appellant's
    brother and his wife. The Appellants came to the UK in April 2005  with
    visitor visas valid for a period of six months.  During the  course  of
    the six months they made applications for leave to  remain  which  were
    refused.  The reasons for refusal letter sets out a number  of  further
    applications for leave to remain and challenges to  refusals  over  the
    following years.  They have never returned to the USA and have not  had
    leave to remain in the UK since the  expiry  of  their  original  visit
    visa. Their most recent application was made on 12th May 2015 when they
    applied for leave to remain on the basis of their  private  and  family
    life in the UK.

 4. The Appellants stayed with the second Appellant's brother and sister-in-
    law when they  came  to  the  UK.  The  Appellants  have  a  number  of
    significant health issues.  The first Appellant has kidney failure  and
    the second Appellant has diabetes. The current situation  is  that  the
    first Appellant has resided in Seaway Nursing Home since  2011  and  is
    bed ridden so has not left the nursing home for over two years  (as  at
    the time of  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal).  The  second
    Appellant has limited mobility and her sister-in-law provides her  day-
    to-day care.  The second Appellant described herself as housebound  and
    has been unable to visit her husband for about two years, instead  they
    communicate by telephone.  There was medical evidence before the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge  about  the  difficulties  for  each  Appellant  in
    travelling long distances.  There was  evidence  that  a  long  journey
    would put the  second  Appellant's  health  at  significant  risk.  The
    Appellants did not attend the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal due to
    their ill health. The  second  Appellant's  brother  and  sister-in-law
    attended and gave oral evidence.

 5. The judge considered all of the evidence and concluded "on the evidence
    before me it would not be impossible for either of  the  Appellants  to
    fly but would be very difficult for them (and the  carrier)  and  would
    involve at least some risk of a deterioration in their already  fragile
    health" [25]. The judge accepted all of the medical evidence put before
    him in relation to both Appellants and found "they are  both  seriously
    unwell and  require  considerable  support  with  activities  of  daily
    living. [The second Appellant] is effectively housebound and [the first
    Appellant]  is  bedbound"  [26].  The  judge  found  that  the   second
    Appellant's brother and sister-in-law provide very  important  care  to
    her and that this dependency amounts to strong  emotional  bonds.   The
    judge considered the appeal under Article  8  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules and found that there were "elements of dependency  involving  far
    more than the normal emotional ties that one would expect from familial
    relationships of this kind" [37]. The judge noted the strength  of  the
    strength of this relationship particularly in relation  to  the  second
    Appellant. He noted that the relationships had  been  built  over  more
    than ten years.  The judge found that the Appellants do  not  retain  a
    home or have any family in the  USA  and  that  they  receive  valuable
    support from members of the local Coptic Christian community in the UK.
     In considering Article 8 the judge went through the five steps in  the
    case of R v SSHD ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and  found  that  there
    was family life, that the  decisions  involve  interference  with  that
    family life and, in considering proportionality, the  judge  considered
    that there were  compelling  humanitarian  considerations  that  should
    prevail over the strong public interest in immigration control.

 6. In the Grounds of Appeal the Secretary of State contends that the judge
    erred in finding that the Appellants are  financially  independent  and
    that they funded their own medical treatment, possibly with the help of
    payment of $510 from the US social security scheme.   It  is  contended
    that  the  evidence  does  not  demonstrate  that  the  Appellants  are
    financially independent.  It is contended that the evidence before  the
    Tribunal included bank statements showing the payment of �803  a  month
    to the Seaway Nursing Home whereas the fees charged  by  the  home  are
    �2,500 a month.  There is therefore a shortfall of �1,700 a month which
    is being paid by the local authority.  It is contended  that  it  would
    seem that the Tribunal was either misinformed or not informed about the
    cost of the nursing home.  It is contended that the sum  charged  is  a
    matter of fact which cannot be disputed by either party and that it  is
    beyond doubt that the  Appellants'  circumstances  were  not  disclosed
    accurately, that the Tribunal's conclusions were ill founded  and  that
    the Appellants have considerable reliance on  public  funding.   It  is
    contended that, given the Appellants' reliance upon help from the local
    authority, they cannot be said to  be  financially  independent  within
    Section 117B(3) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.
    It is further contended that it is clear that the Appellants have spent
    a considerable period of  time  in  the  UK  avoiding  removal,  having
    arrived in the UK as visitors and in the eleven years they have been in
    the UK they have wilfully avoided removal and have failed to  establish
    any regular immigration status and therefore the Tribunal's conclusions
    have rewarded the Appellants for their approach which it  is  submitted
    is an abuse of Article 8.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis  that  the  Tribunal's
    finding that the Appellants are financially independent was contrary to
    or  unsupported  by  the  evidence.   The  judge  granting   permission
    considered that it is not  arguable  that  the  Tribunal  rewarded  the
    Appellants' further unlawful residence in the  UK  given  that  it  has
    expressly stated that it attached  little  weight  to  such  residence.
    Permission on this ground was refused.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me Mr Avery submitted a copy  of  a  letter  from
    Brighton and Hove City Council dated  27th  April  2016.   That  letter
    confirmed that Brighton and Hove City Council  had  made  a  number  of
    payments in relation to the first Appellant. According  to  the  letter
    between 29th November  2011  and  24th  April  2016  the  council  paid
    �90,218.24 and a further payment was due of �1,521.92  the  week  after
    the date of the letter.  The letter goes on to state that  the  council
    had paid external homecare provider costs in  relation  to  the  second
    Appellant between 4th July 2014 and 11th August 2014 of �234.26 and  to
    the council's in-house homecare provider between  27th  June  2014  and
    17th August 2014 in the sum  of  �1,330.   It  states  that  the  total
    homecare  costs  in  relation  to  the  second  Appellant  amounts   to
    �1,564.26. The letter states that the second Appellant still owes  �730
    and is repaying that amount at �30 per month by way of direct debit.

 9. Mr Avery accepted that this letter was not before the judge. However he
    referred to a letter that was before the judge from Seaway Nursing Home
    dated 15th May 2015 (at page  148  of  the  Appellants'  bundle)  which
    states that the first Appellant requires full nursing care and that  he
    "funds his care here by way of a standing order from his  current  bank
    account". He also referred to the second Appellant's witness  statement
    which states at paragraph 17;

         "We both fund all of our medical expenses out of our own  money  as
         is demonstrated by the joint bank statements  enclosed  within  the
         appeal bundle.  We are self-sufficient and are not reliant  on  the
         state for support.  As can be seen from the  bank  statements,  our
         payments are made on a monthly basis by direct debit."

    According to the witness statement of the Appellant's sister-in-law she
    and her husband (the second Appellant's brother) live with  the  second
    Appellant and have lived together for a  period  of  nine  years.   Her
    witness statement details the amount of care she gives  to  the  second
    Appellant.  Her statement also states that  both  Appellants  "pay  for
    their medication and treatment out of their own money and so  they  are
    not a burden on the NHS or the state". Mr  Avery  submitted  that  this
    evidence shows that the judge was misled.

10. Mr Avery submitted that the Secretary of State did not have the  letter
    from Brighton and Hove Council because it was only when the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal was reviewed that clarification was sought from
    the council.   He  submitted  that  this  issue  only  arose  from  the
    Appellants' bundle which, having been received on 27th January with the
    hearing fixed for 1st February, was not submitted  in  compliance  with
    First-tier Tribunal directions so the Respondent had no opportunity  to
    check if the assertion that the Appellants were paying their own  costs
    was true.  He accepted that this mistake  was  not  the  judge's  fault
    because the judge relied on the evidence before him but submitted  that
    this was highly relevant in relation to the factors set out in  Section
    117B in particular the financial independence of  the  Appellants.   He
    submitted that the judge weighed up the assessment of  self-sufficiency
    based on a fundamental misunderstanding of  the  Appellants'  situation
    and therefore the judge's conclusions cannot be safe.

11. In her submissions Ms Akinbolu said that she did not  accept  that  the
    Secretary of State did not have time to  produce  this  evidence  given
    that the Respondent's bundle contains the same letter from Seaway dated
    15th May 2015.  She submitted that the Secretary  of  State  had  ample
    time and notice to seek this evidence in advance of the  hearing.   She
    accepted however that there was an issue in  relation  to  the  witness
    statement. Ms Akinbolu accepted that the first Appellant  has  been  in
    receipt of funding from Brighton and Hove City Council in  relation  to
    his nursing home care.  She accepted that it appears that he is  paying
    around �800 per month towards his stay there  and  the  rest  is  being
    topped up by Brighton and Hove Council.  She submitted that it is clear
    from the bank statements and the other evidence  that  both  Appellants
    are paying for their medical care (as evidenced by the  bank  statement
    at G7 which shows payments to the NHSS). However she submitted that  it
    is clear from the letter from Brighton and Hove City Council that there
    were two payments in relation to the second  Appellant  which  are  now
    being repaid.  She  disputed  that  the  judge  had  been  deliberately
    misled.

12. Ms Akinbolu went on to submit that, even if there was an error  in  the
    judge's approach, this was not material as this factor was only one  of
    many reasons the judge gave for arriving at  the  conclusion  she  did.
    These factors included the fact that the Appellants are 70 and 79 years
    old and that they have serious medical conditions. She  submitted  that
    the judge took account of the risks  of  moving  the  Appellants.   The
    judge took account of the unusually close links to their family in  the
    UK and the care provided by that family and the fact that this care  is
    not replicable anywhere else.  The  judge  also  took  account  of  the
    Appellants' broader ties. The judge did  accept  that  the  Appellants'
    immigration history showed that their stay in the UK had been unlawful.
     She submitted that the finding that they are  financially  independent
    is only one finding upon which the decision is based and  if  there  is
    any legal error she submitted that  this  would  relate  to  the  first
    Appellant only as it is not wrong to say that the second  Appellant  is
    financially independent.  She pointed out that the first  Appellant  is
    paying towards his care.  She also submitted that there is very  little
    public interest in removing these Appellants.  In  the  course  of  her
    submissions Ms Akinbolu accepted that state  support  in  the  form  of
    payments by the city council towards nursing home care does  show  that
    the first Appellant is not financially independent within the terms  of
    Section 117B.

13. In response Mr Avery accepted that the letter from the nursing home was
    open to interpretation but the witness statement puts that  in  context
    and indicates that the judge was misled.  He  submitted  that  this  is
    clearly material as it is a statutory consideration under Section 117B.
     He submitted that, whilst the cost of removing the Appellants may be a
    factor to be weighed in relation to the public interest, the  costs  of
    them remaining here are significant  also.   The  degree  of  financial
    independence in this case reflects a considerable burden on  the  state
    and is therefore a very significant factor and swings  the  balance  in
    favour of the public interest.

Error of Law

14. The first issue arising is that of the new evidence  submitted  by  the
    Secretary of State.  I note Ms Akinbolu's submission that the Secretary
    of State did have time to seek this evidence in advance of the  hearing
    and I accept that the letter from Seaway Nursing Home referred to by Mr
    Avery was in the Home Office bundle. Therefore the Secretary  of  State
    should have been alert to this issue in advance of the hearing. In  any
    event it was of course open to  the  Secretary  of  State  to  seek  an
    adjournment of the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal if  it  was  felt
    that there was insufficient time to make a further enquiry on the basis
    of the evidence put  forward  in  the  Appellants'  bundle  (which  was
    submitted  late)  however  that  was  not  done.  Further,  the  letter
    submitted at the hearing before me was not submitted with  the  grounds
    of appeal to the Upper Tribunal nor was it submitted in compliance with
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Immigration Rules 2008.

15. I accept that financial  independence  was  an  issue  for  the  judge.
    Section 117A of the 2002 Act requires the Tribunal to  have  regard  to
    the public  interest  considerations  set  out  in  section  117B  when
    considering whether an interference with a person's  right  to  respect
    for private and family life is justified under  Article  8(2).  Section
    117B provides:

         "117BArticle 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases
         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public interest.


         (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-
             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (4) Little weight should be given to-
             (a) a private life, or
             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.


         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.


         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-
             (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and
             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
             the United Kingdom."

16. In considering the issue of financial  independence  (section  117B(3))
    the judge referred to the  assertion  in  the  Appellants'  grounds  of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal that they are financially independent
    [7]. I note the judge's finding at paragraph 22 where he said;

         "Financial independence. The Appellants say that they  have  funded
         their own medical treatment and continue to do so.  They  say  they
         have never sought any financial assistance from the  State  in  the
         UK.  The Appellants have provided evidence that they are in receipt
         of ongoing social security payments from the  USA  (page  174-175).
         Although I have not been provided with detailed evidence as to  how
         these payments became due or whether they are permanent there is no
         indication that such payments are liable to end."

    The judge went on to say at paragraph 23;

         "The nursing home of [the first Appellant] confirm  (sic)  that  he
         funds his care himself by payments  from  his  bank  account  [page
         148], there are joint Barclays account statements [page 155 to 173]
         show regular payments to both the nursing home and NHS."

    The judge went on to consider this matter again at paragraph  28  where
    he concluded;

         "On the balance of probabilities  the  Appellants  are  financially
         independent and are likely to remain so.  This includes paying  for
         [the  first  Appellant's]  nursing  home   and   their   healthcare
         generally."

17. The judge  refers  to  the  issue  again  at  paragraph  40  where,  in
    considering the factors in the Appellants' favour as against the public
    interest, he sets out three factors in their favour as - the  unusually
    close family relationships built up  over  the  last  decade  involving
    considerable dependency due  to  the  poor  health  of  the  Appellants
    particularly the second Appellant; the  ordeal  and  risk  involved  in
    removing the Appellants to the USA due to their poor  health;  and  the
    fact that the  Appellants are financially independent.  Reviewing  this
    judge's decision it is therefore clear that the judge did attach weight
    to the financial issue.

18. The judge made these findings on the balance of  probabilities  on  the
    basis of the evidence before him. In light of what I  have  said  about
    the failure of the Secretary of State to make further enquiries  or  to
    submit further evidence on this matter these were findings open to  the
    judge on the basis of the evidence before him.

19. However that is not the end of the matter in light  of  the  allegation
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge was misled by the  Appellants  about
    this issue. The second Appellant's statement states that the Appellants
    fund all of their medical expenses out of their own money and that they
    are not reliant on the state for support.  It is not clear why she said
    this and I do not have any further evidence from her to  clarify  this.
    It may be that she did not appreciate that the money being paid by  the
    couple is not enough to cover all of the  nursing  home  expenses.  The
    couple clearly significantly contribute towards their care.

20. It was not disputed by Mr Avery that the letter from Brighton and  Hove
    City Council appears to indicate that it is only  the  first  Appellant
    who  receives  a  contribution  from  the  council  towards  his  care.
    Therefore the second Appellant's witness statement is accurate only  in
    relation to her financial independence. Accordingly there is no mistake
    of fact or error of law in relation to the judge's decision in relation
    to the second Appellant.

21. It is the first Appellant's dependence on the state that has now become
    apparent. I have considered all of the findings made by the judge.  The
    judge referred in particular to the strength of familial  ties  between
    the second Appellant and her sister-in-law. At paragraph 37  the  judge
    said;

         "Whilst these two appeals have to be considered separately I  would
         regard it as a severely harsh step for them  to  be  separated  now
         having been together for so many years. If [the second Appellant's]
         claim  succeeds  because  of   her   exceptionally   close   family
         relationship with  [her  brother  and  sister-in-law]  then  in  my
         judgement it would have a devastating effect on them both  if  [the
         first Appellant] was not also allowed to remain in the UK. Although
         they do not have face to face contact I  accept  that  there  is  a
         significant degree of comfort to each of them from living in  close
         proximity to each other"

22. The  finding  at  paragraph  37  reflects  the  fact  that  the  second
    Appellant's case under  Article  8  is  stronger  and  that  the  first
    Appellant's appeal was allowed on the  basis  of  that  of  the  second
    Appellant.

23. I also take into account the evidence that the  Appellants  do  make  a
    significant contribution towards their care  and  medical  expenses.  I
    take account of the other factors which the  judge  considered.  It  is
    clear that the judge attached very significant weight  to  all  of  the
    other factors in the proportionality assessment in this case  including
    the medical evidence, the support from other family members  and  other
    community ties. The judge  also  attached  significant  weight  to  the
    evidence around the  Appellants'  fitness  to  fly.  In  reviewing  the
    evidence at paragraphs 9 to 21 the judge considers  all  of  the  other
    factors in the case only considering the financial issue at  paragraphs
    22-23. I  am  therefore  satisfied  that  the  other  factors  were  of
    significant weight in the judge's assessment.

24. Considering the decision as a whole I am satisfied that the mistake  of
    fact which has now come to light (evidence of which  could  and  should
    have been before the First-tier Tribunal Judge) did not  apply  to  the
    assessment in relation to the second Appellant. The appeal of the first
    Appellant was largely dependant on that of the  second  Appellant.  The
    mistake of fact was not therefore determinative of the  proportionality
    assessment in relation to the first Appellant.

25. Accordingly I find that the mistake of fact in relation  to  the  first
    Appellant did not amount to a material error of law in  the  assessment
    of the Appellants' right to family life under Article 8 of the ECHR.
