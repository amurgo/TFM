                                DETERMINATION

Introduction

    1. The central issue in this appeal concerns the  correct  approach  to
       the application of public policy considerations to the removal of  a
       Union citizen by reason of criminal  wrongdoing.   This  has  to  be
       addressed in the  context  of  legislative  provisions  which  place
       limits on the power of a member state to remove or expel a  national
       of another member state who has committed a criminal offence in  the
       host member state.  These limits reflect the  significance  attached
       in European law to the principle of free movement.  In  this  appeal
       it is contended on Mr Stankiewicz's behalf  that  public  policy  is
       confined to  a  consideration  of  the  risk  of  re-offending.  The
       Secretary of State contends that there is a  wider  public  interest
       which may reflect the sense of public  disquiet  which  arises  from
       serious wrongdoing.


    2. At the first hearing on 11 July 2013 we were addressed  on  the  law
       relating to this issue with a view to deciding  whether  the  First-
       tier Tribunal made an error of law  in  its  determination.   Having
       reserved our decision on this question following the hearing  on  11
       July  2013  we  did  not  thereafter   issue   a   decision.    Upon
       consideration we decided that the appropriate course was to complete
       the hearing of the appeal before issuing a determination in a single
       document.  Directions dated 13 November 2013 were  issued  informing
       the parties that the Tribunal wished to consider evidence  going  to
       the substance of the appeal before determining the questions  before
       it.  The directions allowed for the submission of new  evidence  and
       also directed Mr Stankiewicz to provide  evidence  from  the  prison
       authorities as  to  whether  he  had  addressed  his  offending  or,
       alternatively, that he was not required to do so.

    3. The appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is  by  the  Secretary  of  State
       against the determination of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  of  the
       First-tier  Tribunal  Juliet  Grant-Hutchison  and  Mrs  E.  Morton)
       promulgated on 15 January  2013  allowing  Mr  Stankiewicz's  appeal
       under the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006
       (2006 No 1003) against the decision  made  on  3  December  2012  to
       remove him pursuant to reg. 24 (3) as if he were a person liable for
       deportation.

    4. For the sake of continuity, we shall refer to Mr Stankiewicz as  the
       appellant as he was in the First-tier Tribunal.


    5. The appellant was born on 1 December 1967. He is 46  years  old.  He
       entered the United Kingdom on 13 June 2006. Between  2006  and  June
       2010, some four years later when he  was  remanded  in  custody,  he
       worked as a tailor satisfying the conditions as a  qualified  person
       under the 2006 Regulations. On 8 September 2010, he was convicted of
       causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink.
       On 6 October 2010, he was sentenced  to  5  years  imprisonment.  He
       remained in detention at the date of the FtT hearing.  He  had  been
       refused parole in circumstances over which the panel were unable  to
       reach a concluded view.

    6. On the evening of 11 June 2010, on the first day of his holiday, the
       appellant consumed a  quantity  of  alcohol.  On  12  June  2010  he
       recommenced drinking that morning. By early afternoon,  he  went  to
       collect his partner from her work. In  the  course  of  driving,  he
       killed the driver of the car driving in the oncoming direction.

    7. In sentencing the appellant, the Judge said:

         "...at 3.4 8 pm, approximately 2 hours after the collision in which
         you were involved, you were three times over the  legal  limit  for
         driving. Secondly, you deliberately drove for some distance in  the
         knowledge not only that you had been  drinking  heavily  the  night
         before, but that you had gone on to drink further on the day of its
         accident. I of course accept that this charge  is  that  you  drove
         without due care and attention, however it seems  to  me  that  the
         standard of driving at the relevant time must come at the  top  end
         of the  range.  You  were  driving  at  a  higher  rate  of  speed,
         apparently out of control and weaving about on both  sides  of  the
         carriageway. You then crossed the carriageway and collided with the
         deceased.
         Lastly, I have taken into account  that  your  actions  caused  the
         death of Mr Tourlas and what that must firstly mean to his partner,
         who of course witnessed this incident which must have  been  wholly
         horrific for her given the whole circumstances of it, and given the
         position in which Mr Tourlas ended up. And not only would this have
         been  devastating  for  her,  I  have  been  given  victim   impact
         statements from his family in Greece and it is quite apparent  from
         these that the effect  on  them  could  properly  be  described  as
         utterly devastating."


    8. The panel accepted that the appellant was genuinely  remorseful.  It
       noted that he told them he would never drink  and  drive  again  and
       that he had "no issues" with controlling his consumption of  alcohol
       and was an occasional drinker. He accepted, however, that there  was
       an occasion in Poland, before he came to the United Kingdom, when he
       had been drinking and drove his car. He denied, however, that he had
       ever taken an alcoholic drink and  then  driven  a  vehicle  in  the
       United Kingdom, except on the date of the offence.


    9. The panel was clearly influenced by the evidence of the  appellant's
       girlfriend who joined him in the United Kingdom  in  2008,  although
       they were university friends. She told the panel that she had  never
       known the appellant to be a heavy drinker and that, on  the  day  of
       the offence, this was a "one-off" situation.


   10. A report before the panel recorded that it was impulsivity  and  the
       appellant's choice to drive whilst under the  influence  of  alcohol
       but that there was no indication he would not work with the Criminal
       Justice services on his release. On risk  assessment  the  appellant
       was recorded by the panel as representing  a  high  risk  of  future
       harmful behaviour but a low risk of re-offending. If  the  appellant
       continued  to  be  supported  by  his  partner,  if  he  had  stable
       accommodation and employment and explored his impulsivity  and  poor
       decision making, this would reduce  any  future  harmful  behaviour.
       However, if his relationship should break  down;  his  accommodation
       become unstable; were he to fall into unemployment  or  to  increase
       his alcohol use or become socially isolated, this would increase the
       risk of reoffending. The Tribunal went on:


         "In the particular circumstances of this  appeal  we  do  not  find
         there is any likelihood of the appellant drinking and driving again
         for the following reasons... we find that this offence represents a
         tragic one-off offence which is highly unlikely to be  repeated  by
         the appellant in the future. As such we do  not  find  that  it  is
         proportionate to remove the appellant from United  Kingdom  on  the
         grounds of public policy or public security."


   11.  It is clearly impossible for  a  panel  to  reach  the  categorical
       decision that there is no risk of the appellant  ever  drinking  and
       driving  again.  As  the  report  made  clear,  if  the  appellant's
       circumstances substantially change as a result of outside  forces  -
       difficulties   with   relationships,   social   life,    employment,
       accommodation, money  - the support mechanisms that the appellant is
       likely to enjoy on  release  may  not  be  in  place.   Furthermore,
       consumption of alcohol impairs judgment  and,  taken  in  sufficient
       quantity, may operate to  reduce  the  inhibition  against  drinking
       more. Hence, by its very nature, outcomes  are  uncertain.  However,
       there is no evidence that the appellant is an  alcoholic.   He  does
       not have a series of convictions for drink-driving. It was  open  to
       the panel to conclude that this was a one-off offence  and  that  it
       was unlikely the appellant would ever cause another's death  by  his
       driving. This is not normally the type of offence where there  is  a
       risk of recidivism. Consequently,  it  was  open  to  the  panel  to
       conclude that the appellant did not pose  a  significant  risk  upon
       release of re-offending.  We are bound to say  that  it  would  have
       been better if the Tribunal had had before it some evidence from  an
       independent source that he had addressed the risk  of  re-offending.
       However genuine the view of his girlfriend might be  that  he  would
       'never  drink  and  drive   again',   it   may   lack   objectivity.
       Nevertheless, we do not propose to go behind the Tribunal's  overall
       assessment of the risk of re-offending.


    Legal context


   12. The offence was to be assessed  by  reference  to  the  exclusionary
       powers vested in the Secretary of State contained in reg. 19 and the
       constraints imposed upon her in exercising them  contained  in  reg.
       21.


       Exclusion and removal from the United Kingdom
       This section has no associated Explanatory Memorandum
       19. -...
         (3) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5),  a  person  who  has  been
       admitted to, or acquired a right to reside in,  the  United  Kingdom
       under these Regulations may be removed from the United  Kingdom  if-
       ...
        (b) he would otherwise be entitled to reside in the United  Kingdom
       under these Regulations but the Secretary of State has decided  that
       his removal is justified on the grounds  of  public  policy,  public
       security or public health in accordance with regulation 21.




       Decisions taken on public policy, public security and public  health
       grounds
       This section has no associated Explanatory Memorandum
         21.-(1) In this regulation a "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
       decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security  or
       public health.
         (2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.
         (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of  a  person
       with a permanent right of residence under regulation  15  except  on
       serious grounds of public policy or public security.
         (4) A relevant decision may not be  taken  except  on  imperative
       grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-
       (a) has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of  at
       least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or
          (5) Where a relevant decision is  taken  on  grounds  of  public
       policy or public security it shall, in addition  to  complying  with
       the preceding paragraphs of this regulation, be taken in  accordance
       with the following principles-
         (a)   the   decision   must   comply   with   the   principle   of
         proportionality;
         (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct
         of the person concerned;
         (c) the personal conduct of the person concerned must represent  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of
         the fundamental interests of society;
         (d) matters isolated from the particulars of  the  case  or  which
         relate to considerations of general prevention do not justify  the
         decision;
         (e) a person's previous criminal convictions do not in  themselves
         justify the decision. [Our emphasis]
         (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the  grounds  of  public
       policy or public security in relation to a person who is resident in
       the  United  Kingdom  the  decision  maker  must  take  account   of
       considerations such as the age, state of health, family and economic
       situation of the person, the person's length  of  residence  in  the
       United Kingdom, the person's social and  cultural  integration  into
       the United Kingdom and the extent of the  person's  links  with  his
       country of origin.


   13. In R. v Bouchereau [1978] 1 QB 732, the European  Court  of  Justice
       considered three questions of which  only  questions  2  and  3  are
       material for our purposes:


         The second question


         25 The second question asks 'whether the wording of article  3  (2)
         of Directive no 64/221/EEC, (the predecessor  to  2004/38),  namely
         that  previous  criminal  convictions  shall  not  'in  themselves'
         constitute grounds for the  taking  of  measures  based  on  public
         policy or public security means that previous criminal  convictions
         are solely relevant in so far as they manifest a present or  future
         propensity to act in a manner contrary to public policy  or  public
         security;  alternatively,  the  meaning  to  be  attached  to   the
         expression ' in themselves ' in article 3 ( 2  )  of  Directive  no
         64/221/EEC'.


         26 According to the terms of the order referring the  case  to  the
         court , that question seeks to discover whether, as  the  defendant
         maintained  before   the   national   court,   'previous   criminal
         convictions are solely relevant  in  so  far  as  they  manifest  a
         present or future intention to act in a manner contrary  to  public
         policy or public security' or , on the other hand ,  whether  ,  as
         counsel for the prosecution sought to argue,  although  'the  court
         cannot make a recommendation for deportation on grounds  of  public
         policy based on the fact alone of a  previous  conviction'  it  'is
         entitled to take into account the past  conduct  of  the  defendant
         which resulted in the previous conviction'.


         27 The terms of article 3 (2) of the Directive, which  states  that
         'previous criminal convictions shall not in  themselves  constitute
         grounds for the taking of such  measures'  must  be  understood  as
         requiring  the  national  authorities  to  carry  out  a   specific
         appraisal from the point of  view  of  the  interests  inherent  in
         protecting the  requirements  of  public  policy,  which  does  not
         necessarily coincide with the appraisals which formed the basis  of
         the criminal conviction.


         28 The existence of a previous criminal conviction can,  therefore,
         only be taken into account in so far  as  the  circumstances  which
         gave rise to that  conviction  are  evidence  of  personal  conduct
         constituting a present threat to the requirements of public policy.


         29 Although, in general,  a  finding  that  such  a  threat  exists
         implies the existence in the individual concerned of  a  propensity
         to act in the same way in the future,  it  is  possible  that  past
         conduct alone may constitute such a threat to the  requirements  of
         public policy.


         30 It is for  the  authorities  and,  where  appropriate,  for  the
         national courts, to consider that question in each individual  case
         in the light of the particular legal position of persons subject to
         community law and of the fundamental nature of the principle of the
         free movement of persons.


       The third question


         31 The third question asks whether the words ' public policy  '  in
         article 48 (3) are to be interpreted as including reasons of  state
         even where no breach of the public peace or order is threatened  or
         in a narrower sense in which is incorporated the  concept  of  some
         threatened breach of the public peace, order  or  security,  or  in
         some other wider sense.


         32 Apart from the various questions of terminology,  this  question
         seeks to obtain a definition of the interpretation to be  given  to
         the concept of 'public policy' referred to in article 48.


         33 In its judgment of 4 December 1974 (case 41/74)  ,  Van  Duyn  v
         Home Office, (1974) ECR 1337, at p.1350, the court emphasized  that
         the concept of public policy in the context of  the  community  and
         where, in particular, it is used as a justification for  derogating
         from the fundamental principle of freedom of movement for  workers,
         must  be  interpreted  strictly,  so  that  its  scope  cannot   be
         determined unilaterally by each member state without being  subject
         to control by the institutions of the community.


         34 Nevertheless, it  is  stated  in  the  same  judgment  that  the
         particular circumstances justifying  recourse  to  the  concept  of
         public policy may vary from one country to  another  and  from  one
         period to another and it is therefore necessary in this  matter  to
         allow the competent national  authorities  an  area  of  discretion
         within the limits imposed by the treaty and the provisions  adopted
         for its implementation.


         35 In so far as it may justify certain  restrictions  on  the  free
         movement of  persons  subject  to  community  law,  recourse  by  a
         national authority to the concept of public policy presupposes,  in
         any event, the existence, in addition to the  perturbation  of  the
         social order which any infringement  of  the  law  involves,  of  a
         genuine and sufficiently serious  threat  to  the  requirements  of
         public  policy  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
         society.


         In answer...the Court...hereby rules:
              (2) Article 3 (2) of Directive  no  64/221/EEC,  according  to
         which previous criminal convictions do not in themselves constitute
         grounds for the imposition of the  restrictions  on  free  movement
         authorized by article 48 of the treaty on grounds of public  policy
         and public security , must be interpreted  to  mean  that  previous
         criminal  convictions  are  relevant  only  in  so   far   as   the
         circumstances which gave rise to  them  are  evidence  of  personal
         conduct constituting a present threat to the requirements of public
         policy .
         (3) In so far as it may justify certain restrictions  on  the  free
         movement of  persons  subject  to  community  law,  recourse  by  a
         national authority to the concept of public policy presupposes,  in
         any event, the existence, in addition to the  perturbation  to  the
         social order which any infringement  of  the  law  involves,  of  a
         genuine and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
         fundamental interests of society.


   14. This is a clear indication that public interest  may  extend  beyond
       the risk of re-offending.


   15. In Tsakouridis (European  citizenship)  [2010]  EUECJ  C-145/09  (23
       November 2010)  the  Court  of  Justice  was  considering  Directive
       2004/38 (popularly known as the  'Citizens'  Directive')  transposed
       into domestic law by the 2006 EEA Regulations.  The Court said:



         50      In the application of Directive 2004/38, a balance must be
         struck more particularly between  the  exceptional  nature  of  the
         threat to public security as a result of the  personal  conduct  of
         the person concerned, assessed if necessary at the  time  when  the
         expulsion decision is to be made (see, inter alia, Joined Cases  C-
         482/01 and C-493/01 Orfanopoulos and  Oliveri  [2004]  ECR  I-5257,
         paragraphs 77 to 79), by reference in particular  to  the  possible
         penalties and the sentences imposed, the degree of  involvement  in
         the criminal activity, and, if appropriate, the risk of reoffending
         (see, to that effect, inter  alia,  Case  30/77  Bouchereau  [1977]
         ECR 1999, paragraph 29), on the one hand, and, on the other  hand,
         the risk of compromising the social  rehabilitation  of  the  Union
         citizen in the State in which he has become  genuinely  integrated,
         which, as the Advocate General observes in point 95 of his Opinion,
         is not only in his interest but also in that of the European  Union
         in general.


   16. As Mr McIlvride remarked, in this recent restatement of  the  public
       interest, the threat to public security by the individual's  conduct
       and the other factors noted above take linguistic priority over  the
       risk of re-offending which is then only given a  provisional  place,
       that is, 'if appropriate'.  Furthermore, the Court went  on  to  re-
       affirm the continuing applicability  of  Bouchereau  notwithstanding
       the change in the legal landscape introduced by the later Directive.
        The Court continued:


         51      The sentence passed must be  taken  into  account  as  one
         element in that complex of  factors.  A  sentence  of  five  years'
         imprisonment cannot lead to an expulsion decision, as provided  for
         in national law, without the factors  described  in  the  preceding
         paragraph being taken into account, which is for the national court
         to verify.
         54      In any event, since the Court has held that a Member State
         may, in the interests of public policy, consider that  the  use  of
         drugs constitutes a danger for society such as to  justify  special
         measures against foreign nationals who contravene its laws on drugs
         (see Case  C-348/96  Calfa  [1999]  ECR  I-11,  paragraph  22,  and
         Orfanopoulos and  Oliveri,  paragraph  67),  it  must  follow  that
         dealing in narcotics as part of an organised group  is  a  fortiori
         covered by the concept of  'public  policy'  for  the  purposes  of
         Article 28(2) of Directive 2004/38.


   17. Tsakouridis must be seen  as  a  re-affirmation  of  the  Bouchereau
       principles which we have identified above and which survive the 2006
       Regulations.  In Schmelz v IAT [2004] EWCA Civ 29 (Buxton and Thomas
       LLJ and Park J) Buxton LJ (with whom the others agreed),  considered
       a claimant who was a citizen of the Federal Republic of Germany.  He
       was born in 1950, was then in his 50s. He had  come  to  Britain  in
       1979 and claimed to have worked  thereafter  in  business  with  his
       uncle although there was no evidence of the payment of income tax or
       national insurance. He was granted indefinite  leave  to  remain  in
       1985.  The Secretary of State proposed to withdraw his leave because
       he was convicted of conspiracy to rob. He was the prime organiser of
       the crime which involved at least six others in the  highjacking  of
       an armoured Securicor van.  One of the hijackers had  been  employed
       by Securicor, and had delayed activation of the alarm  system  after
       his fellow Securicor  driver,  who  was  not  involved,  received  a
       planned phone call claiming that there was bomb underneath  the  van
       which would be detonated if the van did not follow the  highjackers'
       car. The robbery was abandoned  after  a  fire  was  caused  by  the
       thermal cutting rods which were used to get into the  van.   Schmelz
       pleaded not guilty and continued to assert his innocence.


   18. The Secretary of State sought to exclude  Schmelz  from  the  United
       Kingdom on the grounds that his presence was contrary to the  public
       interest as amounting to a serious threat to one of the  fundamental
       interests of society.  The adjudicator accepted that the  likelihood
       of re-conviction, like the risk of reoffending, was  not  high.   It
       was also plain from he did not find that the sentence of  12  years,
       in  itself  and  without  further   consideration,   justified   the
       deportation.  Buxton LJ continued:

         "However, even if he had taken that view, he would, in my judgment,
         have been justified in so finding. That is established by the  case
         in this court of Marchon v IAT [1993]  Imm  AR  384,  to  which  he
         referred. The headnote, which was accepted by Mr Juss  properly  to
         state the law, read as follows:


             "There were some exceptional  cases  in  which  past  criminal
             conduct itself justified deportation of  an  EC  citizen.  The
             present case fell into that category." "

   19. The Court of Appeal roundly rejected the suggestion that it was  not
       open to the adjudicator to treat this case, with all its aggravating
       features,  as  being  one  that  fell  within  the  ambit   of   the
       jurisprudence set out by the court in Marchon.

Contra-indications:

   20. In Essa (EEA: rehabilitation/integration) [2013]  UKUT  00316  (IAC)
       (Blake J, President, and UTJ Warr), the Tribunal was concerned  with
       evaluating the prospects of rehabilitation  when  assessing  whether
       the appellant should be removed.  The  conduct  of  the  appeal  was
       hampered by the failure of the Secretary of  State  to  comply  with
       directions  leading  the  Tribunal  to  benefit  from   a   properly
       formulated case by the respondent with the result that it was  'very
       likely to lead to less  weight  being  given  to  the  Secretary  of
       State's case  than  it  otherwise  might  have  been.'   The  appeal
       focussed on the existence of reasonable prospects of  rehabilitation
       which were capable of being a substantial  relevant  factor  in  the
       proportionality balance of whether deportation  was  justified.  The
       case summary reads:


         If  the  claimant  cannot  constitute   a   present   threat   when
         rehabilitated, and is well-advanced in  rehabilitation  in  a  host
         state where there is a substantial degree of  integration,  it  may
         very well be disproportionate to proceed to deportation.


   21. The appellant had been in the UK for approximately 12 years  thereby
       engaging the highest level of protection in the three-fold hierarchy
       set out in Reg. 21, 'imperative grounds of  public  security'.   The
       prospects of rehabilitation, however, the Court accepted  were  only
       one factor and not a determinative consideration.


         "We observe that for any deportation of an EEA national  or  family
         member of such national to be  justified  on  public  good  grounds
         (irrespective of whether permanent residence has been achieved) the
         claimant must represent a present threat to public policy. The fact
         of a criminal conviction is not enough. It is not permissible in an
         EEA case to deport a claimant on the basis  of  criminal  offending
         simply to deter others.  This tends to mean, in  case  of  criminal
         conduct short of the most serious threats to the public  safety  of
         the state, that a candidate for EEA deportation  must  represent  a
         present threat by  reason  of  a  propensity  to  re-offend  or  an
         unacceptably high risk of re-offending.  In such a case,  if  there
         is acceptable evidence of rehabilitation, the prospects  of  future
         rehabilitation do not enter the balance, save  possibly  as  future
         protective  factors  to  ensure  that  the  rehabilitation  remains
         durable.
         "If  the  claimant  cannot  constitute  a   present   threat   when
         rehabilitated, and is well-advanced in  rehabilitation  in  a  host
         state where there is a substantial degree of  integration,  it  may
         well very well be disproportionate to proceed to deportation."


   22. We have italicised the expression 'tends to mean'  as  demonstrating
       that no bright line was intended.  The words do  not  exclude  other
       elements of the public interest.  The case was not  concerned  about
       the wider elements of  public  policy  and  was  focussed  upon  the
       interplay between the risk of re-offending and the  role  played  by
       rehabilitation in reducing both the risk  and  the  public  interest
       against removal where  this  would  jeopardise  rehabilitation.   As
       appears from the judgment, the respondent had not  properly  engaged
       with the appeal process and it is not,  therefore,  surprising  that
       wider concepts of public policy were not explored.


   23. Although MG and VC (EEA Regulations 2006;  "conducive"  deportation)
       Ireland [2006] UKAIT 00053 (Mr C M G Ockelton, Deputy  President  of
       the Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal;  Senior  Immigration  Judges
       Freeman and Jordan), appears on its face to have been  heard  on  23
       May 2005, this is misdated as the decision refers to  the  operation
       of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  which
       were made on 30 March 2006 and came into operation on 30 April 2006,
       three weeks before the date  of  the  hearing.   It  was  the  first
       occasion on which the Tribunal  expressed  a  view  about  the  2006
       Regulations.  The principal appellant had been convicted of  robbery
       in 23 January 2001 for which he  had  been  sentenced  to  4�  years
       imprisonment.  During cross-examination the  Appellant  acknowledged
       that all his problems were due to excessive drinking.  The appellant
       fell into the second level of protection against  removal,  'serious
       grounds of public policy or public security'.  The Immigration Judge
       had allowed the appeal under the 2000 Regulations.


   24. The panel referred to Monsignore v Oberstadtdirektor der Stadt  K�ln
       (Case 67/74) [1975] ECR 297 in which  the German authorities  sought
       to deport an Italian worker who had accidentally killed his  brother
       whilst handling a gun which he had  obtained  apparently  illegally.
       There was no suggestion that he would commit a similar offence again
       and the intention was that he be deported as a general deterrent  to
       others.  The European Court of Justice held  that  Article  3(2)  of
       Directive 64/221/EEC prohibited deportation of an EEC  national  for
       that reason (as do Directive 2004/38 and the 2006 Regulations).

   25. The panel also referred to R v Bouchereau  (above)  relying  on  the
       following:


         "Although, in general, a finding that such a threat exists  implies
         the existence in the individual concerned of a propensity to act in
         the same way in the future, it is possible that past conduct  alone
         may constitute such a threat to the requirements of public policy."

   26. The panel continued:


         12. Subsequent UK cases, in particular R v SSHD ex p Marchon [1993]
         Imm AR  384,  have  held  that  particularly  disgraceful  criminal
         conduct may of itself merit the reaction of deportation of  an  EEA
         national without reference to propensity to re-offend:  but Nazli v
         Stadt N�rnberg, (Case C-340/97), [2000] ECR I-957, suggests clearly
         that those views were unsound as a matter of Community law.


         ...

         29. The Immigration Judge thus allowed the appeal  under  the  2000
         Regulations.  In our view he was entirely right to do so.   Removal
         of an EEA national is not to be based on past conduct but on future
         risk, and, given his findings as to the risk  of  re-offending  and
         the intention to  keep  away  from  alcohol  any  decision  to  the
         contrary would probably have been perverse.


         30. In this reconsideration we apply the  2006  Regulations,  under
         which the Immigration Judge's decision is, if anything,  even  less
         subject  to  challenge.   Applying  the  principles  set   out   in
         regulation 21(5) it would be impossible to say that the appellant's
         deportation is justified on "serious grounds of  public  policy  or
         public security".


         33. The Secretary  of  State's  grounds  for  reconsideration  cite
         Bouchereau and Marchon and assert that the severity of the  offence
         was sufficient to warrant a deportation order, particularly because
         it was an offence related to drugs.  We have to say that we  should
         have had some concerns about the Immigration Judge's decision if it
         had not been for the coming into force of the new Regulations.

   27. The Tribunal's express reference to Nazli requires us to  re-examine
       its effect.  The case of Nazli &  Ors  (External  relations)  [2000]
       EUECJ C-340/97 (10 February 2000) arose in proceedings brought by Mr
       Nazli against  the  decision  of  Stadt  N�rnberg  (Municipality  of
       Nuremberg) refusing to extend Mr Nazli's German residence permit and
       ordering his expulsion from Germany. The Court  of  Justice  decided
       that  a  Turkish  national  with  the  benefit  of  the  Association
       Agreement between the European Economic Community and  Turkey  could
       only be denied a right of residence if it was justified because  his
       personal conduct indicates  a  specific  risk  of  new  and  serious
       prejudice to the requirements of public policy.  In  1992  Mr  Nazli
       was implicated in a case of drug trafficking in  Germany  for  which
       the Regional Court, Hamburg sentenced Mr Nazli to a  suspended  term
       of imprisonment of 21 months for his part in trafficking of 1.5k  of
       heroin.  The Court decided:

       1. In the context of Community law and, in  particular,  of  Article
          48(3) of the Treaty, it  has  been  consistently  held  that  the
          concept  of  public  policy  presupposes,  in  addition  to   the
          disturbance of the social order which any infringement of the law
          involves, the existence of a  genuine  and  sufficiently  serious
          threat to one of the fundamental interests of society  (see,  for
          example,  Case  30/77  Regina  v  Bouchereau  [1977]  ECR   1999,
          paragraph 35).
       1. While  a  Member  State  may  consider  that  the  use  of  drugs
          constitutes a danger for society such as to justify, in order  to
          maintain  public  order,  special  measures  against  aliens  who
          contravene its laws on drugs, the public policy  exception,  like
          all derogations from a fundamental principle of the Treaty,  must
          nevertheless be interpreted restrictively, so that the  existence
          of a criminal conviction can justify expulsion only in so far  as
          the circumstances which gave rise to that conviction are evidence
          of  personal  conduct  constituting  a  present  threat  to   the
          requirements of public policy (see, most recently, Case  C-348/96
          Calfa [1999] ECR I-11, paragraphs 22, 23 and 24).
       1. The Court has thus concluded that  Community  law  precludes  the
          expulsion of a national of a Member State on  general  preventive
          grounds, that is to say an expulsion ordered for the  purpose  of
          deterring other aliens (see, in particular, Case 67/74 Bonsignore
          v Stadt K�ln [1975] ECR 297, paragraph 7), especially where  that
          measure has automatically followed a criminal conviction, without
          any account being taken of the personal conduct of  the  offender
          or  of  the  danger  which  that  conduct  represents   for   the
          requirements of public policy (Calfa, cited above, paragraph 27).




   28.  The  Court  concluded  that  expulsion  was  justifiable  when  the
       individual's personal conduct established a specific risk of new and
       serious prejudice to the requirements  of  public  policy,  but  the
       national court justified expulsion only  on  the  basis  of  general
       preventive grounds having the  sole  objective  of  deterring  other
       aliens.  This was incompatible with Mr Nazli's community rights.  It
       is plain  from  the  decision  that  the  decision  to  expel  Nazli
       expressed in terms of deterrence was unlawful.  The case  does  not,
       however,  exclude  other  facets  of  public  policy  not  expressly
       excluded from the Directive or the transposing Regulations.


   29. Mr  Templeton  submitted  that  Boucherau  pre-dates  the  Citizens'
       Directive and the  2006  Regulations  and  does  not  survive  their
       introduction.  The terms of the Regulations, speaking of a  decision
       being based exclusively  on  the  personal  conduct  of  the  person
       concerned representing a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious
       threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society, permit
       no margin for the introduction of  a  wider  public  interest.   The
       threat has to be an actual risk of the individual re-offending  and,
       as the previous criminal conviction does not in itself  justify  the
       decision, there is no room for  a  principle  of  public  policy  to
       operate to justify removal based upon it.  As there is  no  risk  of
       the appellant causing death by careless driving,  there  can  be  no
       threat.  The threat (or the absence of it) places a primacy upon the
       risk of re-offending which is fundamental  to  the  assessment  and,
       without it, there is no threat at all.  He relied on the decision in
       the Court of Appeal in BF  (Portugal)v  SSHD  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  923
       (Jacob, Sullivan and Patten LJJ)  in  which  Sullivan  LJ  spoke  in
       paragraphs 11 and 12 of the necessity of  the  Tribunal  reaching  a
       clear conclusion on 'whether or not the  serious  threat  which  was
       clearly present at the time of the offence, was still present at the
       time of the hearing' so as to remain 'a continuing  threat  for  the
       purposes of reg. 21(5)(c)'.  This  was  the  case  of  a  Portuguese
       national who  had  been  sentenced  to  3�  years  imprisonment  for
       battery.  In the context of that appeal, there was a live  issue  as
       to whether there was a risk of the appellant re-offending.  It  was,
       therefore, inevitable that the Tribunal had to assess that  risk  in
       order to assess the threat.  The Court of Appeal was  not,  however,
       concerned about the wider ramifications of public policy  given  the
       immediate necessity of assessing the likelihood of a  repetition  of
       the appellant's conduct.


   30. We have no doubt that the offence itself cannot be determinative  of
       removal both in logic and by reason of the words in  reg.  21(5)(e).
       It would,  however,  be  perverse  to  construe  the  expression  'a
       person's previous criminal convictions do not in themselves  justify
       the decision' as meaning they should have no part  to  play  in  the
       decision.  If  that  were  the  case,  an  appellant  with  numerous
       criminal convictions would stand in the same position  as  one  with
       none.  The meaning of reg. 21(5)(e) is to be found in the words  'in
       themselves' as indicating there  can  never  be  a  lawful   removal
       decision if the decision-maker does no more  than  recite  the  past
       offence or offences  and direct  removal  without  engaging  in  the
       personal circumstances of the offender.


   31. Mr Templeton's primary  submission  was  that  the  gravity  of  the
       offence could not justify removal but, even if  it  did,  the  panel
       reached a sustainable conclusion.  We do not accept  that  analysis.
       Whilst an intention to cause the death is not present in an  offence
       of causing death by careless driving under the influence  of  drink,
       the criminality lies  in  the  fact  that  the  appellant  permitted
       himself to become so drunk that this happened and it was  this  that
       merited such a  substantial  period  of  imprisonment.   Society  is
       damaged by criminality, even  absent  a  risk  of  re-offending.  In
       paragraph 7.141 of Macdonald's Immigration  Law  and  Practice  (8th
       edition), the editors suggest, relying on  the  decision  in  Nazli,
       that 'criminal convictions even for the most heinous crimes will, we
       suggest, never be enough by themselves'.  For the  reasons  we  have
       given, we agree that convictions alone, divorced from  the  personal
       conduct of the appellant, will not justify removal.  Insofar as  the
       passage suggests there is no room for a  wider  public  interest  in
       removal, we disagree with it.


Public policy/public good/public interest in UK jurisprudence


   32. Both Mr McIlvride and Mr  Templeton  accepted  that  there  were  no
       decisions in the Court of Session that shed greater light on what is
       contained within the concept of public policy.  It may therefore  be
       useful to consider cases in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales
       which have considered the concept of public policy.  It is  apparent
       that a clear warning must be applied  in  relation  to  these  cases
       because  of  the  terms  of  Reg.  21(5)  expressly  omitting   from
       consideration the role of deterrence  ("matters  isolated  from  the
       particulars of the case or which relate to considerations of general
       prevention") and confining consideration to one  based  "exclusively
       on the personal conduct of the person concerned  as  representing  a
       genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one  of
       the fundamental interests of society" so as to avoid  reliance  upon
       matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which relate to
       considerations of general prevention  or  which  rely  solely  on  a
       person's previous criminal convictions to justify removal.


   33. Nevertheless, whilst those specific limitations are  imposed,  there
       is no attempt  to  impose  other  limitations  to  the  wide-ranging
       concept of public policy and none should be inferred.  As the Courts
       in England and Wales, as  well  as  the  Tribunal,  have  repeatedly
       stated, where the offence is serious enough, deportation will  be  a
       proportionate response notwithstanding the fact that this will  have
       the effect of destroying the  family  life  that  exists  between  a
       parent and his minor children or a husband and  his  wife,  see  for
       example, Sanade and others v SSHD (British  children  -  Zambrano  -
       Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048(IAC).  Sedley LJ said as much in paragraph
       27 of Lee v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 348:

           The tragic consequence is that this family, short  lived  as  it
           has been, will be broken up forever because of  the  appellant's
           bad behaviour. That is  what  deportation  does.  Sometimes  the
           balance between its justification and its consequences falls the
           other way,  but  whether  it  does  so  is  a  question  for  an
           immigration judge.


   34. This demonstrates the potential power of public interest  or  public
       policy.  The nature of the public interest engaged in a  deportation
       case was described by Judge LJ (as he then was) in paragraph 83 of N
       (Kenya) v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 1094:

           The "public good" and the "public interest" are wide ranging but
           undefined concepts. In my judgment (whether  expressly  referred
           to in any decision  letter  or  not),  broad  issues  of  social
           cohesion and public confidence  in  the  administration  of  the
           system by which control is exercised over  non-British  citizens
           who enter and remain in the United  Kingdom  are  engaged.  They
           include an element of deterrence, to  non-British  citizens  who
           are already here, even if they are genuine refugees and to those
           minded to come, so as to ensure  that  they  clearly  understand
           that whatever the circumstances,  one  of  the  consequences  of
           serious crime may well be deportation ...


   35. Whilst deterrence must, of course, be excluded in an EEA case,  this
       does not exclude the other elements.  At paragraphs 64 and  65,  May
       LJ said:

           Where a person who is not a British citizen commits a number  of
           very serious crimes, the public interest  side  of  the  balance
           will include importantly, although not exclusively,  the  public
           policy need to deter and to express society's revulsion  at  the
           seriousness of the criminality. It is for the adjudicator in the
           exercise of his discretion to weigh all relevant factors, but an
           individual adjudicator is no better able to judge  the  critical
           public interest factor than is the court. In the first instance,
           that is a matter for the Secretary  of  State.  The  adjudicator
           should then take proper account  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
           public interest view.


           The risk of re-offending is a factor in the  balance,  but,  for
           very serious crimes, a low risk of re-offending is not the  most
           important public interest factor. In my view, the  adjudicator's
           decision  was  over-influenced  in  the  present  case  by   his
           assessment of the risk of re-offending to the exclusion, or near
           exclusion,  of  the   other   more   weighty   public   interest
           considerations  characterised  by   the   seriousness   of   the
           appellant's offences. This was an unbalanced  decision  and  one
           which in my view was plainly  wrong.  There  are,  it  is  true,
           references to the offences and their seriousness. But these  are
           in the main incidental or part of the narrative. I consider that
           a proper reading of  the  determination  as  a  whole  does  not
           support the submission that the adjudicator took  properly  into
           account the public interest considerations.


   36. OH (Serbia) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 694  concerned  a  decision  made
       under the pre-2007 Act framework. Paragraph 364 of  the  Immigration
       Rules applied. OH had committed an offence of wounding  with  intent
       to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s.18 of the Offences  against
       the Person  Act  1861.  The  Tribunal  allowed  the  appeal  against
       deportation. The respondent sought and obtained  reconsideration  on
       the grounds that  the  Tribunal  had  failed  to  apply  the  public
       interest considerations described by the court  in  N  (Kenya).  The
       decision was subsequently reversed.  The  issue  for  the  Court  of
       Appeal was whether the original Tribunal had made an error  of  law.
       At paragraph 16 of his judgment (with which Maurice Kay and Pill LJJ
       agreed), Wilson LJ (as he then was) said:


           I am quite unable, notwithstanding numerous attempts,  to  bring
           out of the determination of [the tribunal] a lawful despatch  of
           the appeal. In their concluding paragraphs there is of course  a
           reference to the seriousness  of  the  offence  and  a  finding,
           accepted to be amply founded, that there was a low risk  of  the
           appellant's reoffending. But such was  only  one  facet  of  the
           public interest engaged by this street stabbing on the part of a
           teenager armed with a knife. There was no reference in terms ...
           to the public interest even though such was the  matter  against
           which the compassionate circumstances fell to be balanced. There
           was no reference to the significance of a deportation order as a
           deterrent. There was no reference to its role as  an  expression
           of public revulsion or in the building of public  confidence.  I
           am unable to  subscribe  to  the  argument  ...  that  from  the
           introductory paragraphs of the determination ...  we  can  infer
           that [the tribunal] took account of these  matters;  indeed  not
           even there are  they  squarely  addressed.  I  have  paused  for
           thought  about  the  fact  that,  in  his  written  reasons  for
           deportation,   the   respondent   had   himself   not   referred
           specifically to those features. He had, however, referred to the
           need to protect the public from  serious  crime,  of  which  the
           deterrence of persons other than the appellant is ... an obvious
           component. A complaint often made is that in this court  appeals
           can be determined upon points not made or not  clearly  made  at
           trial. I am conscious of the fact that we do  not  know  whether
           the presenting officer cast the respondent's case even  in  part
           by reference to these facets of the public interest; indeed,  in
           the light  of  the  summary  ...  of  the  presenting  officer's
           submissions, it seems that he may well not have done so. But ...
           such, however, cannot affect the existence or  otherwise  or  an
           error of law in a determination. And it  follows  that,  in  the
           light of their failure to  address  those  important  facets  of
           public interest [the tribunal]  never  proceeded  to  weigh  the
           approach to them adopted by the respondent in the context of the
           facts of the case.


   37. Thus, even where the public interest is not fully articulated in the
       grounds of appeal by the Secretary of State or by  the  Home  Office
       decision-maker or by the Presenting Officer,  the  Tribunal  remains
       obliged to consider it fully.


   38. In AM v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1634, the Court of Appeal examined  the
       case of an appellant aged 43 who arrived  from  Turkey  in  December
       1993 and  whose  asylum  claim  was  refused  but  who  subsequently
       obtained indefinite leave to remain.  The  appellant  was  convicted
       with others of a drug trafficking  offence  and  was  sentenced,  on
       appeal, to 12  years  imprisonment.  He  was  subject  to  automatic
       deportation pursuant to s. 32 of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007    The
       appellant had established a family life in the United  Kingdom  with
       his wife and two sons, aged 13 and 8.  Pitchford LJ having  searched
       the  decision  letter  of  23  November  2010  and  the   First-tier
       Tribunal's determination, could  find  no  reference  to  the  wider
       public interest considerations to which the  domestic  decisions  of
       the Court have made repeated reference in recent years, (see above),
       and continued in paragraph 31:


           While  the  landscape  for  qualification  for  deportation  has
           changed in consequence of  the  2007  Act  by  the  creation  of
           "automatic deportation" of  "foreign  criminals",  it  seems  to
           me...inevitable that in  measuring  proportionality  the  public
           interest   in   deterrence   is   a   material   and   necessary
           consideration. The public interest is an important component  of
           the balancing exercise required to test proportionality (for the
           purpose of section 33(2)(a)) whether or  not  the  Secretary  of
           State expressly says  so  in  her  decision  letter  or  in  the
           presenting  officer's  submissions  to  a  tribunal.  It  is  an
           indelible feature of the balancing exercise  that  the  decision
           maker weighs the consequences of deportation  against  the  full
           import of the legitimate aim to be achieved. Mr Saeed, with some
           skill, sought to persuade the court that we could infer from the
           express language used by the FTT that it had well  in  mind  the
           public interest which the domestic cases identify. I accept that
           this  court  should  not  readily  conclude  that  a  specialist
           tribunal erred in law but also "that it is for the  Tribunal  to
           demonstrate that it has applied the correct test  when  striking
           that balance" (per Pill LJ in OH (Serbia) at paragraphs  27  and
           32). With some regret I must conclude that no such inference  is
           available. The only  expression  of  the  legitimate  aim  which
           appears in the FTT's determination (see paragraph 27  above)  is
           that which Article 8(2) expressly identifies.  The  emphasis  in
           the FTT's self-direction of law is upon the  harsh  consequences
           of separating a family which may follow an immigration decision.
           It   drew   no   distinction   between   the   public   interest
           considerations arising in immigration decisions (to  which  Lord
           Bingham  was  referring  in  Razgar  and  EB  (Kosovo))  and  in
           deportation decisions following the commission of serious crime.
           As Richards LJ held  in  JO  (Uganda)  different  considerations
           apply when the balance is to be struck against  a  separate  and
           more powerful public interest. For this reason I  am  unable  to
           conclude that the FTT did have in mind both  the  existence  and
           the breadth of the legitimate aim which  the  deportation  order
           was pursuing.


   39. The public interest is a  complex  animal  but  relies  upon  social
       cohesion and public confidence in the administration of the  control
       exercised over non-British citizens who  enter  and  remain  in  the
       United Kingdom.  In the case of non-Union citizens  it  legitimately
       includes an element of deterrence but it does not  need  to  and  it
       incorporates other elements which  may  include  the  expression  of
       society's revulsion at the seriousness of  the  criminality  or,  if
       revulsion  is  too  strong  an  expression,   its   disapproval   of
       wrongdoing. Proper account should  be  taken  of  the  Secretary  of
       State's view of the public interest as SS (Nigeria)  v  SSHD  [2013]
       EWCA Civ 550 reveals.

    SS (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 550


   40. There is a discernible movement towards attaching greater weight  to
       the  public  interest,  at  least  where  the  public  interest   is
       articulated in a detailed way in executive policy  or  Parliamentary
       legislation.  Thus, while in  MF [2012] UKUT 393 the Upper  Tribunal
       identified the weight to be attached to  the  Secretary  of  State's
       view of the public interest articulated  in  the  form  of  the  new
       Immigration Rules, the Court of Appeal in SS (Nigeria)  v  SSHD  (22
       May 2013)  stated,  with  reference  to  the  automatic  deportation
       provisions in s.32 of the 2007 Act, that the Tribunal had missed the
       point.  By saying in paragraph 42  of  its  determination  that  "in
       deportation cases involving foreign criminals s.32 of the  2007  Act
       gave clear parliamentary expression to the particular importance the
       Secretary of State attached to  their  deportation",  the  Court  of
       Appeal stated it was not the Secretary  of  State's  executive  view
       that was significant; rather, it  was  that  Parliament  itself  had
       identified the public interest and the weight to  be  attributed  to
       it.

         38...But the true innovation effected  by  proportionality  is  the
         introduction into judicial review and like forms of  process  of  a
         principle which might be a child of the common law itself:  it  may
         be  (and  often  has  been)  called  the   principle   of   minimal
         interference. It is that every intrusion  by  the  State  upon  the
         freedom  of  the  individual  stands  in  need  of   justification.
         Accordingly, any interference which is greater  than  required  for
         the State's proper purpose cannot be justified. This is at the core
         of   proportionality;   it   articulates   the   discipline   which
         proportionality imposes on decision-makers.


       Eschewing the existence of a rule of exceptionality,  however,  Laws
       LJ continued:

         "...the  more  pressing  the  public   interest   in   removal   or
         deportation, the stronger must be the claim under Article 8  if  it
         is to prevail"


    The operation of s.32 of the UK Borders Act 2007

   41. Under paragraph 24(3) of the EEA Regulations, where  a  decision  is
       taken to remove a person under regulation 19(3)(b), the person is to
       be treated as if he were a person liable to deportation.  Under  the
       UK Borders Act 2007 Act, s. 32(1) a foreign criminal (as defined) is
       subject to automatic deportation provisions.  Exceptions  are  found
       in s.33, where s.33(4) provides:

         "Exception 3 is where the removal of the foreign criminal from  the
         United Kingdom in pursuance of a  deportation  order  would  breach
         rights of the foreign criminal under the Community treaties"   (now
         "EU  treaties"  pursuant  to  the  Treaty  of  Lisbon  (Changes  in
         Terminology) Order 2011 (SI 2011/1043) in force 22 April 2011)


   42. Thus the deportation provisions in  s.32  must  accord  with  rights
       conferred by the 2006 EEA  Regulations.   In  the  context  of  this
       appeal the relationship between s.32 and the EEA Regulations is  not
       crucial to our decision and the point  was  not  argued  before  us.
       Further, the decision letter itself, whilst making reference to  the
       2006 Regulations and to deportation and to the direct application of
       s.3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971, makes no reference to s.32 of
       the 2007 Act.  The principles of UK law which we have set out  above
       may legitimately inform decision-making provided  their  application
       does not conflict with  the  provisions  of  reg.21(5)  of  the  EEA
       Regulations.  Subject to this qualification  we  consider  that  the
       weighing of proportionality is subject to similar considerations  to
       those identified by Laws LJ at paragraph 38 of SS (Nigeria).

The Resumed Hearing


   43. Following the issuing of the directions  of  13  November  2013,  to
       which reference is made at paragraph 2  above,  a  letter  dated  13
       December 2013 was received from the  appellant's  solicitors  asking
       for some further  guidance  on  whether  the  Tribunal  had  made  a
       decision in respect of whether an error of law had  been  found  and
       seeking to lodge further evidence.  The Tribunal  replied  that  the
       panel had not yet reached a final decision as to whether  there  was
       an error of law which made a material difference to the  outcome  of
       the appeal.  The panel would only do this after hearing all  of  the
       evidence on the Article 8 issues.

   44. At the same time the Tribunal gave permission for the  admission  of
       further evidence.  The additional evidence  comprised  supplementary
       statements from the appellant and from his partner, Ms Maria  Wuwer.
       There was also a letter from Ms Wuwer's employer and a  payslip  for
       the appellant.  In relation to the direction requiring  evidence  of
       whether the appellant had addressed  his  offending,  the  appellant
       relied on documents already lodged, namely a report  to  the  Parole
       Board and a Home  Background  Report  by  a  community-based  social
       worker.

   45. At the resumed hearing on 22 January 2014 we  heard  submissions  in
       relation to the substance of the appeal.  At the  beginning  of  the
       hearing Judge Jordan explained to the parties that if  the  decision
       of the Upper Tribunal was that the appellant could not be removed in
       terms of the EEA Regulations then this would be a significant factor
       in deciding whether the First-tier Tribunal made an  error  of  law.
       It was the panel's view that the issue of the risk  of  re-offending
       was not necessarily the only issue relevant to a decision under  the
       EEA Regulations in considering whether removal was justified on  the
       ground of public policy.

   46. At the resumed hearing Mr Miles Matthews appeared on behalf  of  the
       respondent.  He described the offence committed by the appellant  as
       one of  culpable  homicide  and  emphasised  its  seriousness.   The
       appellant had driven his car knowing he was under the  influence  of
       alcohol  and,  as  recorded  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  he  had
       previously done this on one occasion in Poland.  The  appellant  was
       considerably over the alcohol limit and had shown  a  disregard  for
       the safety of others.   It  was  in  the  fundamental  interests  of
       society to prevent and  discourage  such  action.   The  fundamental
       interests of society were governed by the laws  of  the  country  in
       question.  This was seen in the case of GW (EEA reg 21: 'fundamental
       interests') Netherlands [2009] UKAIT 00050, in terms of which if  an
       act  was  not  an  offence  then  fundamental  interests  were   not
       threatened.  The commission of  the  offence  showed  non-compliance
       with the rules of the host member state and this was something to be
       taken into account in accordance with the cases of SSHD v MG (Case C-
       400/12) CJEU, 16 January 2014, and Onuekwere v SSHD (Case  C-378/12)
       CJEU, 16 January 20-14.  Deportation  could  be  lawful  even  where
       there was  no  realistic  risk  of  re-offending,  as  discussed  in
       Bouchereau, Marchon and Tsakouridis, where this was justified by the
       seriousness of the offence.  There could be no more serious  offence
       than one involving the loss of life.


   47. It was pointed out to Mr Matthews that  the  offence  of  which  the
       appellant was convicted did not require  any  intention  to  take  a
       life.  Its seriousness lay in driving while under the  influence  of
       alcohol.  Mr Matthews continued that in terms of Regulation 21(5)  a
       propensity to re-offend was not conclusive  as  to  the  fundamental
       interests of society.  In accordance with Tsakouridis the  risk  was
       to be assessed  with  regard  to  the  possible  penalties  and  the
       sentence imposed.  This appellant had a substantial prison  sentence
       imposed upon him and but for his guilty plea this  would  have  been
       considerably longer.  The risk of re-offending might be low but  the
       risk of harm was high should similar conduct re-occur.  The lack  of
       a risk of re-offending  was  not  fatal  to  the  respondent's  case
       particularly where the potential consequences of a  similar  offence
       might be catastrophic.  Other  factors  to  be  taken  into  account
       included whether the appellant was genuinely integrated into the  UK
       and what the effect on rehabilitation might be.  The appellant had a
       partner in the UK but no other family.

   48. It was pointed out that the appellant has been  in  the  UK  for  7�
       years, of which he had spent 3 years and 4 months in prison.  He had
       spent 4 years in the UK prior to going to prison and it was 2 months
       since his release.

   49. Mr Matthews continued that the appellant's father and children  were
       all in Poland and he had  maintained  contact  with  them  while  in
       prison.  Despite having been in the UK  for  seven  years  he  still
       required an interpreter for the purpose of his appeal  hearing.   He
       owned no property in the UK and he had no business  interests  here.
       He was employed.  He had a business in Poland at one time.   To  his
       credit he quickly secured employment following his release and  this
       level of resourcefulness would stand him in good  stead  in  Poland.
       He was not receiving any further treatment for alcohol abuse.   This
       was in his favour but removal would not cause any interference  with
       rehabilitation.  His witness statements showed attempts to integrate
       into life in Scotland but this was not so developed  or  substantial
       as to render his deportation disproportionate.  Evidence in  respect
       of the appellant's  partner  showed  that  she  was  valued  by  her
       employer but it was a matter of her  choice  whether  to  return  to
       Poland with the appellant.   A  family  might  be  broken  up  as  a
       proportionate consequence  of  deportation.   The  risk  of  further
       offending by the appellant could not be excluded.   The  seriousness
       of the offence outweighed all other factors.


   50. It was pointed out that according to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
       offence was very unlikely to  be  repeated  by  the  appellant.   Mr
       Matthews responded that he accepted this finding but  he  wanted  to
       cover all aspects of the appeal.

   51. For the appellant, Mr Templeton submitted that  the  respondent  had
       not shown that the personal conduct of the appellant  represented  a
       genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one  of
       the fundamental interests of society.  The evidence  suggested  this
       was an isolated incident and was not indicative of  the  appellant's
       conduct in the UK.  The appellant had led a law-abiding  and  useful
       life in this country.

   52. Mr Templeton was asked  how  he  viewed  the  offence  in  terms  of
       Regulation 21  having  regard  to  its  seriousness.   Mr  Templeton
       replied that this was a legal issue and he relied on his submissions
       at the previous hearing.  He submitted that it was necessary to look
       at the present and future risk.  Mr Templeton was asked if there was
       room in the Regulations for the expression of moral  disapproval  or
       public  outrage.   In  response  Mr   Templeton   re-iterated   that
       Regulation 21(5)(c) required the  personal  conduct  of  the  person
       concerned must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
       threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.   This
       assessment must be made according to the circumstances at  the  date
       of decision.   The question was whether the appellant's presence  in
       the host member's state constituted a current threat.

   53. It was put to Mr Templeton that the notion of personal conduct  took
       account of what had happened in the past.  Mr Templeton acknowledged
       that this was so but the question was  whether  a  person  with  the
       appellant's history constituted a genuine, present and  sufficiently
       serious threat.  This was not established on the  evidence  in  this
       appeal.  Mr Templeton did not concede  that  a  past  offence  could
       establish such a threat in itself.  There had to be a  risk  of  re-
       offending.  In support of this Mr Templeton  referred  to  Essa,  at
       paragraph 32, where it was said that a propensity to, or a high risk
       of,  re-offending  was  required.   Mr  Templeton  referred  to  the
       possibility  of  a  further  question  arising  as  to  whether  the
       appellant's offending and his presence created such public revulsion
       as to constitute a threat by reason of him being in our  midst.   In
       this regard Mr Templeton acknowledged  that  the  death  of  another
       person was extremely serious.  The question of  intent  had  already
       been identified as significant.  Clearly there  was  an  element  of
       wilful recklessness in careless  driving.   Would  this  cause  such
       revulsion that the person should not be allowed to stay?  This was a
       difficult conclusion to reach.  It was necessary to have  regard  to
       the conduct as well as to the length of  the  sentence.   Would  the
       fundamental interests of society be threatened  by  such  revulsion?
       This depended on the nature of the offence rather than the length of
       the sentence and would require a rare and unusual offence for such a
       threat to arise.


   54. It was pointed out that the sentence appeared to be at  the  extreme
       end of the possible sentence for causing death by careless  driving.
       Mr Templeton responded that this was an offence the nature of  which
       was unusual and there was no intention to cause death.

   55. Mr Templeton concluded by  saying  that  he  would  not  address  us
       separately under Article 8 as  no  separate  issues  arose  in  this
       regard.





    Application to this appeal

   56. We do not rule out the possibility  of  a  case  arising  where  the
       nature of the offence was such as  to  establish  a  threat  to  the
       fundamental interests of society even where there was no  propensity
       to re-offend.  Such a case would  seem  to  require  a  considerable
       degree of affront  or  insult  upon  the  values  and  interests  of
       society.  This is not such a case.


   57. The First-tier Tribunal pointed out that the death of the victim  of
       the appellant's crime was a  tragedy  which  the  victim's  partner,
       family and friends would have to live with for  the  rest  of  their
       lives.  The appellant has served a prison sentence but has been able
       to continue his life, which the victim has not.

   58. The First-tier Tribunal  considered  the  appellant's  risk  of  re-
       offending and  risk  of  harm  in  the  future,  having  regard,  in
       particular, to the evidence of the appellant and Ms Wuwer and  to  a
       Home Background Report compiled by the Criminal Justice Social  Work
       Service of West Lothian Council.  In relation to risk assessment the
       appellant was seen by the Home Background Report as  having  a  high
       risk to future harmful behaviour and  a  low  risk  of  general  re-
       offending.  As already noted, if he continued to be supported by his
       partner, had stable accommodation and employment  and  explored  his
       impulsivity and poor decision making this would  reduce  any  future
       harmful behaviour.  If his relationship were to break down  and  his
       accommodation become unstable, and if he failed to  find  employment
       and increased his alcohol use and was socially isolated, this  would
       increase the risk of re-offending.  The assessment of the high  risk
       of harm was due to loss of life  as  a  result  of  the  appellant's
       conduct.  The First-tier Tribunal was  satisfied  nevertheless  that
       there was no likelihood of the appellant drinking and driving  again
       and gave detailed reasons for this finding.  The Tribunal  found  it
       difficult to see how the appellant would repeat or  commit  such  an
       offence in the future so as to cause a threat to  the  public.   The
       offence was a tragic "one-off"  which  was  highly  unlikely  to  be
       repeated.  It was not proportionate to remove the appellant from the
       UK and the evidence did not  show  that  he  represented  a  serious
       threat to the fundamental interests of society.


   59. We consider that on the  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       these  were  conclusions  they  were  entitled  to  reach.   In  the
       circumstances of this appeal  it  was  not  necessary  for  them  to
       proceed to consider whether the nature of the offence was one giving
       rise to such general outrage or revulsion that the past  conduct  of
       the appellant and his  continued  presence  represented  a  genuine,
       present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
       fundamental interests of society.  In the absence of a risk  of  re-
       offending, it is difficult to show that such a sufficiently  serious
       threat exists.  It was not a material factor in the circumstances of
       this appeal and the First-tier Tribunal did not err  by  not  having
       regard to it.

   60. As stated by the First-tier  Tribunal,  this  does  not  reduce  the
       seriousness of the appellant's offence or show any disrespect to his
       victim or the victim's partner or family.  The question  of  whether
       the appellant should be removed on the basis of his offence  depends
       upon the application of the provisions of European law, as  set  out
       in the  EEA  Regulations.   Even  where,  as  in  this  appeal,  the
       appellant does not benefit from the enhanced protection from removal
       for a person with a permanent right of residence or residence for  a
       continuous period of at least ten years, the regulations lay down  a
       high threshold as to when the removal will be justified  of  an  EEA
       national from a host member state  in  which  an  offence  has  been
       committed.  In the  circumstances  of  this  appeal  the  First-tier
       Tribunal did not err in law in finding for the reasons given in  its
       determination that this threshold was not met.

    Conclusions

   61. The making of the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
       involve the making of an error on a point of law.


   62. We do not set aside the decision.
