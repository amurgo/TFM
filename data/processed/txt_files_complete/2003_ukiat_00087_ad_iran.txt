Representation
For the appellant:     Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Ms H Williams of Counsel, instructed by Young,
                       Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The respondent is a citizen of Iran born  on  29  September  1983  who
      arrived clandestinely in  the  United  Kingdom  on  a  date  which  is
      unspecified, but he was certainly here on 4 March 2001 when he made an
      application for asylum after entry.  He  submitted  a  self-completion
      questionnaire and  thereafter  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  his
      application for the reasons set out in a letter dated  13  June  2002.
      We note at this point that the Secretary of State at paragraphs 5  and
      6 of that letter did  raise  issues  as  to  the  credibility  of  the
      respondent's claim.  He noted at paragraph 5 that  there  had  been  a
      delay in making the application for asylum which had not been made  at
      the point of entry and he noted also that the  respondent  would  have
      travelled through a number of countries which were signatories to  the
      Refugee Convention en route to the United Kingdom and that  a  genuine
      refugee would seek asylum in the first safe country which he  reached.
      For those two reasons he  said  that  there  were  doubts  as  to  the
      credibility of the claim.

2.    On 20 June 2002 the Secretary  of  State  issued  directions  for  the
      removal of the respondent to Iran as an illegal entrant after  refusal
      of his asylum application.  He appealed against that decision on  both
      asylum and human rights grounds.  His appeal was heard on 11  November
      2002 by an Adjudicator, Mr A M Baker, who  allowed  his  appeal.   The
      Secretary of State was represented at the hearing by Mr T  McAllister,
      a Presenting Officer, and the respondent was then represented by  Miss
      J Brady of Counsel.  In  the  course  of  the  proceedings,  when  the
      Presenting  Officer  sought  to  cross-examine   the   respondent   on
      credibility issues, Miss Brady objected on the basis that such matters
      were not raised in the reasons for refusal letter and that she had  no
      notice that such an approach was intended.  As a result  of  that  the
      Adjudicator prevented cross-examination on issues outside those raised
      in the reasons for refusal letter, although he  subsequently  did  ask
      certain questions for clarification  himself  at  the  end  of  cross-
      examination.  The Adjudicator found the respondent to be credible  and
      allowed his appeal on both asylum and human rights grounds.

3.    The Secretary of State sought leave to appeal  against  that  decision
      on the basis that the Adjudicator had  erred  in  law  in  restricting
      cross-examination in the way which had occurred.  He  relies  in  that
      connection on the Tribunal decision in Jonas da Pajxao  Costa  (17740)
      promulgated on 23 July 1998.  A similar situation had arisen  in  that
      appeal in that the claimant's representative had objected to any cross-
      examination going outside matters strictly raised in the  reasons  for
      refusal letter but had been over-ruled by  the  Adjudicator,  who  had
      permitted the  Presenting  Officer  to  cross-examine  as  he  thought
      appropriate, regarding all  issues  as  being  open  before  him.  The
      Tribunal said this:

           "It  is  the  responsibility  of  an  Adjudicator   or   Special
           Adjudicator to control the proceedings before him or her and  to
           ensure that both parties to an  appeal  are  given  a  fair  and
           proper opportunity to present  their  cases.   It  is  also  the
           responsibility of the Adjudicator to ensure that the proceedings
           are conducted with due regard to the rules of  natural  justice.
           There is no rule of law or evidence which restricts a Presenting
           Officer from asking questions in cross-examination which are not
           specifically raised by the refusal  letter,  nor  is  there  any
           obligation upon an Adjudicator to impose such a restriction."


4.    In fairness to Miss Brady, she acknowledges in the  witness  statement
      put before us that, in the light of the Tribunal  findings  in  Costa,
      she should not have objected to the line of  questioning  outside  the
      reasons for refusal  letter  and  that  is  undoubtedly  correct.   It
      appears that neither she nor anyone else present at the hearing before
      the Adjudicator were  aware  of  Costa  and  we  therefore  take  this
      opportunity to re-state the position.

5.    The limitation on cross-examination of the respondent imposed  by  the
      Adjudicator was undoubtedly an  error  of  law.   Unless  there  is  a
      specific concession, then the refusal letter does not fetter or  limit
      the scope of the case to be pursued by the Secretary of  State  before
      the Adjudicator as a party to judicial proceedings in asylum and human
      rights appeals, in which the duties of an Adjudicator are  defined  by
      paragraph 21 of Part III of Schedule 4 to the Immigration & Asylum Act
      1999.  There the duties of the Adjudicator in determination of appeals
      are defined as follows at paragraph 21(1):

           "On an appeal to him under Part IV, an  Adjudicator  must  allow
           the appeal if he considers -


                       a) that the decision or  action  against  which  the
                          appeal is brought was not in accordance with  the
                          law or with any immigration rules  applicable  to
                          the case or,
                       b) if the decision or action involved  the  exercise
                          of discretion by the Secretary  of  State  or  an
                          officer, that the  discretion  should  have  been
                          exercised differently,


            but otherwise must dismiss the appeal.


      That defines the duties of an Adjudicator in appeals  of  this  nature
      under Part 4 of the 1999 Act and beyond that it is  the  duty  of  the
      Adjudicator, as of any other judicial  officer,  to  ensure  that  the
      proceedings before them are conducted in a manner  which  is  fair  to
      both parties and which gives each party the  opportunity  to  put  its
      case as that party thinks appropriate.  It is to be recalled that  the
      burden of proof is on the claimant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  is
      entitled to test the evidence on which the claimant relies by  way  of
      cross-examination.  Save  insofar  as  it  is  permissible  under  the
      Procedure Rules to impose reasonable time limits, to seek to  restrict
      the scope of the Presenting Officer's cross-examination is an error of
      law unless it is carried out  in  a  manner  which  is  professionally
      unacceptable, bearing in mind the wide scope given to a cross-examiner
      in our adversarial system.


      We note further that where limitations have been placed on the conduct
      of either party in the course  of  the  hearing  by  the  Adjudicator,
      whether by way of refusal of applications made,  limiting  examination
      of witnesses or in relation to submissions,  such  matters  should  be
      clearly recorded  in  the  determination  with  the  reasons  for  the
      imposition of such limitations. In that way too the Adjudicator in the
      instant appeal failed to record matters as she should have done.

6.    Mr Walker sought remittal but  Ms  Williams  opposed  this  course  on
      behalf of the respondent,  seeking  to  rely  on  the  fact  that  the
      Adjudicator had raised issues by  way  of  clarification  despite  the
      limitation on cross-examination which he had wrongly, as she accepted,
      imposed upon the Presenting Officer at the  hearing  before  him.  The
      effect of the Adjudicator's restriction of  cross-examination  in  the
      present appeal is that the respondent has been unfairly prevented from
      putting his case in the way  in  which  he  seeks  to  do.   It  is  a
      fundamental  error  which  cannot  be  cured  by  the  fact  that  the
      Adjudicator may have asked certain  points  by  way  of  clarification
      subsequently because that has not  overcome  the  improper  limitation
      which was placed upon the conduct of the Presenting Officer.

7.    For the above reasons this appeal is allowed to the extent that it  is
      remitted for hearing afresh before an Adjudicator other than  Mr  A  M
      Baker.
