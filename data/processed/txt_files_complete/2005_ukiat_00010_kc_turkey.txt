                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


For the Appellant:           Mr J Collins of counsel, instructed  by  Sheikh
& Co, solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Phillips, Home Office Presenting Officer


1.    The appellant, a citizen of Turkey, appeals  with  permission  against
    the determination of an adjudicator (Mr C A Vaudin d'Im�court), sitting
    at Taylor House, in which he dismissed the appellant's appeal  on  both
    asylum and human rights grounds against the  respondent's  decision  to
    give directions for his removal  from  United  Kingdom  as  an  illegal
    entrant after refusing an application for asylum made by him.

2.    The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in June 2002.  He  applied
    for asylum shortly after his arrival.  The grounds on which he  did  so
    may be stated shortly.  He said that he was of Kurdish  ethnicity,  and
    was a sympathiser of  the  DHKP-C  (Revolutionary  People's  Liberation
    Party - Front), an illegal organisation in Turkey.  As  a  consequence,
    he had been detained and ill-treated  by  the  Turkish  authorities  on
    three occasions between  August  1998  and  May  2002.   On  the  third
    occasion, he was taken to the Security Headquarters in Istanbul,  where
    he was held for  two  days,  before  being  assisted  to  escape  by  a
    policeman who had been bribed by the appellant's  father.   He  applied
    for asylum shortly following his arrival in the United Kingdom  on  the
    grounds that he would still be at  risk  of  being  detained  and  ill-
    treated  by  the  authorities  on  return  to  Turkey  because  of  his
    involvement with the DHKP-C.

3.     In  his  determination,  the  adjudicator  rejected  the  appellant's
    evidence in its  entirety.   He  concluded  at  paragraphs  39  of  his
    determination that, "The appellant was not telling a word of  truth  in
    this case and that he had made  up  his  entire  account  in  order  to
    satisfy a false claim for asylum in the United Kingdom".  It was on the
    basis of those findings that he dismissed the appeal on both asylum and
    human rights grounds.

4.    The appellant seeks to  challenge  the  adjudicator's  decision  on  a
    number  of  grounds.   However,  his  principal  challenge  is  one  of
    procedural  unfairness,  namely  that  following   the   hearing,   the
    adjudicator had obtained further evidence from the  Internet,  and  had
    taken that evidence into  account  when  arriving  at  his  credibility
    assessment without giving the parties an opportunity to address him  on
    it.

5.    We heard submissions first from  Mr  Collins,  who  appeared  for  the
    appellant.   He  directed  our  attention  to  paragraphs  33  of   the
    adjudicator's determination in which he stated:

         "In addition in this case I have been able to download the  DHKPC-C
         logo from the Internet a copy of which I have placed in  the  file.
         It is not a red flag with a yellow star in the middle as claimed by
         the appellant, but a red flag with a red star with a yellow  hammer
         and sickle at the centre of the star".

6.    Mr Collins pointed out that the adjudicator  had  not  identified  the
    website from which he had obtained the DHKP-C logo.   His  instructions
    were that the adjudicator was wrong in stating that this logo  appeared
    on the DHKP-C flag, and that the appellant's own  description  of  that
    flag as recorded in his witness statement was in fact the correct  one.
    If the adjudicator had put this point to the appellant,  as  he  should
    have done, the appellant would have  been  able  to  explain  the  true
    position.

7.    The adjudicator had used the fact that the logo which he had  obtained
    from the Internet did not match the appellant's description of the flag
    which he had claimed to be carrying when he was arrested during the May
    Day demonstration in Istanbul on 1 May 2002 as one of the  reasons  why
    he rejected the truth of the appellant's evidence.   He  had  erred  in
    arriving at that conclusion.  It was  a  conclusion  which  had  had  a
    material influence on the rest  of  his  credibility  findings.   Those
    findings were therefore tainted as a consequence.   He  invited  us  to
    remit the appeal for rehearing by another adjudicator.

8.    We then heard submissions from  Mr  Phillips,  who  appeared  for  the
    respondent.  He accepted that the adjudicator was wrong to download the
    DHKP-C logo from the Internet after the hearing without  informing  the
    parties that he had done so, or was intending to  do  so,  and  without
    giving them an opportunity to  address  him  on  it.   Furthermore,  he
    acknowledged that the Internet printout showed the DHKP-C logo, not the
    DHKP-C  flag.   It  did  not  necessarily  follow  that  the  two  were
    identical.

9.    Initially, he sought to persuade us that, even  ignoring  this  aspect
    of the appellant's evidence, the adjudicator had had ample reasons  for
    rejecting the remainder of his evidence, and  that  the  appeal  should
    therefore be dismissed.  However, on reflection,  he  conceded  that  a
    remittal would probably be the safer option.

10.   With respect to this  experienced  and  learned  adjudicator,  we  are
    bound to say that he plainly  fell  into  error  in  obtaining  further
    material evidence of his  own  motion  following  the  hearing  without
    informing the parties of his intention to do  so,  and  without  giving
    them an opportunity to address him on  it.   As  a  matter  of  natural
    justice and procedural fairness, an  adjudicator  should  exercise  the
    greatest caution before obtaining further evidence following a  hearing
    without informing the parties of his  intentions,  and  without  giving
    them an opportunity to address him on it, if so minded.

11.   There are certain limited categories of evidence which an  adjudicator
    may be justified in obtaining following a hearing  without  needing  to
    inform the parties of his intention to do so, and without allowing them
    an opportunity to address him on it.  However, that would apply only to
    evidence of an uncontroversial and objectively verifiable nature,  e.g.
    the geographical distance between Ankara and  Istanbul.   Nevertheless,
    even in those circumstances, an adjudicator would  be  well-advised  to
    exercise caution before obtaining evidence of even that kind because of
    the possibility of misunderstanding.  By way of example, there  is  the
    possibility that the evidence may actually  have  referred  to  another
    place  with  the  same  name,  and  the   adjudicator   may   therefore
    inadvertently have been led into error.

12.   Apart from those limited categories, where the truth  and  reliability
    of the evidence cannot realistically be in any  doubt,  an  adjudicator
    should as a matter of natural justice and procedural fairness make  his
    decision only on the basis of the  evidence  which  has  actually  been
    placed before him by the parties, or which he has informed them that he
    intends to take into account in arriving at his decision, and on  which
    they have been given a proper opportunity to address him, if so minded.

13.   In the present instance, the evidence which the  adjudicator  obtained
    of his own motion and on which he based, at least in part, his  adverse
    credibility findings clearly does not fall within that limited category
    of evidence which may  properly  be  regarded  as  uncontroversial  and
    objectively verifiable.  On the contrary, at the hearing before us,  Mr
    Collins, acting on  the  instructions  which  he  had  received,  hotly
    disputed the accuracy of the evidence obtained by the adjudicator.   In
    the circumstances, the adjudicator plainly fell into  error  in  taking
    that  evidence  into  account  in  arriving  at   his   assessment   of
    credibility.

14.   We did give consideration to Mr Phillips'  initial  submissions  that,
    even without that aspect of the appellant's evidence,  the  adjudicator
    had had ample reason to reject the remainder of it in its entirety, and
    accordingly that his error did not constitute a material error  of  law
    sufficient to undermine the sustainability  of  his  overall  decision.
    However, as Mr Phillips himself acknowledged, the possibility that  the
    adjudicator's adverse, and arguably erroneous, conclusions in  relation
    to the DHKP-C flag tainted the remainder of his credibility  assessment
    is not one which  can  be  ruled  out.   In  consequence,  we  are  not
    persuaded that Mr Phillips' initial submission is one which may  safely
    be adopted.

15.   Accordingly, we are left  with  no  alternative  save  to  remit  this
    appeal for rehearing by another adjudicator.  In so doing, we are bound
    to express our concern that this is the second occasion on which it has
    been found necessary to remit this appeal for rehearing.  In  order  to
    avoid, or at least minimise, the risk of that proving  necessary  on  a
    third occasion, we  would  respectfully  recommend  that  the  remitted
    appeal  be  listed  for  hearing  by  a  full-time  adjudicator  or  an
    experienced part-time adjudicator only.

16.   This appeal is allowed to the limited extent that it is  remitted  for
    a fresh hearing  before  an  adjudicator  other  than  Mr  C  A  Vaudin
    d'Im�court and Mr P V Ievins.
