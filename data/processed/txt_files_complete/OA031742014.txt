Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Parminder Singh Panesar, the Sponsor

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Charanjit Kaur is the wife of the Sponsor Parminder Singh  Panesar.   I
    will refer to  her  as  "the  Claimant".   Her  application  for  entry
    clearance to join the Sponsor as his spouse was refused by the  ECO  on
    29th January 2015.  It was not accepted that it  had  been  established
    that the couple were in a genuine and subsisting marriage  or  that  it
    had been demonstrated with the necessary documentation that the Sponsor
    had the requisite gross income of at least �18,600 per annum.

 2. The Claimant appealed and her appeal was  heard  before  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Juss on 21st November 2014.  On that  occasion  the
    Claimant was not legally represented (as was the case  before  me)  and
    evidence was given by the Sponsor, who also spoke on his wife's behalf.
     The judge found that the couple  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage.  He also accepted that the Sponsor had at the  relevant  time
    an income of little in excess of �19,000 per  annum.   The  appeal  was
    allowed.

 3. The Secretary of State on behalf of the ECO applied for  permission  to
    appeal against that decision.  It was said that the judge had failed to
    give adequate reasons for his  findings  on  a  material  matter.   The
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE  to  the  Immigration  Rules  were  very
    specific  and  the  Sponsor  was  not  exempt  from   those   financial
    requirements.  The judge had made a finding  that  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities the requisite evidence was submitted but it was said that
    he had failed to remind himself that the  requirements  were  mandatory
    notwithstanding the  oral  evidence  of  the  Sponsor.   The  specified
    evidence had not been produced at the hearing and the judge had  failed
    to give adequate reasons for his findings on that matter.  Somewhat  as
    an after thought it was also added that the judge had accepted that the
    relationship was genuine and subsisting although the evidence submitted
    had been limited and it was  said  that  the  judge's  findings  lacked
    adequate reasoning in that regard also.

 4. In the grounds  of  permission  made  on  12th  February  2015  it  was
    considered arguable that the necessary evidence had not  been  produced
    but the challenge  as  to  the  genuine  nature  of  the  marriage  was
    considered to have less arguable merit.

 5. At the commencement of the hearing I explained the proceedings  to  the
    Sponsor.  Mr Mills produced a copy of the relevant Rules  and  Appendix
    as at the date of decision and also a copy of the judgment of the Court
    of Appeal in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ  387.   He  then  set  out  the
    position so far as the Secretary of State was concerned with regard  to
    the principal Ground of  Appeal,  the  challenge  to  the  relationship
    between the couple not  being  actively  pursued.   He  said  that  the
    Sponsor was in salaried employment and as such he had needed to provide
    six months pay slips, and a letter from  his  employer  with  specified
    information and also personal bank statements for the  same  six  month
    period as for the pay slips.  The ECO said that some of those documents
    had been produced but  not  all.   Information  was  missing  from  the
    employer's letter and there had only  been  four  pay  slips  and  bank
    statements for two months.

 6. Mr Mills continued by saying that the Grounds of Appeal to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal stated that the employer's letter and other documents had
    been submitted but in the review by the Entry Clearance Manager it  was
    said that more evidence was required but had  not  been  in  fact  been
    received.  The judge had dealt with this issue at paragraphs 15 onwards
    of his decision but he had given no consideration to  the  requirements
    of Appendix FM-SE.  He seemed to  think  that  the  production  of  the
    Sponsor's P60 form had been decisive when that in itself could not meet
    the requirements of the Rules.  Mr Mills then referred to the  judgment
    of the Court of Appeal in SS Congo as to the requirements of the  Rules
    being legitimate and compelling circumstances being necessary  to  step
    outside  those  requirements.   He  said  the  only  possible   outcome
    available to the judge was to dismiss the appeal both under  the  Rules
    and under Article 8 ECHR.  At this point I enquired of him whether  the
    ECO should have applied an element of flexibility  in  seeking  further
    information.  He said that in response that there was a review  process
    and if after the refusal all of the  necessary  documents  and  amended
    letter with all the required information from  the  employer  had  been
    submitted then the matter would have been reviewed  but  that  had  not
    been done.  In response Mr Panesar said that he told the judge  exactly
    what he had done.

 7. Having considered the position I found that the Secretary of State  had
    established that there was a material error of law  on  behalf  of  the
    judge at  first  instance  with  regard  to  the  Sponsor  meeting  the
    financial requirements as set out in Appendices FM  and  FM-SE  to  the
    Rules.  I found that the judge's  assessment  of  the  subsistence  and
    genuine nature of the marriage between the Sponsor and Claimant not  to
    be effectively challenged and that finding therefore subsists.

 8. As indicated by Mr Mills Appendix FM-SE is very specific indeed  as  to
    the requirements for the documents to be submitted.  The Sponsor was of
    the view that he had submitted all the necessary  documents  and  Judge
    Juss clearly considered him to be a reliable witness but that does  not
    establish that the necessary documents actually reached the ECO who was
    quite clear, as was the ECM, that  the  necessary  documents  were  not
    produced.  One item in particular clearly fell short of  the  specified
    requirements and that was the employer's  letter.   Appendix  FM-SE  is
    highly prescriptive as to  the  form  and  contents  of  the  necessary
    documents.

 9. A2 of Appendix FM-SE provides

         "In  respect  of  salaried  employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
         paragraph 9  applies),  all  of  the  following  evidence  must  be
         provided:

          a) Pay slips covering

               i) a period of six months prior to the date of application if
                  the person has been employed by their current employer for
                  at least six months (and where  paragraph  13(b)  of  this
                  Appendix does not apply); or

              ii) any period of salaried employment in the period of  twelve
                  months prior to the date of application if the person  has
                  been employed by their current employer for less than  six
                  months (or at least six months where the person  does  not
                  rely on paragraph  13(a)  of  this  Appendix)  or  in  the
                  financial year(s) relied upon by a self-employed person.

          b) A letter from the employer(s) who  issued  the  pay  slips  at
             paragraph 2(a) confirming:

               i) the person's employment and the gross annual salary;

              ii) the length of the employment;

             iii) the period over which they have  been  or  were  paid  the
                  level of salary relied upon in the application, and

              iv) the type of employment (permanent), fixed term contract or
                  agency).

          c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the  same  period(s)
             as the pay slips at paragraph 2(a) showing that the salary has
             been paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the
             name of the person and their partner jointly.

          d) Where the person is a director of a limited company  based  in
             the UK evidence that the company is not of a type specified in
             paragraph 9(a).  This can include at the latest annual  return
             filed at Companies House."

10. None of the exceptions referred to  in  paragraph  2  applied  to  this
    Claimant or Sponsor.   The  Sponsor  asserted  that  he  had  sent  all
    necessary documents although the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  Entry
    Clearance Manager stated that not all the required pay slips  and  bank
    statements had been submitted.  What is clear beyond doubt is that  the
    letter  from  the  Sponsor's  employer  did  not  meet   the   specific
    requirements of paragraph  2(b)  of  Appendix  FM-SE.   The  letter  in
    question, from One Call Accident Management of  Handsworth,  Birmingham
    was undated.  It stated that the Sponsor had  been  in  employment  for
    over two years and was a valued member of staff and  was  in  full-time
    permanent employment.  However it did not  state  the  Sponsor's  gross
    annual salary or the period over which he had been paid such a  salary.
    In that regard at the very least the  application  fell  short  of  the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  Although a letter had been provided it
    was not a letter which met all of the requirements of the Appendix.  As
    such the application did not fall to be allowed,  nor  did  the  appeal
    notwithstanding the fact that the judge accepted,  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities, and by referring to the  P60  form  submitted  that  the
    Sponsor was earning the income required.  There was thus force  in  the
    contention made on behalf of the Secretary of State that the Judge  had
    failed to apply the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

11. The significance of meeting the precise requirements of Appendix  FM-SE
    is set out with great clarity in SS (Congo), at paragraphs 50 and 51 of
    that judgment, in which Lord Justice Richards stated

         "50. The present appeals concern not only the LTE Rules in Appendix
             FM which set out the substantive conditions which have  to  be
             satisfied in relation to the minimum income requirements for a
             Sponsor, but also the Rules in Appendix FM-SE which  stipulate
             the form of evidence required to substantiate claims that  the
             substantive financial requirements under Appendix FM have been
             met.  Appendix FM-SE deals with matters such as types of  bank
             statements, pay slips, income, savings and so forth which will
             be regarded as acceptable.  In addition Section A1.1(b) states
             "promises of third party support will not  be  accepted",  and
             stipulates the highly circumscribed forms which  support  from
             third parties is required to take.

         51.  In our judgment the approach to Article 8 in the light of  the
             Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as  in  respect  of
             the substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix  FM.   In  other
             words  the  same  general  position  applies,  but  compelling
             circumstances would have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or
             LTR where the evidence Rules are not complied with."

12. He continued (at paragraph 53)

         "...again, if an applicant says that  they  should  be  given  more
         preferential treatment with respect  to  evidence  than  the  Rules
         allow for, and more individualised  consideration  of  their  case,
         good reason should be put forward to justify that."

13. It was not contended  in  this  appeal  that  there  were  particularly
    compelling or compassionate circumstances why the Claimant was required
    to be admitted at this point in time.  It was open to the  Claimant  to
    make a fresh application supported by the  necessary  documentation  in
    the correct form.  In the circumstances I set aside the decision of the
    First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  could  not   succeed   under   the
    Immigration Rules nor in the absence of compelling circumstances  shown
    could it have succeeded under Article 8 ECHR.  I therefore substitute a
    decision that the appeal be dismissed.  The fee  award  made  by  Judge
    Juss necessarily also falls away as the appeal stands dismissed.

Notice of Decision

There was a material error of law in the  making  of  the  decision  by  the
First-tier Tribunal and I set that decision aside.

I have remade the decision and for the reasons set out above the  appeal  of
the Claimant against refusal of entry clearance is dismissed both under  the
Immigration Rules and with regard to Article 8 ECHR.

There was no application for an anonymity order and none is made.

The fee award made by the First-tier Tribunal also falls away as the  appeal
now stands dismissed.
