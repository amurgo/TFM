Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr G. Brown, Counsel instructed by Arshed & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C. Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS
    1. This appeal relates to a protection claim. An anonymity direction  is
       therefore made.


    2. The Appellant appeals with permission against the decision of  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Bell sitting at Bennett House, Stoke, whereby his
       protection claim and human rights claim had been dismissed.


    3. The Appellant's claim was that he was at risk on return  to  Pakistan
       as a gay man. The Appellant said he had been in a relationship with a
       man in Pakistan  for  some  5  years  but  then  that  man  left  for
       Australia. The Appellant himself then left  Pakistan  thereafter  and
       arrived in the United Kingdom as a student in 2011. The  Judge  noted
       that the Appellant's studies stopped in 2012 when  the  College  lost
       its Sponsor Licence. The Judge noted that the Appellant had said  his
       family wanted him back in Pakistan with a view to him getting married
       but the Appellant had now told them in a telephone call that  he  was
       gay. The Appellant had claimed to be living an openly gay  life  here
       in the UK.


    4. The Judge heard evidence from the Appellant and from one  [AK].   The
       parties had told the Judge that the main issue was the credibility of
       the Appellant's account to be gay.


    5.  The  Judge  found  that  the  appellant's  account  of   his   first
       relationship which was said to have lasted some 5 years with Malik in
       Pakistan, "...was very superficial and lacking in a  sort  of  detail
       one might expect from such a long and significant relationship".


    6. The Judge considered the Respondent's Refusal Letter  in  respect  of
       other aspects and concluded that  she  was  not  satisfied  that  the
       Respondent was correct to make an adverse finding  about  whether  or
       not the Appellant had told his family in Pakistan about being gay  in
       a telephone  call  in  2012.  The  Judge  said  in  relation  to  the
       Appellant's explanation, "I accept this does not make a lot of sense,
       however, I do not attach much weight to this  particular  credibility
       issue raised by the respondent.  He  appears  to  give  a  reasonable
       explanation at Q106, Q107, and Q114, and I take into account that the
       appellant was speaking through an interpreter". In my judgment,  this
       shows that the Judge was able to look independently at the claim  and
       to make appropriate allowances where necessary.


    7. The Judge dealt with the Appellant's time here in the UK and said  at
       paragraph 21 that, "The appellant states that when he came to the  UK
       in 2011, he did not have a sexual relationship with another man until
       the end of 2014. I find it very significant that the  appellant,  who
       claims to have been sexually active when in  Pakistan,  and  who  had
       known that he was gay since 2004, and who says he told his father  he
       was gay in 2012, came to the UK in April 2011 at the age of  21,  and
       did not according to his own account, have any sexual relationship of
       any kind until December 2014. He had  ample  opportunity  to  explore
       life as a gay man in Manchester for a number of  years  before  that,
       and in the context of him being someone who was aware that he was gay
       and had had a relationship  in  the  past  I  find  this  lacking  in
       credibility. He says he was ill at Q173 for 12 months. In his witness
       statement, he said he had had treatment for 6 months until  September
       13 which point he started. 'researching homosexuality in the UK'.  He
       has not submitted any medical evidence. I am not satisfied  that  his
       ill health adequately explains this matter".


    8. The Appellant had relied on the oral and written evidence of [AK]  to
       support his claim that he was gay. The Appellant had claimed to  have
       met [AK] in December 2014. They were living together as  friends  but
       had also had a sexual relationship. The Judge did not find [AK] to be
       a reliable witness. The grounds against this  finding  are  extremely
       weak.  The findings were  that  the  Appellant  and  [AK]  had  given
       significantly different evidence  about  their  claimed  last  sexual
       encounter. It was also highlighted during the evidence that [AK]  had
       not even mentioned the Appellant in his own asylum interview, despite
       referring to the names of other men that he had been involved in. The
       Judge said that she had  found  it  significant  that  there  was  no
       mention of the Appellant in [AK]'s interview. The Judge concluded she
       could not accept [AK]'s evidence as reliable and she did  not  accept
       the evidence of the relationship was credible.  She  noted  too  that
       there was no other reliable evidence of the Appellant having had  any
       relationships either prior to or since the making of  his  claim  for
       asylum. It was  noted  that  Mr  Brown  had  referred  to  the  cross
       examination as intrusive, but that there had been no objection to the
       questions. The Judge said she did not think that the  questions  were
       intrusive


    9. Finally, the Judge noted the evidence in respect of the visits by the
       Appellant to the Gay Village, but she concluded  that  this  too  had
       inconsistencies within it. The  Judge  also  noted  the  acknowledged
       issues in respect of the delay in claiming asylum. The Appellant  had
       only claimed asylum after being arrested  for  working  illegally  in
       July 2016.


   10. In his oral submissions, Mr Brown amplified the grounds of appeal. He
       said that the Judge's approach was unsafe. He referred  to  the  Home
       Office Policy document. There were not many questions  which  focused
       on  why  the  Appellant  identified  himself  as  a  homosexual  man.
       Questions 52 and  53  provided  some.  An  Appellant  should  not  be
       criticised for giving more details,  but  the  Judge  dissented.  The
       Appellant had taken legal advice and  had  given  more  details.  The
       narrative was important. The Judge took the  wrong  approach  to  the
       evidence namely the lack of sexual activity.


   11. It was submitted that there was a mistake as to fact  in  respect  of
       the medical evidence. At B8 Question 2 it  was  asked  if  there  was
       reliance on medical  evidence  and  the  Appellant  had  submitted  a
       letter. It was in the Respondent's bundle.  Had  the  Judge  properly
       recognised it? It was the narrative at paragraphs  21  and  34  which
       needed to be considered. Is a Judge entitled to form such an  opinion
       and not put it to the Appellant? I was asked to allow the appeal.


   12. Mr Bates submitted that at paragraph 19 the Judge was making it clear
       that the Appellant had been  given  a  variety  of  opportunities  to
       express his sexuality but the Appellant did not take the  opportunity
       afforded to him. The Judge was entitled thereby to note that  it  was
       only much later that the further details of the claimed homosexuality
       was provided. As for the relationship in the UK,  the  Appellant  had
       had some 3 � years. It is accepted he was ill  for  some  12  months.
       That left some 2 � years. In  any  event  a  proper  reading  of  the
       Judge's finding was not  that  there  was  not  medical  evidence  of
       illness, but that there was no medical evidence of  an  inability  to
       have a sexual relationship. It was the  latter  that  the  Judge  was
       referring to. There was detailed reference to  the  evidence  of  the
       witness and that the Judge was very concerned  about  that  evidence.
       The Judge was not satisfied about the explanation for  the  delay  in
       claiming asylum. Overall it was submitted that the Judge had provided
       a rounded assessment.


   13. I heard from Mr Brown in reply. He highlighted the grounds  and  also
       pointed to the grant of permission itself. It was also said that  the
       mistake of fact must have influenced the Judge.


   14. Mr Brown also said that [AK] was in attendance  at  the  hearing.  Mr
       Brown said he acknowledged that this was an error of law hearing  and
       new evidence or updating evidence has limited impact.


   15. The real complaint in this case is that the process of assessment  of
       this Appellant's case (both at the First-tier  Tribunal  and  perhaps
       also at the Home Office)  returned  to  a  time  before  the  Supreme
       Court's decision in HJ (Iran) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department [2010] UKSC 31, [2011] 1 AC 596 and that the narrative was
       one which breached the required assessment  in  accordance  with  the
       Home Office Asylum Policy Instruction "Sexual Orientation  in  Asylum
       Claims" (version 6.0).


   16. I am well aware of the Supreme Court's decision in HJ  (Iran).   Lord
       Rodgers succinctly explained matters at paragraph 82 of his  judgment
       when he had said,

           "82   When an applicant applies for asylum on the  ground  of  a
           well-founded fear of persecution because he is gay, the tribunal
           must first ask itself whether it is satisfied  on  the  evidence
           that he is gay, or that he would be treated as gay by  potential
           persecutors in his country of nationality. If so,  the  tribunal
           must then ask itself whether it is satisfied  on  the  available
           evidence that gay people who lived openly  would  be  liable  to
           persecution in the applicant's country of  nationality.  If  so,
           the  tribunal  must  go  on  to  consider  what  the  individual
           applicant would do if he were returned to that country.  If  the
           applicant would in fact live openly and thereby be exposed to  a
           real risk of persecution, then he has  a  well-founded  fear  of
           persecution-even  if  he  could  avoid  the   risk   by   living
           "discreetly". If, on the other hand, the tribunal concludes that
           the applicant  would  in  fact  live  discreetly  and  so  avoid
           persecution, it must go on to ask itself why he would do so. If
           the tribunal concludes that the applicant would choose  to  live
           discreetly simply because that was how he himself would wish  to
           live, or because of  social  pressures,  e  g,  not  wanting  to
           distress  his  parents  or  embarrass  his  friends,  then   his
           application should be rejected. Social pressures of that kind do
           not amount to persecution and  the  Convention  does  not  offer
           protection against them. Such a person has no well-founded  fear
           of persecution because, for reasons that have nothing to do with
           any fear of persecution, he himself chooses to adopt  a  way  of
           life which means that he is not in fact liable to be persecuted
           because he is gay. If, on the other hand, the tribunal concludes
           that a material reason for the applicant  living  discreetly  on
           his return would be a fear of the persecution which would follow
           if he were to live openly as a gay man, then, other things being
           equal, his application should be accepted. Such a person  has  a
           well-founded fear of persecution. To reject his  application  on
           the ground  that  he  could  avoid  the  persecution  by  living
           discreetly  would  be  to  defeat  the  very  right  which   the
           Convention exists to protect-his right to live freely and openly
           as a gay man without fear of persecution. By  admitting  him  to
           asylum and allowing him to live freely and openly as a  gay  man
           without fear of persecution, the receiving state gives effect to
           that right by  affording  the  applicant  a  surrogate  for  the
           protection from persecution which  his  country  of  nationality
           should have afforded him."

   17. The Respondent's Policy Instruction which Mr Brown referred to  makes
       clear at page 44 under the  section  "Preparing  for  Interview:  LGB
       Specific  Issues  to  Consider"  that,  "An   LGB   person's   sexual
       orientation is not solely or  even  necessarily  partly,  defined  by
       their participation in sexual behaviour and, in any case, this aspect
       of their behaviour may, in some claims, be irrelevant due to  factors
       such as religious beliefs or cultural restrictions."


   18. Thankfully the deplorable days of gay  person  feeling  compelled  to
       prove that they are gay with video evidence and the like are  of  the
       past, but the point Mr Brown makes is important and that  in  reality
       the Judge was expecting too much. She wanted to see and hear evidence
       of relationships that the Appellant had entered into.


   19. I have considered this submission and the other submission with  care
       and despite Mr Brown's eloquent arguments I am  not  able  to  accept
       them.


   20. My  reasons  are  as  follows.  Firstly,  it  cannot  be  ignored  or
       overlooked that the Appellant was free to  present  his  case  as  he
       wished. He was represented by experienced Counsel and  solicitors  at
       his hearing at the First-tier Tribunal. The Appellant had relied on a
       witness statement and on the oral evidence of [AK].  The  Appellant's
       evidence and that  of  [AK]  was  that  the  couple  had  been  in  a
       relationship. With clear and strong reasons the Judge  explained  why
       she did not accept that evidence. Indeed, so strong are those reasons
       that the best that could be said in the grounds  about  the  weakness
       and unreliability of [AK]'s evidence was that  the  couple  had  only
       been together for two months in February 2015.  That  fails  to  take
       into account though that the  Judge  had  seen  and  heard  from  the
       witness. She was not given any proper and  consistent  evidence  from
       the Appellant and [AK] about  their  claimed  last  sexual  encounter
       which was not just two months after they met in 2015 but in  2017.  I
       see no basis whatsoever why that finding was wrong in  law.   It  was
       well reasoned. It was compelling reasoning in my judgment.


   21.  Secondly,  whilst  I  accept  that  it   will   always   have   been
       uncomfortable, and almost certainly embarrassing  and  difficult  for
       the Appellant and [AK] to have given evidence, the point  being  made
       by the Respondent is that it was evidence that they gave of their own
       volition. It was the Appellant and  [AK]  who  decided  to  give  the
       evidence that they did. Once given, the Judge had  decided  upon  its
       veracity. She decided that she did not accept it. The Judge noted two
       particular  aspects  of  the  evidence  that  wholly  undermined  it.
       Firstly, the discrepancy and inconsistency about the last  encounter.
       I have to say that it is difficult to see how or why such  a  mistake
       could have been made by the Appellant and [AK], even when taking into
       account  the  difficulties  of  giving  evidence  in  an   unfamiliar
       environment about such personal  matters.  Secondly,  there  was  the
       failure of  [AK]  to  refer  to  the  Appellant  in  his  own  asylum
       interview. I just cannot understand why [AK] could refer to the other
       men he had past relationships with, but not with the man he had  been
       having a relationship with at that current time for some two  months.
       In my judgment, the Judge made perfectly  proper  findings  on  these
       matters. It appears to me that the evidence was of such  significance
       that it could not be just left and ignored. It was  in  one  sense  a
       very important part of the Appellant's case. Namely the Appellant was
       contending he was gay, that his partner was gay and that his  partner
       had come  to  give  evidence  to  prove  the  past  and  more  recent
       relationship.


   22. Thirdly, again, having at the forefront, the importance  of  ensuring
       fairness in this type of claim  for  asylum  and  the  understandable
       difficulties that Appellants have  in  explaining  themselves,  their
       feelings and their thoughts, I turn to the  submissions  and  grounds
       relating to the medical evidence. Mr Brown submits that there was  an
       error of fact  because  there  was  a  medical  report  referring  to
       tuberculosis in 2013. It is submitted that therefore  the  Judge  was
       wrong to say that the Appellant could have had a relationship for 3 �
       years but had failed to do so. I  do  not  accept  that  the  Judge's
       decision at paragraph 21 did not appreciate the medical  evidence  of
       the TB because the Judge said, "I  am  not  satisfied  that  his  ill
       health adequately explained the matter.' In my  judgment,  the  Judge
       noted the medical evidence was that the Appellant had  suffered  with
       TB, but that was not sufficient to explain the remaining time period.
       Even if I am wrong about that, the Judge was quite entitled to wonder
       why the period from 2013 to thereafter remained  a  period  in  which
       there was a gap in evidence about any claimed  relationships  or  the
       like. It is important to highlight that this  was  not  an  Appellant
       saying he was remaining abstinent or the like. His evidence was  that
       he had positively sought to engage in sexual activity and in the  gay
       scene. In the circumstances, the Judge was quite entitled to ask  why
       the evidence of such activity was largely either after the refusal of
       the claim for asylum or of the type of being  untrue  in  respect  of
       [AK], the claimed partner.


   23. Fourthly, I understand and agree with  Mr  Brown's  submissions  that
       there must not be a narrative  of  defining  the  Appellant's  sexual
       orientation by his participation in sexual behaviour.  In  any  case,
       this aspect may be irrelevant in some claims because of  things  such
       as religious beliefs and because of the way things are  in  Pakistan,
       but in this case the Judge  was  asked  to  deal  with  the  evidence
       presented to her and she made findings in respect of that evidence. I
       see  no  error  in  approach  or  conflict  with  the  Asylum  Policy
       Instruction.


   24. Fifthly, the Judge noted that the Appellant had only  claimed  asylum
       in July 2016 when he had been arrested for working illegally here  in
       the UK. The Judge properly took into account section 8 issues. I  see
       no reason why that was an error of law. It was not a significant part
       of the findings, but  added  to  the  overall  unreliability  of  the
       Appellant's claim.


   25. Finally, as noted at paragraph 13 of the Judge's decision, the agreed
       main basis of the hearing was to assess  whether  the  Appellant  was
       credible in his account that he is gay. Put another  way,  the  Judge
       was being asked to consider the first of the questions from paragraph
       82 of HJ (Iran). The Judge concluded that the Appellant was not  gay.
       Her reasoning was adequate. It was the Appellant's own evidence  that
       she had scrutinised to come to that decision. It  was  the  Appellant
       who had put forward evidence of his  sexual  activity,  relationships
       and the like.  In reality, very little of the grounds of appeal focus
       on the actual findings  of  the  Judge  but  instead  set  out  large
       extracts of the Asylum Policy Instruction used as grounds of appeal.


   26. Some Judges may not have found against the Appellant but  this  Judge
       did. I have not been able to identify any material error  of  law  in
       the Judge's conclusions.


   27. I therefore conclude that there is no material error of  law  in  the
       Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.

Notice of Decision

There is no error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

The Appellant's appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.
