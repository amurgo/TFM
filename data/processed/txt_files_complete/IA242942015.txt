                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Devittie, promulgated on 6th June 2018, following  a  hearing  at
    Taylor House on 19th January 2018.  In  the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal  of  the  Appellant  on  humanitarian  grounds,  but
    dismissed it on asylum grounds.  The Respondent,  Secretary  of  State,
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen  of  Egypt,  and  was  born  on  1st
    January 1997.  He arrived in the UK on 30th January  2014  and  claimed
    asylum as an  unaccompanied  minor,  being  aged  17.   The  Respondent
    refused the application on 6th May 2014, but on  account  of  his  age,
    granted him discretionary leave to remain until he had attained the age
    of 17ï¿½  years,  which  would  have  been  until  1st  July  2014.   The
    Respondent came to the decision that she was not satisfied  that  there
    were adequate reception arrangements in place in Egypt.

 3. Thereafter, the Appellant submitted an application for leave to  remain
    on 16th June 2014, mentioning that his removal to  Egypt  would  breach
    his rights under the European Convention of Human Rights.  On 15th June
    2015, the Respondent refused the Appellant's  application  for  further
    leave to remain.  This is the important decision in this  appeal.   The
    Respondent did so without considering  the  Appellant's  asylum  claim.
    The Appellant then brought an appeal against the refusal  of  leave  on
    human rights grounds.  The Respondent stated that the decision was only
    appealable on human rights grounds.  On 15th September 2016 the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal.   This  was  done  on
    humanitarian protection grounds as well as on human rights grounds.  On
    16th June 2017, Upper Tribunal Judge Gleeson  made  a  finding  to  the
    effect that "the Appellant had not  made  an  international  protection
    claim" and that he had been unrepresented, but that  if  he  wished  to
    proceed further, it would be advisable on receipt of this decision, for
    his new solicitors to do the following.  First, to  clarify  the  claim
    which the Appellant wished to make.  Second,  to  make  sure  that  the
    Grounds of Appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  reflected  this  claim.
    Third, to ensure that the application is made in person.  And  finally,
    to ensure that further submissions are made under paragraph 353 of  the
    Immigration Rules.

The Judge's Findings

 4. When Judge Devittie sat to hear this case on 19th January 2018, it  was
    an  unfortunate  aspect  of  this  case,  that   the   Respondent   was
    unrepresented, although there were written  objections  to  the  appeal
    going forward on asylum grounds, until such time that  the  matter  had
    been properly considered by the Secretary of State,  so  as  to  ensure
    that the Appellant was not deprived of a right of  appeal  pursuant  to
    that decision.  At the hearing also, the Appellant's representative, Mr
    T Aitken, was reluctant to proceed, on the basis of an amendment to the
    Grounds of Appeal, because as Judge Devittie recorded, the basis of the
    Rules was that "even an amendment to the Grounds of  Appeal  could  not
    give life to an asylum appeal", because it was  possible  to  raise  an
    asylum claim, as an amended Ground of Appeal, only where the Respondent
    had first refused a protection claim, as defined by Section 82(2).

 5. Notwithstanding objections both from  the  Appellant's  representative,
    and the written objection from the Respondent Secretary of  State,  the
    judge proceeded to hear the appeal.   This  is  not  to  say  that  the
    judge's consideration of the matter was anything other than  meticulous
    in his consideration, and careful in his analysis.  What the judge said
    was that "Counsel's construction is too restrictive in a way that could
    not have been intended by the legislator" and that the statutory appeal
    scheme "is not designed to place undue procedural restrictions  on  the
    right of an applicant to broaden his appeal ground to include  a  claim
    under the Refugee Convention" (paragraph 17).

 6. Indeed, if one looked at Section 82(1) it was clear that "the  Tribunal
    can consider any matter raised in the  statement  which  constitutes  a
    Ground of Appeal".  Judge Devittie went on to say that the way in which
    Section 84(2) is worded is such that it "is not intended to impose  the
    restriction contended for" (paragraph 17(2)).  The judge went on to say
    that "it cannot be the case that the Appellant is being deprived  of  a
    first instance decision" because in the Appellant's case, "he does  not
    raise a basis for asylum different  to  that  which  has  already  been
    considered by the Respondent.  He  has  submitted  further  documentary
    evidence in support of his appeal.  It is not contended that  this  new
    evidence constitutes a fresh asylum claim" (see paragraph 17(3)).

 7. Having heard the appeal, the judge then went on to make  findings  (see
    paragraphs 20 to 23) which were in favour of the Appellant.

 8. The judge allowed the appeal.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application, are prolix and elaborate.  The  point  that
    they make under the  heading  "procedural  irregularity"  is  that  the
    Secretary of State was deprived of "fairness  in  the  proceedings  and
    objective treatment of the Secretary of  State  to  properly  make  his
    case" (see paragraph 5).

10. On 8th August 2018, permission to appeal was granted on the basis  that
    it was arguable that proceeding with the appeal, as Judge Devittie did,
    was to:

         "Deprive the Secretary  of  State  from  properly  considering  the
         matter and was procedurally unfair.  It appears that the judge  may
         not have given the Secretary of State sufficient  time  to  address
         the issue or the evidence presented and so may have erred in  doing
         so" (see paragraph 3).

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me, however, what has been submitted by  Ms  Pal,
    was that this was a  case  which  required  the  Secretary  of  State's
    "consent" in that it was a "new matter" such that, without the  consent
    being forthcoming, the judge could not proceed to deal with it.  I have
    to say immediately that this is not the way in  which  the  matter  was
    argued, either before Judge Devittie, in the written objections of  the
    Secretary of State, or in the rather elaborate and confusing Grounds of
    Appeal by the Secretary of State to that decision, nor  indeed  in  the
    grant of permission by Judge Parkes on 8th August  2018,  which  simply
    states that "the judge may  not  have  given  the  Secretary  of  State
    sufficient time to address the issue".

12. The way in which the matter has been conceived so far is  in  terms  of
    "procedural  unfairness".   It  is  not  in  terms  of  the   statutory
    requirement that if a "new matter" is  introduced,  that  requires  the
    "consent" of the Secretary of State.  Indeed  the  decision  in  Mahmud
    [2017] is clear that the Secretary  of  State  "must  consent"  to  the
    consideration of any new matter.  Be that as it may, both Ms  Pal,  who
    was appealing the decision of Judge Devittie  before,  and  Mr  Rendle,
    were in agreement that the decision should be set aside as a matter  of
    law.  In this respect, I find Mr Rendle's submissions to  be  far  more
    compelling.

13. He placed reliance  upon  the  "post-hearing  submissions"  dated  22nd
    January 2018, by Mr Aitken, who had appeared as Counsel  on  behalf  of
    the Appellant at the hearing below before Judge Devittie.  These  post-
    hearing written submissions are detailed, comprehensive and clear.   He
    makes the following salient points.

14. First, that the Appellant was concerned that by applying to  amend  his
    Grounds of Appeal, the Appellant would be  deprived  of  an  additional
    level of decision making, and be denied the  opportunity  to  have  his
    case fully considered by the Respondent in  respect  of  his  continued
    fear of returning to Egypt.  This was important because he was  now  in
    possession of documentary  evidence,  which  had  not  previously  been
    available (see the  Appellant's  bundle  at  pages  15  to  32),  which
    demonstrated that the Appellant had been sentenced to a period  of  ten
    years' imprisonment in his absence.  Mr Aitken made it  clear  that  if
    the evidence that the Appellant was seeking to rely upon  was  rejected
    by the Respondent then this should result in a new appealable  decision
    being made, or the Respondent issuing a supplementary decision  letter.



15. The second matter raised by Mr Aitken, and relied upon  by  Mr  Rendle,
    was that the Appellant's representative raised the issue as to  whether
    the current statutory regime even permits the Appellant  to  amend  his
    Grounds of Appeal in the  manner  suggested  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Gleeson.  The Respondent's decision was dated  15th  June  2015.   This
    decision refused the Appellant's human rights claim.  It was a decision
    that fell within Section 82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act.  Under Section 84(2)
    of the 2002 Act, an appeal under Section 82(1)(b) must  be  brought  on
    the ground that the Respondent's decision is unlawful under  Section  6
    of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998,  as  being  incompatible  with   the
    Appellant's Convention rights.

16. It would appear from the wording of Section 84(1) of the 2002  Act  (as
    amended) that it is possible only to raise an asylum ground as a Ground
    of Appeal where the Respondent has refused  a  "protection  claim",  as
    defined by Section 82(2) of  the  2002  Act.   Since  the  Respondent's
    decision of 15th June 2015 was not a refusal of  a  "protection  claim"
    the Appellant was concerned  that,  without  the  Respondent's  consent
    being issued under Section 85 of the 2002 Act (as amended) the Tribunal
    would not have jurisdiction  to  consider  the  Appellant's  appeal  on
    asylum grounds as proposed by UTJ Gleeson  (see  paragraph  30  of  the
    written submissions).

17. It is in these circumstances, and for the reasons set out above,  that,
    given the statutory injunction that, without the Secretary  of  State's
    consent to a "new matter" an appeal simply cannot proceed, that I  must
    conclude that the judge below fell into error, that was material to the
    determination, such that it must be set aside.

Notice of Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed to the extent that it is remitted back to a  judge  other  than
    Judge Devittie, to be considered  again,  pending  a  decision  on  the
    stated "new matter" by the Secretary of State.

19. This appeal is allowed.

20. An anonymity direction is made.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
