Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr S Bhanji, instructed by Nasim & Co solicitors
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    Whilst this is an appeal by the Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO),  for
  convenience I will refer to the parties  in  the  determination  as  they
  appeared before the First-tier Tribunal.

2.  The appellant, a  national  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
  Tribunal against the decision of the ECO dated 26 June 2013 to refuse her
  application for entry clearance to the UK as the partner of Usman  Hashmi
  (the sponsor) under Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  First-tier
  Tribunal Judge S Aziz allowed the appeal and the  ECO  now  appeals  with
  permission to this Tribunal.

3. The appellant's case is that the sponsor is self-employed in the UK.  The
  ECO refused the application for entry clearance on  the  basis  that  the
  appellant had not provided the specified evidence in relation to his self-
  employment set out in Appendix FM-SE.



Error of law

4. It is accepted by  the  appellant  in  the  skeleton  argument  that  the
  sponsor needs to show an income of ï¿½18,600. The issue in this  appeal  is
  the period in relation to which the  income  must  be  demonstrated.  The
  appellant made the application for entry clearance on 15 March 2013.  The
  sponsor attended the  appeal  hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
  submitted further evidence in relation to the tax  year  2012-2013  which
  the First-tier Tribunal Judge considered. On the basis of  this  evidence
  the First-tier Tribunal Judge was satisfied that the  appellant  met  the
  requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

5. However Appendix FM -SE D (in force at the  relevant  date)  states  that
  the ECO could consider only documents  submitted  with  the  application.
  Appendix FM -SE 7 sets out the evidence to be provided by a self-employed
  sponsor. This includes evidence of the amount  of  tax  payable  for  the
  'last financial year', the latest annual self-assessment  tax  return  to
  HMRC and bank statements for the same 12 month period as the tax  return.
  At the date of the application the last financial year was 2011-2012. The
  tax return for 2012-2013 could not have been available as  the  tax  year
  was not yet completed.

6. Mr Bhanji sought to submit that the term 'financial year'  relates  to  a
  self-employed person's  accounting  year.  He  relied  on  the  sponsor's
  accounts for the period from 1 April 2012-31 January 2013. However  I  am
  satisfied that, in the absence of an alternative  interpretation  in  the
  Rules, the phrase 'last financial year' must be given its normal  meaning
  and must relate, in this case, to the period between 1 April 2011 and  31
  March 2012 being the last full financial year before the application  was
  made. Mr Bhanji was unable to show that the sponsor's tax return or  bank
  statements for the financial year 2011-2012 were  before  the  First-tier
  Tribunal Judge.

7. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  erred  in  considering
  that the financial year 2012-2013 was the relevant period and in  finding
  that the specified evidence for the required period had  been  submitted.
  As this error is material I must set the decision aside.

Remaking the decision

8. Mr Bhanji confirmed that there was no further evidence to be  adduced.  I
  therefore remake the decision on the basis of  the  evidence  before  the
  First-tier Tribunal. The relevant period is the financial year 2011-2012.
  Some documents have been provided for that period.  However  the  sponsor
  did not submit the tax return for that period or his business or personal
  bank statements for that period. As the appellant has  not  provided  the
  specified evidence in accordance with Appendix FM-SE  the  appeal  cannot
  succeed.

Conclusion:
The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on point of law.

I set the decision aside and remake it by dismissing the appeal.

Signed
                       Date: 7 January 2015

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal
