                            DECISION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  Judge
   of the First-tier Tribunal Freer allowing an appeal by Mr Mirza  Shamayel
   Mustafa (hereinafter referred to as "the applicant").

2) This appeal has a lengthy history.  The  appeal  was  brought  against  a
   decision dated 14 February 2014 by the Secretary  of  State  refusing  an
   application for leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  and
   making a decision to remove the applicant.  The appeal was heard  in  May
   2014 before the First-tier Tribunal and dismissed.  There was  an  appeal
   to the Upper Tribunal, which was heard in August 2014.   The  appeal  was
   remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard before a different  judge
   with no findings preserved.

3) Following the remittal the appeal was heard in January 2015 before  Judge
   Freer, who allowed the appeal.  The Secretary of State was  then  granted
   permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

4) The hearing then came before me on 28 July 2015.  I found errors  of  law
   in the decision by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Freer such  that  the
   decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside.  I sought to re-
   make the decision in the Upper Tribunal.  On  the  day  of  the  hearing,
   however, there was  insufficient  time  available  and  counsel  for  the
   claimant did not have before her all the documentary evidence  which  had
   been before the First-tier Tribunal.  Because of  this  the  hearing  was
   adjourned for the decision to be re-made at a later  hearing  before  the
   Upper Tribunal.

5) The appeal came back before me on 26  November  2015.   At  this  hearing
   there was a different counsel  for  the  applicant,  namely  Mr  G  Coll.
   There was discussion, to which I will  refer  further  below,  about  the
   intended scope of the resumed hearing.

Error of law

6) My decision finding an error of law was  issued  to  the  parties  on  28
   October 2015.  I do not proposed to repeat at length the  terms  of  that
   decision but I will refer to the salient points.

7)  The  grounds  upon  which  the  Secretary  of  State  had  refused   the
   application for leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  were  that  the
   applicant had not shown that he was a genuine entrepreneur or that he had
   access to the funds required under the Rules.  Judge Freer made  findings
   in favour of the applicant in relation to  both  of  these  issues.   The
   Secretary of State argued that this decision was flawed by  a  number  of
   errors.  My decision on these errors of law was as follows:

    "22) I find that there are errors of law in the decision by  the  Judge
       of the First-tier Tribunal such that it should be set aside and  re-
       made.  First, the judge referred to the  wrong  standard  of  proof.
       This may be a word-processing error.  Even so, it indicates  a  lack
       of care.  Where, as in an appeal such as this, there are  issues  of
       credibility and conflicts in the evidence, it is difficult  for  the
       parties to be satisfied that the proper standard of proof  has  been
       applied where there has been a  misdirection  of  this  nature.   Ms
       Stein submitted that the misdirection by the judge was not shown  to
       be material.  This submission would have  carried  more  weight  had
       there  been  fewer  contentious   issues   arising   from   apparent
       discrepancies in the evidence.  In an appeal such as this the losing
       party was entitled to know that any findings made by the  judge  had
       been made on a proper basis having regard to the correct standard of
       proof.  This is not the case in relation to this decision.


   23) The Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  consider  that  the
       Secretary of State was entitled to take into  account  in  making  a
       decision that the applicant had no experience of setting up his  own
       business.  The judge actually referred to this, at paragraph 46,  as
       imposing an additional requirement outside the Rules.  On this point
       the judge made  a  misdirection  in  law.   In  terms  of  paragraph
       245DD(i)(iv) in making an assessment as  to  whether  the  applicant
       genuinely intends and is able to establish, take over  or  become  a
       director of one or more businesses in the UK, the Secretary of State
       is  entitled  to  take  into  account   the   applicant's   previous
       educational and business experience (or lack  thereof).   The  judge
       might not have erred had the judge decided  that  the  Secretary  of
       State had placed too much weight on this issue and  that  there  was
       countervailing evidence  indicating  that  the  applicant  would  be
       capable of running his own business but this is not what  the  judge
       stated.   However,  the  judge  stated  at  paragraph  46  that  the
       Secretary of State had applied a requirement which was  not  in  the
       Rules and for the judge to state this was clearly an error  of  law.
       As this point went directly to one of  the  issues  in  the  appeal,
       namely whether the claimant genuinely intended to set up a  business
       in the UK, it cannot be said that the judge's misdirection would not
       have affected the outcome of the appeal.


   24) On the basis of these two errors of law alone, the judge's  decision
       should be set aside and re-made.  It was argued before me,  however,
       that there was a further error arising from the judge  having  taken
       into account post-application evidence contrary to section 85A(3) of
       the 2002 Act.

   25) This was an issue which was considered  by  a  panel  of  the  Upper
       Tribunal in the case of Ahmed and Another (PBS: admissible evidence)
       [2014] UKUT 00365.  In that appeal the  specific  argument  was  put
       before the Tribunal that  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  was
       divided between non-Points Based matters and Points  Based  matters.
       In assessing whether the business plans were genuine,  the  decision
       maker was refusing the application on grounds which were not related
       to the acquisition of points under the Points  Based  System.   This
       argument was rejected in its entirety  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  for
       reasons set out in its decision.  It was not argued before  me  that
       the decision in Ahmed and Another was wrongly decided and I consider
       that the reasoning in that decision should be followed.  It is clear
       that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal took  into  account  post-
       application  evidence  not  only  in   relation   to   the   funding
       arrangements of the applicant for providing the  required  funds  of
       ï¿½50,000, which was an issue under the Points Based System, but  also
       in relation to the genuineness of  the  claimant's  business  plans.
       This is a further error of law leading to the setting aside  of  the
       decision."


Resumed hearing


8) Notwithstanding these findings  about  the  standard  of  proof  and  the
   taking into account of inadmissible evidence Mr  Coll  nevertheless  took
   the position at the resumed hearing before me that findings  of  fact  in
   favour of the applicant which had been made by Judge Freer should  stand.
   Mr Coll explained that all the documentary evidence was before the First-
   tier Tribunal.  He was not expecting the applicant to  give  evidence  at
   the resumed hearing.  The applicant's wife  was  not  available  to  give
   evidence.  The appeal should be remade on the basis of submissions.

9) Mrs O'Brien pointed out that there were credibility  issues  relating  to
   the evidence for the applicant.  Mr Coll responded that he  had  expected
   the  findings  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  credibility   and
   reliability to be carried forward where there had been no remittal to the
   First-tier Tribunal.  In response it was pointed out that  the  Secretary
   of State's refusal decision raised a number of issues, for example as  to
   the genuineness of the business,  where  the  issue  of  credibility  was
   material.

10) At this point the hearing was adjourned for a short period to  allow  Mr
   Coll to take instructions.  After the adjournment Mr Coll  repeated  that
   he did not intend to lead evidence.  He proposed to make a submission.

11) I then pointed out to  Mr  Coll  that  it  was  not  necessary  for  the
   decision to be re-made before the Upper Tribunal.  As the Upper  Tribunal
   had not yet made a final decision on the appeal, it was  still  open  for
   the appeal to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

12) Mr Coll then began his submission.  I do not propose to record  this  in
   detail.  During the course of his submission, Mr  Coll  referred  to  the
   decision of the Supreme Court in Mandalia [2015] UKSC 59.   He  submitted
   that where there was a gap in the documentary evidence  provided  by  the
   applicant then, in accordance with Mandalia, the missing documents should
   have been requested from the applicant.

13) Mr Coll submitted that the decision of the Secretary of State should  be
   quashed and re-made in favour of the applicant.  It was pointed out  that
   any change to the refusal decision was a  matter  for  the  Secretary  of
   State.  Mrs O'Brien confirmed  this  and  said  that  there  were  policy
   instructions in relation to withdrawals.  At this point Mr Coll indicated
   that remittal to the First-tier Tribunal would in his view be the  proper
   course.

14) In the course of a  brief  submission,  Mrs  O'Brien  pointed  out  that
   Mandalia referred to  the  Secretary  of  State's  policy  on  evidential
   flexibility at a particular time.  The current policy was  now  expressed
   in the Immigration Rules at paragraph 245AA.  She submitted that this was
   not a case which depended upon the submission of a missing document.  The
   case turned on credibility and there were concerns  about  the  evidence.
   She could not see, however, how the case could be decided fairly  at  the
   resumed hearing.

15) Accordingly, as acknowledged by the parties, the  position  was  that  I
   was unable, albeit that I had wished to do so, to re-make the decision in
   the Upper Tribunal.  The  appeal  will  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal for a hearing before a different judge with no findings made  by
   the First-tier Tribunal preserved.  In other words,  the  hearing  before
   the First-tier Tribunal will be  in  effect  a  fresh  hearing  with  the
   credibility of the evidence at issue.

Conclusions

16) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve  the
   making of errors on a point of law.

17) I set aside the decision.

18) I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  for  rehearing  before  a
   judge other than Judge Freer with no findings preserved.

Anonymity

19) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity  order.   I  have  not
   been asked to make such an order and I see no reason of substance for  so
   doing.
