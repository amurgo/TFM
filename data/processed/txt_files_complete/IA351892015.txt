Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Briddock, Counsel, instructed by Visa Legal
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  ("FtT")
    Judge Kainth promulgated on 29th March 2017.  The Judge  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision of  10th  December
    2015 refusing her application for leave to remain  in  the  UK  as  the
    spouse of a British Citizen.


 2. The appellant is a national of  Vietnam.  She  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom on 23rd May 2011 as a Tier 4 student and  subsequently  secured
    extensions of leave to remain until 26th October 2015.   On  17th  June
    2015, her leave to remain  was  curtailed  so  as  to  expire  on  11th
    September 2015.   On 25th August 2015,  she  made  an  application  for
    leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  on  family  and  private  life
    grounds, primarily relying upon her relationship  with  Mr  Vu  Cao  Ly
    Nguyen.   It was the refusal of that application on 10th December  2015
    that gave rise to the appeal before the FtT.


 3.  In  her  decision,  the  respondent  accepted  that  the   suitability
    requirements set out in Appendix FM of the immigration rules are met by
    the appellant.  The application was refused by the  respondent  because
    the appellant failed to provide the  specified  documents  to  evidence
    that she and her spouse had an annual income of �18,600  prior  to  the
    date of her application. The respondent noted in her decision, that the
    appellant had only submitted wage slips for her spouse  for  May,  June
    and July 2015, and bank statements covering the period 2nd  July  until
    31st July 2015.   In her decision, the  respondent  accepted  that  the
    appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  her  partner,
    but considered that  there  are  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    appellant and her partner continuing  their  family  and  private  life
    together, outside the United Kingdom,  in  Vietnam.   Having  concluded
    that the requirements of the immigration  rules  are  not  met  by  the
    appellant, the respondent went on  to  conclude  that  the  appellant's
    application does not raise any  exceptional  circumstances  that  might
    warrant a grant of leave to remain in the UK outside  the  requirements
    of the immigration rules.


 4. In his decision, the FtT Judge noted that the  only  ground  of  appeal
    available to the appellant is whether the decision  is  unlawful  under
    section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1988. The Judge  notes  at  paragraph
    [5] of his decision, that he must consider evidence up to the  date  of
    the hearing. At paragraph [7] of his decision, the Judge  records  that
    he did not hear oral evidence because it was agreed amongst the parties
    that the appeal could proceed on submissions alone.


 5. The Judge then adopted the five-stage approach set out in Razgar.   The
    Judge was satisfied that the appellant enjoys a family  life  with  her
    sponsor and that the decision  to  refuse  leave  to  remain  may  have
    consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of
    Article 8.  The Judge found that because the requirements  of  Appendix
    FM were  not  met  by  the  appellant,  the  respondent  has  acted  in
    accordance with the law.


 6. I pause to note that the appellant accepted that not all  of  specified
    evidence required by Appendix FM-SE of the immigration rules, had  been
    provided at the time of the application. The appellant  contended  that
    an innocent error had been made because the appellant and her  partner,
    were not familiar with the requirements of the rules.   The Judge noted
    at paragraph [15] of his decision that there was in the evidence before
    him, a letter from HMRC that  confirms  that  the  appellant's  sponsor
    earned �25,602 for the year ending 2014, �19,999 for  the  year  ending
    2015 and �22,750 for the year ending 2016.  The Judge  states  "..  the
    requisite  financial  documentation  was  not  provided  as   per   the
    requirements under the rules as at the date of the application.".


 7. Having found that the original decision to refuse the  application  was
    correct and in accordance with the law, the  Judge  considered  whether
    the decision is proportionate  to  the  legitimate  end  sought  to  be
    achieved. The Judge states, at [28], that;


         "..  the  law  requires  me  to  consider  whether   her   personal
         circumstances, which include those of  other  family  members,  are
         enough to outweigh the public  interest  considerations  justifying
         the refusal decision. There is insufficient  evidence  or  argument
         for me to find the appellant's personal circumstances outweigh  the
         public  interest  considerations  that  justify   maintaining   the
         decision. The appellant has relied primarily on a belief  that  her
         application should have been granted under  the  immigration  rules
         because her  sponsor  earnings  were  above  the  required  minimum
         threshold at the time of the application. I  reject  that  argument
         for the reasons which have been enunciated  in  the  body  of  this
         decision."


 8. The Judge concluded that the decision to refuse the appellant leave  to
    remain is proportionate in all the circumstances.


 9. The appellant claims that the Judge erred in a number of respects.  The
    first and second grounds of appeal are linked.   The  appellant  claims
    that it was open to the Judge to consider all of the evidence available
    up to the date of the hearing in accordance with s85A(4)  of  the  2002
    Act.  The Judge erred in finding that the  minimum  income  requirement
    was not met, when the evidence before him, was that the sponsors income
    had exceeded the minimum income  requirement  during  the  three  years
    preceding the application.   The appellant also submits that the  Judge
    erred in  his  assessment  of  the  respondent's  failure  to  exercise
    discretion to request further documentation and in  his  assessment  of
    the public interest considerations and whether the decision  to  refuse
    the application is proportionate to the legitimate  end  sought  to  be
    achieved.  In  amended  grounds  of  appeal,   the  appellants  current
    representatives refer to the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  MM
    (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10, and submit that the Supreme Court confirms at
    paragraph [99] of its decision, that there is nothing  to  prevent  the
    Tribunal on appeal, from looking at  matters more  broadly  by  judging
    for itself, the reliability of any alternative sources  of  finance  in
    the light of the evidence before it.


10. Permission to appeal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chapman
    on 11th October 2017.  She noted:


         "I find arguably material errors of law  in  the  decision  of  FtT
         Judge Kainth, in light of the fact that at the date of the  hearing
         evidence was available to show that the appellant met the financial
         requirements of the rules for the previous three years, [15], which
         was the only reason for refusing the application  to  extend  leave
         and in his assessment of the proportionality  of  the  decision  in
         light of the judgement of the Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon)  [2017]
         UKSC  10,  which  inexplicably  played  no  part  in   the   Judges
         consideration of the appeal"


11. The respondent has filed a rule 24  response  dated  17th  of  November
    2017. The respondent  does  not  oppose  the  appeal  and  invites  the
    Tribunal to determine the appeal with a fresh oral hearing to  consider
    whether the appellant meets the income threshold, although not  meeting
    the specified evidence requirements.


The hearing before me


12. The parties agreed that the only issue in this appeal  is  whether  the
    appellant is able to demonstrate that the minimum income requirement is
    met. If that requirement is met, it is agreed by the parties that  that
    would weigh heavily in favour of the appellant  in  any  assessment  of
    proportionality.


13. Mr Briddock accepts that the relevant specified evidence referred to in
    Appendix FM-SE of  the  rules  was  not  provided  in  support  of  the
    application.  It is accepted that the appellant had failed  to  provide
    the evidence required for the permitted sources of  income.   That  is,
    the required 6 months wages slips with corresponding  bank  statements,
    and  a  letter  from  the  sponsor's  employer   that   satisfies   the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE A1(2)(b).  The rules  require  a  letter
    from the employer who issued the  payslips,  confirming:  the  person's
    employment and gross annual salary; the length of their employment; the
    period over which they have been or  were  paid  the  level  of  salary
    relied upon in the application; and the type of employment  (permanent,
    fixed-term contract or agency).


14. In readiness for the appeal before the FtT, the appellant had  filed  a
    bundle comprising of 29 pages. Mr Briddock refers  to  the  11  months'
    payslips and the corresponding bank statements for the  period  between
    January 2015 and November 2015 that were before the FtT Judge at  pages
    [13] to [25] of the appellant's bundle. There was also evidence  before
    the Judge in the form of a letter from  HMRC  that  confirms  that  the
    appellant's sponsor earned �25,602 for the year  ending  2014,  �19,999
    for the year ending 2015 and �22,750 for  the  year  ending  2016.   Mr
    Briddock submits that the appellant had provided  payslips  covering  a
    period of 6 months prior to the date of  the  application,  albeit  the
    corresponding bank statements for the same period  showed  a  different
    sum credited to the account than stated in the payslips.   Mr  Briddock
    refers to the letter from the employer, Ms Thu  Hanh  Tran  dated  27th
    November 2017 explaining that discrepancy.


15. Ms Trans explains that she  had  set  up  a  standing  order  from  the
    business account for exactly �1,379.82 to be paid  to  the  appellant's
    partner on the same day of every month.  He was given  a  pay  rise  in
    June 2015 and his salary went up to approximately �1,560.71 each month.
     However, she had not changed the standing order until August 2015  and
    so there  remains  a  discrepancy  between  the  income  shown  on  the
    payslips, and the sum paid into the bank account.


16. Mr Briddock submits that the  combination  of  the  evidence  that  was
    before the FtT in the form of payslips, bank statements, and the letter
    from HMRC should have been sufficient to establish that  the  appellant
    is able to meet the minimum income  requirement.   In  any  event,  the
    appellant  has  now  also  provided  her  partner's  payslips  and  the
    corresponding bank statements for the period February 2017  to  October
    2017 that show that the appellant continues to meet the minimum  income
    requirements.  The appellant has also provided a  further  letter  from
    her partner's employer, but Mr  Briddock  accepts,  rightly,  that  the
    further letter from the employer does not confirm the period over which
    the appellant's partner has been or  was  paid,  the  level  of  salary
    relied upon in the application.


17. Mr Briddock submits that even if the specific requirements of the rules
    cannot be met, paragraph GEN.3.2(2) of  Appendix  FM  requires  that  a
    decision maker must consider, on the basis of the information  provided
    by the applicant, whether there  are  exceptional  circumstances  which
    would render refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter or remain, a
    breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because
    such refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  for  the
    applicant, their partner, a relevant child  or  another  family  member
    whose Article 8 rights it is evident from that  information,  would  be
    affected by a decision to refuse the application. He submits  that  the
    evidence establishes that the minimum income requirement  is  met,  and
    that the appellant has waited a considerable period of time for matters
    to be resolved causing her  distress  and  impacting  upon  her  mental
    health.


18. In reply, Mr Jarvis submits that on  any  view  of  the  evidence,  the
    appellant cannot satisfy the requirements  of  the  immigration  rules.
    The immigration rules set out  specific  evidential  requirements  that
    must be met, and they are not met by the appellant.  Mr Jarvis  submits
    that Appendix FM-SE (2)(b) requires that an applicant provides a letter
    from the employer who issued  the  payslips  relied  upon  to  evidence
    salaried employment, confirming specific information.  The letter  from
    the employer that is to be found at page [29] of the appellant's bundle
    before the FtT does not confirm the length of  the  employment  or  the
    type of employment.  Furthermore, the bank statements  relied  upon  do
    not correspond to the payslips and  thus  do  not  establish  that  the
    salary has been paid into an account in the name of the appellant or in
    the name of the appellant and  her  partner  jointly,  as  required  by
    Appendix FM-SE (2)(c) of the rules. He refers to the decisions  of  the
    Court of Appeal in SS (Congo) -v- SSHD [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  and  the
    Supreme Court in Agyarko  -v-  SSHD  [2017]  UKSC  11  to  support  his
    submission that there is no  good  reason  here,  to  depart  from  the
    requirement in the  immigration  rules  that  in  respect  of  salaried
    employment, the specified evidence referred to in Appendix FM-SE  A1(2)
    is required for the permitted source of income relied upon.


DISCUSSION


  19. The only ground of appeal available  to  the  appellant  is  that  the
      respondent's decision is unlawful under s6 of  the  Human  Rights  Act
      1998.  As to the Article 8 claim, the burden  of  proof  is  upon  the
      appellant to show, on the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  she  has
      established a family and private life in the UK, and that her  removal
      from the UK as a result of the respondent's decision, would  interfere
      with that right.  It  is  then  for  the  respondent  to  justify  any
      interference caused. The respondent's decision must be  in  accordance
      with the  law  and  must  be  a  proportionate  response  in  all  the
      circumstances. I can take into account circumstances at  the  date  of
      the appeal hearing before me.


  20. In considering whether the respondent's decision is unlawful under  s6
      of the Human Rights Act 1998 on Article 8 grounds, I have adopted  the
      step by step approach referred to by Lord Bingham in Razgar  -v-  SSHD
      [2004] UKHL 27.


  21. The respondent  accepts  that  the  appellant  is  in  a  genuine  and
      subsisting relationship with her partner, who is  a  British  citizen.
      The Judge of the FtT found, at [8], that the appellant  enjoys  family
      life with her partner.  At [9], the Judge found that the  decision  to
      refuse the appellant leave to remain may  have  consequences  of  such
      gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8.   It  was
      uncontroversial that the  appellant  had  not  provided  the  evidence
      required by the immigration rules in support of  the  application  and
      the Judge of the FtT found, at  [20],  that  the  interference  is  in
      accordance with the law.  The Judge also found that  the  interference
      is necessary to protect the economic well-being of the country.   None
      of those findings is,  rightly  in  my  judgment,  challenged  by  the
      respondent.


  22. The issues in this appeal, as  is  often  the  case,  is  whether  the
      interference is proportionate to the legitimate public end  sought  to
      be achieved.  It is common ground between the  parties  that  although
      the appellant's ability to satisfy the Immigration Rules  is  not  the
      question to be determined by me, it is capable  of  being  a  weighty,
      though not determinative, factor when deciding whether such refusal is
      proportionate to the legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control.


  23. Paragraph E-LTRP.3.1(a)(i) of Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules
      requires that the appellant must provide specified evidence of a gross
      annual income of at least �18,600.  Insofar as is  relevant,  Appendix
      FM-SE A1(2) provides as follows:


         In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where paragraph
         9 applies), all of the following evidence must be provided:


              (a) Payslips covering:


           (i) a period of 6 months prior to the date of application if the
           person has been employed by their current employer for at  least
           6 months (and where paragraph 13(b) of this  Appendix  does  not
           apply); or


           (ii) any period of salaried  employment  in  the  period  of  12
           months prior to the date of application if the person  has  been
           employed by their current employer for less than 6 months (or at
           least 6 months but the person does not rely on  paragraph  13(a)
           of this Appendix), or in the financial year(s) relied upon by  a
           self-employed person.


              (b) A letter from the employer(s) who issued the  payslips  at
      paragraph 2(a) confirming:


           (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;


           (ii) the length of their employment;


           (iii) the period over which they have  been  or  were  paid  the
           level of salary relied upon in the application; and


           (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term  contract  or
           agency).


         (c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period(s) as
         the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the  salary  has  been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the  name  of
         the person and their partner jointly.


         ...


24. The appellant made her  application  on  25th  August  2015.   She  was
    required to provide payslips covering a period of 6 months prior to the
    date of application (i.e. February 2015 to August 2015),  and  personal
    bank statements corresponding to the same period.  For the  relevant  6
    months prior to the application, I now have in the evidence before  me,
    the payslips and bank statements relating to  the  appellant's  partner
    than demonstrates the following:

|Date of      |Amount    |Date of payment |Amount paid into the Bank|
|Payslip      |paid      |into Bank       |Account                  |
|             |          |Account         |                         |
|05.01.15     |�1379.82  |26.01.15        |�1379.82                 |
|05.02.15     |�1379.82  |23.02.15        |�1379.82                 |
|05.03.15     |�1379.82  |30.03.15        |�1379.82                 |
|05.04.15     |�1379.82  |27.04.15        |�1379.82                 |
|05.05.15     |�1390.90  |26.05.15        |�1379.82                 |
|05.06.15     |�1560.71  |29.06.15        |�1379.82                 |
|05.07.15     |�1560.91  |27.07.15        |�1379.82                 |
|05.08.15     |�1560.71  |01.09.15        |�1560.91                 |
|05.09.15     |�1560.71  |28.09.15        |�1560.91                 |
|05.10.15     |�1560.71  |26.10.15        |�1560.91                 |
|05.11.15     |�1560.71  |30.11.15        |�1560.91                 |


25. There is plainly a  discrepancy  between  the  earnings  shown  on  the
    payslips and the sums credited to the bank account for  May,  June  and
    July  2015,  with  smaller  discrepancies  continuing  thereafter.  The
    appellant's partner provides no explanation for that discrepancy in his
    witness statements dated 21st February 2017, and 11th December 2017.  I
    do however have a letter dated 27th November  2017  from  the  employer
    explaining why the pay slips and bank statements do not  match  exactly
    every month.  She states she set up a standing order from the  business
    account for exactly �1,379.82 to be paid into his bank account  on  the
    same day of every month and that the appellant's partner  was  given  a
    pay  rise  starting  from  June  2015  when  his   salary   went   from
    approximately �1,379.82 per  month  to  approximately  �1,567.91.   She
    claims that the June and  July  payslips  showed  the  previous  salary
    because she did not change the standing order until  August  2015.  She
    acknowledges that there is a small difference between what is shown  on
    the payslips and what is paid into the bank account for  the  remaining
    months, and claims it was easier for her to  pay  the  same  amount  in
    every month.  She states that she did not think the  slight  difference
    would really matter too much.


26. As can be seen from the table I have prepared, it is the pay slips that
    are all dated the 5th of each month, not the  payments  into  the  bank
    account. The relevant payment into the bank account,  is  made  on  the
    last Monday of every month.


27. The appellant's case is not assisted by the deficient  letter  provided
    in support of the application by the employer.  Even  now,  the  letter
    from Ms Hannah Tran dated 4th December 2017 simply  confirms  that  the
    appellant's partner started his employment from 5th  April  2012,  that
    his current salary is �23,000  and  his  position  is  permanent.   The
    letter still fails, as Mr Briddock accepts, to set out the period  over
    which the appellant's partner has been or was paid the level of  salary
    relied upon in the application.


28. On any view, the appellant has failed to provide the specified evidence
    of a gross annual income of at least �18,600 as required by Appendix FM-
    SE of the Immigration Rules.   It  follows  that  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules  could  not  be
    met by the appellant.


29. In SS (Congo) -v- SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    considered the proper approach to applications for leave to  enter  the
    UK outside the Immigration  Rules  on  the  basis  of  ECHR  Article  8
    following the Court of Appeal's  decision  in  MM  (Lebanon)  -v-  SSHD
    [2014] EWCA Civ  1985.   In  each  of  the  six  conjoined  cases,  the
    applicants had applied for leave to enter as the  family  member  of  a
    British national or recognised refugee living in the UK. Each had  been
    refused leave because the sponsor's income did  not  meet  the  minimum
    requirements in the Immigration Rules Appendix FM and  Appendix  FM-SE.
    The Entry Clearance Officer rejected  SS's  application  for  leave  to
    enter, on the grounds that her sponsor husband's income was  below  the
    �18,600 required, and  that  documents  submitted  in  support  of  her
    application did not meet the requirements set out  in  Appendix  FM-SE.
    At paragraphs [50] to [53]  of  his  judgment,  Lord  Justice  Richards
    considered the evidential requirements set  out  Appendix  FM-SE  which
    stipulate the form of evidence required to substantiate claims that the
    substantive financial requirements under Appendix FM have been met.  He
    stated:


         "51. In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light of the
         Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as  in  respect  of  the
         substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM. In other  words,  the
         same general position applies, that compelling circumstances  would
         have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or LTR where  the  evidence
         Rules are not complied with.


         52.  This is for two principal reasons. First, the  evidence  rules
         have the same general objective as the substantive rules, namely to
         limit the risk that someone is admitted into the United Kingdom and
         then becomes a burden on public resources,  and  the  Secretary  of
         State has the same primary function in relation to them, to  assess
         the risk and put in place measures which  are  judged  suitable  to
         contain it within acceptable bounds. Similar weight should be given
         to her assessment of what the  public  interest  requires  in  both
         contexts.


         53.  Secondly, enforcement  of  the  evidence  rules  ensures  that
         everyone applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally and  fairly  in
         relation to the evidential requirements they must satisfy. As  well
         as keeping the costs of administration  within  reasonable  bounds,
         application of standard rules is an important means  of  minimising
         the risk of arbitrary differences in  treatment  of  cases  arising
         across the wide range of  officials,  tribunals  and  courts  which
         administer the system of immigration controls. In this regard,  the
         evidence Rules (like the substantive Rules) serve as a safeguard in
         relation to rights of applicants and family members  under  Article
         14 to equal treatment within the scope of Article 8  :  compare  AJ
         (Angola) , above, at [40], and Huang , above, at [16] ("There will,
         in almost any case, be certain general considerations  to  bear  in
         mind: the general administrative  desirability  of  applying  known
         rules if a  system  of  immigration  control  is  to  be  workable,
         predictable, consistent and  fair  as  between  one  applicant  and
         another; the damage to good administration and effective control if
         a system is perceived by applicants internationally  to  be  unduly
         porous, unpredictable or perfunctory; ... the  need  to  discourage
         fraud, deception and deliberate breaches of  the  law;  and  so  on
         ..."). Good  reason  would  need  to  be  shown  why  a  particular
         applicant was entitled to more preferential treatment with  respect
         to evidence than other applicants would expect to receive under the
         Rules. Moreover,  in  relation  to  the  proper  administration  of
         immigration controls, weight should also be given to the  Secretary
         of State's assessment of  the  evidential  requirements  needed  to
         ensure prompt  and  fair  application  of  the  substantive  Rules:
         compare Stec v United Kingdom , cited at para. [15]  above.  Again,
         if an applicant says that they should be  given  more  preferential
         treatment with respect to evidence than the Rules  allow  for,  and
         more individualised consideration of their case, good reason should
         be put forward to justify that."


30. In MM (Lebanon) -v- SSHD [2017] UKSC10, the Supreme  Court  considered,
    inter alia, the validity  of  the  approach  adopted  by  the  SSHD  to
    alternative sources of funding such as third-party support.  The  Court
    held that the SSHD had  adopted  a  stricter  approach  to  alternative
    funding  sources  for  reasons  of  practicality  rather  than  policy,
    reflecting the difficulty of verification of such sources. That was not
    irrational in the common law sense.  However,  operation  of  the  same
    restrictive approach outside the  Rules  was  much  more  difficult  to
    justify under the 1998 Act. It was  inconsistent  with  the  evaluation
    which Article 8 required.  Lady Hale and Lord Carnwath (With Whom  Lord
    Kerr, Lord Wilson, Lord Reed, Lord Hughes and Lord Hodge Agreed) stated




         "76. ... Not everything in the rules need be treated as high policy
         or peculiarly within the province of the Secretary of State, nor as
         necessarily entitled to the same weight. The tribunal  is  entitled
         to see a difference in  principle  between  the  underlying  public
         interest considerations, as set by the Secretary of State with  the
         approval of Parliament, and the working out of that policy  through
         the  detailed  machinery  of  the  rules  and  its  application  to
         individual cases. The former naturally include issues such  as  the
         seriousness  of  levels  of   offending   sufficient   to   require
         deportation in the public interest (Hesham Ali, para  46).  Similar
         considerations would apply to rules  reflecting  the  Secretary  of
         State's assessment of levels of income required to avoid  a  burden
         on public resources, informed as it is by the specialist  expertise
         of the Migration Advisory Committee. By contrast rules  as  to  the
         quality of evidence necessary to satisfy that test in a  particular
         case are, as the committee acknowledged,  matters  of  practicality
         rather than principle; and as such matters on  which  the  tribunal
         may more readily draw on its own experience and expertise.


         99.  ...As has been seen, avoiding a financial burden on the  state
         can be relevant to the fair balance required by  the  article.  But
         that judgment cannot properly be constrained by a rigid restriction
         in the rules. Certainly, nothing that is said in  the  instructions
         to case officers can prevent the tribunal on appeal from looking at
         the matter more broadly. These are not matters of policy  on  which
         special weight has to be accorded to the judgment of the  Secretary
         of State. There is nothing to prevent the tribunal, in the  context
         of the HRA appeal, from judging for itself the reliability  of  any
         alternative sources of finance in the light of the evidence  before
         it.  In  doing  so,  it  will  no  doubt  take  account   of   such
         considerations as those discussed by Lord Brown and  Lord  Kerr  in
         Mahad, including the  difficulties  of  proof  highlighted  in  the
         quotation from Collins  J.  That  being  the  position  before  the
         tribunal, it would make little sense  for  decision-makers  at  the
         earlier stages to be forced to take a narrower approach which  they
         might be unable to defend on appeal.


         100. As already explained, we do not see this as an issue going  to
         the legality of the rules as such. What is necessary  is  that  the
         guidance  to  officers  should   make   clear   that,   where   the
         circumstances give rise to a positive article 8 duty in  the  sense
         explained in Jeunesse,  a  broader  approach  may  be  required  in
         drawing the "fair balance" required by the Strasbourg  court.  They
         are entitled to take account of the  Secretary  of  State's  policy
         objectives, but in judging whether  they  are  met,  they  are  not
         precluded from taking account of other reliable sources of earnings
         or finance. It is open  to  the  Secretary  of  State  to  indicate
         criteria by which reliability of such sources may  be  judged,  but
         not to exclude them altogether."


31. Although the appellant did not  provide  all  the  specified  evidence,
    unusually, I do have in the papers before me, as did the Judge  of  the
    FtT, the letter from HMRC dated 13th October 2016  that  confirms  that
    the appellant's sponsor  earned  �25,602  for  the  year  ending  2014,
    �19,999 for the year ending 2015 and �22,750 for the year ending  2016.




32. In my judgement, there is sufficient evidence before me that points  to
    the appellant's husband earning a sum in excess of �18,600  during  the
    six months prior to the application made by the appellant. In fact,  he
    appears to have earned in excess of �18,600 during the tax years ending
    2014, 2015 and 2016. I acknowledge that there  are  some  discrepancies
    and that it is open to the respondent to set  out  in  the  Immigration
    Rules the criteria by which reliability of  the  income  from  salaried
    employment is to be judged.  Weighing up all the evidence before me and
    having taken into account the discrepancies between  the  payslips  and
    the sums paid into the bank account, and the  explanation  provided  by
    the employer, I am satisfied as to the reliability of the  income  from
    the salaried employment.  I find that the appellant's partner  did,  at
    the material time, and continues  to,  enjoy  a  salary  in  excess  of
    �18,600 from salaried employment that is of a  permanent  nature.   His
    employment has in fact endured for a number  of  years  with  the  same
    employer.


33. The judgments of the Supreme Court in Agyarko -v- SSHD [2017]  UKSC  11
    and in MM (Lebanon) establish that the fact that the  rules  cannot  be
    met, does not absolve decision makers from carrying out a full  merits-
    based assessment outside the rules under Article 8, where the  ultimate
    issue is whether a fair balance has been struck between the  individual
    and public interest, giving due weight to the provisions of the Rules.


34. The Immigration Rules require the appellant to  provide  the  specified
    evidence of a gross annual income of at  least  �18,600.    The  appeal
    before me is on human rights grounds and in my judgment,  although  the
    appellant is unable to meet the requirements of the  immigration  rules
    because the specified evidence has not been provided, the fact that the
    minimum income requirement is satisfied, is  a  relevant  consideration
    when taking account of the public interest.  As Lord  Justice  Richards
    noted in SS (Congo), and the Supreme Court noted in MM  (Lebanon),  the
    evidence rules have the  same  general  objective  as  the  substantive
    rules, namely to limit the risk  that  someone  is  admitted  into  the
    United Kingdom and then becomes a burden on public resources.  There is
    no doubt that avoiding a financial burden on the state is  relevant  to
    the fair balance required by Article 8.


35. I remind myself that section 117A of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002  requires  that  in  considering  the  public  interest
    question, I must (in particular)  have  regard  to  the  considerations
    listed  in  section  117B.   I  acknowledge  that  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration controls  is  in  the  public  interest.  On  the
    evidence before me, and in light of my findings, I  am  satisfied  that
    the appellant will not place a financial burden on  the  state.  In  my
    judgment, the appellant is able to meet the  substantive  part  of  the
    rules, but was unable to satisfy the procedural part of  the  rules  in
    Appendix FM-SE.  The appellant  has  remained  in  the  UK  throughout,
    lawfully.  The family life between the appellant and  her  partner  was
    not formed at a time when the  appellant  was  in  the  UK  unlawfully,
    albeit that the appellant only had temporary leave to remain.


36. Having carefully considered the evidence before me and taking  all  the
    relevant factors into account including those in S117B of the 2002 Act,
    I am satisfied, on the facts here, that  the  decision  to  remove  the
    appellant is disproportionate to  the  legitimate  aim  of  immigration
    control. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the  decision  to  remove
    the appellant would be in breach of article 8.


37.  It follows that I set aside the decision of  the  FtT  Judge  and  the
    appeal is allowed on Article 8 grounds.


Notice of Decision


38. The decision of the FtT Judge involved the making of an  error  of  law
    such that it is set aside.


39. I re-make the decision and allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.


40. No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT


FEE AWARD


Although I have allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds, I decline  to  make
a fee award in favour of the appellant.  The appeal has been  allowed  based
on the evidence before me, that was not before the respondent  at  the  time
of the decision appealed.
