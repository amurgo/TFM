                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly.  This order  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.   Any
failure to comply with this order could  give  rise  to  contempt  of  court
proceedings.


 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chana  dismissing   his   appeal   against   the
    respondent's decision to make a deportation  order  against  him  as  a
    foreign criminal pursuant to sections 32, with reference to section 33,
    of the UK Borders Act 2007.  It is the appellant's case that he  is  at
    risk of treatment contrary to  the  Refugee  Convention,  alternatively
    that he is entitled to humanitarian protection or that he is at risk of
    treatment contrary to Articles 3 and 8 ECHR.

 2. The index offence relied upon  is  the  appellant's  conviction  on  16
    October 2015 for being engaged in production of  cannabis,  a  Class  B
    controlled drug. He was sentenced to 2 years 6 months imprisonment  for
    that offence.

 3. It is accepted by the respondent, following a decision by the Competent
    Authority on 20 September 2016 (page 74  in  the  appellant's  bundle),
    that the appellant is a trafficked person and victim of modern slavery.
     In addition, the appellant produced a rule 35 report  dated  15  March
    2017 from Dr I Sayed at Harmondsworth Detention Centre, indicating that
    scars and injuries on the appellant's body may be due  to  his  claimed
    history of being repeatedly beaten by his employer in Vietnam.

 4. The appellant also relied on a medico-legal report on  the  appellant's
    psychological difficulties, prepared by Dr Brock Chisholm  BSc  (Hons),
    MSc,  DClinPsych,  CPsychol,  AFBPsS.   Dr  Chisholm   identifies   his
    specialist field as 'mental  health  difficulties  following  traumatic
    events, asylum seeker and refugee mental health'.  Dr Chisholm had  not
    seen any medical records for the appellant.  Dr Chisholm did  not  find
    that the appellant met the criteria for any  mental  health  diagnosis,
    though he was clearly anxious and did not feel that he had yet  escaped
    his traffickers.  His wife and child were at risk if he did not pay the
    debt they said he owed for bringing him to  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    appellant did not have PTSD, nor, despite a low and anxious  mood,  did
    he meet the criteria for major depressive disorder.  The appellant  was
    not suicidal, but was coping poorly with  detention  and  might  become
    mentally ill should it continue.

 5. There was also a country report from Dr Thi Lan Anh Tran, LLB, LLM, PhD
    in International Law.  His main  area  of  research  was  international
    human rights law in  socialist  political  country  systems,  including
    China, Vietnam, Cuba and North Korea.   He visits Vietnam annually  for
    research, teaching  and  consultancy.   Before  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom for his PhD and Masters' thesis, the witness worked from  1997-
    2013 as a senior official of the Vietnam Government.  Dr Tran's opinion
    was  that  the  appellant  would  face   significant   challenges   and
    difficulties on return to Vietnam:  the appellant lacked  the  relevant
    ID documents and would have to re-register, as his registration in  his
    residence district would have lapsed.  When  he  re-registered  for  H�
    Kh�u, either in his home area or an  area  of  relocation,  his  former
    trafficker would be able to locate him.

 6. There were a huge number of trafficking victims in Vietnam and  despite
    preventative efforts from the government,  international  organisations
    and NGOs, the numbers were continuing to increase.  Dr Tran  considered
    that any legal protection was more apparent than  real:   in  practice,
    the support system for human trafficking victims in  Vietnam  was  very
    weak.  He considered that there was a high risk of the appellant  being
    re-trafficked if returned to Vietnam.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana noted that the sole issue for  her  was
    the risk to this appellant on return to Vietnam.  She  found  that  the
    appellant was not a credible witness and that 'it is clear to  me  that
    he came to this country voluntarily and he was not trafficked into  the
    United Kingdom'.  The Judge appears to  have  relied  on  an  erroneous
    summary in the respondent's bundle, which suggests that the applicant's
    claim to have been trafficked was rejected  by  the  National  Referral
    Mechanism, with only his modern slavery (forced labour) claim accepted.
      The  Judge  did  not  invite  submissions  before  going  behind  the
    respondent's concession that she would not seek to reopen  the  finding
    of the Competent Authority that the appellant had been trafficked.

 8. The Judge noted the evidence in the rule 35 report but  discounted  it,
    on the basis that the injuries described could have other  causes.   At
    [62], having found the appellant not to be  trafficked,  she  dismissed
    the  report  of  Dr  Tran  as  based  on  the  appellant's  account  of
    trafficking, which she rejected.  She placed no weight on the  expert's
    evidence  about  the  lack  of  effective  protection  for  victims  of
    trafficking on return to Vietnam at [10.2] in Dr Tran's report:

         "10.2         In my professional opinion, the Applicant would  face
         many significant challenges and difficulties if he is  returned  to
         Vietnam.   He  does  not  have  any  ID  paper  including  a  birth
         certificate or national ID card.  He would also need to re-register
         his 'H� Kh�u'.  Without those ID papers, he is almost considered as
         an 'illegal migrant' in Vietnam.  In order to survive, he might  be
         forced to do exploitative work to support him.   In  addition,  the
         Applicant is at high risk of being the target of human  traffickers
         as he is in a vulnerable state and has no protection  available  to
         him from family or relatives.  The risk to the Applicant  would  be
         the same in every part of Vietnam.  In order to be able to live  in
         Vietnam he needs the H�  Kh�u'  Re-registration.   Consequently  he
         would have the risk of  coming  to  the  attention  of  his  former
         trafficker/loan shark (          ) if he is  returned  to  Vietnam.
         So, I believe that the Applicant's fear of  the  enormous  risk  of
         being returned to Vietnam is fully justified."

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal cannot stand.  I hereby set  it
    aside and substitute a decision allowing the appeal.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
