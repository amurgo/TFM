          DECISION AND REASONS FOR FINDING A MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW

Introduction

1.   The appellant before this Tribunal is the Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department who I will refer to as "the Secretary of  State".   The
    respondent to this appeal is Mrs Prabha Verma, who was the appellant in
    the Tribunal below.  I will refer to her as "the appellant".

2.   The appellant is a citizen of India and she  was  born  on  5  February
    1939.  She arrived in the UK on 10 September 2013 under a  visit  visa.
    She subsequently applied to vary her  leave  but  the  application  was
    refused on 9 April 2014.  The Secretary of State set  out  her  reasons
    for the refusal in a letter dated 9 April 2014.

3.   The appellant appealed the refusal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT)
    when her appeal was heard at Nottingham on 11 August 2014 before First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Atkinson (the Immigration Judge).  The  Immigration
    Judge decided on the evidence given to allow the appeal "under  Article
    8 of the Human Rights Convention".  The Immigration Judge dismissed the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.  No anonymity order was made but he
    did make a fee award in the sum of ï¿½140.

4.   The Secretary of State appealed  that  decision  by  notice  of  appeal
    dated 28 August 2014.

5.   The judge who granted permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Denson  thought  that  compelling
    circumstances had  to  be  shown  before  the  appellant's  application
    outside the Immigration Rules under Article 8 could  be  allowed.   The
    Immigration Judge had not made adequate findings so as to identify such
    compelling circumstances so as to justify a finding that the  appellant
    was entitled to  remain  in  the  UK  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Accordingly, Mr Denson gave permission to appeal.

6.   Standard directions were sent out informing the  parties  that  no  new
    evidence would be heard by the Upper Tribunal unless an application was
    made setting out why the evidence had not been obtained before the FtT.



7.   The appellant provided  a  response  under  Rule  24  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  The  Rule  24  response  by  Ms
    Sood, on behalf of the appellant, states that the decision of  the  FtT
    was one open to it having regard to recent case  and  statute  law  and
    more than borne out by the evidence.  The decision was a  proportionate
    one in all the circumstances and the Upper Tribunal should uphold it.

The Hearing

8.    At  the  hearing,  which  lasted  approximately  one  hour,  I   heard
    submissions by both representatives.  The appellant did not  give  oral
    evidence.  Ms Johnstone argued that there was public and private social
    care provision in India, that the appellant had  family  there,  albeit
    they may be unwilling to help, and it is clear from  the  refusal  that
    the Secretary of State's view was that the appellant  could  return  to
    India.  Before the Immigration Judge decided to go outside the Rules he
    ought to have regard  first  to  the  provisions  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") and in  particular  to
    those provisions inserted by the Immigration  Act  2014  at  part  V(A)
    ("the 2014 Act").  There were  public  interest  considerations  to  be
    taken into account in all cases by virtue of s. 117B of  the  2002  Act
    and particular requirements to be met to  ensure  that  applicants  for
    leave to remain were  financially  independent  and  not  a  burden  on
    taxpayers.  The Immigration Judge had not  taken  these  factors  fully
    into account.  I was also  referred  to  Dube  [2015]  UKUT  90  (IAC),
    decided since the 2014 Act came into force.  In that case it  was  held
    that the new provisions were additional considerations  which  did  not
    constitute a radical departure  from  the  previous  case  law.   There
    continued to be a requirement for a structured approach  in  line  with
    the leading case of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  However, it was an error of
    law not to refer to 117A-D.

9.   It was submitted that the Immigration Judge's reasoning was flawed.   I
    was referred in particular to paragraph 37 of the determination of  the
    FtT.  There, the Immigration Judge suggests that  the  appellant  would
    be:

         "Socially  isolated  and  could  not  rely  on  the  practical  and
         immediate  support  of  family  members.   The  appellant  requires
         support in undertaking and completely (sic) everyday living  tasks.
         I accept the view that there is limited  provision  of  public  and
         private social care in India, where there is  an  expectation  that
         such matters are  the  responsibility  of  the  family.   In  those
         circumstances, the appellant is likely to be at  risk  of  neglect;
         her physical (sic) would deteriorate from lack of  compliance  with
         prescribed medication and inadequate nutrition ..."

10.  Ms Johnstone  therefore  submitted  that  even  the  Immigration  Judge
    appeared  to  accept  that  the  appellant  could  return   to   India.
    Furthermore, if the judge wanted to go  outside  the  Rules  he  should
    first  of  all  consider  the  requirements  of  Section   117A.    The
    Immigration  Judge  had  already  found  (at  paragraph  27)  that  the
    appellant had  a  good  understanding  of  English  by  virtue  of  her
    university education.  He went on to assume that the appellant would be
    treated outside the NHS but, it was submitted,  there  were  no  proper
    grounds  for  concluding  that  the  appellant  would  be  "financially
    independent", nor could it be guaranteed that the appellant  would  not
    resort to the NHS in old age (she is presently 76).

11.  By reply Ms Sood submitted that there  was  a  great  deal  of  medical
    evidence before the Tribunal or the FtT (for example  she  referred  to
    page 29  of  the  appellant's  bundle).   It  was  submitted  that  the
    appellant suffered from a degree of  dementia  and  her  removal  could
    worsten this condition.  The Immigration Judge made clear  findings  at
    paragraph 11 of his determination.  Paragraph 11 of  the  determination
    showed that the Immigration Judge was persuaded that the appellant  had
    a degree of Alzheimer's  disease  and  that  she  was  unable  to  give
    evidence and the sponsor gave evidence instead.  The appellant had  not
    "deliberately  evaded  the  Rules"  but  her  Alzheimer's  disease  had
    overtaken her.  It had not been diagnosed until the appellant came into
    the UK.  There were relatives in India but they would  provide  limited
    support.   In  particular  there  was  an  elder  sister.   Given   the
    appellant's deterioration in her cognitive state the Immigration  Judge
    was justified in making the finding he had in relation to family  life.
    There was a social care report as well.  The appellant was "mobile" but
    "needs resources".  There was evidence that she would not depend on the
    NHS.

12.  In reply the respondent pointed to the  requirements  for  bringing  an
    elderly relative into the UK which are contained in Appendix FM  at  E-
    ECDR (Phelan at page  1169).   It  was  pointed  out  that  there  were
    financial requirements that must be met under  E-ECDR  (Phelan  p1170).
    Suitable undertakings were required before an  application  under  this
    Rule could have succeeded, for example, accommodation and  care  for  a
    period of five years must be available before ILR will be granted.

13.  At this point Ms Sood pointed  out  that  her  client's  case  was  not
    solely based on her medical condition but wider considerations applied.



14.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision as to whether  or  not
    there was a material error of law in the decision of the FtT.

Conclusions

15.  The Immigration Judge made reference to Sections  117A-D  of  the  2002
    Act,  quoting  the  legislation  at  length  in  paragraph  10  of  his
    determination.  According to  Section  117B,  certain  public  interest
    considerations apply in all cases.  These include:

    (1)  the interests of the wellbeing of  the  United  Kingdom  being  to
         admit persons who are less of a burden on taxpayers; and

    (2)  the fact that those who are  financially  independent  are  better
         able to integrate into society.

16.  The Immigration Judge also referred to the requirements  introduced  by
    the legislative changes  in  the  2014  Act  at  paragraph  27  of  his
    determination.  However, it was insufficient for the Immigration  Judge
    to refer to those requirements.  It was necessary for him  to  consider
    those requirements as against the facts of the case before  him  before
    departing from the  Immigration  Rules  and  making  a  "free-standing"
    assessment under Article 8.  Although the leading cases  relied  on  by
    the Secretary of State of Nagre and Gulshan must now be  considered  in
    the light of later authorities, as well as the legislation to  which  I
    have referred, it is nevertheless appropriate to consider whether there
    are compelling  circumstances  preventing  the  appellant's  return  to
    India.  It is  necessary  to  ask  whether  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to remove is in all the circumstances unreasonable or  whether
    it leads to an unjustifiably harsh outcome.  The Immigration Rules  are
    intended to be a complete code and they should be  departed  from  only
    where the circumstances justify that departure.

17.  I am not satisfied that the Immigration Judge kept fully  in  mind  the
    requirements of the Rules and the requirements of  Sections  117A-D  of
    the 2002 Act.  If the appellant met the requirements of the Rules based
    on the financial means of the sponsor and her husband,  why  could  she
    not apply under those Rules?  The fact that her daughter and son-in-law
    can buy the appellant private medical treatment does not mean that they
    will or that this is a proper basis for finding that her  human  rights
    would be infringed.  The Immigration Judge's  conclusion  that  because
    her English family had money she would not become a burden to taxpayers
    and ultimately use  the  NHS  was  not  one  reasonably  open  to  him.
    Generally, a person's human rights are not enhanced by  the  fact  that
    she does not, or does not intend to, claim public funds to which she is
    entitled.

18.  As the respondent submitted, the UK  is  the  not  the  world's  health
    service  provider  and  the  appellant's  circumstances  are   not   so
    compelling that she could not return to India, a country where she  has
    lived all her life up to 2013, where she owns property  and  where  she
    has a large number of relatives.  I find that the Immigration Judge did
    not adequately consider the presence  of  relatives  in  India  and  in
    particular a sibling, the appellant's  husband's  family  and  her  two
    daughters.  There is also the possibility of paid health care, which is
    expressly referred to in Dr Junaid's report.  Indeed,  the  appellant's
    circumstances may be better in India, with her strong  family  network,
    than in the UK where she is more likely to become  dependent  upon  the
    state.

19.  The Immigration Judge was entitled to find that the appellant  suffered
    from moderate Alzheimer's  disease.   It  is  not  established  by  the
    medical  evidence  when  the  appellant  first  suffered  an  onset  of
    Alzheimer's disease. However, it is clear that she will be able to cope
    with this condition with suitable carers and paid help.  India has  its
    own system of health care.  Although this may not be  as  sophisticated
    as an advanced western economy it is not for the Secretary of State  to
    protect the health of foreign nationals.  There is no general right  to
    good health and no general right to choose the country one lives in for
    the purposes of availing oneself of the health system there.

20.  There is no Article 3  claim  here.   The  medical  evidence  does  not
    indicate that  the  appellant  is  incapable  of  flying  or  that  her
    Alzheimer's disease has deteriorated to such an extent  that  she  will
    suffer serious harm if she returns to India.  Indeed, I find, there  is
    no basis for concluding that it would be disproportionate  in  all  the
    circumstances for her to  return  to  her  own  country.   The  medical
    evidence does not support the conclusion that the appellant will suffer
    some irreparable harm which prevents  her  removal  from  the  UK.   It
    merely suggests that certain aspects of her health have improved  since
    she came here.

21.  I consider in all the circumstances  that  the  decision  was  one  the
    Immigration Judge was not reasonably entitled to come to. His  decision
    was not merely a generous one. He  had  an  inadequate  regard  to  the
    provisions of the Immigration Rules and the  2014  Immigration  Act  in
    reaching his conclusion.  Simply by referring to  the  provisions  does
    not mean he has properly analysed them. The facts of this case,  in  my
    judgment, do not support the conclusion that the  respondent  would  be
    acting in a disproportionate manner by removing the appellant.

Notice of Decision

22.  I find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  a
    material error of law such that it requires to be set aside.

23.  I substitute the decision of the Upper Tribunal which is to  allow  the
    Secretary of State's appeal.  Accordingly,  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to refuse the appellant leave to remain and  issue  directions
    for the appellant's removal stands.
