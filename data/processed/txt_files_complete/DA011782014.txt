                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008


Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo born  on
    17th September 1976 and now aged 40 years old.  She arrived in  the  UK
    in June 1991 at the age of 14 years old and in June 1992  was  included
    in an asylum claim as a dependent.  On 11th March 1999 she was  granted
    indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK (Exceptionally Outside the  Rules)
    under special measures used to clear a backlog of claims.

 2. On 19th June 2008 she was convicted of three  counts  of  making  false
    representations and making an article for use in fraud  for  which  she
    was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.  On 4th November 2008 she was
    served  with  a  Liability  to  Automatic  Deportation  letter  and   a
    Deportation Order was signed against her on 19th  December  2008.   Her
    appeal against that decision was dismissed on 20th April 2009  and  she
    became appeal rights exhausted on 28th April 2009.  She claimed  asylum
    on 23rd July 2009.  She gave birth to a daughter on 10th June 2011.

 3. No decision was made on the claim until 5th June 2014 nearly five years
    after  the  asylum  interview.   The  appellant  appealed  the  refusal
    decision made on 5th June 2014 and which is  the  decision  subject  to
    challenge in these proceedings.

 4. The Secretary of State informed the  appellant  that  she  intended  to
    exclude her from Refugee Convention protection but in the event, at her
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal,  on  12th  December  2014,  the
    appellant confined her appeal to Article 8 grounds  alone.   First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Metzer  QC  allowed  the  appellant's  appeal  but  that
    decision was challenged by the Secretary of State to the Upper Tribunal
    which, found that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had 'simply  failed  to
    have any regard to the relevant Immigration  Rules  and  the  statutory
    scheme, in his consideration of the appeal'.

 5. The matter was remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal  and  heard  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Davey who also allowed the appeal on  Article
    8 grounds.  Once again the Secretary of State challenged  the  decision
    on the basis that the Judge had made a material misdirection in law and
    ignored the relevant  Immigration  Rules  regarding  deportation.   The
    question was not in relation to the concession or otherwise in relation
    to Article 8 which the Secretary of State accepted  would  be  engaged.
    The question which needed to be addressed was whether there  were  very
    compelling circumstances which outweighed  the  public  interest.   The
    First-tier Tribunal Judge did not engage with the Immigration Rules  or
    engage with the statutory scheme correctly.

 6. Furthermore, the Secretary of State asserted, that the Upper  Tribunal,
    having set aside First-tier Tribunal Judge Metzer's decision,  had  not
    preserved any of the findings  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Metzer.
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Davey had however, and despite the  direction
    of the Upper Tribunal, relied on those findings.  The  judge  had  also
    erred in his proportionality assessment and cherry picked  the  Section
    117 findings.  The child was not a qualifying  child  and  it  was  not
    entirely clear from [7] of his decision what the  needs  of  the  child
    were and whether they amounted to very compelling circumstances.

 7. On 7th November 2016 I found that there was a material error of law  in
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Davey.  There appeared to  be
    no reference to the Immigration Rules in relation to deportation and  I
    did not accept that the provisions regarding deportation in Section 117
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  merely  mirrored
    those in the Immigration Rules.  The Immigration Rules  were  mandatory
    and the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 identified
    that the Rules are a complete code and that it is necessary to apply  a
    structured approach under the Rules rather than  merely  completing  an
    Article 8 assessment outside the Rules.

 8. This is the third time that this matter has been  considered.   At  the
    hearing before me MO gave evidence and confirmed  that  since  she  had
    come to the UK she had resided  nowhere  else.   She  stated  that  her
    grandmother lived in the UK and she had no-one in the DRC, no  savings,
    and did not know how  she  would  manage  if  she  returned.   She  was
    supported financially by the care allowance for her daughter  and  some
    income  support  in  the  sums  of  �62  per  week  and  �36  per  week
    respectively.  She stated she had borrowed some money from her  friends
    to fund the legal fees and that she had a partner who  lived  in  Paris
    who was an artist and gave her approximately �200 every  three  months.
    She could not identify any particular internet research to support  her
    contention that it would be difficult for her child  to  be  cared  and
    educated for in the DRC.  Her daughter was on five to  six  sachets  of
    Movical because of her chronic constipation  and  she  had  a  scan  in
    November 2016 which possibly suggested surgery.

 9. Mr Whitwell made submissions that  the  appellant,  at  the  most,  had
    lawful residence in the UK between 1991 and 2008, and  that  meant  she
    only had seventeen years of  lawful  residence  since  the  deportation
    order served in 2008 would have removed any right to remain in the  UK.
    The  appellant  accepted  she  could  speak  French  and  Linguala  and
    Congolese.  Mr Whitwell submitted that the primary facts  were  not  in
    dispute and there needed to be a holistic assessment of  the  case  set
    against the background of the  Rules.   The  appellant  was  a  foreign
    criminal within  the  meaning  of  Section  117D  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum  Act  and  although  ostensibly  in  the  middle
    category, such that of  paragraph  398(b)  might  apply  there  was  no
    qualifying child because S was born on  10th  June  2011  and  had  not
    remained in the UK for seven years and the appellant herself  had  only
    been lawfully present in the UK for a maximum of seventeen years, which
    was not more than half  her  life.   He  also  disputed  that  she  was
    socially and culturally integrated, bearing in mind her criminal record
    of deception and  fraud,  or  that  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to her integration into  the  country  to  which  she  should
    return.  She had no issues with the  language,  she  was  of  Christian
    religion and the documents referred to the daughter enjoying  Congolese
    music.  This was not a child who  was  dislocated  from  the  Congolese
    culture.   Furthermore,  the  appellant  still  socialised   with   the
    Congolese diaspora.  Her finances may be precarious but  she  did  have
    family members in the UK and cousins and a degree of financial  support
    which could continue until she had successfully established herself  in
    the DRC.  So far  she  had  been  successfully  supported  in  the  UK,
    including her borrowing from friends.

10. Mr Whitwell also submitted that  the  appellant  had  spent  the  first
    fourteen years of her life in the Congo and bearing in  mind  the  case
    law of  Azimi-Moayed  (decisions  affecting  children  onward  appeals)
    [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC), the seven years from the age of 7  onwards  were
    very important and indicated the formative years would be  particularly
    important.  She would be returned with her daughter and it was  in  the
    best interests of the child to remain with the mother.

11. Mr Whitwell submitted that the Education Health and Social Care plan in
    connection with the child's special educational needs  and  the  letter
    from the Royal Free were a contrast to the oral evidence and had a more
    balanced approach.  The child was essentially physically  healthy.   He
    submitted that there were no very significant obstacles to  her  return
    and clearly no very compelling circumstances either.

12. Mr Bobb submitted that the appellant had been in the UK for  25  years,
    although he accepted that she had not lived here  lawfully  from  2008.
    The criminality would have an impact on her integration and  each  case
    should be fact-specific, but it should  be  noted  that  she  had  been
    convicted and served one year in prison.  She did not fall at the  high
    end of offending.  He submitted that there would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to her reintegration into the DRC where she  had  only  spent
    fourteen years of her life and had no friends.   Any  ability  for  the
    appellant to find employment would be in the context of having to  care
    for her daughter who was obviously  demanding.   To  suggest  that  her
    partner and people who were funding her in the  UK  would  continue  to
    support her when she was many miles  away  was  not  realistic  and  to
    suggest long-term financial support was available went too far.   There
    should also be consideration of the grandmother with whom the appellant
    lived and for whom she cared.

13. The condition of the child should  be  taken  into  account.   She  had
    faecal impact which was a very severe condition and the mother suffered
    from anxiety.  The daughter had soiling and toileting difficulties  and
    was likely to need a high level of support.  The child  had  a  current
    network of professional support and provision which would not  continue
    on her relocation to the DRC.  The child would have an  extremely  poor
    quality of life.  It should be  noted  that  the  daughter  still  wore
    nappies at the age of 5 and had been identified as a child in  need  on
    the various care plans.  Those care plans, although not suggesting that
    the mother was 'bad mother' had, because  of  the  stress  and  anxiety
    since 2008 on the mother, recorded that the child needed a watchful eye
    and there were very compelling circumstances which should outweigh  the
    strong public interest in returning the appellant to the DRC.

Conclusions

14. The Court of Appeal has stressed the force of the  public  interest  in
    the deportation of foreign criminals (SSHD v AJ  Zimbabwe  [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 1012) and that Tribunals  will  be  in  error  if  they  apply  the
    principles without recognising that the UK has chosen to  put  a  heavy
    premium on the removal of foreign criminals.  It is also axiomatic that
    the Immigration Rules are applied when considering  Article  8  in  the
    light of foreign criminals and their deportation. Although the decision
    letter was signed in June 2014, in relation  to  deportation,  a  claim
    with respect to Article 8 will only succeed where the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules as at 28th July 2014 are met  (see  A362  and  YM
    Uganda [2014] EWCA civ 1292).

15. I note that the appellant was convicted in 2008 for a  serious  offence
    and the sentencing judge referred to it as "a sophisticated fraud  over
    a very long period of time".  She received  a  total  sentence  of  two
    years' imprisonment.  It would appear  that  the  appellant  has  other
    convictions of a less serious nature and although they did not  feature
    in the representations made on behalf of the  respondent,  I  refer  to
    those below. I also note that there was an earlier decision in relation
    to the appellant's Article 8 claim which was  dismissed  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Hollingworth in 2009.  The circumstances  are,  however,
    very different and the law has altered not least in  the  form  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

16. The Immigration Rules reflect the position of the Secretary of State in
    relation to Article 8 and are said to be a complete code.  I  set  them
    out as follows to demonstrate that the approach further to SS  Congo  v
    SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 317 has been adopted.

         "398.    Where a person claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
                contrary to the UK's obligations  under  Article  8  of  the
                Human Rights Convention, and

              (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to
                    the public good and in the public interest because  they
                    have been convicted of an offence for  which  they  have
                    been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4
                    years;

              (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to
                    the public good and in the public interest because  they
                    have been convicted of an offence for  which  they  have
                    been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less  than
                    4 years but at least 12 months; or

              (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to
                    the public good and in the public interest  because,  in
                    the view of the Secretary of State, their offending  has
                    caused serious harm or they are  a  persistent  offender
                    who shows  a  particular  disregard  for  the  law,  the
                    Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider
                    whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does
                    not, the public interest in  deportation  will  only  be
                    outweighed  by  other  factors  where  there  are   very
                    compelling circumstances over and above those  described
                    in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
                if -

               (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                    relationship with a child under the age of 18 years  who
                    is in the UK, and

                    (i)    the child is a British Citizen; or

                    (ii)   the child has lived in the UK continuously for at
                        least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of
                        the immigration decision; and in either case

                        (a)    it would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to
                             live in the country to which the person  is  to
                             be deported; and

                        (b)    it would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to
                             remain in the UK without the person who  is  to
                             be deported; or

                (b)    the person has a genuine and subsisting  relationship
                    with a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen
                    or settled in the UK, and

                    (i)    the relationship was formed at a  time  when  the
                        person (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and  their
                        immigration status was not precarious; and

                    (ii)   it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live
                        in the  country  to  which  the  person  is  to  be
                        deported, because of compelling circumstances  over
                        and above those described  in  paragraph  EX.2.  of
                        Appendix FM; and

                    (iii)  it would be unduly  harsh  for  that  partner  to
                        remain in the UK without the person who  is  to  be
                        deported.

         399A.    This paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
                applies if -

                (a)    the person has been lawfully resident in the  UK  for
                    most of his life; and

                (b)    he is socially and culturally integrated in  the  UK;
                    and

                (c)    there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
                    integration into the country to which it is proposed  he
                    is deported."

17. I am satisfied that first I must apply the  relevant  principles  under
    paragraph 399 and note that there is no qualifying child as S, born  in
    2011 has not lived continuously in the UK for  at  least  seven  years.
    The appellant's partner is someone who lives in Paris and is neither  a
    British citizen nor settled in the UK.  In any event, it  would  appear
    that that partnership was formed at a time when her immigration  status
    was precarious.

18. The appellant has not lived lawfully in the UK for most of her life and
    cannot comply with paragraph 399A(a).  The Deportation Order was signed
    on 4th November 2008 and the appellant was  said  to  have  entered  in
    1991.  The period 1991 to 2008  equates  to  seventeen  years  and  the
    appellant is now 40 years old, and has lived in the United Kingdom  for
    nearly 26 years, but the 'clock' would be stopped  by  the  Deportation
    Order and for the purposes of the Immigration Rules  I  am  considering
    the matter as at the date of  the  hearing.  There  was  debate  as  to
    whether the appellant was socially and  culturally  integrated  in  the
    United Kingdom, bearing in mind her convictions, and Mr  Whitwell  made
    the point that she had lived her formative life up until the age of  14
    abroad.  She was introduced to the  UK  as  a  minor  and  subsequently
    offended.  Even so, bearing in mind that the appellant had not lived in
    the UK for most of her life, I am not  persuaded  that  paragraph  399A
    applies.  Paragraph 399A(c) is conjunctive  and  the  appellant  cannot
    meet the first two requirements.

19. It is therefore necessary to consider whether there  are  indeed  "very
    compelling circumstances" over and above those described in  paragraphs
    399 and 399A (although those factors can be considered when  addressing
    whether there are very compelling circumstances).

20. I place emphasis on the strength of the  public  interest  in  removing
    foreign criminals and note that the recorder at the Crown Court in June
    2008 referred to her, the appellant, as having a "dreadful  record  for
    conducting her life in  a  dishonest  way".   The  appellant  had  been
    convicted under her own and her alias name for a  variety  of  offences
    relating to fraud and theft and she served a sentence of  four  months'
    at a young offender's institution in 2000. She absconded for  a  period
    of two years leading to another custodial sentence in 2006 for  failing
    to surrender to bail and was again sentenced  to  imprisonment  of  120
    days (plus a 20 days consecutive sentence) for  obtaining  property  by
    deception in 2008.  She was sentenced for the  index  offence  in  June
    2008

21. I turn to  consideration  of  the  best  interests  of  the  child.  BL
    (Jamaica) v SSHD  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  357  emphasises  that  the  public
    interest will be greater the more serious the offence and I  take  into
    account  the  conviction  of  the  appellant,  the  sentence  and   the
    sentencing  remarks.   I  also  take  heed  that  the  children's  best
    interests have to be weighed  against  other  relevant  considerations.
    There needs to be an explanation  of  why  any  child's  interests  are
    strong enough to displace the public interest in deportation.  Clearly,
    first and foremost the best interests of the child at her young age  of
    5 are to remain with  her  mother.  This  is  a  child  with  Congolese
    nationality and who has no leave to remain.  The grandmother has  leave
    to remain but only  limited  information  was  put  before  me  to  the
    connection between the child and the grandmother although as they  live
    together it would be common sense to deduce a connection between  them.
    The question I do ask in  relation  to  the  child  is  are  there  any
    exceptional circumstances or rather compelling circumstances  over  and
    above the matters considered?

22. It is clear from the final Education, Health and Social Care plan dated
    27th October 2016 recorded that the  daughter  experiences  speech  and
    language difficulties and is settled in a maintained mainstream school.
     The report also states she "suffers with  constipation  and  this  has
    made it difficult for her to learn toileting.  She experiences pain and
    anxiety around this".  The education plan confirms  that  she  presents
    with severe receptive language difficulties at the  0.1st  centile  and
    that she has  significant  difficulties  in  the  way  she  understands
    language.  She is however able to  communicate  using  one-two  keyword
    phrases and with non-verbal communication skills.   She  also  presents
    with severe expressive language skills.  When assessed her  performance
    fell within the 0.1st percentile which is in a very low range  and  she
    needs to develop her abilities to communicate occurring incidents.  She
    clearly has difficulty in interacting with her peers and her ability to
    make and sustain friendships.  The EHSC plan also identified  that  she
    presented with  significant  cognitive  difficulties  and  was  working
    significantly below expected targets in  literacy;  in  the  non-verbal
    reasoning ability her score fell  within  the  5th  centile  which  was
    within the low range for her age.  She is, however, described as  being
    cheerful and sociable.  The report also referred  to  her  longstanding
    physical difficulties with toileting.  It is clear that she has a  wide
    range  of  professional  support  and  benefits  from  a  language  and
    communication programme at her school, which  is  speech  and  language
    therapist led.  Specifically the health provision identified  that  the
    daughter's "health  and  care  needs  will  require  monitoring  and  a
    collaborative  multi-agency  approach'  to  'ensure  that  there  is  a
    consistent understanding and approach to provision within this area  of
    need", referring to toileting.

23. I also took into account the letter from the Royal Free dated 1st  June
    2016 relating to the daughter which identified  a  variety  of  medical
    issues including a large abdominal mass  secondary  to  severe  chronic
    constipation,  significant  soiling  difficulties   due   to   overflow
    diarrhoea, primary nocturnal enuresis and learning needs.  The  current
    professional network supporting the child included the Integrated  Care
    Support Team, School Nurse,  Speech  and  Language  Therapist,  Special
    Educational Needs Co-Ordinator,  Social  Worker,  Community  Paediatric
    Nurse, Continence Nurse and pending referral to  CAMHS  MOSAIC  (mental
    health services).

24. The report from Dr Allison Maud, Consultant  Paediatrician,  dated  1st
    June 2016 identified that the daughter "was also noted to have a 'child
    in need' plan secondary to maternal mental health issues  and  concerns
    regarding previous substance misuse" ...  "More  recently,  involvement
    from the Children's Integrated Care Support Team and the School Nursing
    Service  have  highlighted  significant  ongoing   concerns   regarding
    soiling".

25. This letter also recorded professional concerns raised and recorded

         "'information obtained from review of electronic health records, e-
         mail  correspondence  and  direct  conversation.  There  have  been
         ongoing  concerns  regarding  S's  mother's  poor  engagement  with
         services and failure to comply with medical  recommendations  (such
         as constipation medications and attendance for an eye test).  S  is
         already on a child  in  need  plan  due  to  pre-existing  concerns
         regarding mother's ability to meet  her  health  and  developmental
         needs.  It is important to note that mother is  the  primary  carer
         for a sick and elderly grandparent and is also currently undergoing
         a very stressful immigration assessment process as an asylum seeker
         from the Congo."

26. That is not exactly correct as it is clear that the mother is  in  fact
    fighting deportation proceedings, but nonetheless  I  accept  that  the
    daughter has significant special  educational  needs  and  also  health
    problems.  In addition it would appear without further information that
    the mother is caring for a sick and elderly grandparent.

27. The appellant has a history of mental health difficulties.  The  report
    from Camden Family Services dated 18th March  2016  repeats  a  history
    from the appellant concerning her earlier life in  the  Congo  and  the
    particulars which had led to her having anxiety  and  depression  which
    has continued for a period of time. There was a  further  letter  dated
    16th  September  2016  from  Dr  Soad  Nasr,   Clinical   Psychologist,
    identifying that the appellant's current mental health problems are  an
    expression of the persistent stress she had been  subjected  to  during
    the last six  years  of  her  life  due  to  the  "pervasive  sense  of
    uncertainty, deprivation of liberty and  disempowerment  that  she  has
    been subjected to".   That said, the decision of the appellant to fight
    the proceedings is  her  decision  but  there  is  no  doubt  that  the
    appellant had to wait for five years in relation to a decision  on  her
    asylum, which was ultimately rejected.  With respect to the appellant's
    mental health difficulties I have regard  to  the  essential  principle
    that the ECHR does not impose any obligation on the contracting  states
    to provide those liable to deportation with medical  treatment  lacking
    in their 'home countries' MM Zimbabwe v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 279 but it
    is the impact that her mental health will have on the care of the child
    of which I am mindful and it has was  documented  in  the  papers  that
    there are concerns  regarding  the  appellant's  ability  to  meet  her
    child's health and developmental needs.

28. When considering very compelling circumstances I have considered all of
    the relevant factors in line with AJ and under  NA  (Pakistan)  v  SSHD
    [2016] EWCA Civ 662.   The question I posed is whether there  are  very
    compelling circumstances  which  required  the  strong  presumption  in
    favour of deportation of a foreign criminal such as the appellant to be
    overridden?  I have had  regard  to  Section  117  of  the  Nationality
    Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  overall  which  stresses  that  the
    deportation of foreign criminal is in the public interest and the  more
    serious the offence the greater is the public interest in  deportation.
    The appellant was brought to the UK as a young person in  1991  at  the
    age of 14 years old and included in an asylum claim as a dependent. She
    had lawful leave to remain from March 1999 in the  form  of  Indefinite
    Leave to Remain but any lawful leave expired in 2008 on the  making  of
    the Deportation Order when her ILR would have been  revoked.   She  can
    speak English but is financially dependent and has had a child  in  the
    United Kingdom whilst her leave is precarious.  That cannot be  visited
    on the child.  The  appellant  does  not  fall  within  the  exceptions
    described in Section 117C (4) or (5) and further to  Section  117C  (6)
    there must be 'very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those
    described in Exceptions 1 and 2'.   Even though the Exceptions are  not
    fulfilled under Section 117  it is nonetheless possible  to  show  that
    'very compelling circumstances' exist which would make it unduly  harsh
    and hence disproportionate and contrary to Article 8 for the  appellant
    to be deported NA (Pakistan).

29. The decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Hollingworth  in  2009  had
    regard to the OASys report which referred to the risk of  serious  harm
    on release of the appellant from prison was low but  the  risk  of  re-
    offending was  medium.  The  Tribunal  also  identified  that  she  had
    received other custodial sentences and her behaviour described at  that
    time as anti-social. There was, however, no evidence that she  had  re-
    offended since her release. Since that time she has moved in  with  her
    grandmother and had a child.  Despite the fact that the judge  made  no
    order fro  deportation  in  2008  the  appellant  was  subject  to  the
    automatic deportation provisions.

30. It is clear that the best interests of the child are to remain with her
    mother, but in relation to her physical and educational health would be
    best served in remaining in  the  United  Kingdom  where  it  has  been
    recommended as a child in need that she  should  experience  consistent
    care.  I am  aware  that  the  best  interests  of  the  child  do  not
    necessarily outweigh the public interest which is strong in the case of
    removing  foreign  criminals,  but  it  is  not  so  much  the   health
    difficulties and  the  educational  difficulties  of  the  child  which
    constitute  very   compelling   circumstances,   but   the   cumulative
    circumstances in which the mother will find herself on removal  to  the
    DRC should she be removed with her child and the effect on the child.

31. As I state, the best interests of this child are  to  remain  with  her
    mother and she will be returned to the DRC with her  mother  presenting
    with the level of educational  and  health  difficulties  that  I  have
    described  above.   The  appellant  cannot  succeed  on  the  basis  of
    paragraph 399 or Section 117 (as noted above) as there is no qualifying
    child but I consider the child's needs to be considerably in excess  of
    most children in a mainstream school and this is  demonstrated  by  the
    EHSC plan and the medical evidence.

32.  Although  the  appellant  does  retain  contact  with  the   Congolese
    community, I am not persuaded that her financial support,  particularly
    from  her  artist  boyfriend  who   lives   remotely   in   Paris   and
    intermittently sends her money, and an elderly  sick  grandmother,  can
    support her whilst she attempts to establish or  continue  to  maintain
    herself in the DRC.

33. The grandmother is 83 years old with osteoarthritis and glaucoma  (from
    the medical records) and needs a  French  or  Linguala  interpreter  in
    order  to  communicate  with  medical  professionals.  The   Consultant
    Paediatrician Dr Ward referred in her letter of 19th May  2016  to  the
    appellant as caring for her sick and elderly grandmother. The appellant
    lives with her grandmother in the UK for  whom  it  is  stated  in  the
    witness  statements  that  she  cares  for  on  a  daily  basis.    The
    grandmother did not attend court nor give evidence as to her dependence
    on her.  I note that  there  is  a  decision  from  Judge  Hollingworth
    referring to the fact that the  family  life  could  be  maintained  by
    telephone calls, letters and similar in the event of removal, but  that
    decision was made as long ago as 2009, some seven  years  ago.   I  can
    accept that it would  be  a  wrench  for  the  elderly  grandmother  to
    experience the removal of the daughter,  but  that  in  itself  is  not
    compelling.  The  relationship  between  the  child   and   the   great
    grandmother  was  described  by  the  child's  social  worker  as  warm
    nurturing and secure.  This would also have a detrimental effect on the
    best interests of a young and  vulnerable  child  and  elderly  parent.
    Overall this does not  suggest  to  me  that  the  grandmother  of  the
    appellant would be of much assistance in supporting  her  granddaughter
    and on whom she is herself reliant should the appellant be deported.  I
    find that it is most unlikely she would  be  able  to  remit  financial
    support to her daughter.

34. The mother would be coping with a child with specific health  and  care
    needs, described as profound  by  the  Special  Educational  Needs  Co-
    ordinator of her primary school, whilst at the same  time  experiencing
    mental health difficulties, which  are  documented  in  the  papers  by
    professionals.  I am not persuaded therefore that she would be able, at
    the same time as caring for a young vulnerable  five  year  old  child,
    owing to the child's care and supervision needs, be able  to  work  and
    support both herself and her child.

35. I am not persuaded that the  appellant  would  have  long-term  support
    financially on removal, or indeed that she would have accommodation  in
    the DRC, and I find that her ability to secure employment would  indeed
    be hampered by her child's learning difficulties.  There is no evidence
    that she has any relatives in the DRC and  although  cross  examination
    disclosed that she  is  a  member  of  a  church  with  some  Congolese
    congregation  I  am  not  persuaded  that  this  would  translate  into
    effective support in the DRC.  The Refusal to  revoke  the  deportation
    order letter from the Secretary of State referred to the fact that  the
    appellant had never lived in the DRC as she fled from Zaire  and  there
    to Belgium a former colonial power.  She  had  always  lived  with  her
    grandmother.  In all the circumstances for the child are likely  to  be
    unduly harsh.

36. The appellant would appear to have committed no  offences  since  2008,
    some eight years ago. In all these circumstances I do consider these to
    be very compelling circumstances over  and  above  those  described  in
    paragraph 399 and 399A which I have explored, and I therefore allow the
    appeal, notwithstanding the emphasis that I have placed on  the  public
    interest in removing foreign criminals.

37. I therefore allow the appeal of MO.
