Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Ms E Martin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 5 April 1990.  He  arrived
   in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2010 with entry clearance conferring
   leave to enter until 17 May 2012. On 17 May 2012 he applied for leave  to
   remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

2. The  appellant's  application  was  refused  on  11  January  2013  under
   paragraphs 322(1A)  and  245ZX(a)  of  the  immigration  rules,  both  in
   relation to the evidence produced as  to  funds  available  to  meet  the
   maintenance requirements. The respondent considered  that  the  documents
   produced by the appellant in that regard, namely bank  statements  and  a
   letter from Metropolitan Bank Limited, were false documents, as confirmed
   in a document verification report.

3.  The  appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  and  his  appeal  was
   determined on the papers on 9 May 2013 by the First-tier Tribunal.  In  a
   determination promulgated on 17 May 2013, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Aziz
   dismissed the appeal, referring to the document verification  report  and
   finding on the basis of  that  report  that  the  Metropolitan  Bank  Ltd
   documents were false and  that  the  respondent  had  therefore  properly
   refused the application under paragraph 322(1A).

4. The appellant applied for permission to appeal against that  decision  on
   the basis that  his  bundle  of  evidence,  which  he  had  submitted  in
   accordance with the Tribunal's directions, had not been considered by the
   First-tier Tribunal.

5. Permission to appeal was granted on 7 June 2013.

Appeal hearing and submissions

6. Neither the  appellant  nor  his  representatives  were  present  at  the
   hearing. I noted the written request for the appeal to be  determined  on
   the papers owing to the appellant's inability to attend following a  road
   accident which had resulted in restricted mobility.

7. I advised Ms  Martin  that  the  chronology  of  events  leading  to  the
   determination of the appeal suggested that there had  been  a  procedural
   error on the part of the Tribunal, since the appellant had  been  advised
   in a form IA35 that he had until 15 May 2013 to submit all his  evidence,
   but his appeal was determined on 9 May 2013. His appeal bundle was  faxed
   to the Tribunal on 15 May 2013, after the appeal had been considered.  On
   that basis Ms Martin accepted that the decision should be set  aside  and
   re-made and she went on to make submissions before me.

8. She submitted that the appellant had produced no evidence to support  the
   claim made at paragraph 10 of his grounds of appeal before the First-tier
   Tribunal as to his bank's confirmation  that  they  had  not  denied  the
   genuineness of his bank statement. The respondent had never been provided
   with the appellant's explanation  for  the  false  documents,  since  his
   statement and accompanying  evidence  had  been  submitted  only  to  the
   Tribunal for a papers determination. The  national  savings  account  and
   certificates had never been submitted to the respondent for verification.
   The only documents provided to the respondent had been verified as false.
   It was not  credible  that  the  appellant  would  have  signed  a  blank
   application form, as he now claimed. There was no evidence to confirm his
   account of having sought legal advice against Mr Yaqoob, whom he  claimed
   to have been responsible for the false documents. By his own admission he
   did not have sufficient funds to meet the requirement of  the  rules,  as
   can be seen from  the  Lloyds  TSB  and  Barclays  bank  statements.  The
   appellant had not provided a proper reason for not wishing to  attend  an
   oral hearing as the medical evidence did not confirm his claimed lack  of
   mobility. The decision to refuse to vary leave did not breach  Article  8
   of the ECHR as it was  not  unreasonable  to  expect  him  to  return  to
   Pakistan. The appeal ought to be dismissed.

Consideration and findings

9. As stated above, it seems that the Tribunal made a  procedural  error  by
   determining the appeal before the deadline given  to  the  appellant  for
   filing his evidence,  resulting  in  the  bundle  of  evidence  filed  in
   accordance with directions not having been  taken  into  account  in  the
   decision. As such, the Tribunal's decision has to be set  aside  and  re-
   made.

10. In re-making the decision I have had full regard to  the  appeal  bundle
   submitted by the appellant. Within that bundle is a statement in which he
   sought to explain the false bank statements. He did  not  deny  that  the
   documents were false, but he stated that he had nothing to do with  their
   submission and that he had not been involved in the deception. He claimed
   to have loaned a sum of �2,950 to a Mr Yaqoob on 11 June 2012 and to have
   contacted him for the return of the funds when he received a request from
   the UKBA in August 2012 to make a new application within  60  days,  with
   evidence of funds. Mr Yaqoob was reluctant to repay the loan but  finally
   agreed for his close friend in Pakistan to deposit an equivalent  sum  in
   Pakistan rupees in his overseas account. Mr Yaqoob then took him  to  his
   friend Mr Rao, an immigration advisor, who told him  that  his  agent  in
   Pakistan would obtain his bank statement once Mr Yaqoob had deposited the
   amount in his overseas account and would then make  his  application  for
   leave to remain on  his  behalf.  Mr  Rao  asked  him  to  sign  a  blank
   application form, which he did, and he provided him with his  Lloyds  TSB
   and Barclays account statements,  and  he  was  later  advised  that  his
   application had been submitted. When his application was refused and  the
   question of deception raised, he contacted Mr Rao, but  was  subsequently
   unable to get hold of either Mr Yaqoob or Mr Rao.  He  had  sought  legal
   advice against both but was advised that  he  could  do  nothing  without
   their addresses or dates of birth, which he did not have.

11.  I  do  not  accept  that  explanation.  It  is  not  supported  by  any
   independent evidence and is completely inconsistent with the evidence  in
   the  grounds  of  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Whilst  the
   appellant  now  denies  having  submitted  the   application   form   and
   accompanying documents himself, it was previously his case, as set out in
   the grounds of appeal at paragraphs  9  to  11,  that  he  had  submitted
   genuine bank statements with his application and that  he  had  contacted
   his bank who had denied receiving any enquiry from the UKBA. He  has  not
   provided any evidence from his bank to confirm that explanation and it is
   notable that no bank  statements  for  his  overseas  account  have  been
   produced.

12. Furthermore, with regard to the explanation now given by the  appellant,
   I note that the Lloyds TSB and Barclays bank statements produced  in  the
   appeal bundle do not show any withdrawal of funds to the sum of �2,950 in
   the days preceding 11 June 2012 and neither is  there  evidence  of  such
   withdrawals from any overseas accounts. His claim to have signed a  blank
   application form is lacking in all credibility and  neither  he  nor  his
   witness Mr Ahmed sought to attend an oral hearing to  give  evidence  and
   face cross-examination. For the appellant it is claimed that his injuries
   from a road traffic accident have left him with limited mobility, but the
   medical evidence does  not  confirm  that  to  be  the  case.  There  is,
   furthermore, no evidence to confirm the appellant's claim to have  sought
   legal advice about Mr Yaqoob and Mr Rao. The entire account is plainly  a
   fabrication and I have no doubt that the  appellant  willingly  exercised
   deception in submitting false documents with his application.  I  do  not
   place any weight upon the national savings certificates and account.

13. In any event, it is clear from the guidance in AA (Nigeria) v  Secretary
   of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 773  that  deception  is
   not a necessary requirement for a mandatory refusal in  cases  of  forged
   documentation (paragraph 67):

   "It is highly likely therefore  that  where  an  applicant  uses  in  all
   innocence a false document for the purpose of obtaining entry  clearance,
   or leave to enter or to remain, it is because some other party, it  might
   be a parent, or sponsor, or agent, has dishonestly promoted  the  use  of
   that document. The response of a  requirement  of  mandatory  refusal  is
   entirely understandable in  such  a  situation.  The  mere  fact  that  a
   dishonest document has been used for such  an  important  application  is
   understandably a sufficient reason for a mandatory refusal. That  is  why
   the rule expressly emphasises that it applies  "whether  or  not  to  the
   applicant's knowledge"."

14.  As  such,  I  consider  that  the  respondent  properly   refused   the
   appellant's application under paragraph 322(1A) and  that  the  appellant
   was accordingly unable to meet the requirements of paragraph 245ZX(a)  of
   the rules.

15. With regard to Article 8 of the ECHR, there is no  suggestion  that  the
   appellant has established a family life in the United Kingdom. Whilst  he
   may well have established a private life here, given his two and  a  half
   year period of residence, I do not consider that  any  interference  with
   that private life would be disproportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of
   maintaining an effective immigration control. There  is  no  evidence  of
   studies or other activities undertaken here  and  any  private  life  the
   appellant has established is clearly  limited.  He  has  submitted  false
   documents and used deception in so doing and in denying having  done  so.
   There is no reason why he  cannot  return  to  Pakistan  and  resume  his
   private life there. His removal as  a  consequence  of  the  respondent's
   refusal to vary his leave is clearly not in breach of Article 8.

DECISION

16. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
   making of an error on a point of law. The decision has been set aside.  I
   re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on all grounds.

                               Signed                                  Date
