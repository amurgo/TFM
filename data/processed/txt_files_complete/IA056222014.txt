Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr. S. Harding of Counsel instructed by  Baron  Grey,
                       Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr. M. Shalliday, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Steer promulgated on 30 July 2014, dismissing the  Appellant's  appeal
      against a decision dated 16 January 2014 to remove him from the UK.


Background

   2. The Appellant is a national of Jamaica  born  on  8  August  1979.  He
      entered the UK on 17 December 2001 with limited leave for  six  months
      as a visitor. The Appellant overstayed. He took no steps to regularise
      his immigration status until he  made  an  application  for  leave  to
      remain on 8 November 2011, relying upon Article 8  of  the  ECHR  with
      reference to his relationship with Ms Zoreena Sacha Hines,  a  British
      citizen, with whom he lived,  together  with  their  son  Kymani  Paul
      Sanchez (d.o.b. 6 January 2010). Whilst  the  Appellant's  application
      was pending he and Ms Hines had a further son, Jayden  George  Sanchez
      (d.o.b. 1 November 2012). Both of the Appellant's children are British
      citizens.


   3. The application was initially refused on 7  December  2012  without  a
      right of appeal. However, subsequent to the commencement  of  judicial
      review  proceedings  the   Respondent   agreed   to   reconsider   the
      application.


   4. In due course the Respondent again refused the Appellant's application
      for reasons set out in a 'reasons for refusal' letter  ('RFRL')  dated
      16 January 2014, and on the same date made the consequent decision  to
      remove the Appellant.


   5. The Appellant appealed to  the  IAC.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      dismissed the appeal for reasons set out in her determination.


   6. The Judge decided that the Appellant did not meet the requirements  of
      the Immigration Rules - in particular paragraphs 276  ADE,  353B,  and
      the rules in respect of leave to remain as a  partner,  and  leave  to
      remain as a parent, under Appendix FM - and also concluded that  there
      were  no  exceptional  circumstances  that  warranted   a   favourable
      consideration under Article 8 of the ECHR. However,  she  did  make  a
      number  of  favourable  findings  in  respect  of  the  fact  of   the
      Appellant's relationship with his partner and children, concluding: "I
      find that the Appellant has been  living  permanently  with  Ms  Hines
      since they moved to 69 Burns Avenue in 2009, and that they remain in a
      genuine and subsisting relationship" (paragraph 18).  The  Judge  also
      identified that insofar as paragraph EX.1 might be  applicable,  there
      would be no financial requirement for the Appellant to  satisfy  under
      the Rules (paragraph 19).


   7. Otherwise, the Judge concluded that "there were no  "non-standard  and
      particular features" demonstrating that removal would be unjustifiably
      harsh", noting in particular that the Appellant "spent  the  first  22
      years of his life in Jamaica... has supported himself  in  the  UK  by
      cooking so could continue that occupation in Jamaica...  has  maternal
      cousins living  in  Jamaica  who  could  assist  with  his  settlement
      there... [and has] failed to provide  any  country  evidence  that  he
      would be unable to find employment or accommodation in  Jamaica".  The
      Judge also observed in respect of Ms Hines,  "His  partner  has  never
      visited Jamaica, but her mother was born there". (See paragraph 21.)


   8. In respect of the Appellant's children and section 55 of the  Borders,
      Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, the Judge stated:

"In relation to section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act
      2009, both the Appellant's children are British. They are aged 4 years
      old and 14 months old, respectively. They could remain living  in  the
      UK with their British citizen mother. Alternatively, I have found that
      there are no insurmountable obstacles to them  relocating  to  Jamaica
      with both their parents."


   9. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  which
      was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy on 10 October 2014.


Error of Law

  10. There was some discussion during the hearing as to the construction of
      paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM,  and  its  interrelationship  with  the
      various 'routes' under Appendix FM - in particular the 'partner route'
      (section R-LTRP)  and  the  'parent  route'  (section  R-LTRPT)  which
      potentially apply in this case.  Mr  Shalliday  took  instructions  to
      clarify the Respondent's position. He then accepted on behalf  of  the
      Respondent that there had been a material error of law in the  Judge's
      approach to the Appellant's case under paragraph EX.1.


  11. Section EX of Appendix FM is headed  'Exception'.  Paragraph  EX.1  in
      fact contains two exceptions: EX.1.(a) in respect of situations  where
      the applicant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with
      a child falling within a specified category; and  EX.1.(b)  where  the
      applicant has a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  a  partner
      falling within a specified category. There is nothing in  the  wording
      of EX.1 or otherwise in the construction of Appendix FM which suggests
      that the 'parent exception' can only apply in cases where the  'parent
      route' is being considered, or that the 'partner exception'  can  only
      apply in cases where the 'partner route' is being considered. It is on
      this point that Mr Shalliday took express instructions.  He  confirmed
      that it was the Respondent's position that either  of  the  exceptions
      could avail an applicant, whatever the route by  which  the  applicant
      reached section EX.1. In our judgement  this  concession  is  properly
      made. We do not consider that there is anything  in  the  drafting  of
      Appendix FM that suggests any alternative construction.


  12. The tests under EX.1.(a) and EX.1.(b) are different. In respect of the
      'parent exception' the test is whether "it would not be reasonable  to
      expect the child to leave the UK" (EX.1.(a)(ii)); in  respect  of  the
      partner exception  the  test  is  whether  "there  are  insurmountable
      obstacles to family life with the partner continuing outside  the  UK"
      (EX.1.(b)).


  13. At paragraph 20 of her determination  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      quoting from Gulshan [2013] UKTV 00640 (IAC) recognised that there was
      a qualitative difference in these tests - "It  [-  the  insurmountable
      obstacle test -]  is  said  to  be  a  different  and  more  stringent
      assessment than  whether  it  would  be  "reasonable  to  expect"  the
      applicant's partner to join them overseas... [A] significant degree of
      hardship  or  inconvenience  does  not  amount  to  an  insurmountable
      obstacle".


  14. However, paragraphs 20 and 24 of the  determination  demonstrate  that
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not  have  regard  to  EX.1(a),  and
      otherwise only considered the  children's  position  by  reference  to
      'insurmountable obstacles'. The Judge  did  not  consider  whether  it
      would be 'reasonable to expect' the children  to  leave  the  UK.  The
      context was that the Judge, was satisfied that it was  appropriate  to
      consider EX.1 because the Appellant otherwise met the requirements  of
      the partner route. The Judge's error was thereafter to focus  only  on
      the  'partner  exception'  and  not  also  to  evaluate  the   'parent
      exception', by  reference  to  the  reasonableness  of  expecting  the
      children to leave the UK.


  15. As noted above, Mr Shalliday realistically conceded that this amounted
      to a material error of law.


  16. We pause to note that had it been necessary we would have been  minded
      to conclude that the Judge had conducted an inadequate  assessment  of
      the children's best interests. Although she referred to section 55  at
      paragraph 24 of the determination, all that then follows is some short
      observation as to the age of the children and the possibility of their
      remaining in the UK notwithstanding the removal of  their  father,  or
      relocating with their mother  to  Jamaica.  There  is  no  attempt  to
      evaluate or otherwise make any finding in respect  of  whether  either
      such arrangement would be in the children's best  interests,  compared
      with, for example, remaining in the UK  with  both  their  father  and
      their mother.


  17. Be that as it may, in light of the Respondent's concession in  respect
      of paragraph EX.1, we find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in
      law by not properly directing himself in accordance  with  the  Rules.
      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside accordingly.


Re-making the Decision

  18. Neither representative considered it was necessary for the Tribunal to
      hear any further evidence in the appeal,  or  for  the  appeal  to  be
      remitted to the First-tier Tribunal. We  endorse  that  approach.  The
      findings of fact in respect of the Appellant's  relationship  with  Ms
      Hines and their cohabitation since 2009 were not challenged.  They are
      an agreed premise for the further consideration of this appeal.


  19. Mr Shalliday invited the Tribunal to conclude that the decision of the
      Respondent  had  not  been  in  accordance  with  the  law  and   that
      accordingly the Tribunal should in effect  remit  the  matter  to  the
      Respondent to determine the outstanding application in accordance with
      the law. Mr Harding invited  the  Tribunal  to  determine  the  appeal
      substantively under the Rules.


  20. On the basis of the unchallenged findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge - and save in one regard which we address below - there  is  now
      no controversy that the Appellant is able  to  'reach'  EX.1  via  the
      partner route: R-LTRP.1.1.(d). Mr Shalliday did not dispute  that  the
      Appellant met the eligibility requirements at E-LTRP.1.2-1.12 and 2.1.
      It  was  also  accepted  that  the  Appellant  met   the   suitability
      requirements,  save  with  the  possible  exception  of  S-LTR.1.6  by
      reference to the fact that he had been convicted on 15 October 2010 of
      possession of a Class  A  drug  and  fined  �250.  Mr  Shalliday  also
      conceded that it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  children  to
      quit the UK.


  21. Mr Shalliday argued that the discretion under S-LTR.1.6, had not  been
      considered by the Respondent, and in such a circumstance it should not
      be exercised for the first time by the Tribunal: see Ukus (discretion:
      when reviewable) [2012] UKUT 307.


  22. We note from the RFRL dated 16  January  2014  that  the  Respondent's
      decision-maker clearly had it in mind  that  the  Appellant  had  been
      convicted of a criminal offence on 15 October 2010.  It  is  expressly
      referred to at the foot of the first page of the RFRL.


  23. It is also to be noted that when setting out consideration under  both
      the 'partner route' and the 'parent route' the Respondent referred  to
      the suitability requirements stating, respectively: "It is  considered
      that your application will not fall for refusal under the  suitability
      requirements of Appendix FM", and "Your case will not fall for refusal
      under suitability requirements of Appendix FM".


  24. We add, parenthetically, that it seems to us no  very  great  surprise
      that the Respondent would not  have  concluded  that  the  Appellant's
      offending, which was the subject way of a �250 fine, over three  years
      before the decision, did not indicate in short, that  the  Appellant's
      presence in the UK was not conducive to the public  good.  Of  greater
      significance, however, in the context of the arguments before  us,  is
      that in, our judgement, Mr Shalliday's submission (that the Respondent
      has not given consideration to this matter) is  unsustainable.  It  is
      clear that the decision-maker had regard to the Appellant's  offending
      and found it did not justify defeating his application; regard was had
      to the 'suitability requirements', necessarily including S-LTR.1.6. It
      is also apparent that 'suitability' was not an issue  relied  upon  by
      the Respondent before the First-tier Tribunal.


  25. Accordingly, we find that the Appellant has demonstrated on a  balance
      of probabilities that he meets the requirements of each of  R-LTRP.1.1
      (a), (b) and (d). In respect of RLTRP.1.1.(d), and for  the  avoidance
      of any doubt, we accept the decision-maker's initial  concession  that
      the Appellant's  application  did  not  fall  for  refusal  under  the
      suitability requirements as properly made;  the  Appellant  meets  the
      applicable eligibility requirements (as was the finding iof the First-
      tier Tribunal);  and  paragraph  EX.1.(a)  is  satisfied  (as  is  now
      conceded by Mr Shalliday).


  26. In this latter respect, and generally, for the avoidance of any  doubt
      we have had regard to section 55 of the 2009 Act. We consider that the
      best interests of the children are served by remaining  with  both  of
      their parents in the UK. We recognise, however, that 'best  interests'
      is only a starting point for any consideration under either the  Rules
      or Article 8 of the ECHR.


  27. Again for the avoidance of any doubt, we have noted the provisions  of
      sections 117A-D of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as
      amended by the Immigration Act 2014. Because we have found  that  this
      appeal is to be allowed under  the  Immigration  Rules,  we  have  not
      embarked on a relevant assessment pursuant to 117A(1). So the  various
      public interest considerations there specified do not apply directly -
      although we recognise that to a very large extent they  have  informed
      the balance that Appendix FM seeks to strike.


  28. In conclusion, the Respondent's decision was not  in  accordance  with
      the Immigration Rules. The Appellant met the requirements of  Appendix
      FM, section R-LTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), and further leave  to  remain
      should have been granted pursuant to D-LTRP.1.2 accordingly.


Notice of Decision

  29. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  involved  a  material
      error of law and is set aside.


  30. We re-make the decision in the appeal. The appeal is allowed under the
      Immigration Rules.
