                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Kelly and Mrs Hussain JP who allowed the claimant's appeal against  the
    decision of 28th November 2013 to deport him from the UK.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Afghanistan.  He arrived in the UK on 21st
    January 2002 and claimed asylum, was refused but granted twelve  months
    exceptional leave to remain. He applied for  further  leave  to  remain
    which was refused on 23rd February 2004.  He subsequently made  an  out
    of time application for leave to remain as the unmarried partner  of  a
    British citizen which was refused on 18th February 2005 with  no  right
    of appeal.  He returned to Afghanistan on 14th February  2006  and  was
    granted entry clearance to come to the UK as  a  fiancï¿½  on  9th  March
    2006.  He married L  M  on  22nd  September  2006  and  they  have  two
    children.

 3. The claimant has committed two offences of sexual assault, one  upon  a
    minor  on 13th August 2005 and the second on an adult on 24th  December
    2006.  On 8th February 2008 he was sentenced to a total  of  22  months
    imprisonment.  A deportation decision was made on  5th  September  2008
    and his subsequent appeal against that decision was  dismissed  on  8th
    December 2009.   The claimant appealed to the Court of  Appeal  and  on
    17th March 2011 the  Secretary  of  State  undertook  to  withdraw  her
    decision and to reconsider the Article 8 claim in the light of  current
    circumstances.

 4. The claimant was released on immigration bail in around March 2009  and
    he was not allowed contact with his children for a period of about  six
    months thereafter.  His contact with the family was  phased  until  May
    2011 when he was finally permitted to return to the  family  home  with
    unrestricted and unsupervised access to his children.

 5. The judge set out the circumstances of  both  offences  and  noted  the
    remarks of the sentencing judge and the OASys Report. The  panel  found
    the claimant's wife to be a truthful witness and  noted  that  she  had
    significant medical problems, as do the two children.

 6. It was conceded that it would be unreasonable to expect the children to
    leave the UK and, as it would appear that  their  mother  is  the  only
    family member who would potentially be available to provide  them  with
    care,  there  must  necessarily  be  insurmountable  obstacles  to  her
    settling with her husband in Afghanistan.

 7. The judge was however satisfied that she would be able, in spite of her
    medical problems, to provide an adequate level of daily care  for  them
    in the claimant's absence.

 8. The judge recorded that it was significant that some  seven  years  and
    four months have now elapsed since  the  claimant  committed  his  most
    recent offence, and he had been at liberty for all  save  for  thirteen
    months of that period.  This was not, however, a factor  which  appears
    to have been considered by the person who made the current decision  to
    deport.  When invited to address the issue the Presenting Officer urged
    that it did not outweigh the public interest in deporting the claimant.







 9. The judge wrote as follows:

         "The time that has elapsed since the offences and the good  use  to
         which the Appellant has put it serves both  to  diminish  the  risk
         that he continues to pose to the  general  public  and  reduce  the
         overall proportionality of deportation in furtherance of the public
         interest in preventing crime.  We have however also had  regard  to
         the inevitable public revulsion at offences of the  time  committed
         by this Appellant; a revulsion which we fully share. We  have  also
         taken account of the fact that the deportation of foreign criminals
         serves to deter other foreign nationals who aspire to settle in the
         UK, from following their example.  Indeed it is at  least  arguable
         that the greater the  hardship  caused  to  an  individual  by  his
         deportation, the more likely it is to act as a deterrent to others.
          Relevant also is  the  seriousness  of  the  Appellant's  criminal
         conduct; more particularly the risk that he will  repeat  it.  That
         risk is only partly offset by the Appellant's track record over the
         past 88 months and consequent enhanced likelihood that he will  not
         reoffend. This is because, as Dr Patel acknowledges, the nature  of
         the offences means that  the  risk  of  repetition  will  never  be
         considered to be a low one.

         Whilst the inevitable degree of hardship that would be faced by the
         LM and the children in consequence of the  Appellant's  deportation
         does not of  itself  amount  to  an  exceptional  circumstance,  we
         nevertheless consider it relevant  (together  with  all  the  other
         circumstances of  the  Appellant's  case)  to  the  proportionality
         exercise that  it  becomes  necessary  to  undertake  once  it  has
         identified circumstances that do not fall within the  contemplation
         of paragraphs 398 to  399A  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   We  have
         therefore considered the issue of proportionality  in  a   holistic
         manner and have concluded that the decision to deport the Appellant
         does not strike a fair balance between the rights and interests  of
         the Appellant and his family members on the one hand and  those  of
         the public on the other.  We therefore find that  the  decision  is
         disproportionate in furtherance of the legitimate aim of preventing
         crime, and that it is thus unlawful by virtue of Section 6  of  the
         Human Rights Act 1998."

The Grounds of Application

10. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had made a material misdirection in  law.  It  was  submitted
    that there was no provision for a deportation appeal to be  allowed  on
    Article 8 grounds outside  the  Rules.   It  is  either  allowed  under
    paragraph  399  or  399A  or   it   is   allowed   under   "exceptional
    circumstances" which is under the Rules  at  paragraph  398  and  is  a
    complete code as upheld by the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.

11. Second, the Tribunal erred by failing to give genuine and proper regard
    to the government's view on what  are  exceptional  circumstances.   In
    order to succeed it has to be more  than  unreasonable  to  expect  the
    children to leave and then not being another family member to care  for
    the chid.  In this  case  the  Tribunal  failed  to  identify  why  the
    circumstances are exceptional and failed to  provide  adequate  reasons
    why family life outweighs the public interest. The wife can  adequately
    care for the children and they can remain in touch via  modern  methods
    of communication.

12.  The  Secretary  of  State  argued  that  the  circumstances  are   not
    exceptional and any separation has been caused by the  actions  of  the
    claimant.  There are no factors which set it  apart  from  an  ordinary
    family life claim.  Whilst it may be 88  months  since  the  claimant's
    offence he has been aware throughout that he may be deported and  would
    have been on his best  behaviour.   There  is  still  a  strong  public
    interest in favour of his deportation given that, should  he  reoffend,
    he would cause significant harm to women and children.

13. The grounds then cite a number of cases supporting the contention  that
    deportation has the effect not only of removing the risk of reoffending
    by the deportee himself but also of deterring other foreign  nationals.



14. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge  French  who  said
    that  the  determination  was  a  clear  and  articulate  document  but
    nevertheless there was merit in the grounds.

15. The claimant served a Rule 24 response, arguing that the  grounds  were
    filed late and in any event misconceived. They ignored  the  fact  that
    the judge adopted the exact analysis contended for by the Secretary  of
    State when she said that the claimant needed to  demonstrate  that  his
    circumstances were exceptional.  The judge had  found  that  there  had
    been significant time elapsed since the offences had  taken  place  and
    was right to consider the hardships which his wife would suffer by  his
    deportation as a relevant consideration.

16. Both Mr Diwnycz and Miss Frantzis relied on their grounds and response.



Findings and Conclusions

17. The application for permission to appeal was made one day out  of  time
    but admitted by the Designated Judge who had sight of evidence that the
    Tribunal's fax machine was not functioning  properly  at  the  relevant
    time.   I showed Miss Frantzis the faxes  which  demonstrate  that  the
    Secretary of State did attempt to put in her grounds  within  time.  On
    that basis she properly did not pursue any argument as to  timeliness.

18. There is no error of law in this determination.  The suggestion in  the
    grounds that the judge misdirected himself as to the law is wrong.   In
    fact both Miss Frantzis and Mr Diwnycz, from the  Presenting  Officer's
    notes, confirmed that it was agreed at the  hearing  that  the  correct
    legal framework was that set out  from  paragraphs  13  to  17  of  the
    determination when the judge set out in full paragraphs  398  and  399,
    399A and 399B of the Immigration Rules.

19. In MF (Nigeria) the Court of Appeal considered the  word  "exceptional"
    and wrote as follows:

         "The word exceptional is often used to denote a  departure  from  a
         general rule.  The general rule in the present context is that,  in
         the case of a foreign prisoner to whom paragraphs 399 and  399A  do
         not apply, very compelling reasons will be required to outweigh the
         public interest in deportation.  These compelling reasons  are  the
         exceptional circumstances.

         We would therefore hold that the new Rules are a complete code  and
         that  the  exceptional  circumstances  to  be  considered  in   the
         balancing exercise involved the application  of  a  proportionality
         test as required by the Strasbourg jurisprudence.   We  accordingly
         respectfully do not agree with the UT that the  decision  maker  is
         not mandated or  directed  to  take  all  the  relevant  Article  8
         criteria into account.

         Even if we were wrong about that it would be necessary to  apply  a
         proportionality test outside the new Rules as was done by  the  UT.
         Either way the result should be the same. In these circumstances it
         is a sterile question whether this is required by the new Rules  or
         is a requirement of the general law.  What matters is  that  it  is
         required to be carried out if paragraphs 399 or 399A do not apply.

         There has been debate as to whether there is a  one-stage  or  two-
         stage test.  If the claimant succeeds on an application of the  new
         Rules at the first hurdle i.e. he  shows  that  para  399  or  399A
         applies, then it can be said that he has succeeded on  a  one-stage
         test.  But if he does not it is necessary to consider whether there
         are circumstances which are sufficiently compelling (and  therefore
         exceptional) to outweigh the public interest in deportation.   That
         is an exercise which is separate from a  consideration  of  whether
         para 399 or 399A applies.  It is the second  part  of  a  two-stage
         approach which, for the reasons we have given, is required  by  the
         new Rules.  The UT concluded that it is required  because  the  new
         Rules do not fully reflect Strasbourg  jurisprudence.   But  either
         way it is necessary to carry out a two-stage process."

20. At paragraph 42 of the determination the judge  reminded  himself  that
    Part 13 of the Immigration Rules  provides  a  complete  code  for  the
    assessment of Article  8  claims  by  persons  who  are  liable  to  be
    deported.  The  Secretary  of  State,  in  assessing  the  claim,  will
    consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and if it does  not,  it
    will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public  interest  in
    deportation  will  be  outweighed   by   other   factors.   Exceptional
    circumstances can only refer to circumstances not  already  within  the
    contemplation of the Rules. The fact that over seven years have elapsed
    since the claimant committed his most recent offence was not  a  factor
    considered by the person who made the decision to deport.

21. The judge clearly identified the considerable time  which  has  elapsed
    since  the  offences  took  place  as  a  significant  factor  both  in
    diminishing the risk that he personally posed and as a reduction in the
    overall proportionality of deportation in  furtherance  of  the  public
    interest in preventing crime.

22. It cannot be said  that  the  judge  did  not  properly  weigh  in  the
    balancing exercise that public interest.  He said  in  terms  that  the
    panel fully shared the public revulsion at the  offences  of  the  type
    committed by  the claimant.

23. The approach of this judge  to  the  determination  of  the  appeal  is
    impeccable.  Having firstly considered whether the claimant could bring
    himself within the contemplation  of  paragraph  398  to  399A  of  the
    Immigration Rules he considered whether there was any other issue which
    was relevant and  not  contemplated  by  them.  Having  identified  the
    considerable period of time elapsed as a significant factor he was then
    entitled to  take  that  into  account  in  considering  the  issue  of
    proportionality in a holistic manner. Assessment  of proportionality is
    a matter for the judge who heard the evidence, and will not be  lightly
    interfered with by an appellate tribunal which has not.

24. The grounds amount to a disagreement  with  the  decision  and  nothing
    more.

Decision

25. The judge did not err in law and his decision stands.
