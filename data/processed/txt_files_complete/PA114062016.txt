                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as above, but the rest of this decision refers to  them
    as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. For reasons given in her  decision  dated  5  October  2016,  the  SSHD
    rejected the appellant's protection claim.

 3. FtT Judge Debra Clapham heard the appellant's appeal on 29  June  2017,
    and allowed it by a decision promulgated on 10 November 2017.

 4. The SSHD has permission to appeal to the UT on the following grounds:

         The appeal is allowed  on  the  basis  that  the  appellant  is  an
         undocumented Bidoon from Kuwait. It is not  disputed  that  such  a
         finding leads to the appellant succeeding  on  asylum  grounds  (as
         well as on human rights grounds).  It  is  unclear,  however,  what
         reasons lead the judge to this finding.

         The judge's findings and reasons are found at  [108]  -  [113].  At
         [108] the judge  finds  that  she  does  not  accept  some  of  the
         respondent's concerns. At [109] she accepts that the appellant  may
         well have attended the demonstration but gives no reason  and  then
         contradicts herself by concluding that she is "unable  to  reach  a
         conclusion one way or the other". At [110] the judge deals with the
         evidence of the two supporting witnesses, who are given credit  for
         travelling to attend the  hearing,  but  it  is  clear  that  their
         evidence adds nothing substantively to the claim. It is simply  not
         clear what evidence the judge relies on to allow  the  appeal.  The
         burden of proof is on the appellant and, although the  standard  of
         proof is relatively low, the burden still needs to be discharged.

         At [113] the judge rejects the respondent's reliance on  section  8
         (the appellant having remained  for  6  months  in  France  without
         seeking asylum)  on  the  basis  that  it  is  "not  a  stand-alone
         section". That is not a lawful basis  for  not  taking  account  of
         section 8.  Failure  to  do  so  renders  the  judge's  credibility
         assessment (if she makes one) fundamentally flawed.

 5. The appellant has filed a rule 24 response, along these lines:

      i) At [108] the judge disagreed with the respondent, finding that  the
         appellant's knowledge of the Bidoon did support his claim, and that
         his attendance at "diwans", being  social  gatherings,  was  not  a
         reason for his historical knowledge not being greater.

     ii) At [110] the judge found it  clear  that  the  two  witnesses  were
         undocumented Bidoons  and  inconceivable  they  would  travel  from
         London to give  evidence  for  a  Kuwaiti  citizen.  Each  of  them
         "described having known the appellant in Kuwait as a member of  the
         undocumented Bidoon community".

    iii) The  judge  thus  accepted  the  evidence  of  the  witnesses,  and
         dismissed the credibility points of the  SSHD,  which  led  her  to
         conclude that the appellant is an undocumented Bidoon.

     iv) The challenge to [109] was based on an  erroneous  reading.   There
         was no self-contradiction.  In any event, it was irrelevant whether
         the appellant attended the demonstration or was arrested.   It  was
         enough for him to be found to be an undocumented Bidoon.

      v) The judge's approach to section 8 was consistent with JT (Cameroon)
         [2008] EWCA Civ 878.  Section 8 factors were  capable  of  damaging
         credibility but did not inevitably do so.

 6. The further points I noted from the submissions of Mr Aslam were these.

      i) The decision had to be read as a whole.  Findings and reasons  were
         not to be derived only from the section under that heading at [108]
         - [113].  There was almost a complete transcript of the evidence at
         [16] - [92], which showed the depth of the decision-making process.

     ii) The finding at [108] was plainly that the appellant  did  have  the
         knowledge to be expected of him if his claimed identity  was  true,
         and that was enough.

    iii) Mr Aslam accepted (correctly) that inability to reach a  conclusion
         at [109] had to be taken as the appellant failing  to  prove  those
         contentions.  However, those were not matters he had to establish.

     iv) The narrative at [110] was to be read as an implicit  finding  that
         the evidence of the two witnesses was accepted.

      v) The terms of [113] were compatible with  the  correct  approach  to
         section 8 issues.

 7. I reserved my decision.

 8. The respondent in the refusal decision at �16 thought the appellant  at
    interview had not shown the knowledge to be expected, while  the  judge
    at [108] thought he had.  Neither the respondent nor the judge gave any
    very  specific  reason;  perhaps  none   could   be   found.    Neither
    representative referred in the UT (nor, apparently, in the FtT) to  the
    questions and answers on which those views were based.  Having done so,
    this appears to be a  borderline  question,  on  which  the  judge  was
    entitled to come down on the side  she  did,  but  not  very  obviously
    decisive one way or the other.

 9. I am not persuaded that [109] is to be read as a finding of a realistic
    possibility that the appellant was at the demonstration, but failed  to
    show he was arrested.  It declines to make a finding.

10. It is always possible that there are passages of evidence which a judge
    cannot resolve one way or the other.  If so, it is more useful  to  say
    that the party with the onus has failed to discharge it.

11. It was correctly argued for the appellant that proof of this  assertion
    was not crucial; but it was also  a  matter  weighing  in  the  overall
    credibility assessment.

12. I am unable to read  into  [110]  a  finding  that  the  appellant  was
    supported by credible evidence of two witnesses who knew him in  Kuwait
    as an undocumented  Bidoon  (which  would  of  course  have  been  very
    significant).  I was not  referred  to  any  such  narrative  of  their
    evidence elsewhere in  the  decision,  and  cannot  identify  it.   The
    comment about it being inconceivable they would travel from  London  to
    give evidence for a Kuwaiti citizen is  followed  by  an  appraisal  of
    their "substantive evidence" which finds it to lead nowhere.

13. Judges should  be  given  some  latitude  in  how  they  express  their
    decisions, and should be presumed to be familiar with key provisions of
    their jurisdiction.   However,  the  approach  to  section  8  in  this
    decision cannot be reconciled with its plain terms.

14. The judge states her conclusion at [111]:  "...  the  appellant  is  an
    undocumented Bidoon".  There is then [112], which is uncontentious, and
    [113]:

         For the sake of completeness I have considered  whether  section  8
         has an effect on the  claim  in  relation  to  credibility.   I  am
         satisfied that it does not on the basis that it  is  not  a  stand-
         alone section.

15. The refusal letter referred to matters relevant to section  8  at  �50,
    and again under the explicit heading "section 8" at  �20-21,  referring
    also to JT.

16. Section 8(1) requires the tribunal "in determining whether to believe a
    statement made by ... a person who makes an asylum  claim  or  a  human
    rights claim ...  to  take  account,  as  damaging  to  the  claimant's
    credibility, of any behaviour to which this section applies".

17. Section 8 (4) applies that requirement to "failure to take advantage of
    a reasonable opportunity to make an asylum claim or human rights  claim
    while in a safe country".

18. The judge might have said,  in  reaching  a  rounded  conclusion,  that
    having taken section 8 matters into account  they  were  not  fatal  to
    credibility; section 8 is not a "stand-alone section"  in  that  sense.
    She could not lawfully reach  her  conclusion  in  advance  of  and  in
    isolation from section 8, and then deal with it only "for the  sake  of
    completeness" i.e. by determining  whether  to  believe  the  appellant
    without taking any account of behaviour which the section  obliged  her
    to take into account.

19. Without that error, the decision might have  been  on  the  margins  of
    adequacy of reasoning; but taking matters raised by the SSHD's  grounds
    as a whole, the decision cannot safely stand.

20. I note the long delay between the hearing and the decision,  for  which
    the judge gives no explanation.  That matter was not taken as a  ground
    of challenge, but it may have contributed to the lack of clarity in the
    eventual analysis.

21. The decision of Judge Clapham is set aside, and stands only as a record
    of what was said at the hearing before her.

22. There is a presumption that the UT will proceed to remake decisions, of
    which parties are reminded in  directions  issued  with  the  grant  of
    permission.  However, the nature of  this  case  is  such  that  it  is
    appropriate under section 12 of the 2002 Act and Practice Statement 7.2
    to remit to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

23. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Clapham.

24. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
