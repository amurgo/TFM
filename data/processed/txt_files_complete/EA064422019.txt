Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr G Brown instructed by First Law Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant appeals with permission a decision of  a  panel  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal ('the Panel') promulgated on the 12 October  2020,
      which  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
      refusal to grant him a Residence Card in recognition  of  a  right  to
      reside in the UK as an Extended Family Member (EFM), the nephew, of an
      EEA national exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.



Background


   2. The appellant is a citizen of India born on 3 February 1991 whose  EEA
      national sponsor is his uncle, Gurwinder Singh, an Irish national.
   3. Having considered the documentary and oral evidence the Panel set  out
      their findings from [13] of the decision under challenge.
   4. It is not disputed the appellant now lives with his  sponsor  and  his
      family in the UK and that the sponsor transfers �150  per  month  into
      the appellant's bank account for his use. The Panel were  informed  in
      evidence that the appellant cannot work and spends  all  his  time  at
      home and is therefore wholly dependent on his uncle.  The  Panel  find
      the appellant has been dependent on his  sponsor  from  2015  to  date
      [14].
   5. The Panel note  that  prior  to  moving  to  the  United  Kingdom  the
      appellant lived with his parents in India being both in education  and
      working on the family farm with  his  father.  The  Panel  record  the
      appellant's evidence that his uncle was helping him and his family  by
      sending about ?40,000 on four occasions between 2008  and  2012,  with
      the last sum of money being received in  2011.  The  Panel  note,  the
      appellant made no reference to receiving funds from the sponsor or any
      of the sponsor's friends during this period prior to 2008.
   6. At [16 - 17] the Panel write:


        16.  The Appellant went on to explain the money was sent to him  by
             his uncle took care of his education because of the  love  his
             uncle felt for him. He further explained that when he finished
             his year 12, he decided he would like to study in  the  United
             Kingdom and his uncle supported his application by gifting him
             4 to  5  Lakh  rupees.  The  money  was  divided  between  the
             Appellant's own account, his father's account and the money he
             held jointly with his father. He believed he might be able  to
             get a copy of the bank statement from his parents but was  not
             sure. He did not have them available  for  submission  at  the
             hearing.


        17.       When he arrived in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Appellant
             advised us that he resided with his  cousin  in  Derby  before
             moving to Glasgow in 2013, where he lived with  friends.  When
             his uncle moved to Glasgow in 2015, he resided with him  there
             until he moved to Cramlington, where  they  still  reside.  Up
             until 2015, his uncle would visit him every month  or  so  and
             give him money, which he used to maintain himself. He  had  no
             other source of income other than the funds  he  brought  with
             him from India in 2012. These funds came from  the  money  his
             uncle had given him to support his Visa application.


   7. The Panel conclude at [24] that the evidence does support the fact the
      sponsor may well have  supported  the  appellant  in  respect  of  his
      education which culminated in the application to travel to the  United
      Kingdom to study, but that no information had been provided as to  how
      he was supported in India other than his inclusion on  a  ration  card
      issued to the family in October 2012. That evidence was,  however,  of
      concern to the Panel as it was noted that both the appellant  and  his
      brother had left home by the time the ration card was  issued  despite
      being named on the same as  family  members,  warranting  very  little
      evidential weight been placed on that document.
   8. The Panel having considered the written  and  oral  evidence  set  out
      their findings between [27 - 29] in the following terms:


        27.  The land owned by the Appellant's father was worked by him and
             the Appellant to generate income and provide funds to maintain
             the family. The income was supplemented  by  the  sponsor  but
             there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate  there  was  any
             meaningful dependency on the money from  the  sponsor  by  the
             Appellant. Any additional benefit to the Appellant was  solely
             in respect of supporting his education.


        28.  We are not satisfied from the evidence placed before us  that,
             on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant was dependent  on
             his sponsor for financial support in respect of his  essential
             needs, nor that he was part  of  the  sponsor's  household  in
             India.


        29.  The grounds of appeal  indicate  the  Appellant  believed  the
             decision had failed to take account of his rights in terms  of
             Article 8 of the ECHR. His representative did not  argue  this
             before us. Any issue in respect of a breach of his  Article  8
             rights can be addressed at the appropriate time. The  decision
             appealed against does not remove the Appellant from the United
             Kingdom and a removal notice will  require  to  be  served  in
             order for that to happen. It is at that time, the question  of
             a  breach  of  the  Appellant's  Article  8  rights   can   be
             considered.


   9. The appellant sought permission to appeal, alleging the Panel had made
      a misdirection in law about  whether  education  formed  part  of  his
      essential needs, asserting that it did,  and  therefore  that  it  was
      necessary for his uncle to provide remittances for  the  appellant  to
      meet his essential needs and that the Judge's  findings  at  [24]  and
      [29] were sufficient to enable the appellant to succeed in his appeal.
      The grounds are set out in further  detail  in  the  pleadings  of  26
      October 2020.
  10. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal on the basis of the author was satisfied the points raised in
      the application for permission to appeal  established  arguable  legal
      error sufficient to warrant a grant of permission to appeal.



Error of law


  11. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Brown relied upon the grounds of appeal
      submitting  specifically  that  as  the  EEA  national   had   assumed
      responsibility for the appellant's  educational  needs,  and  that  as
      education was an essential need of  the  appellant  whilst  he  was  a
      child, that the necessary test had been made out.
  12. It is not disputed that the  appellant's  uncle  is  an  EEA  national
      exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom. It  was  not  disputed
      before the Upper  Tribunal  that  the  Panel  found  that  funds  were
      transferred between the EEA national and the appellant although noting
      some of the funds were transferred by the appellant's  uncle  when  he
      visited India in 2012, by which time the appellant was already in  the
      United Kingdom.
  13. At [24] the Panel find that the evidence supports the fact the sponsor
      may well have supported the appellant  in  respect  of  his  education
      which culminated in him coming  to  the  United  Kingdom  for  further
      studies. The appellant's evidence recorded by the Panel  at  [16],  as
      noted above, was that the  uncle  provided  funds  for  his  education
      because of "the love his uncle felt for him" not  because  there  were
      insufficient funds available to the family to pay for  such  education
      or that otherwise the appellant would  not  have  the  benefit  of  an
      education.
  14. It is not disputed that an EEA sponsor can support a family member  or
      EFM even if other resources are available to that family unit in their
      own right.
  15. Mr Greer, who drafted the grounds, refers to the Home Office  guidance
      on Free Movement Rights: extended  family  members  of  EEA  national,
      version 7.0, and specifically  the  information  at  page  18  in  the
      following terms:

"Dependency or membership of household outside UK

The extended family member must demonstrate they were either:
dependent on the EEA national in a country other than the UK
a member of the EEA nationals household in a country other than the UK

Following the ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union  (CJEU)
in the case of Rahman you can consider the  extended  family  member  to  be
dependent, even though they may not have lived in the same  country  as  the
EEA national. For example, the EEA national has provided  financial  support
to the extended family member while  they  lived  in  another  country.  The
financial support they received shows dependency.

The applicant does not need to be dependent on the EEA national to meet  all
or most of their essential needs. For example, an  applicant  is  considered
dependent if they received a pension which covers half  of  their  essential
needs and money from their EEA  national  sponsor  which  covers  the  other
half.

If the applicant is claiming a right of residence on  the  basis  that  they
were a member of the EEA national's household,  then  they  must  have  been
living with the EEA national in that household in the same country."

  16. The example provided in the guidance is of a family unit who have some
      resources of their own, by way of a pension, insufficient to meet  all
      their essential needs, with the balance of such needs  being  provided
      by the EEA national, hence creating the required element of dependency
      upon the support received from the EEA national to meet such essential
      needs.
  17. The question of dependency has been considered in a number  of  cases,
      both European and domestic.
  18. In Rahman [2012] CJEU Case-83/11 (which followed a  reference  to  the
      CJEU in MR and Ors (EEA extended  family  members)  Bangladesh  [2010]
      UKUT 449 (IAC)) the  CJEU  considered  the  issue  of  dependency  for
      Extended  Family  Members.  The  CJEU  held,  inter  alia,  that  "the
      situation of dependence must exist, in  the  country  from  which  the
      family member concerned comes, at the time when he applies to join the
      Union citizen on whom he is dependent."
  19. In Jia Migrationsverket Case  C-1/05  the  European  Court  considered
      "dependence" under Article 1(1)(d) of Directive  73/148/EEC  and  said
      this was to be interpreted to the  effect  that  "dependent  on  them"
      meant that members of the family of  an  EU  national  established  in
      another member state within the meaning of Article  43   of   the   EC
      Treaty, needed  the  material  support  of  that  EU  national, or his
      or her spouse, in order to meet their essential needs in the state  of
       origin  of  those  family  members  or  the  state  from  which  they
       had  come at the time when they applied to join the EU national.  The
      Court said that  Article   6(b)   of   the   Directive   was   to   be
      interpreted   as   meaning   that   proof    of    the    need     for
      material   support   might   be    adduced    by    any    appropriate
      means, while a mere undertaking by the  EU  national  or  his  or  her
      spouse  to  support  the  family  members  concerned   need   not   be
      regarded  as  establishing  the  existence  of  the  family   member's
      situation of real  dependence.
  20. In Bigia & Others [2009] EWCA Civ 79 at paragraph 24  Maurice  Kay  LJ
      said that where the question of whether someone is a  "family  member"
      depends on a test of dependency, that test is as per paragraph  43  of
      the ECJ's judgement in Jia.  In essence members of  the  family  of  a
      Union citizen needed the material support of that Union citizen or his
      or her spouse in order to meet their essential needs.
  21. In Moneke  (EEA  -  OFMs)  Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00341  (IAC),  at  para
      41, the Tribunal  accepted  that  the  definition  of  dependency  was
      accurately captured by current UKBA ECIs  which  read  as  follows  at
      ch.5.12: "In determining if a family member or extended family  member
       is  dependent  (i.e.  financially  dependent)  on  the  relevant  EEA
       national   for    the    purposes    of    the    EEA    Regulations:
      Financial   dependency  should  be   interpreted   as   meaning   that
      the  person  needs  financial  support  from  the  EEA   national   or
      his/her  spouse/civil  partner  in  order to  meet  his/her  essential
      needs - not in order to have a certain level  of  income.  Provided  a
      person would not be  able  to  meet  his/her  essential  living  needs
      without the financial support of the  EEA  national,  s/he  should  be
      considered dependent on that national. In those circumstances, it does
      not matter that  the  applicant  may  in  addition  receive  financial
      support/income from other sources. There is no need to  determine  the
      reasons for recourse to the financial  support  provided  by  the  EEA
      national or to consider whether  the  applicant  is  able  to  support
      him/herself by taking up paid employment.  The person does not need to
      be living or have lived in an EEA state which the EEA national sponsor
      also lives or has lived."
  22. In ECO Manilla v Lim [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 the Appellant sought  entry,
      as the family member of an EU national. The Appellant had savings  and
      a retirement fund in excess of �55,000 and she owned her own  home  in
      Malaysia valued at �80,000.  The appellant's daughter, married to  the
      EU national, sent her �450 per quarter which  she  used  to  meet  her
      expenses  without  spending   any   capital.    Applying    Reyes    v
      Migrationsverket  (Case  C-  423/12)  it  was   held   that   it   was
      not  enough  to  show  that  the  financial  support   was   in   fact
      provided  by  the  EU  citizen  to  a  family   member;   the   family
      member  must  need  that  support  in  order   to   meet   her   basic
      needs;  there  needed  to  exist  a  situation  of  real   dependence;
      receipt  of  support  was  a  necessary   condition   of   dependency,
      but  not  a  sufficient  condition;  and it was necessary to determine
      that the family member was dependent in  the   sense   of   being   in
      need  of  assistance  even  though  it  was  irrelevant  why  she  was
       dependent.  If,  as   here,   the   family   member   could   support
      herself,  there  was  no  dependency  even  though   she   was   given
      financial  support from the EU citizen.
  23. Article 3(2)(a) of Directive 2004/38/EC reads:


        2.   Without prejudice to any right to free movement and  residence
             the persons concerned may have in their own  right,  the  host
             Member  State  shall,  in   accordance   with   its   national
             legislation, facilitate entry and residence for the  following
             persons:


             (a)   any  other  family  members,   irrespective   of   their
                  nationality, not falling under the definition in  point  2
                  of Article 2 who, in the  country  from  which  they  have
                  come, are dependants or members of the  household  of  the
                  Union citizen having the primary right  of  residence,  or
                  where serious health grounds strictly require the personal
                  care of the family member by the Union citizen;


  24. The core question that arises in  this  case  is  whether  the  person
      claiming to be dependent upon the  EEA  national  family  member  only
      needs to show they have received funds from the EEA national  to  meet
      one of their essential needs, such as education, indicating a singular
      requirement (the appellants case), or whether the requirement  of  the
      Regulation and Directive is for such a person to establish  that  such
      assistance is required to meet all their essential needs as  a  whole,
      the global argument, as found by the Panel. This issue  was  discussed
      with Mr Brown on the basis of a singular versus global argument.
  25. The finding of the Panel is clearly that it is the global argument and
      test that prevails. It is not made out this matter  was  aired  before
      the Panel in the specific terms, but the  Panel's  approach  is  clear
      from their specific findings at [27 - 28] which whilst set out  above,
      I repeat here :


        27.  The land owned by the Appellant's father was worked by him and
             the Appellant to generate income and provide funds to maintain
             the family. The income was supplemented  by  the  sponsor  but
             there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate  there  was  any
             meaningful dependency on the money from  the  sponsor  by  the
             Appellant. Any additional benefit to the Appellant was  solely
             in respect of supporting his education.


        28.  We are not satisfied from the evidence placed before us  that,
             on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant was dependent  on
             his sponsor for financial support in respect of his  essential
             needs, nor that he was part  of  the  sponsor's  household  in
             India.


  26. The  core  finding  of  the  Panel  is  that  the  appellant  had  not
      established that he  require  to  the  material  support  of  the  EEA
      national sponsor in order to meet his essential needs, which  included
      his education. Indeed, as the reason given by the appellant  for  such
      support was due to the love his uncle felt for him the  Panel  finding
      that it had not been established on the evidence  that  the  appellant
      needed the financial support of the EEA national in order to meet  his
      essential needs is a finding within  the  range  of  those  reasonably
      available to the Panel.
  27. I do not find it made out the Panel has erred in law  in  finding  the
      appellant had not established the need for financial support from  the
      EEA national in order to meet his essential need, had not  established
      that those essential needs could not be  met  without  such  financial
      support, and failed to establish  that  the  answer  to  the  question
      whether the appellant required material support of his uncle in  order
      to meet his essential needs was one that can only be answered  in  his
      favour. I find in assessing  this  issue  against  the  whole  of  the
      appellant's essential needs, the global approach,  the  Panel  adopted
      the correct legal test.
