Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms Z Kiss, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr D Bazini, counsel (instructed by Jein Solicitors)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as the secretary of state  and  to  the
      respondents as the claimants.

   2. The secretary of state appeals with permission against the decision of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith, who in a decision  promulgated  on
      27 July 2018, allowed the claimants' appeals on human rights grounds.

   3. The claimants are citizen of Mauritius. The first  two  claimants  are
      husband and wife, born on 10 June 1972 and 13 March 1973 respectively.
      The third claimant is their second son,  born  on  30  November  2000.
      Their elder son, Krishnen Pillay Jagambrun, born on 2  February  1996,
      has leave to remain in the UK until 6 April 2020.

   4. The claimants' immigration history is set out by Judge  Griffith.  The
      first and second claimants entered the UK as visitors in May 2004. The
      first claimant was granted extensions until 30 September 2007 and  his
      wife was granted leave as a student dependant.

   5. In January 2014 an application based on private and  family  life  was
      refused with  no  right  of  appeal.  A  further  student  application
      submitted by the first claimant was refused on 18 February  2008  with
      no right of appeal. On reconsideration that decision was maintained.

   6. On  6  August  2014  the  first  and  second  claimants  were  granted
      discretionary leave to remain until 6 January 2017 in  line  with  the
      leave granted to Kristhnen.

   7. The third claimant, who had remained in Mauritius, applied  for  entry
      clearance to join his  parents  in  June  2015.  His  application  was
      refused and his subsequent appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal
      Judge James on  1  December  2016.  The  third  claimant  subsequently
      entered  the  UK  on  17  December  2016  and  was  granted  temporary
      admission.

   8. Judge James found that there was  no  dependency  established  between
      Kristhnen and his parents. Judge Griffiths  noted  that  this  was  an
      appeal against the decision to refuse to grant entry clearance to  the
      third claimant and the issues considered  were  different  from  those
      before her. She did not consider that she was bound by findings as  to
      dependency [48].

   9. She noted that the core of the current appeal  concerned  family  life
      between the three claimants and Kristhnen and the consequences to  all
      of them in the event of removal [49].  At  the  date  of  the  hearing
      Kristhnen was 22 years old and had lived in the UK since 2004. He  has
      leave to remain until April 2020. The first and second claimants  were
      granted discretionary leave in 2014, as the  secretary  of  state  was
      satisfied that Kristhnen met the Immigration Rules under private  life
      and was dependent on them. She 'understood' that the recent grant  was
      made on the basis that he was able to show compliance  with  paragraph
      276ADE(1)(v) of the Immigration Rules, namely, that he was over 18 and
      had spent at least half of his life  living  continuously  in  the  UK
      [49].

  10. It  was  accepted  that  the  claimants  could  not  comply  with  the
      requirements of Appendix FM of the Rules. In respect of  private  life
      it  was  'considered'  that  they  did  not   meet   the   suitability
      requirements under the Rules as they had failed to reply to a  request
      for information,  nor  could  they  show  that  there  would  be  very
      significant obstacles to their integration into Mauritius [50].

  11. Judge Griffith noted that the secretary of state sent an email to  the
      claimant's representatives. The claimants were  requested  to  provide
      evidence which showed that Kristhnen is still dependent on his parents
      and is still part of the  family  unit.  The  evidence  should  be  as
      current as possible and cover as much  time  as  possible  [51].   The
      email asked that the documents be sent to a particular address  within
      ten working days.

  12. Judge Griffith noted that  there  was  evidence  that  the  claimant's
      representatives  responded  by  email,  attaching   'unparticularised'
      documents. She was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that  the
      claimants'  representatives  replied  in  time  to  the  requests  for
      additional information of dependency and found that the  secretary  of
      state had not discharged the evidential burden on her to show that the
      claimants were unsuitable for the purpose of paragraph 276ADE(1)(i)  -
      [51].

  13.  Even  so,  Judge  Griffith  was  not  satisfied  that  they  met  the
      requirements of paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi).  There  would  not  be  very
      significant obstacles to their integration into Mauritius.  The  third
      claimant could not meet the relevant requirements of the Rules  as  he
      had only been in the UK for a very short period [51].  She  noted  the
      parents claimed that there was  nothing  to  return  to  including  no
      employment. In the result, she found that they could not  satisfy  the
      requirements of paragraph 276ADE in respect of private life [52].

  14. She then considered their claims outside the Rules, noting  that  they
      needed to show that the consequences of refusal would result in unduly
      harsh consequences rendering the decision of the  secretary  of  state
      disproportionate. She noted that the secretary of state accepted  that
      in 2014, Kristhnen was dependent on his parents and that  was  one  of
      the reasons they were granted discretionary  leave  from  August  2014
      until January 2017. The content of the emails seeking evidence of  his
      continuing dependency on his parents "suggests a favourable outcome to
      the [claimants'] claim if sufficient evidence were provided" [53].

  15. She referred to the decision in Ghising (Family Life - Adults - Gurkha
      Policy) [2012] UKUT 00160 at [57] where the Tribunal noted that it has
      been recognised that family life  may  continue  between  parents  and
      child even after the child has attained his majority. She  noted  that
      'other case law was referred to on the dependency between parents  and
      their adult children involving  more  than  normal  emotional  ties  -
      Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31 and that  dependency  is  not  limited  to
      economic dependency [54].

  16. She was satisfied on the evidence that Kristhnen lives as part of  the
      family unit. There is no evidence that since he came to the UK in 2004
      he has lived  anywhere  other  than  with  his  family  or  has  lived
      independently. It is not disputed that he has been working since 2015,
      earning in excess of ï¿½20,000. She considered that he should be capable
      of leading an independent life and it appears that despite  now  being
      an adult, earning a reasonable wage, nothing much has changed at  home
      in that he continues to live rent free, makes no contribution  to  the
      household bills and receives money from time to time from his  parents
      to help defray expenses. He should be capable at his age of leading an
      independent life but, as a matter of fact, he does not  and  has  not.
      The evidence points to dependency of choice, supported by his  parents
      who carry out a number of domestic tasks which he would be capable  of
      doing such as cooking, washing his clothes (which his mother does  for
      him) and the like.

  17. Judge Griffith did not  find  however  that  a  dependency  of  choice
      prevented her from finding that he enjoys family life with his parents
      and younger brother, and removing them would amount to an interference
      capable of engaging Article 8 [55].

  18. Her consideration of  proportionality  involved  balancing  the  wider
      public interest against the particular circumstances of the claimants.
      She noted that Kristhnen now has a place at university. When he was 18
      he had not been able to  apply  for  student  finance,  owing  to  his
      immigration status and the law at the time. Until the law  changed  he
      could not qualify, as he was not settled. After the situation changed,
      following the  decision  in  R.  (on  the  application  of  Tigere)  v
      Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills [2015] UKSC 57,
      all that was required is that he is ordinarily resident in England and
      has been ordinarily resident in  the  UK  throughout  the  three  year
      period preceding the first day of the academic year [56].

  19. Judge Griffith noted that his parents stated that they would  pay  his
      fees if a loan was not approved. He has applied for a loan  for  those
      fees. Even if granted, he will continue to be dependent on his parents
      for some financial and emotional support. Many students rely on  their
      parents throughout their years at university and beyond.  His  parents
      therefore need to remain  in  employment  at  their  current  rate  of
      remuneration to support him and their minor child [57].

  20. She also considered that it would be detrimental to the third claimant
      for him to be separated from his older brother at this stage. They had
      12 years apart, although she accepted  that  there  was  communication
      between them during that period. They are now reunited and enjoy  each
      other's company. Separating them would be unduly harsh for  them  both
      and not necessary in the public interest [58].

  21. She took into account, but did not add much weight to the position  of
      the sister of the first claimant who is  a  British  citizen.  She  is
      receiving treatment which she  is  entitled  to.  Although  the  first
      claimant plays an important role in her care,  there  is  no  evidence
      that if he were not available, nobody else would be able to help [59].

  22. She had regard  to  the  public  interest  considerations  in  s.117B.
      Although  they  had  not  been  able  to  show  compliance  with   the
      Immigration  Rules,  she  was  satisfied  that  there  are  compelling
      circumstances which go to the heart of their family life together with
      Kristhnen,  which  in  a  proportionality   balancing   exercise   was
      sufficient to tip the balance in their favour. Accordingly, the public
      interest did not require their removal and the  secretary  of  state's
      decision was disproportionate [60].

  23. On  9  October  2018,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ford  granted  the
      secretary of state permission to appeal. The arguable grounds included
      the contention that  Judge  Griffith  erred  in  her  findings  as  to
      dependency between the first and second claimants and their elder son,
      Kristhnen. She failed to give adequate reasons for  departing  from  a
      previous finding by the Tribunal that there was no dependency  between
      Kristhnen and his parents, and that she failed to  adequately  explain
      the compassionate circumstances which led  to  the  finding  that  the
      decision was unduly harsh and therefore disproportionate.

Submissions

  24. Ms Kiss submitted on  behalf  of  the  secretary  of  state  that  the
      starting point in the appeal was the finding  of  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge James that Article 8 was not engaged  in  the  third  claimant's
      entry clearance appeal. On the basis of the evidence  before  him,  he
      found that the parents made a difficult choice based on lack of  money
      and on what the arrangements should be regarding their family once the
      father decided to study in the UK.

  25. He found at [19] that they chose to split up the family and bring  the
      mother and eldest child to the UK. As time went on  they  had  a  home
      together and earned sufficient sums to apply to bring  their  youngest
      child to the UK, but for whatever reason, they chose not to do so  for
      more  than  11  years.  The  trigger  of  the  application   was   the
      grandmother's deterioration in health, and it was claimed that by  the
      end of 2014 no other family member 'was willing or able to  take  care
      of the [third claimant]'.

  26. Judge James found that in the absence of any medical or  psychological
      report regarding his feelings of abandonment or suicidal ideation, and
      the absence of any documentary evidence of any contact with the  third
      claimant by his parents since 2004 (by telephone,  email  or  visits),
      and the absence of any evidence of financial support provided  by  the
      parents for the third claimant, he was not persuaded that  '.....there
      is  any  family  life  forged  between  the  parents  and  the  [third
      claimant], or with his older brother other than in name alone; due  to
      the absence of easily accessible evidence which  is  not  before  me'.
      [29]

  27. He found that there is no evidence of the UK son's need to financially
      rely on his parents. He is a healthy fit young man  of  20  years  who
      left school in June 2013 to earn his own living. He thus did not  find
      that there is any dependency between the adult son present in  the  UK
      and his parents. He noted that it was claimed that he is residing with
      his parents (although no evidence of that was provided). This  is  not
      indicative of any dependency, without more [34].

  28. He found on balance that it was in his best interests to remain living
      with his grandmother and extended family members in his own home.

  29. Ms Kiss submitted that there should accordingly be good reasons  given
      for going behind the previous findings, which Judge Griffith  did  not
      do. Simply to state that it was concerned with  entry  clearance  was,
      she submitted, an incorrect approach. In the circumstances, she should
      have taken the decision of Judge James into account.

  30. Moreover, Kristhnen earned ï¿½28,000 per year. This  clearly  is  not  a
      dependency of necessity. She referred  to  the  cross  examination  of
      Kristhnen at [36]. He still claimed to be dependent on his parents  as
      he had not saved and relied on them.

  31. Ms Kiss referred to the Court of Appeal decision  in  Entry  Clearance
      Officer, Sierra Leone v Kopoi [2017] EWCA Civ 1511.  Kugathas  remains
      good law. There must be something more  than  normal  emotional  ties.
      Even if he ceases working he will  still  need  a  loan  in  order  to
      support himself.

  32. She submitted that Article 8  is  a  qualified  right.  People  cannot
      choose where they wish to live. None of the claimants met  the  Rules.
      Reference to emotional ties would not in fact address the findings  of
      Judge James. There had to be something more than that.

  33. On behalf of the claimants, Mr Bazini submitted that there had been no
      material errors of law. The  Judge  took  into  account  all  relevant
      factors and applied Kugathas properly. She reached a decision open  to
      her. The reliance on Deevaseelan is misplaced in the circumstances.

  34. The Judge was dealing with a 'wholly different set of  circumstances'.
      The third claimant applied for entry clearance  to  join  his  parents
      which was refused. Although Judge James found that they could join him
      in Mauritius and go back there, the third claimant, a  minor,  is  now
      living with his mother, father and older brother. The grandparents are
      now deceased.

  35. Judge Griffith heard evidence from the third  claimant  who  described
      his circumstances in Mauritius. However, Judge James did not have  the
      benefit of that evidence. Moreover, all have lived together now  as  a
      family unit.

  36. He referred to the evidence adduced before Judge  Griffith  from  [19]
      onwards. In particular the third claimant who was 17 years old at  the
      date of hearing, stated that he sees his brother  every  day  and  the
      relationship is good and better than it was before. He  is  at  school
      and has just sat seven GCSEs. After being separated for  twelve  years
      it would be hard for him if they were separated again, if he  and  his
      parents hadh to leave the UK. When he was living in Mauritius  he  was
      not close to other members of the family.  He  would  speak  regularly
      with his parents and brother, mainly on the telephone [31].

  37. Mr Bazini referred to the evidence of Kristhnen, who  stated  that  he
      could not go back to Mauritius. He has established a life here. He has
      lived here for half his life and has been educated here. He  described
      his relationship with his brother as  "fantastic".  It  would  greatly
      affect his younger brother if they were parted. He himself would  feel
      devastated given that they had only recently been reunited [35].

  38. He submitted  that  the  Judge's  approach  to  the  'open  and  frank
      evidence' indicates that she considered that the  parents  were  being
      over indulgent.

  39. It was recognised that the secretary of state had sought to  make  the
      Immigration  Rules  Article  8  compliant.  Paragraph  276ADE   (1)(v)
      recognises the private life of a person who has lived  here  for  more
      than half his life.  It  would  be  disproportionate  for  him  to  be
      required to leave. The contention that he can go  and  live  with  the
      rest of his family is accordingly wrong.

  40. Moreover, he submitted that the secretary of  state  herself  did  not
      regard herself as being bound by the decision of Judge James. She  had
      in fact written to the claimants asking  for  updating  evidence.  The
      only reason that that would  have  been  done  would  be  to  consider
      extending the leave to remain even though Kristhnen was over 18.

  41.  Judge  Griffith  found  that  the  claimants  did  not  satisfy   the
      Immigration Rules under paragraph 276ADE in respect of  private  life.
      She set out the basis for this finding at [52]. She also had regard to
      the fact that Kristhnen should be capable of  leading  an  independent
      life. She has properly directed herself at [55]. She found that he has
      lived with his family since he came to the UK  in  2004.  He  has  not
      lived independently. As a matter of fact, he has chosen to  live  with
      his parents.

  42. Judge Griffith had regard to the fact that many students have to  work
      but mainly rely on their parents throughout their years at  university
      and beyond. Kristhnen wishes to live with them and  go  to  university
      which, up until recently, he had been denied. He will thus continue to
      be dependent on his parents for some financial and emotional  support.
      She did not consider that it is not a complete answer to say  that  he
      could get a job [57].

  43. Mr Bazini referred to the decision of Judge James at [34]. He did  not
      find that there is any dependency between the adult son present in the
      UK and his parents. Judge James noted that it is claimed that  the  UK
      son is residing with his parents although  no  evidence  of  this  was
      provided. Nevertheless, that is  not  indicative  of  any  dependency,
      without more [34]. Accordingly Judge James did not make any finding.

  44. He submitted that Judge Griffiths did not  therefore  go  behind  that
      finding. She  had  regard  to  authorities  relating  to  family  life
      including Ghising, supra at [56-62]. At [57] Mrs  Justice  Lang  noted
      that it has been recognised that  family  life  may  continue  between
      parent and child even after the child has attained his  majority.  She
      reviewed the authorities of  the  ECtHR  and  those  in  the  UK.  The
      Tribunal refereed to AA v UK, where it was  noted  that  the  European
      Court found that a significant factor will be whether or not the adult
      child has founded a family of his own.  If  he  is  still  single  and
      living with his parents, he is likely to enjoy life with them [61].

  45. Mr  Bazini  referred  to  the  decision  in  MI  (Paragraph  298(iii):
      "Independent Life") Pakistan [2007] UKAIT 0052. The Tribunal held that
      the mere fact that a person has chosen the lifestyle he has  does  not
      mean that he is to be regarded as leading an independent life.

  46. He submitted that these were all matters which make  the  decision  of
      Judge Griffith sustainable in the circumstances. There were more  than
      the normal emotional ties. There were financial ties. There  was  also
      the relationship between the brothers who have  now  become  reunited.
      The younger brother is a minor and does not fall within Kugathas.  The
      fact that the brothers had been separated for many  years  through  no
      fault of their own and have been reunited, is in itself  a  compelling
      circumstance.




      Assessment

  47.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Griffith  has  undertaken   a   detailed
      assessment of the claimants' evidence before her.

  48. It is evident that she was well aware of the earlier decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge James. She noted that he  was  concerned  with  an
      entry clearance application. She had regard to the evidence that arose
      since then, including the fact that the third claimant was now in  the
      UK and had reunited with his parents and his brother, Kristhnen.

  49. I have also had regard to the secretary of state's email sent  to  the
      claimants' representatives.  In  order  to  move  forward  with  "your
      client's application" they were requested to  provide  evidence  which
      proves that Kristhnen is still dependent on his parents and  is  still
      part of the family  unit.  That  evidence  should  be  as  current  as
      possible and cover as much time as possible. Judge Griffith  found  on
      the balance of probabilities that the representatives had  replied  in
      time to the request for  additional  information  of  dependency.  She
      noted  that  the  content  of  the  emasil  seeking  evidence  of  his
      continuing dependency on his parents suggests a favourable outcome  if
      sufficient evidence were provided [53].

  50. As already noted, Judge Griffith was not satisfied that the  secretary
      of state  had  discharged  the  evidential  burden  showing  that  the
      claimants were unsuitable for the  purposes  of  paragraph  276ADE(1).
      She was nevertheless not satisfied that they had  provided  sufficient
      evidence  to  show  that  they  met  the  requirements  of   paragraph
      276ADE(1)(vi).

  51. When she considered the  claim  outside  the  Rules  she  undertook  a
      detailed evaluation as to whether the consequences  of  refusal  would
      result in unduly harsh consequences and render  the  decision  of  the
      secretary of state disproportionate in the circumstances.

  52. She has properly directed herself  in  accordance  with  the  relevant
      authorities including Kugathas and Ghising [54]. She noted that whilst
      Kristhnen should be capable at his age of leading an independent life,
      as a matter of fact he did not. On the evidence she found that he  has
      lived as part of the family unit. There is no evidence that  since  he
      came to the UK in 2004 he has  lived  anywhere  other  than  with  his
      family.  He has not lived independently. Notwithstanding his  earnings
      from employment nothing much had changed and he continues to live rent
      free, makes no contribution to household bills and receives money from
      time to time from his parents to defray expenses.

  53. In considering whether removing them would amount to  an  interference
      capable of engaging Article 8, she found that a dependency  of  choice
      did not militate against a finding that he enjoys family life with his
      parents and younger brother.

  54. He had been unable on account of his immigration status to  apply  for
      student finance. Before the decision in Tigere he  could  not  qualify
      for a place at university as he was not settled.  The  situation  then
      changed and he fulfils  the  requirements.  She  found  that  even  if
      granted a loan, he would continue to be dependent on his  parents  for
      some financial support and emotional support.

  55. In the circumstances she considered it to be detrimental to the  third
      claimant to be separated from his older brother, having regard to  the
      fact that they had been apart for twelve years, albeit that  they  had
      been communicating during that period. She found that  they  were  now
      reunited and enjoyed each other's company. Separating  them  would  be
      unduly harsh for both of them. That was not necessary  in  the  public
      interest [58].

  56. Although it is conceivable that another Judge might  have  come  to  a
      different  conclusion,  the  reasons  given  by  Judge  Griffiths  for
      concluding that there are  compelling  circumstances  which  tips  the
      balance in their favour are neither irrational nor perverse.
