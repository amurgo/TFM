                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE HANSON:  On 24 November 2014 the applicant  issued  her
    claim by  way  of  judicial  review  challenging  the  refusal  of  the
    Secretary of State to grant her leave to remain in the United  Kingdom,
    dated 19 August 2014, and the rejection of her reconsideration  request
    dated  14  October  2014.  Permission  to  bring  judicial  review  was
    initially refused but  thereafter  granted  following  a  renewed  oral
    hearing by Upper Tribunal Judge Frances on 29 June 2015.

2.   The scope of this hearing and reasons why permission  was  granted  are
    set out in the order of Judge Frances in the following terms:

         "It  is  arguable  that  the  respondent  failed  to  consider  the
         documentary evidence submitted with  the  application  because  she
         makes  no  reference  to  it  in  her   refusal   letter   or   her
         reconsideration letter.


         This issue  not addressed in the acknowledgement of  service  which
         refers to paragraphs 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules when the
         application refused under Appendix FM."

3.   There is  little  dispute  between  the  parties  in  relation  to  the
    applicant's procedural or immigration  history.   The  applicant  is  a
    citizen of Sierra Leone, born on 9 February 1967, who  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom on 19 March 2002 with entry clearance as a visitor valid
    from 4 February 2002 to 4 August 2002.  The applicant claimed asylum on
    23 July 2002 which was refused by the Secretary of State with  a  right
    of appeal. An appeal was lodged by the applicant on  21  November  2002
    and dismissed on 8 January 2004.  The applicant  became  appeal  rights
    exhausted on 14 May 2004  following  refusal  of  the  application  for
    permission to appeal against the adjudicator's decision.

4.   It is not disputed  that  the  applicant  thereafter  reported  to  the
    Secretary of State between 22 April 2003 and 22 April 2004 although  it
    is stated by the Secretary of State that she  thereafter  continued  to
    reside in the country unlawfully.
5.   The applicant finally made an application for leave to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom relying on Article 8 on 5 June 2014  which  was  refused
    with no right of appeal on 19 August 2014.  A  reconsideration  request
    made on 25 September 2014 was rejected by the Secretary of State on  14
    October 2014, thereafter Pre-action Protocol letters were submitted and
    responded to and the judicial review claim issued.

6.   Before this Tribunal Mr Ahmed relies upon his skeleton  argument  dated
    8 April 2016, paragraph 2 of which states that the grounds relied  upon
    by  the  appellant  in  support  of  her  judicial  review  claim   are
    categorised under the following heading: Paragraph 276ADE, Appendix FM,
    Article 8, and the issue of an in-country right of appeal.  That latter
    point has not been pursued before the Tribunal today and I  will  leave
    that aside. The law in relation to a right of appeal when the  impugned
    decision is a refusal to grant leave to remain is set out in Mr Malik's
    skeleton argument and it has not been shown that the applicant  is  the
    beneficiary of a decision that confers upon her a  statutory  right  of
    appeal or, alternatively, that she is able to satisfy the Secretary  of
    State's policy relating to the voluntary making of a removal decision.

7.   On the face of it, in isolation of the other matters, there appears  to
    be no arguable basis for granting relief to the applicant  in  relation
    to that matter.

8.   So far as the remaining decisions are concerned,  as  with  many  cases
    that come before this Tribunal and previously the High Court when  they
    had this jurisdiction, and now in relation to the few cases  they  have
    remaining, not only  did  the  Secretary  of  State  make  an  original
    decision dated 19 August 2014 but also following the grant on 4  August
    2015 issued a supplementary decision.

9.   Mr  Ahmed  at  paragraph  11  of  his  skeleton  argument  asserts  the
    Secretary of State failed to conduct  an  assessment  in  the  original
    decision letter and that it was only after judicial review  proceedings
    were issued and permission granted by UTJ Frances that the Secretary of
    State served a supplementary refusal in order to address  the  defects.
    However, in doing so, the applicant submitted that  the  responded  had
    conceded  that  the  refusal  letter  under  challenge  was  defective.
    Furthermore, it  is  said  the  supplementary  refusal  letter  ignores
    reference to the factual matrix of the applicant's Article 8 claim.  In
    short, it is said the Secretary of State plainly has failed to  address
    her mind to the entirety of evidence submitted.

10.  The original decision of 11 August 2014 refers to the application  made
    on 5 June 2014 for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on  the  basis
    of family and private life in the UK,  which  has  been  considered  by
    reference to Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration  Rules
    and thereafter outside the Immigration Rules in relation to  Article  8
    of the European Convention  on  Human  Rights  in  the  section  headed
    "Decision by Exceptional Circumstances".

11.  In relation to the Appendix FM decision under the 'Partner  Route'  the
    decision maker sets out the correct legal provisions.  It is noted that
    the applicant claimed to be the partner of  a  person  present  in  the
    United Kingdom but also that they were not married  and  the  fact  the
    applicant had stated in her application form that she had  been  living
    with her partner since 2009.

12.  The Immigration Rules in Gen 1.2 of Appendix FM  contain  a  definition
    of the word "partner" for the purposes of the Rules which is defined as
    either the applicant's  spouse,  the  applicant's  civil  partner,  the
    applicant's fiancï¿½ or proposed civil partner or a person who  has  been
    living together with the applicant in a relationship akin  to  marriage
    or civil partnership for at least  two  years  prior  to  the  date  of
    application.

13.  It is not suggested that the applicant  and  her  partner  are  legally
    married following their having gone through a  ceremony  recognised  by
    English law.  The Islamic  ceremony  which  they  went  though  at  the
    mosque, according to the documents provided, does not result in a valid
    marriage so far as the laws of England and Wales are  concerned.  There
    is no evidence of civil partnership or whether it would be  appropriate
    in the circumstances of this couple or of engagement or proposed  civil
    partnership. No claim was made on the basis of either of those heads in
    any event.

14.  The question before the decision  maker  was,  therefore,  whether  the
    applicant had established that she could satisfy the  definition  of  a
    partner on  the  basis  of  evidence  of  cohabitation  for  two  years
    immediately prior to the date  of  the  application  which,  as  stated
    earlier, was 5 June 2014.

15.  The decision maker states, in the briefest terms:

         "As you have not provided evidence that you have lived  with  Abdul
         Kromah for at least two years prior to the date of application. You
         do not meet the definition of a partner and you fail to qualify for
         leave by virtue of Gen  1.2  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
         Rules."

16.  That paragraph was challenged in the  judicial  review  application  on
    the basis that it gave no indication that in coming to that  conclusion
    the decision maker had taken proper heed of the  information  that  had
    been submitted with the application.

17.  The supplementary decision letter of 4 August 2015 refers again to  the
    application of 5 June 2014 and its refusal without a  right  of  appeal
    and the application for permission to bring judicial review.   This  is
    not a fresh decision and clearly states that the letter is supplemental
    too and should be read in conjunction with the original decision of  19
    August 2014.

18.  In relation to the 'Partner Route', again, the  author  of  the  letter
    sets out the correct legal provisions from Appendix FM  before  stating
    the following:

         "It has been taken into account that your client claims to be in  a
         genuine and subsisting relationship with her British partner  Abdul
         Kromah. We note that your client married Mr Kromah  in  an  Islamic
         ceremony on  10  February  2012.  However,  this  marriage  is  not
         recognised under UK law.  As a result,  in  order  to  satisfy  the
         requirements of the Rules above your client must  demonstrate  that
         she has been living with  Mr  Kromah  in  a  relationship  akin  to
         marriage for at least two years prior to the date of application.


         We have carefully reviewed the documents provided in support of the
         application for leave to remain. However these are  not  sufficient
         to cover the two year period required. The  wage  slips  that  your
         client has provided are all addressed to her partner and only cover
         a period of six months between March 2013 and September  2013.  The
         other main form  of  evidence  your  client  produced  was  a  bank
         statement again addressed to her partner covering the period  April
         2013 to October 2013.   These  two  forms  of  evidence  even  when
         combined do not cover a two year period and  do  not  confirm  that
         your client has been living at this address during that time.


         The only evidence we have received addressed to your client are two
         letters from the NHS dated May  2014.  The  letters  provided  from
         friends and family have been considered.   However  their  contents
         cannot be independently verified and we do not  consider  they  are
         sufficient evidence of cohabitation.  Therefore it is not  accepted
         that as at the date of his application your client is  the  partner
         of a person present and settled in the UK as defined  by  paragraph
         Gen 1.2 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

19.  In relation to  the  challenge  to  the  original  decision,  Mr  Ahmed
    confirmed that he is not suggesting there is  an  obligation  upon  the
    decision maker to set out his or her reasons or reasoning in respect of
    each and every aspect of the evidence that had been provided.  That  is
    a factually and  legally  correct  statement.   The  Supreme  Court  in
    Zoumbas v Secretary of State [2013] UKSC 74 at paragraph 23 state  that
    "in our view the Secretary of State does not need to have to record and
    deal what every  piece  of  evidence  in  her  decision  letter".   The
    decision maker in Zoumbas was clearly aware that the children were born
    in the United Kingdom as it is recorded  on  the  fourth  page  of  the
    decision letter.  The letter also recorded that the children were  aged
    7 years, 4 years and 5 months respectively and referred to the evidence
    that the oldest child at primary school.  The decision maker would also
    have been aware from the narrative of the family's immigration  history
    that two of the children had not been to the Republic of Congo.   These
    points are relevant to the fact specific  issues  being  considered  in
    Zoumbas, which related to Section 55 and  the  best  interests  of  the
    children, but clearly show that the Supreme  Court  were  of  the  view
    that, by reference to the content of the decision being  considered  by
    them, they were able to conclude that the decision maker  had  properly
    made himself or herself aware of the relevant facts in issue.

20.  The Tribunal has been referred to two further cases,  the  first  being
    the decision of the Upper Tribunal in Castro (Removal - Section  47  as
    amended) [2014] UKUT 234 which adopted the  reasoning  in  South  Bucks
    District Council and  Porter  [2004]  UKHL  33  in  the  context  of  a
    challenge to  insufficient  reasons  being  given  for  an  immigration
    decision.

21.  Lord Brown in that case noted:

         "The reasons for a decision must be intelligible and they  must  be
         adequate.  They must enable the reader to understand why the matter
         decided as  it  was  and  what  conclusions  were  reached  on  the
         principal important controversial issues disclosing how  any  issue
         of law or fact was resolved. Reasons can  be  briefly  stated.  The
         degree of particularity required depended entirely on the nature of
         the issues falling for decision.  The reasoning must not give  rise
         to a substantial doubt as to whether the decision  maker  erred  in
         law, for example by misunderstanding some relevant policy  or  some
         other important matter or by failing to reach a  rational  decision
         on a relevant ground. But such adverse inference will  not  readily
         be drawn, the reasons need refer only to the  main  issues  in  the
         dispute not to every material consideration."

22.  Lord Brown continued:

         "Decision  letters  must  be  read  in  a  straightforward   manner
         recognising that they are addressed to parties well  aware  of  the
         issues involved and the arguments  advanced.  A  reasons  challenge
         will only succeed if the party aggravated  can  satisfy  the  court
         that he has genuinely been substantially prejudiced by the  failure
         to provide an adequately reasoned decision."

23.  In Hamzeh & Others v Secretary of  State  [2013]  EWHC  4113  Simler  J
    considering  the  ambit  of  jurisdiction  to  quash  a  decision   for
    insufficient reasons noted at paragraph 89:

         "So far as the reasons challenge in this  case  is  concerned,  the
         jurisdiction to quash a decision on public law grounds only  exists
         where there has in fact been an error of law. the court should  not
         intervene to grant judicial review simply because the reasons given
         may disclose an error of law unless  the  perceived  deficiency  in
         reasoning denotes that the decision is  flawed  by  error  of  law.
         Accordingly  insofar  as  the  reasoning  in  any  of  the  refusal
         decisions  in  these  cases  is  deficient,  unless  the  defective
         reasoning indicates or demonstrates that there would  have  been  a
         different outcome so that the decision is in  error  of  law,  this
         court should not intervene."

24.   The  material  before  the  decision  maker  in  this  case,  and  the
    chronology of events, is important when assessing the point in relation
    to Appendix FM.  The application was accompanied by a letter  from  the
    applicant's representatives dated 4  June  2014  which  referred  to  a
    number of statements and documents relied upon in support of the  claim
    to be able to satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  These
    include statements by the applicant, her  partner,  a  landlord,  three
    friends, a letter from the Imam of Brixton  Mosque,  together  with  an
    English language test certificate, marriage certificate,  various  bank
    statements and wage slips of Mr Kromah, correspondence addressed to the
    applicant, the applicant's passport and a copy of Mr Kromah's  passport
    and various photographs of the couple.

25.  The importance of this evidence in relation to the submissions made  on
    the applicant's behalf is that the statements that have  been  provided
    by the applicant clearly show that she was telling the  decision  maker
    that she and Mr Kromah, who she met in 2008,  had  decided  to  rent  a
    place together and had been living at that address since 2009 and  that
    they underwent an Islamic  wedding  ceremony  at  the  Brixton  Islamic
    Centre on 10 February 2012 in front of  Sheikh  Yusuf  Kamara  who  the
    applicant stated she had known since she started to pray in the mosque.



26.  The applicant's partner states that they commenced renting  a  room  at
    the stated address in 2009 and that after  three  years  together  they
    decided to get married and married on 10 February 2012.

27.  There is a letter from a third party stating  that  the  applicant  and
    her partner rent part of her property but no dates regarding the period
    of rental is provided.  A  letter  of  25  September  2013  confirms  a
    marriage at the Brixton Mosque on 10 February 2012  with  both  parties
    living happily together as man and wife, a further letter of 3  October
    2013 again refers to a wedding at Brixton Mosque on 10 February 2012.

28.  The letter from the Imam of the mosque states that he  conducted  their
    wedding on 12 February 2012 and has attached to it an Islamic  marriage
    certificate certifying that on that date the applicant and her  partner
    underwent a ceremony of marriage. It is submitted that  that  was  very
    powerful evidence before the decision maker of the fact that since 2009
    the applicant and her partner had been living together  in  the  stated
    property.

29.  Two issues arise from the correspondence.  Firstly it is  noted  a  lot
    of it is dated mid-2013 or towards the end of 2013, making it  somewhat
    dated for an application made in June 2014, but I  put  that  aside  as
    being a fact of no consequence as it was not raised as an issue  before
    me.  The second point is that the requirement is not that  the  parties
    have lived together for two years prior to the date of the application,
    it is that they have lived together in a relationship akin to  marriage
    for the relevant period.

30.  Representatives seem somehow to ignore  or  forget  that  the  required
    test in Gen 1.2 is not only that the parties do live together but  also
    the capacity in which the live together, namely in a  role  similar  to
    that of man and wife. No particular point has been raised  in  relation
    to that so I take it as a neutral point when considering the merits  of
    the challenge and whether to grant the relief sought or not.

31.   Following  receipt  of   the   original   decision   the   applicant's
    representatives sent a further letter to the Secretary of State  asking
    her to review the decision.  That letter is dated 15 September 2014 and
    has attached to it a number of additional documents, twelve  in  total,
    being two letters from the NHS and documents  described  as  supportive
    statements dated August and September 2014  from  various  friends  and
    associates of the applicant.

32.  The issue that arises from these documents is clearly  demonstrated  by
    the copy letters appearing at pages 104, 105, 106, 109 and 110  of  the
    applicant's judicial review bundle. At page 104 is a letter from Dusuba
    Kabba claiming that she has known the applicant and her  partner  since
    2009 as a family friend, has been visiting  them  since,  stating  that
    they always do things together and that the  applicant  has  been  very
    helpful to her as a friend, and that she sometimes helps out  with  the
    children.  This person,  who  declares  a  close  friendship  with  the
    applicant then states that she helped organise their  wedding  in  July
    2012 and that they had been living together since she has known them.

33.  At page 105 is a letter from  Hajaratu  Salaam  claiming  that  he  has
    known the applicant and her partner since 2007 and was also  a  witness
    at their marriage in July 2012 and that they have been  living  happily
    together ever since.  At page 106 is a  letter  from  Victoria  Bangura
    again stating that she has known the applicant and  her  partner  since
    2005 and that she witnessed their marriage in July 2012 and  that  they
    have been living happily together ever since. At page 107 is a  further
    letter confirming marriage in 2012 without  specifying  the  month  and
    confirming that since they married they have been  living  happily.  At
    page 108 a letter confirming marriage in 2012, confirming that they are
    happy.  At page 109 a letter from Annieti Sandra  Roberts  states  that
    she had known the couple since 2003 and that they seem to be very loyal
    to each other, got married in July 2012, and have been living  together
    since then. At page 110 Akan Nkweini claims to have  known  the  couple
    since mid-2006.  "I have known them to have gotten married in July 2012
    and have been living together since then".

34.   That  information  was  before  the  decision  maker  prior   to   the
    supplemental decision letter of 4 August 2015 and it is reasonable  and
    appropriate that I consider the challenge to the  conclusions  relating
    to Appendix FM and the 'Partner Route' on the  basis  that  this  is  a
    decision that  has  been  reached  considering  not  only  the  initial
    evidence provided but also the supplementary  material.   Without  that
    supplementary material Mr Ahmed  may  have  had  a  good  argument  for
    suggesting that the impugned decision, claiming that the applicant  had
    not provided evidence that she had lived with Abdul Kromah for at least
    two years prior to the date of the application, warranted relief  being
    granted as sought. What the decision maker was faced with when  looking
    at the matter again and reviewing all the documents for leave to remain
    in further detail, was not one but five additional pieces  of  evidence
    which contradict the material originally relied upon in support of  the
    application for leave under Appendix FM.

35.  I accept it may be arguable that one could interpret the fact that  the
    parties married in July 2012 and have lived together happily  since  as
    not being a comment that they commenced cohabitation at that point, but
    rather of the fact that they still remain happily  married  and  living
    with each other post marriage, but there  is  clear  ambiguity  in  the
    evidence before the decision maker.

36.  The obligation of proving that an  individual  is  able  to  satisfy  a
    requirement of the Immigration Rules falls upon the person making  such
    allegation on the basis of the material  they  make  available  to  the
    decision  maker.  The  conclusion  in  the   original   decision   that
    insufficient evidence had been provided to  show  cohabitation  for  at
    least  two  years  prior  to  the  date  of  application  or   in   the
    supplementary decision that it is not accepted  that  at  the  date  of
    application the applicant is a partner of a person present and  settled
    in the UK as defined in  paragraph  Gen  1.2  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules, has not been shown to be an irrational  decision  or
    one that is unreasonable on the basis of all the  material  before  the
    decision maker.  That information, when considered  in  the  round,  is
    clearly  contradictory  in  relation  to  a  material  aspect  of   the
    applicant's claim.

37.  The decision maker then considered the merits  of  the  application  by
    reference to the  applicant's  private  life  under  276ADE(1)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The original decision refers to 276ADE(iii),  (iv),
    (v) and (vi) and although there is criticism in the grounds  that  only
    one of those paragraphs was actually relevant, the fact of  the  matter
    is that the applicant had only lived in the United Kingdom  for  twelve
    years and had not established that she had lived in the United  Kingdom
    continuously for at least the twenty year period required  for  her  to
    succeed under  276ADE(iii).   The  decision  maker  comments  upon  the
    relationship of the applicant's age to other requirements of 276ADE and
    thereafter goes  on  to  consider  in  relation  to  276ADE(1)(vi)  the
    requirement to prove that there were very significant obstacles to  the
    applicant's integration into the country to which she would have to  go
    if required to leave the United Kingdom.

38.  The decision on this point is that it is not accepted  there  would  be
    very significant obstacles to integration  into  Sierra  Leone  if  the
    applicant was required to leave because she would be returning back  to
    her home country where she had lived for 35 years and be returning as a
    family unit.

39.  In relation to the supplementary decision considering the  question  of
    insurmountable  obstacles,  it   states   that   the   seriousness   of
    difficulties  which  the  applicant  and  her  partner  would  face  in
    continuing  their  family  life  outside  the  UK  and  whether   those
    difficulties would constitute something that they could  not  or  could
    not reasonably be expected to overcome even with a degree  of  hardship
    to one or more  of  the  individuals  concerned  had  been  taken  into
    account.

40.  The case law relating to the requisite test makes it  clear  that  when
    considering the question of insurmountable  obstacles  under  paragraph
    EX1, with reference to R (on the application) Agyargo [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    440, that  the  phrase  "insurmountable  obstacles"  as  used  in  this
    paragraph of the Rules clearly imposes a high hurdle to be overcome  by
    an applicant for leave to remain under the Rules. It is said "the  test
    is significantly more demanding than a mere test of  whether  it  would
    reasonable to expect a couple to continue their family life outside the
    UK.  The phrase used in the Rules is intended to have the same  meaning
    as in the Strasbourg jurisprudence, it is clear that the  ECHR  regards
    it as a formulation imposing a stringent test in respect of that factor
    as is formulated by Januzzi v The Netherlands at paragraph 117 where it
    was said there were no insurmountable obstacles to the family  settling
    in  Surinam  and  even  though  the  applicant  and  her  family  would
    experience hardship if forced to do so".

41.  "However, although this assessment involves  a  stringent  test  it  is
    obviously intended in both the case law and the Rules to be interpreted
    in a sensible and practical rather than a purely literal way.  Moreover
    the insurmountable obstacles criteria is used in the  Rules  to  define
    one of the preconditions set out in Section  EX1B  which  needs  to  be
    satisfied before an applicant can claim to be entitled  to  be  granted
    leave to remain under the Rules".

42.  "In that context it is not simply a factor to be  taken  into  account.
    However in the context of making a wider Article 8  assessment  outside
    the Rules it is a factor to be taken  into  account,  not  an  absolute
    requirement which has to be satisfied in every case  across  the  whole
    range of cases covered by Article 8.  The mere fact that Mr Bennett,  a
    British citizen, has lived all his life in the United  Kingdom,  has  a
    job here and hence might find it difficult and might  be  reluctant  to
    relocate to Ghana to continue their family there could  not  constitute
    insurmountable obstacles to his doing so".

43.  The importance of the above decision is that it has not been  made  out
    before me that the conclusion in the  original  impugned  decision,  by
    reference to very significant obstacles or when considering Appendix FM
    to insurmountable obstacles, or in the supplementary decision has  been
    shown to be irrational, Wednesbury unreasonable, or unfair on the basis
    of the information before the decision maker.

44.  It is clear that whatever may have been the  situation  initially  with
    regard to the evidence vis-ï¿½-vis partnership  which  I  commented  upon
    earlier, bar a short paragraph in the applicants representatives letter
    of 4 June 2014 claiming that as the applicant's partner  is  a  British
    citizen settled in the UK  after  being  granted  asylum  (which  is  a
    statement that is factually incorrect as he was granted ILR and refused
    refugee status) little relevant evidence was  provided  to  prove  this
    point. The basis of the claim under  this  head  is  the  assertion  Mr
    Kromah has been living in the United Kingdom since 2003  and  became  a
    British citizen in September 2010, has two jobs, is not in  receipt  of
    public funds, has strong community and emotional and financial ties  to
    the UK and therefore there are insurmountable obstacles preventing them
    from having a life outside the UK.
45.  Whilst those individual elements may be relevant to  assessing  whether
    insurmountable obstacles exist,  the  question  is  whether  there  are
    difficulties  that  make  the  prospect   of   relocation   effectively
    unreasonable or unrealistic.  What was not before the  decision  maker,
    either at the time the original impugned decision or the  supplementary
    decision is sufficient material to show that the family unit if  forced
    to relocate to the applicant's home state would experience hardship  of
    a sufficient degree to satisfy the required legal test.

46.  Having rejected the claim under  the  Immigration  Rules  the  decision
    maker went on to consider the matter outside the Rules by reference  to
    Article 8 ECHR.  The challenge to this element of the decision  process
    relates to the failure of the decision maker to take  into  account  or
    set out the factual matrix relating to the decision in question.

47.  I refer back to the quote from the Supreme Court  in  Zoumbas  earlier.
    In the original impugned decision the decision maker considered whether
    the application raised  exceptional  circumstances  consistent  with  a
    right to respect for private and family life  contained  in  Article  8
    which might warrant a grant of leave and found that no such exceptional
    circumstances had been raised in the application.  In the supplementary
    decision letter the decision maker notes the applicants claim  to  have
    met Mr Kromah in 2008 and to having started lived together in 2009, but
    states  that  the  relationship  started  and  developed  in  the  full
    knowledge that the applicant's immigration status  is  precarious,  the
    applicant and her partner were fully aware of  her  immigration  status
    and would have been aware that she may  not  be  able  to  continue  to
    remain in the UK.

48.  With any challenge to a  human  rights  Article  8  claim  in  judicial
    review proceedings the Tribunal is not looking at the process by  which
    the decision was arrived at but the  outcome  of  the  decision  making
    process and whether that gave rise to any  arguable  claim  that  there
    will be a breach of Article 8.

49.  The  original  decision  referring  to  the  lack  of  any  exceptional
    circumstances having been raised to prove entitlement or  to  challenge
    the proportionality of the decision may, in itself, be determinative of
    this aspect of the claim for if no such exceptional circumstances  were
    relied upon or pleaded it cannot be  irrational  or  unlawful  for  the
    decision maker not to do more than or  she  did  in  relation  to  this
    matter by stating that as no such circumstances have been raised it has
    not been established that it is appropriate to grant  leave  to  remain
    outside the Immigration Rules on his basis.

50.  In  the  supplementary  decision,  however,  the  decision  maker  went
    further and states:

         "Whilst it is acknowledged that your client's partner is settled in
         the UK this does not mean that he and your  client  are  unable  to
         live  together  in  Sierra  Leone.   Article  8  of  the   European
         Convention on Human Rights does not oblige the  UK  to  accept  the
         choice of a couple as to which country they would prefer to  reside
         in.  Furthermore no evidence has been provided to  show  that  your
         client and her partner cannot return to Sierra Leone  lawfully  and
         live there.  A mere wish or preference to live in the UK would  not
         amount to an insurmountable obstacle.


         Furthermore, whilst it is claimed there may be a  cultural  barrier
         for your  client's  partner  to  live  in  Sierra  Leone  and  some
         adjustment may be needed, this is not sufficient to  amount  to  an
         insurmountable obstacle. Just as your  client  faced  a  change  of
         culture to live in the United Kingdom it  is  not  unreasonable  to
         expect the partner to face a change of culture to  live  in  Sierra
         Leone in order to continue their life together. No evidence of  any
         particular hardship in adjusting to life in Sierra Leone  has  been
         submitted. Therefore  it  is  considered  that  the  difference  in
         culture would not amount to an insurmountable obstacle."

51.  In the  supplementary  decision  letter  by  reference  to  exceptional
    circumstances the decision maker states:

         "It has also been considered whether the  particular  circumstances
         set  out  in  your  client's  application  constitute   exceptional
         circumstances which  consistent  with  the  right  to  respect  for
         private and family life might warrant consideration of a  grant  of
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom outside the Rules"

52.  Again it is stated:

         "Your client has not  raised  any  exceptional  circumstances  that
         would result in it  being  unjustifiably  harsh  were  they  to  be
         removed from the UK. As stated above,  your  client's  partner  can
         return to Sierra Leone with your client  and  enjoy  a  family  and
         private life."

53.  In relation to human rights proportionality  assessment,  when  looking
    at the Razgar questions generally, in the supplementary decision it  is
    accepted the applicant and Mr Kromah have a relationship  as  indicated
    by the reference to the applicant and her partner.  Mr Kromah's settled
    status in the United Kingdom is specifically  referred  to  as  is  the
    applicant's immigration history and lack  of  evidence  of  an  adverse
    impact of the decision such as to make the  decision  disproportionate.
    Such elements were therefore adequately considered  and  factored  into
    the decision making process.

54.  In addition, the provisions of Section 117A and B of the 2002  Act  (as
    amended)are applicable, the relevant  part  of  which  in  relation  to
    private life states that little weight should be attached to a  private
    life formed at a time a person's immigration status was precarious.

55.  I find when considering both decisions and the evidence in  the  papers
    provided, that  the  decision  maker  clearly  took  into  account  the
    material that had been put before him or her and relied upon in support
    of the claim. I do not find it has been made out  before  the  Tribunal
    today that the decision in relation to whether to grant  leave  outside
    the Rules and the finding that refusing to do  so  is  a  proportionate
    decision is arguably irrational, unfair, or unlawful,  based  upon  the
    material before the decision maker.

56.  For all these reasons, taken cumulatively, I find  that  the  applicant
    has failed to discharge the burden of proof upon her to show  that  she
    is entitled  to  the  relief  sought  and  accordingly  this  claim  is
    dismissed.


57.  The order that I shall make as to costs is  that  the  applicant  shall
    pay the respondent's costs summarily assessed in  the  sum  of  ï¿½4,685.
