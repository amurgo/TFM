Representation:
Appellant   Mrs Cleghorn, Counsel, instructed by Halliday Reeves
      Law Firm
Respondent  Mr Dewison (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a citizen of the  United  States  of  America.  The
       appellant  applied  for  entry  clearance  on  August  5,  2013.  On
       September  23,  2013  the  respondent  wrote  to   the   appellant's
       solicitors requesting further information including details  of  the
       appellant's husband's employment and income to enable the respondent
       to consider whether the Rules were met.
    2.  On  September  26,  2013  the  representative  responded  enclosing
       documents but advising the  employment  evidence  was  awaited.  The
       evidence was not received and on October 31, 2013 the representative
       was advised the application failed because the  financial  threshold
       was not met. However, the appellant  was  further  advised  a  final
       decision would be placed on hold due to the legal challenge made  by
       the respondent in MM. In April 2014 evidence of a salary  in  excess
       of �18,600 was submitted.

    3. Following the decision of MM the respondent refused her  application
       on August 29, 2014.

    4. The appellant appealed that decision  under  section  82(1)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on November 18, 2014.

    5. The appeal came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Doyle  on
       June 22, 2015 and in a decision  promulgated  on  July  2,  2015  he
       refused the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules and under
       article 8 ECHR.

    6. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on July 17,  2015  submitting
       the First-tier Judge had erred in his approach to the assessment  of
       the appellant's article  8  claim  and  the  effect  of  the  delay.
       Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Ford on October 6, 2015.

    7. In a Rule 24 letter dated October 16, 2015  the  respondent  opposed
       the appeal.

    8. The matter came before me on the above date and I heard  submissions
       from both representatives.

    9. The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
       pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 I make no order.

SUBMISSIONS

   10. Mrs Cleghorn submitted that there had  been  a  material  error  and
       posed the question whether it was  proportionate,  given  the  delay
       brought about Court of Appeal decision, to expect the  appellant  to
       lodge a fresh application when the  Court  may  have  supported  the
       stance taken by Mr Justice  Blake  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  MM.
       Alternatively, whilst there was a legitimate in ensuring  the  Rules
       were met, the evidence before the Judge was that before the decision
       was taken the parties met the Rules. Requiring a  fresh  application
       was disproportionate. She referred me to paragraphs [100]  to  [107]
       of MM.

   11. Mr Dewison  relied  on  the  Rule  24  response  and  submitted  the
       chronology was important. When  the  application  was  submitted  in
       August 2013 the appellant did not meet the financial requirements of
       the Rules. When her application  was  placed  on  hold  pending  the
       decision in MM the respondent made  it  clear  the  application  had
       failed to  satisfy  the  Rules.  At  the  hearing  counsel  for  the
       appellant had accepted the Rules and the  Judge  took  into  account
       everything being argued today and found it was not  disproportionate
       for the appellant to re-apply.

   12. I reserved my decision.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

   13. The appellant applied in August 2013 for admission as a  spouse.  At
       that date she was fully aware there was an income requirement of  at
       least �18,600. The sponsor earned �14,000. The application was bound
       to fail.

   14. Mrs Cleghorn, with permission from Judge  of  the  First-tier  Ford,
       seeks to argue the delay between placing the appellant's application
       on hold and the date of the eventual decision, coupled with the fact
       they now met the Rules, meant the appeal should  have  been  allowed
       outside of the Rules.

   15. The chronology is not disputed and the respondent  accepts  that  by
       the time the decision was made the appellant met the Rules. However,
       as previously conceded by Mrs Cleghorn, the relevant date was August
       5, 2013. The appellant knew she did not meet the  Rules  and  rather
       than re-apply she chose to await the Court of Appeal's  decision  to
       save paying a further application fee.

   16.  Following  MM  being  handed  down  the  respondent   refused   the
       application but this decision was effectively a confirmation of  the
       initial indication given as long ago as October 31, 2013.

   17. Mrs Cleghorn argues the delay is a  factor  the  Judge  should  have
       taken into account when considering proportionality but I  disagree.
       The appellant knew full well in October 2013 the Rules were not  met
       and accordingly the decision in August 2014 came as no surprise.  If
       the Court of Appeal had ruled in her favour, then this appeal  would
       not be before me and I therefore see no merit in her  argument  that
       the appellant should benefit from the fact the respondent's  refusal
       in October 2013 was subsequently found to be correct in August 2014.



   18. The Judge considered  the  application  outside  of  the  Rules  and
       reminded himself that Section 117B(1) of the 2002  Act  states  "the
       maintenance of effective immigration is in the public interest".

   19. In oral evidence the sponsor accepted there was nothing  to  stop  a
       fresh application being submitted as he continued to meet the  Rules
       but his explanation for not doing this was because of the  time  and
       money invested in the current application.

   20. At paragraph 14(i) the Judge reminded himself that the issue in this
       appeal  was  "proportionality".  He  concluded  that  requiring  the
       appellant to submit a fresh application was not  a  disproportionate
       interference.

   21. It had been the appellant's refusal to submit  an  application  that
       met the Rules that had led to family life,  as  they  wanted,  being
       interfered with.

   22. Moreover, it seems almost two years have passed since she would have
       been able to meet the Rules and it is a shame  that  an  alternative
       approach was not taken by the appellant and her husband  bearing  in
       mind a failure to meet  the  financial  requirements  was  the  only
       reason this application was refused.

   23.  The  Judge's  decision  was  well  reasoned  and  his  findings  on
       proportionality were open to him. As he pointed  out  in  July  last
       year the appellant's option is to submit a fresh application.

   24. There is no error in law.

DECISION

   25. The making of the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
       involve the making of an error on a point of law. I uphold the First-
       tier decision.
