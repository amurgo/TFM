Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Karim, Counsel, instructed by Malik Law
                    Chambers Solicitors (Bethnal Green Road)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant's appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  J  J
    Maxwell, following a hearing at Hatton Cross in July 2014.  The appeals
    of his parents, and his younger brother, however, which were considered
    in a joint hearing and a joint determination, were allowed on Article 8
    grounds.  In essence the reasoning was  that  the  appellant's  younger
    brother was soon to take his GCSE examinations, and it  was  considered
    disproportionate to remove him before these were  taken.   He  and  his
    parents should therefore be permitted to remain long enough  for  these
    to be completed, but the appellant himself could return  to  Mauritius,
    because he had reached a break in his studies, having obtained his  law
    degree and completed the legal practice course.

2.   The appellant was granted permission to appeal by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Grant-Hutchison, on 11 September 2014.  The grounds  for  seeking
    permission to appeal had been concerned (1) with the assessment of  the
    appellant having "no ties" to  his  country  of  origin;  and  (2)  the
    approach to Article 8.

3.   There was no cross appeal by the Secretary of State in relation to  the
    appeals being allowed for  the  appellant's  younger  brother  and  his
    parents.  This was confirmed by Mr Walker at the hearing before me.

4.   At the start of the hearing Mr  Karim,  for  the  appellant,  indicated
    that he was no longer pursuing the first ground,  in  relation  to  "no
    ties" to Mauritius.  He applied to advance two new grounds, in addition
    to the remaining ground about the legal framework for Article  8.   The
    first of these was that there had been no consideration  given  to  the
    public benefit of the appellant's presence in  view  of  his  voluntary
    work and academic achievements, with reference to UE (Nigeria) & Others
    v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 975.  The  second  additional  ground  was  that
    there had been a lack of consideration of the appellant's  relationship
    with his immediate family, either in terms of family  life,  or  as  an
    aspect of private life.

5.   There was no objection by Mr Walker to the proposed amendments  to  the
    grounds, and I  allowed  both  to  be  argued.   I  indicated  that  my
    preliminary view was that the strongest arguable  point  concerned  the
    judge's approach to the appellant's  relationship  with  his  immediate
    family.

6.   Mr Karim's submissions on this ground can  be  summarised  as  follows.
    The appellant's relationship with his  younger  sibling  had  not  been
    mentioned at all in the consideration of the appellant's  relationships
    with  his  family  members  at  paragraph  24  of  the   determination.
    Paragraphs 50 to 62 of the Upper Tribunal decision in  Ghising  (family
    life - adults - Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 00160 (IAC)  made  it  clear
    that a strict reading of  Kugathas  v  SSHD  [2003]  EWCA  Civ  31  was
    incorrect.  The approach to a consideration of whether there was family
    life between the appellant and his parents, and  his  younger  sibling,
    had to take into account that the appellant had never  established  any
    independent life outside his family.  It was noted, at paragraph 59  of
    Ghising, that the Court of Appeal had considered similar  facts  in  RP
    (Zimbabwe) and Another v SSHD [2008]  EWCA  Civ  825.   Sedley  LJ  had
    commented that it would be  unreal  to  dispute  that  a  23  year  old
    appellant enjoyed family life with  her  parents  when  she  had  lived
    continuously with her parents and siblings for all of her  life.   This
    is factually similar to the current  case.  The judge as  a  specialist
    Tribunal should have been aware of Ghising, even if it was not drawn to
    his attention by  the  representatives.   In  addition  the  judge,  at
    paragraph 24 of  the  determination,  had  not  gone  on  to  give  any
    consideration to  the  appellant's  relationships  with  his  immediate
    family as an aspect of his private life ties to the UK.

7.   Mr Walker, in response, noted that  the  Kugathas  case  was  cited  at
    paragraph 23 of the judge's determination.  He  agreed,  however,  that
    Ghising was a well-known case of which  the  parties,  and  the  judge,
    would have been aware.  He agreed, on behalf of the Secretary of State,
    that the judge's consideration of the appellant's relationship with his
    family had  involved  an  error  on  a  point  of  law  in  the  narrow
    application  of  Kugathas,  and  the  lack  of  consideration  of   the
    relationships within private life.

8.   In view of this agreement, which appeared to  me  to  be  sensible  and
    properly reached, I  indicated  that  I  found  the  ground  about  the
    approach to the appellant's  relationship  with  his  immediate  family
    members to be made out.  I therefore accept that  the  judge  erred  in
    law, in a manner material to the outcome, both  in  applying  a  narrow
    approach  to  Kugathas,  which  was  held  by  Ghising  to  be  legally
    erroneous, and also in not  considering  the  appellant's  relationship
    with his parents, his relationship with his younger  sibling,  and  the
    impact on all family members of the separation, as an aspect of  either
    the appellant's family or private life.  The decision  therefore  falls
    to be set aside.

9.   I indicated at the hearing that I proposed remaking  the  decision  for
    the appellant to be in line with the rest of  his  family.   I  invited
    submissions.  Both Mr Walker and Mr Karim had no objection, and did not
    wish to make any further submissions.

10.  Mr Karim made detailed  submissions  on  the  approach  to  Article  8.
    These were based on paragraphs 128 to 130 of MM (Lebanon) v SSHD [2014]
    EWCA Civ 985, on the basis that these had  overturned  the  arguability
    threshold  approach  in  Gulshan  and  other  cases.   He   also   made
    submissions about the public benefit point, on the basis that this  had
    been held, in UE (Nigeria) to be a matter capable of being  a  relevant
    consideration in the  proportionality  assessment.   Mr  Karim  agreed,
    however, that there was no need for me to  consider  the  other  points
    given the proposed remaking in line with the rest of the family.

11.  Neither side made any reference to a fee award.  The  First-tier  Judge
    made fee  awards  for  three  of  the  appellants,  but  not  for  this
    appellant.  Having decided to remake the appeal by allowing it  I  have
    decided to make a whole fee award for this appellant, in line with  the
    rest of the family.  The outcome of the remaking  does  not  depend  on
    matters not raised with the applications.  Neither side suggested  that
    there was any need for anonymity, and I make no such order.

Notice of Decision

The judge's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal involved an error  on
a point of law, and that decision is set aside.  The decision is  remade  as
follows.

The appeal is allowed on Article 8 grounds on the same  basis  and  in  line
with the appellant's parents and brother.

No anonymity order is made.
