Upper Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber)    Appeal Number: DA017502014

Heard at Field House
Decision & Reasons Promulgated

 On 9 June 2016
       On 10 June 2016


                                  APPELLANT
                            MR ADEWUNMI ADESANYA



                                 RESPONDENT
               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT



                                 Directions


This case was listed before me on 9 June 2016.  The hearing  was  adjourned.
Following the promulgation of  my  decision  on  the  error  of  law  on  26
February 2016, the Upper Tribunal issued a reported decision in  Chege  ("is
a persistent offer") [2016] UKUT 00187 (IAC).  It is my  considered  opinion
that further findings of fact will need to be made in this case in light  of
what is set out in head note 3 of Chege.

As I had  set  aside  the  First-tier  Judge's  decision,  I  considered  it
appropriate that this case be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  re-
hearing.

The appeal is therefore remitted to Taylor House for re-hearing by a judge
other than FtTJ Higgins.
