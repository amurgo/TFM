Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R O'Ryan, instructed by Scudamores, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Steward, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Ye Mang, was born on 27 May 1976 and is a  male  citizen
    of Burma.  On 5 November 2009, a decision was made to refuse  to  grant
    the appellant asylum and to remove him from the United Kingdom  by  way
    of directions under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act  1999.
    The appellant appealed against that latter decision to  an  Immigration
    Judge (Judge Sarsfield)  who,  in  a  determination  promulgated  on  6
    January 2010, dismissed the appeal.  Following a grant of permission in
    the High Court, the appeal eventually came before Upper Tribunal  Judge
    D E Taylor who set aside Judge  Sarsfield's  determination  and,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 3 October 2012,  remade  the  decision  by
    dismissing the appeal.  The appeal now returns to the Upper Tribunal by
    way of a consent order in the Court of Appeal which is  dated  16  July
    2013.  That order set aside Judge Taylor's determination  and  provided
    at [13] that:

         "In light of the country guidance case of TS (Burma) which has  now
         been promulgated,  the  parties  consider  this  appeal  should  be
         allowed and this case be remitted to the Upper Tribunal to  be  re-
         determined in the light of TS (Burma)."

 2. During a discussion with the representatives at the outset of the Upper
    Tribunal hearing the appellant's representatives agreed  that  (i)  the
    findings of fact of Judge Sarsfield should stand, save that in relation
    to illegal exit from Burma; (ii) the Tribunal should,  as  provided  by
    the consent order, consider that the facts as found in the light of  TS
    (Political opponents - risk) Burma  CG  2013  UKUT  00281  (IAC).   The
    Statement of Reasons annexed to the  consent  order  in  the  Court  of
    Appeal refers to an earlier order of 10 January 2013 (Burnton LJ) which
    recorded  that,  "The  grounds  concerning  the  credibility   of   the
    appellant's  account  of  his  experiences  in  Burma  do  not  justify
    permission to appeal.  The only arguable ground  concerns  his  alleged
    sur place activities."  As regards legal exit, a Statement  of  Reasons
    at [3] records:

         "For the avoidance of doubt, the respondent accepts  the  appellant
         was  an  illegal  entrant  into  the  United  Kingdom  however  the
         respondent does not accept that the  appellant  necessarily  exited
         Burma  illegally,  a  matter  to  be  tested  by  the  fact-finding
         Tribunal."

 3. In his determination  at  [19],  Judge  Sarsfield  made  the  following
    findings (and I summarise): (i) the appellant had never been  a  member
    of the NLD. He had  never been involved with that party  in  Burma  nor
    had he become politically involved with it since arriving in the United
    Kingdom (December 2009); (ii) he did not accept  that  the  appellant's
    colleague, Ko Soe Naing, was an NLD member or had been arrested;  (iii)
    the appellant's account of having been involved  in  demonstrations  in
    Burma was not true the appellant had never been arrested or detained as
    claimed or at all; (iv) the appellant had never  been  served  with  an
    arrest warrant; (v) the judge accepted the  appellant  had  suffered  a
    "cheroot burn" and that his  arm  was  injured  but  found  that  these
    injuries were not the consequence of ill-treatment at the hands of  the
    Burmese authorities as claimed.  At [21] the judge wrote this:

         "I consider this appellant's account  is  not  credible,  does  not
         accord with the background material; he has given contradictory and
         inconsistent evidence and tried to embellish his account; he  is  a
         liar.  I am not satisfied  that  any  injuries  were  sustained  as
         claimed.  I'm not satisfied that he left Burma illegally, has  been
         politically involved and come  to  the  authorities'  attention  or
         comes within the category of returnees at risk in the case law.  If
         returned I am not satisfied he would suffer such ill-treatment that
         would amount  to  persecution,  torture  or  inhuman  or  degrading
         treatment, sufficient for a Convention reason or amount to a breach
         of Articles 2 and 3 of the 1950 Convention."

 4. The appellant gave brief evidence in Burmese with the assistance of  an
    interpreter.  He adopted his three statements of  December  2009,  July
    2011 and September 2013 as his evidence-in-chief.  The  appellant  said
    that he would continue attending political demonstrations in  Burma  as
    he had done in the United Kingdom, "if given the chance."

 5. He was cross-examined by Mr Steward regarding the manner  in  which  he
    had left Burma.  In his witness statement of July 2011,  the  appellant
    described his departure from the country as follows:

         "I can confirm that I got into the back of the  lorry  at  Hlay  Ku
         Town which is in Burma at about 4pm on 9/8/2009 and arrived at  Kaw
         Ka Rait in Burma about 3am on 10/8/2009.  I got out the lorry there
         for a short while and then back into the lorry in the same position
         as before.  We went through the checkpoint at Thingan Nyi Naung  in
         Burma and I would estimate the lorry  was  stopped  for  about  ten
         minutes.  We arrived in Mya Wa Di in Burma where we left the  lorry
         and travelled by motorbike to a small place  where  the  motorbikes
         were left and we took a small boat across the river to Mae  Sot  in
         Thailand.  In this way, we avoided the border controls."

 6. Asked whether the  border  control  had  been  manned  by  soldiers  or
    civilians, the appellant said that he had never seen the border control
    area itself.  He had left the track and had travelled by motorbike  for
    about ten minutes before he crossed the border.  He said  that  he  had
    taken ten minutes by motorcycle to reach the crossing.  He had obtained
    the motorcycle at a bus station in the city centre.  The appellant said
    that the crossing of the river was about 30 fee wide.  Nobody else  had
    crossed with the  appellant.   Asked  whether  he  knew  whether  other
    refugees had used the crossing in the past, the appellant said that  he
    did not know; he added that his uncle had made  all  the  arrangements.
    The appellant had made the crossing at twilight.

 7. The appellant was asked about the demonstrations which he had  attended
    in  the  United  Kingdom  (there  are  photographs  showing  him  at  a
    demonstration in 2011).  The appellant said that he had never been able
    to use the microphone to address  the  other  protesters;  on  the  one
    occasion when he had been given the microphone, "time was up and I  had
    not actually had the time to use it."

 8. The Tribunal reserved its determination.

 9. The burden of proof in the appeal is on the appellant and the  standard
    of proof is whether there would be a real risk that the appellant would
    suffer, respectively, persecution or treatment  contrary  to  the  ECHR
    (Articles 2/3) if he were to return to Burma.  I do not find  that  the
    appellant is a witness of truth.  I do not accept his account of having
    left Burma.  I do not find it  reasonably  likely  that  the  appellant
    would have been able to use the illegal border crossing  into  Thailand
    with such ease and without encountering soldiers,  policemen  or  other
    officials of the Burmese state.  The appellant told me that the  border
    crossing was "an established crossing" although he could not  give  the
    particulars of anyone else who had used it.  If  the  crossing  was  as
    narrow as the appellant claimed (30 feet) then  its  crossing  by  boat
    would be a swift and relatively easy matter and I simply to not accept,
    given the nature of the Burmese regime  and  its  concern  with  ethnic
    conflicts on its borders and incursions from neighbouring  states,  the
    Burmese authorities would not have monitored  such  an  obvious  border
    crossing on territory which it (as opposed  to  rebels  or  insurgents)
    controlled.

10. In reaching that finding, I am aware of the observations of  the  Court
    of Appeal in GM Eritrea [2008] EWCA Civ 833 at [31]:

         Third, the observation in Ariaya and Sammy and in MA that a  person
         who has not given a credible account  of  his  own  history  cannot
         easily show that he would be at risk as a draft evader  or  because
         of illegal exit is, with respect, a robust assessment of  practical
         likelihood, but it is not expressed as, and cannot be, any sort  of
         rule of law or even rule of  thumb.  In  every  case  it  is  still
         necessary to consider, despite the failure of the applicant to help
         himself by giving a true or any account  of  his  own  experiences,
         whether there is a reasonable likelihood of persecution on  return.
         In all of the present cases the appellants argued that the totality
         of  material  before  the  respective  tribunals,  even  though  it
         included almost no contribution  from  the  appellants  themselves,
         required a positive answer to that question. To those  arguments  I
         now turn.

11. In reaching my finding I have had regard to the  appellant's  evidence,
    specifically regarding his exit  including  his  answers  under  cross-
    examination.  My finding is, therefore, a discrete finding although, in
    accordance with best practice, I have assessed the evidence of exit  in
    the context of all the evidence.  I have not ignored the fact that  the
    appellant was found to be an untruthful witness by Judge Sarsfield; his
    finding is clearly insufficient on its own to lead me to a finding that
    the  appellant  has  lied  regarding  his  exit  from  Burma  but   the
    appellant's general lack of  truthfulness  is  the  background  against
    which I have considered the evidence.

12. Mr Steward did not seek to challenge  the  appellant's  claim  to  have
    attended demonstrations in the United Kingdom.  However,  referring  to
    the recent country guidance of TS, he submitted that the appellant  did
    not even reach "the lowest profile of a person likely to be  at  risk."
    In TS, the Tribunal held:

         5.           A person who has a profile of  voicing  opposition  to
         the government in the  United  Kingdom   through  participation  in
         demonstrations or attendance at political  meetings  will  not  for
         this  reason  alone  be  of  sufficient  concern  to  the   Burmese
         authorities to result in detention immediately upon arrival.   This
         is irrespective of whether the  UK  activity  has  been  driven  by
         opportunistic or genuinely held views  and  is  regardless  of  the
         prominence of the profile in this country.

         6.           A person who has a profile of  voicing  opposition  to
         the Burmese government in the  United  Kingdom  can  expect  to  be
         monitored upon return by the Burmese authorities.  The intensity of
         that  monitoring  will  in  general  depend  upon  the  extent   of
         opposition activity abroad.

         7.           Whether there is a real risk that monitoring will lead
         to detention following return will  in  each  case  depend  on  the
         Burmese authorities' view of the information it  already  possesses
         coupled with what it receives as the  result  of  any  post-arrival
         monitoring.  Their view will be shaped by (i) how active the person
         had  been  in  the  United  Kingdom,   for   example   by   leading
         demonstrations or becoming a prominent voice in political meetings,
         (ii) what he/she did before leaving Burma, (iii) what  that  person
         does on return, (iv)the profile of the people he or she mixes  with
         and (v) whether a person is of an ethnicity that  is  seen  by  the
         government to be de-stabilising  the  union,  or  if  the  person's
         activity is of a kind that has an ethnic, geo-political or economic
         regional component, which is regarded by the Burmese government  as
         a sensitive issue.

         8.           It is someone's profile in the eyes of the state  that
         is the key to determining risk.   The  more  the  person  concerned
         maintains an active political profile in  Burma,  post-return,  the
         greater the risk of significant monitoring, carrying with it a real
         risk of detention.

13. With regards to [7] above, this appellant has  not  led  demonstrations
    nor has he become "a prominent voice in political meetings."  Before he
    left Burma, he had no political or opposition profile whatever.  I find
    that when he returns to Burma he will  have  no  intention  at  all  of
    engaging in political activity of any kind;  I  explicitly  reject  his
    claim  under  cross-examination  that  he  would  continue  to   attend
    demonstrations in Burma "if he had the chance."  He is unlikely to  mix
    with individuals who have opposition political  profiles;  he  has  not
    done so in the past and I see absolutely no reason why he should  start
    to do so in the future.  As Mr  O'Ryan  acknowledged,  problems  for  a
    returnee  anticipated  by  TS  essentially  turn  on  the  individual's
    political activity after return to Burma.  I find that this appellant's
    very limited involvement in demonstrations sur place will  not  per  se
    expose him to a risk on return and any risk profile he may  have  as  a
    result of attending those demonstrations will amount to very little  in
    terms of real risk because he has no  interest  in  engaging  political
    opposition in Burma.

14. That leaves the question of the appellant's possible illegal exit  from
    Burma.  As I have recorded above, I do  not  find  the  appellant  left
    Burma as he describes.  I find  it  likely  that  he  has  invented  an
    account in order to avoid giving any details of  how  he  actually  did
    leave Burma.  Had he left Burma illegally, I find  that  the  appellant
    would have had no hesitation in telling the Respondent's  officers  and
    the Tribunal the  truth.   I  consider  it  likely  the  appellant  has
    refrained from giving a true account of his exit because he fears  that
    account may damage his claim for asylum.  I consider it likely that  he
    left Burma legally.  Returning to GM, the Court of Appeal held at  [39-
    40]:

          So far as GM and YT are concerned, their lives are  an  evidential
         blank between 2000 and their arrival in the United Kingdom, in 2006
         in the case of GM and 2005 in the  case  of  YT.  Both  Immigration
         Judges rightly thought that it was not their task to  speculate  as
         to what the appellants had been doing during that  period.  And  in
         any event such enquiry would indeed have been entirely speculative.
         While they are unlikely to have fallen into any of  the  categories
         reported in �9 above, they were of an age to have  moved  into  the
         student category envisaged by the AIT. Since they  put  forward  no
         truthful material about  what  they  were  doing  in  the  relevant
         period, it is in  my  view  impossible  to  say  that  there  is  a
         reasonable  degree  of  likelihood  that  during  that  period  the
         appellants did not move into the student category.

         At the same time, it is equally impossible to say that it is likely
         that they did enter that category. That however is not the test. Mr
         Nicol was wrong in suggesting that it  was  for  the  Secretary  of
         State to produce evidence to that effect. That would indeed  be  to
         reverse the burden of proof. As this court put  it  in  Ariaya  and
         Sammy, cited in  �12  above,  it  may  not  be  necessary  for  the
         appellant in such circumstances  to  say  much,  but  he  must  say
         something, adduce some evidence  that  puts  him  in  a  vulnerable
         position, before the effective burden  of  contradicting  his  case
         passes to the Secretary of State.

15. Having rejected the appellant's account of his departure, the  Tribunal
    has before it an appellant who has given an untruthful account of  past
    events in Burma and whose sur place activities do not expose him  to  a
    real risk on return.  I find that the appellant has failed to discharge
    the  burden  of  proving,  even  to  the  low  standard  of  reasonable
    likelihood, that he is likely to be in  a  "vulnerable  position"  upon
    return to Burma.

16. Mr O'Ryan made the point that the appellant has not been shown to be in
    possession of a valid or expired  Burmese  passport.   There  has  been
    little, if any, evidence regarding any attempt which he may  have  made
    to obtain a genuine passport.  However, I do not consider that this  is
    a case where it is appropriate for the Tribunal to consider  the  exact
    logistics of the appellant's return to his home country.  I assume that
    steps will be taken by the respondent to obtain  a  laissez  passer  or
    other travel document and there is no evidence  to  show  that,  simply
    because a returnee enters Burma in possession of such  a  document,  he
    will be assumed by the Burmese authorities to  have  left  the  country
    illegally.  If problems do occur  once  removal  directions  have  been
    issued, then the appellant may need to seek a remedy by way of judicial
    review.  However, that is not a matter for this Tribunal at the present
    time.

DECISION

17. This appeal is dismissed on asylum grounds.

18. This appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.

19. This appellant is not entitled to a grant of humanitarian protection.
