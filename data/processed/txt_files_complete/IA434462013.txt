Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Diwnycz, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Saleem, Halliday Reeves, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Fawad Ahmed, was born on 16 April 1984 and  is  a  male
    citizen of Pakistan.  I shall hereafter refer to the respondent as  the
    appellant and to the Secretary of State for the Home Department as  the
    respondent (as they were respectively before the First-tier Tribunal).

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 13 February 2011 with entry
    clearance as a Tier 4 Student.  His leave was extended  on  application
    until 13 February 2013.  The appellant then applied for leave to remain
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and Article 8  ECHR  on  the
    basis of his relationship by marriage to  a  British  citizen  (Melanie
    Booth).  Ms Booth has two children by a previous relationship  who  are
    aged 17 and 13 years respectively.  She and the appellant were  married
    in an Islamic ceremony in October 2012 and by way of a  civil  ceremony
    at Doncaster Register Office on 30 January 2013.

 3. By a  decision  dated  4  October  2013,  the  respondent  refused  the
    appellant's application.  The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Robson) which, in a  determination  promulgated  on  14
    March 2014, dismissed  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    allowed the appeal on human  rights  grounds  (Article  8  ECHR).   The
    respondent now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 4. The respondent submits that the judge failed to follow the guidance  of
    Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640.  At
    [59], having found the appellant did not qualify under the  Immigration
    Rules for a grant of leave stated:

    I now consider the position of the appellant under  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights  particularly  in  the  context  of
    Razgar and the five step approach in this matter.

 5. The grounds assert  that  the  determination  "fails  to  establish  an
    arguably good basis for departing from those findings  made  under  the
    Rules and the circumstances subsequently outlined  (and  summarised  in
    [62]) do not disclose insurmountable obstacles".

 6. The judge was clearly aware of Gulshan because he mentions the case  at
    [33] when recounting the submissions made by  the  Presenting  Officer.
    It is, however, unclear why the judge then set out on a  "freewheeling"
    assessment of Article 8 outside the Rules.  The appellant did not  meet
    the Immigration Rules (which now provide a  complete  code  as  regards
    Article 8 - see MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192).  The appellant  had
    not lived continuously in the United Kingdom for at least twenty  years
    whilst the sponsor and the appellant are unable to meet  the  financial
    requirements (the sponsor earns about ï¿½15,874 gross per annum).   There
    is no suggestion in the determination that  the  judge  has  considered
    whether compelling or unusual circumstances were present in this  case;
    he has simply dismissed the Immigration  Rules  appeal  and  has  then,
    acting as if he were required to do so, he has considered the appeal on
    Article 8 ECHR grounds outside  the  Rules.   The  consequence  of  his
    adopting this approach is that  he  has  ignored  the  failure  of  the
    appellant to satisfy the Immigration  Rules  and  has  not  taken  that
    failure (and the reasons for it)  as  a  starting  point  for  deciding
    whether to consider Article 8 outside the Rules at all.

 7. I find the judge's Article 8 assessment is, in any event, flawed.   The
    judge found that the appellant, Ms Booth and the children had formed  a
    family unit and that the "younger child treats  [the  appellant]  as  a
    father figure so as to  maintain  family  life".   The  judge  did  not
    consider it a "realistic or practical proposal" for family life  to  be
    continued in Pakistan.  At [67], the judge found that,

         the longer the relationship continued (between the appellant and Ms
         Booth] particularly with  the  children  the  more  unrealistic  it
         became for the parties to contemplate  the  removal  of  the  whole
         family to Pakistan on the one hand or of the appellant returning on
         his own and seeking to reapply an  application  (sic)  which  would
         take  a  considerable  period  of  time  and  is  not   necessarily
         guaranteed.

 8. One can only assume that the judge has proceeded from his dismissal  of
    the Immigration Rules appeal to considering Article 8 outside the Rules
    because the appellant happens to be in a relationship with a woman  who
    has two children.  Can that properly be said to be a  circumstance  not
    anticipated by the Immigration Rules?  I think not.  The  circumstances
    of the appellant are hardly unusual.  Further, the judge  has  attached
    too much weight to the wishes  of  the  appellant,  Ms  Booth  and  the
    children; it is not clear to me why weight should be  attached  to  the
    fact, as found by the judge, that, as  time  passed,  it  became  "more
    unrealistic ... for the parties to contemplate removal of the family to
    Pakistan ..." There was also no evidence at all before the  judge  that
    it would "take a considerable period of time" for the appellant to make
    an out of country application for entry clearance.  Likewise, the  fact
    that the outcome of that application was "not  necessarily  guaranteed"
    is  an  inadequate  reason,  in   the   absence   of   any   compelling
    circumstances, for allowing an in-country  appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds.

 9. In the light of these observations, I set aside the  determination  and
    remake the decision.

10. I have returned to the agreed position  that  the  appellant  fails  to
    satisfy the Immigration Rules.  For the reasons which I  have  examined
    above, whilst I have no doubt that the  appellant,  Ms  Booth  and  her
    children are engaged in a genuine relationship, their circumstances are
    neither unusual nor compelling nor can they be said to fall outside the
    detailed provisions of the Rules.  There is, in my opinion, no need for
    the Tribunal to go on to consider Article 8 outside the Rules  in  this
    instance.  Accordingly, the appeal against the immigration decision  is
    dismissed.

DECISION

11. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    14 March 2014 is set aside.  I have remade the decision.   This  appeal
    is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.
