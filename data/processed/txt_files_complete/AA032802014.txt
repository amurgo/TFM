Representation:
For the Appellant: Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Ms A Mohsin, instructed by Marks & Marks Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    Whilst this is an appeal by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
   Department,  for  convenience  I  will  refer  to  the  parties  in   the
   determination as they appeared before the First-tier Tribunal

2.     The appellant, a national of Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal against a decision made by the Secretary of State to refuse  her
   application for asylum and to remove her from the UK. Judge of the First-
   tier Tribunal Beach allowed the appeal and the  Secretary  of  State  now
   appeals with leave to this Tribunal.

3.    The appellant's three sons (born in  2000,  2002  and  2006)  are  her
   dependants for the purposes  of  this  appeal.   The  appellant  and  her
   children are all nationals of Pakistan. The appellant claims that she ran
   a construction business and beauty salons in Pakistan.  She  claims  that
   after her third child was born her in-laws  said  that  he  was  not  her
   husband's son and her brother-in-law assaulted  her  twice  and  she  was
   threatened by her in-laws on a number of occasions. She claims  that  she
   was threatened and told that she had to choose between her  property  and
   her children. The appellant came to the UK in 2010 and claimed asylum  on
   5 August 2013.

4.    The Judge found  the  appellant's  claim  to  be  credible  and  these
   findings are  not  challenged  by  the  Secretary  of  State.  The  Judge
   summarised the factual findings at paragraph 53 as follows;

           "I find therefore that the Appellant's in laws were unhappy with
           her independent lifestyle, were unhappy at the breakdown of  the
           marriage and believed that she  had  brought  dishonour  on  the
           family as a result of her meetings with men as part of her work.
           I further find that the Appellant's in laws wished to obtain the
           property owned by the Appellant which the Appellant, as  is  her
           right, refuses to hand over. I further find that  the  Appellant
           has suffered threats and attacks by her brothers in law and that
           it is likely  such  threats  would  continue  of  the  Appellant
           returned to  Pakistan  not  only  because  she  still  owns  the
           property but because of the perceived dishonour she has  brought
           to the family."

5.    The Judge considered the  country  guidance  case  of  KA  and  Others
   (domestic violence - risk on return) Pakistan CG [2010]  UKUT  216  (IAC)
   and decided that there would not be adequate protection for the appellant
   in Pakistan and it would not be reasonable to expect her to relocate.  In
   so finding the Judge noted that whilst the  appellant  had  reported  the
   threats from her brothers-in-law to the police, they did not provide  her
   with any protection and told her that it was a family  problem  and  they
   could not therefore assist. The Judge concluded at paragraph 54 that  the
   appellant's experience with the police was "in line with  the  background
   evidence which strongly suggests that women find it  very  hard  to  seek
   protection or redress from the police or the judicial system in Pakistan.
   I find that there is  a  real  risk  that  the  Appellant  would  not  be
   adequately protected if she returned to Pakistan."

Error of law

6.   The issue in dispute in this  appeal  is  whether  the  Judge  properly
   applied the country guidance in assessing  whether  the  appellant  could
   relocate within Pakistan. The grounds of appeal contend  that  the  Judge
   erred in failing to apply the guidance set out in  head  note  vi  of  KA
   which states;

      "vi. The guidance given in SN and HM (Divorced women - risk on return)
      Pakistan CG [2004] UKIAT 00283 and FS (Domestic violence - SN and HM -
      OGN) Pakistan CG [2006] UKIAT 00023 remains valid.  The  network  of
      women's shelters (comprising government-run shelters (Darul Amans) and
      private  and  Islamic  women's  crisis  centres)  in  general  affords
      effective protection for women victims of domestic violence,  although
      there are significant  shortcomings  in  the  level  of  services  and
      treatment of inmates in some such centres. Women with boys over 5 face
      separation from their sons."

7.   In SN & HM (Divorced women - risk on return) Pakistan CG  [2004]  UKIAT
   00283, which was approved in KA, the Tribunal set out the approach to  be
   taken by Judge's in considering  cases  involving  domestic  violence  in
   Pakistan  at paragraph 48;

      "48. The same [April 2004] CIPU Country Report accepts  that  internal
      flight options are limited for women, but it does not state that there
      are no internal flight possibilities and each case will depend on  its
      own particular factual matrix. We find that some support is  available
      in the cities, and we also consider the geographical scale of Pakistan
      (covering an area of about 307,374 square miles, with a population  of
      140,470,000); the question of internal  flight  will  require  careful
      consideration in each case. The general questions  which  Adjudicators
      should ask themselves in cases of this kind are as follows -


                   (a)Has the claimant shown a real risk or reasonable
                   likelihood of continuing hostility from her husband (or
                   former husband) or his family members, such as to raise a
                   real risk of serious harm in her former home area?

                   (b)If yes, has she shown that she would have no effective
                   protection in her home area against such a risk,
                   including protection available from the Pakistani state,
                   from her own family members, or from a current partner or
                   his family?

                   (c) If yes, would such a risk and lack of protection
                   extend to any other part of Pakistan to which she could
                   reasonably be expected to go ...having regard to the
                   available state support, shelters, crisis centres, and
                   family members or friends in other parts of Pakistan?"


8.     In  this  case  the  Judge  answered  the  first  question   in   the
   affirmative.  The  Judge  also  answered  the  second  question  in   the
   affirmative based on the appellant's experience of the police response to
   her reporting the threats made by her brothers in  law.  I  am  satisfied
   that such a finding was open  to  the  Judge  based  on  the  appellant's
   evidence and the background evidence set out in KA and the other  country
   guidance cases.

9.    The Judge  then  considered  the  third  question,  that  of  internal
   relocation [55]. The Judge said that the appellant had relocated  in  the
   past to the extent that  she  lived  with  her  sister  in  accommodation
   arranged by her father in Lahore and returned to her  father's  house  in
   Shagragar but that her in  laws  tracked  her  down  to  each  place  and
   attacked her at her sister's accommodation and threatened her in her  car
   when she was at her father's house. The Judge did not find  credible  the
   appellant's evidence that her father would not continue to support her if
   she returned  to  Pakistan  but  noted  that  this  support  amounted  to
   financial support for accommodation rather than support within the family
   home. The Judge found that this might afford the appellant  accommodation
   paid for by her father but said that this is not the only issue as 'there
   is societal prejudice towards single women in Pakistan and I find that it
   would not be reasonable to expect the appellant to  relocate  to  another
   area of Pakistan. She has already  faced  problems  both  in  Lahore  and
   Shagragar and I find that of she returned to these areas she ruins a real
   risk of being targeted by her in laws.  If  she  relocated  elsewhere  in
   Pakistan she would, in effect, be alone, which would be likely  to  cause
   considerable distress and difficulties given  the  societal  attitude  to
   divorced or single women in Pakistan.'

10. Ms Everett submitted that the Judge did not give  adequate  reasons  for
   her findings in  relation  to  internal  relocation  and  submitted  that
   societal prejudice is not  enough  and  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to
   consider the fact that the appellant's father had previously paid for her
   accommodation.

11. Ms Mohsin submitted that it is clear from reading the  determination  as
   a whole that the Judge had in mind the property dispute and  the  threats
   to the appellant's children. She said  that  the  Judge  must  also  have
   considered that the appellant would be returning with her  children.  She
   also submitted that the Judge cited the 2013 COI Report which was  issued
   subsequent to KA which quotes the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan  as
   saying that 'it is next to impossible for a single woman in Pakistan  die
   to prejudices against women and  economic  dependants'  55].  However  Ms
   Everett submitted that in order to depart from KA the Judge  should  have
   provided a full extract, she submitted that this is incomplete and it  is
   not clear where in the COI Report it is from.

12. I have looked at the Pakistan COI Report of 9 August  2013  and  I  note
   that the Judge's quote was inaccurate. The full relevant  extract  is  as
   follows;

           "Single women
      23.96 The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada  (IRB)  noted  in  a
      response by its
      Research Directorate, dated 14 January  2013,  that,  according  to  a
      representative from the Human Rights  Commission  of  Pakistan  (HRCP)
      '... it is "next to impossible" for a single woman to  live  alone  in
      Pakistan due to prejudices against  women  and  economic  dependence.'
      [12u] (5. Shelters)


      23.97 In a response dated 17 November 2010, the IRB noted that:
      'For women to live alone and unmarried in Pakistan, it will depend  on
      which province and in what  context  they  are  living,  reported  the
      Metropolitan  State  College  of  Denver  Assistant  Professor...  The
      Assistant Professor explained that, socio-economically,
      "Pakistan has [a] very sharp  rural  and  urban  divide"..  'Rural  is
      collectivist, community/village  based,  agrarian,  traditional,  more
      illiterate and poor. Women are not recognized as an individual  member
      of the community, they are members  of  their  male-dominated  family.
      Woman's life in the village context is a matter of concern  for  every
      man  of  the  neighborhood  community.  There  is  no  concept  of  an
      "unattached" woman. She has to live with her family. What  do  widows,
      divorced or spinsters do? They live with  their  parental  or  in-laws
      family. Older women with grown up children normally  depend  on  their
      sons or daughters. There are always exceptions to their situations  in
      the rural context but generally it is not socially safe and acceptable
      for [single] women to live in the rural context.
      'Urban is semi-collectivist and individualistic, more  literate,  with
      better infrastructure and transportation facilities and plenty of  job
      opportunities i.e. skilled or unskilled. Urban is different but  still
      there are difficulties for single  women.  Here,  class  is  the  main
      determinant of woman's choices for  her  life  style.  In  big  cities
      educated women with jobs or some property income would not  have  much
      difficulty to live alone...
      'The Law Professor also said that "[i]t all depends on  who  you  are,
      what resources you have, which part of  the  country  you  come  from,
      [and] what your own  educational  and  economic,  professional  status
      is"..' [12r]


      23.98 The IRB added, on the  degree  of  independence  experienced  by
      women living in
      Pakistan, that:
      'Both the Assistant Professor and the  Law  Professor  said  that  the
      ability of women to act independently differs depending on their level
      of education ...  For  example,  the  Assistant  Professor  said  that
      "[e]ducated urban, upper/middle class working women or  housewives  do
      not find it difficult to rent an apartment or to open a  bank  account
      or travel domestically or internationally. Women in  the  rural  areas
      normally do not rent a house or  any  other  place.  Due  to  lack  of
      education, they are normally accompanie[d] by a male member to open an
      account or to do other things in public sphere."...
      'The Law Professor also indicated that, although  there  are  no  laws
      preventing a woman to open her own bank account, "it depends [on]  who
      that woman is," whether she's literate, has  her  own  identification,
      and can travel alone... As the Professor explained, This is more to do
      with access rather than the law or society. If a  professional  woman,
      earning good money went to rent an apartment,  no  one  would  bat  an
      eyelid. [B]ut that is because her  sense  of  autonomy  and  authority
      would make her able to do so...' [12r]


      23.99 The same source added on the treatment of single women:
      'The Assistant Professor reported that a woman living alone in a rural
      area is an "exceptional situation" that "is not liked by her family or
      community"...  However,  the  Assistant  Professor  allowed  that  the
      woman's age should be taken into consideration... If she is  an  older
      woman, in her 70s or 80s, it would  not  be  a  big  problem  in  both
      contexts, rural and urban or in any class. A young  or  a  middle  age
      woman finds it hard to live alone in all of these contexts.  All  kind
      [of] gossips surround her and she is watched  by  everyone  for  every
      move she makes...
      'The Law Professor stated that the absence of a male relative may make
      a woman "vulnerable" and added  that  "the  worsening  law  and  order
      situation" has made Pakistan  "a  generally  unsafe  place  to  be"...
      Younger women risk attracting "unwanted  attention  from  men";  older
      women may find themselves taken advantage of by their  helpers...  The
      Assistant Professor also said that a woman "[l]iving alone in majority
      of the contexts such as rural (which is about  70%  of  Pakistan)  and
      lower/middle class urban" would put herself at "risk  for  her  safety
      and security"... The Law Professor likewise said that any  attempt  to
      break away from her family "might pose a danger" to the safety of even
      "a resourceful woman"...' [12r]


      23.100 The IRB put into context the regional differences with  regards
      to single women, which stated:
      'In  a  follow-up  to  initial  correspondence   with   the   Research
      Directorate, the Assistant Professor explained that of Pakistan's four
      provinces-Sindh, Punjab,  Balochistan  and  Khayber  Pakhtunkhah  (KP)
      (formerly the North-West Frontier Province [NWFP]) - the urban centres
      in Punjab and Sindh are "more educated and liberal"  while  cities  in
      Balochistan and KP have a "very  conservative  culture.  It  would  be
      easier for an educated single woman to live alone in Karachi or Lahore
      but not in Peshawar or Quetta"... The Assistant Professor  added  that
      [s]ocial and physical mobility of single women in Pakistan is  not  an
      easy thing. An educated woman working in multinational  [organisation]
      may move easily from Karachi to Lahore  or  Islamabad  (capital  city)
      [but] not to the rural areas or to  the  smaller  cities.  If  she  is
      hiding from her family or her husband, it would be much difficult  for
      her do that...
      'Similarly,  the  Law  Professor  said  that  "maybe"  an   "educated,
      professional woman," with "resources," could relocate and  live  alone
      in a city... But, the Law Professor cautioned, if  she  is  young  and
      does not have a male relative, it would be "difficult"...' [12r]

13. Whilst some of this evidence does post-date KA I am  satisfied  that  it
   is consistent with  the  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  in  KA.  Having
   considered all of the evidence the Tribunal in KA concluded;

           "269. The appellant now says in her most recent witness
           statement and in evidence to us that her father no longer has
           property or assets and faces expensive medical treatment and
           would not be able to assist as before, something she repeated
           before us. We consider this inconsistent with her earlier
           evidence that her father had sold only some of his property and
           gold to help her leave the country; and in our judgment she has
           not adequately explained how it has come about that she can say
           he no longer has any other property or any gold. In any event,
           it remains, even on her own latest account, that he has a
           pension following retirement from employment in the professional
           sector and she has not suggested that the family's standard of
           living has declined. We also know that the appellant has three
           sets of relatives, none of whom are said to be poor or to have
           expressly turned their back on her. Given the lengths to which
           her father and mother went to before to assist her we do not
           consider that they would leave her to relocate elsewhere in
           Pakistan without any kind of family assistance, whether in the
           form of financial or other assistance. Even though the
           appellant's level of education is modest, it is still above that
           of many women in the larger cities and she (although she chose
           to give evidence before us through an interpreter) speaks
           English. We agree with Dr Shah that this would be an asset for
           some employers in the big cities. She would, of course, have two
           young children and so if she were to work would need help with
           their care during the day, but it seems clear that such help is
           available at a low cost.


           270. The appellant says that she fears social isolation and
           disgrace. The expert and background evidence highlights the
           damage done to women's reputation by being made the subject of
           FIRs relating to adultery allegations and being detained in
           police custody. We do not seek to belittle the difficulties the
           appellant will face in her home area as a result of her
           husband's past vendetta against her and his likely continued
           pursuit of her through the courts, but we do not consider that
           in other parts of Pakistan her history would become known or
           that she would need to make it known to those she associated
           with. It is clear from the background evidence that in the
           larger cities single women with children can get by and there is
           not the same level of social scrutiny that occurs in the smaller
           towns and rural areas."

14. The appellant in this case has the financial support of her father.  She
   is not someone who would have to recourse to a shelter and could, on  the
   Judge's findings, obtain accommodation elsewhere in  Pakistan.  The  only
   reason given by  the  Judge  for  the  decision  that  it  would  not  be
   reasonable to relocate was that she would be alone and which would  cause
   her considerable distress and difficulties 'given the  societal  attitude
   to divorced or single women in Pakistan' [55]. She did not highlight  any
   issues particular to this case which Ms Mohsin submitted made  this  case
   different. The Judge, at the end, only relied on societal attitudes.  The
   decision in KA is clear on this issue and I am satisfied that  the  Judge
   erred in not properly considering the guidance in KA and  in  not  giving
   reasons for not following that decision. I am satisfied that  this  is  a
   material error and I therefore set aside the decision of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal. There has been no challenge to the credibility findings  and  I
   preserve all of the findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge in relation
   to credibility and sufficiency of protection.

Remaking the decision

Asylum

15. I go on to remake the  decision  in  relation  to  the  internal  flight
   option. That is the third question posed in SN and HM  which  is  whether
   the risk and lack of protection in the appellant's home area  extends  to
   any other part of Pakistan to which she could reasonably be  expected  to
   go having  regard  to  the  available  state  support,  shelters,  crisis
   centres, and family members or friends in other parts of Pakistan.

16.  Ms  Everett  submitted  that  this  appellant  worked  successfully  in
   Pakistan in the past. She submitted that her  father  would  support  her
   financially so the appellant could  work  and  would  have  her  father's
   financial support. She submitted  that  there  is  no  finding  that  the
   appellant could be traced elsewhere  in  Pakistan  or  that  her  in-laws
   continue to have an interest in the children.

17. Ms Mohsin submitted that it  is  clear  on  the  facts  found  that  the
   appellant's children are relevant. She also submitted that  the  property
   dispute is also relevant in the context of the  amount  of  property  the
   appellant's in-laws are after. However according to the appellant's  oral
   evidence [17] the property has been passed to her in-laws  although  they
   do not have the original documents. In her  witness  statement  she  said
   that two of her properties had been transferred  to  her  brothers-in-law
   (paragraph 12).

18. Ms Mohsin submitted that in KA there was no  issue  of  custody  of  the
   children. However the appellant's oral evidence in this case was that  in
   2009 her in-laws told her that she  would  have  to  choose  between  her
   property and her children. The Judge found that the appellant was granted
   custody of the children  [50].  As  her  in-laws  now  have  two  of  her
   properties there is no evidence  that  they  will  seek  custody  of  the
   children.

19. Ms Mohsin also submitted that the appellant faces  separation  from  her
   sons as set out in the head note of KA. However the position taken by the
   Tribunal is not as simple as it appears from the head note. The detail of
   this part of the decision is set out at paragraphs 241 and 242 of  KA  as
   follows;


           241. Another important variable concerns women who have male
           children over five. From the Safe to Return? research, taken
           together with other materials, we are satisfied that women with
           boys over five may not be able to find a centre or refuge that
           will allow them to live together; the boys above this age are
           placed in orphanages or madrassahs in the area. As described by
           the Safe to Return? report:


                     "[O]n admittance the mother is informed of this policy
                     and has to then make a choice of being with her sons or
                     accepting a place at the shelter. If the woman chooses
                     to enter the shelter her sons are referred to the local
                     madrassas or orphanages. This practice has not taken
                     into consideration the impact this has on the children
                     who may have been a witness to the violence. Apart from
                     the trauma of separation from their mother the children
                     may have specific psychological needs because of their
                     previous experiences in their homes".


           242. We do not say that such arrangements are necessarily to be
           seen as making the mother and her son's relocation unreasonable,
           only that this may be a factor which has considerable
           significance when considering the reasonableness of internal
           relocation.

20. The Judge found that the appellant's father would  continue  to  provide
   her with financial support for  accommodation.  Also,  according  to  her
   statement, the appellant continues  to  receive  around  �300  per  month
   rental income from Pakistan. She  also  says  that  she  owns  assets  in
   Pakistan including two properties with a  combined  value  of  more  than
   �140,000. The appellant would not therefore need to have  recourse  to  a
   shelter and there would therefore be no risk of separation from her  sons
   in this way.

21. In her oral evidence the appellant said  that  in  Pakistan  she  ran  a
   construction business, an interior design business, dealt in property and
   ran beauty salons [23]. The Judge was satisfied on the evidence that  the
   appellant had worked for a building company  but  found  that  there  was
   insufficient evidence to show that the appellant owned  the  business  or
   that she owned a beauty salon. According to her statement  she  regularly
   travelled to the UK on holiday, often more than  once  a  year,  and  her
   children were in private education. Even  on  the  Judge's  findings  the
   appellant was able to work and, if she relocates, she could do so  again.
   She has means and could support herself and her children.  The  appellant
   has the skills and experience to gain employment and support herself  and
   her children.

22. There is no evidence that the appellant's in-laws  have  such  influence
   and reach that they could trace her wherever she goes in Pakistan. On the
   evidence before me the appellant has not shown that it  would  be  unduly
   harsh to expect her to relocate in Pakistan where she would  not  face  a
   risk of persecution.

Article 8

23. The appellant claims to be in a relationship  with  a  man  in  the  UK.
   There is no statement from her  claimed  partner  and  he  did  not  give
   evidence in the First-tier Tribunal. I have before me bank statements,  a
   tenancy agreement and some utility bills. However in light of the limited
   evidence before me I am not satisfied that the appellant is married to or
   has been living with a British citizen, a person settled in the UK  or  a
   refugee for a  period  of  two  years.  She  cannot  therefore  meet  the
   requirements of Gen 1.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC395 as
   amended).

24.  The appellant does not meet the requirements of Appendix FM  for  leave
   to remain as a parent as her children are not British  citizens,  settled
   in the UK or resident in the UK for 7 years. The  appellant  cannot  meet
   the requirements of the Immigration Rules in relation to private life  as
   she has been in the UK only since 2010 and has not shown that there would
   be very significant obstacles to her integration into Pakistan.

25. The Immigration  Act  2014  amended  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
   Asylum Act 2002 by providing for factors to be considered by  a  Tribunal
   in assessing the public interest in deciding whether an interference with
   a person's right to respect to private and family life is justified under
   Article 8 (2) of the ECHR.

26. Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  as
   inserted  by  the  Immigration  Act  2014  sets   out   public   interest
   considerations as follows;


      (1)The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the  public
      interest.
      (2)It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
      the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons  who  seek
      to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able  to  speak  English,
      because persons who can speak English-
           (a)are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b)are better able to integrate into society.
      (3)It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
      the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons  who  seek
      to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially  independent,
      because such persons-
           (a)are not a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b)are better able to integrate into society.
      (4)Little weight should be given to-
           (a)a private life, or
           (b)a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
      that is established by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the
      United Kingdom unlawfully.
      (5)Little weight should be given to a private life  established  by  a
      person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.
      (6)In the case of a person who  is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
      public interest does not require the person's removal where-
           (a)the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
           with a qualifying child, and
           (b)it would not be reasonable to expect the child to  leave  the
           United Kingdom.

27. There is no evidence before me that the  appellant  can  speak  English,
   that she is financially independent, or that her claimed relationship was
   not formed when she was in the UK  unlawfully  or  at  a  time  when  her
   immigration status was  precarious.  The  appellant's  children  are  not
   'qualifying' children as they are not British citizens and they have  not
   resided in the UK for 7 years.

28. I take account of the best interests of the children. There  is  limited
   evidence before me as to the children. I can only conclude on  the  basis
   of the evidence before me that it must be in their best interests  to  be
   with their mother.

29. I have considered the decision in Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -
   correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) where the Tribunal  examined  the
   case law and concluded [24]; "after  applying  the  requirements  of  the
   rules, only if there may arguably be good grounds for granting leave  to
   remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to  go  on  to
   consider whether there  are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
   recognised under them".

30. In light of my findings above I am satisfied that there  is  nothing  in
   this case to show that there may be arguably good  grounds  for  granting
   leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules and  it  is  not  therefore
   necessary for me to go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
   circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules.

Conclusion:

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of  an  error
on a point of law.

I set aside the decision

I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it


Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008).


Signed
