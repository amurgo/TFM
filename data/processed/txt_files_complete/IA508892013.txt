Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is an Indian national born on 8th March 1980.

 2. On 28th November 2013 a decision was made by the Respondent  to  refuse
    to vary leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  to  remove  the
    Appellant by way of directions under Section  47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The Appellant has exercised his right
    of appeal under Section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The Appellant's immigration history shows that  he  first  entered  the
    United Kingdom on 10th September 2007 with valid entry clearance  as  a
    student.  Two years later he was granted leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
    (Post-Study Work) Migrant and on 21st September  2011  he  was  granted
    leave to remain for a further two years as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant.
    He was interviewed in connection with his present  application  on  5th
    November 2013.

 4. The appeal was heard  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Beg  at
    Richmond on 30th May 2014 and dismissed in a determination  promulgated
    on 13th June 2014.  Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Heynes on 4th July 2014.  The Grounds of Appeal are described by  Judge
    Heynes as being poorly drafted but the judge considered that  they  may
    be construed as a complaint that the First-tier Judge  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons.  Judge Heynes noted that the determination  does  not
    include any finding as to whether the Appellant did or did not meet the
    requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules;  only  that  it  (i.e.   the
    Respondent's decision) was in accordance with the law.

 5. Thus the matter came before me in the Upper Tribunal on  10th  November
    2014.  Representation was as mentioned above.  I had before me all  the
    documents which were before the First-tier Tribunal.  In addition I had
    the benefit of a skeleton argument drafted by Mr Lawrence,  a  copy  of
    the  Upper  Tribunal's  determination  in  Ahmed  and   Another   (PBS:
    admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 365 and a copy of Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 6. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision on the  error  of  law
    issue which I now give with my reasons.

 7. The Respondent's reasons for refusing the Appellant's  application  for
    further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant under the points-
    based system (PBS) are set out  in  a  seven  page  letter  dated  28th
    November 2013.  With due respect to the Respondent's representative who
    drafted that letter, it is not an easy document with which to  grapple.
    In fact I had to read it several times before fully  understanding  the
    reasons which were being put forward in support of the  refusal.   That
    is possibly due, at least in part, to the fact that the letter  records
    verbatim extracts from the  Appellant's  interview.   The  standard  of
    English is regrettably poor which makes the whole thing very  difficult
    to understand.  However, in summary, the  Respondent  appears  to  have
    concluded that the Appellant's claimed method  of  doing  business  and
    providing services was neither plausible nor credible.  The  Respondent
    concluded that the Appellant was not the owner of Antech Solutions Ltd,
    a company which he claimed to own, because records at  Companies  House
    showed that the company name belonged to someone  else.   It  was  also
    considered that the fees charged by the Appellant  were  excessive  and
    unrealistic.  The Respondent found it not plausible that the  Appellant
    would design a website for a client without knowing the nature  of  the
    business in which the client's company  was  involved.   Secondly,  the
    client was himself a designer but the Appellant nevertheless claimed to
    have charged him ï¿½3,000 for something which  he  could  have  done  for
    himself.  Finally, the Respondent appears  to  have  drawn  an  adverse
    inference from  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  did  not  provide  his
    customers with a certificate at the end of the training course which he
    claims to have provided.

 8. I find that the First-tier Judge's determination is far from clear.  In
    addressing the Respondent's reasons for refusal, the  First-tier  Judge
    has simply quoted verbatim  a  substantial  part  of  the  Respondent's
    refusal letter.   This  takes  up  no  less  than  four  pages  of  the
    determination which is only eight pages in length in its entirety.  The
    judge has made a number of findings at paragraphs  8  to  14  inclusive
    which  are  interspersed  between  references  to  the   evidence   and
    submissions.  The  judge  concludes  by  stating  "In  considering  the
    evidence as a whole and on a balance of probabilities, I find that  the
    Respondent's decision is in accordance with the  law".   The  reasoning
    behind this conclusion is, I regret to say, difficult to follow  and  I
    agree with Judge Heynes (who granted permission to  appeal),  that  the
    determination does not include any findings as to whether the Appellant
    did or did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 9. I have to say that I  have  some  sympathy  for  the  First-tier  Judge
    because many of the  documents  placed  before  her  were  not  readily
    understandable.  I would refer in particular  to  the  Appellant's  own
    witness statement dated 26th May 2014.  For someone who claims to  have
    a MSc degree in mobile computer systems from Staffordshire  University,
    the standard of English is remarkably poor and the statement is, in  my
    view, difficult to follow.

10. I have been assisted by the skeleton argument submitted by Mr  Lawrence
    for the error of law hearing.  He makes a number of points  which  are,
    thankfully, readily  understandable.   Mr  Lawrence's  arguments  refer
    specifically to paragraphs 8 and 9 of  Judge  Beg's  determination.   A
    section of paragraph 8 has been quoted verbatim.  This is the  part  of
    the determination where the judge records that Antech Solutions Ltd  is
    not the Appellant's company as the company belongs to someone  else  as
    recorded by Companies House.  Mr Lawrence argues that this  is  a  bare
    assertion by the Respondent which has been repeated and adopted by  the
    First-tier Judge.  It is argued  that  the  Respondent  ought  to  have
    disclosed the "someone  else"  who  is  said  to  own  the  company  in
    question.  In the absence of disclosure the Appellant is prevented from
    properly meeting the issue raised and prosecuting his appeal.

11. The next point refers to the Respondent's assertion in the reasons  for
    refusal that "the only thing on that website to show that  it  possibly
    belongs to you is the contact page which  appears  to  show  your  home
    address".  It is submitted that the First-tier Judge did not deal  with
    this point in her determination.  It  is  further  submitted  that  the
    words "possibly" and "appears" are value judgments and not the  anxious
    scrutiny of the evidence which is required.

12. With reference to paragraph 9, Mr Lawrence submits that the  First-tier
    Judge erred in  finding  that  an  invoice  addressed  to  one  of  the
    Appellant's claimed  customers  required  corroboration.   Mr  Lawrence
    correctly argues that corroboration is not required as a matter of  law
    or practice.  The perceived lack  of  it  should  not  have  led  to  a
    negative finding.  Instead, the First-tier Judge should have looked  at
    the evidence in the round and applied the civil standard  to  ascertain
    whether or not the Appellant had discharged the burden of proof.

13. At paragraph 13 there is a reference  to  "conclusive  evidence".   The
    grounds submit that this suggests that the First-tier Judge applied the
    wrong standard of proof.  The civil standard, which  applies  in  these
    proceedings, does not require  conclusive  evidence.   The  test  is  a
    balance of probabilities.

14. Finally, it is argued that the First-tier  Judge  has  raised  a  fresh
    issue at paragraph 14 of the determination.  The judge found that there
    was no documentary evidence from HM Revenue and Customs.  In  the  Rule
    24 response, the Respondent  asserts  that  documents  from  HMRC  were
    before the First-tier Judge.  It is submitted that they were  not.   It
    is submitted that the Respondent did not carefully consider the  bundle
    submitted with the application, or  to  the  First-tier  Judge  at  the
    appeal hearing.

15. In conclusion, the grounds submit that the First-tier Judge  failed  to
    consider the evidence in the round and that negative findings were  not
    evidence based.

16. In oral submissions, Miss Johnstone relied on the guidance given by the
    Upper Tribunal in Ahmed which is referred  to  above.   Miss  Johnstone
    also argued that at no point in the Appellant's witness  statement  did
    he claim that his company is not a certificate awarding body, therefore
    it is not open to him to rely on that  argument  now.   Miss  Johnstone
    submitted that it is not for the Upper Tribunal to re-make the decision
    on  evidence  which  was  not  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   She
    submitted that the First-tier Judge has made  clear  findings  for  not
    accepting that the Appellant's case was credible.

17. This is by no means an easy matter to resolve,  but  I  have  concluded
    that the First-tier Judge's determination does not demonstrate adequate
    reasoning in support of the overall conclusion.  I  am  satisfied  that
    she has not made any clear finding as to whether the Appellant  did  or
    did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  I am satisfied
    that the arguments advanced by Mr Lawrence are well made.

18. It is my view that this is a situation which requires a de novo hearing
    in the First-tier Tribunal.  I have reminded  myself  of  the  Practice
    Statement and in particular paragraph 7.2 which deals with remittal.  I
    am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal's determination should be set
    aside on account of an error of law, namely  inadequacy  of  reasoning,
    and that the matter should be heard afresh in the  First-tier  Tribunal
    by a different First-tier Judge.

No anonymity direction is made.
