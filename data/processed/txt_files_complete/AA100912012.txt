                            DECISION AND REASONS


This is an appeal against the determination dated 20 December 2012 of First-
tier Tribunal Judge Chohan which refused the appellant's  asylum  and  human
rights appeal.

The grounds of appeal dated  16  January  2013  state  that  the  First-tier
Tribunal  erred as follows:

      "1. In that the learned Judge failed properly or at  all  to  consider
      the risk top (sic) which A would  be  exposed  for  imputed  political
      opinion on return to Iran during  questioning  at  the  airport  as  a
      failed asylum seeker in the light of the Supreme Court's  decision  in
      RT (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2012]  3  WLR  345  and  in  the  light  of  the
      Strasbourg Court's findings at ï¿½54 of RC v Sweden [2010] ECHR 307 that
      any one who in any way opposes the current regime risks detention, ill-
      treatment or torture;


      2. The said ground of appeal raises a novel  and  important  point  of
      principle or practice in the light of the decision by  order  dated  9
      January 2013 of Sir Richard Buxton in an Iranian appeal in  the  Court
      of Appeal that  it  satisfies  the  second  tier  appeal  rule  (order
      attached)."


The grounds of appeal enclosed a skeleton argument dated  23  November  2012
and grant of permission to appeal dated 9 January 2013 from the Rt Hon.  Sir
Richard Buxton in the case referred to in paragraph 2. I will refer to  that
other case as "AA  (Iran)",  the  full  reference  on  the  documents  being
C5/2012/2711.

Mr Bedford informed me that AA (Iran) had been refused permission to  appeal
by the Court of Appeal on 28 March 2013. Mr Bedford  accepted  that  nothing
in the original grounds  of  appeal,  set  out  above,  could  amount  to  a
sustainable challenge to the decision of Judge Chohan. Undaunted, he  sought
to make a number of applications in order to vary  his  grounds  of  appeal.
The first suggestion variation  was  that,  in  the  light  of  the  country
material contained at pages 12,  24,  25,  27  and  28  of  the  appellant's
bundle, the First-tier Tribunal had erred  in  the  assessment  of  risk  on
return.

I declined to vary the grounds to  include  this  challenge.  There  was  no
reason why it could not have been made in the original grounds  but  it  was
not. There is no explanation for this. There was no explanation of why  this
application to vary the grounds was made only on the day of the hearing.  Mr
Bedford knew as of 28 March 2013 that the grounds upon which permission  had
been granted were rejected by the Court of Appeal in AA (Iran) and  that  he
would have to vary the grounds in this appeal if he was to have  any  chance
of success.  In addition, the country evidence  in  the  appellant's  bundle
relied on in Mr Bedford's argument covers only the well-known  and  accepted
evidence of the repressive nature of the Iranian regime and abuse  of  those
suspected of opposition. This appellant was not found to  have  anything  in
his background that might lead to his being of interest on return  and  that
assessment included his having left Iran illegally. There was  no  challenge
to the credibility findings of the First-tier Tribunal. It was my view  that
a challenge based only on this background evidence had to fail, even had  it
been brought timeously.

It appeared to me that Mr Bedford accepted that this first variation of  the
grounds had to fail as he was ready with a second submission to  the  effect
that Judge Chohan had erred in failing to consider the implications  of  the
Iran Operational Guidance Note dated October  2012,  in  particular  3.15.5.
This was a public document of which Judge Chohan could be expected  to  have
taken judicial notice even though it had not been in  the  materials  before
him and he had not been specifically referred to it.

There were obvious difficulties with this submission. The  original  grounds
of appeal upon which permission was granted did not argue that Judge  Chohan
erred in failing to consider the OGN. There was no reason  why  they  should
not have done so at any time prior to the hearing before me, and, as  above,
this was additionally the case after the failure of Mr  Bedford's  arguments
in AA (Iran) on 28 March 2013. Secondly, the OGN  also  does  not  take  the
assessment of risk of return  any  further  given  the  adverse  credibility
findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  It  contains  the  accepted  country
evidence on the repressive nature of the regime and  abuses  that  occur  in
Iran that were elsewhere in the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.  Mr
Bedford referred to paragraph 3.15.5 which covers the  likely  treatment  on
return of those who have exited illegally. It does not  state  that  illegal
exit will lead to significant mistreatment. Rather, prosecution for  illegal
exit includes an assessment of  the  circumstances  of  the  individual.  It
takes the question of mistreatment on return no further and cannot  show  an
error in the decision of Judge Chohan who found at [13] that this  appellant
would not face a risk on return merely because he had  exited  illegally.  I
declined to vary the grounds to include a challenge on the basis of the  OGN
for these reasons.

 I also rejected a third formulation for  a  variation  of  the  grounds  of
appeal which included an application  to  admit  new  evidence.  Mr  Bedford
applied to admit  a  Country  of  Origin  Information  Report  (COIR)  dated
January 2013, with particular reliance on paragraph 32.27. This states  that
an Amnesty International report dated  February  2012  provided  information
from a report by a Swiss refugee agency which had quoted an unnamed  Iranian
judge. This unnamed judge spoke of failed asylum seekers having carried  out
"propaganda against Iran" and trying to "destroy the reputation of Iran"  if
they  made  untrue  statements  as  part  of  their   asylum   claim   about
mistreatment by the state. In order to stop this, the individuals "will"  be
detained until the authorities establish that  they  were  not  involved  in
political activity. If they had brought the state into  disrepute,  a  judge
should pass a sentence. Mr Bedford argued that it  could  be  inferred  from
this paragraph, following the principle of RT (Zimbabwe)  v  SSHD  [2012]  3
WLR 345, that a failed asylum seeker who had left Iran illegally would  have
to lie about the fact of a failed asylum claim and show pro-regime views  in
order to avoid being imputed with an  anti-regime  political  opinion  which
would result in mistreatment.

It will be obvious that the COIR was not before Judge Chohan as it  had  not
been published at the time of the hearing before  him.  I  suggested  to  Mr
Bedford that it therefore could not show an error in  the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal. He maintained that it should be admitted  and  argument
allowed on it nevertheless on an exceptional basis as  it  was  "compelling"
evidence. He also referred to Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 and  suggested
that the principle of not expecting someone to return merely to  seek  entry
clearance was analogous to not expecting  someone  to  make  a  fresh  claim
merely on the basis of new country evidence that was available to me. I  did
not accept the analogy; the former arose from a  policy  applied  inflexibly
and therefore unlawfully by the state. The latter is a  legal  principle  at
the heart of the error of law jurisdiction. The two are simply not the  same
or analogous. Mr Bedford referred to  Ravichandran  [1996]  Imm  AR  97  and
submitted that I had to decide the appeal as of the date  of  hearing.  That
argument again ignores the principle of the error of law  jurisdiction  that
requires me to assess the decision of the First-tier Tribunal on  the  basis
of the evidence that was before it and is not subject  to  the  Ravichandran
principle.  I  could  not  see  anything  in  Mr  Bedford's  arguments  that
indicated that this material should not form part of a  fresh  asylum  claim
by the appellant rather than it having any  relevance  to  the  decision  of
Judge Chohan.

In addition, there was no attempt to  seek  permission  to  admit  this  new
evidence in line with Rule 15 of the Procedure Rules. The document had  been
available since January 2013. Mr Bedford had known of  the  failure  of  the
arguments in AA (Iran) since 23 March 2013 but had  not  attempted  to  seek
permission to admit a document essential to the variation of his grounds  of
appeal until the hearing before me. For these reasons, I declined  to  admit
the COIR and declined to vary the grounds in order to include argument  upon
it.

For what it is worth, it did not appear to me that  Mr  Bedford's  arguments
could have succeeded even if I had allowed  the  grounds  to  be  varied  to
include challenges based on the OGN and the COIR.  As  in  AA  (Iran),  this
appellant was found wholly incredible. He is  returning  only  as  a  failed
asylum seeker who  left  Iran  illegally.  Even  had  Mr  Bedford's  current
arguments been put to Judge Chohan (which they were not),  the  real  thrust
of Mr Bedford's case is founded on paragraph  32.27  of  the  COIR.   It  is
difficult to see how one reference from an unnamed judge in a report from  a
Swiss refugee agency and an article written  by  a  former  Iranian  Supreme
Court Judge to  imputed  negative  political  opinion  being  attributed  to
returned failed asylum seekers would be sufficient to show a risk on  return
by way of imputed political  opinion  for  all  failed  asylum  seekers  who
exited illegally. I did not have the transcript or decision  before  me  but
it appeared to me very likely that the Court of Appeal found the same in  AA
(Iran).

For all of these reasons I did not find that the determination of the First-
tier Tribunal disclosed an error on a point of law such that  it  should  be
set aside.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an error on a point of  law  such  that
the decision should be set aside.  The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
shall stand.
