Representation:
For the appellant:     in person
For the respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a national of India, appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    against a decision made by the respondent on 30 October 2014 to  refuse
    his application for leave to remain in the UK as  a  Tier  2  (General)
    Migrant.  Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Britton dismissed the appeal
    and the appellant now appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 2. The issue in this appeal is the allocation of the job description  code
    in the Certificate of Sponsorship (COS). The  background  is  that  the
    appellant entered the UK on 28 December 2011  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student Migrant until 15 October 2014. He made the present  application
    on 8 October 2014 for further leave to remain as  a  Tier  2  (General)
    Migrant based on his proposed employment with the  sponsor,  the  Books
    and Periodicals Agency. According to the application form the job title
    is 'Sales and IT Development'. The job title on the COS is 'Sales, IT &
    Business  Development'.   The  gross  annual  salary  stated   on   the
    application form and the COS is �24,000. The COS describes the job type
    as '2133' 'IT specialist managers'.  The  Reasons  for  Refusal  letter
    states  that  the  respondent  awarded  the  appellant  0  points   for
    appropriate salary as the COS states that  the  prospective  employment
    most closely corresponds to  occupation  code  2133  on  the  Codes  of
    Practice (specified under Appendix  Judge  of  the  Immigration  Rules)
    which stipulates that the acceptable rate of pay for that employment is
    �25,000 for a  new  entrant.  The  application  was  therefore  refused
    because the prospective salary is not at or above the minimum  rate  as
    specified in the cores of practice.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that, although the job title of the
    appellant's proposed employment does not mention  the  word  'manager',
    the job description does  state  that  the  appellant  must  have  'the
    ability manage staff' and that the appellant would therefore be working
    in a managerial role and the respondent had  therefore  been  right  to
    place the appellant's job in the occupational code for an  IT  manager.
    He found that the appellant's proposed salary  was  not  sufficient  to
    meet the requirements of that occupational code.

 4. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the Judge
    failed to understand that the Home Office case worker validated the COS
    and inserted the SOC code 2133. It is contended that  the  case  worker
    should have contacted the appellant and the sponsor to advise that  the
    COS was invalid. The appellant contends that the Judge misread the  job
    description which  states  that  the  ability  to  manage  staff  is  a
    desirable rather than an essential requirement. It  is  contended  that
    the letters before the Judge showed that the  sponsor  considered  that
    the occupational code should have been 3545 or 3131 both of which  have
    a starting salary of �24,000.  The appellant contends that he  did  not
    have a fair hearing. Permission to appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Holmes on the basis  that  it  is  arguable  that  Judge
    Britton did not  engage  with  the  appellant's  case  that  there  was
    procedural unfairness.

 5. At the hearing before me  Mr  Birdi  referred  to  a  letter  dated  22
    September 2014 from the sponsor to the Home Office in  response  to  an
    email dated 17 September 2014 in relation to  a  sponsor  licence.  The
    letter says that the vacant position is  that  of  'Sales,  information
    technology and business development' and set out the  job  description.
    He submitted that the sponsor did not insert a code in the  application
    as he did not want to make a mistake and that the code allocated by the
    Home Office relates to an IT specialist which does not correspond  with
    the job title and job  description  put  forward  by  the  sponsor.  He
    submitted that the case worker had already  contacted  the  sponsor  by
    email on 17 September and that they should have contacted the appellant
    or the sponsor again if the issue was not clear. He submitted that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge was wrong in  accepting  that  code  2133  is
    right as he accepted that the appellant's role is  that  of  a  manager
    without realising that this  is  one  of  the  desirable  criteria.  He
    submitted that the Judge did not go through all of the codes.

 6. Mr Bramble submitted that the Tribunal is the wrong forum for making an
    allegation that the respondent took the wrong approach to dealing  with
    the application, he submitted that the appellant should have made these
    allegations by way of Judicial Review. I asked Mr Bramble if there  was
    any policy or guidance covering this situation but he said that he  did
    not have a copy of the relevant guidance applicable at  that  time.  Mr
    Bramble submitted that the Judge did properly set out  the  appellant's
    case and that he engaged with the issues before him. He submitted  that
    the Judge engaged with the competing  factors  and  took  note  of  the
    appellant's case.  He  submitted  that  the  decision  maker  made  the
    decision based on the COS and that the appellant  had  not  established
    that the sponsor did not insert the code. He submitted that  the  Judge
    reached a perfectly reasoned decision.

 7. Mr Birdi responded by submitting  he  does  not  know  where  the  code
    inserted in the COS came from. He submitted that  if  the  sponsor  had
    wanted the appellant to be employed as an IT specialist under code 2133
    they would have paid him the required �25,000 salary.

    Error of Law

 8. The letters submitted by the appellant from the director of the sponsor
    company dated 20 January  2015  and  the  Company  secretary  dated  25
    January 2015 both state that the sponsor did not insert  the  SOC  code
    2133 which appears on the COS. In  his  letter  the  Company  Secretary
    outlines  the  correspondence  between  the  company  and  the  Sponsor
    Casework Operations Unit and says that he did  not  understand  how  an
    invalid COS (ie one where the salary This evidence was before the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge along with the  appellant's  own  evidence  in  the
    grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. There  was  therefore  an
    issue before the First-tier Tribunal Judge as to  procedural  fairness.
    The Judge identified this issue at paragraph 5 where he said  that  the
    appellant had contended in his grounds of appeal that  the  immigration
    officer had placed the employment under the wrong code.

 9. The Judge purports to deal with the issues in the appeal  at  paragraph
    12 where he concluded that the appellant's proposed employment did come
    within one of the job titles mentioned under the code 2133. In so doing
    he does not appear to have  taken  account  of  the  letters  from  the
    company secretary and director of the sponsor  company  which  indicate
    the contrary. The First-tier Tribunal Judge made no findings as to  the
    appellant's claim that the code was not inserted by the sponsor but  by
    the case worker. Accordingly I conclude that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge failed to engage fully with the issue of procedural fairness.  In
    these circumstances I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge and remake the decision.

    Remaking the decision

10. According to the documents before me the appellant was  issued  with  a
    new COS for Business Development manager (SOC 3545) on 20  April  2015.
    However I do not take account of that in remaking the decision.

11. I suggested to the parties, who had no objection, that if  I  found  an
    error of law in this decision it would be  appropriate  to  return  the
    decision to the Secretary of State in light of  the  procedural  issues
    raised.

12. The appellant and sponsor say that the COS was issued  by  the  Sponsor
    Casework  Operations  Unit.  Mr  Bramble  submitted  that  it  was  his
    understanding that the COS was assigned by  the  employer.  It  appears
    from the letter from Sponsor Casework Operations Unit  to  the  sponsor
    dated 24 September 2014 that the sponsor was to set  up  a  Sponsorship
    Management System (SMS) user account to assign a COS to  a  worker  and
    then the certificate is approved by the Home Office.

13. The invalid COS ends  with  the  'migrant  caseworker  user  id'  which
    suggests that a Home Office case worker completed or approved the  COS.
    It appears from the SOC codes before me that the  job  description  put
    forward by the sponsor in this  case  differs  significantly  from  the
    example job tasks  set  out  under  code  2133,  which  applied  to  IT
    specialist managers. It is difficult to  understand  why  the  Casework
    Operations Unit would issue an invalid COS with a conflicting code  and
    salary. The appellant and his sponsor assert that this is what happened
    and there is nothing from the  Home  Office  apart  from  Mr  Bramble's
    assertion to the contrary.  The conflict  between  the  code,  the  job
    description and the salary which led to the COS being declared  invalid
    is at odds with the appellant's evidence  and  with  the  tone  of  the
    correspondence with the Sponsor Casework Operations Unit prior  to  the
    decision. I  conclude  that  there  is  sufficient  evidence  from  the
    appellant and the sponsor to suggest that a caseworker inserted an  SOC
    code.

14. I conclude on the evidence before me that in  these  circumstances  the
    Sponsor Casework Operations Unit should have considered the  provisions
    paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules on the basis that the  sponsor
    had submitted a document (the COS) which did not  contain  all  of  the
    specified  information  (the  SOC  code)  and  should  have  considered
    contacting  the  appellant  or  the  sponsor  to  request  the  missing
    information.

15. In these circumstances I conclude that the decision of 30 October  2014
    is not in accordance with the law and that the application for leave to
    remain therefore remains outstanding before the Secretary of State  for
    consideration of the exercise of discretion under paragraph 245AA.

    Conclusion:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of a material error on a point of law.

    I remake the decision by allowing it to the extent that the application
    remains outstanding before the Secretary of  State  to  make  a  lawful
    decision.
