                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. These are the appellants' appeals against the decision of  Judge  Flynn
    made following a hearing at Taylor House on 4th November 2015.



Background

 2. The first appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 20th November 1989
    and the second appellant is a citizen of India born on  30th  September
    1984.  They have both been in the UK since 2008, separately, on student
    visas, and have been in a relationship since  2009.   They  started  to
    live together in  2010.   The  nature  of  their  relationship  is  not
    challenged.

 3. Their initial visas were extended on a number  of  different  occasions
    but they have not had leave as students since 2013 and it is not argued
    that they can meet the requirements of any of the Immigration Rules.

 4. The application which was the subject of the appeal before Judge Flynn,
    on the basis of private and family life, was refused on  3rd  September
    2014.  It was accepted both by the respondent and  by  the  Immigration
    Judge that return to Pakistan was not an option  open  to  the  couple.
    However it is the respondent's case, and  the  judge  agreed,  that  it
    would be reasonable for them to live in India.

 5. Although neither of the appellants had made a  claim  to  asylum,  they
    argued that they might be killed upon a return, because their  families
    both  opposed  the  relationship.  They  would  be  rejected  by   both
    communities as neither accepted people from another religion.   In  any
    event living in India was  not  a  practical  possibility.   The  first
    appellant could not go there without obtaining documents from Pakistan.



 6. The judge found neither of the appellants particularly  credible.   She
    said that they were inconsistent in relation to the amount of financial
    support which the second  appellant  received  and  inconsistent  about
    whether they would marry. The inconsistencies cast significant doubt on
    the reliability of their evidence, in particular their claim that their
    families had cut them off.   The second appellant confirmed  that  they
    wished to marry although the first was more ambivalent.

 7. She concluded however that it was more likely than  not  that  marriage
    would be an acceptable course of action for both.

 8. The judge said that the core of the appeal  was  whether  it  would  be
    reasonable to expect either appellant to accompany the other  to  their
    country of origin in order to maintain  the  relationship,  or  whether
    doing so would threaten their physical or moral integrity.

 9. She observed that the second appellant had  not  mentioned  any  family
    member or other person having  made  any  threat  against  him  or  his
    partner and she attached limited weight to the letter from  his  sister
    which said that he had brought shame and disgrace on the family.

10. She considered the background evidence carefully, including the  report
    by Mr Jatinder Sharma, but she accorded little  weight  to  it  because
    there was no evidence that  he  had  significant  expertise  in  Indian
    immigration law.  His opinions were not supported by any citations  and
    heavily focussed  on  the  position  of  unmarried  couples  and  their
    children.  Moreover  his  conclusions  were  not  consistent  with  the
    country information and guidance report of April 2015 quoting from  the
    Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  of  Canada's  Report  on   interfaith
    marriages in May 2012.

11. She concluded that it would be reasonable for the  couple  to  live  in
    India so long as they did not try to settle in a rural area.   On  that
    basis she dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

12. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the following grounds.

13. First, it was argued that the Immigration Judge had failed to  consider
    the feasibility of the couple's relocation to  India  as  an  unmarried
    couple alongside perverse findings and omissions concerning the  expert
    and objective evidence.  The crux of the appellants' case was that they
    could not marry unless one  converts  to  the  other's  religion.   The
    finding that the couple could relocate to India without breaching their
    Article 8 rights of physical and moral integrity ignores the fact  that
    they are  an  unmarried  couple  who  could  not  marry  due  to  their
    respective faiths.

14. The judge had ignored the fact that the first appellant  cannot  obtain
    entry clearance to India without being married to the second  appellant
    and cannot even obtain entry clearance as a visitor without  having  an
    NADRA card which she does not have.  She had not taken account  of  the
    large volume of evidence  provided  from  the  Indian  High  Commission
    regarding the feasibility of the first appellant's entry into India.

15. The judge had erred by placing little weight upon the report  from  the
    Indian advocate.  The expert  had  acted  as  such  in  seven  previous
    appeals in various jurisdictions concerning Indian immigration  and  it
    was perverse to disregard his analysis of Indian immigration  law.   It
    is unclear what citations could have been given.  The information  from
    the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada's  Report  was  over  three
    years out of date whereas the objective evidence  referred  to  by  the
    appellants was recent and more relevant.  It showed  a  departure  from
    the position that violence against interfaith couples  takes  place  in
    rural areas alone.

16. Second, the judge had conducted a flawed assessment of the  appellant's
    exceptional circumstances  and  insurmountable  obstacles  outwith  the
    Rules.  Even if the judge was correct that the level of violence  would
    not violate their physical and moral integrity, this is a matter  which
    falls outwith the Immigration Rules and might make their relocation  to
    India disproportionate.  She failed to appreciate that the  Immigration
    Rules require a preformatted application of insurmountable obstacles as
    a minimum mandatory criteria to success, but they artificially  elevate
    the  status  of  insurmountable  obstacles  not  reflecting  Strasbourg
    prudence.  The judge did not make it clear  whether  her  analysis  was
    being performed under or outwith the Rules.  If outwith the Rules,  she
    elevated the insurmountable obstacles  test  to  an  artificially  high
    criterion.

17. Finally, the judge failed to consider  the  importance  of  the  second
    appellant's section 3C/3D leave upon his status at present and  whether
    the respondent's failure  to  act  upon  the  successful  determination
    before the First-tier Tribunal should have  had  any  effect  upon  the
    assessment of the public interest in removing a wronged person.

18. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Landes, on 3rd  August  2016,
    who said that all grounds were arguable.

19. The respondent served a  reply  on  15th  August  2016  addressing  the
    section 3C leave point.  Following a successful appeal in  March  2011,
    when the second appellant's appeal was allowed to the extent  that  the
    Secretary of State exercise a residual discretion, she  maintained  her
    refusal on 22nd August 2011.  There  was  then  an  appeal  hearing  in
    October 2011 when the appeal was dismissed.   The  appellant  therefore
    has no 3C leave on the basis of an allowed appeal in March 2011.

20. Otherwise the respondent defended the determination.

Submissions

21. Mr Saini had not seen the Rule 24 reply, but, when he was  given  sight
    of the determination of October 2011, he acknowledged that he could not
    pursue his final ground.  However having taken  instructions,  he  said
    that the second appellant was not aware of the  October  decision,  and
    the point was not falsely taken.

22. He submitted that it was not palatable for  the  Immigration  Judge  to
    suggest that the couple should marry.  If they were to do  so,  one  or
    the other would have to compromise their  religious  beliefs  and  they
    were not willing to do so.

23. The fact of the matter was that the couple would be  separated  for  an
    indefinite period.  According to the objective evidence  there  was  no
    provision for them to enter India as unmarried partners.  The judge had
    not properly engaged with the expert report or with the  material  from
    the Indian  authorities  which  established  that  there  was  no  visa
    available to the first appellant. The couple could not marry in the  UK
    because neither had valid leave here.

24. Moreover Pakistan and India were now virtually at war, and India  would
    be even more hesitant to grant visas to Pakistani nationals.  The first
    appellant did not have the  relevant  documentation  and  it  would  be
    necessary for her to reside in Pakistan for a while in order to  obtain
    it.  There was no support network available for her there.   The  judge
    had simply failed to engage with that evidence.

25. Finally, he submitted that the judge's approach to Article 8 was flawed
    because she had conducted a hollow exercise in  considering  Article  8
    outside the Rules  at  the  tail  end  of  the  determination  and  had
    conflated the insurmountable obstacle test within  the  Rules  with  an
    assessment of proportionality outside them.

26. Mr Wilding defended the determination.  He submitted that the judge was
    correct to place little weight on the unsourced opinion of a so  called
    expert who had not even attached his CV to the report.  His opinion was
    predicated upon the first appellant not wanting to apply  for  a  visit
    visa because she said that she  could  not  go  to  Pakistan.   He  had
    therefore asked himself the wrong question.  She had no right to be  in
    the UK and in fact would be applying from Pakistan  for  a  visit  visa
    which the expert himself said would be a route to marriage in India.

27. In relation to the second point, the decision had to be looked at as  a
    whole and not confined to the final paragraphs.  The  judge  was  fully
    aware that the application was being made squarely  outside  the  Rules
    and had applied the correct test.

28. By way of reply Mr Saini defended the expert's report which he said was
    not opinion based but factual and not rebutted by any evidence from the
    Secretary of State.  He repeated that the couple could not be forced to
    marry and the fact was that they could  not  marry  here  or  in  India
    because of their religious beliefs.  In effect they would be living  on
    a perpetuating cycle of visit visas.

Findings and Conclusions

29. There is no error of law  in  this  determination,  for  the  following
    reasons.

30. First, these appellants, although their relationship has been accepted,
    were not found to be credible by the Immigration  Judge.   She  clearly
    had doubts about the evidence in  relation  to  the  financial  support
    which the second appellant received. He said that his  father  had  not
    continued  supporting  him  after  he  told  his  parents   about   the
    relationship and he had been supported by some of his friends.  On  the
    other hand, his partner said that he got money from his friends and may
    be his family and she thought he might have been receiving  money  from
    his sister a couple of times a year although it was not regular.

31. The judge gave sustainable reasons for treating the evidence  that  the
    couple would be ostracised by the second appellant's family with  great
    caution. She was entitled to conclude that the failure to give credible
    evidence about how the  couple  had  been  supported  financially  cast
    significant doubt on their claim that their families had cut them  off.
    She outlined the inconsistencies in the evidence. She took into account
    the letter from the sister stating that they  would  be  in  danger  on
    return to India but said why it should be given limited weight.

32. According to the second appellant, the couple had thought about a civil
    marriage in the UK, but they did  not  have  the  documents,  which  is
    inconsistent with the present submission that the couple are  unwilling
    to marry.  Moreover, the  appellants'  position,  that  they  are  both
    deeply committed to their religion such that they would not be prepared
    to marry each other, sits ill with their present situation i.e.  living
    as an unmarried couple in defiance of  the  tenets  of  both  of  their
    religions.

33. It is against this backdrop that it was open to the judge  to  find  it
    more likely than not that marriage would be  an  acceptable  course  of
    action for them both.

34. The judge was not bound to accept the submission that the couple  would
    be separated for  an  indefinite  period.   If  they  chose  to  remain
    unmarried then of course the only option available to them would  be  a
    series of visit visas.  That is their  choice.   On  the  evidence  the
    judge was  perfectly  entitled  to  conclude  that  marriage  would  be
    acceptable to both, and that there would be  no  real  difficulties  in
    them settling in India without the  assistance  of  family.   It  would
    appear from the expert that the couple have a  viable  way  of  seeking
    entry to India by virtue of the second appellant sponsoring his partner
    to join her from Pakistan.

35. It may well be the case, as the expert says, that it is not possible to
    obtain a visa as an unmarried partner in India.  However the fact  that
    the expert had listed the different type  of  visas  that  a  Pakistani
    national can apply for, and it did not include a fianc� visa, does  not
    mean that the judge was bound to find that it is not possible to  apply
    for one. Moreover, the judge gave proper reasons for  attaching  little
    weight to the expert's  opinion  on  the  grounds  that  there  was  no
    evidence that he had any significant expertise  in  Indian  immigration
    law.  Given that the expert did not even attach a CV to his report that
    was a conclusion plainly open to her.

36. Mr Saini also submitted that the judge had not considered the  evidence
    of contact between the second appellant and the  consular  services  in
    India, which established that no fianc� visa was available.   I  accept
    that the judge did not address the email trail but it  would  not  have
    made any difference if she had.  There is no mention of an enquiry  for
    a fianc� visa.  Indeed the premise of the questions is that the  couple
    wanted to apply for a visa as an unmarried couple.

37. The expert opinion was that the couple could not reasonably and  safely
    live together in India as an unmarried couple because it was considered
    taboo in Indian  society.   He  also  said  that  there  was  a  strong
    objection to intercaste marriage and interreligious marriage  and  that
    there was a high threat to the life and liberty of the couple in India.

38. The judge was entitled to prefer the CIG Report of April 2015,  quoting
    an earlier report in relation to the position  of  interfaith  couples,
    who would  generally  be  safe.  Only  in  certain  rural  areas  would
    individuals outside the family take any interest in them.

39. Mr Saini submitted that the judge had not taken into account  the  fact
    that there would be a delay in the couple being united in India because
    the first appellant would have to return  to  Pakistan  to  obtain  the
    necessary documentation. It is correct that  the  judge  did  not  make
    specific reference to any such delay, but it is immaterial.  The  first
    appellant has not raised any serious objection to going to Pakistan  in
    that she has not applied for asylum in the UK.  She is a  27  year  old
    well-educated woman who travelled to the UK to study when  she  was  19
    years old, and has therefore  shown  herself  to  be  self-reliant  and
    resourceful.  Even if  the  judge  had  considered  the  issue  of  her
    returning to Pakistan for a brief period of time in order to apply  for
    a visit visa, it would have made no difference to her decision.

40. The recent deterioration in the relationship between India and Pakistan
    can have no bearing on the judge's decision.

41. With regard to the second ground, it is true that the  judge  did  make
    reference  to  insurmountable  obstacles  when  considering  Article  8
    outside the Rules.  However, it is quite clear from her reasoning  that
    she properly addressed herself to the question  of  reasonableness  and
    indeed, at the commencement of her conclusions  set  out  the  position
    accurately at paragraph 64 when she wrote

         "The core of the appeal is whether it would be reasonable to expect
         either appellant to accompany the other to their country of  origin
         in order to maintain the relationship; or whether  doing  so  would
         have threatened their physical or moral integrity."

42. The appeal was always put on the basis that the  appellants  could  not
    meet the requirements of the Rules. It was plain that they not meet the
    requirements. The judge referred to them when she said  that  they  had
    not demonstrated that they met the requirements  of  Appendix  FM,  but
    that is wholly consistent with the guidance of the Court of  Appeal  in
    SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 which held that appropriate weight  must
    be given to the focussed consideration of public  interest  factors  as
    found expression in the formulation of the new Rules.   The  judge  was
    bound to take as her starting point the fact  that  the  couple  cannot
    meet the requirements of the Rules and in that context,  the  reference
    to insurmountable obstacles when  considering  Article  8  outside  the
    Rules is immaterial.

43. It is plain that the  basis  of  her  decision  was  that  it  was  not
    unreasonable for the couple to settle in another  part  of  India  away
    from the second appellant's  family  if  necessary,  and  she  was  not
    satisfied that it would not be possible  for  the  first  appellant  to
    obtain an appropriate visa to enable her to live in India.

44. The grounds disclose no  error  of  law.   The  appellants'  appeal  is
    dismissed and the judge's decision stands.

Notice of Decision
