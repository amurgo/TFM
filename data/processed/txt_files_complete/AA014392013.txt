                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms L Fenney, Duncan Moghal, Solicitors & Advocates
For the Respondent:    Mr K Hibbs, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
      2008 (SI 2008/269) I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
      Tribunal or Court directs otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings
      shall directly or indirectly identify the Appellant.   This  direction
      applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and a  failure  to
      comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to   Contempt   of   Court
      proceedings.


   2. The appellant s a citizen of Pakistan who was born in 1977.   She last
      entered the United Kingdom on 7 October 2012 with entry clearance as a
      Tier 4 Student.  Her three children also entered  as  her  dependents.
      The appellant's leave is valid until 28 February 2014.  On 31 December
      2012, she applied for asylum.   Her  application  was  refused  on  30
      January 2013.  On 1 February 2013, the Secretary of State refused  the
      appellant's claim for asylum.

   3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  s.83  of  the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  In a determination sent
      on 28 March 2013, Judge Trevaskis dismissed the appellant's appeal  on
      asylum grounds and under Art 8 of  the  ECHR.   Having  unsuccessfully
      sought permission to appeal from the First-tier Tribunal,  on  21  May
      2013 UTJ Kebebe granted the appellant  permission  to  appeal  to  the
      Upper Tribunal.

   4. The appeal came before me on 7 October 2013 when I heard oral argument
      from the parties on whether the Judge had erred in law  in  dismissing
      the appellant's claim on asylum grounds.  At  the  conclusion  of  the
      hearing, I reserved my decision.

   5. In preparing my determination, I reached  the  provisional  view  that
      there was, in fact, no valid appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      under s.83 of the 2002 Act.  Consequently, I wrote to the parties in a
      letter dated 9 October 2013 in the following terms:

           "On further  considering  the  submissions  made  at  the  Upper
           Tribunal hearing on 7 October 2013 and the documents on file,  I
           have reached the provisional view that there was no valid appeal
           before the First-tier Tribunal under s.83  of  the  Nationality,
           Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Subject to any further written
           submissions made by the parties within 14 days of this notice, I
           propose to issue a determination:

           (1) finding that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in failing
           to conclude that there was no valid appeal before it;

           (2) setting aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal; and

           (3) substituting a decision  that  there  was  no  valid  appeal
           before the First-tier Tribunal."

   6. I set out my reasons as follows:

           At the date of the Secretary of  State's  decision  [1  February
           2013], the appellant had leave valid  until  28  February  2014.
           Although that was leave in excess of one year, the appellant did
           not have a right of appeal under s.83 of the 2002 Act.   Section
           83 states that:

               "(1)    This section applies where  a  person  has  made  an
                    asylum claim and -

                 a) his claim has been rejected by the Secretary  of  State,
                    but

                 b) he has been granted leave to  enter  or  remain  in  the
                    United Kingdom for a period exceeding one year  (or  for
                    periods exceeding one year in aggregate).

                 2) The person  may  appeal  to  the  Tribunal  against  the
                    rejection of his asylum claim."

           In Win (s.83 - Order of Events) [2012]  UKUT  00365  (IAC),  the
           Upper Tribunal concluded that an appeal under s.83 could only be
           brought if the relevant grant of leave (namely that referred  to
           in s.83(1)(b)) post-dated the asylum claim.  In this case,  that
           does not apply as the appellant's grant of leave  pre-dated  her
           claim made on 31 December 2012. Consequently the appellant  does
           not have a right of appeal under s.83 of the 2002 Act.

           Although the Secretary of State's decision letter of 1  February
           2013 purports to recognise a right of  appeal  under  s.83  that
           statement cannot create a right of appeal to the Tribunal if  no
           such right of appeal is conferred by the 2002 Act.

           For the avoidance of doubt, the appellant has no right of appeal
           under s.82(2)(d) because the result of the refusal to  vary  her
           leave was not such that she had "no leave to enter or remain".

   7. On 16 October 2013, the  appellant's  representatives,  Duncan  Moghal
      sent brief submissions to the Upper Tribunal.  No representations have
      been received from the respondent.  In their  representations,  Duncan
      Moghal accept that the appellant did not have a right of appeal  under
      s.83 and invite me to set aside  Judge  Trevaskis'  determination  for
      want of jurisdiction.

Decision

   8. Having considered  the  representations,  I  have  concluded  that  my
      provisional view is correct.

   9. For the reasons I have given, there was not a valid appeal before  the
      First-tier Tribunal.  That determination, along with any findings  set
      out therein, is set aside.

  10. I substitute a decision that there was  no  valid  appeal  before  the
      First-tier Tribunal.
