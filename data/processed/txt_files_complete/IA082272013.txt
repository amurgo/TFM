                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                                ISMAIL GUTALE
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. T Wilding, HOPO
For the Respondent:     Ms G Mellon, Counsel


                                  DECISION

1.   Mr Wilding made an application for permission under  Rules  17  of  the
    Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules to withdraw  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision so that  the  respondent's  case  can  be  reconsidered.   The
    application which had  been  made  in  writing  on  9  March  2015  was
    principally based of the country guidance case of MOJ & Ors (Return  to
    Mogadishu) (Rev 1) CG [2014] UKUT 442.  This was opposed by  Ms  Mellon
    who relied on the  Upper  Tribunal's  decision  in  SM  (withdrawal  of
    appealed decision: effect) Pakistan [2014] UKUT 00064.

2.   After hearing submissions by the  parties,  I  decided  to  accept  the
    Secretary of State's application to withdraw her decision in this case.

3.    Consequently,  the  appeal  under  section  82  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 is no longer pending.
