Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Hosein of SEB Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Beach promulgated on 30 June 2017  dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against a decision of the Respondent dated 20 April 2015 to  refuse  to
    vary leave to remain  and  to  issue  removal  directions  pursuant  to
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

2.   The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on  16  November  1983.
    He entered the United Kingdom on 16 December 2009 with leave  until  21
    November 2012.  On 25 September 2012 he was granted  further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant until 25 September 2014.  On 23
    September 2014 he made an application for further leave to remain as  a
    Tier 2 (General) Migrant.

3.    The  Appellant's  application  was  supported  by  a  Certificate   of
    Sponsorship  purportedly  in  respect  of  employment  as  a   Business
    Development Manager for Baygold Resources  Ltd  (trading  as  Chilttern
    Hotel - sic. i.e. 'Chilttern'  with  two  't's).   The  Certificate  of
    Sponsorship is a false document.  The Appellant now  acknowledges  that
    to be the case, but protests that he was wholly unaware  of  this  fact
    when it was submitted in support of his application.

4.   The Respondent refused the Appellant's application on 23 June 2015  for
    reasons set out in  a  combined  Notice  of  Immigration  Decision  and
    'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL'), essentially on  the  basis  that
    the  Certificate  of  Sponsorship  was  false  -   the   decision-maker
    consequently invoked paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules.

5.   It is convenient to note at this juncture  that  paragraph  322(1A)  is
    one of the grounds of mandatory refusal in respect of  an  application.
    It is in the following terms, so far as is relevant to this  particular
    case.


         "Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter
         or remain in the United Kingdom are to be refused;

         ...
         (1A) where ... false documents ... have been submitted (whether or
             not material to the application, and whether or not to the
             applicant's knowledge), ..."
6.    Paragraph  322(1A)  is  a  distinct  and  different   provision   from
    paragraphs 320(7A) and (7B) which deal with the circumstances in  which
    a person who  has  previously  employed  deception  in  support  of  an
    application may expect to be refused.  Paragraph 320(7B)  was  referred
    to in the RFRL - but not as a basis of refusal, but as  a  notification
    in respect of "any future applications for entry clearance or leave  to
    enter".   I  mention  this  because  it  does  indeed  seem  that   the
    Appellant's primary concern in pursuing his appeal -  both  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and now before the  Upper  Tribunal  -  is  not  in
    respect of establishing that he  was  entitled  to  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules so much as in anticipation of a  prospective  refusal
    on some future application.  In this regard - bearing in mind that  the
    Appellant acknowledges that he did not  have  a  valid  Certificate  of
    Sponsorship, and that he could not have succeeded  on  his  application
    under the Rules - it is accepted that he could not  have  succeeded  on
    his appeal under the  Rules  irrespective  of  the  issue  of  personal
    culpability for the submission of the false document.

7.   Indeed Mr Hosein on behalf of  the  Appellant  acknowledged  before  me
    today that even if I were to find an error of law on the  part  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, the Appellant could  not  succeed  on  his  appeal
    before me if I were to proceed to re-make the decision, and  could  not
    proceed in front of a different Immigration Judge if the matter were to
    be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  Indeed he acknowledged as much
    before the First-tier Tribunal: "... Mr Hosein said the best  that  the
    appellant could achieve was a finding that Paragraph  322(1A)  was  not
    engaged allowing the appellant to make a new application" (paragraph 17
    of Judge Beach's decision).

8.   It seems to me that this is not a good use of the facility extended  by
    way of the Tribunal to unsuccessful applicants to  challenge  decisions
    made by the  Secretary  of  State.  There  is  nothing  to  prevent  an
    unsuccessful applicant aggrieved by the invocation of paragraph 322(1A)
    raising challenge in the context of a subsequent application that might
    consequently be vulnerable to invocation of 322(7A)  or  (7B),  and  if
    refused raising such arguments on  appeal.  Given  that  the  Appellant
    acknowledged he could not achieve an overall successful outcome in this
    appeal, had I found there to be an error of law  on  the  part  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal this may well have  influenced  very  significantly
    any  exercise  of  discretion  pursuant  to  section  12(2)(a)  of  the
    Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 as to  whether  or  not  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside.

9.   Be that as it may, the  Appellant  appealed  to  the  IAC  against  the
    Respondent's decision of 20 April 2015, as was his right.   His  appeal
    was dismissed for reasons set out in the Decision of Judge Beach.   The
    Appellant applied for permission to appeal which was granted by  First-
    tier Tribunal Hollingworth on 24 January 2018.

10.  The matter that  was  explored  in  particular  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, and forms much of the basis of the submissions before me,  is
    the somewhat unusual claimed circumstances of the  acquisition  of  the
    Certificate of Sponsorship.

11.   As  I  have  indicated  the  Appellant  now  acknowledges   that   the
    Certificate of Sponsorship was false.  In this regard  in  his  witness
    statement dated 7 December 2016 he refers  to  having  contacted  a  Mr
    Ahmed Bakhtiar Mahadi of London  Law  Associate  (an  OISC  firm)  "for
    suitable job after successfully completing my degree", and states  that
    Mr Mahadi had assured him that he would be able to manage to obtain him
    a suitable job.  He also says that there was an agreement that he would
    pay Mr Mahadi �12,000 for the cost of his service.  It is to  be  noted
    that this  represents  almost  half  of  the  annual  income  that  the
    Appellant had claimed that he would be receiving in consequence of  the
    job that had been secured for him - (albeit it  turns  out  that  there
    appears to have been no such job).

12.  One cannot help but thinking  that  there  is  something  awry  when  a
    graduate approaches an immigration adviser  in  respect  of  finding  a
    suitable job rather than approaching, say for example, a job agency, or
    making applications directly to  a  number  of  prospective  employers.
    Something more of this is hinted at in  the  matters  recorded  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal's Decision with regard to the Appellant's  evidence
    - although to some extent this is  obscured  by  the  fact  that  there
    appears to  have  been  some  concern  as  to  the  competency  of  the
    Appellant's  English  to  the  extent  that  resort  was  had   to   an
    interpreter.  The Judge records "The appellant said that he was  a  new
    graduate and was finding it hard to find  work  so  he  sought  advice"
    (paragraph 9).  This would suggest that  the  immigration  adviser  was
    contacted because the Appellant could not himself find employment.   To
    then be asked for a sum of �12,000 to find a job would, one would  have
    thought, started alarm bells ringing in  all  but  the  most  na�ve  of
    individuals with regard to whether or not there was a real and  genuine
    job to be offered, or whether or not in fact  something  more  sinister
    was at foot with regard to the production of documentation  to  support
    an application in respect of which there might otherwise have  been  no
    basis for making.

13.  I also pause to note in this regard that there  must  be  something  at
    least a little concerning in that the Appellant was seemingly unable to
    make himself clearly understood in English by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge notwithstanding that he has supposedly obtained a Masters  degree
    from a university whilst in the United Kingdom.

14.  Be that as it may, it is only fair to note that the representative  for
    the Respondent before the First-tier Tribunal acknowledged  that  there
    was evidence in support of the  Appellant's  explanation  that  he  was
    unaware that the Certificate of Sponsorship  was  false.  Moreover  the
    Judge in turn observed  "It  seems  to  me  that  there  is  sufficient
    evidence before me to show that the appellant  was  not  aware  of  the
    deception" (paragraph 22).  The evidence in  this  regard  -  over  and
    above the Appellant's personal testimony - was by  way  of  a  document
    headed 'Exclusive Negotiation Agreement'.

15.  The Appellant produced a document which on its face appeared  to  be  a
    Consent Order in proceedings in the County  Court  at  Clerkenwell  and
    Shoreditch, Claim No. [...........]  The Consent Order, which is  dated
    21 March 2017, is said to have been before Deputy District Judge  Gount
    sitting at the County Court on that date, and  approves  a  'settlement
    agreement' between the parties - the parties being the Appellant and Mr
    Ahmed Bakhtiar Mahadi.  The 'settlement agreement' - which in  fact  in
    the  version  that  is  before  me  is  headed  'Exclusive  Negotiation
    Agreement' - refers to the history of the Appellant's contact  with  Mr
    Mahadi, and Mr Mahadi obtaining for him the Certificate of Sponsorship.
     In this regard the narrative - as indeed  it  is  in  the  Appellant's
    witness statement - is to the effect that some sort  of  job  interview
    was arranged for the Appellant at a restaurant, and the  Appellant  was
    offered a job accordingly. The Certificate of Sponsorship was  supposed
    to be in relation to that job.  Reference is made to  the  exchange  of
    monies. This narrative account appears to be accepted by Mr Mahadi, who
    agrees to pay back monies to the Appellant.  The Consent  Order  itself
    is to the effect that the proceedings in the County  Court  are  to  be
    stayed upon the terms of the  settlement  agreement,  and  that  either
    party may apply  to  the  court  to  enforce  the  terms  of  the  said
    agreement, or to claim for breach of it, without the need  to  commence
    new proceedings.

16.  As I say, this seems to have been  sufficiently  persuasive  to  inform
    the approach adopted by the Respondent's representative,  and  in  turn
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge, as indicative that the Appellant had  no
    particular knowledge of the falsity of the Certificate of  Sponsorship.



17.  It is not for me to re-open those findings  of  facts  in  the  current
    proceedings. However, I observe that if the  circumstances  surrounding
    the Certificate of Sponsorship were to require to be  considered  again
    at some future point, then - bearing in mind that  false  documentation
    has already been utilised in support  of  the  Appellant's  application
    (i.e the Certificate of Sponsorship) - it  may  be  that  some  further
    scrutiny of the County Court documents would  be  appropriate.   I  say
    this at least in part mindful of the fact that Mr Mahadi in signing the
    'negotiation agreement'  in  effect  admitted  to  behaviour  which  is
    criminal; one wonders if it is liley that a defendant would be prepared
    to settle a civil action by admitting unlawful behaviour, the admission
    of which would also expose him to the risk of  loss  of  livelihood  if
    referred  to  the  OISC?  It  seems  to  me  that  some  more   careful
    consideration of these documents - perhaps  with  the  benefit  of  the
    opportunity  of  cross-referral  to  the  County  Court  -   might   be
    appropriate in due course.

18.   Nonetheless,  for  present  purposes  it   is   to   be   noted   that
    notwithstanding the Judge's conclusion that the Appellant  was  on  the
    face  of  it  not  directly  responsible  for  the  production  of  the
    Certificate of Sponsorship, and was unaware of it  being  submitted  on
    his behalf in support of his  application,  the  Judge  concluded  that
    paragraph 322(1A) was still engaged because the Certificate was a false
    document.

19.  In this regard the Judge had particular reference to  the  decision  in
    AA (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA Civ 773, and set  out  the  key  passages.  In
    particular I note the following: "It is plain that a false document  is
    one that tells a lie about itself".  On that basis the Judge found that
    paragraph 322(1A) was engaged irrespective of the Appellant's knowledge
    of the deception. Indeed the wording of the Rule makes  it  clear  that
    the knowledge of the applicant is not a prerequisite to the  engagement
    of paragraph 322(1A).  Of course knowledge would be a  prerequisite  in
    the context of paragraph 320(7B), but this is not a case that has  been
    decided on that basis. As I have observed above, it seems  to  me  that
    the focus of the Appellant's concerns are not on the instant  case  but
    on any prospective application that might be subject  to  refusal  with
    reference to paragraph 320(7B).   It  seems  that  what  the  Appellant
    should properly have done is marshalled his arguments and evidence  and
    presented them in support of any such future  application  -  to  argue
    that notwithstanding the use of a false document  he  himself  was  not
    guilty of deception. Such an  argument  could  not  avail  him  in  the
    instant proceedings.

20.   In  my  judgement  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in  applying  and
    following the case of AA (Nigeria) made no error of law. Indeed  it  is
    to be noted that in the grounds of challenge it is not  suggested  that
    the Judge misapplied the case of AA (Nigeria), or that the case  of  AA
    (Nigeria) was not binding on the Judge.  Rather it is  argued  that  AA
    (Nigeria) is wrongly decided.  I note that that does not form  a  sound
    basis for overturning the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. Far less
    do I find anything in the grounds  to  suggest  that  AA  (Nigeria)  is
    wrongly decided: Mr Hosein did  not  articulate  or  amplify  any  such
    submission before me.   He  did,  however,  seek  to  suggest  that  AA
    (Nigeria) might be distinguishable on the facts because the facts in AA
    (Nigeria) were different from the facts herein.  Inevitably  the  facts
    are likely to be different to some extent from  one  case  to  another;
    however, I can  see  nothing  in  such  differences  that  renders  the
    principles referred to and explored by the Judge at paragraph 25 of her
    Decision in any way inapplicable to the facts and circumstances of  the
    Appellant's case.

21.  I note that in granting permission to appeal First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Hollingworth appears to have explored matters not  directly  raised  in
    the grounds of appeal.   He  has  raised  a  question  with  regard  to
    'agency' and whether or not AA (Nigeria) perhaps is not  applicable  to
    the instant case because of the curtailment of agency  as  between  the
    Appellant and Mr Mahadi in that Mr Mahadi impliedly acted  without  due
    authority of the Appellant in submitting a false document.  It seems to
    me that the wording of paragraph 322(1A) is a complete obstacle to  any
    such argument: the Rule applies in circumstances where falsity has been
    employed without the knowledge of the applicant - and therefore  in  my
    judgement including circumstances  where  there  has  been  no  express
    agency so to do.

22.  Finally, with regard to Article 8 it is to be  noted  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge found against the Appellant at  paragraph  29.   In
    this regard there is a limited challenge in the grounds  of  appeal  in
    respect of Article 8, but Mr Hosein has not sought to expand upon  that
    before me.  In my judgement  there  is  nothing  of  substance  in  the
    Article 8 case as advanced either before the First-tier Tribunal or  in
    the grounds of challenge.  The entire focus has been on the  evidential
    materials and the arguments have been in respect  of  the  'dishonesty'
    issue with an eye on future applications. There has been no real  focus
    in evidence or submissions on establishing anything disproportionate in
    the decision of the Secretary of State.  Nothing of substance has  been
    filed with regard to the private life of the Appellant  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

23.  In all the circumstances I find that there is no material error of  law
    in the Decision of the First-tier Tribunal and it stands.

24.  As regards any perspective application, it is of  course  open  to  the
    Appellant to make any such application at any  time  as  he  sees  fit.
    Insofar as he is concerned that the issue of the past submission  of  a
    false document may be raised against him he can  file  those  materials
    that he has relied upon in these proceedings and  seek  to  argue  that
    they exonerate him - and in that regard he may find a degree of support
    from the observations of the representative for the Secretary of  State
    before the First-tier Tribunal, and indeed the finding  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal  Judge.   The  Respondent's  decision-maker  on  any  new
    application will no doubt wish to give due and proper consideration  to
    all of the circumstances at that time: it will  be  a  matter  for  the
    decision-maker as to what extent, if at all, any  further  enquiry  and
    investigation should be undertaken with regard to the circumstances  in
    which the County Court materials have come into being.

Notice of Decision

25.  There is no material error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and it stands.

26.  The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.

27.  No anonymity direction is sought or made.

The above represents a corrected transcript of ex tempore reasons  given  at
the conclusion of the hearing.
