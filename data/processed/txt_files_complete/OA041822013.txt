Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms C Johnrose, instructed by South Manchester Law
Centre
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Eya Loko Kuli, date of birth 14.11.96, is a  citizen  of
    Ethiopia.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Manuel, who dismissed her appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse entry clearance to the United Kingdom  for  family
    reunion pursuant to paragraph 352D of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge
    heard the appeal on 29.1.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    2.5.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.6.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Manuel should be set aside.

 6. In essence, the grounds of application for permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal contend that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to
    give weight to material evidence. In particular it is asserted that the
    judge did not engage with evidence of the appellant's parents, sibling,
    appellant and grandmother, as well as the evidence of  the  appellant's
    brother. There is also  a  challenge  under  article  8  assessment  of
    proportionality of the interference with family  life.  It  is  claimed
    that the judge failed to consider  that  the  appellant's  parents  and
    siblings have been refugees in a refugee camp in Kenya since they  fled
    Ethiopia and were only recently resettled in the UK. To that extent  it
    is said that the judge did not properly consider the unavailability  of
    being reunited with  the  appellant  before  then,  as  well  as  other
    material factors weighing in favour of the  appellant,  such  that  the
    proportionality assessment was flawed.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Macdonald noted that the  judge
    found in favour of the appellant in  relation  to  paragraph  352D(iii)
    "and it is arguable, for reasons given on the grounds, that  the  judge
    did not give adequate reasons for dismissing the appeal under paragraph
    352D(iv). Permission is granted on both grounds."

 8. For the reasons set out herein, I find no material error of law in  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal  such  that  it  requires  the
    decision to be set aside and remade.

 9. There is no challenge that the appellant is the child of  the  sponsor,
    nor that she is under the age of 18. It is also accepted that  Mr  Kuli
    has been granted refugee status in the UK before  the  application  was
    made.

10. 352D(iii) requires that the appellant is  not  leading  an  independent
    life, is unmarried and has not formed an independent family unit.

11. 352D(iv) is a separate requirement that the appellant was part  of  the
    family unit of the person granted asylum at the time  that  the  person
    granted asylum left the country of his habitual residence in  order  to
    seek asylum. That is the crucial issue in this appeal.

12. In the refusal decision of 21.12.12, the secretary  of  State  did  not
    accept that the appellant met either of those requirements.

13. The Secretary of State has not sought  to  challenge  the  decision  of
    Judge Manuel that the appellant meets 352D(iii).

14. The argument is that in finding at �20 and  �21  of  the  determination
    that the appellant meets the requirements of 352D(iii)  the  judge  was
    expressly or by implication also finding that  the  appellant  remained
    part of the family unit of the sponsor.

15. The judge referred to  NM  ("leading  an  independent  life")  Zimbabwe
    [2007] UKAIT 00051, a copy of which is in the appellant's bundle and  I
    have considered it.  It  held  that  in  order  to  establish  that  an
    application is not leading an independent life, he must not have formed
    through choice a separate (and therefore independent) social unit  from
    his parents' family unit whether alone or with others. At �13  of  that
    decision the Upper Tribunal panel considered the meaning of Independent
    life, pointing out that the Rule  did  not  require  the  child  to  be
    independent of everyone, just independent  of  the  parents,  at  which
    point the underlying purpose of the Rule was  no  longer  engaged.  The
    panel agreed that it was a  matter  of  assessing  the  nature  of  the
    choices made by the child and whether by choice the child has separated
    from his parents' family to form his own social unit, whether alone, by
    marrying or as part of his own independent social unit. It is  not  the
    same as saying he is no longer dependant on the parents  or  no  longer
    part of the family. The family ties remain  even  if  the  family  unit
    headed by the parents has now split up.

16. At �15 the panel stated that where the child lives is no  more  than  a
    factor (albeit a potentially significant one) to be taken into account.
    The panel could readily foresee situations where  the  child  may  live
    away from that home whilst still remaining part of the parents'  social
    unit, for example whilst temporarily away studying at college.  At  �21
    on the facts of that case, the panel accepted that although  the  child
    had lived away from the family unit for several  months,  her  evidence
    that it was only  temporary  until  they  obtained  a  larger  home  to
    accommodate all the family.

17. Judge Manuel carefully considered this authority in the  light  of  her
    findings of fact and found that it could not be said that the appellant
    was leading an independent life because she  herself  did  not  make  a
    choice at the age of 6 to live with her step-grandmother; that decision
    was made by her parents when her grandmother wanted to adopt her.

18. It does not follow, however, that the judge was also finding  that  the
    appellant was not part of  a  social  unit  separate  to  that  of  her
    parents; the rule does not refer to a social unit. It is quite possible
    to  foresee  circumstances  where  a  child  has  not  chosen  to  live
    independently of the parents  but  that  has  been  imposed  upon  her,
    without her choice, and thus not an independent choice, yet she was  no
    longer part of the family unit of the sponsor at the time he  left  his
    home country. It is clear from �21  of  the  determination  that  Judge
    Manuel's decision in respect of 352D(iii) was based on the  absence  of
    choice.

19. I therefore reject Ms Johnrose's primary submission that the finding in
    favour of  the  appellant  in  relation  to  352D(iii)  is  necessarily
    inconsistent with the finding  against  the  appellant  in  respect  of
    352D(iv). Such an argument  makes  no  sense  when  it  is  clear  that
    352D(iii) is an entirely separate consideration to 352D(iv). It  cannot
    be that a finding in relation to 352D(iii) determines  the  outcome  in
    relation to 352D(iv).

20. In considering paragraph 352D(iv) and whether the appellant was part of
    the family unit when her father left to seek asylum, Judge  Manuel  set
    out between �22 and �27 her reasons for finding that she was  not  pare
    of his family unit.

21. Ms Johnrose also submitted that Judge Manuel  either  ignored  relevant
    evidence or failed to place proper weight on aspects of the evidence in
    support of the appellant. However, I find that on a careful reading  of
    the determination  it  is  clear  that  Judge  Manuel  made  a  careful
    assessment of the evidence before reaching findings of  fact,  which  I
    find were open to her on the evidence before her.

22. I accept that the fact that the appellant lived apart from the  parents
    is one factor to consider, even  though  a  significant  one,  and  not
    necessarily determinative of the issue. There  may  be  reasons  why  a
    child lives away from the family home for periods of time. Equally, the
    fact that a child may still be considered part of the family  and  have
    contact with family members does not necessarily mean  that  the  child
    remains part of the family unit. A child reaching maturity and  setting
    up their own home away from the family home is still part of the family
    and may retain close personal ties  although  no  longer  part  of  the
    family unit of the father.

23. However, in this case there was evidently a very deliberate decision to
    send the appellant to live with her step-grandmother on  an  indefinite
    basis. Reasons were cited in different parts of the evidence  that  the
    mother could not cope  and  more  significantly  that  the  grandmother
    wanted to adopt the child, and that both parents have stated that  they
    were willing for that  to  happen  and  never  sought  to  change  that
    arrangement, because the child was settled. Thus the grandmother raised
    the appellant for the past 11 years or so.

24. Judge Manuel took account of all the evidence, but  it  is  clear  that
    some parts of the evidence she did not accept. The judge also took into
    account the lack of contact between the appellant and the father over a
    number of years. They went to Kenya for 8 years and did nothing to have
    the appellant join them there, although they were apparently living  in
    a refugee camp.

25. Considering the evidence and the determination as a whole I  find  that
    the conclusion reached that the appellant  had  failed  to  demonstrate
    that she was part of the family unit of the father at the time he  left
    to seek asylum is one which the judge was entitled  to  reach  and  for
    which cogent reasons have been given. It should be remembered that this
    test of part of the family unit at the time the father left his country
    to seek asylum is not the same as saying that she is not still a family
    member who may qualify under paragraph 297, as she had been  found  not
    to be leading an independent life. However, that is a  matter  for  the
    appellant and her family members to consider. I simply point  out  that
    the tests and requirements are different that those under 352D and  for
    good reason the financial requirements of 297  are  not  applicable  in
    352D, when what is intended is  a  reunion  of  the  family  unit  that
    existed at the time the asylum seeker left his home country in order to
    seek asylum.

26. In the circumstances,  I  find  no  error  of  law  in  Judge  Manuel's
    conclusion that on the facts of this case  she  was  not  part  of  the
    family unit at that time.

27. In relation to article 8, private and family life it was accepted  that
    the appellant could not meet the requirements under Appendix FM.

28. Under the current law,  the  appellant  would  have  to  show  arguably
    compelling   circumstances   insufficiently   recognised   under    the
    Immigration Rules in order to justify,  exceptionally,  granting  entry
    clearance outside the Rules on the basis that the decision produces  an
    unjustifiably harsh outcome.

29. Briefly, recent authority is to the effect that the  Immigration  Rules
    are a complete code and there is no need  to  look  outside  the  Rules
    unless there are arguably good grounds for consideration that there are
    compelling circumstances not adequately recognised in the Rules,  which
    render the decision of the Secretary of State  unjustifiably  harsh.  I
    set out below a summary of some of the recent case law.

30. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the Court of  Appeal  held
    that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a
    complete code but involve the application of  a  proportionality  test.
    Whether that is done within the new rules or outside the new  rules  as
    part of the article 8 general law was described as a sterile  question,
    as either way the result should be the same. MF (Nigeria) was  followed
    in Kabia (MF: para 398 - "exceptional circumstances") 2013  UKUT  00569
    (IAC).

31. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) has set out, inter  alia,  that  on  the  current  state  of  the
    authorities:

         (a)     the  maintenance  requirements  of  E-LTRP.3.1-3.2   stand,
             although Blake J in R (on the application of MM)  v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said
             that they could constitute an unjustified and disproportionate
             interference with the ability of spouses to live together;  he
             suggested that an appropriate figure may  be  around  �13,400,
             and highlighted the position of  young  people  and  low  wage
             earners caught by the higher figure in the rules;

         (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if  there
             may be arguably good grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
             outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to  go  on
             to consider whether there  are  compelling  circumstances  not
             sufficiently recognised under them: R (on the application  of)
             Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC
             720 (Admin);

         (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in  provisions  such  as
             Section  EX.1  are  not  obstacles  which  are  impossible  to
             surmount: MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393
             (IAC); Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC);
             they concern the practical possibilities of relocation. In the
             absence of such insurmountable obstacles, it is  necessary  to
             show other non-standard and particular features  demonstrating
             that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.

32. It is illustrative that in Gulshan the Upper Tribunal  considered  that
    it was not unduly harsh for a husband who originated from Pakistan  but
    was now a British national, to return to Pakistan with his wife who was
    seeking leave to remain as his spouse. The panel acknowledged that  the
    couple would suffer some hardship, as he had been in the UK since 2002,
    he had worked here and was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and
    other state benefits,  some  of  which  could  not  be  transferred  to
    Pakistan.

33. More recently, in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:

         (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to  identify  in
             her decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR
             does not prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so  on
             the basis of the materials before it.

          (ii)   "Maintenance of effective immigration control"  whilst  not
             as such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of  the  ECHR  can
             normally be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of
             disorder or crime" or an aspect of "economic well-being of the
             country" or both.

           (iii)    "[P]revention  of  disorder  or  crime"  is  normally  a
             legitimate aim both in expulsion cases where  there  has  been
             criminal conduct on the part of the claimant and in  expulsion
             cases where there have only been breaches of immigration law.

          (iv)    MF (Nigeria) [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  held  that  the  new
             immigration rules regarding deportation of a foreign  criminal
             are  a  complete  code.  This  was  because  of  the   express
             requirement in  them  at  paragraph  398  to  have  regard  to
             exceptional circumstances and other factors.

          (v)   It follows from this that any other rule which has a similar
             provision will also constitute a complete code;

          (vi)    Where an area of the rules does not have such  an  express
             mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for
             the Home Department [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  ([29]-[31]  in
             particular) and Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
             approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after
             applying the requirements of the rules, only if there  may  be
             arguably good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside
             them is it necessary for  Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to
             consider  whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not
             sufficiently recognised under them.

34. It is clear that the determination does not address any of these issues
    and does not in  any  way  justify  the  exceptional  consideration  of
    private and family life under article 8 ECHR  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules by reference to compelling circumstances. However, no  ground  of
    appeal has been raised in respect of that. If the decision  had  to  be
    set aside and remade, the appellant would struggle to demonstrate  that
    her circumstances are so compelling. The decision does not  change  the
    status quo  created  by  the  parents  when  they  agreed  to  let  the
    grandmother adopt the appellant at the age of 6. That there has been no
    formal adoption is neither here nor there. On  the  findings  of  Judge
    Manuel the grandmother has raised the appellant and she is settled with
    her.

35. The article 8 exercise conducted outside the Immigration Rules by Judge
    Manuel  was  by  reference  to  the  Razgar  steps,  from  �28  of  the
    determination onwards. The judge properly went through those steps  and
    in doing so, accepted that family life existed  between  the  appellant
    and her parents and siblings and that the refusal decision  amounts  to
    an interference with private and family life.

36. As is usually the case, the crucial issue was that of  proportionality.
    The absence of the appellant from the family unit since she was 6 years
    of age; that she was raised from that age by her grandmother until  the
    appellant is now 17 years of age and will be 18 in  November  2014  are
    matters properly taken into account. I also note that  the  judge  took
    account of evidence of some contact since 2012, together with financial
    support.

37. In my view, in the light of the factors for and against  the  appellant
    set out in the determination, not just after �28  (the  numbering  went
    awry after the Razgar steps were set out),  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    judge's conclusion at �39 that the decision was proportionate is one to
    which she was entitled to come in the light of her findings of fact and
    earlier conclusions in relation to the  Immigration  Rules.  It  was  a
    decision within the margin of appreciation open to a judge, even though
    a different judge  may  have  reached  a  different  conclusion.  I  am
    satisfied that as far as  the  article  8  decision  is  concerned  the
    grounds of appeal amount to  no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
    conclusions reached.

38. I should also add, that the  appellant  was  unable  to  bring  herself
    within the Immigration Rules is also a significant  factor  that  would
    have to be brought into account, together with the fact  that,  without
    prejudging the matter, there may  be  another  route  for  entry  as  a
    dependant child  under  other  provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules,
    dependant  on  evidence  to  satisfy  maintenance   and   accommodation
    requirements.

39. In the circumstances, I find no error of law in  the  determination  of
    Judge Manuel in respect of either the decision  under  the  Immigration
    Rules or that in  respect  of  private  and  family  life  outside  the
    Immigration Rules under article 8 ECHR.

Conclusion & Decision:

40. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  stands  and  the  appeal
remains dismissed.
