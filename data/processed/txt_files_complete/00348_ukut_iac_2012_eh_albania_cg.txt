                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Collins, instructed by Howe & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss C Gough, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


   1. While there remain a number of active blood feuds in Albania, they are
      few and declining.  There  are  a  small  number  of  deaths  annually
      arising from those feuds and a small number  of  adults  and  children
      living in self-confinement for protection.  Government  programmes  to
      educate  self-confined  children  exist  but  very  few  children  are
      involved in them.

   2. The existence of a 'modern blood feud' is not established: Kanun blood
      feuds have always allowed for the possibility of  pre-emptive  killing
      by a dominant clan.

   3. The Albanian state has taken steps to improve state protection, but in
      areas where Kanun law predominates (particularly in northern  Albania)
      those steps do not yet provide sufficiency of protection  from  Kanun-
      related  blood-taking  if  an  active  feud  exists  and  affects  the
      individual claimant.  Internal relocation to an area of  Albania  less
      dependent on the Kanun may provide sufficient protection, depending on
      the reach, influence, and commitment to prosecution of the feud by the
      aggressor clan.

   4. International protection under the Refugee  Convention,  Qualification
      Directive or Articles 2 and 3 ECHR is not available  to  an  appellant
      who is willing and intends to commit a revenge killing  on  return  to
      his country of origin, by reference to that intention.

   5. Where there is an  active  feud  affecting  an  individual  and  self-
      confinement is the only option, that person will normally qualify  for
      Refugee status.

   6. In determining whether an active blood feud exists,  the  fact-finding
      Tribunal should consider:

       (i)  the history of the alleged feud, including the notoriety of  the
      original killings, the numbers killed, and the degree of commitment by
      the aggressor clan toward the prosecution of the feud;

      (ii)  the length of time since the last death and the relationship  of
      the last person killed to the appellant;

      (iii) the ability of members of  the  aggressor  clan  to  locate  the
      appellant if returned to another part of Albania; and

      (iv)  the past and likely future attitude  of  the  police  and  other
      authorities towards the feud and the protection of the family  of  the
      person claiming to be at risk, including any  past  attempts  to  seek
      prosecution of members of the aggressor clan, or  to  seek  protection
      from the Albanian authorities.

   7. In order to establish that there is an active blood feud affecting him
      personally, an appellant must produce satisfactory individual evidence
      of its existence in relation to him.   In  particular,  the  appellant
      must establish:

        i) his profile as a potential target of  the  feud  identified  and
           which family carried out the most recent killing; and

      (ii)  whether the appellant has been, or other members of  his  family
      have been, or are currently, in self-confinement within Albania.

   8.  Attestation  letters  from  Albanian  non-governmental  organisations
      should not  in  general  be  regarded  as  reliable  evidence  of  the
      existence of a feud.

   9. Documents originating from the Albanian courts, police or  prosecution
      service, if genuine, may assist in establishing  the  existence  of  a
      blood feud at the date of the document relied  upon,  subject  to  the
      test of reliability set out in A v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
      Department (Pakistan) [2002] UKIAT 00439, [2002] Imm A R 318  (Tanveer
      Ahmed).

  10. Unless factual, prompt and consistent, Albanian press reports will add
      little or no evidential weight in considering whether a feud exists.

  11. Whether the feud continues and what the attitude of the aggressor clan
      to its pursuit may be will remain questions of fact to  be  determined
      by the fact-finding Tribunal.

  12. This guidance replaces that contained in TB (Blood  feuds  -  relevant
      risk factors) Albania CG [2004] UKIAT 000158.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The appellant is an Albanian citizen, who entered the United  Kingdom  in
   January 2009 when he was just 17 years old.   He is now 20 years old.  He
   appeals against the respondent's decision to make removal  directions  to
   Albania after refusing him refugee recognition,  humanitarian  protection
   or leave to remain on human rights grounds.  This decision is anonymised.
    For clarity, we have referred to the appellant's family as Clan  H,  and
   the opposing family as Clan G.

Country guidance issues

2. The Upper Tribunal has not so far issued country guidance on blood  feuds
   in Albania. The question was last  examined  by  the  Immigration  Appeal
   Tribunal (IAT) in TB (Blood feuds - relevant  risk  factors)  Albania  CG
   [2004] UKIAT 00158, in which the IAT held that the risk to  an  appellant
   should be assessed against the factual matrix of the particular case.

3. The issues identified for the present appeal were  whether  the  list  of
   likely risk factors  in  TB  remained  valid;  whether  there  existed  a
   separate, non-Kanun 'modern blood feud' leading to  risks  even  for  the
   males of the avenger family; and whether an attestation letter signed  by
   Mr Gjin Marku the Chairman of the Commission for National  Reconciliation
   (the  CNR)  should  be  regarded  as  determinative  of   an   individual
   appellant's appeal, alternatively what weight should be given to  such  a
   document.

4. We have had an opportunity to hear from Mr Marku.  The CNR is one of  the
   largest and best known of the non-governmental organisations  in  Albania
   providing attestation  letters  in  relation  to  individuals  and  their
   involvement in blood feuds.

Key concepts in Albanian blood feuds

5. The following definitions and  concepts  have  been  extracted  from  the
   evidence before us.  For  consistency,  where  there  is  more  than  one
   translation of a concept in use, we indicate the one which will  be  used
   in this determination.

     i) Attestation letters. Also known as 'blood  feud  certificates'  and
        'reconciliation  certificates'   (although   in   fact   they   are
        certificates  of  non-reconciliation).  Many  appellants  rely   on
        letters from one or other of the  reconciliation  organisations  in
        Albania, certifying the existence of an active blood feud which may
        affect the person named in the letter.

    ii)  Albanian Foundation for Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation  of
        Disputes  (AFCR)  www.mediationalb.org.   Funded  by  international
        organisations and  accepts  no  payment  for  attestation  letters.
        Reconciled 130 criminal conflicts in the year to June 2010.

   iii) Besa (Forgiveness). A ceasefire in a gjakmarrja feud, during  which
        those at risk may carry  out  urgent  family  business,  or  attend
        family events such as weddings or funerals.  A  besa  may  be  time
        limited or may represent a permanent reconciliation and  resolution
        of the feud, usually following a financial or land settlement.

    iv)  Commission  for  National  Reconciliation  (CNR)  www.pajtimi.com.
        Sometimes translated as  'Campaign  for  National  Reconciliation'.
        The CNR is a blood feud reconciliation  organisation  which  has  a
        national structure, and a significant international  profile.   The
        CNR does not accept international  funding,  relying  on  donations
        from those for whom it mediates.  It has  local  offices  all  over
        Albania.   The CNR Chairman, Gjin Marku, is solely responsible  for
        issuing its attestation letters.

     v)      Gjakmarrja ('Blood-taking'). A vendetta, or blood feud,  which
        may have lasted for decades, or may be recent  in  origin.   It  is
        closely  linked  to  collectivist  notions  of  family,   or   clan
        solidarity and reliability.  A blood debt carries a related loss of
        honour which can only be restored by the taking of blood  from  the
        other family.  It is generally borne by the males  of  the  nuclear
        family, parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren.

        Typically, a feud begins with a killing or offence by an individual
        from Clan A, which must be revenged by a senior  male  figure  from
        Clan B.  When revenge has been carried out by Clan  B,  Clan  A  is
        required to retaliate by killing  a  Clan  B  member,  and  so  on,
        potentially to the extinction of all male members  of  both  clans.
        Children under 15 and women are not usually required either to kill
        or be killed, except perhaps where a woman  is  the  cause  of  the
        feud, or the last surviving member of the target clan.

    vi) Hakmarrja ('debt-taking'). Revenge or honour killing in  a  broader
        context, or even killings between gangs and other criminal murders.
         The honour of a particular  clan  is  not  necessarily  at  stake.
        Hakmarrja killings can include those between members  of  the  same
        family on 'honour' grounds, for example where a husband  kills  his
        wife or a father his son.

   vii) Kanun law.     Ancient Albanian system of local justice, thought to
        date back in oral form to the Bronze Age,  first  codified  in  the
        15th century by Lek� Dukagjini.  Its full title is the Kanun i Leke
        Dukagjinit and it  has  four  pillars:  Nderi  (honour);  Mikpritja
        (hospitality); Sjellja (right conduct) and Fis (kin loyalty).   The
        Kanun was published for the first time, partially, in 1913, and  in
        full in 1933, based on research by Shtjef�n  Gje�ovi.   It  has  12
        books and 1252 articles, covering all aspects of conduct of  family
        and business life.

  viii) Missionaries.  Village elders and other respected persons who  will
        be approached to reconcile a  blood  feud.  Also  known  as  'peace
        missionaries'.

    ix)        Self-confinement.    Also  known  as   self-isolation,   the
        practice of males in a target family staying indoors, sometimes for
        years, as a mark of respect and recognition of the feelings of  the
        aggressor family.  A self-confined person will not  usually  be  at
        risk in their home, although that is not completely certain.

The appellant's account

6. The appellant's case on entry  was  that  the  risk  to  him  arose  from
   perceived or actual political opinion as a  family  member  of  his  late
   father, due to his father's connection with the Albanian Socialist  Party
   (the ASP).  He used to attend meetings of the ASP with his father.  A man
   was said to have warned the appellant's father to  stop  taking  part  in
   socialist politics. In June 2007, his father was shot  and  killed  by  a
   local police officer, a cousin of the person who was said to have  warned
   his father to desist from politics. The appellant  left  Albania  a  year
   later, in July 2008, travelling via Kosovo, Italy,  and  France,  finally
   arriving in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2009. He claimed asylum  two
   days later, on the basis of perceived political  opinion,  based  on  his
   membership of his father's family.

7. There has been only one killing, the shooting of  his  father:   however,
   both the man who warned his father to get out of socialist politics,  and
   the policeman who shot him, were members of Clan G.

8. At the First-tier Tribunal hearing, the  appellant  modified  his  claim,
   formulating what had occurred as a blood feud.  He now said that  he  had
   spent the year before leaving Albania in strict self-confinement and  was
   at risk of killing on return by the aggressor clan or of social  pressure
   to carry out a revenge killing himself.  Since the next death is  in  the
   hands of Clan H, the  appellant's  family,  the  obvious  solution  would
   appear to be that he  should  not  carry  out  a  revenge  killing.   His
   father's brothers have not done so and have distanced themselves from the
   feud, if it exists.

9.  The  appellant  contends  that  the  traditional  blood  feud  has  been
   overtaken by a newer variant, the  'modern'  blood  feud,  in  which  the
   aggressor family undertakes pre-emptive killings  of  a  number  of  male
   members of the victim family, or even  women  or  children,  rather  than
   waiting  to  see  whether  the  victim  family  would  retaliate  in  the
   traditional way for the original death.  This is said to be the behaviour
   of dominant clans.  His case is  that  Clan  G  are  dominant  and  well-
   connected.  On that analysis, the appellant contends that if he  were  to
   return to  Albania  he  would  have  to  go  back  into  self-confinement
   indefinitely or face death at the hands of Clan G.

Refusal letter

10. The respondent disbelieved the  appellant's  original  account  of  risk
   based on perceived political opinion and refused asylum.  The  letter  of
   refusal criticised  the  appellant  for  having  very  limited,  if  any,
   knowledge of the ASP; and in particular,  not  knowing  what  'socialism'
   meant.  The respondent rejected any suggestion  that  the  death  of  the
   appellant's father, if  it  took  place,  was  linked  to  his  socialist
   politics as the appellant had claimed.  The  respondent  considered  that
   there was sufficiency of protection against a  rogue  police  officer  in
   Albania, even if the appellant's account were true, and she  also  placed
   weight on his failure to claim asylum in Italy or France.  The respondent
   rejected the appellant's  humanitarian  protection  claim  for  the  same
   reason and, after consideration of paragraph 395C of the Rules,  she  did
   not consider that his removal to Albania would be disproportionate.

First-tier Tribunal decision

11. The appellant appealed to the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal,  arguing
   that the risk should be considered as  one  of  blood  feud  rather  than
   political opinion, perceived or actual.  In November 2009,  the  Tribunal
   dismissed his appeal.  The Tribunal did not accept that  the  appellant's
   revised core account was credible, even to the lower standard  applicable
   to the international  protection  Conventions,  and  in  particular,  the
   Immigration Judge rejected the claim that the appellant was  at  risk  of
   pre-emptive killing by the aggressor family, Clan G.

12. In particular, the Tribunal noted that despite the appellant's claim  to
   have  been  in  self-confinement,  he  had  told  Mr  Martin  Heyward,  a
   consultant treating him for  a  parasitic  disease  usually  caught  from
   sheep, that he had contact with sheep from the age of 15, until  he  left
   Albania.  The Judge considered that to be incompatible with an account of
   having been self-confined and not leaving his house.

13. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered that  even  if  there  were  an
   active feud  involving  the  appellant,  there  was  now  sufficiency  of
   protection for him  from  the  Albanian  authorities.   The  humanitarian
   protection and human rights claims fell with the asylum claim.

Grounds of appeal

14. The appellant sought reconsideration of that decision, arguing that:

     (a)   he had not changed his account, rather, that it was the analysis
           of the claim which had been reappraised;
     (b)   the determination had been fatally flawed by bias on the part of
           the Immigration Judge who heard the appeal;
     (c)   the Tribunal had erred in failing to adjourn for the  production
           of  four  critical  original  documents,  which  were   in   the
           respondent's possession;
     (d)   insufficient scrutiny had been given to the expert  evidence  of
           Dr Stephanie Schwandner-Sievers, which the  respondent  had  not
           challenged at the hearing;
     (e)   insufficient weight was given to press reports of  his  father's
           death from Shqip and Shekulli newspapers, which  Dr  Schwandner-
           Sievers considered to be genuine, based on her research;
     (f)   too much weight was given to the evidence of Mr  Martin  Hayward
           that the appellant had a medical  condition  which  was  usually
           caught from sheep and had told  Mr  Hayward  that  he  had  been
           'working with sheep since the age of 15' as probative of his not
           having lived in self-confinement as claimed; and that
     (g)   the Tribunal had erred in law in holding that a blood feud could
           not come within the ambit of the Refugee Convention,  following,
           in particular, AN and NN (Albania) v Secretary of State for  the
           Home Department [2007] UKAIT 00097.

Procedural matters

15. Reconsideration was granted by the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  in
   December 2009, on all grounds.  Directions were given at a hearing on  22
   July 2010, requiring the respondent to disclose the  original  documents,
   and any verification report relied upon.  The grounds  were  accepted  by
   the respondent as disclosing errors of law, such that the appeal would be
   reheard afresh. This appeal was identified as  potentially  suitable  for
   country guidance on the present risks from  blood  feuds  in  Albania.  A
   transfer order has been made, the effect of which  is  that  this  appeal
   falls to be re-made by this panel of the Upper Tribunal.

16. The Upper Tribunal heard the oral evidence of the appellant, his  cousin
   Ms EN, and Dr Schwandner-Sievers on 7 December 2010, and received from Mr
   Marku on behalf of the CNR an attestation letter purporting  to  evidence
   the appellant's involvement in a blood feud.

17. Both  parties  were  given  leave  to  make  written  submissions.   The
   respondent did so promptly, arguing that  the  appellant's  evidence  was
   totally lacking in credibility and that no weight should be placed on the
   attestation letter from the CNR or the written evidence of Mr Marku.

18. On 16 December 2010, Mr Collins applied to the Tribunal  for  permission
   to call oral evidence from Mr Marku regarding the process underlying  CNR
   attestation letters, and whether the particular  letter  relied  upon  in
   these proceedings was genuine and/or probative of a relevant  blood  feud
   affecting the appellant, which he accepted would  be  very  important  in
   assessing the appellant's claim, given the difficulties with  credibility
   identified in the respondent's submissions.

19. At a directions hearing on 14  January  2011,  the  Tribunal  agreed  to
   allow Mr Marku to be called, either by his attendance at a hearing in the
   United  Kingdom  or  by  video  link  from  Albania.   There   was   then
   considerable difficulty in obtaining  dates  suitable  for  Mr  Marku  to
   appear by either method.  His evidence was eventually taken at a  hearing
   on 27 September  2011  at  which  he  was  present.   Mr  Collins'  final
   submissions were expected after the hearing, but there was then a further
   development.

20. In December 2011, Mr Marku was arrested and questioned by  the  Albanian
   authorities regarding the issue of false attestation letters by  the  CNR
   under his signature.  Mr Marku was not detained, but our understanding is
   that the investigation continues. In January 2012, as soon as  he  became
   aware of it,  Mr  Collins  drew  the  arrest  and  investigation  to  the
   attention of the Tribunal and sought a further oral hearing.  We did  not
   consider that to be necessary but we gave the parties an  opportunity  to
   file further evidence and submissions dealing with the  investigation  of
   Mr Marku and the CNR.

21. The appellant's closing submissions were received on 13  February  2012,
   and the respondent's reply and further submissions were  received  on  21
   April 2012.  Although there has been considerable delay in the production
   of the determination after receipt of  these  submissions,  that  related
   only to the weight to be given to Mr Marku's evidence and whether it  was
   affected by the criminal investigation.   The  appellant's  evidence  was
   unsatisfactory and we had concluded  after  the  original  hearing  that,
   absent the CNR attestation letter evidencing the claimed  blood  feud  in
   his family, we would not have found his account credible.

   including that concerning Mr Marku's activities and the investigation  in
   Albania.

Submissions

Respondent's submissions and evidence regarding Mr Marku

23. The respondent's closing  submissions  were  submitted  on  14  December
   2010, after the original oral hearing.  Ms Gough argued that K and Fornah
   did not apply to this appeal and that members of a family  subject  to  a
   blood feud were not capable of constituting  a  particular  social  group
   under the Refugee Convention.   She relied on the decision of  the  Court
   of Appeal in Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  v  Skenderaj
   [2002] EWCA Civ 567, on dicta  from  an  unidentified  paragraph  in  the
   Asylum and Immigration Tribunal's determination in SB (PSG  -  Protection
   Regulations - Reg 6) Moldova CG [2008] UKAIT 0002, and on paragraphs  59-
   66 of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal of Australia (RRTA)  in
   0908334 [2010] RRTA 210 (30 March 2010).  She sought to resile  from  the
   contrary position adopted by the Secretary of State in AN and NN (s.83  -
   asylum grounds only) Albania [2007] UKAIT 00097.

24. In relation to internal relocation, the respondent did not dispute  that
   there was still a blood feud problem in  Albania,  albeit  following  the
   evidence of Dr Schwandner-Sievers, she contended  that  the  problem  had
   improved in recent years.  After setting out the relevant elements of the
   country materials, she argued that the situation had improved to such  an
   extent that there now existed sufficient protection for those at risk and
   the international protection Conventions were therefore not engaged.

25. We considered that the respondent should have an opportunity to  comment
   on the appellant's delayed closing submissions and the new evidence about
   Mr Marku and the CNR.  Ms Gough was unwell in February  and  March  2012:
   her submissions were received on 21 April 2012.   The RRTA had found that
   sufficiency of protection existed and she relied  upon  the  analysis  in
   their judgment.

26. Corruption remained an issue:  Albania now had an  anti-corruption  task
   force, but the risk of corruption was still at  a  level  which  rendered
   unverified attestation  letters  unreliable.   The  Tribunal  should  not
   regard such documents as adding any weight to an otherwise unsatisfactory
   claim.

27. In relation to the availability of internal relocation as a solution  to
   any risk which might exist, Ms Gough submitted that the power, reach  and
   commitment of the  aggressor  clan  must  be  shown  to  have  nationwide
   presence in order to establish that internal relocation would  be  either
   ineffective or unreasonable in the sense that  it  would  lead  to  self-
   confinement.  She relied on paragraph 3.6.9 of the  respondent's  Albania
   OGN for 2010 in support of this proposition.

28. Turning to the appellant's individual account, Ms Gough  submitted  that
   it lacked credibility and that the supporting  documentary  evidence  did
   not establish that the death of the appellant's father was  feud-related,
   whether an old or a new feud.  The appellant was not a witness  of  truth
   and  had  not  established  a  risk  on  return  engaging   international
   protection.   There had been no attack on other family members  since  he
   left Albania and even if the appellant had been recognised in France,  as
   he claimed, he had been able to remain there for a  further  five  months
   without coming to harm or any obvious interest  by  the  aggressor  clan.
   The expert evidence of Dr Schwandner-Sievers  did  not  support  anything
   other than local influence for the aggressor  clan,  such  that  internal
   relocation would be available if there were,  indeed,  any  risk  to  the
   appellant on return.

29. The respondent was given an opportunity to respond  to  the  appellant's
   late-submitted final submissions, and in particular,  to  deal  with  the
   situation regarding Mr Marku.  Ms Gough's further  submissions  indicated
   that the respondent had sought corroboration and/or clarification of  the
   position regarding Mr Marku and the CIRB from government  sources  within
   Albania.

30. Ms Gough  relied  on  the  latest  CIRB  Response  in  relation  to  the
   difficulties Mr Marku had experienced in Albania, and on the  submissions
   made by her in December 2010.  In addition, Ms Gough submitted  that  the
   documents indicated:

      "...an investigation being carried out on Mr Marku by the  authorities
      in Albania, with support and assistance from the Belgian  authorities.
      There is also reference to charges having been made.  Mr Marku's  oral
      evidence itself referred to the request from the  Belgian  authorities
      for record keeping information, which supports  the  above  submission
      and those within the previous submissions on behalf of  the  Secretary
      of State, which is that the evidence generally provided  by  Mr  Marku
      cannot be relied upon.

      In the absence of comment from Mr Marku himself  or  evidence  to  the
      contrary, it is further  submitted  that  [the  appellant's]  case  is
      adversely affected in addition.  The appellant sought to  adduce  very
      late evidence from Mr Marku to  support  what  was  otherwise  a  weak
      claim.  No further support or evidence of records have  been  provided
      by the CNR, only Mr Marku's oral  evidence  and  notes,  which  raises
      serious concerns, especially in light of the fresh  evidence  relating
      to Mr Marku's unreliability.  The  primary  submission  is  that  when
      viewed in the round, and in light of other significant inconsistencies
      with the claim, the principles within Tanveer Ahmed should  apply  and
      no weight be placed on this evidence.

      I will forward any information received from the Albanian  authorities
      as soon as I receive it."

31. She argued that there was no reliable evidence such as  passport  copies
   or tickets to support Mr Marku's claim to have been in the United Kingdom
   at the time of the alleged arrest, nor  any  evidence  from  the  Belgian
   authorities which supported his account.  Mr Marku's evidence to the CIRB
   was inconsistent with that which he had given to the Upper  Tribunal  and
   should be regarded as fatally damaged by his admission to the  CIRB  that
   he was aware of occasions when false attestations bearing  his  signature
   had issued from the CNR, and also by the existence of a video,  noted  by
   the CIRB, in which he was seen coaching a family on a  false  blood  feud
   claim,  and  charging  a  significant  amount  of  money  for   a   false
   attestation.

32. Ms Gough submitted that the Tribunal should  find  Mr  Marku  to  be  an
   unreliable witness and should dismiss the appeal.

Appellant's submissions

33. The appellant's closing submissions dated 13 February 2012  argued  that
   persons  subject  to  blood  feuds  within  Albania   were   capable   of
   constituting a particular social group.  We have taken into  account  the
   lengthy submissions made by Mr Collins thereon:  for the reasons set  out
   below, we do not consider it necessary to rehearse  them here.

34. The appellant accepted that there were  difficulties  with  his  account
   and that it was not entirely consistent, internally  or  with  the  other
   evidence before the Tribunal.  However, he contended  that  the  Tribunal
   should find his account at least partially credible, in  that  we  should
   accept as a Chiver core that:

      (i)   The Appellant was the son of SH and a member of Clan H;
      (ii)  The Appellant's father was killed on 19th April 2007;
      (iii)      The Appellant's father was killed by AG of Clan G;
      (iv)  The aggressor AG is or was a police officer;
      (v)   The Appellant self-confined for  a  period  after  his  father's
           death;
      (vi)  Having ventured  out  of  the  family  home  the  Appellant  was
           subsequently seen and threatened by AG;
      (vii)       A blood feud exists between Clan G and  Clan  H  and  that
           such blood feud was of a pre-emptive nature;
      (viii)      Attempts had been made by the CNR  at  reconciliation  but
           had been unsuccessful;
      (ix)  There existed no adequate  sufficiency  of  protection  for  the
           Appellant in Albania;
      (x)   The Appellant would be at risk in his home area if  he  did  not
           self-confine; and that
      (xi)  The Appellant would not be able to relocate for safety elsewhere
           within Albania.

35. Mr Collins asked the Tribunal to allow the appeal.

The evidence

36. We first considered the weight to be attached to the  evidence  from  Dr
   Schwandner-Sievers and Mr Marku.

Dr Stephanie Schwandner-Sievers' evidence

37. Dr Schwandner-Sievers has assisted the  IAT,  the  AIT,  and  the  Upper
   Tribunal  on  many  occasions  as  an  expert  witness.   She  has   been
   undertaking research into the broader phenomenon of  the  blood  feud  in
   Albania and her evidence is set  out  more  fully  at  Appendix  C.   She
   confirmed that  there  continued  to  be  a  problem  with  self-confined
   families and blood feuds in Albania.   The  risk  was  to  those  in  the
   patrilineal blood line, with children being disregarded until  they  were
   old enough to be a threat.  The risk to women was much  less  since  they
   had a different bloodline.

38. Pre-emptive killing was not new: it had always been 'part of  the  game'
   and the prime targets were the deceased's brothers and sons.  There  were
   pressures to take revenge, but also pressures to keep the  peace  and  to
   forgive.  It  was  impossible  to  be  certain  of  the  level  of  self-
   confinement.  The Albanian state was weak and the judiciary corrupt; many
   people trusted the Kanun more than they trusted the Albanian authorities.
    Internal relocation was not a solution in a small country like  Albania.



39. The CNR was problematic and its attestation  letters  could  be  bought.
   Mr Marku had a personal monopoly on the issuing of such  letters  by  the
   CNR and, although she had no direct  evidence,  she  considered  it  very
   possible that he was corrupt.  She  considered  that  the  assessment  by
   Special Rapporteur Philip Alston for the  UNHCR  was  overoptimistic  and
   that by Mr Marku exaggerated the levels and risks of blood feuds.

40. Dealing with the appellant's case, she had  discovered  reports  of  the
   killing of his father in the course of her research. There had  been  two
   national press reports and a press release immediately after  his  father
   was shot.  They did not accord factually with the appellant's account  of
   what had happened but she considered that as he had been relatively young
   at the time (15 years old) that might be capable of explanation.  In  her
   opinion, it was impossible to be certain, given the levels of  corruption
   in Albania, that the press reports had not been faked.

41. However, she had also come across a  District  Prosecutor's  Order  from
   the right town in Albania, dated  16  May  2007,  which  she  had  traced
   herself from the newspaper reports and which confirmed  the  shooting  of
   his father, and that the policeman who shot him had never been tried  for
   that killing.  Her opinion was that the  appellant's  father  had  indeed
   been shot by a policeman.

Special Rapporteur Alston's report

42. Professor Philip Alston's report on  blood  feuds  in  Albania  for  the
   UNHCR noted the 'deep discrepancies' in statistics regarding blood feuds,
   ranging between the government view  that  there  were  less  than  sixty
   killings a year, of which 29-45 were in Shkodra, with about 130  families
   in self-confinement nationally, and the view propounded by  the  CNR  and
   other non-governmental organisations, that there were hundreds of  deaths
   and thousands of self-confined children.  The problem was partly  one  of
   language, with some analyses using a  broader  definition  including  any
   revenge killing between  families  and  others  a  narrower,  traditional
   definition of premeditated 'taking of blood' by the victim family at  the
   other.  Non-governmental organisations had an incentive to overstate  the
   figures for funding  purposes;  rural  Albanians  probably  underreported
   instances  of  crime  in  their  area;  and  the  records  of  government
   programmes might be incomplete.  Overall, he tended  to  think  that  the
   lower government figures were likely to be more accurate and  that  blood
   feuds were a small and diminishing problem for the Albanian authorities.





Mr Gjin Marku's evidence

43.  Mr  Marku's  evidence,  and  that  of  the  CNR,  underpins   all   the
   international press reports and many of the  national  reports  too.   Mr
   Marku's position was that the  blood  feud  problem  was  widespread  and
   serious.  He stated that  blood  feuds  were  a  continuing  and  growing
   problem, with very many deaths and thousands of  self-confined  families;
   that the Kanun system had broken down, with murders taking place on  non-
   Kanun grounds treated as blood feuds, and that the CNR was the  only  NGO
   authorised to provide blood feud attestation letters.

44. Mr Marku's evidence was unimpressive, as a reading of Appendix  C  makes
   plain.  We heard a lengthy description of  his  network  of  contacts  in
   every village (which Dr Schwandner-Sievers acknowledged to be the  case),
   but he told us that his filing was chaotic with files  only  created  for
   some blood feuds and most reconciliations being  carried  out  informally
   over cigarettes, coffees, and long periods. That  was  inconsistent  with
   what Mr Marku told  the  Canadian  IRB  about  CNR's  filing  system  and
   methods:  the international sources record his stating that the CNR had a
   detailed filing system, with a file for every feud.

45. In his oral evidence it became clear  that  the  figures  he  used  were
   arrived at by adding up any records of violent deaths in newspapers, land
   disputes (based on information from the local Land Registries), and  even
   the killing of unfaithful wives by their husbands.  The definition  of  a
   blood feud used by Mr  Marku  was  excessively  wide  and  the  resultant
   statistics dubious.  At the end of Mr Marku's oral evidence in  September
   2011, we had formed the view that he  was  not  a  truthful  or  reliable
   witness and that rumours  of  attestation  letters  being  available  for
   payment from the CNR were likely to be correct.  We were not disposed  to
   place any weight on the attestation letter in this appeal.

46. We bore in mind that the CNR attestations were all signed personally  by
   Mr Marku:  the credibility of his account of their  preparation  and  the
   basis on which they were issued was therefore very important in assigning
   weight to any individual letter from the CNR.  A CIRB  Research  Response
   dated 1 February 2012 recorded Mr Marku as stating that he was  aware  of
   at least some occasions when his signature  on  attestation  letters  was
   forged. We also noted  the  existence  a  well-publicised  hidden  camera
   recording of Mr Marku offering to sell an attestation letter and coaching
   the family on the account to be given of their difficulties, without  any
   investigation of the claimed feud at all.

47. The subsequent arrest and investigation of Mr Marku and the CNR  by  the
   Albanian authorities  on  charges  of  selling  genuine  CNR  attestation
   letters for use abroad to support false asylum claims are compatible with
   our concerns about his credibility after  hearing  and  seeing  him  give
   evidence; but we emphasis that we had  already  independently  formed  an
   adverse view of his general credibility and the ultimate outcome  of  the
   criminal  charges  is,  therefore,  not  a  matter  that   requires   the
   finalisation of this determination to be further delayed.

The Canadian IRB Research Responses

48. The expressed view of the Albanian government  is  that  the  number  of
   live blood feuds is small and diminishing, and that the deaths which  can
   be attributed to such feuds are in  single  figures.   That  analysis  is
   accepted and adopted in the  Canadian  IRB  Research  Responses,  and  in
   analyses published by both the Australian RRT and  the  UKBA  Country  of
   Origin unit.  The Albanian government says that  the  Public  Prosecutor,
   police and courts  are  the  only  sources  of  attestation  of  properly
   investigated blood feuds.

49. We had the benefit of a number of IRB Research  Responses  from  Canada.
   They are  cumulative  and  show,  initially,  confidence  in  Mr  Marku's
   evidence, but increasingly, doubts about him, the  CNR,  and  attestation
   letters generally, by the Albanian and Belgian authorities in particular.



50. The February 1  CIRB  Research  Response  records  the  latest  research
   position and supersedes any earlier responses in  that  it  examines  the
   latest concerns in the context of the information obtained  and  used  in
   the previous responses.  The CIRB noted that:

      "Regarding the role of NGOs in mediating blood feuds, the Ministry  of
      Interior official explained that NGOs operate in accordance  with  the
      Constitution and the 1999 Law on Mediation (Albania 4 Jan. 2012).  The
      official   specifically   listed   the   Committee    of    Nationwide
      Reconciliation (CNR), the Mission of Feuds Reconciliation, the  League
      of Missionaries of Peace, the AFCR and  the  Center  for  Justice  and
      Peace  as  organizations  active  in  blood  feud  mediation  (ibid.).
      However, in response to a question about whether any NGOs are approved
      by the government to verify the authenticity of blood feuds, he  noted
      that NGOs "do  not  duplicate  the  powers  of  the  [c]ourt  and  the
      [p]rosecution [o]ffice" (ibid.)."

51. The Response continues:

      "4. Purchase of False Attestation Letters

      Various sources report that some  NGOs  have  issued  false  documents
      about blood feuds (Albania 2 Dec. 2011; AFCR 16 Dec. 2011; Belgium  29
      Nov. 2011, 4-8; Balkan Insight  5  Dec.  2011;  ibid.  27  Oct.  2011;
      Kohajone.com n.d). In response to an increase  in  blood-feud  related
      asylum claims in Belgium in September and October of 2011, the head of
      Belgium's Asylum and  Migration  Department  reportedly  claimed  that
      behind the individual  asylum  seekers  "is  an  entire  organisation,
      networks that provide documents and fake papers in exchange  for  huge
      amounts of money" (qtd. in AFP 18 Oct. 2011). According to the  Balkan
      Investigative Reporting  Network's  publication  Balkan  Insight,  the
      Belgian official met with Albanian  authorities  to  warn  them  about
      possible criminal networks (27 Oct. 2011).

      Balkan Insight found that some NGOs that claim to work for blood  feud
      reconciliation "routinely sell  families  documents  and  certificates
      saying they could become victims of a fatal vendetta if  they  do  not
      receive asylum ...," even in cases in which no feud or  murder  exists
      (Balkan Insight 27 Oct. 2011). ...

      A report by the Office of the Commissioner General  for  Refugees  and
      Stateless Persons (Commissariat g�n�ral aux r�fugi�s et aux apatrides)
      in Belgium cites information from the Albanian State Police report  to
      the effect that the Association of Peace  Reconciliation  Missionaries
      of Albania had also issued fraudulent attestation  letters  to  people
      who were not involved in any blood feuds (Belgium 29  Nov.  2011,  7).
      ...

      In addition, the Office of the Commissioner General for  Refugees  and
      Stateless Persons in Belgium, in a report about falsified documents in
      Albania, notes that  the  Albanian  television  program  "Fiks  Fare,"
      during a 27 October 2011 presentation, showed  the  president  of  the
      Peace Missionaries Union Albania, Pashko Toma, while being filmed with
      a hidden camera, accepting money for signing and stamping  a  document
      that was written by an  "'undercover'"  journalist  (Belgium  29  Nov.
      2011, 6). The president "explained to the journalist  that  he  issues
      similar attestation letters to Albanians from all over the country and
      that his secretary knows what to do when she  writes  these  kinds  of
      documents" (ibid.).

      The same television program showed Gjin Marku, also being filmed  with
      a hidden camera, accepting 300 Euros [392.144 CAD (XE 12  Jan.  2012)]
      in exchange for the issuance of an attestation letter and the creation
      of a "vendetta" file for a woman he met for the first time (Belgium 29
      Nov. 2011, 6). ...

      The Albanian Ministry of Interior has reportedly  established  a  task
      force to address the problem  of  counterfeit  documents  about  blood
      feuds used by asylum seekers (Sot.com 19 Dec. 2011). Both the Albanian
      police director (AFP 18 Oct. 2011; Belgium 29 Nov. 2011,  4)  and  the
      Minister of Interior (Sot.com 19 Dec. 2011) have  vowed  to  prosecute
      those who prepare such counterfeit documents (ibid.).

      According to the report of the Office of the Commissioner General  for
      Refugees and Stateless Persons in Belgium, [translation]  "considering
      ... the extent of corruption in Albania, it is impossible to  be  sure
      about  the  level  of  corruption  of  certain  organizations.  As   a
      consequence,  the  attempt  of  examining  the  authenticity   of   an
      attestation letter can not be conclusive" (Belgium 29 Nov.  2011,  5).
      The report also notes that although  some  organizations  have  issued
      fake attestation letters, [translation] "it does  not  mean  that  all
      attestation  letters  issued  by  those  organizations  contain  false
      information" (ibid.)."


Discussion

52. The evidence before us is that Albania had a problem  with  blood  feuds
   before the Communist era, which ended after 47 years with the election of
   the Democratic Party's President Sali Berisha in 1992.  Albania is not  a
   large country.  It has a population of 3.2 million, slightly over a third
   of the population of London (about 8.2 million)

53. There  is  a  dichotomy  between  the  evidence  of  the  reconciliation
   organisations, and the CNR in particular, that there are a  large  number
   of active feuds, and many self-confined families and children,  and  that
   of the Albanian government and Professor  Alston,  that  the  problem  is
   small and diminishing.  The evidence of Dr  Schwandner-Sievers  was  that
   the numbers were not particularly large, though perhaps not as  small  as
   Professor Alston and the Albanian government considered them to be.

54. We have considered what weight we should give to the  contrary  position
   of Mr Marku on behalf of the CNR.   We were very concerned by a number of
   aspects of his oral evidence.  In particular, his evidence that he  never
   took notes, followed by the production of notes  (untranslated)  on  this
   feud; his assertion that he worked in chaos, contrasted with his evidence
   to the Canadian IRB that he had a file on every blood feud and meticulous
   documentation;  his inability to remember whether the appellant's  family
   had approached him in 2007, 2008,  or  2010;  the  mismatch  between  the
   letter about the appellant's circumstances and the account the  appellant
   himself gave; and the international concerns, recorded  by  the  Canadian
   IRB, and supported by the evidence of Dr Schwandner-Sievers, that the CNR
   letters were for sale, whether or not a feud existed, did not enhance his
   credibility.  In certain areas of his evidence, Mr Marku had  a  prepared
   answer from which he did not deviate, even if it had no relevance to  the
   questions asked by Counsel or the Tribunal, and despite being  warned  of
   our concern and asked to address the question.  Overall, by  the  end  of
   the hearing, we had formed a strongly negative view of the credibility of
   his evidence and the value of any attestation letters from the CNR.

55. We reject the evidence of the CNR and  Mr  Marku  that  the  blood  feud
   problem is large and growing; international press reports before  us  are
   all traceable to his evidence and are tainted by its  unreliability.   We
   noted that Mr Marku admitted that at least  some  CNR  letters  had  been
   forged by Mr Loci, and that the organisation  would  accept  benefits  in
   kind such as cars, as part of the mediation process.   We  consider  that
   the organisation and Mr Marku are wholly unreliable and  that  no  weight
   can be placed on the attestation letters they produce.  We also reject Mr
   Marku's  evidence  that  the  CNR  is  the  only  body  which  can  issue
   attestation letters:  we note the position of  the  Albanian  authorities
   that attestation is a matter for the prosecutors and the courts.

56. On the totality of the evidence before us, we consider that  Mr  Marku's
   claimed expertise is so damaged that an attestation letter from the  CNR,
   or  indeed  from  any  of   the   mediation   organisations   now   under
   investigation, adds no weight whatsoever to an  otherwise  unsatisfactory
   account of an alleged blood feud.  We do not go so far as saying that  an
   attestation letter ought to  be  regarded  as  detracting  from  such  an
   account, although such a conclusion may be permissible on the  individual
   facts of a particular case.  But, as a general proposition,  we  consider
   that where an appellant relies on a CNR or other NGO  attestation  letter
   to prove the existence of a blood feud from which he would be at risk  on
   return, that is unlikely to be determinative of the appeal in his favour.
   By contrast, documents found genuinely to  originate  from  the  Albanian
   courts, police or prosecution service  may  assist  in  establishing  the
   existence of a blood feud at  the  date  of  the  document  relied  upon.
   However, given the evidence regarding corruption  in  Albania,  the  fact
   that such a document comes from its asserted source will not  necessarily
   be probative of the reliability of the information contained within  that
   document.  Judicial  fact-finders  may,  therefore  need  to  assess  its
   reliability on Tanveer Ahmed principles.

57. In the light of the problems with corruption in the Albanian press,  and
   the  influence  and  involvement  which  Mr  Marku  has  in  all  of  the
   international press reports before us, we also do  not  consider  that  a
   press report concerning a death or feud will normally add much weight  to
   an appellant's  account  of  a  blood  feud.   In  some  cases,  however,
   consistent local or national press reports published promptly  after  the
   events relied upon may add weight to an oral account provided  that  they
   are factual.  The involvement of Mr Marku or the CNR  in  a  national  or
   international  press  report  will  affect  its  weight  because  of  the
   intensely problematic nature of his  evidence.   Albanian  press  reports
   will carry limited, if any, weight because the evidence is  that  stories
   can be freely inserted in both the national and local press,  whether  or
   not there is any substance to them.

58. We accept that there remain a number of active blood feuds  in  Albania,
   but we prefer the evidence of Professor Alston  that  they  are  few  and
   declining.  The reliable evidence before us supports a finding that there
   are a small number of deaths annually arising from ongoing feuds and that
   a small number  of  adults  and  children  are  in  self-confinement  for
   protection.   The  Albanian  government  has  residential  programmes  to
   educate self-confined children, but very few  children  are  involved  in
   them and those who are do not always take up the option  of  living  away
   from home in residential units for this purpose.

59. The existence of a 'modern blood feud' is  not  established:  we  accept
   and prefer the evidence of Dr Schwandner-Sievers that  true  Kanun  blood
   feuds have always allowed for the possibility of pre-emptive killing by a
   dominant clan.

Family as particular social group

60.  In  the  respondent's  December  2010  submissions,  she  argued   that
   following the decision of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in SB,  the
   Upper Tribunal should find that members of families or clans involved  in
   blood feuds or vendettas were not capable of  constituting  a  particular
   social group.

61. That position is inconsistent with the judgment of the  House  of  Lords
   in 2006 in Secretary of State for the Home  Department  v.  K,  Fornah  v
   Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 46 (K and Fornah),
   in  which  the  respondent  accepted  that  a  family  can  constitute  a
   particular social group for the purposes of Article  1A  of  the  Refugee
   Convention.  At paragraph 45 in the opinion of Lord Hope of Craighead  in
   K and Fornah, he said this:

        "45.      It is universally accepted that the family is a  socially
           cognisable group  in  society:  UNHCR position  on  claims  for
           refugee status under the 1951 Convention relating to the  Status
           of  Refugees  based  on  a  fear  of  persecution  due   to   an
           individual's membership of a family or clan engaged in  a  blood
           feud,  17  March  2006,  p  5.  Article  23(1)   of   the   1966
           International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that
           the family "is the natural and fundamental group unit of society
           and is entitled to protection by society  and  the  State."  The
           ties that bind members of a family together, whether by blood or
           by marriage, define the group. It is  those  ties  that  set  it
           apart from the rest of society. Persecution of a  person  simply
           because he is a member of the same family as someone else is  as
           arbitrary and capricious, and just as pernicious, as persecution
           for reasons of race or religion. As a social  group  the  family
           falls naturally into the category of cases to which the  Refugee
           Convention extends its protection."

62. It is settled therefore, that members of families or clans  are  capable
   of constituting a particular social group and that the Refugee Convention
   would be engaged where there existed a reasonable  degree  of  likelihood
   that members of a particular family would be at risk of serious  harm  on
   return, subject of course to whether internal relocation  was  available,
   or whether the state provided sufficient protection against such risk.

63. The same level of risk would also be capable of engaging Articles 2  and
   3 ECHR, depending on the level of certainty that the aggressor clan would
   kill the appellant, if the appellant were the next in line  for  killing.



64. However, in the blood feud cases which the Tribunal  sees,  very  often,
   as here, the claimed risk is of pressure to commit the next murder.   The
   appellant in such a case can choose not to commit another murder.  In AMM
   and others (conflict; humanitarian crisis;  returnees;  FGM)  Somalia  CG
   [2011] UKUT 445 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal considered whether a woman who,
   while opposed to female genital mutilation, might eventually give  in  to
   extreme societal pressure, lack of  clan  protection,  and  the  risk  of
   ruining their daughters' marriage prospects, and facilitate or carry  out
   circumcision, could come within the ambit of the Refugee Convention.

65. The Tribunal in AMM  accepted  that  in  the  light  of  the  particular
   circumstances in Somalia, access to Refugee Convention protection in such
   circumstances might be possible, but that:

      "562.   As  we  stated  in  Part  H,  we   do   not   consider   that,
      notwithstanding its status  as  a  "living  instrument",  the  Refugee
      Convention can be construed  as  affording  refugee  protection  to  a
      person who is in favour of inflicting harm on another, whether or  not
      the  societal  and  religious  background  of  that  person  might  be
      responsible for  her  having  that  wish,  and  whether  the  harm  is
      inflicted by that person or by someone else, with her approval.  ...


      591.  A person  is  not  entitled  to  protection  under  the  Refugee
      Convention, the Qualification Directive or Article 3 of the  ECHR,  on
      the basis of a risk of harm to another person, if that harm  would  be
      willingly inflicted by the person seeking such protection  (paragraphs
      238 - 240 and 561-567)."

66. The societal consequences of failure to murder in Albanian  society  are
   not on  all  fours  with  failure  by  a  mother  to  facilitate  genital
   mutilation of a female child in the desperate instability  of  a  failing
   state such as Somalia was, when assessed in AMM.  The evidence before  us
   is that murder is unlawful in Albania, that  blood  feud  killings  carry
   long prison sentences, and that the local pressures are at the  level  of
   social disapproval and are not universal.  We therefore adopt and rely on
   the general position taken by the Tribunal in AMM that the  intention  to
   inflict harm on return does  not  entitle  an  individual  to  access  to
   international protection  under  the  Refugee  Convention,  Qualification
   Directive, or Article 3 ECHR.

The Australian jurisprudence

67. The Australian case law on particular social  group  is  affected  by  a
   statutory definition of particular social group in  section  91S  of  the
   Migration Act 1958 (as amended):

      "Membership of a particular social group
      s.91S For the  purposes  of  the  application  of  this  Act  and  the
      regulations to a particular person (the first person), in determining
      whether the first person has a well-founded fear of  being  persecuted
      for the reason  of membership of  a  particular  social  group  that
      consists of the first person's family:

      (a)  disregard any fear of persecution, or any persecution,  that  any
      other member or former member (whether alive or dead) of the family
      has ever experienced, where the reason for the fear or persecution  is
      not a reason mentioned in Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as
      amended by the Refugees Protocol; and

      (b)  disregard any fear of persecution, or any persecution, that:

      (i)  the first person has ever experienced; or

      (ii)  any other member or former member (whether alive or dead) of the
      family has ever experienced;

      where it is reasonable to conclude that the fear or persecution  would
      not exist if it were assumed that the fear or persecution mentioned in
      paragraph (a) had never existed."


68. That definition appears to us to be circular, and it is  not  surprising
   that the Australian authorities, while acknowledging the  United  Kingdom
   approach, arrive at a different position in relation to blood  feuds  and
   the existence of the family as a particular social group.  The Australian
   authorities to which we were referred were a decision of the  High  Court
   of Australia in STCB v Minister for  Immigration  and  Multicultural  and
   Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61; (2006) 231 ALR 556; (2006) 81 ALJR  485
   which applies s.91S, and another,  by  the  Refugee  Review  Tribunal  of
   Australia in 0908334 [2010] RRTA, applying STCB.  Both are  unhelpful  to
   us by reason of the different statutory definition  which  underlies  the
   analysis and we decline to adopt the approach there taken.

Internal relocation

69. If there is a risk of persecution or  serious  harm  on  the  particular
   facts of an appellant's appeal, the next  question  is  whether  internal
   relocation is available affording effective protection, including whether
   it would be unreasonable to expect the appellant to avail himself of that
   protection.  We remind ourselves how small the population of Albania  is,
   just over 3 million with a  land  mass  of  about  10,000  square  miles,
   roughly 15  times  the  size  of  London,  much  of  it  mountains.   The
   respondent's current guidance on internal relocation in  Albania  is  set
   out in her May 2012 Operational Guidance Note as follows:

      "2.4.2  Very careful consideration must be given to  whether  internal
        relocation would be an effective way to avoid a real risk  of  ill-
        treatment/persecution at the hands of, tolerated by,  or  with  the
        connivance of, state agents. If an applicant who faces a real  risk
        of ill-treatment/persecution in their home area would  be  able  to
        relocate to a part of the country where they would not be  at  real
        risk, whether from state or non-state actors, and it would  not  be
        unduly harsh to expect them to do so, then asylum  or  humanitarian
        protection should be refused.

      2.4.3 Albania covers a total area of 28,748 sq km and has an estimated
        population of 3,002,859.  Tiran� (Tirana) is the capital and  other
        principal cities are  Kor��  (Koritsa),  Durr�s  (Durazzo),  Berat,
        Elbasan,  Lushnj�,  Shkod�r  (Scutari),  Kavaj�,  Vlor�  (Vlon�  or
        Valona), Pogradec and Fier.

      2.4.4 The constitution and law provide for freedom of movement  within
        the country, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation  and  the
        government generally respected these rights in practice.   Internal
        migrants must  transfer  their  civil  registration  to  their  new
        community of residence to  receive  government  services  and  must
        prove they are legally  domiciled  through  property  ownership,  a
        property rental agreement, or utility bills. Many persons could not
        provide  this  proof  and  therefore  lacked  access  to  essential
        services.  Other  citizens  lacked  formal  registration   in   the
        communities in which they resided,  particularly  Roma  and  Balkan
        Egyptians. The law did not prohibit their registration but  it  was
        often difficult in practice to complete. The law  prohibits  forced
        exile and the government did not employ it.

      2.4.5 It may be practical for applicants in some  categories  who  may
        have a well-founded fear of persecution in one area to relocate  to
        other parts of Albania where they would not  have  a  well  founded
        fear and, taking into  account  their  personal  circumstances,  it
        would not be unduly harsh to expect them to do so.
                                                           [Emphasis added]"

70. Internal relocation will be  effective  to  protect  an  appellant  only
   where the risk does not extend beyond the appellant's local area  and  he
   is unlikely to be traced in the rest of Albania by the aggressor clan.  A
   crucial factor in establishing whether  internal  relocation  is  a  real
   possibility is the geographical and  political  reach  of  the  aggressor
   clan:  where that  clan  has  government  connections,  locally  or  more
   widely, the requirement to transfer civil registration to a new area,  as
   set out at 2.4.4 above,  would  appear  to  obviate  the  possibility  of
   'disappearing' in another part of the country, and  would  be  likely  to
   drive the male members of a victim clan to self-confinement in  the  home
   area as an alternative.  Whether internal relocation is reasonable in any
   particular appeal will always be a question of fact for the  fact-finding
   Tribunal.

Self-confinement

71. The conditions of self-confinement, where it is required, are  that  the
   male members of the  threatened  clan  must  remain  within  their  homes
   permanently, unless a besa is given for a particular  event,  such  as  a
   family funeral or wedding, or the feud is reconciled.  That is a position
   analogous to  the  'living  discreetly'  requirement  considered  by  the
   Supreme Court in HJ (Iran) and HT (Cameroon) v Secretary of State for the
   Home Department [2010] UKSC 31.  The Supreme Court  in  that  case  found
   that, where a material reason for the claimant living discreetly (in this
   case in self-confinement) on return would be a fear  of  the  persecution
   which would follow if he or she were to live openly,  then  international
   protection  should  be  available.   (Our  interpolations  are  given  in
   italics):

       "...other things being equal, his  application  should  be  accepted.
      Such a person has a well-founded fear of persecution.  To  reject  his
      application on the ground that  he  could  avoid  the  persecution  by
      living discreetly [in self-confinement] would be to  defeat  the  very
      right which the Convention exists to  protect  -  his  right  to  live
      freely and openly  as  a  [member  of  his  family]  without  fear  of
      persecution. By admitting him to  asylum  and  allowing  him  to  live
      freely and openly  as  a  [member  of  his  family]  without  fear  of
      persecution, the  receiving  state  gives  effect  to  that  right  by
      affording  the  applicant  a  surrogate  for   the   protection   from
      persecution which his country  of  nationality  should  have  afforded
      him."

72. It follows that where there is a genuine, active blood feud whose  reach
   is so wide as to preclude any internal relocation option, such that self-
   confinement is the only protection against the risk  of  killing  by  the
   opposing clan, an appellant's claim will normally succeed.

Country guidance

73. In TB, the Immigration Appeal Tribunal set out a list of factors  to  be
   considered in determining whether there was an active  blood  feud  which
   constituted a risk for a particular appellant:

     "36.  ... The] following matters will be relevant in  determining  the
     nature of the risk on return:

           (a)   whether the dispute can be characterised as a 'blood feud'
                 at all;

           (b)   even if it can,  the  extent  to  which  its  origins  and
                 development (if any) are to be regarded by Albanian society
                 as falling within the classic principles of the Kanun;

           (c)   the history of the feud, including the  notoriety  of  the
                 original killings and numbers killed;

           (d)   the past and likely future  attitude  of  the  police  and
                 other authorities towards the feud;

           (e)   the degree of  commitment  shown  by  the  aggressor  clan
                 towards prosecuting the feud;

           (f)   the time that has elapsed since the last killing;

           (g)   the ability of the aggressor clan to  locate  the  alleged
                 potential victim anywhere in Albania;

           (h)   that person's profile as a potential target for the  blood
                 feud; and

           (i)    the  prospects  for  eliminating  the  feud,  whether  by
                 recourse  to  the  payment  of  money,   a   reconciliation
                 organisation or otherwise.

      37.   ...The more one moves away from the paradigm situation, the more
           difficult it will become for a person to rely upon  so  much  of
           the current objective evidence  as  indicates  an  inability  or
           unwillingness on the part of the police and other authorities to
           take effective action to protect the possible victim."

74. In the light of the evidence before  the  Tribunal  now,  the  following
   guidance replaces that given in TB:

     a) While there remain a number of active blood feuds in Albania,  they
        are few and declining.  There are a small number of deaths annually
        arising from those feuds and a small number of adults and  children
        living in self-confinement for protection.   Government  programmes
        to educate self-confined children exist but very few  children  are
        involved in them.

     b) The existence of a 'modern blood feud' is  not  established:  Kanun
        blood feuds have always allowed for the possibility of  pre-emptive
        killing by a dominant clan.

     c) The Albanian state has taken steps to improve state protection, but
        in areas where Kanun law  predominates  (particularly  in  northern
        Albania) those steps do not yet provide sufficiency  of  protection
        from Kanun-related  blood-taking  if  an  active  feud  exists  and
        affects the individual claimant.  Internal relocation to an area of
        Albania  less  dependent  on  the  Kanun  may  provide   sufficient
        protection, depending on the reach, influence,  and  commitment  to
        prosecution of the feud by the aggressor clan.

     d)   International   protection   under   the   Refugee    Convention,
        Qualification Directive or Articles 2 and 3 ECHR is  not  available
        to an appellant who is willing and  intends  to  commit  a  revenge
        killing on return to his country of origin, by  reference  to  that
        intention.

     e) Where there is an active feud affecting  an  individual  and  self-
        confinement is the only option, that person will  normally  qualify
        for Refugee status.

     f) In determining whether an  active  blood  feud  exists,  the  fact-
        finding Tribunal should consider:

           (i)   the history of the alleged feud, including  the  notoriety
                 of the original  killings,  the  numbers  killed,  and  the
                 degree of commitment  by  the  aggressor  clan  toward  the
                 prosecution of the feud;

           (ii)   the  length  of  time  since  the  last  death  and   the
                 relationship of the last person killed to the appellant;

              v) the ability of members of the aggressor clan to locate  the
                 appellant if returned to another part of Albania; and

             vi) the past and likely future attitude of the police and other
                 authorities towards the feud  and  the  protection  of  the
                 family of the person claiming to be at risk, including  any
                 past  attempts  to  seek  prosecution  of  members  of  the
                 aggressor clan, or to seek  protection  from  the  Albanian
                 authorities.

     g) In order to establish that there is an active blood feud  affecting
        him personally, an appellant must produce  satisfactory  individual
        evidence of its existence in relation to him.  In  particular,  the
        appellant must establish:

              i) his profile as a potential target of  the  feud  identified
                 and which family carried out the most recent killing; and

             ii) whether the appellant has been, or  other  members  of  his
                 family have been, or  are  currently,  in  self-confinement
                 within Albania.

     h) Attestation letters from  Albanian  non-governmental  organisations
        should not in general be  regarded  as  reliable  evidence  of  the
        existence of a feud.

     i)  Documents  originating  from  the  Albanian  courts,   police   or
        prosecution service, if genuine, may  assist  in  establishing  the
        existence of a blood feud at the date of the document relied  upon,
        subject to the test of reliability set out  in  A  v  Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department (Pakistan) [2002] UKIAT 00439, [2002]
        Imm A R 318 (Tanveer Ahmed).

     j) Unless factual, prompt and consistent, Albanian press reports  will
        add little or no evidential weight in considering  whether  a  feud
        exists.

     k) Whether the feud continues and what the attitude of  the  aggressor
        clan to its pursuit may be will remain  questions  of  fact  to  be
        determined by the fact-finding Tribunal.

     l) This guidance replaces that contained in TB (Blood feuds,  Relevant
        Risk Factors) Albania CG [2004] UKIAT 000158.


The present appellant

75. The  difficulties  with  the  appellant's  evidence  have  already  been
   mentioned.  Others are set out in the account of his evidence at Appendix
   B.  The modifications made in the appellant's  account  as  it  developed
   were self-serving and  contradictory.   He  endeavoured  to  explain  the
   problem of his contact with sheep, first by saying that  the  sheep  were
   kept indoors, but when that appeared to cause difficulties, the appellant
   stated that his mother sold the family animals when he was 15  years  old
   and went into self-confinement in 2007 after his father died.  That is  a
   different account from that given to his medical  adviser  who  was  told
   that the appellant began shepherding the family flock from the age of  15
   (i.e. in  2007)  until  he  left  Albania.   There  were  numerous  other
   discrepancies which are set out at Appendix B, concerning the threats  to
   the appellant (variously stated to have taken place in a car  or  in  the
   corner of a caf�) and the way in which the documents he produced in  this
   appeal were obtained and reached him.

76. We also noted that the appellant and his mother,  on  his  own  account,
   had sought the protection of the Albanian authorities after his  father's
   death.  They attended the police station on  two  occasions  to  complain
   about his father's death.  The response was that his father was  a  known
   drug dealer who had drawn a gun after  an  altercation  with  the  police
   officer.  The incident had been investigated and they were told  that  no
   prosecution would be undertaken as the officer had  been  acting  in  the
   course of his duties.

77. The appellant's second cousin, Ms EN, gave evidence.  She has not  lived
   in Albania since 2003 and had no direct knowledge  of  the  circumstances
   underlying this appeal. She knew the family well but lived in a different
   village.  Her account did not provide  any  material  assistance  to  the
   unsatisfactory account given by the appellant.

78. We find that the evidence set out in Appendices A-D  is  not  sufficient
   to establish that a blood feud exists affecting  the  present  appellant.
   There has been only one  death,  that  of  the  appellant's  father;  his
   paternal uncles have suffered no retribution; there is no  evidence  that
   they are in self-confinement; and there is no reliable  evidence  of  any
   pursuit of the appellant.

79. When assessing the credibility of the appellant's account,  we  bore  in
   mind that the index events took place when he was younger, and  that  his
   knowledge of events and his recollection may well have been  affected  by
   that.  However, we considered that the appellant  had  a  propensity  for
   altering his account in any way which might  resolve  difficulties  which
   had occurred in his previous accounts, such that  no  reliance  could  be
   placed on his account of the  index  events.  The  discrepancies  in  his
   evidence were not such as to be connected with his young age at the  time
   of the index events.  We considered them to be self-serving  fabrications
   to enable him to remain in the United Kingdom.

80. There remained, however, the  documents  discovered  by  Dr  Schwandner-
   Sievers during her research, and the attestation certificate by Mr  Marku
   from the CNR.  In the light of our assessment of the weight which can  be
   given to Mr Marku's  blood  feud  attestation  letters,  the  letter  now
   produced adds nothing to the appellant's account.

81. The newspaper evidence discovered  by  Dr  Schwandner-Sievers,  and  the
   prosecutor's report, both confirm the death of a man bearing the name  of
   the appellant's father, shot by a police officer in 2007.  We accept that
   the newspaper reports before us are from the publications named and  that
   they are evidence that  this  appellant's  father  was  shot  dead  by  a
   policeman in 2007.  The reports say that the appellant's father went home
   to get his pistol and shot first.  The account given was not  that  there
   was a feud between the families, rather, that there was  a  single  'road
   rage' shooting, following an unspecified recent personal history  between
   the appellant's father and the policeman who shot him.   The  appellant's
   family have chosen not to retaliate,  his  uncles  distancing  themselves
   from the family, and the appellant travelling abroad.   The  prosecutor's
   report indicates that the policeman was not charged with any offence  and
   there have been no subsequent killings by either clan.

Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.  We set aside the decision.

We re-make the decision by  dismissing  this  appeal  on  asylum  and  human
rights grounds.  The appellant is not entitled to the grant of  humanitarian
protection.

Judith Gleeson

                                 Appendix B

Evidence of appellant and his witnesses

1. The appellant was born on 16 September 1991, a year  after  the  fall  of
   communism in Albania.  His father joined  the  Albanian  Socialist  Party
   (ASP) in 1997, and, from about 13 years  old  (in  or  about  2004),  the
   appellant attended ASP meetings with his father.   In late  2005,  AG,  a
   member of the aggressor clan threatened the appellant's  father,  telling
   him to stop his ASP activities.  There was an altercation,  during  which
   the  father's  colleagues  intervened,  and  AG   left.    Although   the
   appellant's family reported the incident to  the  police,  they  took  no
   action.   AG's  brother  BG  was  a  high-ranking  police  officer.   The
   appellant's initial claim was that he was at risk for political  reasons,
   as a member of his father's family.  There was no mention of blood  feud,
   either modern or historic.

2. In April 2007, the police officer, BG, stopped the  appellant's  father's
   car:  his father was shot  and  killed.   The  appellant's  family  again
   reported the matter to the police.  The  appellant,  now  16  years  old,
   accompanied his widowed mother to the police station.   This  time,  they
   were told after a few days that his father was a drug dealer and had been
   killed for failure to stop at the  request  of  a  police  officer.   The
   police would not take any further action.  Six  weeks  later,  while  the
   appellant was out shopping, BG approached him, saying that he would  kill
   the appellant because the appellant had registered  a  complaint  against
   him.

3. The appellant went home and, he  says,  into  self-confinement.   A  year
   later he left Albania, in July 2008.  Nothing had  happened  in  between.
   He travelled openly on his own passport, first  to  Kosovo.   His  mother
   accompanied him on that leg of the journey, and then returned to her home
   area.  The appellant travelled on to Montenegro, then to France, where he
   was arrested and sent back to Italy.   He  was  released  after  a  short
   period, tried again to enter France with the  same  result,  but  on  the
   third attempt he reached  France  and  entered  the  United  Kingdom  via
   Calais, after spending six months in a camp outside Calais.

4. The appellant claimed to have telephoned his family  from  the  camp  and
   been told that the police officer, BG, had arranged for someone  to  kill
   him in France.  He thought that there were Albanians in the camp who  had
   recognised him and he was afraid.  In January 2009 he entered the  United
   Kingdom clandestinely in a lorry, and claimed asylum two  days  after  he
   arrived.  Once here, he made contact with his cousin, Mrs EN and  he  has
   been living with her family since then.

Evidence at the AIT hearing

5. The appellant gave oral evidence at the AIT hearing,  and  produced  four
   documents at that hearing which had not previously been considered:   his
   birth certificate; his father's death certificate  giving  the  cause  of
   death as 'killing by firearm'; a letter from the  village  chief  in  the
   appellant's home village, stating that his father was involved in a blood
   feud and the appellant also, because 'they' had killed his father; and  a
   certificate setting out the members of the appellant's family  group.  He
   produced three  newspaper  reports,  to  which  we  will  return,  giving
   contemporaneous accounts of his father's death.

6. All of these documents had been  recently  obtained  by  the  appellant's
   mother, who gave them to someone who took them to France, to give to  the
   appellant in the Calais camp from which he was trying to reach the United
   Kingdom.   The appellant's evidence was that these documents  had  to  be
   obtained from various different public  offices  and  courts,  which  his
   mother attended, in order to obtain the documents and send them  to  him.
   The appellant made no use of the documents while in France. When asked to
   explain why he  had  not  gone  to  the  French  authorities  with  these
   documents to claim asylum, he replied that he did not have an interpreter
   and could not speak French; also, he was in danger, as the aggressor clan
   had discovered where he was.   His  family  wanted  justice  against  the
   policeman who killed his father, which was why he was still at risk.

7. The appellant said he had not been approached at  his  father's  funeral,
   which took place the day after his father  died.  He  was  surrounded  by
   cousins and family members.  He had  not  mentioned  blood  feud  in  his
   initial statement, or at his asylum interview, although he was  aware  of
   the expression.  The appellant said  he  knew  that  the  source  of  the
   argument between  his  father  and  the  policeman  who  killed  him  was
   political.

Oral evidence

8. The appellant adopted his asylum interview and his February 2009  witness
   statement, with some amendments.  He confirmed that the witness statement
   had been read back to him in Albanian.  He wished  to  amend  the  stated
   ages for his sisters:  the elder one was 15, not 11, and the younger  one
   was 11 or thereabouts.  He  had  also  given  a  screening  interview  on
   arrival.

9. The appellant confirmed his account of his father's death, in  2007  when
   he was only 15. He had helped his mother attend the  police  station  but
   the police declined to help them, telling them  that  his  father  was  a
   known drug dealer.   The appellant had undergone a lot of stress.  He did
   go out occasionally for three or four months after  his  father's  death.
   However, on one occasion, when the appellant was out shopping in the town
   of Krum, he stated that BG, the police officer, had forced him into a van
   (his witness statement said into 'a corner') and told the  appellant  not
   to pursue the matter further, or he would kill him as he had  killed  his
   father. The appellant could not explain why, in his witness statement, he
   said the threat was made in a corner, and now he was saying  it  happened
   in a van.  Nor could the appellant explain why BG did  not  kill  him  or
   harm him at the time; perhaps, he thought, at  15  he  was  not  yet  old
   enough.

10. After that event, his mother did not allow him to leave the  house,  and
   the appellant was too afraid to do so.  He only ever went as far  as  the
   courtyard of the family home after that.   His  paternal  uncle  and  his
   cousin GH distanced themselves from the situation and  refused  to  help.
   The appellant has a disease caught from working with sheep.  The  medical
   evidence indicated that he had told his consultant that  he  worked  with
   sheep in the 18 months before coming to the United Kingdom.   When  asked
   how that was possible, he first said that the sheep were kept inside  the
   family home, and then that they were kept indoors, in a sheep house  near
   the family home.   He  had  attended  to  them  there  before  his  self-
   confinement in June 2007.  He had also ceased schooling after 8 years and
   been unable to do any higher education:  he  was  too  afraid  to  go  to
   school.

11. The appellant did not begin trying to leave Albania until July 2009  but
   claimed to have been self-confined during that period, spending  most  of
   his time at home.  He confirmed  that  he  had  travelled  on  a  genuine
   Albanian passport, obtained in June 2007 by his maternal uncle, using the
   appellant's genuine birth certificate and some passport photographs which
   he possessed because he had needed to have  some  taken  for  his  school
   graduation.  The appellant's mother had travelled  with  him  as  far  as
   Montenegro.  The agent took him on to Italy.  He  did  not  claim  asylum
   there, because he was unable to speak the language.

12. The appellant made three  attempts  to  reach  the  United  Kingdom  via
   France, but did not seek asylum in France, although he lived for  a  time
   with other Albanians in France.  He was afraid to say anything about  his
   situation during that time.  He thought  they  were  probably  all  in  a
   similar situation to his own.  The appellant did have  a  contact  number
   for his mother in Albania but did not use it often because he  could  not
   afford to do so.  His mother did not tell him anything,  not  wanting  to
   upset him.  His brother, who had now  finished  school,  was  also  self-
   confined.  He had used an Albanian mobile with a French SIM card while in
   France, and his mother had contacted him on that number to  say  that  he
   was at risk in France.  In England, the appellant  had  bought  a  United
   Kingdom mobile phone to contact his mother. He had last contacted her two
   months before the  Upper Tribunal hearing.

13. In relation to the letters and  documents  about  the  blood  feud,  the
   appellant said he had brought them with him to the  United  Kingdom.   He
   had them sent to him in France but did not consider taking  them  to  the
   French authorities when he  received  them.   The  reason  was  that  the
   appellant's mother had told him that BG knew where he was in  France  and
   was going  to  send  people  there  to  kill  him.    This  part  of  the
   appellant's evidence required several repetitions of  the  question.  His
   second, inconsistent, response was that when the French  police  arrested
   him, they did not ask him whether he was a refugee but simply took him to
   the camp.  There were many Albanians in the camp, some of whom knew BG as
   well as the appellant.  There were also many Albanians in London, but  he
   personally only knew his cousin and her husband.  Asked what  BG  had  to
   fear from the appellant, who could not harm  him  while  in  France,  the
   appellant said that as a policeman, BG still feared the case which he and
   his mother had pursued regarding his father's death.  He agreed  that  he
   had never threatened BG and that the authorities in Albania had shown  no
   interest in pursuing BG.

14. The CNR attestation letter had been received by his  present  solicitors
   in London on 3 December 2010.  The CNR had been involved for  'a  while',
   since shortly after his father died, but had  been  unable  to  make  any
   progress in reconciling the feud.   His maternal uncle was  the  one  who
   had taken the case to the CNR and who had requested the  document  to  be
   prepared, after the appellant's solicitor asked for a document to support
   the blood feud  claim,  about  three  weeks  before  the  Upper  Tribunal
   hearing.  The appellant  had  not  sought  to  produce  such  a  document
   himself, as he had not known that was possible, but his uncle  had  asked
   for a fax number and the CNR had  faxed  the  document  through  directly
   through to the appellant's representatives.  His uncle had  the  original
   document, which was still in Albania.  The same uncle  had  provided  the
   other documents while the appellant was in France. When asked why in  his
   screening interview, asylum interview and witness statement  he  did  not
   mention the existence of a blood  feud,  the  appellant  stated  that  he
   thought it was 'understood' that in making reference to politics he meant
   gjakmarrja.

15. The appellant said that his mother was still living in the family  home,
   with  his  younger  brother  and  his  two  sisters.   Her  brother,  the
   appellant's maternal uncle, lived separately with his two  sons  and  two
   daughters.   His father still had living siblings, two brothers  and  two
   sisters, but they had not lived with the appellant's family  for  fifteen
   years.   His paternal uncles lived, respectively, an hour,  and  half  an
   hour away by car.  His father's brothers had 5 daughters and  three  sons
   between them; his sisters had three  daughters  and  one  son.   All  the
   children were still under 12 years old.  No threats had been made to  his
   paternal uncles and they had not threatened BG.   He did not know why his
   father's brothers had not sought revenge for his death.  The  appellant's
   understanding now was that this was an old feud, but  that  when  he  was
   younger, the adults in his life had not told him about it, even  when  he
   spent a year self-confined in the family home.

16. In cross-examination, the appellant was asked to clarify how his  mother
   had been able to obtain the documents required without leaving the house.
    He said the registry office in his village was very close to their home,
   just a minute's walk away. The document from the local  elders  (what  Mr
   Marku called the 'missionaries') was obtained from the same  office.   He
   had  received  these  documents  in  France  at  the  end  of  2008,   or
   thereabouts, when he had been there for six months.  His mother had  been
   aware of the threats in August 2008, and  the  document  from  the  local
   elders had been sought at that time.  'They' (his mother and  uncle)  had
   just sent it to him because he might need it, although the  threats  were
   not communicated to the appellant until the following year, prompting his
   onward travel to the United Kingdom.  He had  been  required  to  make  a
   personal request for the CNR document: that was the only way  of  getting
   it.

17. It was the appellant's cousin who had told him of  his  father's  death.
   The cousin was with his father when it happened.  He confirmed that  when
   they reported the death to the police station in Krum, about 40  minutes'
   drive from his family home, the police refused to act on the  basis  that
   they considered the appellant's father to be a drug dealer.  As the  Krum
   police refused to help, the appellant also reported it  in  Kuk�s.   Both
   occasions were shortly after the death, about two or three  weeks  later.
   When they got no satisfaction, the appellant reported the death  to  more
   senior police.

18. The appellant was asked why he now  stated  that  his  father  had  been
   threatened in 2005 and killed in 2007, when previously  his  account  was
   simply that his father was killed in 2007.  When amending his account and
   the witness statement he had prepared in February 2010, he had  not  also
   amended that part of the account, nor  was  it  one  of  the  matters  he
   corrected at the beginning of his oral evidence to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
   The discrepancy between his witness statement, when he  said  the  threat
   from BG occurred in a corner of a caf�, and his present evidence, that it
   had taken place in a van, was put to the appellant.

19. In answer to questions from the Tribunal, the appellant stated that  his
   family had cows and sheep at the  time  but  had  stopped  keeping  them,
   because they needed to be let out and taken to the fields.  They only had
   a dog now.  They had sold the sheep after only  a  short  time,  about  a
   month, after keeping them indoors for that period.  A man came  and  took
   them away.  The cows had been sold around, or just before, the  death  of
   his father. The family owned the house and received some  help  from  the
   local authority now  they  could  no  longer  farm.   The  whole  of  the
   appellant's extended family had attended his father's  funeral.   BG  had
   not threatened the appellant's  paternal  uncles  because  they  had  not
   threatened him; the appellant was nevertheless sure that he  remained  in
   personal danger, because he had tried to take BG to court.  Dealing  with
   the threat incident,  the  appellant  was  asked  why  it  was  worth  BG
   threatening to kill him, if he had already been to the police in at least
   two districts, but he was unable to answer that question.  The  appellant
   corrected his account of when he had last spoken to his mother, which  he
   now said was two to three weeks before the hearing,  to  obtain  the  CNR
   attestation letter, not two months earlier as he had originally told  us.



20. In re-examination, the appellant stated that he had trouble with  dates.
    When it was put to him that there were many discrepancies in his account
   and that the respondent would say that he was lying,  there  was  a  very
   long pause.  The appellant then said again that he  had  difficulty  with
   dates.  He confirmed that his mother was also living in  self-confinement
   in Albania, despite her sex.  His evidence was that no family  member  of
   the victim clan was entirely safe: the other family  could  come  to  the
   house to kill, but in this case, they  had  not  done  so.   It  was  his
   solicitors' interpreter who had prepared a translation of  the  documents
   received in France.


Mrs EN

21. The Tribunal heard  evidence  from  Mrs  EN,  the  appellant's  paternal
   cousin, with whom he lives in the  United  Kingdom,  and  who  had  given
   evidence at the last hearing.   At the First-tier Tribunal  hearing,  Mrs
   EN provided a witness statement and gave oral evidence.  In  her  witness
   statement, she said the appellant was her  second  cousin:   they  shared
   great-grandparents, and their paternal grandmother and  grandfather  were
   brother and sister. Their home villages were about half an hour apart  in
   Albania and she knew his family well.  She came to the United Kingdom  in
   2003, long before the events in the appellant's account.

22. Mrs EN is not from the same village and has no direct knowledge  of  the
   feud, though she stated that Clan G had a reputation.  She could not help
   on the origin of the documents the appellant said he received in  France;
   she was aware of threats in 2008, because  when  she  returned  to  visit
   Albania, she heard about them there from friends and relatives,  but  she
   had been unaware that the appellant was on his way to the United  Kingdom
   until he arrived and made contact.

                                 Appendix C

                           Country expert evidence

Dr Stephanie Schwandner-Sievers

1. Dr Stephanie Schwandner-Sievers is an honorary research affiliate at  the
   School of Slavonic and East European Studies, UCL and consultant for  the
   International Criminal Tribunal of Yugoslavia. At  the  6  December  2010
   hearing, we heard evidence from Dr Stephanie Schwandner-Sievers, who  had
   prepared an expert report, with a supplement prepared immediately  before
   the hearing.  In her main report, dated 3 November 2009,  she  identified
   two principal reconciliation organisations in Albania, the Foundation  of
   Conflict  Resolution  and  Reconciliation  of  Disputes  [AFCR]  and  the
   Commission for National Reconciliation [CNR], headed by Gjin Marku.   Her
   main report set out the  historical  context,  confirming  that  families
   affiliated with the current Democratic Party government (the DP), such as
   (presumably)  [Clan  G],  might  have  better  access   to   authorities,
   judiciary, police support and protection, including possible  cover  ups,
   than those affiliated with the  ASP.   She  had  conducted  a  literature
   search on the appellant's account.  She found evidence of the shooting of
   his father by BG and a  police  press  release  blaming  the  appellant's
   father for drawing his gun first.  There were  only  two  reports  and  a
   press  release,  all  immediately  following  the  father's  death.   She
   regarded the appellant's self-confinement  and  that  of  his  family  as
   'culture consistent'  and  suggesting  a  deep  internalisation  of  that
   culture.  It appeared to her that  the  local  people  had  expected  the
   appellant's family to declare a blood feud. She noted difficulties in the
   evidence as to how many families were involved in blood feuds.  There was
   a vast discrepancy in the figures for those who were self-confined.  Some
   analysts discounted the first death, whereas others counted  it.   'Given
   the informal character  of  feuding...many  feuds,  revenge  threats  and
   ritual revenge killings may not be  registered  at  all  in  contemporary
   Albania'.

2. The Albanian government was addressing the problem:  blood  feud  murders
   now carried  sentences  of  up  to  25  years.   However,  there  was  no
   nationally coordinated strategy to deal with it, despite  legislation  to
   establish a Coordinating Council, it was not functioning.

3. She did not consider that the problem of blood feuds would soon cease  to
   exist  in  Albania.   Many  Albanians  did  not  perceive  Kanun  law  as
   'criminal', but rather, as 'contributing  to  local  security  and  their
   (informal) economic benefit'.  Among ordinary Albanians, there remained a
   lack of confidence in the authorities, particularly in rural  areas,  and
   Kanun-based resolution of disputes had  revived  after  the  collapse  of
   communism in 1990.  Kanun law incorporated a system of reconciliation  by
   local elders, who might or might not be affiliated either to the  CNR  or
   to the  AFCR,  another  non-governmental  organisation  which  worked  to
   reconcile feuds.

4. Nor did she accept that there was  a  modern  phenomenon  of  pre-emptive
   killings.  Such killings had  always  occurred.  Self-confinement  was  a
   strong indicator of a genuine blood feud  threat:   a  family  threatened
   with revenge killing had to keep a low profile in order  not  to  provoke
   reaction from the family of  the  person  killed.    Flight  was  another
   alternative, but both flight and self-confinement destroyed the  affected
   family's local economic and social  basis,  and  helped  to  satisfy  the
   desire for revenge of the other family.  Sometimes they  were  enough  to
   become an end in themselves.

5.  The  number  of  permanently  sequestered  children  was  unclear:   the
   Ministry of the Interior estimated there were 20 nationally, while  other
   non-governmental organisations thought the number might be as high  as  a
   few hundred.  The CNR had the  highest  estimate,  of  almost  1000.   In
   September 2009, the Albanian government had begun to offer home schooling
   support for 52 children in the Shkoder area.  The figures for  the number
   of live feuds and sequestered children were unreliable :

      "...  NGOs  dealing  with  feuding   matters,   often   dependent   on
      international donorship and interested in maintaining their object  of
      'business', have been accused of a tendency to exaggerate  the  extent
      of the phenomenon; however, they also appear to  be  the  only  agency
      that factually deals with the  problem  of  feuding  on  the  grounds.
      Various sources offer lists of Albanian NGOs dealing with blood  feuds
      in the country; however, of these many appear not to be active at all,
      perhaps have been created and disappeared in response  to  chances  of
      funding available.


      From my interviews with activists of the AFCR, ...including the  much-
      cited Aleksander Kola, I  understand,  for  example,  that  the  Peace
      Missionaries Union ...is identical with, or rather, has been  absorbed
      in, the [CNR], after peace  missionary,  Ermin  Spahiju  was  murdered
      amidst allegations of embezzlement of compensation monies and abuse of
      women seeking his support in 2004.


      In 2005, it was my impression that the AFCR and the [CNR] competed for
      both international and governmental attention and  recognition...their
      activities  on  the  ground  in  the  villages  also   seemed   mainly
      concentrated on recording conflicts and issuing certificates for which
      these organisations appear to hold a monopoly and for which they  have
      formalised procedures.  Thereby they contribute, de facto, to a  semi-
      parallel institutionalisation process of Kanun procedures, which  have
      been noted to undermine the state  and  its  institutions  notoriously
      (there are payments or 'fees' due for such certificates, and mediation
      certificates have to be rewarded with 'gifts', despite confirmation to
      the contrary that are sometimes disseminated to the press). ... It  is
      my  impression  that  apart  from  offering  home  schooling,  issuing
      certificates for payment, and engaging in  reconciliation  work  (only
      where there is deshire on both  involved  sides),  no  other  form  of
      support is available from these NGOs."

6. Reconciliation was difficult and required the will to reconcile  on  both
   sides.    The local mediators to whom she had spoken usually  recommended
   self-confinement or flight.  Post-communist  feuds which were still 'hot'
   were regarded as harder to reconcile, as were those where  the  intention
   to carry out a feud had been announced locally,  where there was thus far
   no balance of bloodshed, or where other interests continued to  fuel  the
   conflict.  She did not consider that internal relocation would be of  any
   assistance, or that there was sufficiency of protection from the Albanian
   authorities.

7. In her updated report, dated 6 December 2010, Dr  Schwandner-Sievers  set
   out fresh research opportunities which  had  come  to  her  from  various
   international  conferences.   Her  overall  opinion   had   not   changed
   substantially.  If anything, 'the risks and limits of protection  chances
   described have become even more  pronounced'.    She  was  aware  of  the
   February 2010 report of UNHCR Special  Rapporteur  Alston,  but  did  not
   uncritically agree either with his conclusions, which she  considered  to
   be too close to that of the Albanian government, or with Mr Marku's  view
   of Mr Alston's report.

8. In relation to the appellant's specific case, she was  now  able  to  say
   for certain that BG had never stood trial for his father's  death.    She
   had discovered a District Prosecutor's Order from Kuk�s on 16  May  2007,
   which she had traced from the  existing  newspaper  reports,  during  her
   broader general research into the contemporary blood feud  phenomenon  in
   Albania, with the help of  one  of  her  established  and  very  reliable
   research collaborators in Tirana, whose name she  asked  us  to  withhold
   from this decision.

Oral evidence

9. In her oral evidence at the hearing, Dr  Schwandner-Sievers  adopted  her
   reports of 3 November 2009 and 6 December 2010.

10. She was aware that it was possible to  plant  stories  in  the  Albanian
   media, by making payments.   In  general,  everything  was  for  sale  in
   Albania, which was riddled with corruption, but that did  not  mean  that
   this particular story was untrue, just  that  it  was  impossible  to  be
   certain whether it was or  not.   Every  murder  relied  upon  should  be
   considered individually to see whether it should be classified as part of
   a feud.  The examples which carried more weight,  in  her  opinion,  were
   those where the newspapers mentioned 'blood feud' (gjakmarrja).

11.  Dr  Schwandner-Sievers'  professional  opinion  was  that   attestation
   letters could also be bought.    That was the  opinion  of  many  of  her
   colleagues.   She  spoke  about  the  CNR,  and  another   widely   known
   reconciliation  commission,  the   Albanian   Foundation   for   Conflict
   Resolution and Reconciliation of Disputes (AFCR) to whom she had  talked.
   The AFCR did not accept money from individuals,  accepting  support  only
   from international donors.

12. Dr Schwandner-Sievers produced a letter and business card given  to  her
   by Gjin Marku of the  CNR  when  she  talked  to  him.   The  CNR  was  a
   problematic organisation, but it was the best  source  available.   There
   were different opinions as to how highly organised CNR was,  and  whether
   it had ever been formally registered, but she considered that the CNR had
   good access to information about cases of blood feud, through  its  local
   networks.  In her  opinion,  Mr  Marku  romanticised  the  Kanun  as  the
   solution to contemporary problems and was still very  much  part  of  the
   collectivist culture.  The CNR refused international  donations,  relying
   on charging for attestation documents. Mr Marku had built up  a  personal
   monopoly on attestation letters.   There  were  persistent  rumours  that
   false letters from him could be bought, despite what Mr Marku said to the
   contrary in his evidence.

13. She had been shown the attestation letter relied upon by the  appellant,
   and the paragraph therein listing a selection of recent blood feud  cases
   was typical of such letters.  The cases mentioned had  been  reported  in
   the Albanian media, but the overall figures were simply unknown.   It was
   entirely  possible  that  the  appellant's  parents  had  not  told   him
   everything, because  of  his  young  age.   Sometimes,  also,  it  was  a
   deliberate avoidance strategy. If the next generation was  unaware  of  a
   feud or its origins, what had been forgotten could not be brought to  the
   fore in that generation.  There were social pressures to take blood,  and
   also pressures to forgive, for the sake of community peace.

14. On the subject of pre-emptive killing,  Dr  Schwandner-Sievers  rejected
   the idea of a separate category of 'modern  blood  feud'  but  considered
   that Mr Marku  would  disagree  with  her  about  pre-emption,  since  he
   believed strongly in the codified Kanun.  The weakness  of  the  Albanian
   state, and the corrupt judiciary, were fertile conditions  for  customary
   law, as set out in the Canadian IRB response, which  had  identified  the
   concept of a 'modern blood  feud'.   The  practice  of  Kanun,  with  its
   notions of social honour, had to be differentiated from the  prescriptive
   historical text:  the printed Kanun attempted to deal  with  and  contain
   pre-emptive killing by a more important family,  but  in  practice,  pre-
   emption had always occurred and it made sense, where there was an unequal
   power balance between the two families.

15. Where a potential victim, including a pre-emptive victim,  submitted  to
   the other family by self-confinement, that action could suspend  revenge-
   taking, perhaps for generations.  Fleeing  abroad  might  have  the  same
   effect, but the aggressor would continue to be concerned that on  return,
   the senior male from the attacked clan might  revive  the  feud  or  seek
   criminal prosecution of the killer. The patrilineal line was at the  core
   of blood feud practice.

16. After reconsidering the press reports on which she  had  relied  in  her
   main report, Dr Schwandner-Sievers retracted her assertion  that  BG  had
   used an unauthorised weapon.  She had  researched  the  case  by  reading
   reports of the death of the appellant's father which had  been  published
   in Albanian national newspapers.   Despite  her  overall  concerns  about
   corruption in the Albanian press, she considered that such national  news
   sources were less likely to be open to the  planting  of  false  stories,
   although she could not exclude the possibility of  someone  having  faked
   the story.   The accounts did not appear to have been planted by a single
   source, since they varied in their approach and (slightly) in  the  facts
   reported.  Most of the reports were supportive  of  the  actions  of  the
   police officer and of Clan G, but one report  was  on  the  side  of  the
   appellant's family, Clan H.  In her opinion, the reports were genuine and
   the appellant's father had indeed been murdered.  It was  quite  possible
   that BG had enjoyed some protection from the  police  by  reason  of  his
   family connections. The DP, the current ruling party,  would  be  on  the
   side of Clan G.

17. Traffic accidents were now a common cause of blood  feud,  both  in  the
   rural areas in the north, and in cities.  Those at highest risk were  men
   of reproductive age, who were still in the labour force.   The  aggressor
   clan would hit where it hurt most. Resolution could be brokered by  local
   mayors, or teachers, based on intense social linkages.  As far as the CNR
   was concerned, she  considered  that  the  main  work  of  Mr  Marku  was
   financial, and that it was run as a business. She  had  seen  Mr  Marku's
   response to the report of Professor Alston, the UNHCR Rapporteur.   Their
   views were irreconcilable.

18.  Dr  Schwandner-Sievers  was  asked  to  comment  on  the  TB  (Albania)
   guidance.  She stated that the  theory  and  practice  of  Kanun  varied.
   Feuds went in cycles: some had already lasted hundreds of years  and  led
   to the death of fifty people,  while  others  could  be  just  beginning.
   Feuding had not been permitted during Albania's communist  period,  which
   lasted almost 50 years.  In a few cases, pre-communist feuds had  revived
   with the return of democracy and a weaker government grip on the rule  of
   law, particularly in northern Albania.

19. There was often local pressure to begin or continue the  feud:   at  the
   funeral, the dead man's widow and the funeral singer would put the eldest
   son's hand on his late  father's  forehead  and  instruct  him  to  kill.
   Families who were socially marginalised would become involved in  feuding
   in order to obtain social  recognition,  and  to  increase  the  family's
   status.   The chances of successful reconciliation were higher  when  the
   original    offence    was    a    long     time     in     the     past.





20. The debate about Kanun blood feuds had been in progress for many  years,
   and bore a close relationship to debates about  social  honour.   It  was
   very like the  Italian  approach  to  family  honour.   The  concepts  of
   hakmarrja  (taking  debt)  and  gjakmarrja  (taking  blood)   should   be
   distinguished. Gjakmarrja was linked to collectivist (that is to say, old-
   style communist) notions of solidarity and reliability.  While there  was
   more rhetoric in the north about recourse to the Kanun, that did not mean
   that a southern feud was necessarily out of the question.

21. In each case, the real dispute always concerned local politics,  status,
   and which families could impose their  superiority.   Feuds  occurred  in
   circumstances where power was under negotiation.

22.  Internal  relocation  was  of  no  use;  self-confinement  could  delay
   retribution, but leaving the country was the only way in the  long  term.
   Pursuit would only follow the potential victim after flight abroad  where
   there was a particularly powerful motive, based either on revenge or pre-
   emption.  Witness protection relied on expatriation for  protection,  but
   the difficulty was that foreign countries did  not  accept  witnesses  as
   entitled to international protection. Internally within Albania, wherever
   a person went they would be asked about their family and where they  were
   from.  You could not hide your accent.  Albania was not like  the  United
   Kingdom, where you  could  live  for  years  in  a  street  without  your
   neighbours knowing who you were.

23. In cross-examination, Dr Schwandner-Sievers said that  family  sizes  in
   Albania  were  decreasing.   She   had   checked   court   records   when
   investigating this particular allegation but was not surprised  that  the
   document purporting to be from  the  Prosecutor's  Office  was  not  then
   discovered, since it was not a court document.  She had read that not all
   such reports were published online, and district court decisions were not
   available online either.  A Soros survey showed that  half  of  Albanians
   thought that in the last five years the Albanian government had  improved
   its grip on the running of the country, but the other half were  dismally
   disappointed by its performance.  There was legislation, which  could  be
   regarded as a first step towards improvement, but the government had  yet
   to implement the steps there set out.

24. In answer to questions from the  Tribunal,  Dr  Schwandner-Sievers  said
   that although traditionally, women and young boys were not at risk, there
   had been killings of both.  People self-confined  themselves  to  contain
   any risk:  it showed respect for the  other  family,  by  keeping  a  low
   profile.  There had been plenty of events where the sanctity of the  home
   was not respected and the community had punished the offenders.  The risk
   passed traditionally from father to son.  If the deceased had a  brother,
   he would be a very important target.  The deceased's adult  brothers  and
   younger son were prime targets.

25. In re-examination, Dr  Schwandner-Sievers  said  that  patrilineage  was
   very important.  A  woman  who  married  into  another  clan  would  have
   children of a different bloodline, and would have a different  name,  and
   therefore would not be at risk in relation to her birth family.   It  was
   unusual for a  widow  to  self-confine,  because  she  did  not  share  a
   bloodline with the deceased.  It was not  culturally  impossible  if  she
   were an inciter of the feud, or the only remaining possible victim.  Self-
   confined Albanians could leave their homes in safety only by  negotiation
   with the aggressor clan, with a  time-limited  besa,  for  urgent  family
   matters such as a funeral, or for a wedding, or the presence of a foreign
   visitor.  She did not know whether it would be  possible  for  an  entire
   family in self-confinement to have access to local  authority  money;  to
   her  knowledge,  support  initiatives  were  targeted  at  children   and
   schooling.

The Alston report

26. The February 2010 report of Philip Alston, UNCHR Special  Rapporteur  on
   extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, expressed concern at  the
   resumption of blood feuds after the Communist era, in a  country  with  a
   population of over 3.2 million people at that time.   Whilst  recognising
   that blood feuds did occur, often over property or personal insults, that
   there was a lack of confidence in state resolution, and that  the  family
   of the killer would then confine itself in self-confinement, as a mark of
   respect, often for years, he was concerned as to the reliability  of  the
   evidence as to how many such feuds there were:

      "8.   There are deep discrepancies in the statistics concerning  blood
      feuds and  related  killings.  At  one  extreme,  media  reports  have
      referred to hundreds of blood feud killings per year and thousands  of
      children living in isolation.  At  the  other  extreme,  according  to
      government statistics, such killings fell steadily from 45 in 1998  to
      one in 2009, while the number of confined children ranges from  36  to
      57 countrywide, of which 29  to  45  are  in  Shkodra.  The  variation
      depended on whether the sources were  police,  education  or  ministry
      officials. Families in isolation were estimated to be from 124 and 133
      countrywide.


      9.    The figures used by civil society groups also vary  widely.  One
      organization with extensive field operations  notes  that  there  have
      been significant reductions over the last five years  and  that  there
      are currently only a few blood feud killings per year.  They  estimate
      not more than 350 families and between 80 and 100 children  to  be  in
      isolation  nationally.   However,   another   prominent   organization
      estimates some 9,800 blood feud killings since  1991,  dropping  to  a
      figure still in excess of 30 in 2009. By its calculations,  there  are
      1,450 families and 800 children in isolation.


      10.   My own carefully considered view is that the correct numbers are
      much closer  to  those  provided  by  the  government,  especially  in
      relation to killings. The figures for isolation seem more likely to be
      an underestimation, but again, not by a large margin. This is  not  to
      say that the government statistics are definitive. Their  accuracy  is
      qualified by inadequate data-gathering and recording  techniques,  and
      insufficient coordination. These  problems  were  underscored  by  the
      inconsistency of various official figures provided to me.  I  am  also
      not  aware  of  any  sustained  government  effort  to  reconcile  the
      competing statistics. Four factors account for the discrepancies among
      the  various  figures:  definitional   differences:   under-reporting;
      limited coverage of issues; and incentives to overstate.


      12.   In terms of definitions, different actors tend to use  different
      meanings of the term "blood feud" and of "blood  feud  killings".  The
      narrowest ("traditional") understanding is that a blood  feud  killing
      is a premeditated familial avenging of lost blood - that is, where the
      family of a murdered victim kills a member of the perpetrator's family
      to restore the honour and blood  lost  as  a  result  of  the  initial
      murder. A less strict interpretation classifies  any  revenge  killing
      between families as a blood feud regardless of any  reference  to  the
      need to restore blood and honour or of guidance by  any  Kanun-related
      considerations. Both of these understandings  are  reflected  in  most
      police and court statistics, especially since it is difficult to prove
      any  specific  cultural  motivation  for   a   killing.   In   broader
      definitions, any  premeditated  murder  motivated  by  any  reason  of
      revenge (hakmarrja) between families could be  a  blood  feud  killing
      (gjakmarrja). In still broader understandings, even a revenge  killing
      without a familial dimension (e.g. killings between  gangs)  could  be
      counted as blood feuds.  The broadest and most questionable definition
      would count any killing because  it  may,  at  some  point,  lead  the
      victim's family to seek revenge against the perpetrator's  family.  An
      equally questionable approach is to count among families characterized
      as self-confined "due to blood feud" cases in  which  no  killing  had
      occurred and without any strong or formal element of self-confinement,
      but where a physical assault, a threat or  some  intense  dispute  had
      created a family or neighbourly feud.


      13.   A second factor is under-reporting.  Killings  in  remote  areas
      might not be systematically reported. Moreover, in some instances, the
      families might want to avoid all State involvement in order to  pursue
      traditional  remedies.  In  addition,  statistics   based   on   court
      judgements may be a poor indicator of blood feud killings because  the
      perpetrator of a premeditated blood feud killing may be  found  guilty
      of a lesser charge, whether because of insufficient evidence, a family
      refusal to testify or corruption leading to a conviction for a  lesser
      offence.


      14.    Thirdly,  the  coverage  of  government   programmes   may   be
      incomplete. For example, government figures on children  in  isolation
      are based on its "Second Chance" home-schooling programme, which  goes
      only through  ninth  grade.  Older  children  are  thus  not  covered.
      Similarly, a combined focus on those killed and the  number  of  self-
      confined children will go only part of the way towards  capturing  the
      overall number of people whose lives are seriously affected  by  blood
      feuds.


      15.   A fourth factor is the existence of incentives for  some  groups
      to overstate the magnitude of the problem in  order  to  get  funding.
      While various non-governmental organizations do extremely good work on
      these issues,  many  officials  and  independent  observers  expressed
      concern that a small number of groups deliberately exaggerate for fund-
      raising purposes. International donors do not help the situation  when
      they  provide  funding  for  blood  feud-related  programmes   without
      adequate scrutiny."

27. Mr Alston considers that the corruption  which  runs  deep  in  Albanian
   society has infected the provision of attestation certificates  and  that
   many of the non-governmental organisations exist in  order  to  milk  the
   international community for funding, thus  giving  them  an  interest  in
   exaggerating the real level of  live  feuds.   The  linguistic  confusion
   between genuine 'blood-taking' and any death at all renders  the  various
   statistics almost impossible to compare.  His view overall is that  there
   remain very few feuds and very few families in self-confinement.

Mr Gjin Marku and the CNR

28. The appellant relied on an attestation letter, signed by Mr  Marku,  CNR
   Chairman, confirming his involvement in a blood feud and that he would be
   at risk on return.    There  were  two  letters.   The  first,  dated  12
   December 2008 consisted of only three lines, asserting the  existence  of
   the feud.

29. The second, dated 3 December 2010, is typical of those produced  by  the
   CNR and relied upon by appellants. It reads as follows:

      "Confirmation                           Tirana 3 December 2010


      [CNR] confirms that it has archived and pursued the blood feud  matter
      between the family of [the appellant] and [Clan G].   The  blood  feud
      has arisen because the old times rivalry between the clans  and  later
      political quarrels, with the latter event leading to  the  insult  and
      infringement of dignity between the parties and  reaching  the  climax
      three years ago with the bloodshed; whereas [the  appellant's  father]
      fell dead, the father of [the appellant].


      [Clan G], which has connection  with  the  government  and  gangs  has
      continually threatened the life of  [the  appellant]  even  after  the
      killing of [his father].  The most threatened  person  has  been  [the
      appellant] who has attempted to pursue his father's murder  case  with
      the state police and the Public Prosecution Office.


      We have contacted [Clan G] but they confirm that they had reasons  and
      still have reasons to kill and also still have to take  blood  because
      the matters are deeper from what they seem.

      The blood feuds during the year 2010 have increased  even  leading  to
      terrorist acts.  At the end of July there were  7  killings  involving
      the blood feud and honour.  On the 12th, 13th and 14th of August 2010,
      media published sensational killings for blood feud;  the  well  known
      wrestler Leonard Bilal in Tirane, Ndue Lleshi in Mirdite because of 70
      years old feud and Mario Curri in Durres, whom the father, nephew, and
      a friend were killed for the same feud.  Some time ago there  was  TNT
      (bomb) placed at the family of Petrit Brahaj in Tropoje and  policeman
      Kol Ndreshaj from Malsia e Madhe was executed during the  night,  both
      of them were in blood feud.  On 3rd October in Vlore, a  27  year  old
      was killed in front of his 12 year old  nephew,  whereas  on  the  8th
      October 2010, pastor D Prroni was killed in Shkodra, who had come  out
      of the besiegement in order to spread out the word of  God.   On  17th
      October 2010 a policeman was killed because of blood feud; whereas  on
      23rd and 25th of October 2010 was  killed  Bujar  Zebi  in  Diber  and
      chairman of Terthor Commune in Kuk�s Remzi  Veseli.   On  the  9th  of
      November 2010, because of property disputes, was killed 55  years  old
      Rifat Sula and his 25 years old Izmir Sula was killed in the  town  of
      Shijak; whereas on 21st of November  2010  in  the  centre  of  Tirana
      because of blood feud was killed 45 years old  Mirash  Pali;  who  had
      just returned from emigration; this  killing  was  followed  by  three
      other killings between young men because of  blood  feud;  whereas  on
      29th of November, another emigrant, Dritan Skenderaj was killed  after
      returning to Albania.


      [CNR] confirms that [the appellant] and his family are  threatened  by
      this blood feud at any moment and in any part of Albanian territory.


      For [CNR]
      Chairman
      Gjin Marku"                                  [Emphasis added]

   The parts of the letter in italics, dealing with  the  appellant's  blood
   feud, lack detail. The long paragraph dealing  with  2010  deaths  simply
   asserts that each of these various deaths was caused  by  a  blood  feud.
   The  deaths  there  mentioned  have  no  nexus   with   the   appellant's
   circumstances.

30. Mr Marku's witness statement, prepared in February 2011, was  in  fairly
   broad terms.  He stated that the CNR was a non-governmental organisation,
   providing  assistance  to  those  involved  in  blood  feuds,  and  their
   families, by mediating the conflicts.  He referred us to www.pajtimi.com,
   the CNR's public website.  At paragraph 3 of the statement, Mr Marku  set
   out the philosophy of the CNR:

      "3.   The goal of the [CNR]  is  to  cultivate  humane  standards  and
      preserve fine customs so that citizens and  their  families  can  live
      happily in their community and in their brotherhood knowing  that  the
      rule of law is the norm and have no fear that  their  families,  their
      economy would be adversely affected by anyone. The Committee  aims  to
      inculcate  the  culture  of  reconciliation  contrary  to  hatred  and
      revenge; to promote dialogue between opposing parties  as  a  sign  of
      mutual tolerance in search of truth and justice that are the essential
      elements of a genuine reconciliation.  The  [CNR]  requires  of  every
      Albanian and every human to take the  responsibility  of  making  this
      place a better world.  The magazine 'Law and Justice' published by the
      CNR with the goal of spreading the culture of law in all levels of the
      society has been highly valued by  common  readers  and  intellectuals
      alike."

31. It was the view of the CNR that  the  Albanian  state  did  not  have  a
   proper or effective blood  feud  strategy.   Such  a  strategy  had  been
   drafted by the CNR and presented to all levels of  government,  following
   the CNR's most recent conference, held in Tirana  in  October  2010.  One
   resolution in particular, resolution 6, is worth reproducing in full:

      "6.   The Conference urges the High Council of Justice to bring an end
      to the practice of submission of 'Reconciliation Certificates' to  the
      Courts;  attestation letters of this kind  are  issued  by  fraudulent
      'associations' for the purpose of reducing  killers'  convictions  and
      this practice has caused tragic incidents because  of  killers'  early
      release and short sentencing.  The CNR has made  several  requests  to
      the Courts not to allow such practice with  serious  implications  and
      has informed the Albanian government  that  such  practice  undermines
      justice and the rule of law."

32.  Mr  Marku  stressed  that  resolution  of  blood  feuds  required   the
   cooperation of all parties. He had checked  that  the  appellant's  blood
   feud attestation letter was a genuine one, issued by the CNR  and  signed
   by him.  Attestation letters produced by the CNR were signed only  by  Mr
   Marku.  They were not for sale.

Mr Marku's oral evidence

33. Mr Marku gave oral evidence over a period of two days, the  first  being
   spent on additional  evidence-in-chief  and  the  second  day  on  cross-
   examination, Tribunal questions and re-examination. His evidence  covered
   the history and present structure of the  CNR;  his  own  and  the  CNR's
   interactions with other actors of protection and  international  experts;
   the records kept by the CNR and the validity of its statistical  evidence
   in relation to those of the Albanian government  and  other  actors;  the
   types of murders taking place in Albania; and the origin and validity  of
   blood feud attestation letters issued by the  CNR.   He  was  invited  to
   comment on the report for the OHCHR of Special Rapporteur Peter Alston.

Structure of the CNR

34. Mr Marku said that  the  CNR's  work  had  begun  in  about  1990  on  a
   charitable basis, and in 2000  it  was  legally  registered  pursuant  to
   specific legislation.  The head office of the CNR was  based  in  Tirana,
   with Mr Marku himself as its chairman, supported by a Founding Board with
   five members.  Below  that  Board  was  an  Advisory  Committee  with  30
   members.  The same structure was repeated  in  the  north  and  south  of
   Albania, in Puk� in the north and Luzhna in the south.   Each had a local
   chairman, two Board members, and about  12  Advisory  Committee  members.
   The Boards and Committees worked together under  the  leadership  of  the
   chairman.  The Board Members were  senior  people:   retired  judges  and
   solicitors, professional historians, and politicians, some of whom  still
   worked in local government. Advisory Committee members  were  people  who
   knew the area and some of them also were current government employees.

35. There were 32 sub-branches covering  most  of  Albania's  37  districts.
   All CNR workers were volunteers.  The same structure  was  replicated  in
   many villages, although people moved around, and some of  the  structures
   functioned better than others.  It  was  a  traditional  structure,  pre-
   dating the present legal structure and was  as  old  as  the  blood  feud
   tradition itself:  they  went  together.   Reconciliation  could  not  be
   achieved by payment.  Those who worked in the CNR  brought  to  it  their
   goodwill and desire to help reconcile  feuds,  with  the  will  of  those
   involved, and by consent.

36. Mr Marku was the grandson of  a  well-known  mediator  with  a  national
   reputation; he was honorary chairman of the CNR  Founding  Board  and  as
   such responsible for administrative matters overall.  He did not  take  a
   salary: there were no funds for salaries.  He worked  for  the  CNR  full
   time, along with his wife.  Fortunately they  were  both  well  off.   Mr
   Marku had worked in the Albanian security services.  He and his wife  had
   a farm and two hotels in their village.  His wife worked as a teacher and
   also contributed to the work of several NGOs.

37. From time to time, when funding was available,  the  CNR  held  national
   conferences to discuss matters of general interest, the outcome of  which
   was published on its website.  There had been one such in  Puk�  in  June
   2001 where members from the principal offices in Tirana, Luzhna, and Puk�
   as well as one or two members from  all  the  district  offices,  met  to
   discuss the organisation's structure.  It was  decided  then  that  there
   should be at least three CNR members  in  every  village,  typically  the
   school headmaster, the most respected local elder and a representative of
   local government. These people were together described as  reconciliation
   'missionaries'.  The structure had the support of the judges  and  Courts
   in Albania. He stated categorically that the CNR did not accept money for
   reconciliation.  They might  accept  a  car,  or  a  car  might  be  made
   available.

38. The village chairman would be the oldest person in  the  first  clan  in
   the village.  Such people deserved and  got  respect.   If  they  decided
   something, a man would go and do it.  Mediation took  place  by  chatting
   over coffee and cigarettes, and often no notes at all would be taken  for
   fear of disturbing the delicate social balance.  The spoken word and  the
   spoken promise were all-important; once a man's word was given, it  would
   be kept as a matter of honour, and that was  how  reconciliation  worked.
   The reconciliation process could take years:  many feuds  had  lasted  70
   years, and there were many examples of reconciliation after periods of 70
   years also, given the interruption of all blood  feuds  for  the  50-year
   communist  period.   The  Communist  Party  dictatorship  had  been  very
   repressive, but it took care of the blood feuds during that time.  He was
   only aware of two blood feuds, both dating back to his  childhood,  which
   had continued to function in the communist period. Schoolchildren  during
   communism were taught that value was very important.

Blood feuds and honour killings

39. The Albanian word for a traditional blood feud was  'gjakmarrja'  (terms
   used in international reports include 'vendetta' and 'vigilante killings'
   for  the  same  concept)  and  for  an  honour  killing  was  'hakmarrja'
   (revenge).  Confusion in the  use  of  the  two  terms  led  to  confused
   actions.  The classic, traditional blood feuds generated over  the  years
   were based on the thinking in the Kanun, but applied by those who did not
   properly understand Kanun.  This resulted  in  what  he  described  as  a
   'twisted and deformed psychology' in  some  feuds,  with  the  combatants
   respecting Kanun without properly knowing its laws.  There was a lack  of
   state power or regulation by the Albanian government.  Hakmarrja disputes
   could be solved without a blood feud and they  were  usually  related  to
   land disputes, but  gjakmarrja  (blood  feud)  included  the  concept  of
   revenge. Gjakmarrja was the traditional Kanun way and could be ended only
   by besa (forgiveness)  after  sometimes  years  of  patient  negotiation.
   Feuds and reconciliations lasting 70 years were not unknown.

40. The blood feud system had been  interrupted  for  50  years  during  the
   communist era. The Communist Party government had been  repressive,   and
   it simply had not permitted blood feuds to proceed.  Even  so,  Mr  Marku
   was aware of two feuds which had continued,  at  least  to  some  extent,
   during that period:  the murders dated back to his childhood.

41. Mr Marku considered that the government data understated the  prevalence
   of blood feuds.  He asserted that the CNR data was more accurate  because
   of the direct involvement it had at district level and that the  CNR  had
   no interest in inflating the figures for blood feud.  Albanian government
   figures had always been lower than the real levels for blood feuds.   The
   government's response to criminality overall was inadequate, which tended
   to drive Albanians back to using the Kanun law system to achieve justice.
    The government had covered up and been silent and now had no credibility
   in the debate.  In this part of Mr Marku's evidence, he tended to  answer
   questions with a prepared answer, rather than dealing with  the  question
   direct.

42.   Mr Marku accepted that some important steps  had  been  taken  in  the
   last five  years.   There  was  a  coordinating  commission,  created  by
   statute, headed by the President of the Republic of Albania.  It was  not
   supported financially by the Albanian government and had only met once in
   the five years since it was formed.  The President had attended the third
   Congress of the Reconciliation Missionaries and Observers, and  had  been
   critical  of  what  was  achieved  so  far.   He  considered   that   the
   missionaries should have achieved more than they had, and that it was bad
   and serious for Albania, as a member  of  NATO,  to  have  this  kind  of
   problem.  He had expressed the highest appreciation for the work done  by
   the  missionaries  and  observers.   The  position  was  impossible:  the
   government had produced no results itself.

43. Dealing with hakmarrja, Mr Marku said that describing  property  motives
   as 'weak' was a communist  term.   Murders  could  arise  from  riots,  a
   person's dignity or honour, or as a result of thefts.  It was  completely
   unclear how the division fell between gjakmarrja and hakmarrja,  both  in
   the communist period and after it.  In his view,  most  murders  happened
   due to honour and should be so recorded. Sometimes a  vendetta  could  be
   sparked by someone refusing to give way on a  single  lane  highway,  and
   such road rage incidents could lead on to murder. It was  very  difficult
   for the Albanian police to treat and tackle the  problem,  although  they
   were aware of the difficulties.

44. Overall, Mr  Marku  considered  that  government  support  for  his  own
   organisation and for reconciliation  generally  was  more  apparent  than
   real.  The government wanted to look good to the  outside  world.     The
   CNR had expressed its support for the government and the police in public
   and would continue  to  do  so.  Ambassadors  from  other  countries  had
   observed that the police officers changed  and  reacted  when  government
   chased them up, but not otherwise.  The former Minister  of  the  Economy
   had stated publicly that he had  been  afraid  to  report  six  years  of
   official corruption, of which he had been aware at the time, for fear  of
   being killed.  300 people had been killed after prisoners  were  released
   without serving all of their sentences.

45. Mr Marku stated that his paperwork was a case  of  working  'in  chaos'.
   Some cases had no files or notes at all; others  might  only  have  three
   pieces of paper in them.  He had successfully reconciled the  case  of  a
   girl whose leg was accidentally amputated, and in that case  he  had  not
   taken a single note.

46. Mr Marku was asked how he could be sure of the figures given  for  blood
   feuds by the CNR, given that he kept no records of many of them.  He said
   that the figures fluctuated from month to month, and were based partly on
   reports from the missionaries in the local areas, which he had no way  of
   checking.  They only reported conflicts considered to be  'serious':   he
   insisted that the CNR figures were exact as to 'conflicts going to  blood
   feuds, or new possible blood feuds'.   They  also  contacted  local  land
   registries and included any ongoing land disputes, which were reported by
   a liaison officer for land  registries,  appointed  six  or  seven  years
   earlier. They classified  that  link  as  'gratitude  of  the  government
   towards our serious work'. The land registry liaison officer was paid  by
   the Albanian government and reported the number of land disputes  to  the
   government.  In  addition,  they  monitored  information  in  the  media.
   Murders were reported as having taken  place,  and  in  some  cases,  the
   family itself did not know they had  a  conflict.    The  media  reported
   murders which had taken place, giving figures obtained  from  the  police
   and also from the CNR.  He gave examples of some recent feuds:  a  father
   in Malesi e Malde had killed his son for breaking up with his fianc�e;  a
   newly-married wife was killed by her Mafioso husband,  who  doubted  that
   the child she carried was his.

47. The CNR figures  included  cases  reported  from  the  field,  including
   figures for self-judgment arising from  prostitution,  honour,  property,
   murders, rows and fights.  The CNR would then provide a total figure  for
   conflicts, and how they needed  to  be  resolved  before  they  ended  in
   murder.   He did  not  accept  that  there  had  been  any  reduction  in
   conflicts over the last five years:  rather, he considered that there had
   been a 30-40% increase over the last two years, and that  police  figures
   were significantly under-reported.   He assured us that the  CNR  figures
   were based on the reality in Albania and that there was no  link  between
   international funding and the  number  of  conflicts  reported.   On  the
   contrary, it was in the government's interest  to  deflate  the  figures.
   Others in  government  were  lobbying  to  prepare  corrupt  figures  for
   favours.

48. Over the last 20 years, of 5000 families in conflict, the CNR  had  made
   it possible for 800 of  them  to  go  into  reconciliations.   The  local
   missionaries and authorised representatives would verify the existence of
   the feud.  The communication was  oral  and  there  were  no  letters  or
   documents to support such verification.  An attestation letter was issued
   when the CNR had been unable to reconcile the parties.   When the CNR had
   participated in the two national Congresses (the Exemplary Conferences of
   Peace Missionaries on 13 March 2009 and 8 October  2010)  the  point  had
   been made that keeping files would  be  good  practice.    The  resultant
   resolution appeared on the CNR's website.  It was put to  Mr  Marku  that
   the system, as it stood, was open to abuse  and  false  information.   He
   stated that a man who was no longer associated with the CNR, Mr Loci, had
   produced false letters on more than one occasion.   Abuse  could  not  be
   excluded, but from the CNR's side, they did not wish  to  associate  with
   anyone like that.

49. The CNR had good but serious relations  with  the  Albanian  government:
   successive prime ministers had been appreciative of  their  efforts,  but
   the CNR felt  free  to  criticise  the  government.   The  current  prime
   minister had stated in the  Albanian  parliament  that  the  missionaries
   undertook work which the government could not. However, in  general,  the
   ministers did not concentrate on this aspect or react well  to  criticism
   from the CNR.   Reconciling blood feuds was not a matter for  the  state,
   but for tradition.  Deputies faced with blood feud problems in their  own
   family would telephone Mr Marku directly.

50. Of course, the CNR encouraged parties to use the legal system and  avoid
   future tragedy.  The intervention or mediation alternative was a good one
   which sometimes worked; the CNR had supported and defended the police  in
   public, even though they were not  involved  in  reconciliation.    There
   were situations where they needed police  cooperation  and  the  CNR  was
   aware of the need to keep good relations.   One obstacle was the level of
   police corruption. Once it became a blood feud,  it  had  never  happened
   that the state had been able to resolve the situation. Such matters would
   be clearer for Albanians:  the state had expressed  non-involvement.  The
   Albanian state was not efficient  and  the  public,  although  it  wanted
   assistance, had no confidence that the state would provide it. Deaths  of
   women and children did occur, but rarely, and the death of  a  child  was
   always a tragedy.

51. In cross-examination Mr Marku was given an opportunity to comment on  Dr
   Schwandner-Sievers' evidence and Professor Alston's report.  Mr Marku was
   dismissive of  the  expertise  of  both  of  them.   He  considered  that
   Professor Alston was mistaken in his  assessment  of  the  prevalence  of
   blood feuds and in accepting broadly the Albanian government figures.  He
   characterised Professor Alston's opinion as 'outside  reality',  although
   he noted that Professor Alston had visited the  self-confined  policeman,
   Pjetr Tabakaj,  and  the  Tabakaj  family.   The  CNR  had  responded  to
   Professor Alston on the Pajtimi website.  He  stood  by  what  was  there
   said.  He was seeking support for Albania as a country, not  for  himself
   or  his  organisation.  He  did  not  consider  it  appropriate  to  seek
   international funding for the organisation.  The magazine  it  published,
   'Law and Life' was UN-funded and in addition, the CNR made profits on the
   conference. In  a  few  cases,  those  whom  the  CNR  helped  also  made
   contributions, which were used for the confined families, or to help with
   transport for the missionaries to attend  a  mission.   The  CNR  central
   recommended a fixed contribution from the relatives of  Lek  1500  (about
   $15) per day in such cases.  Gifts from relatives were  not  common:   it
   was  difficult  for  the  reconciliation  missionaries  to  ask   for   a
   contribution, but  if  it  was  offered,  they  could  accept  it.    The
   missionaries and the central office gave up their time,  paid  their  own
   expenses, and recorded all contributions on the website.

52. Mr Marku believed he had met Dr Schwandner-Sievers, and if  it  was  the
   same person he remembered, she had given him a document in English  which
   he had not read.  Based on a quick glance, he did not  consider  that  it
   looked very professional.  He remembered that she was well-respected, but
   considered that the work had been  done  rather  quickly.   He  preferred
   either the views of Antonia Young or Colin  Freeman,  both  of  whom  had
   spent time with Mr Marku.  The appellant did not call either Ms Young  or
   Mr Freeman as a witness or provide expert reports from them.

53. The Albanian government's  data  was  inadequate:   the  government  had
   always given lower figures compared to the reality, and the CNR's figures
   were more accurate.   The inadequate government response led Albanians to
   use the Kanun to obtain justice; it was impossible for the government  to
   be involved, since it had covered up and been silent.  He  accepted  that
   there were structures in place, but the government had only financed  one
   meeting of the coordinating commission in the last five years; they  then
   expressed the highest appreciation of the work done by peace missionaries
   and observers.  It was very serious for the Albanian government, a member
   of NATO, to have such a problem  on  its  shoulders.    The  police  were
   reluctant to become involved; they knew the difficulties.

54. Mr Marku expanded on the system of reconciliation.  It was  carried  out
   over coffee and cigarettes, or by telephone, as often and for as long  as
   was necessary.  The initial conversation with family members of the self-
   confined person could last up  to  two  hours,  and  sometimes  (but  not
   always)  he took notes.  He needed to know the people and  the  situation
   really well in order to find a way through for reconciliation.  He  would
   talk to peace  missionaries  in  the  region,  and  with  the  CNR  board
   representative for the area. It was very important  to  get  the  correct
   information.  Mr Marku received about three or  four  such  complaints  a
   day, and his organisation issued 5-6 attestation letters monthly, all  of
   which he signed personally.

55. In answer to questions from the Tribunal,  Mr  Marku  acknowledged  that
   until the introduction of the numbering system after October 2010, it had
   been relatively easy to forge CNR attestation letters. He  was  asked  to
   comment on the Canadian IRB and Caritas assertions that the CNR  was  the
   only organisation with systematic and competent records:  Mr  Marku  said
   that he continued to assert that CNR worked in chaos, but that in  asylum
   cases, they had the records. The Canadian Embassy in  Rome  had  come  to
   inspect their files.  They had done so regularly and  been  grateful  for
   the information and for inspecting the files. The CNR cooperated, through
   emails, and replied to specific questions when asked.

56. The Ministry of Social Work in Albania recommended that every person  in
   blood feud had to approach the CNR.    He had the recommendation  at  the
   Tirana office of the CNR, sealed  with  both  of  the  Ministry's  secure
   seals. He referred to an audio report in  the  Southeast  European  Times
   (www.setimes.com) by Linda Karadaku, based on an interview with Mr Marku.
    His office issued between two and six attestation letters a  month,  and
   in some months, none at all.  Half of those went overseas, the rest being
   used to obtain Social  Services'  support  locally.  Attestation  letters
   almost always included paragraphs containing recent unrelated  incidents,
   to give examples of the type of killing and make sure the information was
   local.   The Foundation for Conflict Resolution, an organisation  of  the
   Catholic Church in Shkoder, supported by  Caritas,  and  Caritas  itself,
   cooperated well with CNR.  The Institute of Free Will,  supported  by  US
   funds, was a project in Shkoder and had concluded that  the  CNR  figures
   were close to reality, but perhaps under-stated.

The appellant's case and the CNR attestation letters

57. Mr Marku gave evidence  of  his  knowledge  of  the  situation  of  this
   particular appellant, on which  he  had  based  the  attestation  letters
   before us.  He had brought with him what  he  said  was  a  copy  of  the
   original attestation letter from the CNR files.

58. Mr Marku produced two other documents, to  which  we  permitted  him  to
   refer as an aide memoire, the first being a note he claimed to have taken
   as part of a general discussion of blood feud with  the  local  Chief  of
   Police in Has, in which the subject of this feud had arisen, and  he  had
   placed a copy in the blood feud  file  because  he  was  aware  that  the
   appellant was making an asylum claim  in  the  United  Kingdom;  and  the
   second, a chronology of the history of this particular  feud.   Mr  Marku
   said that before coming to the United Kingdom to give  evidence,  he  had
   jotted down his recollection of the people he had contacted,  because  he
   had inadequate notes on the blood feud file.  In  each  case,  the  notes
   were previously undisclosed and written in untranslated Albanian.

59. Mr Marku's opinion was that the feud here was not a classic Kanun  blood
   feud. His organisation had kept records of it, denoting it as  relatively
   intensive, although the only killing had been in 2007.  Mr Marku accepted
   that it was the appellant's turn to kill but considered that, even though
   he was a peaceful person, he would not dare fail to carry  out  the  next
   killing.  His relatives would urge him to do it.  Mr Marku accepted  that
   the appellant's paternal uncles  had  distanced  themselves,  but  others
   within the Clan H would 'throw words' and urge the appellant to act.   Mr
   Marku had not met the appellant.  Although the death had been in 2007, it
   was not until 2010 that the family had considered it necessary to seek an
   attestation letter from CNR.  He agreed this was  not  a  standard  blood
   feud but asserted that in the north of Albania, such feuds  as  this  did
   occur.

60. Asked about CNR's record keeping system, Mr Marku's  evidence  was  that
   there  was  no  official  procedure  similar  to  that   of   the   state
   administration or the courts. Where very  deep  matters  were  concerned,
   where the family was  unable  to  pursue  it  elsewhere,  the  CNR  would
   register the blood feuds and keep some records, following  them  up  with
   conversational communication.   His  evidence  was  that  there  were  no
   records, but that the organisation sometimes took notes and filed  those.
   Not many notes were taken, for fear  of  offending  the  dignity  of  the
   person who was seeking their help.    He  personally  took  no  notes  in
   reconciliations, but his reconciliations were successful.  (However,  his
   evidence was that he had taken some notes  in  relation  to  the  present
   claimed feud).

61. The appellant's family had  approached  the  CNR  on  16  October  2007,
   according to Mr Marku's aide m�moire.  He stated that sometimes he forgot
   and put the wrong date on notes.  Mr Marku was asked to explain  why  the
   attestation letter referred to a longstanding  rivalry  between  the  two
   families before the present issue:  Mr Marku  said  that  was  his  clear
   recollection of conversations that he had with the missionaries  in  this
   case.  It was a typical North Albanian situation.  Every clan  wanted  to
   be the top clan. The murder had not been committed in  the  heat  of  the
   moment; there were deep problems and he usually preferred not to go  into
   deep matters, as it might reveal something which the  mediators  did  not
   want to know, in this case, a previous rivalry or conflict which had  not
   come to light.  He was asked how this answer fitted with his assertion in
   his evidence-in-chief that each case was considered deeply, to understand
   the exact issue.  Mr Marku replied that there was no conflict:   the  CNR
   would look deeply into the issue, but not  behind  it.   One  had  to  be
   careful not to touch on an explosive underlying problem.

62. AG, the eldest brother of Clan G, had put pressure  on  the  appellant's
   father in 2005 not to challenge them for the Socialist Party; Clan G  was
   a dangerous family.  The appellant's father did not accept the  pressure.
   Mr Marku understood that insults had been exchanged which Clan G did  not
   accept.  That was the reason for the killing of the  appellant's  father,
   and the appellant's  complaint  to  the  police  had  made  Clan  G  more
   aggressive. The appellant's late father had reported the  threat  to  the
   police himself.  Clan G had not cooperated with the  missionaries:   they
   told them not to approach again as Clan G 'knew how to deal with it'.

63. AG was the person of authority within Clan G.  He had  heard  that  they
   were a 'cocky' family, who thought the best of themselves.   He  had  not
   attempted to verify the account of the 2005  incident  with  the  police.
   The missionaries had told him that the deceased had verbal conflicts with
   people, and his death resulted  from  the  report  to  the  police.   The
   missionaries went to Clan G on several occasions and  were  finally  told
   not to come there again. The police in such  cases  were  often  involved
   with the powerful clan themselves; there was no point in checking  police
   records.  Clan G came from an area near Tropoja, and  Tropoja  ruled  the
   police.

64. Mr Marku gave an example:  DD, a large-scale drug  dealer,  killed  four
   police officers when he was captured.  The  relevance  of  that  case  to
   blood feud or this appeal is unclear.   In the present case, as so often,
   there had been no need for him to look for information:  it came to  him.
   One member of Clan G, BG, was a police  officer.  He  was  aware  of  the
   Police Corruption Ombudsman: the CNR had links with him and he was one of
   the CNR's best partners and collaborators.  The  previous  ombudsman  had
   been very interested in blood feuds and was the  only  state  institution
   which  had  thanked  western  countries  such  as   Germany   for   their
   contributions and for giving international protection to those whose life
   was in danger.   The ombudsman's attitude was that western support was of
   great help in early conciliation.   Avenues  of  redress  against  police
   officials did  not  solve  the  problem.  The  ombudsman  found  for  the
   claimants in 1/3 of the complaints to him. The other  northern  clans  in
   Kukas, Tropoje and Has, were so strong that 11 people had self-confined.

65. He understood from the missionaries that the appellant  had  been  close
   to his father and had reported his death to the police station. Asked why
   no attack had occurred against the deceased's other male family  members,
   Mr Marku observed that the uncles had distanced themselves, and that Clan
   G were not much interested in attacking the appellant's uncles.   He  did
   not wish to speak about the internal relations of the appellant's family,
   because the aggressors could benefit.  The first person in danger was the
   son of the murdered father, who would remain at risk, even if he  behaved
   like an angel.

66. Mr Marku had received signals that the rest of Clan H felt  the  danger,
   and he was concerned that other evil mechanisms might come into  play  to
   eliminate the parties. Clan H could be wiped  out,  because  Clan  G  was
   powerful.  The appellant was still a child; the family had approached CNR
   without telling him they were doing so, to try to distance him  from  the
   problem.  The rest of the family would, of course, be fully aware of  the
   involvement of the CNR.

67. Mr Marku was asked what the reference to matters 'deeper than what  they
   seem' in the attestation letter meant.  He said that would have come from
   the missionaries on the ground.  He acknowledged that  the  next  killing
   should be by Clan H, but that his information was  that  they  dared  not
   take on Clan G.  However, although the appellant was a  peaceful  person,
   Mr Marku remained convinced that  he  would  be  urged  by  relatives  to
   retaliate.  He accepted that the appellant's uncles on his father's  side
   had distanced themselves, but other members of the clan would throw words
   at the appellant and urge him to act.  He did not accept that  the  final
   sentence of his letter, stating  that  the  appellant's  family  were  in
   danger at any moment, was an exaggeration.

68. The geographical reach of Clan G was mainly in Has.  However,  they  had
   businesses in Tirana and elsewhere in Albania.   Even  if  the  appellant
   temporarily relocated, he would not be safe.  In other cases of which  Mr
   Marku was aware, those in hiding elsewhere in Albania had been found  and
   killed. An ambush was easy to organise and the perpetrator would never be
   found.  Even if the appellant told Clan G, through the CNR, that he would
   not kill in return, Mr Marku did not consider that without a public  besa
   or forgiveness, Clan G could be trusted to respect that.

69. Ms Gough had no further questions arising out of our questions.   In re-
   examination, Mr Marku confirmed that, within the CNR,  he  was  the  only
   person who signed attestation letters.  The CNR board had decided that no
   one else would be permitted to do so.  If asked by  the  respondent,  the
   CNR would cooperate respectfully with any request for verification  of  a
   particular attestation letter.  He now said that he had many notes, here,
   there and everywhere, but his notes were unsystematic.  He  would  prefer
   to file them systematically, since  he  could  not  remember  everything.
   There was a lot to improve.  Such information as he did keep was entirely
   accurate.  He tried to keep a record of the essential matters to give the
   CNR an orientation. The lack of records  had  not  been  an  obstacle  in
   verifying attestation letters.

70. The information on the attestation letters generally came  to  Mr  Marku
   over the phone, from local missionaries.  He kept a note of who gave  him
   the information.  His notes were often not dated:  he did  not  have  the
   time  or  the  attention  to  do  so.   He  forgot  the   technicalities.
   Sometimes, he did record the date, but when someone came to one's  office
   with such a problem, it was impossible not to feel  emotional  about  it.
   The government was concerned when people  in  confinement  moved  to  the
   city, that the rural feuds might begin to spread to  metropolitan  areas.
   The government was well aware of the blood feud difficulty but  was  also
   aware that it would not be wise to publicise it.

71. Mr Marku never issued an attestation letter if there was no blood  feud.
    There had to be notes, and he had to be aware of the  facts.   Difficult
   cases, for which the CNR opened a file, were followed up.  The CNR worked
   to resolve as many blood feuds as possible, but where there was  a  file,
   bureaucracy  was  required.   For  example,  the  Luxembourg  Immigration
   Ministry had concerns and wanted to verify a blood  feud.   He  had  sent
   verifications, but the local committee member in the area had passed away
   and the work had not been finished.   He  trusted  the  missionaries  and
   would not have come to London to give evidence if he were not telling the
   truth.  Where a matter such as this was involved, it  was  necessary  for
   the information to be correct.  One of his concerns was that there should
   be more information.   It  was  impossible  to  exclude  a  risk  to  the
   appellant's family, even if Clan G were to promise  to  take  no  further
   action:  they might break that promise.

The Marku investigation

72. On 22 February 2012, the appellant's representatives produced a  further
   witness statement for Mr Marku.  No leave had been  sought  to  introduce
   this additional evidence but, in the interests of justice, we  considered
   it. The statement indicated that Mr Marku had been re-interviewed by  the
   Albanian police in Tirana on 8 February 2012.  The police told him that a
   claim had been made that he had  provided  false  documents  relating  to
   blood feuds and accepted money for doing so.  They had not told  him  who
   made the claim.  He was told that the investigation was routine, and  was
   asked to provide documents to the police 'so that  they  could  ascertain
   the way in which the CNR operated and how  documents  relating  to  blood
   feuds were issued and verified'.

73. Mr Marku told the police that the allegation was nonsense,  but  he  had
   cooperated.  He offered them the opportunity to inspect the CNR premises;
   his account was that the police indicated that copies  of  the  documents
   would suffice, and that he would be contacted again with a date to  bring
   them in to the Tirana police station.  Mr Marku stated that  neither  he,
   nor the CNR, had yet been charged  with  any  offence.   He  asserted  at
   paragraph 5 of his statement that:

      '5. ...any claim that either myself  or  the  CNR  have  acted  in  an
      unlawful manner is unfounded and simply wrong.   I  can  also  confirm
      that if any charge or charges were ever to be brought  against  myself
      or the CNR  that  we  had  acted  unlawfully  in  providing  documents
      relating to blood feuds both I and the Committee would fight any  such
      charge vigorously until vindicated.'

74. Mr Collins also provided the  following  online  press  report  dated  5
   December  2011,  by  Besar  Likmeta  reporting  from  Tirana  in  'Balkan
   Insight':


      "Albanians Charged Over Fake Asylum Claims


      Police pressed charges on Friday against two NGO officials accused  of
      selling fake documents about deadly  vendettas  to  Albanians  seeking
      asylum in Western Europe.

      Gjin Marku, head of Albania's National Reconciliation  Committee,  and
      Pashko  Popaj,  are  charged  with  selling  would-be  asylum  seekers
      documents to back up their claims. The papers asserted that they  were
      victims of dead blood feuds in Albania.  "The documents have no  legal
      basis and the citizens that received them are not  involved  in  blood
      feuds," police spokeswoman Laura Totraku said in  a  statement.  Marku
      and Popaj were not reachable for a comment on Friday.

      An investigation by Balkan Insight in October, found that several NGOs
      were involved in the scheme,  selling  fake  documents  claiming  that
      feuds with other families  put  potential  migrant's  lives  at  risk.
      According to Fredy Rosemont, head of Belgium's  Asylum  and  Migration
      Department, who recently visited Tirana, none of  the  applicants  met
      the conditions for asylum under the Geneva Convention.

      "We are convinced that the Albanians who have arrived in  Belgium  did
      not  come  here  spontaneously,"  Rosemont  said  in  a  joint   press
      conference in Tirana last week. "Behind these people that are  falling
      prey to lies  is  an  entire  organisation  -  networks  that  provide
      documents and fake papers in exchange for huge amounts of  money,"  he
      added.

      Visa-free travel to the EU took effect for  Albania  on  December  15,
      2010, allowing Albanian citizens  to  travel  to  Europe's  borderless
      Schengen zone.  Before the visa liberalization process there were  few
      applications for asylum from Albanians in the EU and the recent  spike
      in applications has become a matter of  concern  for  the  authorities
      there."

75. After contacting the British Embassy in Tirana, Ms  Gough  responded  by
   letter of 23 January 2012.  There had been no official response from  the
   Albanian government but she did have available a number of extracts  from
   emails, which had been sent to her in one composite email.  The  sender's
   name for the summary email has been redacted.  The  summary  email  on  5
   January 2012 said this:

      "Sorry for not responding sooner.  The latest we have from post:

      "Please find the following details of the persons and non-governmental
      organisations involved in  providing  certificates  to  support  false
      blood feud asylum claims in Belgium:

      . Gjin Marku, 55 years old, Chairman of the Committee  of  Nationwide
        Reconciliation  [address  and  telephone  numbers  given]  Website:
        www.pajtimi.com, www.reconciliation-al.com

      . Pashko Popaj, member of the Association of the  Peace  Missionaries
        and Blood Feud  Reconciliations  of  Albania,  resident  in  Bajze,
        Malesi e Madhe, Albania

      . Faz Shabal, Mayor of Koplik, 62 years old

      . Ramadan Likaj, Chairman of Postribe commune, 45 years old.

      The above persons are  all  currently  under  investigation  from  the
      Prosecution Office for issuing false documents."


      "...would like to clarify that the document in itself  is  not  forged
      but it contains false information.  The  persons  under  investigation
      for issuing these documents have really  issued,  signed  and  stamped
      these  documents  (with  genuine  stamps  and  signatures)   but   the
      information they have provided is not genuine as most  of  the  asylum
      claimants were not really in a blood feud."


      "...to obtain a copy of this document is really difficult as the  case
      is  under  investigation  and   the   persons   involved   are   under
      prosecution."

      This information just in the form of  emails.   I  am  not  sure  what
      further information can  be  obtained  at  this  stage  or  indeed  is
      available but will approach post."       [Emphasis added]

76. Ms Gough relied on three further documents:  the Balkan Insight  report,
   an informally translated document from  the  website  www.shqiptarja.com,
   and an article on the Albanian Screen TV website dated  2  December  2011
   entitled, 'Investigation begins, giving false proof for asylum':

      "Tirana - Investigations for the head of  the  County  Committee  of
      Reconciliation, Gjin  Marku and Pashko Popaj, missionary in Malesia  e
      Madhe. Police suspect that they  are  responsible  for  issuing  false
      certificates for different citizens, being used for  asylum  purposes.
      Investigations showed that they have  used  their  position  and  have
      issued falsified certificates that  benefit  these  citizens  unfairly
      asylum in different European countries.  Forged  certificates  and  no
      legal basis to persons who are not represented  to  be  in  enmity  or
      vengeance. This phenomenon raises the concern a  few  weeks  ago,  the
      Belgian authorities, who also recorded the highest number of  Albanian
      citizens,  who  sought  asylum  for  revenge,  who  then  returned  to
      Albania."

77.  The  article  in  Shqiptarja  newspaper  appeared   on   its   website,
   www.shqiptarja.com, on 2 December 2011:

      "Asylum seekers in the EU, the head of the Blood  feud  Reconciliation
      Organisation is put under investigation.

      The Department of the Fight against Financial  Crime  has  started  an
      investigation against the Tirana based  chairman  of  the  Blood  feud
      Reconciliation Organisation, Gjin Marku and the  Shkodra-based  member
      of the Peace Missionaries Organisation, Tom Popaj.

      It is suspected the above persons have  issued  fake  certificates  to
      various individuals in order to enable them to claim  asylum  unjustly
      in various EU countries. He is  charged  with  "Document  Forgery"  as
      provided by article 186 of the Penal Code.

      The State Police will follow with  the  verification  of  all  similar
      cases."

78. The investigation of Mr Marku is  continuing  but  we  have  no  further
   details about it.

                    Other documents and country materials


Appellant's individual documents

1. Articles with translations from both Shqiptarja and  Shekulli  newspapers
   are provided.  The article in  Shekulli,  dated  Friday  20  April  2007,
   speaks of  the  appellant's  father  attacking  a  'buildings  protection
   policeman' (a security guard), and the guard shooting  back  five  times.
   The appellant's father is described as 40 years old.   In the  middle  of
   Thursday 19 April 2007, there was an  argument  between  the  appellant's
   father and the 'buildings policeman', who had overtaken  the  appellant's
   father in his car.  The appellant's father went home to get  his  pistol,
   then drove around town looking for the 'buildings policeman' and when  he
   found him, shot at him, breaking the glass on the policeman's  car.   The
   guard  pulled  out  his  service  pistol  and  shot  back,  killing   the
   appellant's father.  He then informed his colleagues and required them to
   arrest him.  An investigation had been opened, by Has Public Prosecutor's
   Office and the Police Interior Service Control.

2. The victim's family had not indicated  whether  they  would  revenge  the
   killing.  The policeman had an unblemished professional  record,  whereas
   the appellant's father was a  'problematic  person'  who,  several  years
   earlier,  had  'wonderfully  survived  an  armed   attentat'.      Police
   protection was being provided for the killer's family:  other police  had
   been to the scene and seized both pistols, and the  police  vehicle  with
   windows shattered by a bullet.  Witnesses had  been  interviewed  at  the
   time.

3. The next day, on 21 April 2007, the Public Prosecutor's  Office  rejected
   a claim by the policeman that he killed in self-defence, since 'they  had
   old conflicts between each other'.   The  policeman  risked  10-20  years
   imprisonment.  There had been a quarrel a few days earlier which resulted
   in hand-to-hand fighting between the two men:

      "...On the meantime confidential sources for Shqiptarja newspaper said
      that these two persons who shot each other two day ago in one  of  the
      main streets of Krume have had other conflicts before this time.

      According to a resident of Krume who knew both persons involved on the
      exchange of fire, the policeman and the victim have had a quarrel  few
      days ago, where they had hand-to-hand fighting.  While the reasons  of
      the conflict between  the  building's  protection  policeman  and  the
      resident  of  [the  appellant's  village'  are  unclear,  the   Public
      Prosecutor's Office has signed the arrest of [the policeman],  keeping
      him at the custody until the end of the investigation.  There will  be
      no requirement for arrest warrant from the court as the policeman  has
      already been arrested in flagrant circumstances.  In  any  event,  the
      local police are anxious of a new blood feud that may occur during the
      following days."

4. A Certificate from the Village Elders dated  2  December  2008  certified
   that the appellant was at risk:

      "With this document we certify that [the appellant] is in a blood feud
      because his father [name] was killed.  His stay in Albania could cause
      his death because of this blood feud.  We issue this certificate as  a
      document."

5. Family records  evidence  the  appellant's  membership  of  his  father's
   family.  A certificate from Antonia Young authenticates the  certificates
   as bearing the correct stamps, notations, and in three cases,  watermarks
   and holograms, in line with the 1974 Albanian state requirements and  the
   updated requirement arising from a  ministerial  ruling  of  11  December
   2003, which came into force on 1 April 2004.

A.    European Commission opinion on Albania's  application  for  membership
of the EU (9 November 2010)

6. The European Commission considered  that  Albania's  legal  framework  on
   human rights  and  respect  for  and  protection  of  minorities  broadly
   corresponded to European standards  but  that  there  remained   concerns
   about the transparency of the media, corruption, which was  endemic,  and
   respect for and protection of minorities.

B.    US State Department Reports

7. The 2010 human rights report prepared by the US State  Department  Report
   remains the most up-to-date.  The report stated that:

      "During the year there were continuing reports of  societal  killings,
      including both generational "blood feud" and  revenge  killings.  Such
      killings sometimes involved criminal gangs. According to the  Interior
      Ministry, there were five blood feud-related killings during the year.
      However, NGOs reported 55 blood feud-related killings during the year.
      According to NGOs, fear of blood feud reprisals effectively imprisoned
      approximately 1,490 families their homes. The Court of Serious  Crimes
      tried blood feud cases. The law  punishes  premeditated  murder,  when
      committed for revenge  or  a  blood  feud,  with  20  years'  or  life
      imprisonment."

8. There was no other reference to blood feuds in the report.

C.    BBC News Country Profile: Albania

9. The version of this document in the bundle was downloaded  on  11  August
   2011.  The Republic of Albania has a tiny population, just  3.2  million.
   It became a Stalinist state after World War II and remained so until  its
   transition to democracy in 1990,  followed  by  democratic  elections  in
   1992.   In 1999, it  absorbed  nearly  half  a  million  Kosovo  Albanian
   refugees from the Kosovo conflict; many Albanians have  left  Albania  in
   search of work and  their  remittances  are  an  important  part  of  the
   country's economy. There is no mention of the Kanun or of blood feuds.

10. Key Documents Albania (23 November 2009)  This source draws  heavily  on
   the Canadian IRB and US State Department Report reports,  which  will  be
   considered separately.

11. Operational Guidance Note (July 2010).  At paragraph  3.6  the  Guidance
   Note set out the blood  feud  information  available.   Some  feuds  were
   carried out  by  paid  assassins.   Government  efforts  had  focused  on
   prevention rather than assistance to affected families.  There  had  been
   an increase in investigations,  according  to  the  Albanian  government,
   resulting in reduction of the number of blood feud murders to two (out of
   96 murders nationally overall) in 2007.

12. At paragraph 3.6.8, the Guidance note states that there was no  evidence
   to indicate that legal mechanisms set up to deal with blood  feuds  could
   not provide effective  protection.   Whether  internal  relocation  would
   assist depended on the commitment of  those  attempting  to  enforce  the
   feud.  The conclusion, at paragraph 3.6.11, was that:

      "3.6.11 Conclusion. In general, the Albanian Government  is  able  and
      willing to offer effective protection for its  citizens  who  are  the
      victims of a blood feud; however, there may be individual cases  where
      the level of protection offered is,  in  practice,  insufficient.  The
      level of protection should be assessed on a case by case basis  taking
      into account what  the  claimant  did  to  seek  protection  and  what
      response was received. Internal relocation may be appropriate in  some
      cases.

      3.6.12 The UNHCR consider that there  may  be  some  individuals  who,
      because of the circumstances of their case, may be considered to be  a
      PSG. However,  we  consider  that  the  findings  in  Skenderaj  taken
      together with SB Moldova suggest that families affected by blood feuds
      in Albania are not perceived as being  different  by  the  surrounding
      society and would not form a PSG. The majority of claimants from  this
      category of claim will not, therefore, qualify for either a  grant  of
      asylum or Humanitarian Protection and where there is a strong internal
      relocation argument supported by a previous successful relocation some
      claims may be certifiable,  though  most  cases  are  unlikely  to  be
      clearly unfounded."

     The papers summarise materials present elsewhere but  do  not  seek  to
   draw  conclusions  therefrom.   They  are  therefore  of  no   particular
   assistance to us since the materials mentioned are already before us.

F.    Canadian IRB Materials

14. The bundle contains a number of research  documents  from  the  Canadian
   IRB, analysing the position on blood feuds in Albania.  It is clear  that
   the IRB has researched in depth the position on blood feuds and the  non-
   governmental organisations which purport to mediate in  this  area.   The
   historical responses were as follows:

   (a)      Response AKB24544 (7 April 2004) examines whether  a  widow  can
   marry outside her dead husband's family, if she has a child with him, and
   whether that would be cause for a blood feud.  It sets out  the  relevant
   provisions of the Kanun.

   (b)      Response ALB42520 (17 May 2004) examines the consequences  to  a
   family of failure to  retaliate  against  another  family  when  the  two
   families are in a blood feud.  It is somewhat sparse:

        "Information on blood feuds, including consequences of  a  family's
        failure to retaliate for the murder of a family member when the two
        families are in  a  blood  feud,  and  whether  the  abovementioned
        situations could trigger a blood feud...could not  be  found  among
        the  sources  consulted  by  the  Research  Directorate.   However,
        section 873 of the Kanun of Lek� Dukagjinit (KLD), the most widely-
        known source of customary law in Albania (Shkoder.net n.d.) may  be
        relevant and provides that "[if]  one  of  the  victim's  relatives
        kills the murderer after 24 hours have passed, that  person  is  no
        longer avenging blood,  but  is  incurring  blood  (Kanuni  I  Lek�
        Dukagjinit (KLD) 1989)."

   (c)      Response ALB43503 (25 April 2005) concerns the position  of  the
   CNR and has been largely overtaken by  more  recent  responses.  Response
   ALB43020 dated 3 November 2004 is an earlier version of the consideration
   of the workings of reconciliation  groups  and  the  existence  of  state
   protection. Response ALB42821 of 20 July 2004 covers similar ground.

   (d)      Response ALB101471 (22 September 2006) concerns  the  protection
   measures in place  from  2005-2006  and  is  of  no  real  assistance  in
   assessing protection in 2012.   The same is true of the consideration  of
   internal relocation in Response ALB101479 on 13  September  2006  and  of
   AL43501 of 26 April 2005, which  lists  the  leaders  and  names  of  the
   organisations working in the area of  blood  feud  reconciliation,  drawn
   from the CNR website.  The Response notes that the CNR website 'indicates
   that each case of blood feud reconciliation is followed with the help  of
   archived folders, although it does not specify the content,  purpose,  or
   length of time for which such records are maintained.

   (e)      Response ALB103193 (22 October 2009) dealt with the  attestation
   letters,  issuing  organisations,  and  how  the  letters  were   issued,
   processed and stored.  It was based on in-country evidence from the  CNR,
   and a research view from a Tel Aviv  based  academic  with  expertise  in
   blood feuds.  The Canadian embassy had supported the CNR's view  that  it
   was the only NGO authorised to issue such letters, but a police  official
   stated that while the CNR might have 'some information on [self-confined]
   families' only state authorities could issue such attestations.


   (f)      Response ALB103570 ( 8 October 2010) examined again the means by
   which reconciliation groups begin working on a case; records kept by such
   groups to document their work; and the steps normally taken by groups  to
   resolve blood feuds, by reference to the  work  of  an  unnamed  research
   fellow  at  St  Chad's,  Durham,  and  other  researchers  at  Roehampton
   University  and  Colgate  University,  indicates  that  post-1992,   non-
   governmental organisations did keep records' and that the CNR and caritas
   were 'systematic' and 'competent' in their record-keeping.   Before  1992
   the records were mainly oral recollections. The number of  feuds  handled
   is significantly higher for the CNR as opposed to the AFCR.   The  report
   expressed concerns from some sources that certain  reconciliation  groups
   had been established to  take  advantage  of  available  national  and/or
   international NGO funding; that endemic corruption persisted  in  Albania
   and that it was impossible to rule out the possibility  that  attestation
   letters were being bought and sold, independent of any actual blood feud.
     The CNR chairman, Mr Marku,  had  stated  that  it  was  impossible  to
   purchase a CNR attestation  letter  because  each  had  an  unique  code,
   protocol number, and his personal signature. The new  national  mediation
   law had not been fully implemented and the Research Fellow at  St  Chad's
   considered it was unlikely to  improve  the  chances  of  reconciliation,
   since both parties still had to be willing.


   (g)      Response ALB103573  (covering the  period  2007-September  2010)
   examines  state  protection  and  support  services  available  to  those
   affected  by  blood  feuds,  including  whether  individuals  have   been
   prosecuted for blood-feud-related crimes.  It records the vast difference
   between the figures of the Albanian government and  the  non-governmental
   organisations as to the extent of blood feuds in modern Albania, and  the
   opinion of Professor Philip Alston that the correct figures  were  nearer
   the very low government levels.  The European Commission did not consider
   that Albania had a coordinated strategy.  A specialist on Albanian  blood
   feuds at St Chad's College Durham had given as his opinion that  criminal
   proceedings were not regarded by the aggrieved party as a resolution to a
   feud.  The Albanian police often did not get involved  until  a  criminal
   had taken place, because of potential danger  to  the  police  and  their
   families.  Educational assistance  was  being  provided  in  the  Shkodra
   school district up to grade 9; a boarding  school  for  the  children  of
   families  in  self-confinement  had  been  closed  due  to  discovery  of
   mismanagement of its funds.   The unlicensed NGO which had  operated  the
   school had misappropriated the funds and  the  children  were  reportedly
   malnourished.



15. In Response ALB103902 (1 February 2012), the CIRB considered the  latest
   information for Albania regarding attestation letters  for  blood  feuds;
   issuing organizations; how letters  are  issued,  processed  and  stored;
   whether issuing organizations are recognized by the  government;  whether
   the CNR has the full authority, approved by the government and recognized
   by  international  organizations  and   institutions,   to   verify   the
   authenticity of blood feuds; fees for  mediation  services;  issuance  of
   false  attestation  letters.   The  Albanian  government  had  issued   a
   clarificatory statement of its position in the wake of the arrests of  Mr
   Marku and others:

      "In a statement prepared by the Albanian Ministry of Interior for  the
      Research Directorate, an official indicated that some non-governmental
      organizations  (NGOs)  in  Albania  have   issued   certificates   [or
      attestation letters] to people involved  in  blood  feuds,  but  these
      organizations do not have any "legal right" to issue such certificates
      (Albania 4 Jan. 2012). Similarly, in correspondence with the  Research
      Directorate, the Executive Director of  the  Albanian  Foundation  for
      Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation of Disputes (AFCR), an Albanian
      NGO established in 1995 for the purpose of conflict resolution and the
      promotion of tolerance and understanding, stated that some  NGOs  have
      issued attestation letters about blood feuds, but  that  they  do  not
      have any official authority to act in  this  capacity  (AFCR  16  Dec.
      2011).

      The official of the Albanian Ministry of Interior indicated  that  the
      police, prosecution office, and the courts are the state  institutions
      that handle blood feud problems, and that the courts  and  prosecution
      office are the only agencies authorized by  the  government  to  issue
      certificates related to blood feuds (Albania  4  Jan.  2012).  Without
      providing details, the official indicated that these certificates  can
      be issued after authorities "evaluate whether a case requires  further
      legal protection or  not"  (ibid.).  In  contrast  to  the  official's
      statement, two NGOs active in blood-feud mediation indicated that,  to
      their  knowledge,  there  are  no  governmental  agencies  that  issue
      attestation letters about blood feuds (AFCR 16 Dec. 2011; CNR 25  Nov.
      2011). Further information about the issuance, processing and  storage
      of these certificates by the courts and prosecution office  could  not
      be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate.

      Regarding the role of NGOs in mediating blood feuds, the  Ministry  of
      Interior official explained that NGOs operate in accordance  with  the
      Constitution and the 1999 Law on Mediation (Albania 4 Jan. 2012).  The
      official   specifically   listed   the   Committee    of    Nationwide
      Reconciliation (CNR), the Mission of Feuds Reconciliation, the  League
      of Missionaries of Peace, the AFCR and  the  Center  for  Justice  and
      Peace  as  organizations  active  in  blood  feud  mediation  (ibid.).
      However, in response to a question about whether any NGOs are approved
      by the government to verify the authenticity of blood feuds, he  noted
      that NGOs "do  not  duplicate  the  powers  of  the  [Court]  and  the
      [Prosecution Office] (ibid.)."

16. On behalf of the CNR, Mr Marku had continued to assert that it  was  the
   "only  organization  recognized  by  the  government  and  it  has   full
   authority, approved by the government to verify blood feuds and issue the
   attestation letters" (CNR 29 Nov. 2011).  In relation to  the  processing
   of blood feuds and attestation letters, he stated that:

      "... The attestation letters are issued only after the verification of
      a blood feud and confirmation that it would be difficult to reconcile.
      The attestation letters are signed only by the chairman  of  the  CNR,
      Mr. Gjin Marku. No one else is authorized to  sign  letters.  The  CNR
      creates a file for a particular blood feud, which includes a  copy  of
      the letter. The file may contain information  on  the  situation  that
      caused the blood feud, contact details of individuals involved in  the
      blood feud and notes on reconciliation attempts.  All  the  files  are
      stored in accordance with the Albanian Data  Protection  Act,  in  the
      main office of the CNR in Tirana (CNR 30 Nov. 2011)."

17. Under the heading, 'Purchase of false  attestation  letters',  the  CIRB
   set out the most complete analysis of the difficulties presented  by  the
   NGOs in Albania thus far.  The research  response  indicates  significant
   concerns in this area:

      "4. Purchase of False Attestation Letters

      Various sources report that some  NGOs  have  issued  false  documents
      about blood feuds (Albania 2 Dec. 2011; AFCR 16 Dec. 2011; Belgium  29
      Nov. 2011, 4-8; Balkan Insight  5  Dec.  2011;  ibid.  27  Oct.  2011;
      Kohajone.com n.d). In response to an increase  in  blood-feud  related
      asylum claims in Belgium in September and October of 2011, the head of
      Belgium's Asylum and  Migration  Department  reportedly  claimed  that
      behind the individual  asylum  seekers  "is  an  entire  organisation,
      networks that provide documents and fake papers in exchange  for  huge
      amounts of money" (qtd. in AFP 18 Oct. 2011). According to the  Balkan
      Investigative Reporting  Network's  publication  Balkan  Insight,  the
      Belgian official met with Albanian  authorities  to  warn  them  about
      possible criminal networks (27 Oct. 2011).

      Balkan Insight found that some NGOs that claim to work for blood  feud
      reconciliation "routinely sell  families  documents  and  certificates
      saying they could become victims of a fatal vendetta if  they  do  not
      receive asylum ...," even in cases in which no feud or  murder  exists
      (Balkan Insight 27 Oct.  2011).  The  reporter,  who  went  undercover
      looking to buy a false attestation letter about involvement in a blood
      feud, was initially offered a certificate by Fran Nikolli, the general
      secretary of Mother Teresa's Missionaries for  Peace,  who  created  a
      fictitious story about a family targeting the journalist  for  revenge
      after an uncle, who was alleged to be  a  migrant  worker  in  Greece,
      fatally shot a family member in response to a  car  accident  (ibid.).
      Nikolli offered to sell such a certificate to the journalist  for  250
      Euros ..., while he claimed that, if the story had  been  "real,"  the
      price would have been 150 Euros ... (Balkan  Insight  27  Oct.  2011).
      Moreover,  Nikolli   said   that   his   organization   had   released
      approximately 220 similar certificates in August and September of 2011
      (ibid.). However, according to the reporter,  Nikolli  backed  out  of
      issuing the certificate after the Albanian police began  investigating
      his organization (ibid.). Gjin  Mekshi,  chair  of  the  Shkodra-based
      "Nationwide Reconciliation Mission, 'Mother Teresa'," also offered  to
      sell the journalist a  similar  document  about  the  same  "imaginary
      crime" for 200 Euros ... (Balkan Insight 27 Oct. 2011).

      Further, sources indicate that two local officials, the  head  of  the
      town of Postriba and the mayor of Koplik, were  indicted  for  issuing
      fake certificates about blood feuds  (Balkan  Insight  27  Oct.  2011;
      Balkan Web 24 Oct. 2011). A police  representative  reportedly  stated
      that the officials "had no legal framework  on  which  to  issue  such
      documents and in most cases they are fakes,  because  the  people  who
      received them were not involved in any conflict or  vendetta"  (Balkan
      Insight 27 Oct. 2011).

      A report by the Office of the Commissioner General  for  Refugees  and
      Stateless Persons (Commissariat g�n�ral aux r�fugi�s et aux apatrides)
      in Belgium cites information from the Albanian State Police report  to
      the effect that the Association of Peace  Reconciliation  Missionaries
      of Albania had also issued fraudulent attestation  letters  to  people
      who were not involved in any blood feuds (Belgium 29 Nov. 2011, 7).

      The Albanian news agency KojaJone.com, Balkan Insight and the Albanian
      State Police report on police investigations into  the  activities  of
      Gjin Marku, the chairman of the CNR, and Pashko Popaj, a member of the
      Association of Missionaries  of  Peace  and  Reconciliation  of  Blood
      Feuds, in issuing false documents about blood feuds  (Albania  2  Dec.
      2011; Balkan Insight 5 Dec. 2011; KojaJone.com n.d.).

      The Executive Director of AFCR stated that the  CNR  also  has  issued
      false attestation letters and that state  authorities  have  initiated
      penal proceedings  against  the  organization  (AFCR  16  Dec.  2011).
      According to the KojaJone.com,

           [translation]
           [The]  State  Police  declared  that  the  two  individuals  are
           suspected of using their  official  positions  to  issue  forged
           certificates to different people with the aim  of  applying  and
           obtaining unfair  asylum  in  some  countries  of  Europe,  thus
           committing the offense of  falsification  of  documents.  Police
           sources said that according to verifications and the information
           gathered by the Financial Crime Directorate at the Department of
           Organized and Serious Crimes of the State Police in  cooperation
           with police counterparts showed that 55 year-old Gjin Marku, and
           Pashko Popaj issued forged certificates without legal  basis  to
           some citizens who do not appear to be in  enmity  or  vengeance.
           Citizens were issued certificates in order  to  seek  asylum  in
           Belgium. ... Following investigations conducted  by  police,  it
           was discovered that  Mr.  Marku  and  Mr.  Popaj  issued  forged
           certificates by making use of their  official  positions.  Thus,
           the police  sent  materials  against  both  individuals  to  the
           prosecutor for further investigation. (KojaJone.com n.d.)

      Similarly, the Albanian state-police press release indicates that  the
      Financial Crime Directorate at the Department of Organized and Serious
      Crime of the State Police provided materials to the Prosecution Office
      against Gjin Marku and  Pashko  Popaj  (Albania  2  Dec.  2011).  Both
      individuals were reportedly suspected

           [translation]
           "of  using  their  official  position  ...   to   issue   forged
           certificates to different people with the aim  of  applying  and
           obtaining unfair  asylum  in  some  countries  of  Europe,  thus
           committing the offense of  forgery  of  documents  according  to
           article 186 of the Penal Code" (ibid.).

      According to the Criminal Code, the punishment for  issuing  falsified
      documents in an official capacity is  imprisonment  for  up  to  seven
      years and a fine ranging from 200,000 lek [1881.06  CAD  (XE  17  Jan.
      2012a)] to two million lek [18793.44 CAD (XE 17 Jan. 2012b)]  (Albania
      2004, Art. 186).

      In addition, the Office of the Commissioner General for  Refugees  and
      Stateless Persons in Belgium, in a report about falsified documents in
      Albania, notes that  the  Albanian  television  program  "Fiks  Fare,"
      during a 27 October 2011 presentation, showed  the  president  of  the
      Peace Missionaries Union Albania, Pashko Toma, while being filmed with
      a hidden camera, accepting money for signing and stamping  a  document
      that was written by an  "'undercover'"  journalist  (Belgium  29  Nov.
      2011, 6). The president "explained to the journalist  that  he  issues
      similar attestation letters to Albanians from all over the country and
      that his secretary knows what to do when she  writes  these  kinds  of
      documents" (ibid.).

      The same television program showed Gjin Marku, also being filmed  with
      a hidden camera, accepting 300 Euros ... in exchange for the  issuance
      of an attestation letter and the creation of a "vendetta" file  for  a
      woman he met for the first time (Belgium 29 Nov. 2011,  6).  According
      to the report,

           [Translation]

           [She] said that the documents were to be used by her brother  to
           seek asylum in Great Britain. The documents were written without
           the Committee of Nationwide Reconciliation verifying  the  facts
           or acting as a mediator in this case. ... Gjin  Marku  explained
           to the woman that her brother must say during a hearing that  he
           has proof that he is still in danger. ...  The  woman  explained
           that actually the family [was] not  involved  in  any  vendetta,
           [but] Gjin Marku told her not to worry about it.... (ibid.)

      However, in correspondence with the Research Directorate, the Chairman
      of the CNR denied the allegations, claiming that they were part  of  a
      "political setup" (9 Jan.  2012).  Regarding  the  incident  with  the
      hidden camera, in a statement by the CNR, which was signed by the Vice-
      chairman of the CNR, the Chairman of  the  National  Assembly  of  the
      Reconciliation Missionaries and the Secretary and Vice-chairman of the
      Assembly, and which the Chairman of the CNR provided to  the  Research
      Directorate, the authors maintain that the money was  charged  by  the
      CNR to "cover logistics cost" and the certificate was issued based  on
      the urgency of the case and the  lack  of  time  for  verification  in
      accordance with the CNR regulations (CNR  9  Jan.  2012).  In  earlier
      correspondence to the Research Directorate, the Chairman claimed  that
      CNR representatives do not receive any money for their  reconciliation
      efforts from families in blood feuds, but that families sometimes  pay
      their travel expenses or accommodations (ibid. 4 Dec. 2011).

      Regarding falsified documents, in 22 November 2011  correspondence  to
      the Research Directorate, the Chairman of the CNR  warned  that  there
      have been several cases in which his signature  has  been  forged  and
      that he has advised international agencies to verify the  authenticity
      of attestation letters directly with the CNR (ibid. 22 Nov. 2011).

      The CNR claims that  there  are  about  83  so-called  "reconciliation
      associations" such as  [the]  League  of  Missionaries  of  Peace  and
      National Reconciliation, Mother Teresa Mission of Reconciliation,  The
      Institute of Justice and National Reconciliation, House of Justice and
      Peace, House of Reconciliation and Peace, etc." (ibid. Oct. 2011, 33).
      According to the CNR, some of those organizations  have  issued  false
      attestation letters (ibid.).

      The Albanian Ministry of Interior has reportedly  established  a  task
      force to address the problem  of  counterfeit  documents  about  blood
      feuds used by asylum seekers (Sot.com 19 Dec. 2011). Both the Albanian
      police director (AFP 18 Oct. 2011; Belgium 29 Nov. 2011,  4)  and  the
      Minister of Interior (Sot.com 19 Dec. 2011) have  vowed  to  prosecute
      those who prepare such counterfeit documents (ibid.).

      According to the report of the Office of the Commissioner General  for
      Refugees and Stateless Persons in Belgium,

           [Translation] "Considering  ...  the  extent  of  corruption  in
           Albania, it  is  impossible  to  be  sure  about  the  level  of
           corruption of  certain  organizations.  As  a  consequence,  the
           attempt of examining the authenticity of an  attestation  letter
           can not be conclusive" (Belgium 29 Nov. 2011, 5).

      The report also notes that although  some  organizations  have  issued
      fake attestation letters,

           [Translation] "it does not mean  that  all  attestation  letters
           issued  by  those  organizations  contain   false   information"
           (ibid.)."                        [Emphasis added]


G.    Australian Government Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) Country advice:
Albania

18. This records dramatically  reducing  statistics  for  all  homicides  in
   Albania from 1999 (458) to 2007 (87).  In relation to  blood  feuds,  the
   Advice says this:

      "2008 article in The New York Times stated that an  estimated  "20,000
      people have been ensnared by blood feuds since they  resurfaced  after
      the collapse of Communism in 1991, with 9,500 people killed and nearly
      1,000 children deprived of schooling because they are locked indoors."
      The killing of a son is apparently a common form of revenge  in  blood
      feuds. Fortunately, blood  feud  related  deaths  also  appear  to  be
      declining in line with the reduction in  the  overall  homicide  rate.
      According to the Interior Ministry, there were four blood feud related
      killings, out of a total of 85 murders during 2008, the lowest  number
      in 18 years. In 2009 the Interior Ministry only reported one.  The  US
      Department of State (USDOS) attributes this, at least in part, to  the
      criminalisation of blood feuds in the criminal code in  2007  and  the
      subsequent codification of a three-year  sentence.  It  reported  that
      "the Court of Serious Crimes tried blood feud cases" and that the "law
      punishes premeditated murder, when committed for revenge  or  a  blood
      feud, with 20 years' or life imprisonment.""

19. The Advice considers the effectiveness of state protection  and  whether
   prosecutions   actually   occur.    Although   applauding   the   ongoing
   professionalisation of the police force and 'their increasing ability  to
   maintain law and  order  in  a  state  until  recently  characterised  by
   lawlessness."   Measures  were  being  adopted  to  improve  inter-agency
   cooperation between the police, the prosecutors and the judiciary.

H.    CNR materials

20. On 16 April 2010, the  CNR  responded  to  what  was  then  a  draft  of
   Professor Philip Alston's report to the UN  Security  Council  concerning
   blood feuds in Albania.   Mr  Marku,  who  wrote  the  letter,  disagreed
   vigorously with Professor Alston's assessment  of  the  number  of  blood
   feuds and victims and argued strongly for his own, wider definition.   He
   repeated that many killings nowadays  did  not  fit  the  Kanun  and,  in
   particular, that  many  Albanians  confused  honour  killing  with  blood
   taking.  He contended that  the  Albanian  government  was  not  able  to
   provide adequate protection and should not claim responsibility  for  the
   drop (which he did not accept) in murders linked to blood feuds,  ancient
   or new.

I.    Other materials

21. Reports dated 14 February and 10 July 2008 in the  New  York  Times  are
   summarised by HJT Research News Reporting Service.  The  full  report  in
   each case would have been more helpful than a summary by a  third  party.
   They provide anecdotal evidence of self-confinement,  and  commentary  on
   the requirements of Kanun law.    The same is true of an article from The
   World dated 3 June 2007, summarising a particular incident and case.

22. On 26 October 2010, the Southeast European Times  reported  the  killing
   of a mayor at his home in Kuk�s the previous day.  A number of people had
   been interrogated but the perpetrators and motive remained unclear.

23. On 11 August 2011, the Telegraph newspaper reported a  blood  feud,  and
   the intervention of Mr Marku and the CNR therein.  Mr Marku, the grandson
   of a mediator, whose wife was herself  involved  in  a  blood  feud,  had
   emphasised that  the  difficulty  these  days  concerned  people  failing
   properly to follow Kanun law.  The article discussed  the  casting  of  a
   film about a family in the middle of a blood feud.  The  lead  actor  was
   himself a member of such a family:

      "...Refet Abazi, the professional actor who plays the father, is in no
      doubt about the sorrow that blood feuds  cause.  ...In  1997  his  own
      brother was murdered, and when the chief suspect was arrested and then
      released without charge, the family came under 'terrible pressure'  to
      take revenge.  Eventually, though, they resolved the situation another
      way - one that was arguably much harder, and which required a patience
      that has not traditionally come easily in this part of the world.  'My
      father decided we could not take the law into our  own  hands,'  Abazi
      says.  'He said that if justice could not be delivered  by  ourselves,
      or by the state, God would deliver it instead.'  So they simply turned
      the other cheek."

   There had been no killings on either side since the original 1997 murder.



24. In an article from the newspaper,  The  World,  entitled  'The  Haunting
   Persistence of Albanian Blood Feuds', reporting an interview with  a  CNR
   mediator Pashk Lleshi, Lleshi stated  that  the  Kanun  does  not  permit
   killing of a woman or a child, for a piece of land or  for  an  offensive
   word, but that it is often misused  to  justify  all  kinds  of  criminal
   revenge, in this case, the shooting of two innocent bystanders  in  1997.
   The  injured  family  are  involved  in  conciliation  over  coffee   and
   cigarettes.  There have been no killings in the 13 years  that  followed.
   One of the dead men's brothers is currently unwilling  to  reconcile  but
   the article ends on a hopeful note that  reconciliation  may  be  brought
   about soon.

25. An essay by Erwin Koch entitled 'But it was beautiful' reflects the  lax
   use of Kanun to justify murder. Again, it states that the blood taker may
   not kill the children of the  blood  giver,  his  wife,  his  house,  his
   courtyard, or his livestock.  It records  that  the  CNR  considers  that
   there have been 10,000 families embroiled in blood feuds in the  last  20
   years, 1480 of whom seldom leave their homes, and  that  2000  people  in
   that situation  over  the  last  decade  committed  suicide.   Government
   figures on the other hand have blood feud killings down from  45  to  one
   case in 2009 and  only  130  self-confined  families  nationally.     The
   author is a Swiss journalist.
