Representation:
For the Appellants:    No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of India, born respectively on 5  May  1985
    and 3 April 1985.  The first appellant applied for leave to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  and  the  second
    appellant as her husband.  On 3 January  2014  the  respondent  refused
    their applications.  They subsequently appealed and in a decision dated
    15 July 2013, having considered the appeals on  papers,  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Duff dismissed their appeals.

 2. The refusal letter relating to the first appellant stated that she  had
    made her application and had claimed 10 points for Maintenance  (Funds)
    under Appendix C of the Immigration Rules but that the  documents  that
    had been provided were dated more than one month before the application
    and therefore the respondent was not satisfied that the first appellant
    met the requirements to be awarded 10  points  under  Appendix  C.   It
    followed that she did not satisfy the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules and therefore her application was refused.

 3. The refusal letter went on to set out in a table that as the  appellant
    was studying outside of Inner London she needed to show  that  she  had
    the required funds to cover the fees for the entire course, as  it  was
    less than a year long, had the required funds of �1,800 per  month  for
    two months for herself and the required funds of �450 per month for two
    months for her dependent partner.  She would  therefore  have  to  have
    �2,500 plus any outstanding course fees.  She had paid  �2,000  of  the
    total course fees of �2,500.  She was therefore required to  show  that
    she has �3,000 for a consecutive 28 day period to meet the requirements
    for Maintenance (Funds).  The application had been made on 27  December
    2012 but the closing date of the bank statements submitted  in  support
    of the application was 21 November 2012, which was more than one  month
    prior to the occasion and, as such, that document could  not  be  taken
    into account.  It was also found that the bank statement was not in the
    name of the first appellant but of the second  appellant  and  that  no
    evidence of funds available to the first appellant had been  submitted.
    She was therefore awarded zero points  for  Maintenance  (Funds).   The
    refusal letter relating to the second appellant was based upon the same
    facts.

 4. The grounds of appeal stated  that  following  the  submission  of  the
    application, whilst it was pending, the  appellant  received  a  letter
    from the respondent dated 11 December 2013 requesting  that  financial
    documents be filed within seven working days and that, thereafter,  the
    appellant  submitted  her  mother's  fixed  deposit   receipts,   birth
    certificate,  affidavit  in  support  and  also  her   husband's   bank
    statements.  This was all  done  by  recorded  delivery.   The  grounds
    contended  that  the  respondent  appeared  not  to  have   given   any
    consideration to those documents and to have refused the application on
    the basis of the documents originally submitted.

 5. Albeit that the judge accepted the subsequent  documents  furnished  by
    the appellants he found at paragraph 10 of his decision that  the  bank
    statements relating to the second appellant is dated 9 May  2012  which
    is manifestly considerably more than 31 days  before  the  application.
    The letter from Oriental Bank of Commerce is dated 23 August 2013 which
    is also more than 31 days before the date of the application.  Even  if
    the respondent had taken these  documents  into  account  her  decision
    would inevitably have been the same.  The documentation  did  not  show
    the appellants could meet the requirements of Appendix C.

 6. The appellants sought  permission  to  appeal.   That  application  was
    considered by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Heynes who in a decision
    dated 4 August 2014 found no arguable error of law disclosed within the
    application.

 7. Permission was sought to apply to the Upper Tribunal.   Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Reeds, on 18 November 2014, gave permission.  Her reasons for  so
    doing are:

         "(1) The issue in this case arises from the  applicants  submitting
             documents in the form of statements from the  banks  concerned
             relating to term deposits.  It is arguable that the judge  did
             not consider whether the appellants could satisfy the Rules by
             the evidence provided in this form."

 8. Before me today there was no appearance by the appellants or indeed any
    representative instructed by them.  I  therefore  caused  my  clerk  to
    telephone the instructed representatives who indicated  that  they  had
    forwarded to the Tribunal  by  recorded  delivery  a  request  for  the
    Tribunal to deal with the appeal on papers.

 9. That document was unavailable to me.  I therefore, as  the  matter  was
    still listed for hearing, decided to proceed to deal with  it  on  that
    basis.  In so doing I invited Mr Avery to make submissions.

10.  He  argued  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  directed   himself
    appropriately.  The appellants were required to produce  evidence  that
    fell within the required time period and clearly  did  not.   The  fact
    that they were term deposit certificates did not enable the  appellants
    to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules and accordingly there
    is no error within the decision of the First-tier Judge.

11. It was incumbent upon the first appellant  to  show  that  she  was  in
    possession of �3,000 for a consecutive 28 day period to meet the Tier 4
    (General) Student Migrant Maintenance (Funds) requirements as  required
    by paragraph 1A of Appendix C of  the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as
    amended).  I note that her application was made on 27 December 2012 and
    that the closing date of the bank statements submitted  in  support  of
    her application is dated 21 November 2012.  It is therefore  more  than
    one month prior to the appellant's application date  and  as  such  the
    appellant was unable to meet the requirements  of  the  Rules  and  the
    respondent did not take the document into account  when  assessing  her
    funds.  That led to a conclusion that she was unable to meet the  level
    of funds required to be granted as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant.



12. The grant for permission suggested it is arguable that  the  judge  did
    not consider whether the appellants could  satisfy  the  Rules  by  the
    evidence provided.  That is  plainly  not  the  position.   This  is  a
    detailed decision where the judge  takes  into  account  not  just  the
    evidence but the totality of the arguments as to whether or  not  as  a
    consequent failure the appellants could meet the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The decision of the judge was open to  be  made  on
    the evidence that was before him.  Cogent and sustainable reasons  have
    been given by him for coming to the findings that he did.

13. The making of the previous involved the making of no error on  a  point
    of law and I do not set aside the decision  but  order  that  it  shall
    stand.

14. No anonymity direction is made.



Signed        Date 31 December 2014.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Appleyard
