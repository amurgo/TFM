                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms N Patel, instructed by Lei Dat & Baig Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Zuhair Juma, date of birth  7.11.83,  is  a  citizen  of
    Bahrain.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Brunnen promulgated 6.6.14, dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decisions of the respondent,  dated  28.2.14,  to  refuse  his  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims and to refuse him leave
    to enter and to remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal  on
    3.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    30.6.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 18.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Brunnen should be set aside.

 6. In summary, the grounds of application for permission to appeal assert:

      a) That the judge erred in law by ignoring material considerations; at
         �16 the judge did not make clear what question/answer  he  referred
         to from the appellant's evidence  which  amounts  to  a  procedural
         error and a failure to give adequate reasoning;

      b) That the judge failed to consider that the appellant made a  simple
         mistake in a long and  detailed  interview  and  corrected  himself
         immediately; Q197 & 198;

      c)  That  the  judge  erred  in  attaching  too  much  weight  to  the
         appellant's inability to  name  the  organisation  led  by  Ibrahim
         Sharif, whereas the appellant was able to name some other political
         figures;

      d) That the judge erred at �22 by finding that the appellant's answers
         evasive but failed to give any examples of the evasiveness.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Osborne noted, "In an otherwise
    careful and  detailed  determination  in  which  the  judge  manifestly
    engaged with the evidence, it is nonetheless arguable  that  the  judge
    erred in law in finding  that  the  appellant  cannot  be  expected  to
    renounce his views in order to avoid persecution but by expressing them
    in the  manner  he  desires  he  would  not  put  himself  at  risk  of
    persecution. There  is  considerable  background  information/objective
    evidence to support the assertion/submission that someone such  as  the
    appellant may well be at risk of arrest and  detention  for  expressing
    his views. This arguable error of law having been identified,  all  the
    issues raised in the grounds are arguable.

 8. The Rule 24 response, dated  10.7.14,  simply  stated  that  the  judge
    directed himself appropriately.

 9. At �25 of the decision, the  judge  dealt  with  the  particular  issue
    identified by Judge Osborne in the grant of permission,  following  the
    submission of Ms Patel that he would be at risk merely  on  account  of
    holding his political views. This, of course, begs the question of what
    views the appellant held and in what way intended to express them.

10. The answer to that is found in �24  of  the  determination,  where  the
    judge rejected the appellant's factual account of  events  in  Bahrain,
    but accepted "that he attended demonstrations and took photographs  but
    I have no doubt that thousands of other Bahrainis did  the  same."  The
    judge did not accept that the authorities made any  attempt  to  detain
    this appellant, or that a summons had been served on him, or  that  his
    acquaintances had been arrested. On the evidence,  the  judge  did  not
    accept that the authorities had  shown  any  adverse  interest  in  the
    appellant and concluded that they would not do so were he to return  to
    Bahrain. In earlier paragraphs of the decision the judge set out why he
    doubted the credibility of the appellant and his  account.  It  is  not
    necessary to repeat those reasons here, but I find that they  comprised
    cogent reasons for reaching a conclusion that the account could not  be
    believed, a conclusion I find was open to the  judge  on  the  evidence
    before him.

11. The question of risk on return therefore was not to  be  considered  on
    the basis of the appellant's claimed account, but on the findings  that
    he had simply attended demonstrations in Bahrain, along with  thousands
    of other demonstrators, and that  he,  along  with  many  others,  took
    photographs. At �21 the judge did not accept that the appellant  was  a
    genuine political activist, noting that whilst he was able to name  the
    leader of a political organisation, he  was  unable  to  identify  that
    organisation. The rest of the appellant's account is excluded.

12. The  judge  accepted  that  the  authorities  reacted  harshly  to  the
    demonstrations but did not accept that there had been a general attempt
    to arrest all those who  took  photographs.  By  implication  the  only
    political  views  the  appellant  held  were  merely   those   of   the
    demonstrators in general, i.e. that they wanted  greater  civil  rights
    and a democratic government.

13. As Mr Patel put it in his brief submissions, it is a simple point. Is a
    person who attended such mass demonstrations and  took  photographs  at
    risk on return. He referred me to pages 106, 113, 117 and  118  of  the
    appellant's bundle, which I have  carefully  considered.  However,  the
    information there is entirely consistent with the judge's  findings  at
    �24 that the authorities reacted harshly to  the  demonstrations,  that
    there have been many arrests and that some of those arrested have  been
    ill-treated.

14. The reports include that of a free-lance photographer sentenced  to  10
    years imprisonment, but he was not imprisoned for being a photographer.
    The report explains that he was charged with and convicted at trial  of
    participating in an attack on a police station. His case  was  that  he
    was at the police station to document the attack as part of coverage of
    the unrest since the anti-government protests of February 2011. Another
    journalist was imprisoned on allegations of inciting  public  disorder.
    Other reports are of outspoken activist. The Human Rights Watch  report
    (A117) reports that  security  forces  continue  to  detain  scores  of
    individuals arbitrarily every month and are  interrogated  without  the
    presence of a lawyer.  Many  detainees  complain  of  ill-treatment  in
    detention, sometimes rising to the level of torture. On the findings of
    the judge this appellant is neither  a  freelance  photographer  nor  a
    vocal activist, nor had  he  come  to  the  adverse  attention  of  the
    authorities.

15. But it follows from the judge's findings  that  there  was  no  adverse
    interest in this appellant whilst he was in Bahrain and  no  particular
    reason to have any continued interest in the  appellant,  being  merely
    one of very many people involved in the  demonstrations.  It  does  not
    follow that the authorities have any knowledge  of  his  attendance  or
    taking of photographs. He is not a political activist but attended  the
    demonstrations  as  part  of  the  general  crowd  of  people,  one  of
    thousands. There is no credible evidence that he  genuinely  holds  any
    anti-regime views.

16. The judge accepted that if he were to be detained there was a  risk  of
    ill-treatment, but  nothing  within  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal would amount to reason to detain and ill-treat this  appellant
    on return to Bahrain. He had not been detained; his  acquaintances  had
    not been detained; and he has done nothing to cause the authorities  to
    have any adverse interest in him.

17. In the circumstances, I find that the conclusion of the judge that  the
    appellant had failed to demonstrate to the lower standard of proof  any
    risk on return by reason of so-called political views, was one open  to
    the judge and for which cogent reasons have been given.

18. There is little merit in any of the remaining  grounds  of  appeal.  In
    particular, I reject the submission that there was any procedural error
    in �16 of the decision by not referencing the  precise  question/answer
    numbers. The appellant has only to read the interview and  the  reasons
    for refusal. The complaint that the appellant had made a simple mistake
    in his answer was addressed by the judge and this ground of  appeal  is
    no more than an attempt to reargue the appeal.

19. The complaint about �22 and the judge's finding that the appellant  was
    evasive has no merit. The judge gave examples within the same paragraph
    as to the appellant's answers  which  the  judge  found  he  could  not
    accept. Similarly, the complaint as to �23  has  no  merit.  The  judge
    recorded the appellant's oral evidence denying that he had applied  for
    a visa to Australia and then cited the answer given in  interview.  The
    appellant's rationalisation is also cited, that the office he  went  to
    also handled applications for Australia but he only applied for  an  UK
    visa. Nothing could be plainer; he denied that which he had  stated  in
    interview.

Conclusion & Decision:

20. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
