For the Appellant:     Ms A Holmes, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr E Mungoni, the Sponsor, in person


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appeal comes before the  Upper  Tribunal  following  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal to the Entry Clearance Officer by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge P J M Hollingworth) on 17th October 2014.  For the ease
    of reference, I shall continue to refer to the Entry Clearance  Officer
    as the Respondent and to Mrs Dongo  as  the  Appellant.   No  anonymity
    order was made by the First-tier Tribunal and no request has been  made
    of the Upper Tribunal either at the hearing that took place before  the
    First-tier Tribunal on 24th July 2014 or that of the present appeal  on
    11th December 2014.

 2. The background to the appeal is as follows.   On  26th  April  2013  an
    application was made by the Appellant for entry clearance as the spouse
    of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom.  A decision  was
    made on that application  on  10th  June  2013.   The  application  was
    refused and the basis of the refusal was that the  Respondent  did  not
    accept that the Sponsor was exempt from the financial  requirements  as
    defined in paragraph E-ECP.3.3.  The Entry Clearance Officer went on to
    state:-

         "You have not provided your Sponsor's payslips for the  six  months
         before this application was made and the  statements  of  the  bank
         account that the salary deposits were made into is evidence of your
         Sponsor's gross  income  from  their  employment  /  you  and  your
         Sponsor's savings and other income sources.   You  have  failed  to
         provide the specified documents of your  Sponsor's  income.   These
         documents are specified in the Immigration Rules in Appendix  FM-SE
         and must be provided.  I therefore refuse  your  application  under
         paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  (E-
         ECP.3.1)."

    The documents that the Appellant had provided with the application were
    set out at Annex D and  referred  to  in  the  ECM's  review  namely  a
    document to confirm an annual salary, copy of a P60 for the year  2012,
    payslips, copy  of  UK  residence  permit  and  an  invitation  letter.
    Further documents were sent with the appeal  namely  copy  of  marriage
    certificate, confirmation of annual salary, copy  medical  certificate,
    copy P60 tax certificate, Barclays Bank statements,  an  IELTS  report,
    supporting letters and there was a document verification report.

 3. Following the refusal the Appellant sought to appeal that decision  and
    submitted Grounds of Appeal setting out the past  history  noting  that
    his wife had originally applied for a visa in 2013 but had been refused
    under the new English language test which was later successfully taken.
     In the later submissions provided to the Entry Clearance Officer,  the
    grounds noted that the Entry Clearance Officer had not  considered  the
    documents (the HMRC  P60,  letters  from  employers,  bank  statements,
    etc.).  It was further noted in the  grounds  that  were  submitted  at
    [D18] that the Entry Clearance  Officer  had  noted  that  he  had  not
    submitted six months' payslips under Appendix FM-SE  and  that  he  had
    submitted three months' payslips and bank statements but the reason for
    not providing the six months'  consecutive  payslips  was  due  to  the
    "geographical nature of my company I work for.  It is foreign based and
    efforts to generate payslips once issued and distributed is  cumbersome
    and in legal terms tantamount to fraud it is said."  The letter went on
    to say "I therefore feel that the ECO  erred  by  failing  to  exercise
    his/her  discretion  under  Appendix  FM-SE  Family  D(e)   under   the
    provision."

 4. It is plain from reading the Grounds of Appeal that the  Appellant  was
    seeking for the Entry Clearance Officer to invoke the discretion  under
    the above provision as there were valid reasons for not submitting  the
    payslips in question.

 5. On 20th November 2013 the Entry Clearance  Manager  appeal  review  was
    undertaken, it is stated at Annex D that having reviewed  the  decision
    and taking into account the  Grounds  of  Appeal,  including  documents
    "submitted under Section 108 for IJ eyes only not included".  The Entry
    Clearance Manager review made reference to the documents that  had  not
    been produced and made reference to additional checks that were carried
    out in relation to the Appellant's employment  on  19th  November  2013
    which were contained in a  document  verification  report.   The  Entry
    Clearance Manager noted that she was satisfied that the  Appellant  was
    not receiving the required level of income  six  months  prior  to  the
    submission  of  the  application  and  therefore  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of family migration EC-P1.1.  Thus the decision to  refuse
    entry clearance was maintained.

 6. The Appellant exercised her right to appeal and the matter came  before
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Wellesley-Cole) sitting at Taylor  House
    on 24th July 2014.  At that  hearing  the  Appellant  was  not  legally
    represented but the judge heard from the Sponsor, Mr  Mungoni  and  the
    Entry Clearance Officer was represented by a Presenting Officer.  In  a
    determination promulgated on 2nd September  2014  Judge  Wellesley-Cole
    allowed the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules.   It  is  plain  from
    reading the determination that the only issue that had been  identified
    in the refusal letter was that the Sponsor had not  submitted  payslips
    for the relevant period which is  October  2012  to  March  2013.   The
    judge, considered all of the documentary evidence before her  including
    the P60, bank statements, HMRC documents, letters from his employer and
    also what is referred to as a "restricted email".   Having  taken  into
    account the documents, the judge found that the evidence of the Sponsor
    was wholly consistent with the documents and that his  credibility  had
    not been undermined in any way.  Thus she found that she was  satisfied
    that he was able to  satisfy  the  Rules  as  she  found  that  he  was
    receiving the requisite funds for the period October-March 2013 on  the
    basis that he  earned  ï¿½4,400  per  month.   She  found  at  [8]  "that
    discretion should have been exercised accordingly as  set  out  above".
    Thus she allowed the appeal.

 7. The Entry Clearance Officer sought permission to appeal  that  decision
    and permission was granted on 17th October 2014.

 8. Thus the appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.  Mr Mungoni appeared on
    behalf of the Appellant and the Entry Clearance Officer was represented
    by Ms A Holmes, Senior  Presenting  Officer.   At  the  outset  of  the
    proceedings I ensured that Mr Mungoni had copies of  all  the  relevant
    documents and explained to him the issues that were  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 9. Ms Holmes sought to rely on the grounds  as  drafted.   She  began  her
    submissions stating that the judge erred in law  as  a  result  of  her
    conclusions at [6] and [7] and that the  judge  found  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer should have exercised a discretion and  make  further
    enquiries under "FM-SE D(e)"  but  went  on  to  find  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer should have exercised a discretion but the judge then
    went to exercise her discretion by  allowing  the  appeal.   Ms  Holmes
    submitted that that was wrong and that even if FM-SE  D(e)  did  apply,
    the judge failed to make any findings as to whether or  not  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer had been given a "valid reason" by the  Appellant  or
    Sponsor at the date  of  decision  and  secondly,  the  judge  made  no
    findings about the Appellant's  actual  evidence  which  was  not  that
    payslips could not be produced but that it was cumbersome and therefore
    on that basis FM-SE D(e) could not apply in any event.

10.  By  reference  to  the  decision  of  Sultana   and   Others   (Rules:
    waiver/further enquiry; discretion) [2014] UKUT  00540,  she  submitted
    that there had never been any request made by the Sponsor  to  exercise
    any discretion in her favour.  However, Ms  Holmes  had  not  seen  the
    letter at D17 dated 8th July 2013 where it made a  clear  reference  to
    the  difficulties  of  providing  the  specified   documents   due   to
    "operational reasons" and specifically asking for a  discretion  to  be
    exercised.  In the light of that document, Ms Holmes  stated  that  she
    could not disagree with that document and that there had been  evidence
    before the Entry Clearance Officer that a discretion should be applied.
     However she submitted that even if the first two grounds were not made
    out, the third ground was, because she could not allow the appeal under
    the Rules but could only allow the appeal to the  limited  extent  that
    there was a discretion to be exercised by the Entry Clearance  Officer.
    Thus she had erred in law in that respect.

11. Mr Mungoni confirmed to the Tribunal what he had  told  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that there had been what he described as "logistical problems"
    about being paid and that they were still getting  their  salaries  and
    disbursements from abroad.   He  said  that  three  payslips  had  been
    provided but that he could not have provided the six  payslips  due  to
    those logistical problems.  He referred to the money that was deposited
    in the bank accounts which were payments from his employment which were
    paid into the Barclays account.  He confirmed that the letter  that  he
    had written to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  a  request  for  a
    discretion to be exercised.  Mr Mungoni stated that it was open to  the
    judge to use her own discretion.  He said that he had failed to produce
    the payslips due to logistical and geographical problems  and  that  he
    was still employed by the same company and was  still  being  paid  the
    same salary.  He said that he had  never  worked  for  another  company
    having come to the UK  in  2003  on  a  work  permit  visa.   His  wife
    originally accompanied him as his dependant.  He had always worked as a
    station manager and that was the basis upon which his work  permit  had
    been provided.  The original work permit was valid until 2006  and  was
    renewed again for another five years.  He obtained a settlement visa in
    2008.  He said that his wife's visa expired in 2011 and she returned to
    Zimbabwe in March 2011 as she was looking after her  mother.   He  said
    that after her mother had passed away she applied for entry  clearance.
    He had no dependent children as they were all over 18 but  relied  upon
    the documents that he had provided before the First-tier Tribunal.

12. I reserved my determination.

13. The Entry Clearance  Officer  relies  upon  three  Grounds  of  Appeal.
    Before considering those grounds, and the concession made by Ms Holmes,
    Senior Presenting Officer it is necessary to consider the  findings  of
    fact made by the judge.  As set out in  the  preceding  paragraphs  the
    only basis upon which  the  application  was  refused  related  to  the
    Appellant's failure to provide the specified evidence in  the  form  of
    the payslips and corresponding bank statements.   The  relevant  period
    being October 2012 to March 2013.

14. The judge's findings can be summarised as follows.  The judge  accepted
    the Sponsor's evidence unreservedly and found that  the  oral  evidence
    that he had given was wholly consistent with the  documentary  evidence
    that had been produced not only by the Sponsor but also by his employer
    and from the information that was contained in  a  "restricted  email".
    Thus she accepted and found on the facts that  he  had  earned  ï¿½52,800
    gross as a station manager employed in London and that  this  had  been
    employment that he had been employed  in  since  2003  with  a  monthly
    salary of  ï¿½4,400.   She  further  found  that  owing  to  "operational
    challenges" when they stopped flying into the UK, the company last paid
    staff in February 2013 but had plans  to  resume  payment.   The  judge
    placed weight on a letter from  his  employers  dated  6th  April  2014
    confirming his gross salary, the payroll office number was  given,  the
    salary was credited on a monthly basis to a Barclays Bank international
    account and that confirmation had been produced that PAYE and  national
    insurance contributions  had  been  paid  to  the  HMRC  and  giving  a
    reference number for such payments.  The judge also made reference to a
    most recent payment of ï¿½12,088 and for another payment to be  processed
    in July 2013.  The judge also found that the  restricted  email  showed
    that he had been paid up until February 2013 but taking  that  evidence
    in conjunction with the employer's letter confirmed that  he  continued
    to be paid through the relevant period.

15. It is plain from reading  the  determination  that  in  reaching  those
    findings the judge  placed  weight  and  credence  upon  the  Sponsor's
    evidence at [6] and the restricted air mail referred to by the judge at
    [5]-[6].  The judge noted at [5] that she placed weight on the evidence
    in the restricted email  as  she  considered  it  to  emanate  from  an
    official source and also she had the advantage of the letter dated  6th
    June 2014 from his employers.  It is  therefore  also  plain  from  the
    evidence which she wholly accepted, that  the  Sponsor  was  one  month
    short (for the specified evidence) but placed weight on  the  Sponsor's
    oral testimony that he had been paid throughout the period as this  was
    consistent with the written evidence.

16. It was against that background that the judge considered Appendix FM-SE
    D(e) which reads as follows:-

         "Where the decision maker is satisfied that there is a valid reason
         why a specified document cannot be supplied e.g. because it is  not
         issued in a particular country or has been permanently lost, he  or
         she may exercise discretion not to apply the  requirement  for  the
         document or to request alternative  or  additional  information  or
         documents be submitted by the applicant."

17. In this context the judge at [7] considered that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer did require extra information and that had appeared in the form
    of the email and the document verification report.  The judge  went  on
    to state at [7] that the evidence before her and acknowledged  by  her,
    was that with the bank statements and his assertion that his employment
    was not undermined during the course  of  cross-examination,  when  set
    against the letters from  his  employers  confirming  he  had  been  in
    continuous employment in the HMRC documents,  that  the  Appellant  had
    made out her case.  At [8] the judge found that she  could  fulfil  the
    requirements  as  her  husband  and  Sponsor  had  been  in  continuous
    employment, did have the requisite funds as he earned  ï¿½4,400  a  month
    and that "discretion should have been exercised accordingly as set  out
    above on that basis" and thus she allowed the appeal.

18. Whilst the drafted grounds at 5(c) submitted that the decision to allow
    the matter under the Rules was wrong on the basis that  even  if  FM-SE
    D(e) did apply, the judge had failed to make findings as to whether the
    ECO had been furnished with a valid reason by  the  date  of  decision,
    this was not relied upon by Ms Holmes.  For sake of completeness,  even
    if she had relied upon that, I do not find that that ground is made out
    when reading the determination as a whole.  It is entirely  plain  that
    from reading not only the Grounds of Appeal submitted by Mr Mungoni  in
    which he made it plain that it was due to "operational reasons" that he
    could not provide the specified evidence but that was the thrust of the
    case put before the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Indeed  at  [5]  she  made
    reference to the "operational changes" that had caused the difficulties
    with providing the specified evidence due to the way  the  company  was
    dealing with payments to employees.  Whilst there had been a  reference
    made in the original Grounds of Appeal to the provision of payslips  as
    "cumbersome" that did not accurately  reflect  the  evidence  that  was
    given before the judge and supported by the documentary evidence.  Thus
    the judge did find that there was a "valid reason" given to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and indeed that had been made plain within the letter
    of July 2013 to the Entry Clearance Manager.  In my judgment the  whole
    thrust of the determination was  that  the  Sponsor  had  provided  the
    specified evidence insofar as he was able and that the evidence he  had
    produced  was  consistent  with  the  evidence  contained  within   the
    restricted email in conjunction with the letter of June 2014  from  his
    employers.  The judge found  that  the  oral  testimony  given  by  the
    Sponsor was wholly consistent with the  documentary  evidence.   As  at
    [8], the judge concluded that "discretion should  have  been  exercised
    accordingly as set out above" in which the judge was referring  to  the
    evidence that had been before her.

19. As Ms Holmes submitted Appendix FM-SE D(e) provides the decision  maker
    with a discretion which is vested in him under  the  Immigration  Rules
    but that the judge did not assess whether FM-SE D(e) was  purported  to
    be applied by the Entry Clearance Officer when the decision  was  made.
    If the discretion had not been applied, the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    could only have allowed the appeal on the basis that the  decision  was
    not one that was in accordance with the law for failure  to  apply  the
    discretion in the Rules.

20. I consider that Ms Holmes is right in this regard.  The Appendix  FM-SE
    does make it clear that where the decision maker has a discretion which
    is vested in him under the Immigration  Rules,  the  exercise  of  that
    discretion is appealable before the Tribunal.  However, the  appeal  on
    this specific ground  arises  once  the  decision  maker  has  lawfully
    exercised his discretion  in  the  making  of  the  decision.   If  the
    decision maker fails to exercise his discretion, that  failure  renders
    his decision "not in accordance with the law"  and,  because  it  is  a
    discretion  which  is  vested  in  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  the
    appropriate course is to require the decision  maker  to  complete  his
    task by reaching a lawful  decision  on  the  outstanding  application.
    Thus where such an issue arises,  as  it  has  in  this  case,  it  was
    incumbent  upon  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  determine  whether  the
    Respondent, or in this case the Entry Clearance Officer was required to
    make a fresh and lawful decision (see the decision of the  Tribunal  in
    Ukus (Discretion: when reviewable) [2012] UKUT 307 at  [10]).   As  the
    Tribunal noted, it requires the original decision to be examined by the
    Tribunal, not as to whether the judge  agrees  or  disagrees  with  the
    outcome, but to distinguish between  those  cases  where  the  decision
    maker has not exercised a discretion at all and those where he has done
    so but in  a  manner  that  permits  the  discretion  to  be  exercised
    differently.  In this case, and as Ms Holmes accepted the Appellant had
    asked the Entry Clearance Officer to exercise the discretion  contained
    in Appendix FM-SE D(e) in the letter of 8th July 2013 and made specific
    reference to it.  There had  been  reference  in  that  letter  to  the
    difficulties of providing the specified evidence.  The judge also found
    from the evidence that the Entry Clearance  Officer  sought  to  engage
    part of that paragraph by seeking and  requesting  further  information
    which was contained in the document verification report.  However,  the
    restricted email was also before the Entry  Clearance  Officer  manager
    before the review was undertaken and despite that material  being  made
    available which the  judge  went  on  to  find  demonstrated  that  the
    Appellant could meet  the  Rules  in  that  the  documents  when  taken
    together demonstrated that he had been paid ï¿½4,400 per month  and  that
    his salary was ï¿½52,800 per annum which was supported  by  letters  from
    his employer and the HMCS documents. However at the review  before  the
    Entry  Clearance  Manager  made  no  reference  to  any   exercise   of
    discretion.  In those circumstances, it was not open to  the  judge  to
    exercise the discretion herself.  Thus what the judge should have  done
    was to find that this was a case in which the  discretion  should  have
    been exercised and in those circumstances to have allowed the appeal to
    the limited extent to remit the appeal to the Secretary of State for  a
    lawful decision to  be  made  and  to  exercise  the  discretion  under
    Appendix FM-SE D(e).

21. In those circumstances, I find the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.  I
    set aside the decision and substitute a decision allowing the appeal on
    the basis that the Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the
    law, it now being for the Respondent to decide whether to exercise  the
    discretion on the basis of the nature of the application made  and  the
    evidence that has been given by the Appellant and Sponsor.

Decision

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside; it is  remade  as
    follows.  The appeal is allowed to the limited extent that the decision
    was not in accordance with the law as set out at paragraph 20  of  this
    decision.
