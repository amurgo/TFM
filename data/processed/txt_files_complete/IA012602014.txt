Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Wood (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, (born July 24,  1964  is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan.  The
    appellant entered the United  Kingdom  on  April  6,  2008  with  entry
    clearance as a student valid until August 3, 2008. On July 29, 2008  he
    applied for further leave to remain as a student and this  was  granted
    until August 31, 2009. He met his EEA national ex-wife, Ms Andras,  and
    he applied for permission to marry her on May  15,  2009.  The  parties
    married on July 20, 2009 and on  August  25,  2009  he  applied  for  a
    residence card which was issued and was valid until September 8,  2014.
    They divorced on March 11, 2013 and on July 24,  2013  he  applied  for
    retention of rights under Regulation 10 of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 as  a  family  member.  The  respondent
    refused his application on December 13, 2013.

 2. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and  Regulation  26
    of the 2006 Regulations on December 28, 2013. On May 1, 2014  Judge  of
    the First Tier Tribunal Herwald (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ")
    heard his appeal. He refused his appeal under the EEA Regulations in  a
    determination promulgated on May 13, 2014.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on May 21, 2014 and on  June  3,
    2014 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Page  refused  permission  to
    appeal. The grounds were renewed to the Upper Tribunal  and  on  August
    21, 2014 Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor found it arguable the  FtTJ  had
    erred by failing to have regard to the appellant's written evidence  or
    by failing to give adequate reasons.  He  also  found  it  was  further
    arguable that the FtTJ's reasoning in paragraph [13(i)] was irrational.



 4. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response  dated  September  3,  2014  in
    which she stated there was no error in law and the FtTJ was entitled to
    find the evidence did not  demonstrate  his  ex-wife  was  a  qualified
    person for the requisite period.

 5. The appellant attended the hearing before me and was represented by  Mr
    Wood.

    SUBMISSIONS


 6. Mr Wood adopted his grounds of appeal and submitted:


      a. There was  ample  evidence  before  the  FtTJ  to  demonstrate  the
         appellant's ex-wife was working and exercising treaty rights as  at
         the date of their divorce. Page 23 of the original bundle contained
         a copy of the appellant's ex-wife's online HMRC Tax submission  for
         2012/2013 and page 25 contained the  income  and  expenditure  form
         that confirmed her self-employed income. The figure of �2,993 could
         be seen on the tax return as "profit  from  self-employment".  This
         was adequate evidence that the appellant's ex-wife was  working  at
         the relevant time.


      b. The FtTJ should have given more weight  to  the  appellant's  claim
         that his ex-wife was working at the  relevant  date  despite  there
         being no actual documents to prove this. The FtTJ should  have  had
         had regard to the fact the appellant was now divorced from his wife
         and obtaining documents is not that easy.


      c. His finding that  the  appellant's  wife  was  a  drug  addict  was
         irrational as the appellant had merely said the marriage had broken
         down partly because she began to take drugs. This did not mean  she
         was a drug addict.


 7. Mrs Pettersen responded  to  the  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  and
    submitted there was no error in law. She submitted:

      a. The FtTJ's decision was neither perverse nor irrational.  The  FtTJ
         took into account the appellant's own evidence about his  ex-wife's
         own drug use and concluded that without documents the evidence  was
         not reliable and therefore anything the appellant claimed  to  have
         been told  was  also  unreliable.  The  FtTJ  was  entitled  to  be
         cautious.


      b. The FtTJ was conscious of the problems divorcees sometimes face but
         in this  appeal  the  appellant  and  his  legal  advisors  had  an
         authority to obtain evidence about her employment and had failed to
         submit the relevant documents either with the application or to the
         First-tier Tribunal. The FtTJ was entitled to make the  finding  he
         did and reject the appellant's explanation.


      c. The evidence at pages 23 and 25 did not  prove  the  appellant  was
         working at the date in question. It merely showed that  during  the
         financial year 2012/2013 she claimed to have  earned  �8,156.  This
         did not prove she was working as at the date of their divorce.


 8. In response to Mrs Pettersen's submissions and questions posed  by  me,
    Mr Wood further submitted:


      a. If the FtTJ  was  entitled  to  place  weight  on  the  appellant's
         evidence that she had a drug habit then  why  could  he  not  place
         similar weight on her claim to be working?


      b. The FtTJ suggested that the  solicitors  has  deliberately  omitted
         evidence and this was without any evidence to back this claim up.


      c. The document at page 48 of the supplemental  bundle  confirmed  the
         appellant was working.


 9. I reserved my decision on all issues.


    MY FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

10. The appellant applied for a retained right of residence under the  2006
    Regulations.  The  appellant  must  demonstrate  on  the   balance   of
    probabilities that he met the requirements of Regulation 10 of the 2006
    Regulations. In particular, he has to show that they were  married  for
    three years prior to the initiation of the divorce proceedings and that
    his ex-wife was a qualified person at the date of  termination  of  the
    marriage.


11. The FtTJ heard oral evidence from the appellant and he also had  before
    him three bundles of evidence.

12. The issue that led to the dismissal of his appeal was the FtTJ was  not
    satisfied  the  appellant's  ex-wife  was  working  at  the   date   of
    termination of the marriage.

13. The grounds of appeal challenged  that  finding  arguing  that  firstly
    there was the appellant's own evidence before the FtTJ and secondly the
    FtTJ had no basis to make a finding the appellant's ex-wife was a  drug
    addict and was therefore unreliable.

14. I have considered the submissions today and reviewed the evidence  that
    was available to the FtTJ. In considering whether there was an error in
    law I have not had regard to  evidence  that  has  very  recently  been
    submitted, as it was not available to the FtTJ.

15. In paragraph [9] of the appellant's witness  statement  dated  February
    11, 2014 the appellant described why his marriage broke down. He stated
    "However, our relationship began to deteriorate when Imola began taking
    drugs... It was when she began taking drugs that I could  not  tolerate
    it." At paragraph [10] he continued, "Imola started smoking  marijuana.
    I would tell her this should not be doing this but she would get  angry
    and annoyed with me. She said it helped her relax.  Later  however  she
    started taking heroine and cocaine ."  At  paragraph  [11]  he  stated,
    "Very soon after starting to take drugs Imola would be constantly short
    of money. She would demand money from me. When I refused  to  give  her
    money she would verbally fight with me and smash things up at home. Our
    once lovely home became a pigsty. It smelled of alcohol, cigarettes and
    drugs." At paragraph [12] he stated, "In a desperate  attempt  to  save
    our marriage I would give in to Imola's every demand. Imola  even  used
    my credit cards and left me with debts of  �11,000  and  used  all  our
    savings on drugs. She would also take money from me"


16. The FtTJ concluded in paragraph [13(j)] the appellant's ex-wife  was  a
    drug addict. I am satisfied the  appellant's  evidence  supported  this
    conclusion. In his own words she stole  from  him,  used  all  her  own
    money, their savings and incurred �11,000 debts  because  of  her  drug
    use. That behaviour supports the FtTJ's finding that  she  was  a  drug
    addict and he was entitled to make a finding about her as he did.

17. The real issue in this appeal is whether there  was  adequate  evidence
    before  the  FtTJ  of  the  appellant's  ex-wife  work.   Through   the
    appellant's own evidence it can be ascertained  that  they  effectively
    separated on August 5, 2012 when his ex-wife went back to  Romania  and
    Hungary to  visit  family.  She  returned  to  the  United  Kingdom  on
    September 20, 2012 and according to the appellant's statement she  left
    the marital home in October 2012. They remained in contact by phone  it
    appears but there has been no direct contact since she left in  October
    2012.

18. The FtTJ had evidence of her tax return but he did not find this proved
    she was working at the date they divorced which is what he had to show.
    A tax return merely shows an income  for  a  twelve-month  and  is  not
    evidence of when that income was earned. The FtTJ had the evidence from
    the appellant but this is based only on what he may have been told  and
    was not based on any personal knowledge because he did not  know  where
    she was living in London.

19. The FtTJ was aware that she had a drug problem and  also  had  gone  to
    Hungary and Romania and was leading a very unsettled lifestyle.

20. There was little evidence in the  bundles  that  demonstrated  she  was
    working in any capacity as at the date of their divorce.  The  invoices
    at pages 61 and 62 did not prove she was cleaning at that date.

21. If the appellant had produced evidence of her employment or details  of
    her working as at March 11, 2013  then  the  FtTJ  could  have  made  a
    different finding to that he made in his determination.

22. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the findings made were  open  to  him.
    There is no material error of law as submitted. I dismiss the appeal.

23. The appellant's solicitors  have  submitted  an  additional  bundle  of
    evidence dated November 18, 2014. This  bundle  was  not  submitted  in
    accordance with the Upper Tribunal Judge's directions. This bundle  had
    no relevance to the error of law hearing, as I am only  concerned  with
    evidence that was before the FtTJ.

24.  There  are  documents  in  this  bundle,  which  if  accepted  by  the
    respondent, would tend to show the appellant's ex-wife was employed  at
    March 11, 2013. That  would  be  a  matter  for  the  respondent  if  a
    subsequent  application  was  made  and  this  comment  is  merely   an
    observation.

    DECISION


25. There was no material error of law  and  the  original  decision  shall
    stand.

26. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
