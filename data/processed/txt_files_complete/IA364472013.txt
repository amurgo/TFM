                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State appeals with permission  granted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal against the determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Place
    sitting  at  Nottingham  on  25  April  2014  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 2 May 2014 allowed the claimant's, Miss Bohsu's,  appeal
    against the refusal of the Secretary of  State  to  issue  her  with  a
    document recognising her entitlement to reside in  the  United  Kingdom
    pursuant to the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006.
    The basis of the claimant's application for such a  document  was  that
    she satisfied the requirements of paragraph 15A of the  Regulations  in
    that she was the primary carer of a British citizen; that  the  British
    citizen is residing in the  United  Kingdom;  and  that  "the  relevant
    British citizen would be unable to reside in the UK or in  another  EEA
    state if [she] was required to leave".

2.   The grant of permission by the  Upper  Tribunal  specifically  required
    the Secretary of State to assist as to whether there is  any  authority
    on the point of what is meant by "unable to reside in the UK".  Through
    no fault of Mr Whitwell who appears on behalf of the Secretary of State
    before me, that has not been complied with.  Mr Whitwell indeed has not
    had sight of the grant of permission until  the  hearing  today.   That
    does place the Tribunal in some difficulty and certainly  precludes  it
    from enjoying submissions  by  reference  to  authority  or  any  other
    relevant materials.  The difficulty is compounded by reason of the fact
    that Miss Bohsu is unable to afford legal  representation  and  appears
    before me unrepresented.

3.   The First-tier Judge made findings on the basis of oral  evidence  from
    Miss Bohsu.  There was also cross-examination  of  Miss  Bohsu  by  the
    Presenting Officer who appeared at the First-tier  Tribunal.   We  note
    from paragraph 10 that the Presenting Officer asked the  claimant  when
    she last had contact with child E's father, child E being Miss  Bohsu's
    son.  The claimant replied that they were not in real contact  now  and
    that the father, as soon as he had found out  that  she  was  pregnant,
    said he did not ask for this and when the baby was born he did not want
    to know.  Recently he had been doing what  he  could  but  it  was  not
    enough.  He would occasionally pick  child  E  up,  maybe  fortnightly,
    maybe once a month.  He might buy him something like shoes from time to
    time.  The claimant did not know where the father lived and he was  not
    aware when she made the application for residence.  She had  only  been
    able to discuss the application with him recently, "he told her that he
    is not ready to take full responsibility for child E and that it  would
    be easier if she were able to work".  The  evidence  continued  by  the
    claimant describing how she lived with her cousin who was like a sister
    to her and she  helped  with  the  cousin's  child  care.   Her  cousin
    provided nearly everything financially.  Child E's  father  would  make
    occasional contributions.  Around Christmas he lost contact for several
    months although he had given ï¿½100 for the upkeep of child  E.   He  had
    also attended child E's baptism in May 2010.

4.   The judge's findings begin at paragraph 18 of her  determination.   She
    noted that the Presenting Officer submitted that the claimant was not a
    credible witness and that it could  not  be  accepted  that  Child  E's
    father was not actively involved in his life.  The  judge  found  this:
    "To the contrary, I found that the appellant's evidence was  consistent
    and plausible.  It is true that she was not able to  be  precise  about
    the amount of involvement that child E's father had had  in  his  son's
    life but I find that this is because of the haphazard  nature  of  that
    involvement  rather  than  any  attempt  on  the  appellant's  part  to
    dissimulate". I note in this regard that this credibility  finding  has
    not been challenged by the Secretary of State; in any  case,  it  could
    only  have  been  challenged  on  limited  grounds,  essentially  those
    relating to irrationality.  That however has not been done.  The  judge
    then continued by finding that child E's father had  occasionally  made
    contact with the  claimant  but  there  had  been  "no  consistency  or
    reliability about the frequency or nature of that contact".  Whilst the
    father has made the occasional little more than token  contribution  to
    the cost of child E's upbringing, "on the whole he has sought to  avoid
    his responsibilities as a father and left the appellant as  child's  Es
    sole carer".  The  judge  then  went  on  to  find  that  she  had  "no
    hesitation in finding that the appellant is child E's primary carer for
    the purposes of paragraph 25A(4A).  She cares for  him  physically  and
    emotionally.   She  takes  all  responsibility  for  his   health   and
    education.   She  is  assisted  with  the  financial  costs   of   this
    responsibility by friends and family".   The  judge  then  went  on  to
    consider whether child E would  be  unable  to  reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom if the claimant were required to leave.   The  judge  noted  in
    this regard that it was unreasonable to expect  a  British  citizen  to
    leave the United Kingdom.  She also noted that child E's best interests
    were "clearly tied up with the appellant, he  is  still  a  very  young
    child".  She noted  that  child  E  was  completely  dependent  on  the
    claimant in every sense, "even if his father were to have an  overnight
    change of character and become willing to shoulder his responsibilities
    as a father, it would be detrimental to child E to take him  away  from
    the appellant who has intimately cared for him all his  life.   If  the
    appellant were required to leave the United Kingdom child E would  have
    to go with her".

5.   The Secretary of State challenges  those  findings.   She  does  so  by
    contending that the test of whether the British citizen child would  be
    unable to reside in the United Kingdom is a stringent one and that mere
    disinclination  and  reluctance  were  not  itself   to   satisfy   the
    substantial requirement of the regulations.

6.   Before me Mr Whitwell submitted the European  Operational  Policy  Team
    Caseworker Directions which govern matters of this kind.  There  is  no
    indication that this document was submitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge.  I note that  the  directions  take  the  line  adopted  by  the
    Secretary of State in her grounds  of  application  for  permission  to
    appeal.  In particular, we find  this  at  paragraph  29:  "A  lack  of
    financial resources or an unwillingness to assume  care  responsibility
    would not, by itself, be sufficient for the  primary  carer  to  assert
    that another direct relative or  guardian  is  unable  to  care  for  a
    British citizen.  Caseworkers must start from the assumption that where
    there is another direct relative or legal guardian in the UK, that they
    can care for the British citizen unless there is sufficient evidence to
    the contrary".  As I  have  stated,  for  various  reasons,  I  am  not
    assisted by any further material or  submissions  in  determining  this
    matter.

7.   I fully accept the overall thrust of the Secretary  of  State's  point,
    which is that the test of whether the British citizen would  be  unable
    to live in the United Kingdom if the primary carer were to be  required
    to leave is a stringent one.  To require anything less would dilute the
    meaning of the Regulations.  However, since those Regulations were  put
    in place as a direct response to the judgment of the Court  of  Justice
    of  the  European  Union  in  the  case  of  Ruby  Zambrano   (European
    citizenship) [2011] EUECJ C-3409, it is important to bear in mind  that
    at paragraph 45 of the judgment in that case the European Court  states
    that "it must be assumed that such a refusal would lead to a  situation
    where those children citizens of the Union  would  have  to  leave  the
    territory of the Union in order  to  accompany  their  parents".   That
    assumption based on the evidence in the Zambrano case, makes  it  clear
    that the meaning  of  unable  to  reside  falls  to  be  determined  by
    reference to whether, if the primary carer were to  leave,  that  would
    mean that the British citizen child would also have to leave the United
    Kingdom and the more general territory of the European Union.  That  is
    precisely the wording used by the First-tier Tribunal Judge in the last
    sentence of paragraph 22 of her determination.  That test, as is  plain
    from Zambrano is one of fact.  It cannot be said that inability to live
    in the United Kingdom requires it to be shown that the British  citizen
    would legally have to leave.  On the contrary,  as  a  British  citizen
    child E has a right to reside in this country.  Furthermore, if child E
    were to be left without any parental means  of  support,  he  would  be
    looked after by relevant social services.  That, however,  cannot  mean
    that he is or would thereby be able to live in the United Kingdom  with
    the result that paragraph 15A(4A) could not be complied with.   Plainly
    the European Court was looking at the matter by reference   to  whether
    there would be people in a  parental  relationship  with  the  relevant
    child who could care for him if one of  the  parents  was  required  to
    leave.

8.   I note what is said in that regard  in  the  Caseworker  Directions  to
    which I have made reference.  Had those directions been in front of the
    judge they may have played some part in her  decision.   However,  they
    cannot be used at this stage in the proceedings in order to demonstrate
    that in making the findings of fact that  she  did  the  judge  somehow
    erred in law.  On the contrary, as  I  have  already  noted,  she  made
    positive credibility findings regarding the claimant's evidence.  Those
    credibility findings have not been challenged.  The judge's  conclusion
    was plainly that, as a matter of fact, if the claimant were required to
    leave the United Kingdom, then, in Zambrano terms, child E  would  have
    to go with her.

9.   In all the circumstances, bearing  in  mind  her  positive  credibility
    findings and notwithstanding that the father had  played  some  limited
    part in looking after the child in the past, I do not consider that the
    judge can be said to have reached a decision that was not open to  her.
    Accordingly, I find that on the facts of this case and bearing in  mind
    its procedural history, the Secretary of State has not shown  that  the
    determination contains an error of law such that I should set it aside.
     For this reason the appeal of  the  Secretary  of  State  against  the
    determination is dismissed.
