                                   Between

                                  ADNAN [A]

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. The appellant is a national of Iraq.  He has permission  to  appeal  to
    this Tribunal, granted by myself, following the setting  aside  by  the
    Court of Session of an earlier refusal of permission to appeal.

 2. Following the grant of permission, I directed the parties  to  indicate
    their views as to the  appropriate  way  forward.   I  noted  that  the
    grounds of appeal, as expanded in submissions made  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant, and subsequently amended, appeared to have merit.  They seek
    the setting aside of the First-tier Tribunal's decision  for  error  of
    law, and remittal for a fresh hearing; I indicated that my  provisional
    view was that that was what should be done.  In  response  Mr  Diwnycz,
    Senior Presenting Officer on behalf of the respondent, has  written  to
    say that he agrees.

 3. Having considered all the papers before me I set aside the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal for error of law as sufficiently identified  in
    the grounds of appeal to this Tribunal.  I remit the appellant's appeal
    for consideration afresh by the First-tier Tribunal.

                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
