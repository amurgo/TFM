Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr M Adophy, Saintta International Lawyers UK
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by joint Appellants Shuying Liu and her son.  They
    applied to enter the UK as the spouse and child of the Sponsor.  The
    application was refused and they appealed.  The basis of the refusal
    was that they did not meet the Immigration Rules and there was no
    evidence that they were married or that their relationship met the
    requirements of Appendix FM.  A decision was reserved with regard to
    the maintenance requirements under the rules and in the outcome in the
    Court of Appeal of the case of MM.

 2. The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Wright sitting at
    Hatton Cross on the 17th March this year.  In a decision promulgated on
    the 1st April 2015 he dismissed the appeal.  The findings were that
    there was no evidence that the parties were married and there was no
    evidence that they had cohabited.  Following the departure of the
    Sponsor in 2001 there is only evidence of a two week visit in 2013 and
    it was also found with regard to maintenance that not only had the
    Sponsor not provided the specified evidence required to prove
    maintenance but that the P60s which had been produced late in the day
    were not in fact reliable.

 3. In any event the combined total shown on the P60s showed combined
    earnings of �22,040 which is short of the �22,400 required to meet the
    requirements of Appendix FM with regard to maintenance for one adult
    and one child.

 4. The Appellants sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in
    grounds which made three points.  The first was that the finding that
    the relationship requirements had not been met.  This was dealt with at
    paragraph 18 of the decision and it was suggested that the Judge had
    erred with regard to the evidence and the assessment that had been
    made.  The second ground was that the finding that the P60s were not
    reliable documents and that that had not been put to the Sponsor.
    Thirdly it was stated that the First-tier Judge errs as a matter of law
    in respect of his article 8 assessment, "FtT fails to explain
    sufficiently how the Immigration Rules in this instance amount to a
    complete code", and it was then suggested that he erred in his public
    interest assessment with regard to article 8.

 5. The application was considered by Judge Levin, who in his decision of
    the 19th May rejected the complaints made in relation to the
    relationship and Appendix FM-SE but found that it was arguable that the
    Judge's finding at paragraph 27 that the rules provided a complete code
    was wrong as the Judge had accepted that the Sponsor was the second
    Appellant's father.  Permission therefore was granted on the third
    ground only.

 6. That ground does not reflect what was said by the Judge at paragraph 27
    of his decision, which I will now quote in full:

         "In the case of the other/second Appellant it could be argued that
         article 8 is engaged because it is not disputed that he is the
         Sponsor's son and because he failed to meet the relevant
         relationship requirements of the rules simply due to his mother's
         failure under the same.  However, I do not actually consider that
         there are compelling circumstances here not sufficiently recognised
         under the rules or, put another way (see paragraph 17 of Sabir
         (Appendix FM - EX.1 not free standing) [2014] UKUT 00063 [Coker
         UTJ], that refusal of the second Appellant's application results in
         unjustifiably harsh consequences such as to be disproportionate
         under article 8 (applying the five stage Razgar test concluding
         with the proportionality balancing exercise and answering the first
         four questions in the affirmative with the public interest in
         maintaining effective immigration control being as strong as usual
         and having regard, as I must, to the relevant public interest
         considerations in the new section 117B of the 2002 Act as amended
         on the 28th July 2014 in the light of Dube and seeking to strike a
         fair balance as I must pursuant to section 6 of the Human Rights
         Act 1998 and in so doing taking into account here the recent case
         of Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance cases) in the light of the
         financial requirements of the rules remaining unmet, the Sponsor
         and the second Appellant having lived apart since July 2001 even on
         the Sponsor's own account when the Sponsor came to the UK except
         for the period of the Sponsor's short visit in 2013 of two weeks,
         the availability of modern means of communication as well as
         possible further visits to the second Appellant and the complete
         lack of any emotional dependency."

 7. It is clear from that paragraph that the Judge did not consider that
    the rules were a complete code.  Having considered all of the
    circumstances and having summarised them again in the paragraph I have
    just quoted it is clear that he found that the circumstances of the
    Appellants were not such that they were sufficiently compelling to be
    considered independently under article 8.

 8. In any event the Appellants could not show that they met the financial
    requirements. Those have to form a fundamental consideration with
    regard to the public interest given the public interest in the
    maintenance of the economic wellbeing of the UK as set out in the
    Immigration Rules and in particular Appendix FM.

 9. Given the length of time that the parties had chosen to live apart and
    the lack of funds he was entitled to find that there was no breach of
    article 8.  I am not persuaded that there were any compelling
    circumstances or that he was wrong to find that that was the case but
    the lack of required maintenance is fundamental.  Article 8 is not a
    standalone alternative to the Immigration Rules.  It is certainly not a
    bypass and it is to be assessed where relevant against the background
    of the rules.

10. I note here that there is a clear difference between being in a
    situation not contemplated by the Immigration Rules and simply failing
    to meet them.  It is the case here that the Appellants fail to meet
    them.  There being no near miss principle applicable, there is nothing
    remotely compelling about the circumstances when as I have noted they
    have chosen to live apart now for the best part of fourteen years with
    a two week exception two years ago.

11. I note that at the start of the hearing Mr Adophy informed me that
    there was now evidence of the registration of their marriage.  So far
    as this hearing is concerned that is not legally relevant as it does
    not go to show that the Judge erred in any way. The decision that he
    made was on the evidence presented to him which, it is accepted, did
    not include evidence to show that there was a legal marriage.

12. The evidence referred to by Mr Balroop can form the basis for a renewed
    application along with any other evidence to show that the marriage is
    genuine and subsisting and along with specified evidence which would
    show that the applicant meets the Immigration Rules in all other
    aspects.

NOTICE OF DECISION

In those circumstances I am satisfied that there was no error and if
anything the grant of permission to the Upper Tribunal was generous.  For
the reasons given the appeals are dismissed and the decision of the First-
tier Tribunal shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
