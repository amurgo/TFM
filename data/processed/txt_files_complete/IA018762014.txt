                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria. She appeals with leave  against
    the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Seelhoff  dismissing  her
    appeal against the respondent's decision  to  deprive  her  of  British
    citizenship. Under the British Nationality Act 1981, she had a right of
    appeal. However, the decision to deprive  her  has,  as  noted  by  the
    Judge, no effect.

    The background to the appeal

 2. The appellant came to the UK in October 2002 and  applied  for  asylum.
    That was  initially  refused  in  October  2002  but  she  successfully
    appealed that decision and was granted refugee  status  on  14  January
    2004 with indefinite leave to remain.

 3. She application for British citizenship made on 22  October  2007,  was
    granted on 3 January 2008.

 4. On 10 August 2008, she was convicted of  various  counts  of  tendering
    counterfeit currency and possessing false currency. She  was  sentenced
    to 18 months in prison on each count to run concurrently.

 5. On 6 September 2011 she was arrested and  charged  with  conspiracy  to
    facilitate and conspiracy to obtain benefits. On 1  November  2012  she
    was convicted for conspiracy to defraud  and  was  sentenced  to  three
    years  in  prison.  It  had  been  contended  in  the  course  of   the
    investigation that evidence came  to  light  confirming  that  she  had
    committed benefit fraud between 2004 and 2012 as  well  as  immigration
    fraud.

 6. The appellant was one of five persons convicted and sentenced  as  part
    of the same proceedings on 1 November 2012. Judge  Ainley's  sentencing
    remarks revealed that the  ringleader  of  the  fraud  obtained  status
    documents in a number of different identities and  falsely  claimed  to
    have children when she claimed asylum, including one whom she said  was
    called "Betty Natimba." The Judge recorded that identity documents were
    obtained in the name of Betty Natimba, despite the fact  that  she  had
    never existed [6].

 7. Judge Ainley found that the  fraud  as  a  whole  included  claims  for
    benefits to the tune of about half a million pounds, medication costing
    about �2 million, education costing several hundred thousand pounds and
    obtaining in excess of �650,000 through illegally subletting flats.  It
    is also recorded that a further �450,000 of fraudulent claims were made
    by other people using identities obtained  by  the  ringleader  of  the
    fraud.

 8. The appellant was the fourth person sentenced at  the  same  sentencing
    hearing, and the sentencing remarks confirmed that whilst the appellant
    had nothing to do  with  the  conspiracy  at  its  outset,  she  became
    involved from at least 2008 when she was using  documents  in  a  false
    identity. The sentencing remarks confirmed that she was  working  on  a
    day to day basis using the Betty identity  so  she  could  fraudulently
    claim benefits in her own name.

 9. In sentencing her, the Judge noted that  she  had  persisted  in  lying
    about her conduct throughout the proceedings. Her  claim  to  be  Betty
    Natimba was obviously dishonest. ".....Here again we had to  listen  to
    increasingly threadbare  lies  told  by  you  as  to  why  the  obvious
    conclusion that you were Betty Natimba was wrong. I pay no heed to that
    - nor I am sure did the jury."

10.  The  Judge  noted  that  she  specifically  attached  herself  to   an
    immigration  fraud  which  constituted  an  aggravating   feature   and
    concluded that the least sentence he could pass on her was one of three
    years in prison. The  Judge  also  made  reference  in  his  sentencing
    remarks to the two previous convictions.

11. On 11 December 2013 the respondent  gave  notice  of  her  decision  to
    deprive the appellant of  her  citizenship  under  section  40  of  the
    British Nationality Act 1981.  It was contended that she  obtained  her
    status as a British Citizen fraudulently.

12. The respondent also contended that from  evidence  received  from  2004
    from the Department of Work and  Pensions  and  its  own  investigating
    team, that the appellant claimed Incapacity  Benefit  from  2004  until
    2012. In the benefit form she claimed  she  was  so  incapacitated  she
    could hardly move. She had assumed the identity of  Betty  Natimba  and
    was responsible for an NTL application in  that  name  on  17  November
    2005.  Those were all matters that she concealed and failed to disclose
    when she applied for British citizenship at  the  end  of  2007.  As  a
    result it was appropriate to deprive her of  citizenship  as  she  must
    have made false assertions of good character [10].

13. She was informed of her right to appeal and was told that  if  she  did
    not appeal or the appeal is unsuccessful, the respondent would formally
    deprive her of British Citizenship by Deprivation  Order,  whereby  she
    will lose her status of British citizenship and the  associated  rights
    and benefits - paragraphs 11 and 12 of the notice of decision.

14. The decision  letter  considered  the  impact  of  the  deprivation  of
    citizenship, noting that she is no longer  a  recognised  refugee,  but
    stated that there was no immediate intention to remove her and  that  a
    separate removal decision would be made  should  the  appeal  fail,  at
    which stage she would be able to raise human rights grounds in  respect
    of any removal decision.

15. The appellant appealed the decision, denying in her  grounds  that  she
    had ever used  the  identity  of  Betty  Natimba,  asserting  that  the
    decision to  deprive  her  of  British  citizenship  would  breach  the
    respondent's Article 8 obligations.

16. Judge Seelhoff noted [15] that the  respondent  had  indicated  in  the
    decision that there would be a separate removal process for her removal
    from the UK, which would entail considerations of her Article 8 rights.
    The respondent would be required to consider her claim to be a  refugee
    afresh before she could be removed.

17. He noted that there was  some  difficulty  in  obtaining  many  of  the
    historic documents in this case. Some  of  the  allegations  about  the
    appellant's conduct resulted only in sparse material being supplied.  A
    fraud  officer's  statement,  which  was  commended  in   the   Judge's
    sentencing remarks, was  poorly  drafted  and  unsupported  by  further
    evidence  confirming  the  allegations  made  therein.  That   document
    recorded that the appellant claimed benefits between 2004 and 2012 with
    the only gap being the five months she spent in  prison  in  connection
    with the false currency issue.

18. It was  noted  that  the  appellant's  naturalisation  application  was
    countersigned by Tessi Busulwa, which was one of the  false  identities
    of the ringleader of the fraud, whose reference on the form stated that
    she had known the appellant for five years.

19. Accordingly, it was asserted that the appellant  must  have  known  the
    ringleader from 2004 and had been  actively  involved  with  the  fraud
    throughout  that  time.  It  is  alleged  that  the  appellant  made  a
    fraudulent claim totalling �100,000 in her own right. Further,  it  was
    asserted that there was some fraudulent detail relating to  her  asylum
    claim as there was no evidence of her ever having  sent  money  to  the
    sons she claimed to have had when she arrived  in  the  UK.  There  was
    evidence of her sending money to her brother and mother [22].

20. Judge Seelhofff noted that from the bundle of evidence  served  by  the
    appellant, there was her statement where she denied involvement in  any
    of the frauds or the matters which led  to  her  conviction.  She  also
    claimed she had been suffering from depression and had been  trying  to
    locate "her children" (plural) in Uganda. She denied working in any  of
    the false identities including ever having  used  "Betty  Natimba",  or
    having  ever  done  anything  wrong  [24].   He  had  regard   to   the
    difficulties  raised  with  regard  to  the  production   of   historic
    documents.

21. The witness statement of the appellant is short (pages 1-5).  She  made
    her application for British citizenship in her name. It was granted  to
    her in her name. The assertion that  she  was  not  a  person  of  good
    character when she obtained British citizenship is incorrect.

22. She acknowledges that she was convicted of the offence of conspiracy to
    defraud on 1 November 2012, for which she was sentenced to three years'
    imprisonment.

23. She only served 18 months and has repaid her burden to society. She  is
    very sorry for her actions  that  led  to  her  being  in  prison  "and
    continue to try to show that  I  have  changed  for  the  better  as  a
    person." She has applied to work as a voluntary worker with a  charity.
    It would be unfair and unjust if she were punished again  for  a  crime
    that she was convicted of. She has never gone back to Uganda since  she
    came here and has no family or friends to return to there.

24. The current government of Uganda is the same government that persecuted
    her because of her husband's political  opinion.  Returning  her  there
    would deprive her of her liberty and would lead to her  being  tortured
    or killed in breach of her human rights.

25. Her grounds of appeal before the First-tier Tribunal contended that the
    decision to deprive her of British citizenship is an abuse of the  UK's
    obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights having regard
    to her private life under Article 8. Her  removal  would  therefore  be
    unlawful.  She also denied that she was ever known as "Betty  Natimba."
    She denied having claimed benefits in that name.

26. She did not assert in her grounds that the deprivation would result  in
    her becoming stateless.   Nor  was  any  such  assertion  made  in  her
    witness statement

27. Judge Seelhoff directed himself in accordance with the Upper Tribunal's
    decision in Deliallisi (British  citizen:  Deprivation  appeal:  Scope)
    [2013] (IAC) [14]. He noted  that  the  respondent  envisaged  '......a
    separate removal process for the appellant is   removed  from  the  UK"
    (sic) at which stage her human rights would be considered  as  well  as
    her claim to be a refugee [15].

28. In his findings, he stated that the task for him was to reconsider  the
    decision and decide whether or not it is correct, taking  into  account
    all the circumstances and the evidence. He stated that he has  reviewed
    the papers as well as reading  the  authorities  he  was  referred  to.
    Contrary to the presenting officer's  contention  before  him  that  he
    should  disregard  Deliallisi,  which  was  "not  a  well  thought  out
    judgment" [30] the Judge found that he was bound by that  authority  in
    terms of the approach that he took to his analysis [33].

29. The starting point was a consideration of the  appellant's  convictions
    and the findings of the sentencing Judge and his remarks. This  was  to
    be treated as a definitive record of the appellant's criminal  history.
    The sentencing Judge had found that she had been part of  an  extensive
    fraud and her involvement was  so  serious  that  he  felt  he  had  no
    alternative but to impose a sentence of three years'  imprisonment.  He
    also  found  that  she  was  a  persistent   liar   who   accepted   no
    responsibility for her actions.

30. Judge Seelhoff noted that although he had no details  of  her  previous
    convictions  beyond  knowing  that  they  were  for  possessing   false
    currency, she received a sentence of 18 months in prison for her  first
    offences which meant that it "must have been a serious matter" [35]. He
    stated that the appellant is someone who has made a living  from  crime
    and who has persisted in her lies about her offending before him as she
    specifically denied any involvement in the criminal matters  for  which
    she had been found guilty by a jury. He  accordingly  attached  minimal
    weight to anything she said denying  responsibility  for  her  criminal
    conduct [35].

31. There were other details in her recent statements that he referred  to,
    including the claim that she  had  spent  time  trying  to  locate  her
    children (plural) in Uganda whereas in her original asylum  claim,  she
    stated she only had one son. Further,  it  was  evident  from  the  DWP
    report that no evidence was found of her sending  money  to  a  son  in
    Uganda, 'suggesting that none existed' [36].

32.  He  further  noted  [37]  that   the   appellant's   application   for
    naturalisation was countersigned by Tessie Bosulwa, which  was  alleged
    to be a false identity  used  by  the  ringleader  of  the  fraud.  Her
    naturalisation application form confirmed that it was countersigned  by
    "Tessie Bosulwa" who stated that she had known the appellant  for  five
    years. The sentencing remarks in  respect  of  the  ringleader  of  the
    offence confirmed that Tessie Bosulwa was a  false  identity  that  was
    being used by that person from 1997.

33. The appellant had not answered the contention  made  in  the  statement
    from Sarah Braker the fraud officer at the DWP who had drafted it.

34. Judge Seelhoff found on the balance of probabilities that the reference
    from Tessie Bosulwa on the appellant's application  for  naturalisation
    was "a false one" [37].  He decided  not to reconvene  the  hearing  to
    address 'this point' as it was plain from the papers that the appellant
    is an habitual liar and he would not attach any weight to anything  she
    might offer by way of explanation and it would not take  the  case  any
    further [38].

35. The application for naturalisation was therefore evidence that she  had
    been involved with and trusted the  person  using  the  Tessie  Bosulwa
    identity for five  years  as  of  2007.  That  declaration  linked  the
    appellant to a fraudster back as far as 2002, suggesting that she would
    have known that person at  the  time  the  NTL  application  for  Betty
    Natimba was lodged. He accepted that the  Betty  Natimba  identity  was
    used by more than one person.  That  did  not  take  him  very  far  in
    exonerating the appellant from using that identity as she had documents
    in her name and was found to have used that identity in her trial.

36. Judge Seelhoff had regard to the sentencing Judge's  finding  that  her
    involvement with the fraud for at least one  of  the  identities  dated
    from "2008 at the latest". He considered it likely that her involvement
    pre-dated that date [41].

37. He was thus satisfied on the balance of probabilities that  some  false
    representations  were  made  in  respect   of   the   application   for
    naturalisation and that material facts were concealed when she asserted
    that she was of good character despite the gaps in the evidence  served
    by the respondent.

38.  Judge  Seelhoff  also  had  regard  to  the  other  justification  for
    deprivation of citizenship namely that it was in the  public  interest.
    He noted that the appellant had  a  very  poor  criminal  history.  She
    received a prison sentence of 18 months on one occasion and three years
    on another. He had regard to the provisions in  a  deportation  context
    with regard to Article 8. Whilst the appellant was  technically  not  a
    foreign criminal it could be inferred from the  deportation  provisions
    and others that there is a significant public interest in  the  removal
    of persons who have another nationality and who have a serious criminal
    record. She had shown no remorse for her crimes [44].

39. There are other factors weighing against  deprivation  of  citizenship,
    which he considered [45]. She is a former refugee. Although it would be
    "inappropriate" to conclude that she still is a refugee, there may well
    still be some danger to her in being sent back to Uganda. Against that,
    she had no sign of integrating in the UK. There was  no  evidence  that
    she had  ever  lawfully  worked  here.  The  criminal  behaviour  is  a
    significant indicator  that  she  rejects  the  lawful  norms  of  this
    society.

40. He had regard to the effect of cancelling British citizenship,  thereby
    denying her the benefits of European citizenship and her right to  live
    anywhere in Europe. There was however nothing before him to  show  that
    she  has  ever  travelled  to  Europe  and  unlike  the  appellants  in
    Deliallisi, supra, she had  no  wider  family  members  who  also  held
    British passports who  would  be  "....impacted  as  a  result  of  her
    inability to travel round Europe" [45].

41. In considering the consequences to the appellant of losing her right as
    a European citizen, he had regard to the public interest of "the  wider
    citizens of Europe as well as those of the UK". The European  interests
    are likely to  mirror  those  of  the  UK  when  depriving  someone  of
    citizenship where they are a repeat fraudster.

42. This was a different case from Deliallisi, where  the  appellant  there
    obtained his status in a false identity but subsequently lived a lawful
    life paying taxes and contributing to the UK.  Here this appellant  had
    actually done significant harm to the UK with her  involvement  in  the
    fraud that secured several million pounds of improper earnings, a large
    portion of which was from the public  purse.  There  was  therefore  an
    important deterrent value involved. [46]

43. Judge Seelhoff considered the medical  evidence,  noting  that  she  is
    suffering from depression and is receiving treatment. The papers at the
    highest disclosed tuberculosis, depression, some symptoms of  PTSD  and
    some suicidal ideation. Deprivation of  citizenship  is  likely  to  be
    detrimental to her mental health. However,  he  found  that  it  is  an
    entirely appropriate step, given the scale of her criminal conduct;  it
    is one that he found to be reasonable and  proportionate,  particularly
    given the respondent's "agreement" to give her a fresh right of  appeal
    against any decision to remove or deport her [47].

44. Her removal from the UK is a foreseeable consequence  of  the  decision
    but not directly  foreseeable  as  the  respondent  had  undertaken  to
    conduct a full review of the Human Rights prior to any removal. [49] He
    however could not exclude the possibility that her deceit  extended  to
    the earlier asylum claim which would need  to  be  comprehensively  re-
    examined before any steps are taken to remove her.

45. Despite significant gaps in  the  evidence  before  him  regarding  the
    asylum claim, and in respect  of  the  "specifics  of  the  fraud"  his
    overall assessment was that the criminal conduct in this case was  very
    serious  and  was  aggravated  by  her  continuing  denial  of   guilt.
    Accordingly, the only rational decision would be to deprive her of  her
    citizenship. It would be wholly inappropriate  to  interfere  with  the
    respondent's decision on this occasion [50].

    The appeal before the Upper Tribunal

46. The appellant was given permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew. In  his  decision  dated  2  December
    2014, he noted that the grounds  complained  that  the  Judge  did  not
    consider whether the appellant  would  become  stateless  if  she  were
    deprived of her  British  citizenship.  That  failure  amounted  to  an
    arguable error of law.

47. In the grounds relied on in the application for permission  to  appeal,
    it was specifically contended (paragraph 5) that  the  Immigration  Act
    2014 states that the Home Secretary must have  reasonable  grounds  for
    believing the appellant  is  able  to  become  a  national  of  another
    country. The grounds, which are drawn in the  first  person,  contended
    that the government of President Museevani "from  whom  I  was  running
    away" and in respect of which she was granted full refugee  status,  is
    still in power. The Judge therefore erred in law as she  is  unable  to
    become a citizen of Uganda again and would be stateless if she lost her
    British citizenship.

48. As already noted, no evidence either  factual  or  legal  was  produced
    before the First-tier Tribunal regarding that contention. The appellant
    had not even relied on that contention as a ground of appeal before the
    First-tier Tribunal.

49. At the hearing on 13 January 2015, Mr Asiimwe submitted that the  Judge
    had  not  properly  explained  that  if  the  citizenship  were  to  be
    "withdrawn" the logical next step must be to  remove  her.  Not  enough
    attention had been given as  to  what  she  would  be  left  with  once
    citizenship is deprived. No regard was had  as  to  whether  she  would
    become stateless if deprived of her British citizenship.

50. There are also other unmeritorious contentions, some of which  are  set
    out below, but which were not pursued at the hearing.

51. The Judge had breached the Limitation Act 1980 and tried to re-open her
    case ten years and eight months after it had been heard  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal. The Judge was therefore biased. The Judge was  also  "abusing
    his powers." The Judge did not mention that she  provided  evidence  to
    the court regarding  the  identity  of  the  real  Betty  Natimba.  She
    repeated that this is evidence of his bias.

52. She contended that the Judge had breached her  Article  3  rights.  The
    Judge recognised and accepted that her life may be at risk if  returned
    to Uganda [45] but the Judge is "still advocating for me to be returned
    to Uganda in paragraph 46." That shows his bias towards her.

53. The Judge also breached the provisions of the Disability Discrimination
    Act 1995 when he stated that in order to be able to attach  significant
    weight to evidence from doctors as to the appellant's psychiatric  well
    being, he would want to be  confident  that  they  were  aware  of  the
    appellant's history  of  sophisticated  fraud  which  included  benefit
    fraud, which could entail deceiving medical professionals. That  showed
    bias as well.

54. Mr Asiimwe submitted that the  appellant  had  "paid  for  the  offence
    committed." The "balance of convenience"  is  in  her  favour.  She  is
    likely to lose her life if returned to Uganda.

55. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Bramble submitted that the decision was
    in accordance with the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  Deliallisi,
    supra.  He  referred  to  the  distinction  between  the  appellant  in
    Deliallisi and the current appellant as noted by Judge Seelhofff.

56. He submitted that the question is how far the Judge  needed  to  assess
    the risk on return. These are matters that 'at  the  end  of  the  day,
    might have to be taken into account by the respondent should her appeal
    fail'. Removal would not be imminent.

    Assessment

57. Although there were various grounds raised  by  the  appellant  in  her
    application for permission, most of these related to  allegations  that
    the Judge was biased, or that the material was sparse.

58. However, the Judge has given ample consideration to  those  contentions
    and has given proper reasons why he was satisfied  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that some false representations had been made in  respect
    of the application for naturalisation, namely that material facts  were
    concealed when the appellant asserted that she was of  good  character.
    That finding was made notwithstanding the gaps in  evidence  served  by
    the respondent in that regard. He found that it had  been  proved  that
    there was deception used by the appellant.

59. In any event, he had regard to a further justification for  deprivation
    of citizenship, which was in the public interest, and that was her very
    poor criminal history. She had received prison sentences of  18  months
    on  one  occasion  and  three  years  on  another.  There  was  thus  a
    significant public interest in the removal of persons who have  another
    nationality and who have a  serious  criminal  record.  This  appellant
    showed no remorse for her crimes.

60. The Judge also noted factors which weighed against the  deprivation  of
    citizenship. One of those was that she was a former refugee. Whilst  he
    found it inappropriate to conclude that she is still a  refugee,  there
    may still be danger to her in being sent to Uganda [45].

61. Nor was there any evidence that she had ever lawfully worked in the UK.
    He had regard to the effect  on  her  of  cancelling  the  benefits  of
    European citizenship. However, there was nothing to show that  she  had
    ever travelled to Europe and did not have wider family members who also
    hold British passports who would be affected by her inability to travel
    around Europe.

62. He noted that unlike the appellant in Deliallisi,  this  appellant  had
    actually 'done significant  harm'  to  the  UK  having  regard  to  her
    involvement in a fraud which secured several million pounds of improper
    earnings. A large portion came from the public purse.

63. He also noted that her removal is  a  foreseeable  consequence  of  the
    decision but not directly foreseeable as the respondent  still  has  to
    conduct a full review of the human rights claim prior to any removal.

64. I have had regard to the decision in Deliallisi, supra. An appeal under
    s.40A of the British Nationality Act 1981 against a decision to deprive
    a person of British  citizenship  requires  the  Tribunal  to  consider
    whether the secretary of  state's  discretionary  decision  to  deprive
    should be exercised differently. This will involve (but not be  limited
    to) ECHR Article 8 issues as well as the question  whether  deprivation
    would be a disproportionate interference with a person's EU rights.

65. Although  s.40A  of  the  1981  Act  does  not  involve  any  statutory
    hypothesis  that  the  appellant  will  be  removed  from  the  UK   in
    consequence of the deprivation decision, the Tribunal  is  required  to
    determine the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deprivation, which
    may, depending on the facts, include removal.

66. The Tribunal also noted that a person who, immediately before  becoming
    a British citizen, had indefinite leave to remain in the UK,  does  not
    automatically become entitled to such leave,  upon  being  deprived  of
    such citizenship.

67. Judge Seelhoff found that her removal from the  UK  was  a  foreseeable
    consequence of this decision, albeit not  directly.  The  appellant  in
    Deliallisi had been in gainful employment for almost all  the  time  in
    this country. He supported his British wife and  two  British  children
    who lived with him in West  London.  In  those  circumstances,  it  was
    extremely unlikely that removal action would be initiated.  Apart  from
    the significant dishonesty he displayed in claiming to come from Kosovo
    there was no suggestion that he was otherwise of bad character.

68. I have also had regard to  the  decision  referred  to  in  Deliallisi,
    namely, Rottmann v Freistaat Bayers [2010] EUECJ  C  135/08  (02  March
    2010).

69. In the latter case, a citizen of Austria exercised free movement rights
    to settle in Germany. He obtained naturalisation  in  Germany.  It  was
    discovered  that  he  failed  to  disclose  in  connection   with   his
    application that he was subject to criminal investigations in  Austria.
    The German authorities took steps to withdraw his  German  nationality.
    Upon becoming naturalised  in  Germany,  he  had  lost  citizenship  of
    Austria, pursuant to the nationality laws of that country.

70. The CJEU held [57] that a  Member  State  whose  nationality  had  been
    acquired by deception cannot be considered bound, pursuant  to  Article
    17EC, to refrain from withdrawing  naturalisation  merely  because  the
    person concerned had not recovered the nationality of his Member  State
    of origin.

71. It was nevertheless for the national court to determine whether, before
    such a decision withdrawing naturalisation takes effect, having  regard
    to all the relevant circumstances,  observance  of  the  principles  of
    proportionality  requires  the  person  concerned  to  be  afforded   a
    reasonable period of time in order to try to recover the nationality of
    his Member State of origin [58].

72. The appellant has  given  no  evidence  either  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal as to whether, on  becoming  naturalised
    in Britain, she lost citizenship of Uganda pursuant to any  nationality
    laws of that country.

73. In any event, it is evident that  the  respondent  has  not  taken  any
    decision relating to her removal.

74. The respondent referred to paragraph 339A of the immigration rules that
    a person's grant of asylum will  be  revoked  or  not  renewed  if  the
    secretary of state is satisfied that he has acquired a new  nationality
    and enjoys the protection of the country of  his  new  nationality.  On
    that basis, it was pointed out  to  her  that  on  becoming  a  British
    citizen, she ceased to be a refugee in the UK. That remains the case if
    she is deprived of her British citizenship and she will not be able  to
    apply to reinstate her previous status as a refugee in the UK.

75. Nevertheless, she was informed that it will still be  open  to  her  to
    make a claim in relation to any breach of her human  rights,  including
    her right to respect for private and family life under Article  8  ECHR
    which arises as a result of the decision to remove her from the  UK  at
    the time the deprivation order depriving her of her British citizenship
    was made.

76. It is noted - paragraph 14 - that following the decision to remove,  if
    made, and any appeal against the decision to  remove  being  dismissed,
    removal directions will then be issued in her name in  accordance  with
    s.10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

77. In the  circumstances,  in  the  event  that  the  appellant  has  lost
    citizenship of Uganda pursuant to its nationality laws,  observance  of
    the principle of  proportionality  requires  that  she  be  afforded  a
    reasonable period of time in order to try to recover the nationality of
    that state.

78. It is envisaged therefore that prior to a  decision  on  removal  being
    made, the appellant will be afforded a proper opportunity, if  that  is
    indeed the effect of Ugandan nationality laws, to try  to  recover  her
    nationality there. These, and other human rights claims, will  be  open
    to the appellant to make following a decision to remove her from the UK
    at the  time  the  deprivation  order  depriving  her  of  her  British
    citizenship is made. She will also have an appeal following a  decision
    to remove her.

79. In the circumstances, I find that the Judge has  properly  reconsidered
    the  respondent's  decision  and  has   reviewed   the   evidence   and
    documentation before  him.   He  has  carefully  assessed  the  factors
    weighing both for and against the appellant regarding  the  deprivation
    of citizenship. The making of the decision did not involve  the  making
    of any material error on a point of law.

    Notice of Decision

    The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

    No anonymity direction is made.
