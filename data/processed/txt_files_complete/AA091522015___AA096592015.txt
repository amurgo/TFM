Anonymity

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a
Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any form of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the appellants.
This direction applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any failure to
comply with this direction could give rise to contempt of court
proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This appeal arises from the decision of the respondent to refuse the
   appellants' application for asylum or humanitarian protection and the
   subsequent dismissal of their appeal by First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") Judge
   Oakley.


2. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan. The first appellant was born on
   31 December 1979 and the second appellant, his mother, was born on 1
   January 1950. Both appellants claim to fear persecution in Pakistan
   because they are Ahmadi Muslims.

3. The first appellant's case, in summary, is that he has served, and been
   heavily involved in, the Ahmadi community in Pakistan, his late father
   having been president of the local area. He claims that in December 2014
   two mullahs vandalised his family's shop (which they have owned since
   1999). He reported the matter to the police but no action was taken. He
   and his mother were concerned and therefore travelled to the UK whereupon
   they claimed asylum. His wife and children remain in Pakistan and live
   with his wife's parents.

4. The second appellant claimed to have suffered harassment as a
   consequence of being Ahmadi, although she was never subject to physical
   assault.

5. The respondent refused the asylum claims and the appellants appealed. In
   dismissing their appeal, the FtT made a number of findings, which include
   the following:

   a. Neither of the appellants had any particular problems until the
      incident in the shop occurred.
   b. They had both been living in the house of the second appellant's
      brother.
   c. The first appellant operated a shop for about fifteen years without
      harassment or attack.
   d. In December 2014 the shop was attacked as described by the appellants
      and the incident was reported to the police.
   e. The first appellant left his wife and children in Pakistan, where they
      have not faced problems.
   f. The shop continues to be operated. It is overseen by the first
      appellant's brother but is operated by a non Ahmadi.
   g. The second appellant has experienced no personal attacks although she
      has experienced harassment and taunts.

6. The FtT's consideration of the religious beliefs and practices of the
   first appellant is set out in paragraphs [50] and [51] of the decision.
   At paragraph [50] the FtT stated that it was "clear" he did not preach
   openly in Pakistan and that "he clearly indicates that any preaching was
   only done discreetly." The FtT also stated that the first appellant
   confirmed that "whilst he continued to preach in the UK, he would always
   refer any persons for possible conversion to the professionals and his
   activities in relation to that were more limited." The FtT found, at
   paragraph [51], that whilst the first appellant regularly attends Ahmadi
   events in the UK, there is no evidence "that he has any particular
   responsibility for preaching and conversion".

7. The decision does not include any consideration of the second
   appellant's religious beliefs and activities.

8. At paragraph [52] the FtT concluded that the first appellant falls into
   category 2(ii) of the headnote in MN and Others (Ahamdis- country
   guidance - risk) Pakistan CG [2012] UKUT 00389. No specific finding in
   respect of whether the second appellant falls into this category is made.



Grounds of appeal and submissions

9. The appellants' grounds of appeal are lengthy and were helpfully
   summarised by Mr Fripp who, in his submissions, articulated four distinct
   grounds.

10. The first ground is that the FtT erred in respect of the standard of
   proof by applying the higher civil standard rather than the lower
   standard of proof required in asylum appeals. Although at paragraph [10],
   under the sub heading "burden and standard of proof," the FtT directed
   itself as to the correct standard, in the substance of the decision, at
   paragraphs [36] and [39], the FtT made a finding that the event the first
   appellant described "is likely more than not to have taken place." Mr
   Fripp submitted that there are no other references to the standard and
   the implication is that the judge in practice applied the wrong standard
   throughout the decision.

11. The second ground of appeal, as submitted by Mr Fripp at the hearing
   before me, is that the FtT failed to take into account the discrimination
   the appellants have faced, over many years, as Ahmadis, in making a
   finding that they had not faced any real problems until the incident at
   the shop in 2014.

12. The third ground concerns the FtT's findings, at paragraphs [39] and
   [40], about the reporting of the incident at the shop to the police. The
   FtT stated at paragraph [39] that "it does not appear that the matter has
   been pressed by those reporting the matter and it is perhaps a result of
   that fact that the police took no action." At paragraph [40] it then
   stated that the Country Guidance shows that in general a person can
   access effective protection "but in this case it appears for reasons
   known to themselves that the matter was not pressed further with the
   police". Mr Fripp argued that this is contrary to MN, the findings of
   which highlight why protection would not be available for the appellants
   and why they would not necessarily wish to press the matter with the
   police. He also submitted that the FtT's comment about the police not
   taking action because the matter was not pressed is merely speculation.

13. The fourth ground is that the FtT has failed to follow MN by focussing
   on preaching by the appellants. No reason other than the absence of
   preaching is given for the FtT's conclusion that protection is not
   required. However, the risk to Ahmadis identified in MN is not limited to
   individuals who preach and the question the FtT should have considered is
   whether it is of particular importance to the appellants' religious
   identity to practice their faith openly. Moreover, the FtT, having
   acknowledged that the first appellant claimed he preached discreetly in
   Pakistan, failed to consider whether that was a result of the fear he
   faced. In respect of the second appellant, Mr Fripp submitted that the
   FtT failed to explore whether the absence of open expression of her faith
   in Pakistan was a result of the climate of fear.

14. Mrs Sreeraman argued, firstly, that the FtT had properly directed
   itself and applied the correct burden of proof. In any event, the
   findings where a higher standard had been applied were favourable to the
   appellant.

15. Secondly, with regard to MN and risk on return, Mrs Sreeraman argued
   the FtT explained, in clear terms, why the appellants would not face risk
   of persecution and in so doing engaged properly with the applicable
   Country Guidance. The burden was on the appellants to show they fall into
   category 2(i) of the headnote to MN and they have failed to meet that
   burden even to the lower standard in asylum cases.  She argued that the
   evidence before the FtT was consistent with a finding that the appellants
   could practice their religion upon return without infringing Pakistan law
   and that they did not have a genuine intention to practice their faith as
   described in category 2(i).

Consideration

16. I do not accept that the FtT has made an error in respect of the
   standard of proof it adopted in determining the risk the appellants would
   face on return to the Pakistan.

17. As noted by Mr Fripp, at paragraphs [36] and [39], the FtT applied the
   civil standard of proof (more likely than not), rather than the lower
   standard applicable in asylum claims (reasonable degree of likelihood) in
   respect of its finding as to whether the incident at the appellant's shop
   took place.

18. Whilst the ultimate question for the FtT was whether there was a "real
   risk" or a "reasonable degree of likelihood" of the appellants being at
   risk on return to Pakistan (ie the lower standard in asylum appeals) that
   does not mean it could not apply different levels of proof to particular
   factual findings when evaluating the evidence and find that certain
   events were "more likely than not" to have occurred. As explained in SR
   (Iran) [2007] EWCA Civ 460 at [9]:

      There is nothing wrong with the differential levels of proof or
      disproof of primary facts found by the tribunal. In �41, for example,
      they find it likely that the appellant would continue with Christian
      communion in Iran and that this would bring her to the attention of
      the authorities, but they do not accept that she would bear witness to
      her friends. In �46 they find that the fact that her parents are
      pensioners does not necessarily mean that they would be unable to
      protect her economically from persecution. The law does not demand, at
      least in this field, that each finding of fact, whatever its degree of
      certainty or uncertainty, be fitted into a single matrix of risk. The
      fact-finder's task is, to the extent made possible by the evidence, to
      find facts, and some facts are more certain than others. It would have
      been as unjust to the appellant to treat as mere possibilities things
      which, on the AIT's findings, were highly likely as it would have been
      to the respondent to treat possibilities of hardship as probabilities


19. At paragraph [10], the FtT directed itself correctly as to the standard
   of proof. In making its final decision, at paragraphs [56] and [57], the
   FtT stated that the appellants had not "discharged the burden of proof of
   having a well founded fear of persecution" and "there is not a real risk
   they will suffer a breach of their protected rights under Article 3".
   Read as a whole, it is apparent that the FtT has kept in mind, and
   applied, in reaching its ultimate conclusion as to the appellants' risk
   of return, the correct standard of proof.

20. I now turn to the question of whether the FtT failed to correctly apply
   MN.

21. The country guidance in MN states that if an Ahmadi is able to
   demonstrate that it is of particular importance to his religious identity
   to practice and manifest his faith openly in Pakistan, in defiance of the
   Pakistan Penal Code, by engaging in behaviour prescribed in paragraph
   2(i) of the headnote to the decision ("the paragraph 2(i) factors"), he
   or she is likely to be in need of protection. The paragraph 2(i) factors
   include:
         . Preaching and other forms of proselytising;
         . Holding open discourse about religion with non Ahmadis; and
         . Openly referring to one's place of worship as a mosque, to
           religious leaders as an imam, to the call to prayer as azan or
           to themselves as Muslims.

22. In my view, the FtT has made a material error of law by reaching its
   finding as to the risk the appellants would face on return to Pakistan
   without addressing whether the paragraph 2(i) factors were of particular
   importance to the religious identity of the appellants.

23. The FtT found that the first appellant would not be at risk because he
   has only preached discreetly, has not been involved in conversions and
   there is no reason he would be specifically targeted on return to
   Pakistan. The shortcoming of this analysis is that, firstly, the FtT has
   failed to address why the first appellant preached discreetly. The first
   appellant's evidence, as set out in his witness statement, was that he
   was discreet in his preaching because of anti-Ahmadi laws. This is
   material to the question of whether it is of particular importance to him
   to engage in preaching and it was an error for the FtT to not take
   account of, and make a finding in respect of, the first appellant's
   claimed reason for not preaching openly. Moreover, the FtT has not taken
   into consideration whether the other paragraph 2(i) factors are of
   particular importance to the first appellant. The decision focuses
   entirely on whether, and the extent to which, he was involved in
   conversions and preaching and does not engage with the other conduct
   enumerated in paragraph 2(i), which falls short of preaching and
   proselytising, but which can still give rise to a risk on return to
   Pakistan.

24. Similarly, in respect of the second appellant, the FtT has erred by
   failing to address whether the paragraph 2(i) factors apply in her
   particular circumstances. The FtT found she is not at risk of persecution
   because although she has faced taunts and harassment from time to time,
   she has never been specifically targeted. Although this is relevant to
   the question of whether she would be at risk on return to Pakistan, the
   absence from the decision of any consideration of whether engaging in the
   paragraph 2(i) factors is of particular importance to her religious
   identity amounts to an error of law.



25. Having regard to section 7.2(b) of the President's Practice Statement,
   it is my view that this case should be remitted to the First tier
   Tribunal and be heard afresh. I have considered whether the factual
   findings of Judge Oakley should be preserved but given that further
   factual evidence and findings will be necessary I consider it preferable
   that the matter is heard again de novo.

Decision

a. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of law
   such that it should be set aside in its entirety and the appeal heard
   afresh.


b. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh
   before a judge other than First tier Tribunal Judge Oakley.
