Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Joshi, Legal Representative

(1) Key features of ss.117A-117D of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
Act 2002 include the following:

   (a) judges are required statutorily to take  into  account  a  number  of
   enumerated considerations. Sections 117A-117D are not, therefore, an a la
   carte menu of considerations that it is at the discretion of the judge to
   apply or not apply.  Judges  are  duty-bound  to  "have  regard"  to  the
   specified considerations.


   (b) these provisions are only expressed as being binding on a  "court  or
   tribunal". It may be that the Secretary of State will consider it in  the
   interests of good administration and consistency  of  decision-making  on
   Article 8 claims at all levels to have  express  regard  to  ss.117A-117D
   considerations herself, but she is not directly bound to do so.


   (c) whilst expressed in mandatory terms, the considerations specified are
   not expressed as being exhaustive: note use of the phrase "in particular"
   in s.117A(2): " In considering the public interest question, the court or
   tribunal must (in particular) have regard- ".


   (d) section 117B enumerates considerations that are  applicable  "in  all
   cases", which must include  foreign  criminal  cases.  Thus  when  s.117C
   (which deals with foreign criminals) states that it sets out "additional"
   considerations that must mean considerations in addition to those set out
   in s.117B.


   (e) sections 117A-117D do not represent any  kind  of  radical  departure
   from or "override" of previous case law on Article 8 so far  as  concerns
   the need for a structured approach. In particular, they  do  not  disturb
   the need for judges to ask themselves  the  five  questions  set  out  in
   Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  Sections  117A-117D  are  essentially  a  further
   elaboration  of  Razgar's  question  5   which   is   essentially   about
   proportionality and justifiability.

(2)  It  is  not  an  error  of  law  to  fail  to  refer  to   ss.117A-117D
considerations if the judge has applied the test he or she was  supposed  to
apply according to its terms; what matters is substance, not form.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. In a determination dated  29  October  2014,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
(FtTJ) Juss allowed the appeal of the respondent  (hereafter  the  claimant)
against the decision of the appellant (hereafter Secretary of State for  the
Home Department (SSHD))  refusing  her  indefinite  leave  to  remain.   The
claimant is a citizen of Zimbabwe born in May 1948.

2. The claimant last came to the UK as a visitor in October 2002.  On 8  May
2003 she applied for leave to remain on  human  rights  grounds.   This  was
refused on 14 April 2004 with no right of appeal.   Further  representations
made on 6 April 2005 were refused on 18 July 2005.  Her appeal against  that
refusal was dismissed by an Immigration Judge in October 2005.

3. The claimant remained in the UK thereafter as an  overstayer.   In  2010,
2011 and 2012 she made further unsuccessful applications  for  leave.  After
considerable correspondence with the SSHD the application  she  made  on  11
January 2012 was refused in July 2014.  In giving reasons for  refusing  it,
the  SSHD  took  into  account,  inter  alia,  evidence  she  had  submitted
regarding her ties with three adult daughters (and their  children)  in  the
UK upon whom it was said she  was  financially  and  emotionally  dependent;
medical evidence showing that she had been  diagnosed  as  HIV  positive  in
2003 and also suffered from hyperthyroidism, dizzy spells and  memory  loss;
evidence that she was an active member of the Seventh Day Adventist  Church.
The SSHD concluded that it was not accepted that the claimant had  formed  a
family life with her children and grandchildren in the UK or that she  could
succeed under private life provisions of the Immigration Rules  because  she
had not lived continuously in the UK for twenty years or  more  and  on  her
own evidence still had family ties in Zimbabwe with two brothers  and  a  37
year old son. It was noted that she had remained clandestinely in the UK  in
full knowledge that she  did  not  have  permission  to  do  so.   The  SSHD
considered that she could continue being an active  member  of  the  Seventh
Day Adventist Church back in Zimbabwe and that she  could  maintain  contact
with her family members and friends via the means  of  modern  communication
after she returned to her home country.  As  regards  her  health  problems,
the SSHD considered that there was available treatment in  Zimbabwe  and  in
this regard referred to the Country of  Origin  Service  (COIS)  Report  for
Zimbabwe.

4.  The  refusal  letter  went  on  to   address   the   point   raised   by
representatives on her behalf in  September  2013  that  the  delay  in  any
decision being made had caused the claimant "undue  hardship".   The  SSHD's
response was to point to the  claimant's  breaches  of  immigration  law  by
failing to leave the UK voluntarily or  to  regularise  her  stay  until  31
March 2010: the majority of the delay in her case was said to be due to  her
own action in failing to submit any further application  to  regularise  her
stay until approximately  four  and  a  half  years  after  her  appeal  was
dismissed and she had become appeal rights exhausted.

First-tier Tribunal decision

5. At the hearing the FtTJ did not hear evidence but noted the  contents  of
a statement by Elizabeth Nyoni, the daughter of the claimant.  Having  heard
submissions from the parties, the judge noted that it was accepted  by  both
parties that the claimant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules.

6. The judge then proceeded to set out his reasons  for  deciding  to  allow
the claimant's appeal "under freestanding Article 8":

         "10. This is a case concerning a 68 year old woman  who  is  a  HIV
             sufferer, and undergoes dizziness, pain, and  stress,  and  is
             currently under the investigation of a consultant  neurologist
             (see page  19  of  the  Appellant's  bundle).   She  is  in  a
             vulnerable condition largely because of her health needs.  She
             cannot on the basis of N v the UK assert that she has a  right
             to medical treatment in this country as against  what  may  be
             available in Zimbabwe, these are facts that  must  necessarily
             be taken into  account  in  considering  how  the  balance  of
             considerations fall.


         11.  In that respect, she has been in the UK  since  October  2002,
             having lived here for fourteen years, and in  the  context  of
             enjoying family life with her children and her  grandchildren,
             to whom she is very close.  There was  ample  opportunity  for
             the Secretary of State to remove her.  This  could  have  been
             done in 2005.  It was not.  A good nine years went by,  during
             which time the Appellant has formed close family ties with her
             three children and grandchildren.  What  the  House  of  Lords
             said in EB (Kosovo) in the very clear judgment of Lord  Brown,
             was that delay  may  have  consequences  in  three  particular
             respects, one of which was that the longer the  time  goes  by
             when the Appellant is not removed, the greater her chances  of
             casting down roots, and the greater  the  realisation  on  her
             part, that she is not to be removed.


         12.  I must take these considerations into account when I apply the
             five step approach in  Razgar  adopted  by  Lord  Bingham  (at
             paragraph 17).  It is clear that the decision interferes  with
             the  Appellant's  Article  8  rights.   The  interference  has
             consequences of such gravity as to engage Article 8.  It is in
             accordance with the law.   It  may  even  be  necessary  in  a
             democratic society for the economic wellbeing of the  country.
             However, it is not proportionate to the legitimate public  end
             that is sought to be achieved.  I take into account that it is
             in the public interest, as is made clear  by  part  5  of  the
             latest Rules, that immigration control is maintained.


         13.  However, Lord Brown was clear in EB  (Kosovo)  that  the  very
             importance of immigration control, as a  consideration  to  be
             applied, diminishes with the passage of time, in relation to a
             person who should have been removed but is not removed by  the
             authorities.


         14.  I am satisfied that if the Appellant were to  be  removed  she
             would not be able to enjoy her family life  in  Zimbabwe  with
             her children and grandchildren in this country.  The effect of
             her removal would be the breakdown of her family  life.   That
             family life cannot be replicated if she were to be removed  to
             Zimbabwe.


         15.  On the totality of the evidence before me,  I  find  that  the
             Appellant has discharged the burden f proof  and  the  reasons
             given  by  the  Respondent  do  not   justify   the   refusal.
             Therefore, the Respondent's decision is not in accordance with
             the law and the applicable Rules."


SSHD's grounds of appeal

7. The SSHD's grounds of appeal were fivefold.  It was first submitted  that
the judge was wrong to treat delay as having "determinative weight"  because
the claimant knew that she stayed on in the UK in breach  of  her  visa  and
made no efforts to depart voluntarily.  Secondly, the point  was  made  that
any family or private life the claimant had was developed when she knew  she
had no legitimate expectation to continue it.  In the  third  place  it  was
argued that the FtTJ had failed to conduct  the  Article  8  proportionality
assessment in accordance with s.117  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
Asylum Act 2002 and the judge's incorrect reference to these  provisions  as
part of the 'Rules' indicated their misapplication.  In what were  expressed
as further limbs to the third ground, but were  effectively  two  additional
grounds, the SSHD contended  that  rather  than  approach  Article  8  open-
endedly the  judge  should  have  considered  the  claimant's  inability  to
succeed under the Immigration Rules as "a weighty proportionality factor  in
favour of  removal';  and  that  the  judge's  conclusion  that  removal  to
Zimbabwe would mean the "breakdown" of the claimant's family  life  was  not
made out, as her relationships with family members in the UK could still  be
maintained via modern communication means and visits.

Submissions

8. In submissions Mr Melvin accepted that between  2005-2011  the  SSHD  had
not taken steps  to  remove  the  claimant,  but,  maintained  that  it  was
incumbent on her to leave the UK  rather  than  remain  unlawfully  and  any
assessment of the delay factor had to take that into account as well as  the
fact that in her case there had been  a  delay  on  her  part  in  making  a
further application between 25 October 2005  and  31  March  2010.   It  was
clear from the second ground of appeal that  the  SSHD  had  considered  the
weight to be accorded to her relationships with family and  friends  in  the
UK as diminished by the fact that she developed or  maintained  these  at  a
time when she  knew  her  immigration  status  was  precarious.   Mr  Melvin
submitted  that  this  ground  coalesced  with  the  third   ground,   which
maintained that by virtue of the coming into force of  ss.117A-117D  of  the
2002 Act, judges had to show that they had taken  enumerated  considerations
into account. Plainly  the  judge  had  not  done  so  in  relation  to  the
precariousness provision set out in s.117B (5).

9.As regards family life, Mr Melvin submitted that not  only  did  the  SSHD
maintain her position as set out in the refusal  letter  that  the  claimant
had not established family life; her grounds also made clear that  she  took
issue with the judge's assessment that the claimant's departure from the  UK
would entail "breakdown" of her family life.  That was wrong because on  the
one hand she still had family in Zimbabwe and on  the  other  hand  her  own
relationship with family members here  could  be  maintained  by  electronic
means or by their visiting.  Mr Melvin also  questioned  whether  the  judge
had allowed the appeal  on  a  correct  basis,  since  he  referred  to  the
decision being "not in accordance with the law", when  it  plainly  was.  He
also referred to it   being not "in accordance with  the  applicable  Rules"
when he himself had recorded both parties as agreeing before  him  that  the
claimant could not win under the Rules.

10. Picking up on a point made in amplification  of  the  third  ground,  Mr
Melvin also criticised the judge for considering that  he  was  entitled  to
conduct "a freestanding" Article 8 assessment, when since 9  July  2012  the
Immigration Rules embodied Article 8 considerations and set out  the  SSHD's
view of the public interest.

11. Mr Joshi submitted that whatever the judge wrote at [15], it  was  clear
from [10] that he had allowed the appeal under Article 8.   In  relation  to
the delay point, the judge could not be faulted for following the  authority
of EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL  41.
  The  claimant  had  continued  reporting  to   immigration   officers   at
Loughborough Reporting Centre throughout the  time  she  was  appeal  rights
exhausted.  The Respondent did not take any  steps  to  remove  her.   Delay
could reduce the significance  to  be  given  to  immigration  control  when
conducting the Article 8 balancing exercise.   Lord  Brown  in  EB  (Kosovo)
clearly did not consider that  claimants  were  prevented  from  relying  on
delay  just  because  they  overstayed.   Further,  the  judge  who  granted
permission to appeal had expressly stated that there was  "no  legal  error"
in the FtTJ relying as he did on delay.  In relation to  the  SSHD's  second
ground, it was clearly the judge's view that the claimant had done  all  she
could to make her stay less precarious.  It was also  relevant  that  during
much of the period between 2005-2011 the  SSHD  had  herself  accepted  that
returns  to  Zimbabwe  should  not  take  place  because  the  country   was
dangerous.

12. As regards s.117, this had been raised by the claimant in  the  skeleton
argument produced on her behalf at the hearing before the FtTJ and it  could
not seriously be suggested that he had failed to take it into  account  just
because he incorrectly referred to its provisions as "Rules". "Part  5"  had
no other possible meaning than the new Part 5A of the 2002 Act contained  in
ss.117A-117D.

Sections 117A-117D

13. Section 19 of the 2014 Immigration Act introduced into the  Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 a new Part 5A containing new sections  117A-
117D. As explained by Aikens LJ in YM (Uganda) v Secretary of State for  the
Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1292 at [12]. '[t]his  new  Part  is  headed
"Article 8 of the ECHR: Public Interest Considerations".  The  new  sections
117A-117D set out statutory guidelines that must be applied when a court  or
tribunal has to decide whether an immigration  decision  to  remove  someone
from the UK would be in breach of his Article  8  rights.  The  new  section
117A is headed "Application of this Part"; the new section  117B  is  headed
"Article 8 public interest considerations in all cases" and the new 117C  is
headed "Article 8  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving  foreign
criminals"'.
14. In full ss. 117A-117D provide:
      117A Application of this Part
      (1)  This Part applies where  a  court  or  tribunal  is  required  to
      determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
      (a)  breaches a person's right to respect for private and family  life
      under Article 8, and
      (b)  as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights
      Act 1998.
      (2)  In  considering  the  public  interest  question,  the  court  or
      tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
      (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section 117B, and
      (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,  to  the
      considerations listed in section 117C.
      (3)  In subsection (2),  "the  public  interest  question"  means  the
      question of whether an interference with a person's right  to  respect
      for private and family life is justified under Article 8(2).
      117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases
      (1)The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the  public
      interest.
      (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
      of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  persons  who
      seek to enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  are  able  to  speak
      English, because persons who can speak English-
      (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
      (b) are better able to integrate into society.
      (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
      of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  persons  who
      seek to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
      independent, because such persons-
      (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
      (b) are better able to integrate into society.
      (4) Little weight should be given to-
      (a) a private life, or
      (b)  a  relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying  partner,  that   is
      established by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the  United
      Kingdom unlawfully.
      (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by  a
      person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.
      (6) In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
      public interest does not require the person's removal where-
      (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with
      a qualifying child, and
      (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United
      Kingdom.


      117C Article 8 additional considerations in  cases  involving  foreign
      criminals.
      (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
      (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,  the
      greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
      (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been sentenced
      to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the public interest
      requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.
      (4) Exception 1 applies where-
      (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of C's
      life,
      (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom, and
      (c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration  into
      the country to which C is proposed to be deported.
      (5)  Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship with a qualifying partner, or a  genuine  and  subsisting
      parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect  of  C's
      deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.
      (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who  has  been  sentenced  to  a
      period of imprisonment of at least four  years,  the  public  interest
      requires deportation unless there are very  compelling  circumstances,
      over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.
      (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken  into
      account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to  deport
      a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for the decision
      was the offence or offences for which the criminal has been convicted.
      117D Interpretation of this Part

      period of imprisonment of a certain length of time-
      (a)  do not include a person who has  received  a  suspended  sentence
      (unless a court subsequently orders that the sentence or any  part  of
      it (of whatever length) is to take effect);
      (b)  do not include a person who has been sentenced  to  a  period  of

      to consecutive sentences amounting in  aggregate  to  that  length  of
      time;
      (c)  include a person who is sentenced to  detention,  or  ordered  or
      directed to be  detained,  in  an  institution  other  than  a  prison
      (including, in particular, a hospital  or  an  institution  for  young
      offenders) for that length of time; and
      (d)  include a person who is sentenced to imprisonment  or  detention,
      or ordered or directed to be detained, for  an  indeterminate  period,
      provided that it may last for at least that length of time.
      (5) If any question arises for the purposes of this Part as to whether
      a person is a British citizen, it is for  the  person  asserting  that
      fact to prove it."
We shall say a little more about ss.117A-117D shortly.

Our Decision

15. We should first of all make clear that we do not construe the  grant  of
permission to appeal as limiting in any significant way the SSHD's  grounds.
It is true the only reason given for the  grant  was  by  reference  to  the
ss.117A-117D issue, but the grant  did  not  expressly  preclude  the  other
grounds and in relation to the first ground (which  challenged  the  judge's
treatment of delay as a "determinative" factor), all that was said was  that
there was "no legal error by the judge  in  taking  into  consideration  the
delay as this  all  forms  part  of  the  balancing  exercise".   That  left
unaddressed the nub of the first ground which alleged not that the FtTJ  had
erred  by  taking  delay  into  consideration,  but  in   treating   it   as
determinative.

16. Second, whilst we agree that in [15] the judge was  incorrect  to  state
that the decision under appeal was not in accordance with  the  law  or  the
Immigration Rules, we concur with Mr Joshi that this  error  was  immaterial
because he made clear in [10] his satisfaction that the claimant  had  shown
a violation of Article 8.

17. Third, we regard the SSHD's critique of the judge for  embarking  on  an
assessment under "freestanding Article 8" as missing the  mark  because  the
claimant had made her FLR(O) application prior to 9 July  2012,  i.e.  at  a
time when the Immigration Rules  did  not  seek  to  incorporate  Article  8
elements in any systemic way.

18. Fourth, we regard the SSHD's grounds as open to a number of  criticisms.
To the extent that the first ground sought  to  argue  that  the  judge  was
wrong to treat delay as "determinative", that is belied by the evident  fact
that he saw the case as requiring him to balance a number of  considerations
(the precise phrase he used being a "balance of  considerations")  and  that
he expressly took into account a number of  other  factors,  e.g.  that  the
claimant was 66 years old and HIV positive. Nowhere  did  he  say  or  imply
that he considered that the delay  factor  was  "determinative".  By  giving
itself the subtitle "legitimate expectation" the second ground risked  being
understood as an attack on a "straw  man",  since  the  claimant  had  never
claimed she had a legitimate expectation. In stating  in  the  third  ground
that the  judge's  reference  to  'Rules'  in  [12]  "indicate[d]  that  the
provisions of s.117 have been misapplied". The author laid himself  open  to
the charge that he had ignored the obvious fact that the  judge  could  only
have had ss.117A-117D in mind. The Rules contained no "Part 5" dealing  with
Article 8 considerations.

19. Nonetheless, the grounds read as a whole  did  raise  pertinent  issues:
they raised, inter alia, clear challenges to the way in which the judge  had
approached the issue of delay; his lack of regard for the precarious  nature
of the claimant's  immigration  status;  his  failure  to  take  account  of
ss.117A-117D considerations; and his assessment  that  removal  to  Zimbabwe
would mean "breakdown" of family life.

20. It is convenient  to  address  first  of  all  the  third  ground  which
concerned ss.117A-D. In order  to  explain  our  assessment  of  it,  it  is
necessary to say a little more about this new provision.  For  the  purposes
of this appeal several features of ss.117A-117D are noteworthy.

21. First, as highlighted in YM (Uganda), from 28 July 2014  the  effect  of
ss.117A-117D of the 2002 Act is that  judges  are  required  statutorily  to
take into account a number of enumerated considerations. That is clear  from
the language of s.117A(2): " In considering the public  interest  question,
the court or tribunal must (in particular) have regard-"  (emphasis  added).
Sections 117A-117D are not, therefore, an a la carte menu of  considerations
that it is at the discretion of the judge to apply  or  not  apply.   Judges
are duty-bound to "have regard" to the specified considerations.

22. Second, the provisions are only expressed as being binding on  a  "court
or tribunal". It may be that the SSHD will consider it in the  interests  of
good administration and consistency of decision-making on Article  8  claims
at all levels to have express regard to ss.117A-117D considerations  herself
(and we see more and more  decision letters where she does just  that),  but
she is not directly bound to do so.

23.  Third,  whilst  expressed  in  mandatory  terms,   the   considerations
specified are not expressed as being exhaustive: note use of the phrase  "in
particular" in s.117A(2): " In considering the  public  interest  question,
the court or tribunal must (in particular) have regard- ".

24. Fourth, it is clear  that  s.117B  enumerates  considerations  that  are
applicable "in all cases", which must include foreign criminal  cases.  Thus
when s.117C (which deals with foreign criminals) states  that  it  sets  out
"additional" considerations that must mean  considerations  in  addition  to
those set out in s.117B.

25.Fifth, we do not regard ss.  117A-117D  as  being  any  kind  of  radical
departure from or "override" of previous case law on Article  8  so  far  as
concerns the need for a structured approach.  In  particular,  it  does  not
disturb the need for judges to ask themselves the five questions set out  in
Razgar [2004] UKHL 27. Indeed it seems to us  that  in  effect  ss.117A-117D
are essentially a further  elaboration  of  Razgar's  question  5  which  is
essentially about  proportionality  and  justifiability[1]  (Lord  Bingham's
question 5 asks, assuming that in reply to previous questions  it  has  been
established that there had been an interference with the  right  to  respect
for private and family life, " [i]f so, is such  interference  proportionate
to the legitimate public end sought to be achieved?"). We derive  this  from
the definition given in s.117A(3):
    "In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means  the  question
    of whether an interference with a person's right to respect for private
    and family life is justified under Article 8(2)." (Emphasis added)
26. Sixth, bearing in mind that ss.117A-117D focus only on  certain  of  the
steps judges must take when dealing with Article  8  grounds  (and  they  do
not, for example, deal  with  whether  private  or  family  life  exists  or
whether there has been an interference with it), it cannot be said that  its
provisions are intended to modify existing learning as to when it is  or  is
not an error of law for a judge to have express regard to specific  elements
of a structured approach. To adapt the expression employed by the Master  of
the Rolls in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192  at  [50]  in  the  different
context of considering the impact of the new Immigration Rules on Article  8
case law, what matters is "substance", not "form".  In  AJ  (Angola)  [2014]
EWCA Civ 1636, Sales LJ at 49 identified as one of two  categories  of  case
in which an identified error of law by the  First  tier  Tribunal  or  Upper
Tribunal might be said to be immaterial, the situation  where  "despite  its
failure to refer to the relevant legal  instruments,  the  tribunal  has  in
fact applied the test which it was supposed  to  apply  according  to  those
instruments". Hence, it will not necessarily be an error of law for a  judge
to omit to refer expressly to ss.117A-117D  considerations,  albeit  it  may
well be if he or she fails to address them in substance.


27. Applying these observations to this appeal, it  is  clear  that  it  was
incumbent on the judge to apply ss.117A-117D  considerations:  although  the
claimant's application and the respondent's  decision  preceded  this  date,
the FtTJ determined this case on 29 October 2014 and was therefore bound  to
apply its provisions. At the same time, there  is  no  legal  error  in  his
decision simply because he failed to identify its provisions  precisely  and
confused its provisions with ones found  in  the  Immigration  Rules.  Legal
error would only  arise  if  he  failed  to  apply  relevant  ss.  117A-117D
provisions in substance. The Applicant was not  a  foreign  criminal;  hence
the only considerations potentially relevant to her were those contained  in
s.117A, 117B and 117D.

28. Mr Joshi sought to submit that on the basis of findings of fact made  by
the  judge  he  was  not  required  to  take   into   account   any   s.117B
considerations because the only one of any potential relevance was  confined
to private life cases whereas the  judge  had  found  the  claimant  enjoyed
family  life.  He  drew  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  precariousness
criterion set out at s. 117B(5) was confined in scope to private life:  "(5)
Little weight should be given to a private life established by a  person  at
a time when the person's immigration status is precarious."


29. A major difficulty with that  submission  is  that  the  judge  gave  no
reasons for his finding that the claimant enjoyed family  life  in  the  UK.
Given that the SSHD had rejected the claimant's claim to have a family  life
in the  UK  within  the  meaning  of  Article  8  and  considered  that  her
relationships had rather to  be  regarded  as  coming  within  her  "private
life", it was incumbent on the judge to explain  why  he  took  a  different
view.   Mr  Joshi  submitted  that  there  was  evidence  before  the  judge
substantiating her claim to enjoy family life within the meaning of  Article
8,  but that did not relieve the judge  of  the  duty  to  identify  it  and
explain why he considered it gave the lie to the contrary  position  of  the
SSHD.

30. Furthermore, as noted earlier, the  judge  clearly  saw  his  conclusion
that the claimant has  shown  a  violation  of  Article  8  as  involving  a
"balance of considerations" encompassing  not  just  the  claimant's  family
life but also her age, poor health and vulnerability and her length of  stay
in the United Kingdom.  A number of these factors indisputably  lay  in  the
domain of private life (her poor health being an aspect  of  her  moral  and
physical integrity: see e.g. Bensaid v UK (2001) 33  EHRR  205,  Razgar  per
Lord Bingham at [5]-[10]; JA (Ivory Coast) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the
Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 1353 and GS (India) &  Ors  v  Secretary  of
State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 40 [109]).

31. It must also be borne in mind that the claimant had remained in  the  UK
unlawfully  since  late  2005.  Accordingly  both  s.  117B(4)(b)  and   (5)
considerations had potential application.

32. Another difficulty is  that  being  a  non-exhaustive  specification  of
certain Article 8 considerations, ss.117A-117D do not disinvest a  judge  of
the  need  to  apply  established  principles  of  case  law  dealing   with
considerations not covered. As Mr Melvin correctly  observed,  both  UK  and
Strasbourg case law on Article 8 identifies the issue of whether  ties  with
other persons have been formed at a time when an  applicant  is  aware  that
his or her immigration status is precarious as a relevant factor in  respect
of both family life and private life. As stated in the recent Grand  Chamber
judgment in Jeunesse v Netherlands Application no. 12738/10), 2 Oct 2014:

       "108.  Another important consideration is whether family  life  was
      created at a time when  the  persons  involved  were  aware  that  the
      immigration status of one of them was such  that  the  persistence  of
      that family life within the  host  State  would  from  the  outset  be
      precarious. It is the Court's well-established  case-law  that,  where
      this is the case, it is likely only to be in exceptional circumstances
      that the removal of the non-national family member will  constitute  a
      violation of Article 8 (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali  v.  the
      United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, p. 94, � 68;
      Mitchell v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 40447/98, 24 November 1998;
      Ajayi and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27663/95, 22  June
      1999; M. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.  25087/06,  24  June  2008;
      Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands,  cited  above,  �
      39; Arvelo Aponte v. the Netherlands, cited above, �� 57-58; and  Butt
      v. Norway, cited above, � 78)."

Whether or not by reference to s.117B or to established case law  the  First
tier Tribunal judge was required to  have  regard  to  this  criterion.  Any
decision on the "public interest question" as  defined  by  s.117A(3)  would
have been incomplete without it.

33. Mr Joshi contended that it  did  not  matter  that  the  judge  had  not
engaged specifically with s.117 because ss.117A-117D in no  way  reverse  or
modify the principles set out in EB (Kosovo).  He reminded us of  what  Lord
Bingham of Cornhill had said at [13]-[16] of that decision:
         "Delay
      1. In Strbac v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005]  EWCA
         Civ 848, [2005] Imm AR 504, para 25, counsel for the applicant  was
         understood to contend, in  effect,  that  if  the  decision  on  an
         application for leave to enter or remain was made after the  expiry
         of an unreasonable period of time, and  if  the  application  would
         probably have met with success, or a greater chance of success,  if
         it had been decided within a reasonable time, and if the  applicant
         had in the meantime established a family life in this  country,  he
         should be treated when the decision is ultimately made  as  if  the
         decision had been made at that earlier time. For reasons  given  by
         Laws LJ, the Court of Appeal rejected this submission, for which it
         held Shala v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA
         Civ 233, [2003] INLR 349 to be no authority. While I consider  that
         Shala was correctly decided on its facts, I am satisfied  that  the
         Court of Appeal was right to reject this submission. As Mr Sales QC
         for the respondent pointed out, there is no specified period within
         which, or at which, an  immigration  decision  must  be  made;  the
         facts, and with them government policy, may change over  a  period,
         as they did here; and the duty of the  decision-maker  is  to  have
         regard to the facts, and any policy in force, when the decision  is
         made.  Mr  Drabble  QC,  for  the  appellant,  did  not  make  this
         submission, and he was right not to do so.
      1. It does not, however, follow  that  delay  in  the  decision-making
         process  is  necessarily  irrelevant  to  the  decision.  It   may,
         depending on the facts, be relevant  in  any  one  of  three  ways.
         First, the applicant may during the period  of  any  delay  develop
         closer personal and social ties and establish deeper roots  in  the
         community than he could have shown earlier. The longer  the  period
         of the delay, the likelier this is to be true. To the  extent  that
         it is true, the applicant's claim under article 8 will  necessarily
         be strengthened. It is unnecessary to elaborate  this  point  since
         the respondent accepts it.
      1. Delay may be relevant in a second, less obvious, way. An  immigrant
         without leave to enter or remain is in a very precarious situation,
         liable to be removed at any time. Any relationship into which  such
         an applicant enters is likely to be,  initially,  tentative,  being
         entered into under the shadow of severance by administrative order.
         This is the more true where the other party to the relationship  is
         aware of the applicant's precarious position. This has been treated
         as relevant to the quality of the relationship. Thus in R (Ajoh)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  655,
         para 11, it was noted that "It was reasonable to expect  that  both
         [the applicant] and her husband would be aware  of  her  precarious
         immigration status". This reflects the Strasbourg  court's  listing
         of factors relevant to the proportionality of removing an immigrant
         convicted of crime: "whether the spouse knew about the  offence  at
         the time when he or she entered into  a  family  relationship"  see
         Boultif v Switzerland (2001) 33 EHRR 50, para 48; Mokrani v  France
         (2003) 40 EHRR 123, para 30. A relationship  so  entered  into  may
         well be imbued with a sense of impermanence.  But  if  months  pass
         without a decision to remove being made, and months  become  years,
         and year succeeds year, it is to be expected  that  this  sense  of
         impermanence will fade and the expectation will grow  that  if  the
         authorities had intended to remove the applicant  they  would  have
         taken steps to do so. This result depends on no legal doctrine  but
         on an understanding of how, in some cases, minds may  work  and  it
         may affect the proportionality of removal.
      1. Delay may be relevant, thirdly, in reducing the weight otherwise to
         be accorded to  the  requirements  of  firm  and  fair  immigration
         control, if the delay is shown to be the result of a  dysfunctional
         system  which  yields  unpredictable,   inconsistent   and   unfair
         outcomes. In the present case the appellant's cousin,  who  entered
         the country and applied for asylum  at  the  same  time  and  whose
         position is not  said  to  be  materially  different,  was  granted
         exceptional leave to remain, during the two-year  period  which  it
         took the respondent to correct its erroneous decision to refuse the
         appellant's application on grounds of non-compliance. In  the  case
         of JL (Sierra Leone), heard by the Court of Appeal at the same time
         as the present case, there was a somewhat similar pattern of facts.
         JL escaped from Sierra Leone with her half  brother  in  1999,  and
         claimed asylum. In 2000 her claim was refused on  grounds  of  non-
         compliance. As in the appellant's case this decision was erroneous,
         as the respondent recognised eighteen  months  later.  In  February
         2006 the half brother was granted humanitarian protection. She  was
         not. A system so operating  cannot  be  said  to  be  "predictable,
         consistent and fair as between one applicant  and  another"  or  as
         yielding "consistency of treatment between one  aspiring  immigrant
         and another". To the extent that this is shown to  be  so,  it  may
         have a bearing on the proportionality of removal, or  of  requiring
         an applicant to apply from out of country. As Carnwath LJ  observed
         in Akaeke v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005]  EWCA
         Civ 947, [2005] INLR 575, para 25:
         "Once it is accepted that unreasonable delay on  the  part  of  the
         Secretary of State is capable of being a relevant factor, then  the
         weight to be given to it in the particular case was  a  matter  for
         the tribunal"."

34.  We need not decide whether he is right about the ratio of  EB  (Kosovo)
being unaffected  by  ss.  117A-117D   because  even  if  delay  remains  as
relevant to an Article  8  proportionality  assessment  in  the  three  ways
identified by Lord Bingham, it can only do  so  if  the  judge's  assessment
also  takes into account s.117B considerations. That is so for two  reasons,
one being the basic verity that if EB (Kosovo) stands  for  any  proposition
of law inconsistent with statute, the latter must prevail; the  other  being
that Lord Bingham clearly saw the proportionality  assessment  as  one  that
had to be made in light  of  any  changes  in  government  policy:  "....the
facts, and with them government policy, may change over a  period,  as  they
did here; and the duty of the  decision-maker  is  to  have  regard  to  the
facts, and any policy in force, when the decision is made" [13]. It  follows
that if the government has enacted statutory provisions governing Article  8
proportionality assessment, that change must be taken into  account.  Renvoi
to EB (Kosovo) is not enough.

35. We would add that quite separately from the  judge's  failure  to  apply
s.117B, we consider he also erred in his approach to the  claimant's  family
life.  Even if we were to overlook his  failure  to  explain  the  basis  on
which  he   considered  he  was  entitled  to  find  that   the   claimant's
relationship with her adult daughters and grandchildren amounted  to  family
life within the meaning of Article 8 (and we are not  prepared  to  overlook
that),  assessment  of  the  proportionality   of   interference   in   such
relationships  must  also  take  into  account  a   person's   family   life
relationships as a whole and must give consideration to the significance  or
otherwise of relationships with  close  family  members  in  the  claimant's
country of return as well as in the UK.  Despite the  unchallenged  evidence
that the claimant had a son in Zimbabwe and two brothers, the judge made  no
reference whatsoever to  them.  This  failure  resulted,  in  turn,  in  his
improbably considering that return to Zimbabwe would  not  just  lead  to  a
breakdown  of  her  relationship  with  family  members  in  the  UK  but  a
"breakdown of her family life" per se.  He was in  effect  saying  that  her
removal would amount to the destruction or flagrant denial of her  right  to
respect for family life.  That  was  contrary  to  the  undisputed  evidence
about continuing family ties in Zimbabwe. If against  this  it  were  to  be
argued that the judge must have considered the claimant's ties  with  family
in Zimbabwe were not family life ties within the meaning of Article 8  (that
was the thrust of the claimant's sister's statement), then that  would  only
magnify the problem that he has failed to make reasoned findings  on  either
set of family ties.

36. We find that the above errors were errors of law vitiating  the  judge's
decision and necessitating that we set it aside.

37. We heard submissions as to how  we  should  proceed  to  deal  with  the
claimant's case if we decided (as we  have)  to  set  it  aside,  Mr  Melvin
saying he was content to leave it to us, Mr Joshi saying we should  order  a
further hearing.  We are persuaded that justice  would  best  be  served  by
adjourning the case for a further hearing in order to re-make the  decision.
 We had initially  thought  we  had  sufficient  before  us  to  re-make  it
ourselves without  further  ado.   On  reflection,  we  consider  that  more
evidence is needed.  Neither the claimant nor her  witnesses  gave  evidence
before the FtTJ notwithstanding that there were  clear  differences  between
her and the respondent over the  nature  and  quality  of  her  family  life
relationships in the UK.  In our judgment the evidence presented to  support
the claimant's claim to be financially  and  emotionally  dependent  on  her
children in the UK needs testing.   In  addition,  if  the  SSHD  wishes  to
maintain that it was reasonable to expect the claimant to leave the UK  from
May 2005 onwards, she needs to explain how that would have  been  consistent
with Home Office policy not to enforce returns  to  Zimbabwe  for  at  least
some of the period between 2005-2012.  It may be in  this  regard  that  one
relevant consideration in this case is that  the  claimant  did  say  in  an
earlier statement of 14 December 2011 that she had "permission  to  live  in
Zambia" (see paragraph 3l0 of SSHD's refusal letter) and so she  could  have
gone to that country as an alternative; but that just  reinforces  the  need
for an oral hearing at which the claimant has the opportunity to  give  oral
evidence and be cross-examined.  This  hearing  should  take  place  in  the
Upper Tribunal.

38. For the above reasons the FtTJ materially erred in law and his  decision
is set aside.

39. It is directed that there be a further hearing at which the claimant  is
afforded the opportunity of giving oral evidence and the  SSHD  is  afforded
the opportunity of cross-examining  her.   If  other  witnesses  are  to  be
called, the  claimant's  representatives  must  submit  a  specific  request
stating their names and the likely time their further  evidence  is  thought
likely to take. The claimant's representatives are also to  file  up-to-date
witness statements from  any  such  person  or  persons.   The  claimant  is
directed to notify the Upper Tribunal regarding  witnesses  within  14  days
from service of this decision.

40. No anonymity direction is made.

-----------------------
[1] As to the meaning of "justified" Aikens LJ in MM & Ors, R (On the
