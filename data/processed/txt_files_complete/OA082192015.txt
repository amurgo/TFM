Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Mill (the judge), promulgated on 22  December  2016,  in
    which he dismissed her appeal against  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision of 15 April 2015.  That refusal arose out  of  an  application
    for entry clearance made on 9 March 2015.  The application was made  in
    order for the Appellant to join his parents in the United Kingdom.  His
    father is an ex-Gurkha soldier, and the Appellant sought leave in  line
    with  the  Respondent's  policy,  issued  in  January  2015,  on  adult
    dependant relatives of ex-Gurkha servicemen.



The hearing before the judge

 2. The Respondent was unrepresented at the hearing before the  judge.   An
    allegation of deception had been raised by the Entry Clearance  Officer
    in the refusal notice relating to an  apparently  false  document.   At
    paragraphs 16 to 19 of his decision the judge found in  favour  of  the
    Appellant on this issue.  This matter is no longer live.

 3. At paragraph 20 the judge goes on to set out findings of primary  fact.
    These include the following:

      a) The Appellant was single and had never been married;

      b) his father was in fact an ex-Gurkha soldier, having  served  for  a
         number of years and attaining the rank of corporal;

      c) the Appellant's parents had been granted leave to enter the  United
         Kingdom in 2010 under the Respondent's policy.  They had arrived in
         the United Kingdom on 1 August 2010 when the appellant was aged 25;



      d) the Appellant has four siblings, one of  whom  is  in  the  British
         Army, while the others still reside in Nepal;

      e) since leaving Nepal the Appellant's parents had maintained frequent
         indirect communications with him and had visited in 2013 and 2015;

      f) the appellant was financially supported by his  parents,  and  this
         included provision for his rent and other living expenses.

 4. At paragraph 23 the judge states that there  was  no  relevant  medical
    evidence and he was not satisfied that the appellant had any special or
    "exceptional" needs which required specific  assistance  or  dependence
    upon his parents.  At paragraph 25 it is concluded that  there  was  no
    family life between the appellant and his parents "over and above  that
    which ordinarily exists between an adult child and  his  parents".   In
    paragraph 28 it is stated that even if there had been family  life  the
    Respondent's decision would be proportionate.



The ground of appeal and grant of permission

 5. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge has got it wrong in respect
    of whether there was  family  life  or  not,  and  in  respect  of  the
    assessment of the historic injustice issue.  Permission to  appeal  was
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge McGinty on 25 July 2017.



The hearing before me

 6. Mr Jaisri relied upon his grounds of appeal.   Mr  Armstrong  submitted
    that there were no errors  and  that  the  judge  had  made  sufficient
    findings of fact.

Decision on error of law

 7. I find that there are material errors of law in the judge's decision.

 8. The first of these relate to the approach  taken  to  the  question  of
    family life.  The test as to  whether  there  is  family  life  between
    parents and adult children does indeed remain that set out in  Kugathas
    [2003] EWCA Civ 31.  However, the application of this test must be seen
    in light of subsequent case law including, for example  Ghising  [2012]
    UKUT 00160 (IAC) and, more recently, Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320.  Although
    the  judgment  in  Rai  postdates  the  judge's  decision,  it  clearly
    represents the correct approach at whatever time an assessment is being
    made.  Rai makes a number of important points.  First, there is no test
    of exceptionality when assessing whether family life exists  (paragraph
    36).  Looking at paragraph 23 of the judge's decision,  it  appears  as
    though the judge may well  have  in  fact  been  applying  an  elevated
    threshold,  requiring  an  exceptional  feature  of  some  sort,   when
    undertaking his assessment.  This indicates an error in approach.

 9. Rai also deals with the issue of ex-Gurkha servicemen (and often  their
    spouses as well) leaving Nepal to  come  to  the  United  Kingdom  once
    settlement  was  granted  and  leaving  behind  adult  children.    The
    Respondent often regards this as being a matter of "free choice" as  it
    were, and holds this against the existence of  family  life.   In  this
    case, the judge appears to have done the same thing.  At  paragraph  25
    he states, "the starting point for this conclusion  [that  family  life
    did not exist] is the appellant's parents'  decision  to  move  to  the
    United Kingdom without the appellant in 2010".  However as  Rai  points
    out  at  paragraphs  38-42,  the  decision  to  leave  was  simply  the
    exercising of a right of settlement which should have been  granted  to
    ex-Gurkhas many years ago: the Appellant's  parents  were  in  a  sense
    righting a historic wrong.  Although I appreciate the fact  that  I  am
    assessing the judge's decision with the hindsight of  Rai,  it  remains
    the case that significant weight being placed upon  parents'  departure
    under the government's policy may well be indicative  of  an  error  in
    approach to the question of whether family  life  continued  after  the
    parents' departure.

10. The judge has made a number of findings of fact at paragraph 20.  These
    must have formed the basis for his assessment of  whether  family  life
    existed.  There is nothing to suggest that he had rejected the evidence
    that the Appellant lived with his parents from birth until the point of
    their departure in 2010.  In  light  of  this  and  the  findings  just
    referred to, it is somewhat difficult to see why the judge came to  the
    conclusion that family life was not present.  The appropriate  test  is
    in essence whether the support provided by the parents to the Appellant
    over the course of time was "committed" and/or "effective".   In  light
    of the findings actually made, it would appear  though  this  threshold
    was met: the Appellant was not earning money of his  own,  the  parents
    were paying for all essential needs including  his  accommodation,  and
    this financial support had been ongoing since the parents' departure in
    2010.  In addition to all of this, there was a  positive  finding  that
    frequent indirect communications had been maintained, together with two
    visits by the parents to Nepal in 2013 and 2015.

11. Taking all of the above matters into account, there has been  an  error
    in approach  relating  to  the  question  of  family  life  by  way  of
    misdirection and a lack of adequate reasons in light of  the  facts  as
    found.

12. As to the alternative conclusion on proportionality  at  paragraph  28,
    there is a clear material error here.  No reference is made to the very
    significant factor of the historic injustice, a factor  that  has  been
    reaffirmed in a number of cases ranging from Ghising, to Gurung  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 8, and onto Rai most recently.   The  error  relating  to  the
    family life issue is therefore material.

13. I set aside the judge's decision.




Re-making the decision

14. Both representatives were agreed that I could  and  should  remake  the
    decision on the basis of the evidence before me.

15. Mr Armstrong confirmed that there was no  challenge  to  the  sponsor's
    credibility, and that the judge's findings at  paragraph  20  could  be
    used as a basis for my own decision.   Mr  Jaisri  confirmed  that  the
    Appellant's situation now was the same as at the time before the  judge
    and there was no new evidence to be submitted.  Mr  Armstrong  did  not
    raise any challenge to either the evidence or the relevant case law.

16. I have had regard to the materials contained  within  the  Respondent's
    bundle together with that contained in the Appellant's bundle.

17. I make the following findings of fact based  in  large  part  upon  the
    judge's findings at paragraph 20 and the unchallenged  evidence  before
    me.  The appellant lived with his parents in  Nepal  from  birth  until
    they  left  that  country  in  August  2010.   Thereafter,  they   have
    maintained regular indirect communications and had visited him  on  two
    occasions  for  not  insignificant  periods.   They  have  continuously
    provided essential financial support to the Appellant.  This support is
    both committed and effective. The Appellant has no income  of  his  own
    and relies wholly upon funds provided by his parents.  His parents came
    to this country in 2010 because they had been granted  settlement.   It
    is clear from the evidence that they would  have  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom many years earlier, together with their children, if  they  had
    been able to do so.  I also find that the fact of the  entry  clearance
    application being made only a couple of months after the publication of
    the Respondent's policy on adult dependent relatives in January 2015 is
    indicative of the close bonds between the family members. The Appellant
    is single, and has no particular medical conditions.

18. In light of the above I find that there was  family  life  between  the
    Appellant and his parents before they left Nepal in 2010, and that this
    life has subsisted ever since.  In so finding I apply the Kugathas test
    seen in the context of relevant case law I have referred to earlier, in
    particular paragraphs 36 to 42 of Rai.

19. The Respondent's refusal of entry clearance constituted an interference
    (or  a  lack  of  respect  for)  the  Appellant's  family  life.    The
    Respondent's decision was in accordance with the law  and  pursued  the
    legitimate aim of maintaining effective immigration control.

20. I turn to the issue  of  proportionality.   I  take  into  account  the
    provisions of the Respondent's policy contained in Annex K, Chapter 15,
    Section  2A,  paragraph  13.2  of  the  relevant  IDI.   The  Appellant
    satisfies all of the requirements save for one, namely that  there  had
    been more than a two-year gap between his parents leaving in  2010  and
    then returning to see him in 2013.  I take this  factor  into  account.
    There  are  no  issues  of  criminality  or  misconduct  in  this  case
    whatsoever.  The public interest is clearly a very important factor and
    one to which I attach significant weight.  The Appellant is not and  on
    arrival probably would not be financially independent in his own right,
    and nor do I have evidence that his level of English  of  a  reasonable
    standard.  These two factors would count against him as well.

21. Having said that, and in light of paragraphs 55 to 57 of Rai, I do  not
    conclude that the mandatory factors set out in section 117B of the 2002
    Act have such a cumulative effect as  to  outweigh  the  very  powerful
    factor that is the historic injustice.  The importance of  this  factor
    has been recognised in numerous decisions of  the  Upper  Tribunal  and
    higher courts over the years.  It tips the scales  in  the  Appellant's
    favour in this case.

22. I conclude, taking  everything  into  account,  that  the  Respondent's
    decision  was,  and  is,  a  disproportionate  interference  with   the
    Appellant's protected Article 8 rights.

23. The Appellant therefore succeeds in his appeal on Article 8 grounds.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law.

I therefore set it aside.

I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140.00. The Appellant has essentially succeeded on  the  basis  on
which the application  was  made.  The  evidence  before  me  has  not  been
challenged by the Respondent.
