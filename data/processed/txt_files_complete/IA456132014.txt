Representation:
Appellant   Miss Hashmi (Legal (Representative)
Respondent  Mr Harrison (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan.  The background to  this  case
    is that the appellant entered the United Kingdom legally as  a  student
    on June 20, 2004 initially with leave until July 22, 2005.  That  leave
    was extended on four subsequent occasions until May 31, 2009  and  then
    he was granted leave to remain as a Tier  4  student  until  August  4,
    2010. He then applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post study work)
    migrant and this enabled him to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  until
    August 13, 2012.

 2. He made two failed attempts  to  remain  as  a  Tier  one  entrepreneur
    migrant on August 13, 2012 and September  29,  2012.  These  were  both
    rejected on September 18, 2012 and March 25, 2013 respectively.

 3. The first application was rejected due to non-payment of a fee and  the
    second application was rejected with  no  right  of  appeal.  A  failed
    judicial review challenge was made and on December 6, 2013 he made  his
    third and final application to remain as a Tier 1 entrepreneur but this
    was also refused on May 6, 2014 with no right of appeal.

 4. On June 23, 2014 he made an application for indefinite leave to  remain
    on the basis of ten-years lawful residence but this was refused by  the
    respondent on October 16, 2014. He appealed that decision  on  November
    12, 2014 under section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002.

 5. The matter was heard by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Levin  on
    January 26, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on February 6,  2015  he
    refused his appeal under the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

 6. The appellant applied for permission to appeal  on  February  19,  2015
    submitting the Tribunal had erred. Permission to appeal was granted  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ievins on April 9, 2015  only  on  the
    basis that it  was  not  clear  if  the  Tribunal  had  considered  the
    application under article 8 ECHR.

 7. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response  on  May  6,  2015  maintaining
    there was no error in law.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 8. Miss Hashmi relied on the grounds of appeal  and  initially  sought  to
    argue that the Tribunal had erred in its approach to paragraph 276B  HC
    395.  She  thereafter  addressed  me  on  the  possible  error  of  law
    identified in  the  permission  to  appeal.   She  submitted  that  the
    Tribunal had failed to have regard to the medication he was  taking  or
    attach sufficient weighted to the fact that he  had  lived  here  since
    2004 and had not been reliant on the state and spoke excellent English.
    She submitted  that  the  appellant's  removal  was  not  proportionate
    because he would face difficulties on return because he had no family.

 9. Mr Harrison relied on the rule  24  response  and  submitted  that  all
    findings made by the Tribunal were open  to  it.  The  decision  was  a
    carefully prepared and a written decision. The  appellant's  leave  had
    expired in September 2012 when his application to remain  was  refused.
    The Tribunal had regard to why he came here in the first place and  was
    fully aware that he spoke excellent English and had obtained  excellent
    academic  qualifications.  These  were  factors   that   the   Tribunal
    considered  in  an  article  8  assessment.  Whilst  the  Tribunal  has
    suggested that the Immigration Rules were a complete code it went on to
    consider all the relevant law and facts before  finding  removal  would
    not be disproportionate. The issue relating to the appellant's  medical
    condition was not something that was raised at the original hearing and
    in any event there was no medical evidence to suggest that his ailments
    could not be treated in Pakistan.

    DISCUSSION

10. I raised with Miss Hashmi why she was arguing that  the  appellant  had
    been here lawfully when both the first Tier Tribunal and the Judge  who
    granted permission had both found this not to be the case. I  indicated
    to her that that issue was closed and that the Tribunal  had  found  he
    had not satisfied the requirements of paragraph 276B  HC  395  and  the
    only issue for me to consider was whether the Tribunal had  erred  when
    making reference to paragraph 276B and 276ADE HC 395 being  a  complete
    code.

11. Whilst the Tribunal had referred to the Rules as being a complete  code
    in paragraph [30] it was clear that the Tribunal  from  paragraph  [25]
    until paragraph [33] had considered this case under article 8 ECHR.

12. The Tribunal had had regard to section 117B of the  2002  Act  and  had
    taken into account positive points  made  on  the  appellant's  behalf.
    However, the Tribunal was entitled to find the appellant's  immigration
    history together with the fact that his private life was  created  when
    his immigration status was either  unlawful  or  precarious  outweighed
    anything put forward on his behalf.

13. There was no medical evidence to suggest  that  he  could  not  receive
    treatment for his  various  ailments  in  Pakistan.  The  Tribunal  had
    rejected his claim that he had no family and noted that up until he was
    prevented from leaving the United Kingdom he had  visited  Pakistan  on
    three occasions most recently in December 2011.

14. The Tribunal's findings were clearly open to  it.  It  was  unfortunate
    that there was a reference to a complete code but to  be  fair  to  the
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal that argument was commonly advanced at
    the time he heard the evidence. In any event and importantly,  he  went
    on to consider the appellant's claim under article 8 and  dismissed  it
    with valid reasons.

15. There is no merit to this appeal and I dismissed it.

    DECISION

16. There was no material error.  I uphold the original decision.
