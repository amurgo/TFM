                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Jerromes  promulgated  30.10.15,  dismissing  on  human
    rights grounds the appellant's appeal against the decision of the Entry
    Clearance Officer, dated 6.11.14, to  refuse  entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as a visitor.  The Judge heard the appeal on 20.10.15.

 2. Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer, sitting as  a  judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, granted permission to appeal on 9.5.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 17.6.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out briefly below, I found no error of law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Jerromes to be set aside.

 5. The relevant background  can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  An
    application by the appellant to visit the UK was refused  in  2007,  on
    the basis that false documents had been submitted with the application.
    In October 2014 the appellant applied again, stating the purpose of her
    visit was to attend the first wedding anniversary celebrations  of  her
    son, settled in the UK. By the date of decision  this  anniversary  had
    already passed.

 6. This application was also refused, relying on  both  paragraph  320(7B)
    and the requirements of paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules. There is
    a convoluted history to the appeal, which Judge Jerromes set out in the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal. In essence,  reliance  on  320(7B)
    was  withdrawn,  but  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  considered   that
    insufficient evidence had been given of her financial circumstances  in
    Sri Lanka and was not satisfied that she intended to leave  the  UK  on
    conclusion of her visit. Later, the respondent sought to  withdraw  the
    decision  altogether,  but  that  was  opposed   by   the   appellant's
    representatives. Rather oddly, the grounds  of  appeal  drafted  by  Ms
    Heller of counsel complain that the judge failed to  give  reasons  for
    permitting the appeal to proceed, which is in direct opposition to  the
    specific request made  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that  it  should
    proceed. In the circumstances, there is no merit in this ground at all.



 7. Judge Jerromes observed that as the only right of appeal was  on  human
    rights grounds, it was not within the remit of the Tribunal to overturn
    the refusal decision on immigration  grounds.  However,  as  stated  at
    �91.2, the judge was entitled to consider the merits of the decision on
    the Rules, only if article 8 is engaged  and  only  insofar  as  it  is
    relevant to any article 8 ECHR proportionality assessment, as  held  by
    the Upper Tribunal in Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT  0261
    (IAC).

 8. The judge also cited Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT
    112 (IAC), to  the  effect  that  it  will  only  be  in  very  unusual
    circumstances that a person other than a close relative will be able to
    show that refusal of a visit visa comes within article 8  and  even  in
    such close relationships, "it will not necessarily be extended to cases
    where, for example, the proposed visit is based on a whim or  will  not
    add significantly to the time that the people involved spend together."

 9. Judge  Jerromes  accepted  that  there  was  family  life  between  the
    appellant in Sri Lanka and family members settled in the  UK  and  that
    the refusal of entry clearance interfered with that  family  life,  but
    concluded, bearing in mind that the  wedding  anniversary  had  already
    passed by the date of decision, that the desires of  the  appellant  to
    visit her son and family  in  the  UK  did  not  amount  to  individual
    interests of a particularly pressing nature,  relying  on  Kaur  (visit
    appeals;  Article  8)  [2015]   UKUT   00487   (IAC),   or   compelling
    circumstances justifying allowing  the  appeal  outside  the  Rules  on
    article 8 grounds, pursuant to SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Plimmer noted that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge made a number of positive factual  findings,  "such
    that it appears to have been accepted  that  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules were met. Given this, the close family  relationships
    involved and the low threshold posed by the second Razgar question, the
    Judge arguably erred in law in finding that  the  consequences  of  the
    refusal of entry clearance would not be sufficiently  grave  to  engage
    Article 8."

11. Ms Wass submitted that having accepted the sponsor's  credibility,  the
    judge should have accepted that the original purpose of the  visit  was
    culturally significant, as claimed. However, the judge was  faced  with
    the situation that the appeal had to  be  based  on  the  circumstances
    prevailing at the date of the  refusal  decision,  by  which  date  the
    wedding anniversary had long passed. The judge accepted the appellant's
    desire to visit her family members, children and grandchildren  in  the
    UK, even though that  was  not  specifically  raised  in  the  original
    application. The real issue in the case is whether  the  judge  was  in
    material error of law in considering that the  interference  with  that
    desire to pursue family life was not sufficiently grave to  engage  the
    second  question  of  Razgar.  Finding  that  it  did  not,  the  judge
    considered it unnecessary to go on to consider proportionality.

12. Mr Bramble submitted that there was no  material  error  and  suggested
    that the grounds amounted to no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
    judge's findings and conclusions.

13. It is clear that the judge took careful account of the case law,  cited
    above, and recognised the tension between the desires of the  appellant
    to visit family members and the threshold necessary to  engage  article
    8. Ms Wass pointed that the Court of Appeal has held  in  AG  (Eritrea)
    [2007] EWCA Civ 801, that the threshold for such  interference  causing
    "consequences of such gravity," is not specially high.

14. It may be that another judge would have come to a different conclusion.
    However, on the  facts  of  this  case,  I  cannot  find  this  judge's
    assessment  and  ultimate  conclusion  on  the  appeal  was   perverse,
    irrational, or one that no reasonable judge could arrive at. It may  be
    that the balance between the stated intentions of the appellant and the
    Razgar assessment would more helpfully have been addressed, at least in
    the alternative, in the proportionality assessment, rather  than  under
    the second question engagement with article 8. However, I am  satisfied
    that the outcome of the appeal would have been the  same,  so  that  if
    there was an error of law it was not material. On the factual  findings
    of the judge and the withdrawal of reliance on paragraph  320(7B),  the
    appellant may have more success in making a fresh application,  as  the
    judge hoped at �30 of the decision. The  prospect  of  such  a  further
    application would  also  have  been  relevant  to  any  proportionality
    assessment under article 8.



Conclusions:

15. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
