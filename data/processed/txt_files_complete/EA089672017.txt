For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellant, a national of Ghana born  on  24  June  1972,  appeals,  with
permission, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  dismissing  her
appeal against the respondent's decision to  refuse  to  issue  her  with  a
permanent residence card under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations"), as the former family member of  an
EEA national who has retained a right of residence in the UK upon divorce.

The appellant was previously issued with a residence card  on  28  September
2010, valid until 28 September 2015, following  her  marriage  to  a  French
national on 15 December  2008.  She  was  divorced  from  her  EEA  national
sponsor on 28 August 2015. On 16 September 2015 the appellant applied for  a
permanent residence card under the EEA Regulations  2006  on  the  basis  of
retained rights upon divorce. Her application was  refused  on  15  February
2016 and her appeal against that decision was dismissed  by  the  First-tier
Tribunal on 28 June 2017. On 27 July 2017 the appellant applied again for  a
permanent residence card under the EEA Regulations 2016 as a  family  member
who had retained a right of residence  upon  divorce.  Her  application  was
refused on 30 October 2017.

The appellant's application was refused on three grounds. Firstly,  she  had
failed to produce her former spouse's valid passport  or  national  identity
card and had failed to submit any  evidence  to  show  that  she  could  not
obtain the required  documentation.  Secondly  the  respondent  relied  upon
findings made by the First-Tier Tribunal Judge in the  appellant's  previous
appeal, and the lack of further evidence, as to gaps  in  the  EEA  national
family  member's  Treaty  rights  such  that  he  could  not  demonstrate  a
continuous period  of  five  years  of  residence  in  accordance  with  the
regulations. Such gaps arose as a result of a  refusal  to  accept  the  EEA
national's  claimed  self-employment  with  Clean  Space  Partnership   from
January 2013 to January 2015.  Thirdly, the  respondent  made  reference  to
the  appellant's  former  spouse's  registration  certificate  having   been
revoked on 28 June 2016 as his identity and/or  personal  details  had  been
identified as participating in an organised marriage and a benefit fraud.

The appellant's appeal against that decision was  heard  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal by Judge Bennett on 30 November 2018.  Judge  Bennett  accorded  no
weight to the respondent's third reason as there had been no assertion  that
the marriage was one of convenience. With regard to  the  first  reason,  he
found at [36(g)] that adequate alternative evidence of  the  EEA  national's
identity had been produced. With regard to  the  second  reason,  the  judge
noted the previous First-tier Tribunal's finding that  the  requirements  of
regulation 10(5) and (6) of the 2006 Regulations had not  been  met  as  the
appellant had failed to show that the relevant EEA national was a  qualified
person at the date of the  divorce.  He  considered  himself  bound  by  the
previous Tribunal's finding rejecting the appellant's  claim  in  regard  to
the  EEA  National's  self-employment  with  Clean  Space  Partnership   and
therefore did not accept that the EEA national was exercising treaty  rights
from 13 August 2013 to 9 April 2014 or 12 April 2014 until 24 January  2015.
However Judge Bennett's findings at [30(d) and (e)] and  [33(d)]  were  that
the EEA national remained a qualified person, by virtue of  his  employment,
from 25 January 2015 until 18 March  2016,  and  that  he  was  a  qualified
person at the time the divorce petition was presented. He accepted that  the
appellant was residing in the UK in accordance with the 2016 Regulations  by
virtue of regulation 14(2). The judge nevertheless found that the  appellant
did not qualify for a permanent right of residence - at  [33](e)]  he  found
that she did not qualify under regulation  15(1)(b)  because  there  was  no
continuous period  of  five  years  of  residence  in  accordance  with  the
regulations in the period up to 25 August 2015 and at [34(f)] he found  that
the appellant did not qualify under regulation 15(1)(f) because  five  years
had not  elapsed since 25 January 2015.

Permission to appeal that decision was sought and  granted  on  the  grounds
that the judge had arguably erred by imposing an extra requirement  of  five
years continuous work by the EEA national.

At the hearing Mr Walker accepted that Judge Bennett had  erred  in  law  by
requiring there to be a five year period  of  the  EEA  national  exercising
treaty rights. He conceded that, on the findings the  judge  had  made,  the
appellant had established a retained  right  and  met  the  requirements  of
regulations 10(5) and 14(3). Mr Walker did not agree that the appellant  had
demonstrated an entitlement to permanent residence and  submitted  that  the
judge had not erred by finding as such, but he conceded that the appeal  had
to be allowed on the basis that the decision was not in accordance with  the
EEA Regulations 2016.

Mr Garrod, in response, agreed that the appeal should  be  allowed  on  that
basis and that it was then open to the appellant to make an  application  to
the  respondent  for  a  permanent  residence  card.  Although  he  was  not
conceding that the judge was entitled to make the findings that  he  did  on
entitlement to permanent residence and although he did not  agree  with  the
judge's findings at [21] in regard to his  inability  to  deviate  from  the
previous  Tribunal's  findings  on  the  appellant's   self-employment,   he
confirmed that he was not pursuing a challenge to the  decision  in  respect
to permanent residence.

In view of Mr Walker's concession, there is no  need  for  me  to  make  any
detailed findings. In any event it is clear,  when  taking  Judge  Bennett's
findings at [30(d) and (e)] together with his findings at [33d)]  and  [34],
that he should have  found  that  the  appellant  met  the  requirements  in
regulations [10(5)] and [14(3)] and was entitled  to  a  retained  right  of
residence in the UK upon divorce, albeit that she had  not  demonstrated  an
entitlement to permanent residence. The appeal is therefore allowed on  that
basis.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law. The decision is set aside and is  re-made  by
allowing the  appellant's  appeal  under  the  EEA  Regulations  2016,  with
reference to regulation 10(5) and 14(3).
