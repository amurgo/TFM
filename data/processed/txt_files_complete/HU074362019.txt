For the Appellant:     J Gajjar, Counsel instructed by Regal Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    No submissions received


                            DECISION AND REASONS

  Background

    1. The appellant is appealing against a decision of Judge of the  First-
       tier Tribunal Devittie promulgated on 21 October 2019. Permission  to
       appeal was granted on 11 February 2020. The hearing was listed for  8
       April 2020. However, because of the Covid-19  pandemic,  the  hearing
       was postponed. Directions were issued by the Vice  President  of  the
       Upper  Tribunal  giving  the  provisional  view  that  it  would   be
       appropriate to determine the  error  of  law  issue  in  this  appeal
       without  a  hearing.  The  parties  were  directed  to  make  further
       submissions in writing and given an opportunity to express their view
       on whether a hearing would be necessary. Mr Gajjar, on behalf of  the
       appellant, submitted submissions dated 12 April 2020. No objection to
       the appeal being  determined  without  a  hearing  was  made  in  the
       submissions. Submissions from the respondent have not been  received.
       Having  considered  Mr  Gajjar's  submissions  alongside  the   other
       relevant documents (including the bundle of documents that was before
       the First-tier Tribunal), I am satisfied that I am in a  position  to
       determine this appeal fairly and justly without a hearing.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of India who was born on 11 July 1973.  He
       claims to have been in the UK continuously since 1994  and  therefore
       that he satisfies the condition of  para.  276  ADE  (1)(iii)  (lived
       continuously in the UK for at least  20  years)  of  the  Immigration
       Rules.

    3. In support of  his  application  to  the  respondent,  the  appellant
       submitted multiple tenancy agreements, covering  the  period  between
       1994 and 2016. In the respondent's refusal letter dated 8 April 2019,
       it is stated that the tenancy agreement paperwork was not  sufficient
       and that it was expected that the appellant would be able to  provide
       additional evidence from other sources.

    4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  where  his  appeal
       was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Devittie ("the judge").
       In a decision promulgated on 21 October 2019, the judge dismissed the
       appeal.

  Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

    5. The judge found  that  the  appellant  had  not  provided  sufficient
       evidence to establish 20 years continuous residence  in  the  UK.  At
       para.6, the judge stated:

           "The only documentary evidence he has  presented  to  show  long
           residence are the tenancy agreements. If it is the case that  he
           was able to secure a tenancy in his name it must follow that  he
           was engaged in some form of economic activity and therefore some
           financial transactions which would be recorded showing his name.
           The evidence  of  his  friend,  standing  alone,  if  [sic]  not
           sufficient  to  show  long  residence.  I  do  not  accept   his
           explanation that he  could  not,  after  a  20  year  period  of
           residence, have called other witnesses to support his claim. His
           explanation that all his potential witnesses  had  travelled  to
           India does not in my view merit belief."

    6. The judge also  found  that  there  would  not  be  very  significant
       obstacles to the appellant's integration in India.




  Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

    7. The grounds of appeal argue  that,  because  he  was  living  without
       status, it was irrational to expect the appellant to have documentary
       evidence of his presence in the UK other than the tenancy agreements.
       Reliance is placed on the observation of Beatson LJ at  para.  61  of
       Khan, R (on the application of) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
       Department [2016] EWCA Civ 416, that:

           "It is likely that those in the United  Kingdom  without  leave,
           and  therefore   without   status,   will   have   no   official
           documentation,  particularly  in  the  early  period  of   their
           residence. Thirdly, although most of the documents listed by the
           Secretary of State can be classified as "official" in the  sense
           that they are from institutions and not individuals,  a  tenancy
           agreement and a letter from a landlord, which  are  listed,  are
           difficult to classify as "official"."

    8. The grounds note that the judge did not raise  an  issue  as  to  the
       authenticity of the tenancy agreements.

    9. In addition to the rationality challenge, the grounds submit that the
       judge erred by failing to  give  adequate  reasons  for  finding  the
       tenancy agreements were insufficient.

   10. Mr Gajjar's submissions reiterate the points made in the  grounds  of
       appeal. They also set out a list of the tenancy agreements adduced by
       the appellant, which cover the period between 1994 and 2016, and note
       that the appellant's claim was corroborated by letters from friends.

  Analysis

   11. As noted in Khan, a person in the UK without status can  be  expected
       to lack official documentation. That does not mean, however, that  in
       all  cases  they  will  lack  any  -  or  almost  any-   non-official
       documentation. The amount, and nature, of documentation a person will
       have will vary depending on their circumstances.

   12. The appellant adduced, in order to demonstrate continuous  residency,
       multiple formal tenancy agreements covering the period 1994 to  2016.
       Several of the agreements indicate that he was paying  a  substantial
       amount of money in rent. For example, an  agreement  dated  13  March
       2014 - 2016 specifies a monthly rent of ï¿½1,050.

   13. As stated at para 90.2 of R (Iran) and others v SSHD [2005] EWCA  Civ
       982:

           "A finding might only be set aside  for  error  of  law  on  the
           grounds of perversity if it was irrational  or  unreasonable  in
           the Wednesbury sense, or one that was wholly unsupported by  the
           evidence."

   14.  Given  that  the  appellant  was  able  to  provide  formal  tenancy
       agreements covering the entirety of the period in question  and  that
       these indicate that he  was,  for  some  of  that  period,  paying  a
       substantial sum of money in rent, it was not irrational  or  perverse
       for the judge to find that the appellant would have been  engaged  in
       some form of economic activity and therefore that  there  would  have
       been at least some financial transactions recorded in his name.   The
       judge was therefore entitled - and it was not irrational  -  to  find
       that, in the circumstances of this case, the tenancy agreements  were
       not sufficient in the absence of any other  documentary  evidence  to
       establish residency in the UK.

   15. I am also not satisfied that there is merit to the appellant's  claim
       that the judge failed to give adequate reasons. Although the decision
       is brief, a tribunal's reasons need not be extensive if the  decision
       makes sense: see para.11 of MK (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013]
       UKUT 641 (IAC). It is clear  (in  particular  from  para.  6  of  the
       decision, cited above  at  para.5)  that  the  judge  identified  and
       recorded in a way that is readily  understandable  why  he  concluded
       that the appellant had not provided sufficient evidence to  establish
       continuous residence. Those reasons, in summary, are that  (a)  given
       the appellant was able to secure tenancy  agreements  he  would  have
       been engaged in economic activity which would have produced at  least
       some records; (b) the evidence of his friend  was  insufficient  (the
       friend had only known him since 2002,  and  therefore  taken  at  its
       highest this evidence did not show 20 years of  residence);  and  (c)
       the  appellant  did  not  call  any  other  witnesses  and  gave   an
       explanation for their absence (that they had travelled to India) that
       the judge did not find merited belief.

   16. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the  judge  was  entitled,  for  the
       reasons he gave, to not accept that the appellant had resided in  the
       UK for a continuous period of 20 years. The grounds therefore do  not
       identify an error of law.

  Decision

   17. The appeal is dismissed. The making of the decision of the First-tier
       Tribunal did not involve the making  of  an  error  of  law  and  the
       decision stands.
