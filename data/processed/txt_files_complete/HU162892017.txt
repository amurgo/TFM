                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh. On 29 August 2017 he
      applied for leave to remain on the basis of his family life with his
      British wife. This was refused on 17 November 2017.

   2. His application had been considered under appendix FM of the
      immigration rules. The refusal was on the basis he did not meet the
      suitability requirements. On 24 February 2012 he had applied for
      further leave to remain as a student. He had submitted an English
      language testing certificate. The test was taken at Westlink College,
      Essex on 18 October 2011.Based upon information from the Educational
      Testing Service (ETS)the respondent concluded the certificate had been
      obtained by deception, namely, by the use of a proxy test taker. In
      light of such conduct the respondent concluded his continued presence
      in the United Kingdom would not be in the public interest.

The First tier Tribunal

   3. His appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio on 2 April
      2019. In a decision promulgated on 30 April 2019 his appeal was
      dismissed. The judge concluded he had obtained the test certificate
      fraudulently as alleged. Consequently, the judge found he did not meet
      the suitability requirements in the rules.

   4. The judge was not dealing with the matter directly under the rules but
      through the prism of the rules. Having found the rules were not met
      the judge then went on to consider the appeal in the context of
      article 8 beyond the specific rules. In particular, the judge
      considered the proportionality of the decision in relation to his
      married life. The respondent had accepted a genuine and subsisting
      relationship but concluded that family life could continue in
      Bangladesh.

   5. First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio concluded the decision was
      proportionate. The judge continued to accept the existence of family
      life. The judge referred to the appellant's precarious immigration
      status. His wife is a British citizen who has lived in the United
      Kingdom for 20 years and is employed here. The judge acknowledged she
      would find it difficult to adjust to life in Bangladesh. The judge
      concluded the consequences of the decision would be that the appellant
      and his wife would be separated, at least temporarily. The judge felt
      the appellant could integrate again into life in Bangladesh. Bearing
      in mind the finding in relation to suitability the judge concluded the
      decision was proportionate.

The Upper Tribunal

   6. The challenge to the decision relates to the proxy allegation.
      Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on the basis
      there was no evidence that showed a continuous link between the voice
      recordings analysed and the impugned test result relating to the
      appellant. The appellant had accepted that the voice recording was of
      someone other than himself. However, it was arguable this fact alone
      was an insufficient basis for the judge to conclude the test had been
      taken by a proxy. It was also arguable the judge had conflated the
      legal burden with the evidential burden.

   7. Mr Biggs appeared for the appellant as he did in the First-tier
      Tribunal. He relied upon the grounds for which permission was granted.
      He submitted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had not properly
      applied MA (ETS-TOEIC testing) [2016] UKUT 00450.He argued that the
      respondent had not made an evidential link to show the voice recording
      analysed related to the appellant.

   8. The second argument advanced was that the judge had conflated the
      evidential burden with the legal burden. An evidential burden is not a
      burden of proof. In the context of a `proxy' appeal the legal burden
      always remained with the respondent. The evidential burden is
      initially upon the respondent to show a case to answer. If this is
      done by evidence then it is then for the appellant to explain. The
      third stage is then consideration of these two aspects in order to
      consider whether the respondent has discharged the legal burden of
      proof.

   9. In the decision the judge has used phrases which indicates the
      distinction between the legal and the evidential burden has not been
      demonstrated. For instance, the grounds assert that the judge treated
      the appellant as subject to a true burden of proof rather than an
      evidential burden. To illustrate this, reference is made to paragraph
      9 where the judge stated the appellant 'must show that there is an
      innocent explanation'. At paragraph 24 the judge referred to the
      argument of Mr Biggs that it had not been demonstrated by evidence
      that the recording related to the appellant. The judge stated:

         "The difficulty with that argument is that the voice recording has
         been linked to the Appellant's result and the Appellant has
         admitted that it is not his voice sic: read [.This] leads to only
         one conclusion that a proxy test taker must have taken his test for
         him. This coupled with the fact that the test has been declared
         invalid makes it difficult for the appellant to provide an innocent
         explanation."

Later in the same paragraph the judge refers to the appellant not having
the benefit of the doubt. Reference was then made to paragraph 25, where
the judge stated `I find that the evidence adduced by the appellant in
rebuttal has not been sufficient'.

  10. Mr Biggs was not pursuing the third ground advanced

  11. Mr Walker accepted that the judge's comments at paragraph 24 that
      there could only to one conclusion from the appellant admitting it is
      not his voice was too sweeping. On this basis he acknowledged that
      there was a material error of law in the decision.



Conclusion.

  12. On the basis of the arguments advanced and the acceptance of a
      material error of law by the presenting officer it is my conclusion
      that the decision cannot be sustained. Consequently, the matter should
      be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a rehearing. It is
      agreed that the undisputed finding that the voice recording analysed
      does not relate to the appellant is preserved.

  13. There is merit in the point made by Mr Biggs in relation to the proofs
      to show a continuous link of proofs that the voice recording analysed
      related to the appellant. The Upper Tribunal in MA( ETS-TOEIC
      testing)[2016] UKUT 00450  considered this point but this did not form
      part of the ratio. A case management review raised the question of
      whether the appellant's voice had been properly recorded and
      transferred to ETS and whether the voice recordings provided by ETS to
      the Upper Tribunal related to the test which he took. The respondent
      argued that the central issue was whether the appellant used a proxy
      to undertake the speaking test and that this encompassed these two
      issues. The Upper Tribunal referred to a prehearing meeting with three
      experts engaged in computing and database programming. This is set out
      in detail at paragraph 15 of the decision. It refers to candidates
      being required to register on a computer their personal details and
      their passport and there was software known as a Manager Application
      recording each candidates responses. The experts accepted a lack of
      clarity in relation to the process. The material is not available in
      the present appeal to properly consider this point further and in any
      event given outcome on the other point argued it is not necessary.

Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio materially errs in law and
is set aside. The deal is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a
rehearing. The agreed finding that the voice recording is not the appellant
is preserved.




Signed   date: 20 July 2019
Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Farrelly.


Directions

   1. For the convenience of the appellant and his representatives the
      matter should be relisted if possible in Taylor House, excluding First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Adio.
   2. A hearing time of under two hours can be anticipated.
   3. An interpreter is not required.
   4. The respondent's papers contain a criminal enquiry known as Project
      Faï¿½ade in respect of Westlink College. There is also documentation in
      relation to overall test results during a relevant period for the
      present appeal. The papers also contain the lookup tool relating to
      the appellant. These should be included in any new bundle. If the
      respondent can provide any more background information about how the
      voice recording produced is linked to the appellant's test it would be
      helpful.
   5. Should the respondent establish a case for the appellant to answer
      then on rehearing the judge can assess the appellant's explanation and
      then consider the totality of the evidence to see whether the
      respondent has discharged the legal burden.
   6. It is open to the appellant's representatives to provide any further
      evidence relevant to the appellant's family life which can be taken
      into account in assessing the proportionality of the decision. If
      there have been any material changes in circumstances, such as a birth
      of a child since, they should so advise the respondent so as to avoid
      any adjournment application.
