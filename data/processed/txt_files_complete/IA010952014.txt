                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

 DECISION ON WITHDRAWAL PURSUANT TO RULE 17 OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
                            TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. This appeal came before me following a grant of  permission  to  appeal
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Balloch  who  dismissed
    an appeal against a decision by the respondent to  refuse  to  issue  a
    residence card.

 2. At the hearing before me the appellant sought to withdraw  the  appeal.
    Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  provides
    that a party may give notice of the withdrawal of its case or  part  of
    it, subject to the consent of the Upper Tribunal. There is no provision
    for a party to withdraw the appeal before the  Upper  Tribunal.  Having
    accepted that the purported withdrawal of the appellant's appeal is  in
    effect a withdrawal of the appellant's case before the Upper  Tribunal,
    I consented to that withdrawal.

 3. The effect therefore, is that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    is to stand.



Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek    3/11/15
