Representation:

For the appellant:     On 31st July 2013, the appellant in person
     On 5th September 2013, Mr R Solomon, counsel, instructed by A &   P
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Mauritius, born on  28th  February  1984.
    Her appeal against the decision of the respondent, made on 15th October
    2012, refusing her application for  further  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant  under  paragraph
    245ZX of HC 395, as amended, was dismissed under the immigration  rules
    after a hearing before First-tier Tribunal Judge Wellesley-Cole,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 22nd January 2013. The First-tier Tribunal
    judge did not determine the appellant's human rights grounds of  appeal
    under article 8 of the ECHR.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted in the First-tier Tribunal and on  2nd
    April 2013 Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Mailer found that the First-tier
    Tribunal judge had made an error on a point of law in her determination
    of the appeal for reasons set out in the appendix hereto.

 3. Thus the appeal came before me on 1st  July  2013  when  I  heard  oral
    evidence from the appellant and  her  twin  sister,  Ms  Marie  Melissa
    Karine Sandian.  A remarkable feature of the appeal  is  that  I  heard
    evidence from the appellant and her sister, which I accept because  the
    manner  in  which  each  of  them  gave  evidence  demonstrated   their
    credibility and their immigration history as set  out  in  Mr  Melvin's
    skeleton argument/written submissions confirmed what they  said,  which
    showed that they entered the United Kingdom as students more or less at
    the same time and although they followed different  courses  initially,
    ultimately they both completed a Diploma in Business Administration  at
    the same college, namely the London College of Further  Studies,  after
    which they went on to study other identical  courses  together  at  the
    same colleges. I accept the appellant's evidence that she was depressed
    by being separated from her twin sister and so decided to live  at  the
    same address and  follow  the  same  courses.   While  the  appellant's
    application for further leave to remain to embark upon a course leading
    to a postgraduate diploma in Hospitality and Tourism Management at  the
    International School of Business  Studies  was  refused,  an  identical
    application on the part of her sister was granted by the respondent.

 4. The appellant's application was refused by the Secretary  of  State  on
    the grounds that she did not have the necessary level of funds,  namely
    �7,200 and also on the grounds that application was made  on  3rd  July
    2012 and the closing date of the bank statements submitted  in  support
    of her application were dated 16th May 2012, namely more than one month
    prior to the date of application.

 5. During the course of the hearing  before  me  on  31st  July  2013  the
    appellant claimed that she had an established presence studying in  the
    United Kingdom and so was obliged to show funds totalling �1,600  only,
    in accordance with the criterion following paragraph 11 of  Appendix  C
    to HC 395, as amended because, at  the  date  of  the  application,  as
    required by paragraph 14, she had current leave to remain as a  Tier  4
    Migrant Student and an established  presence  studying  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 6. The relevant part of paragraph 14 provided as follows:

         "An applicant will have an established presence

          studying in the UK if the applicant has ... leave to remain  as  a
          Tier 4 migrant...and at the date of the application:

         (i)  has finished a single course that was at least six months long
             within the applicant's last period of ... leave to remain, or

          ..."

 7. At the first hearing Mr Melvin conceded that  the  application  of  the
    appellant had been made on the date she claimed, namely 31st  May  2012
    but did not accept that the appellant  had  in  fact  attended  at  the
    college so as to comply  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph  14  of
    Appendix C.

 8. As the appellant was unrepresented and had not expected this  point  to
    be taken against her I adjourned the hearing to enable her  to  produce
    evidence that she had in fact attended the college, which she presented
    at the hearing before me on 5th September 2013.  After consideration of
    that evidence Mr Melvin, on behalf of the respondent, conceded that she
    had in fact attended the college as claimed.

 9. Both representatives were agreed that the remaining issue  in  relation
    to the appeal under the  immigration  rules  was  whether  or  not  the
    appellant had an established  presence  as  a  student  in  the  United
    Kingdom at the date of the application, and alternatively  in  relation
    to the appeal on human rights grounds under article 8 of the  ECHR  the
    issue was whether the fact that her sister  had  been  granted  further
    leave in identical circumstances meant that her removal in  consequence
    of the decision to refuse further leave amounted to a  disproportionate
    interference with the right to respect for her private life.

10. Mr Solomon indicated that he did not wish to call any further  evidence
    and therefore I proceeded to hear submissions made on  behalf  of  both
    parties, which in effect encapsulated the written  arguments  contained
    in the reply on behalf of the appellant from  Mr  Solomon,  dated  29th
    July 2013, and the respondent's skeleton  argument/written  submissions
    from Mr Melvin dated 4th September 2013.

11. I have set out the relevant requirements of paragraph 14 of Appendix  C
    above. Mr Solomon argued that there had been a change of wording in the
    immigration  rules.   The  previous  requirement  for  an   established
    presence studying  in  the  United  Kingdom,  of  an  applicant  having
    completed a course that was at least six months long  within  the  last
    period of leave as a Tier 4 Migrant  and  the  course  having  finished
    within the last four months, had been changed to a requirement that  he
    should have finished a single course that was at least six months  long
    within his last period of leave to remain.  Mr Solomon relied upon  the
    respondent's Modernised Guidance on Tier 4, valid from  25th  September
    2012, a copy of which was attached to his  reply,  which  set  out  the
    definition of established presence as a student in the  United  Kingdom
    contained in paragraph 14 of Appendix C and went on to state:

         "If the  applicant's  study  has  been  interrupted  (for  example,
         because their sponsor's Tier 4 licence was revoked) they will still
         qualify as having an established presence providing  at  least  six
         months of the course has been completed by the date  on  which  the
         studies were interrupted."

12. Mr Melvin conceded that if the appellant had  an  established  presence
    studying in the United Kingdom then she was not required  to  show  any
    more than �1,600 which she had been able to do.   He  argued,  however,
    that the summer vacation interrupted her studies.

13. In  his  skeleton  argument/written  submissions,  although  Mr  Melvin
    referred to the decision  of  the  High  Court  in  Mumba,  R  (on  the
    application of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2012]
    EWHC 508 (Admin) and quoted paragraph 21 of the  judgement,  which  set
    out the amended version of paragraph 14 of Appendix C,  he  argued,  in
    reliance upon the determination of the Tribunal in  Molla  (established
    presence - date of application) Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 161 (IAC),  that
    the appellant had to have completed a course of  at  least  six  months
    long and had to have been studying within the  last  four  months.   He
    quoted incorrectly from the part  of  the  paragraph  dealing  with  an
    application for continued study.  More accurately he should  have  said
    that the paragraph, considered in Molla required  the  course  to  have
    finished within the last four months.  The situation is, however,  that
    the paragraph referred to in Molla had been  amended  and  was  not  in
    force at the date of the decision in the appellant's case.

14. In his skeleton argument/written submissions Mr  Melvin  also  asserted
    that the appellant's own evidence was that the college had  closed  for
    the summer vacation on 11th June 2011 and never re-opened.  The  course
    had begun on 31st January 2011 so that the appellant had not finished a
    course that was at least six months long.

15. Mr Melvin also argued there was a lengthy period of  time  between  the
    revocation of the appellant's sponsor's  licence,  which  was  conceded
    took place on 28th September 2011 and the date of  her  application  on
    31st May 2012.  He submitted that if the appellant had  an  established
    presence it would mean that if an  applicant's  sponsor's  licence  had
    been revoked six months into his course he could then sit back  and  do
    nothing until shortly before the period of his leave expired  and  then
    claim to have had an established presence in the United  Kingdom  as  a
    student.

16. In relation to the first point made by  Mr  Melvin,  that  a  student's
    vacation has to be left out of account in  calculating  the  length  of
    time that he has been following a course, I accept the submission  made
    by Mr Solomon, that the period of a  vacation  which  occurs  during  a
    course does not have to be left  out  of  account  in  calculating  the
    length of the course..  Where, as in this  case,  the  appellant's  BSc
    course in Business Management was to run from 31st January 2011 to 31st
    January 2014 it is not possible to say that the course came to  an  end
    at the beginning of any period of vacation and resumed  again  only  at
    the end of the particular vacation.

17. By way of illustration, there is a requirement in paragraph 245ZV(g) of
    HC 395, as amended, that if the course is below degree level the  grant
    of entry clearance the applicant  is  seeking  must  not  lead  to  the
    applicant having spent more than 3 years in the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    Tier 4 Migrant since the age  of  18  studying  courses  that  did  not
    consist of degree level study.  It  would  be  remarkable  if  such  an
    applicant were able to deduct from the length of time he  had  been  in
    the United Kingdom the total length of his vacations,  on  the  grounds
    that they were excluded from the length of time he was studying.

18. In relation to the second point made by Mr  Melvin,  I  note  that  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  judge  described  the  appellant  as  having   an
    unblemished immigration history and as a straightforward appellant  who
    gave evidence in good faith for the purposes of the hearing.   I  found
    her to be an honest and reliable  witness  and  in  the  light  of  the
    further documentation she submitted I accept that she was not aware  of
    the fact that the sponsorship licence of the  London  Business  Academy
    had been revoked until she received an e-mail on behalf of the  academy
    on 9th January 2012.  It does appear that the Secretary  of  State  did
    nothing to notify the appellant of the revocation of  the  licence  and
    did not give her the opportunity of finding a new  sponsor  during  the
    course of her existing leave to remain, which did not expire until 30th
    July 2012.

19. Although it is the case that the respondent's guidance cannot be  taken
    to be a definitive interpretation of the immigration rules, nonetheless
    in this case it is apparent that the previous version of  paragraph  14
    of Appendix C which provided as follows:

         "An applicant will have an established  presence  studying  in  the
         United Kingdom if the applicant has completed a course that was  at
         least six months long within their last period of leave as a Tier 4
         Migrant ... and the course finished within  the  last  four  months
         ..."

    was deleted from the immigration rules with effect from 21st April 2011
    by HC 908 and was replaced by the version to which I have referred.  In
    DN (Student - course 'completed' - established presence)  Kenya  [2010]
    UKUT 443 the Tribunal decided that completed did not mean  successfully
    completed.  Since that determination was promulgated the  Secretary  of
    State has chosen to amend  paragraph  14  of  Appendix  C  so  that  an
    applicant is not required to have completed a course  and  has  removed
    the requirement that the course should have finished within the  period
    of four months prior to the date  of  the  application.   The  guidance
    shows what the policy of the Secretary of  State  is  and  in  my  view
    giving the word "finished" its ordinary meaning I am satisfied that the
    appellant had finished a course which had run for six months, when  her
    sponsor's licence was revoked and by the date of her application.

20. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the appellant complied  with
    the requirements of the immigration rules and therefore I  re-make  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal by allowing her  appeal  under  the
    immigration rules.

21. So far as the appellant's article 8 grounds of appeal are concerned, an
    important element of the appellant's private life is  her  relationship
    with her sister as well as all of the other contacts that she has  made
    during the course of her time in the United Kingdom, which has  spanned
    a period now of almost ten years, so that the  appellant's  removal  in
    consequence of the decision would have consequences of such gravity  as
    to engage article 8 of the ECHR.  I am satisfied the decision was  made
    in accordance with the law.  So far as whether or not it was  necessary
    and proportionate, there cannot be any public interest in  her  removal
    given that she complies with the requirements of the immigration rules.



22. Even if I were wrong in finding that the appellant  complied  with  the
    requirements of the immigration rules, in my view the  public  interest
    in the appellant's removal is weakened dramatically by the fact that in
    identical circumstances her sister was granted  leave  to  remain.   It
    matters not, in my view, that the matter was dealt with by a  different
    caseworker, as asserted  by  Mr  Melvin,  what  is  important  is  that
    different treatment was afforded to the appellant from that  which  was
    afforded to her sister, in identical circumstances.

23. In these circumstances I also allow the appeal on human rights  grounds
    under article 8 of the ECHR on the basis that the  appellant's  removal
    would amount to a  disproportionate  interference  with  her  right  to
    respect for her private life.

24. Following the finding by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Mailer  that  the
    decision to remove under section 47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006 was unlawful, I  allow  the  appeal  against  that
    decision on the grounds that it was not in accordance with the law.


Signed                              Dated

P A Spencer
Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                  Appendix


  "REASONS FOR FINDING THAT THE TRIBUNAL MADE AN ERROR OF LAW SUCH THAT ITS
                       DECISION FALLS TO BE SET ASIDE


1.   The appellant is a national of Mauritius  born  on  28  February  1984.
    Her appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse her  application
    for leave to remain  as  a  tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant  under
    paragraph 245ZX (d) of the rules was dismissed by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Wellesley-Cole in a determination dated 2nd January 2013.

2.   On the 11 February 2013 First-tier Judge Pooler granted her  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal as  it  was  arguable  that  the  Judge
    failed to make a finding: as to the date on which the  application  was
    made and in consequence misdirected herself in reaching findings as  to
    the availability of funds; as to whether funds in her parents'  name(s)
    could be relied on and failed to take account of a fact - the  exchange
    rate at the date of application which was in the public domain.

3.   Mr Solomon submitted that the Judge should have allowed the  appeal  on
    the basis that there was a s.47 decision to remove the  appellant  made
    at the same time as  the  decision  to  refuse  to  vary  her  leave  -
    Adamally.  Ms Martin accepted that this is an unlawful decision.

4.   Further, the appellant had contended throughout that  she  had  applied
    on the 31st May 2012 and not as asserted by the respondent on the  23rd
    July 2012.  There were 2 stamps endorsed on the application, one on the
    1st June 2012 the other on the 24th July 2012.  The Judge  should  have
    resolved that issue as the closing balance of her bank statement at the
    earlier  date  was  no  earlier  than  31  days  before  the  date   of
    application.  Having  found  the  appellant  to  be  a  straightforward
    witness she should have given proper reasons for not accepting that the
    appellant applied on the 31st May 2012.

5.   Further, given that the appellant had an established  presence  in  the
    UK she had to show a lesser amount of maintenance namely,  only  �1600.
    The bank statements showed a sufficient level between 19 April  and  16
    May 2012.  He relied on DN [2010] UKUT 443.  The notion of 'established
    presence' requires presence as a student, not  success  as  a  student.
    The Rule had changed by the end of May 2012.  Her sponsor's licence was
    revoked before the end of her course and she was  not,  as  she  should
    have been, given any opportunity to find another college.

6.    Finally,  the  spot  exchange  rate  was  in  the  public  domain  and
    uncontentious.  In addition the Judge erred in stating  that  the  bank
    statements were not certified.  They in fact bore the official stamp on
    every page of the respondent's bundle.

7.   Ms Martin submitted that the appellant  had  not  finished  her  course
    because of the termination of the sponsor's licence.  She accepted that
    the appellant had  not  been  given  an  opportunity  to  find  another
    college.  She had not shown that she had an established presence.

8.   Having considered the competing submissions I find there  has  been  an
    error of law in  the  making  of  the  decision.   The  Judge  has  not
    attempted to resolve the issue of the date of the  application,  simply
    stating that her sister's application may have been confused  with  her
    own.  She set out the appellant's contentions at  paragraph  6  and  7.
    However apart from referring to the fact of  two  stamps  she  did  not
    consider  the  potential  relevance  of  the  date  of  application  in
    assessing the bank statements concerned.  It appears that the appellant
    had given compelling evidence in that regard and  had  produced  proper
    proof of posting.  Further, no consideration was given  as  to  whether
    she had an established presence in the UK.

9.   The Judge found that the appellant had  not  shown  that  she  has  the
    equivalent funds in terms of 'English currency - para 8'.  That however
    was capable of being simply and uncontroversially ascertained  using  a
    currency converter.  She also appeared to find that the appellant could
    not rely on her parents' bank account - para 9.

10.  I accordingly find that the decision  of  the  Judge  did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I set aside the  decision  which
    will have to be remade.

11.  The case should be listed for a Case Management Review  not  less  than
    14 days after the date on which this decision is sent to  the  parties,
    with a time estimate of 1 hour.  Directions, including the  appropriate
    disposal of the appeal, can then be considered."
